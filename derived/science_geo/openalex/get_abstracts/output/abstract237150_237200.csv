https://openalex.org/W2066334438,"Controlling interparticle interactions, aggregation and cluster formation is of central importance in a number of areas, ranging from cluster formation in various disease processes to protein crystallography and the production of photonic crystals. Recent developments in the description of the interaction of colloidal particles with short-range attractive potentials have led to interesting findings including metastable liquid–liquid phase separation and the formation of dynamically arrested states (such as the existence of attractive and repulsive glasses, and transient gels)1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The emerging glass paradigm has been successfully applied to complex soft-matter systems, such as colloid–polymer systems8 and concentrated protein solutions9. However, intriguing problems like the frequent occurrence of cluster phases remain10,11,12,13. Here we report small-angle scattering and confocal microscopy investigations of two model systems: protein solutions and colloid–polymer mixtures. We demonstrate that in both systems, a combination of short-range attraction and long-range repulsion results in the formation of small equilibrium clusters. We discuss the relevance of this finding for nucleation processes during protein crystallization, protein or DNA self-assembly and the previously observed formation of cluster and gel phases in colloidal suspensions12,13,14,15,16,17."
https://openalex.org/W2163142987,"The information carrier of today's communications, a weak pulse of light, is an intrinsically quantum object. As a consequence, complete information about the pulse cannot be perfectly recorded in a classical memory, even in principle. In the field of quantum information, this has led to the long-standing challenge of how to achieve a high-fidelity transfer of an independently prepared quantum state of light onto an atomic quantum state. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for such a quantum memory based on atomic ensembles. Recording of an externally provided quantum state of light onto the atomic quantum memory is achieved with 70 per cent fidelity, significantly higher than the limit for classical recording. Quantum storage of light is achieved in three steps: first, interaction of the input pulse and an entangling field with spin-polarized caesium atoms; second, subsequent measurement of the transmitted light; and third, feedback onto the atoms using a radio-frequency magnetic pulse conditioned on the measurement result. The density of recorded states is 33 per cent higher than the best classical recording of light onto atoms, with a quantum memory lifetime of up to 4 milliseconds."

We show that fibroblast-like cells derived from adult human islets donated postmortem proliferate readily in vitro. These mesenchymal-type cells, which exhibit no hormone expression, can then be induced to differentiate into hormone-expressing islet-like cell aggregates, which reestablishes the epithelial character typical of islet cells. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and messenger RNA measurements in single cells and cell populations establish the transition of epithelial cells within islets to mesenchymal cells in culture and then to insulin-expressing epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2161215121,"Bile acids are transported across the ileal enterocyte brush border membrane by the well characterized apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt) Slc10a2; however, the carrier(s) responsible for transporting bile acids across the ileocyte basolateral membrane into the portal circulation have not been fully identified. Transcriptional profiling of wild type and Slc10a2 null mice was employed to identify a new candidate basolateral bile acid carrier, the heteromeric organic solute transporter (Ost)α-Ostβ. By Northern blot analysis, Ostα and Ostβ mRNA was detected only in mouse kidney and intestine, mirroring the horizontal gradient of expression of Asbt in the gastrointestinal tract. Analysis of Ostα and Ostβ protein expression by immunohistochemistry localized both subunits to the basolateral surface of the mouse ileal enterocyte. The transport properties of Ostα-Ostβ were analyzed in stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Co-expression of mouse Ostα-Ostβ, but not the individual subunits, stimulated Na+-independent bile acid uptake and the apical-to-basolateral transport of taurocholate. In contrast, basolateral-to-apical transport was not affected by Ostα-Ostβ expression. Co-expression of Ostα and Ostβ was required to convert the Ostα subunit to a mature glycosylated endoglycosidase H-resistant form, suggesting that co-expression facilitates the trafficking of Ostα through the Golgi apparatus. Immunolocalization studies showed that co-expression was necessary for plasma membrane expression of both Ostα and Ostβ. These results demonstrate that the mouse Ostα-Ostβ heteromeric transporter is a basolateral bile acid carrier and may be responsible for bile acid efflux in ileum and other ASBT-expressing tissues. Bile acids are transported across the ileal enterocyte brush border membrane by the well characterized apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt) Slc10a2; however, the carrier(s) responsible for transporting bile acids across the ileocyte basolateral membrane into the portal circulation have not been fully identified.

These results demonstrate that the mouse Ostα-Ostβ heteromeric transporter is a basolateral bile acid carrier and may be responsible for bile acid efflux in ileum and other ASBT-expressing tissues. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and secreted into the small intestine where they facilitate the absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. The majority of bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestine, returned to the liver via the portal venous circulation, and resecreted into bile (1Shneider B.L. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2001; 32: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The major mechanism for intestinal absorption is active transport by the well characterized ileal apical sodium bile acid co-transporter (ASBT, 1The abbreviations used are: ASBT, apical sodium bile acid transporter; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; Ibabp, ileal bile acid binding protein; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; Mrp, multidrug resistance-associated protein; Ost, organic solute transporter; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. gene name Slc10a2) (3Dawson P.A.

Loss-of-function mutations in the human ASBT gene are associated with intestinal bile acid malabsorption (2Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and targeted deletion of the ASBT gene eliminates enterohepatic cycling of bile acids in mice (3Dawson P.A. Haywood J. Craddock A.L.

Following their ASBT-mediated transport across the apical brush border membrane, bile acids are shuttled to the basolateral membrane and secreted into the portal circulation. In contrast to apical transport, there is limited information regarding the ileal basolateral bile acid transporter. Using rat ileal basolateral membrane vesicles, bile acid transport was trans-stimulated by sulfate, bicarbonate ions, and p-aminohippurate, suggesting a sodium-independent anion exchange mechanism (4Weinberg S.L. Burckhardt G. Wilson F.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 44-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent affinity labeling using tritiated bile acid photoprobes and subcellular fractionation studies implicated a 54-kDa protein enriched in the basolateral membrane (5Lin M.C. Weinberg S.L. Kramer W. Burckhardt G. Wilson F.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 106: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Lin M.C. Kramer W. Wilson F.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1993; 265: G56-G62PubMed Google Scholar); however no specific transporter was identified. Possible mechanisms for basolateral bile acid transport include a dedicated transporter, multiple transporters with broad substrate specificity that includes bile acids, or a combination of both systems. Considering the high flux of bile acids across the ileal enterocyte (1Shneider B.L. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2001; 32: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it is likely that a dedicated basolateral bile acid transporter is required. More recently, additional candidate ileal basolateral bile acid transporters have been proposed, including t-Asbt (8Lazaridis K.N. Tietz P. Wu T. Kip S. Dawson P.A. LaRusso N.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11092-11097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (Mrp3, gene name Abcc3) (9Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Takikawa H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2905-2910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Zeng H. Liu G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4779-4784PubMed Google Scholar). However, their specific roles are uncertain, and the identity of the basolateral bile acid transporter remains a missing link in our understanding of the enterohepatic circulation. In this study, transcriptional profiling in Slc10a2 null mice was used to identify a novel candidate ileal basolateral bile acid transporter. Materials—[3H]Taurocholic acid (2.0–3.0 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Inulin [14C]carboxylic acid (2–10 mCi/mmol) and [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. HEK293 (CRL-1573) and MDCK (CCL-34) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in monolayer at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were maintained in medium A consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4,500 mg/liter d-glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. MDCK cells were maintained in medium B consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1000 mg/liter d-glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. Animals—All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed in plastic cages in a temperature-controlled room (22 °C) with 12-h light cycling. Animals were fed ad libitum a cereal-based rodent chow diet (Purina). The Slc10a2 null mice have been described previously (3Dawson P.A. Haywood J. Craddock A.L. Wilson M. Tietjen M. Kluckman K. Maeda N. Parks J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33920-33927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). RNA Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) as suggested by the manufacturer. For Northern blot analysis of mouse gastrointestinal tissues, total RNA from pools of animals of the same sex and genotype was fractionated on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to Nytran (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell). For analysis of other mouse tissues, a multitissue Northern blot (FirstChoice Mouse blot 1) containing 2 μg of poly(A) RNA/lane from mixed sex, 8–10-week-old Swiss Webster mice was obtained from Ambion. The blots were hybridized with the indicated 32P-labeled random hexamer-primed DNA probes, and expression levels were quantified using a 445SI phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics). For real-time PCR analysis, cDNA synthesis was initiated from 1 μg of RNA using random hexamer primers and Omniscript transcription reagents (Qiagen). For each real-time PCR reaction, cDNA synthesized from 25 ng of RNA was mixed with 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) containing 500 nm specific primers. The PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate, and the samples were analyzed on an ABI 7900 sequence detection system. The oligonucleotide primer sequences used in these experiments were: mouse Asbt, 5′-TGGGTTTCTTCCTGGCTAGACT-3′ and 5′-TGTTCTGCATTCCAGTTTCCAA-3′; mouse Ostα, 5′-TACAAGAACACCCTTTGCCC-3′ and 5′-CGAGGAATCCAGAGACCAAA-3′; mouse Ostβ, 5′-GTATTTTCGTGCAGAAGATGCG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTGTTTGCCAGGATGCTC-3′; mouse GAPDH, 5′-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGAT-3′. Analysis of Protein Expression—Synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 315–329 of mouse Ostα, MYYRRKDDKVGYEAC, and 91–104 of mouse Ostβ, FLRETLISEKPDLA(C), were synthesized, coupled via their carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (11Adrian T.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 73: 239-249PubMed Google Scholar) and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits (AnaSpec, Inc.). The polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Asbt antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 335–348 of the mouse Asbt and has been described previously (12Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabbit anti-human ASBT antibody was raised against the carboxyl-terminal 39 amino acids of human ASBT that was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase-ASBT fusion protein. This antibody has been used previously to measure ASBT protein expression in human ileal biopsies (13Jung D. Fantin A.C. Scheurer U. Fried M. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Gut. 2004; 53: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal (catalog number F3165), anti-Myc (catalog number M5546), and anti-β-actin (catalog number A5441) antibodies were obtained from Sigma. For immunoblotting analysis of tissue extracts, intestinal segments were homogenized on ice in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.6) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After tissue fragments and nuclei were pelleted at 2500 × g, membranes were pelleted at 20,500 × g, resuspended in homogenization buffer, aliquoted, and stored at -70 °C. For immunoblotting analysis of transfected cell extracts, the cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors. The cells were pelleted at 10,000 × g at 4 °C and stored at -70 °C. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cell pellets in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm EDTA) by repeated aspiration through a 25-gauge needle. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and aliquots of cell supernatants were stored at -70 °C. Samples were diluted into buffer A (15% SDS, 8 m urea, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at pH 6.8), heated at 37 °C for 30 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dried milk, dissolved in blotting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (NTBS). Membranes were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody, washed in NTBS containing nonfat dry milk, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The following dilutions of antibodies were used: anti-Ostα or anti-Ostβ, 1:500; anti-Asbt, 1:500; anti-FLAG, 1:1000; anti-Myc, 1:1000, anti-β-actin, 1:10,000; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, 1:5,000; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, 1:10,000. Antibody binding was then detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences). For endoglycosidase H (Endo H) digestion, aliquots of tissue or cell extracts were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1.25 × 103 units of Endo H (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.5% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. For peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion, aliquots of tissue or cell extracts were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1.25 × 103 units of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were then brought to 7.5% SDS, 4 m urea, 5% (w/v) sucrose, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, heated for 1 h at 37 °C, and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the blots were blocked and incubated with antibody as described above. Immunolocalization (Tissue)—Mouse intestinal tissue was mounted in OCT compound (Ted Pella, Inc.), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Sections (6 μm) of mouse intestine were air-dried for 2 h, fixed in freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS, washed in PBS, and stored at 4 °C. The sections were then incubated in blocking solution (PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% fetal calf serum) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were fixed with freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated in blocking solution (PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at room temperature. The tissue sections or cells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of anti-Ostα, Ostβ, or Asbt antibody in blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with 25 μg/ml of rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in blocking solution for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the sections were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. Following fixation, the samples were washed three times in PBS, and nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Following an additional two washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted with Vectashield HardSet mounting media (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss laser scanning 510 confocal microscope equipped with a fluorescein (band pass 505–530)/rhodamine (band pass 565–615)/far red (long pass 650) filter set. For each experiment, a section or dish was incubated with the secondary antibody alone to determine background fluorescence. Construction of Mouse Ostα and Ostβ Expression Plasmids—A mouse Ostα expression plasmid was constructed as follows. Mouse I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone 5041102 encoding 143 nucleotides of 5′ untranslated region, the full-length 1023 nucleotide coding region, and a 205 nucleotide 3′ untranslated region was obtained from Invitrogen, and the entire cDNA insert was sequenced. A PCR-based strategy using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was employed to append the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) to the carboxyl terminus of mouse Ostα. The carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged Ostα was then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) plasmid (Invitrogen). The mouse Ostβ clone has been described previously (14Seward D.J. Koh A.S. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27473-27482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A PCR-based strategy using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was employed to append a Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) to the carboxyl terminus of mouse Ostβ. The carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged Ostβ was then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) plasmid. To co-express both Ost subunits, the epitope-tagged Ostα and Ostβ cDNA inserts were sequentially cloned into the 5′ and 3′ multicloning site cassettes, respectively, of pIRES (Clontech). In pIRES, an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) mediates translational initiation from the 3′ cassette and a cytomegalovirus promoter drives expression of the bicistronic transcript. The entire expression cassette, including the epitope-tagged mouse Ostα and Ostβ cDNA inserts was removed from pIRES and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) to generate a hygromycin-resistant plasmid expressing both Ost subunits. All cDNA inserts were sequenced using a PerkinElmer ABI Prism 377 sequencer. Unless otherwise indicated, the cell transfection experiments were performed using the epitope-tagged Ostα and Ostβ constructs. Expression in Transiently Transfected HEK293 Cells—On day 0, 35-mm plates of HEK293 cells were seeded with 7.6 × 105 cells/plate. On day 1, each plate was transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). On day 2, the cells were incubated at 37 °C with the indicated concentration of [3H]taurocholate in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 137 mm Na+ for 10–30 min. The cells were washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution and harvested to determine cell-associated radioactivity and protein, as described previously (15Craddock A.L. Love M.W. Daniel R.W. Kirby L.C. Walters H.C. Wong M.H. Dawson P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G157-G169PubMed Google Scholar). Transport Assays in Stably Transfected MDCK Cells—The human ASBT stably transfected MDCK cells have been described previously (16Walters H.C. Craddock A.L. Fusegawa H. Willingham M.C. Dawson P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1188-G1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human ASBT and mouse Ostα-Ostβ subunits were stably expressed in MDCK cells as follows. On day 0, 100-mm plates were seeded with 1.5 × 106 MDCK-ASBT cells. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 6 μg of the mouse Ostα, Ostβ, or OstαIRESOstβ expression plasmids using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. On day 3, the cells were trypsinized and reseeded at 4.6 × 105 cells/plate in medium containing 350 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) and 300 μg/ml of hygromycin (Invitrogen). After selection for 19–21 days, ∼75 individual colonies were picked for each plasmid construct transfected, expanded in 35-mm plates, and screened by immunoblotting for Ostα and Ostβ protein expression. For bile acid uptake and trans-cellular transport assays, stably transfected MDCK-ASBT, MDCK-ASBT/Ostα, MDCK-ASBT/Ostβ, or MDCK-ASBT/OstαIRESOstβ were plated on 24-well plates or 12-mm Transwell filter inserts (Costar) at 3 × 105 cells/well or insert. The medium in the basolateral and apical chambers was changed every 2–3 days. Formation of a tight seal between the apical and basolateral chambers was monitored by trans-epithelial transport of inulin [14C]carboxylic acid (∼50 μm). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the diffusion of radiolabeled inulin across the cell monolayer from the apical and basolateral chambers was <1.1 and <0.2%, respectively. Following formation of the tight monolayer (typically between days 6 and 10), the cells were refed medium B containing 10 mm sodium butyrate to induce expression of the transfected genes (16Walters H.C. Craddock A.L. Fusegawa H. Willingham M.C. Dawson P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1188-G1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 20 h later, the cell monolayers were washed and incubated at 37 °C for 10–60 min with Hanks' buffered saline solution plus 10 μm [3H]taurocholate added to the apical or basolateral chambers. Trans-cellular transport was monitored by sampling the contra-lateral chamber. After incubation, the cells were washed in ice-cold Hanks' buffered saline solution and harvested to determine cell-associated radioactivity and protein. Statistical Analyses—Mean values ± S.D. are shown in Figs. 5, 7, and 8. The data were evaluated for statistically significant differences using the two-tailed Student's t test, assuming equal variance (Statview). Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.Fig. 7Bile acid uptake activity in stably transfected MDCK cells. On day 0, MDCK cells stably transfected with the indicated plasmids were seeded onto 24-well plates. On day 2, expression of the transfected plasmids was induced by the addition of 10 mm sodium butyrate. After 20 h, the cell monolayers were washed and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm [3H]taurocholate either in the presence of 137 mm Na+ (A) or K+ (B). The cells were then washed and processed to determine cell-associated protein and radioactivity. Uptake values (mean ± S.D.) are expressed as pmol of taurocholate/mg of cell protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 8Trans-cellular transport of taurocholate in stably transfected MDCK cells. MDCK cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were plated onto Transwell filter inserts on day 0. Expression of the transfected plasmids was induced by the addition of 10 mm sodium butyrate on day 7. On day 8, either the apical or the basolateral Transwell chamber received 10 μm [3H]taurocholate, and aliquots of media in the opposite chamber were sampled over 60 min. Data for the apical to basolateral transport are shown in the line graph. Data for basolateral to apical transport after 60 min are shown in the inset. Values are means ± S.D., n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of Transporter Gene Expression in Slc10a2-/- Mice—In an attempt to identify candidate basolateral bile acid transporters, the mRNA expression for a group of 180 known and orphan solute transporters was measured in the ileum, colon, and liver tissue of wild type and Slc10a2 null mice using real-time PCR. It was hypothesized that the basolateral bile acid transporter would be highly expressed in the ileum and positively regulated by bile acids. As such, its expression would be decreased in the ileum tissue of the Slc10a2 null mice in response to the decreased uptake of bile acids and possibly be induced in the cecum and colon tissue of these animals in response to the 10-fold increased flux of bile acids through their large intestine (3Dawson P.A.

One of the transporter genes that was significantly induced in the colon tissue of Slc10a2 null mice was the mouse ortholog of the organic solute transporter (Ost) α subunit. Wang et al. (17Wang W. Seward D.J. Li L. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) originally identified the Ost transporter complex (Ostα-Ostβ) from the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) using expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes (17Wang W. Seward D.J. Li L. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and this same laboratory subsequently cloned and expressed the human and mouse orthologs of the skate Ostα-Ostβ proteins (14Seward D.J.

Remarkably, solute transport requires the expression of two different subunits, a 340-amino acid polytopic membrane protein (Ostα) and a 128-amino acid single trans-membrane protein (Ostβ), and when co-expressed, these two proteins mediate the transport of bile acids and other sterols (14Seward D.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, human OSTα and OSTβ are expressed in relative abundance in tissues that also express the ASBT, namely the human small intestine, kidney, and liver (14Seward D.J. Koh A.S. Boyer J.L. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27473-27482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), suggesting that OSTα-OSTβ may be a basolateral bile acid exporter. To directly test this hypothesis, the present studies examined the tissue expression, protein localization, and functional activity of mouse Ostα-Ostβ. Northern blotting using mouse Ostα and Ostβ probes confirmed the real-time RT-PCR results obtained for Ostα and demonstrated that both Ostα and Ostβ mRNA was decreased in ileum and significantly induced in cecum and colon tissue of the Slc10a2 null mice (Fig. 1). The expression of Ibabp mRNA, which is positively regulated by bile acids via the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (18Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control for this study. Similar to Ostα and Ostβ, Ibabp expression was decreased in the distal small intestine (Fig. 1A) and induced in the cecum and colon tissue (data not shown) of the Slc10a2 null mice. The apparent positive regulation of Ostα-Ostβ by bile acids coupled with their high ileal expression and bile acid transport potential further supported a role for Ostα-Ostβ as an ileal basolateral bile acid transporter. Tissue Expression of Mouse Ostα and Ostβ—Northern blot analysis of multiple mouse tissues demonstrated single 1.5- and 0.8-kb transcripts for Ostα and Ostβ, respectively, in mouse kidney but not heart, brain, liver, spleen, embryo, lung, thymus, ovary, or testis (Fig. 2A). To examine the gastrointestinal expression of Ostα and Ostβ mRNA, Northern blot and real-time PCR analysis was performed using total RNA from mouse liver, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, proximal colon, and distal colon tissue. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, Ostα and Ostβ mRNA expression closely parallel one another. In addition, Ostα and Ostβ mRNA expression along the cephalocaudal axis was similar to that of the Asbt, with low levels in the proximal small intestine and the highest levels in the ileum. In contrast, Mrp3 mRNA expression was highest in the colon, liver, stomach, and proximal small intestine (Fig. 2B). Expression of Mrp4 mRNA, another candidate bile acid efflux pump (19Rius M. Nies A.T. Hummel-Eisenbeiss J. Jedlitschky G. Keppler D. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), was undetectable in intestine under these Northern blotting conditions. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that Mrp4 mRNA is expressed at only low levels in the small intestine (data not shown). To examine Ost protein expression, crude membranes were prepared from mouse small intestine and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, the anti-Ostα antibody detected a ∼40-kDa protein as well as a small amount of unresolved Ostα oligomer. Like the Asbt, Ostα protein was expressed primarily in mouse distal small intestine and at lower levels in proximal small intestine. Because the mouse Ostα sequence includes a potential N-linked glycosylation site, we also examined the glycosidase sensitivity of the mouse Ostα. As a positive control, Asbt was examined in the same glycosidase-treated mouse ileal membrane extracts. The mouse Asbt is a membrane glycoprotein with two N-linked carbohydrate chains (20Hallen S. Bjorquist A. Ostlund-Lindqvist A.M. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14916-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).

Here we show through structure-guided mutagenesis that TRPM2 gating by ADP-ribose and both oxidative and nitrosative stresses requires an intact ADP-ribose binding cleft in the C-terminal nudix domain.

Overall, our data are most consistent with a model of oxidative and nitrosative stress-induced TRPM2 activation in which mitochondria are induced to produce free ADP-ribose and release it to the cytosol, where its subsequent accumulation induces TRPM2 gating via interaction within a binding cleft in the C-terminal NUDT9-H domain of TRPM2.

Recently, the TRPM2 cation channel has been shown to undergo gating in response to oxidative or nitrosative stress occurring upon ROS or RNS exposure (13Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jungling E.

As TRPM2 is a novel dual function protein that possesses both ion channel and ADP-ribose hydrolase functions (15Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q.

Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), there has been great interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms through which oxidative and nitrosative stress activate TRPM2 channels, as well as the physiological role(s) of TRPM2-mediated ion fluxes and enzymatic activity in the context of cellular exposure to ROS and RNS. TRPM2 is classified as a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin-related (TRPM) ion channel family based on the homology of its ≈600 amino acid N-terminal domain and ≈300 amino acid channel-forming domain to corresponding regions of other TRPM family members. The enzymatic function of TRPM is encoded by a C-terminal domain, designated the NUDT9-homology (NUDT9-H) domain, which is homologous to the NUDT9 ADP-ribose hydrolase (15Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 17Perraud A.L.

In vitro studies of TRPM2 channel function using patch clamp techniques have suggested that ADP-ribose and NAD are both able to directly induce gating of full-length TRPM2 channels (14Hara Y.

Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and in vitro studies of the NUDT9-H domain demonstrate that it has a low level of ADP-ribose hydrolase activity and the apparent capacity to interact with NAD through its nudix hydrolase enzymatic motif (14Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol.

However, there is a significant gap in understanding how the in vitro data on TRPM2 function relate to oxidative/nitrosative stress-induced TRPM2 gating in intact cells. First, because of technical difficulties with adenine nucleotide extraction, very few direct measurements of ADP-ribose levels have been made. Consequently, little is known about the metabolism of free ADP-ribose (see Ref. 19Jacobson E.L. Cervantes-Laurean D. Jacobson M.K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), particularly whether ADP-ribose could accumulate to the high 10s of μm levels required to induce TRPM2 gating (15Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Second, although millimolar NAD concentrations have been shown to rapidly and reversibly induce TRPM2 gating in excised patch clamp studies, in whole cell patch clamp studies, NAD-induced TRPM2 activation takes much longer than either ADP-ribose-induced TRPM2 activation or the predicted time for diffusional equilibration of NAD with the cell interior (14Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 18Sano Y. Inamura K. Miyake A. Mochizuki S. Yokoi H. Matsushime H. Furuichi K. Science. 2001; 293: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), observations which are difficult to reconcile with direct NAD-induced gating in a cellular context. In addition, the use of high concentrations of NAD brings with it the possibility of sufficient contaminating ADP-ribose or intra-experimental NAD hydrolysis to ADP-ribose to induce TRPM2 gating, precluding a definitive interpretation of such experiments as favoring NAD-induced gating over ADP-ribose-induced gating. Third, a putative splice variant of TRPM2 has been reported that is able to gate in response to high concentrations of peroxide (5 mm) but not in response to either NAD or ADP-ribose in whole cell patch clamp studies (13Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jungling E. Zitt C. Luckhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), indicating that under some circumstances TRPM2 gating in response to H2O2 may occur in a ligand-independent manner, although a recent report indicates that gating of this channel by peroxide is not consistently observed (20Kuhn F.J. Luckhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46431-46437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In any case, the relevance of the behavior of this TRPM2 variant to full-length TRPM2 channels remains to be established. Because of the above issues, the molecular mechanisms through which oxidative/nitrosative stress induce TRPM2 gating in intact cells are presently controversial. Here, we have undertaken a combination of structural, pharmacological, and cell biological approaches to explore in greater depth the mechanism through which oxidative/nitrosative stresses induce the activation of full-length TRPM2 channels. The data derived from our studies are not easily reconciled with NAD-induced or direct/membrane delimited models for oxidative/nitrosative stress-induced activation of full-length TRPM2 channels. Instead, they suggest that oxidative/nitrosative stress activates a mitochondrial biochemical pathway, which results in the production of ADP-ribose within the mitochondria, with the ADP-ribose thus produced being released to the cytosol where it acts as a diffusible second messenger to induce TRPM2 gating. Structural Modeling—The structural model of the NUDT9-H was produced by threading the sequence of NUDT9-H on to the refined structure of NUDT9 at 1.8 Å using MODELLER6v2 (21Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The structure of the loop that replaces helix H5 in the NUDT9 structure was refined using the loop algorithm in the same program (22Fiser A. Sali A. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2500-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). A model of ADP-ribose was then docked into the NUDT9-H model followed by energy minimization using CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Chemicals—Cyclosporin A, 5[H]-phenanthridin-6-one, H2O2, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), ADP-ribose, and all other standard salts and buffers used to make calcium imaging and patch clamp solutions content were obtained from Sigma. GPI-16539 was synthesized and purified as described previously (24Ferraris D. Ko Y.S. Pahutski T. Ficco R.P. Serdyuk L. Alemu C. Bradford C. Chiou T. Hoover R. Huang S. Lautar S. Liang S. Lin Q.

Molecular Biology—A WT TRPM2 cDNA and TRPM2-expressing HEK-293 cells have been described previously (15Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). For generation of constitutive TRPM2-expressing HEK-293 cells, a TRPM2 expression construct with a glycine for serine substitution at position 1367 was placed into the pApuro plasmid with a modified cloning site to provide an N-terminal hemagglutinin-tag, with expression driven by the chicken β actin promotor, and was transfected into HEK-293 cells expressing the tetracycline suppressor under control of a CMV promotor. Single clones with various levels of TRPM2-dependent currents were grown out under puromycin selection. Clones with the highest level of TRPM2 expression (∼10 nA of current elicited by 100 μm ADP-ribose under unbuffered calcium conditions) were then retransfected with various NUDT9 constructs under control of the pCDNA4/T0 plasmid and clones with inducible expression were selected under zeocin selection. The TRPM2(S1367G) channel behaved identically to WT TRPM2 channels in terms of both ADP-ribose induced gating by patch clamp and induction of fura-2 transient in response to ROS and RNS. Cytosolic NUDT9 and mitochondrial-targeted NUDT9 constructs have been described previously (17Perraud A.L. Shen B. Dunn C.A. Rippe K. Smith M.K. Bessman M.J. Stoddard B.L. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1794-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Clones lacking detectable expression in the absence of doxycycline and with the highest level of doxycycline-induced expression were chosen for further analysis. TRPM2 mutants were constructed by introducing a KpnI restriction site into our wild type TRPM2 sequence after position 1197, causing the amino acids sequence to change from... QTARALHWIVRTLRASGFSSEADVP... to... QTARALHWIVRGTTLRASGFSSEADVP... TRPM2 channels containing the introduced GT amino acids followed by the wild type NUDT9-H domain (without the S1367G substitution) behaved identically to wild type TRPM2 channels (data not shown). Point mutations were then made in the isolated NUDT9-H domain and spliced onto the rest of the TRPM2 sequence by subcloning using the KpnI site. The predicted amino acids sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. NUDT9 mutants were produced using QuikChange to introduce mutations into the indicated residues as described previously (17Perraud A.L. Shen B. Dunn C.A. Rippe K. Smith M.K. Bessman M.J. Stoddard B.L. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1794-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Using stable HEK cell lines with doxycycline-inducible expression of the indicated channels, 10-7 cells were induced and plated for 48 h under conditions identical to those utilized for imaging and patch clamp experiments. The cells were then harvested, and surface-labeled with biotin. After inactivation of residual biotinylation reagent, the cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and analyzed by Western blotting, first with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase immunoblotting to detect surface expressed protein, followed by a stripping of the membrane and anti-FLAG immunoblotting to detect total expressed protein using standard luminal-based techniques. Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells transfected with the FLAG-human TRPM2/pCDNA4/TO construct were grown on glass coverslips with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, blasticidin (5 μg/ml), and zeocin (0.4 mg/ml) for 48 h prior to imaging and patch clamp experiments. TRPM2 expression was induced by adding 1 μg/ml doxycycline to the culture medium. Stable TRPM2 cells with inducible NUDT9 expression were grown in culture, and NUDT9 expression was induced in a manner identical to that used for the inducible TRPM2 cell lines. Calcium Imaging—Changes in cytosolic calcium were monitored using changes in fura-2 fluorescence measured using a TILL Photonics imaging system IV and otherwise standard methods. Briefly, cells were plated on 25 mm circular coverslips 48 h prior to analysis and either left untreated or treated with 1 μg/ml of doxycycline. The coverslips were then placed at room temperature in a microscope chamber and imaged by exposure every 2 or 5 s to 340/380 nm excitation accompanied by monitoring 510 nm emission light for the period of time indicated in each panel. The indicated stimuli were added to the chamber manually at the time indicated in the panels. Bath solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. It is likely that other cation channels may contribute a portion of calcium entering in response to exposure of intact cells to larger concentrations of ROS and that this may contribute to the small calcium transients occurring in the absence of TRPM2. Therefore, whenever appropriate, we attempted to choose conditions such that any calcium entering through such other channels was either minimized or insufficient to induce an alteration in cytosolic calcium concentration (e.g. the use 100 μm H2O2, or the use of 100 μm MNNG, each of which generally produced only a small alteration or no significant alteration of cytosolic calcium in cells lacking TRPM2 expression, see Fig. 1). A higher concentration of H2O2 was used to generate maximal calcium responses in all TRPM2 mutant-expressing cell lines and was also used to help evaluate whether a general antioxidant effect of a pharmacological treatment could be contributing to the observed inhibition of the TRPM2-dependent component of a response. Note that although 1 mm or higher concentrations of H2O2 induced significant cell toxicity in the absence of TRPM2, treatment of cells with 100 μm H2O2 produced little apparent toxicity even after 24 h of exposure (data not shown). Patch Clamp—Whole cell patch clamp experiments were performed at 21-25 °C 18-24 h post-induction, using cells grown on glass coverslips and kept in a standard modified Ringer's solution of the following composition, NaCl 145 mm, KCl 2.8 mm, CsCl 10 mm, CaCl2 1 mm, MgCl2 2 mm, glucose 10 mm, and Hepes·NaOH 10 mm, pH 7.2. Intracellular pipette-filling solutions contained Cs-glutamate 145 mm, NaCl 8 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, Cs-EGTA 10 mm, pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH, or Cs-glutamate 145 mm, NaCl 8 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH. The amount of ADP-ribose included in the patch pipette is indicated in the legend associated with each patch clamp experiment figure. High-resolution current recordings were acquired by a computer-based patch clamp amplifier system (EPC-9, HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Immediately following establishment of the whole cell configuration, voltage ramps of 50-ms duration spanning the voltage range of -100 to +100 mV were delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV at a rate of 0.5 Hz over a period of 200-400 s. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of 10 mV between external and internal solutions when internal solutions contained glutamate. Currents were filtered at 2.3 kHz and digitized at 100-μs intervals. Capacitative currents and series resistance were determined and corrected before each voltage ramp using the automatic capacitance compensation of the EPC-9. The low-resolution temporal development of currents at a given potential was extracted from individual ramp current records by measuring the current amplitudes at voltages of -80 or +80 mV. Each inducible cell line was evaluated in the presence and absence of doxycycline induction. In the absence of doxycycline induction, in no case were significant TRPM2-like currents ever observed, e.g. baseline currents in untransfected HEK-293 cells at -80 mV were at most 5-10 pA inward, and at +80 mV, 10-15 pA outward and baseline currents in all transfected cell lines were not distinguishable from those in the untransfected cells. This would place an upper limit of 1-2 channels on the number of surface-expressed TRPM2 channels in uninduced cells. Under the recording conditions used, we observed no significant evolution of other cation currents known to be present in HEK-293 cells, including TRPM7-like currents (data not shown). In the course of investigations of the effects of various types of oxidative/nitrosative stress on TRPM2 gating, we noted that TRPM2-dependent calcium transients are activated in response to cellular exposure to a variety of forms of ROS and RNS (Fig. 1), including exposure to MNNG, which in addition to inducing nitrosative stress has been shown to produce markedly diminished NAD levels in HEK cells over a time course in which we observed sustained TRPM2 gating (25Yu S.W.

Furthermore, disulfide stress induced by the disulfide-inducing reagent diamide did not initiate TRPM2-dependent calcium transients (data not shown), indicating that the pathway leading to TRPM2 activation most likely involves oxidative/nitrosative modification of one or more protein thiol group(s) (2Dickinson D.A.

These observations are difficult to reconcile with a proposed model of TRPM2 activation involving accumulation of NAD because of generalized adenine nucleotide oxidation and its agonistic binding to the NUDT9-H domain (14Hara Y. Wakamori M. Ishii M. Maeno E. Nishida M. Yoshida T. Yamada H. Shimizu S. Mori E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Kurose H. Okada Y. Imoto K. Mori Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), and suggested to us that oxidative/nitrosative stress-mediated TRPM2 activation must involve an alternative mechanism. As an initial step toward obtaining insight into potential alternative TRPM2 gating mechanisms, we focused on obtaining an improved understanding of NUDT9-H domain interactions with NAD and ADP-ribose by using the NUDT9 crystal structure to construct a structural model of the NUDT9-H domain of TRPM2 (Fig. 2A, alignment of NUDT9 and NUDT9-H sequences is shown). As illustrated in Fig. 2B, this model possesses an apparent binding cleft similar to that previously identified in NUDT9 (28Shen B.W. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Docking of ADP-ribose into this binding cleft results in a predicted mode of binding very similar to that of ADP-ribose with NUDT9, with conservation of three residues in closest proximity to ADP-ribose, Asp1431 and His1488 (corresponding to Asp271 and His324 of NUDT9) interacting with the ribose ring and Asn1345 (corresponding to Asn168 of NUDT9) interacting with the adenine ring (28Shen B.W. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). An important prediction of this model is that the non-nucleoside ribose ring of ADP-ribose binds into a pocket that is incapable of accommodating an additional bulky nicotinamide group, as would be required for NAD to bind the NUDT9-H in a manner similar to ADP-ribose (Fig. 2B). This prediction is supported by our previous observation that the NUDT9-H has a small amount of hydrolase activity toward ADP-ribose but not NAD, consistent with the former but not the latter having access to the NUDT9-H binding cleft/active site (15Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C. Stokes A.J. Zhu Q. Bessman M.J. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). This prediction also has the important implication that neither direct binding nor agonistic activation of TRPM2 by NAD would be likely to occur through an interaction within the binding cleft identified in our model. To experimentally assess whether the predicted NUDT9-H binding cleft has a requisite role in either ADP-ribose-induced or oxidative/nitrosative stress-induced TRPM2 gating, we used the NUDT9-H structural model to identify residues within the predicted binding cleft, which would not be likely to affect global NUDT9-H folding or expression, but which could potentially influence the function of the NUDT9-H domain. Of the three residues in closest contact with the docked ADP-ribose (Asn1345, His1488, and Asp1431), all were within conserved secondary structures (β sheet B7, helix H7, and the highly conserved and deeply buried L5 loop, respectively (Fig. 3A, see also Ref. 28Shen B.W. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), likely to be important for NUDT9-H folding or stability and were therefore projected as poor candidates for mutagenesis. Consequently, we focused on introducing mutations into nudix motif residues within the binding cleft, which our homology model suggested would not contribute interactions likely to be required for folding or stability of the overall NUDT9-H domain (Fig. 3A, residues enclosed in red oval (28Shen B.W. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)). Six TRPM2 constructs with individual or selected combinations of amino acid changes in the nudix motif were transfected under control of a doxycycline-controlled promotor into HEK-293 cells, and stable cell lines with inducible protein expression were isolated. The resulting cell lines were induced with doxycycline and analyzed for their capacity to support an enhanced H2O2-mediated calcium transient using fura-2 imaging, and for the presence of ADP-ribose-dependent currents by whole cell patch clamp (Fig. 3B, left plots show calcium transients; right plots show ADP-ribose-dependent current evolution; point mutant channels that did not produce ADP-ribose-dependent currents or a calcium transient were analyzed biochemically for surface expression, in C). Two important observations emerged from these experiments. First, enzymatic activity of the NUDT9-H is apparently not required for channel gating, as the TRPM2 RILRKK mutant, which possesses mutations in two nudix motif residues absolutely required for NUDT9 enzymatic activity (17Perraud A.L. Shen B. Dunn C.A. Rippe K. Smith M.K. Bessman M.J. Stoddard B.L. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1794-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), is able to support both ADP-ribose-dependent channel gating and H2O2-induced calcium transients. Second, although idiosyncratic effects of a mutational approach cannot be excluded, TRPM2 channel gating via either ADP-ribose or oxidant stress exposure appears to occur through a common mechanism linked to the NUDT9-H binding cleft, as two mutant point channels (QILRQE and REFREE mutants) that lost the capacity for ADP-ribose-induced gating also lost the capacity for oxidant-induced gating despite being appropriately surface-expressed (Fig. 3C). The observation that two point mutant TRPM2 channels had correlated behavior in terms of their gating responses to ADP-ribose and oxidative stress is in contrast to the initially reported behavior of a TRPM2 deletion mutant missing amino acids 1292-1325 (hereafter designated TRPM2-Δ(1292-1325)) (13Wehage E.

Despite the predicted destruction of its ADP-ribose binding cleft and resulting loss of capacity to gate in response to ADP-ribose, this mutant has been reported to retain the capacity to gate in response to 5 mm peroxide (13Wehage E.

https://openalex.org/W2055600689,"An abrupt climate warming of 5 to 10 °C during the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary thermal maximum (PETM) 55 Myr ago is linked to the catastrophic release of ∼1,050–2,100 Gt of carbon from sea-floor methane hydrate reservoirs1. Although atmospheric methane, and the carbon dioxide derived from its oxidation, probably contributed to PETM warming, neither the magnitude nor the timing of the climate change is consistent with direct greenhouse forcing by the carbon derived from methane hydrate. Here we demonstrate significant differences between marine2,3 and terrestrial4,5,6 carbon isotope records spanning the PETM. We use models of key carbon cycle processes7,8,9 to identify the cause of these differences. Our results provide evidence for a previously unrecognized discrete shift in the state of the climate system during the PETM, characterized by large increases in mid-latitude tropospheric humidity and enhanced cycling of carbon through terrestrial ecosystems. A more humid atmosphere helps to explain PETM temperatures, but the ultimate mechanisms underlying the shift remain unknown."

Previous studies demonstrated sialic acid-dependent binding of Siglec-8 but failed to reveal significant substructure specificity or high affinity of that binding. To test a broader range of potential ligands, a Siglec-8-Ig chimeric protein was tested for binding to 172 different glycan structures immobilized as biotinylated glycosides on a 384-well streptavidin-coated plate. Of these, ∼40 structures were sialylated. Among these, avid binding was detected to a single defined glycan, NeuAcα2–3(6-O-sulfo)Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3]GlcNAc, also referred to in the literature as 6′-sulfo-sLex. Notably, neither unsulfated sLex (NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3]GlcNAc) nor an isomer with the sulfate on the 6-position of the GlcNAc residue (6-sulfo-sLex, NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3](6-O-sulfo)GlcNAc) supported detectable binding. Subsequent secondary screening was performed using surface plasmon resonance. Biotin glycosides immobilized on streptavidin biosensor chips were exposed to Siglec-8-Ig in solution.

Subsequent exposure to Siglec-8-Ig precomplexed with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-human Fc resulted in fluorescent signals at immobilized concentrations of 6′-sulfo-sLex of <5 pmol/spot. In contrast, sLex and 6-sulfo-sLex did not support any Siglec-8 binding at the highest concentration tested (300 pmol/spot).

In addition, Siglec cytoplasmic domains typically contain multiple tyrosine residues, including some with consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (1Crocker P.R. Varki A.

The highest levels of homology are found between Siglec-8 and Siglec-3 (49%), Siglec-5 (42%), and Siglec-7 (68%), with virtually all of the homology due to similarities in the extracellular and transmembrane regions. Subsequently, a splice variant of Siglec-8, termed Siglec-8L, which contains an identical extracellular domain but a longer cytoplasmic tail possessing two tyrosine-based motifs, was discovered from human genomic DNA (16Foussias G.

Additional experiments using monoclonal antibodies revealed that Siglec-8 is expressed not only on the surface of eosinophils but also on basophils and mast cells (14Kikly K.K. Bochner B.S.

In a more comprehensive evaluation of binding specificities, 10 Siglec-Ig chimeras were screened for binding to 28 different sialoside-streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase probes, and a wide range of binding patterns were observed, but there was no clear binding preference for Siglec-8 (29Blixt O. van den Collins B.E.

The Consortium for Functional Glycomics was funded as a large research initiative by the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences to facilitate research efforts focused on improving the understanding of the mechanisms by which glycan-binding proteins mediate cell communication. The Consortium is integrating the efforts of several scientific cores and participating investigators to achieve these aims. Among several cores is the protein-carbohydrate interaction core H and carbohydrate synthesis protein expression core D. These cores have developed a high throughput screening platform for identifying glycan-binding protein-ligand interactions using a streptavidin/biotin-based glycan array containing ∼180 different glycan structures immobilized as biotinylated glycosides on a 384-well streptavidin-coated plate. This was developed as an expansion of previous efforts (29Blixt O. van den Collins B.E. Nieuwenhof I.M. Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol.

A secondary analysis method was also used to quantitate the relative binding affinities of candidate ligands by surface plasmon resonance. Here we report that these and other approaches have been used to determine that Siglec-8 is a highly specific lectin, binding preferentially to the sLex structure bearing an additional sulfate ester on the galactose 6-hydroxyl, namely NeuAcα2–3(6-O-sulfo)Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3]GlcNAc, also referred to in the literature as 6′-sulfo-sLex, which is a structure closely related to 6-sulfo-sLex, a candidate ligand for l-selectin. Siglec-8-Ig Chimera—The extracellular domain of Siglec-8 was inserted in-frame with a Factor Xa cleavage site and the Fc portion of human IgG1, expanded in electroporated CHOEA1 cells, and then purified from supernatants (final concentration, 2.4 mg/ml) using protein A-Sepharose as described previously (14Kikly K.K.

Bovina N.V. Bioorg. Khim. 1992; 18: 283-298PubMed Google Scholar) were coated in replicates of n = 3 on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates (Pierce Reacti-Bind™ NeutrAvidin™ coated high-binding capacity black 384-well plates, product number 15513). Each well was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 pmol/well of glycoside in 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. The plates were washed three times with 100 μl of PBS using an automated plate washer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and stored sealed at 4 °C in 25 μl/well PBS with 0.1% azide until use. Prior to assay, the plates were washed three times with 100 μl/well wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20). A stock solution of Siglec-8-Ig (30 μg/ml) was added to each well in 25 μl of binding buffer (wash buffer plus 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were washed three times with 100 μl/well wash buffer and incubated for 1 h with 25 μl/well goat anti-human IgG-Alexa 488 (catalogue number A11013, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 5 μg/ml in binding buffer. The plates were washed and read in 25 μl of wash buffer on a Victor 2™ 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at excitation 485/emission 535. The glycosides probed are listed in Fig. S1 of the supplemental materials. Measurement of Siglec-8-Ig Binding Affinity Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—All surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Biotinylated glycosides were captured on research grade streptavidin-coated sensor chips (Sensor Chip SA, Biacore Inc.) that were pretreated according to the manufacturer's instructions. A solution of each biotinylated glycoside (10 fmol/μl) was injected at 2 μl/min in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% Tween 20 (running buffer) for varying lengths of time (3–7 min) until an optimal amount of glycan was captured on each independent surface. Three related glycosides were studied using one streptavidin sensor chip. A control (non-binding) glycan, LacNAc (Galβ1–4GlcNAc), was also captured on the same sensor chip, and the specific binding of Siglec-8-Ig for the test glycans was measured using the in-line reference subtraction feature of the Biacore 3000 instrument. Increasing concentrations of Siglec-8-Ig (0.1–18 μm) were injected at a flow rate of 60 μl/min over all four surfaces of the sensor chip. Bound Siglec-8-Ig was found to elute with normal buffer flow after the injection was complete. The equilibrium binding data of Siglec-8-Ig were analyzed by non-linear curve fitting using the BIAevaluation software (Biacore Inc.). Binding of Siglec-8-Ig to Aminoalkyl Glycosides Immobilized on Activated (N-hydroxysuccinimidyl) Glass Surfaces—The N-succinimidyl-activated glass slides (kindly provided by Schott-North America, Duryea, PA) were found to be compatible with the consortium library by coupling amino-terminated glycans and are currently being evaluated for a printed version of the consortium glycan array. A description of the printing and evaluation of the full array in this format has just been published elsewhere. 2Blixt, O., Head, S., Mondala, T., Scanlan, C., Huflejt, M. E., Alvarez, R., Bryan, M.

Aminopropyl glycosides were prepared as described previously (29Blixt O. van den Collins B.E. Nieuwenhof I.M. Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol.

Chiang C.K. Trayer I.P. Hill R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 34: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Aminoalkyl glycosides were covalently immobilized on N-succinimidyl-activated glass (Schott-Nexterion Slide H) using the manufacturer's protocols. All procedures were performed at ambient temperature. Briefly, each aminoalkyl glycoside was prepared at a series of concentrations ranging from 0.5 μm to 1 mm in 300 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 0.005% Tween 20 (spotting buffer). Drops (∼0.3 μl) of each glycan at each concentration were hand-spotted in quadruplicate on the slide surface in a humid chamber. After spotting, the slide was maintained for an additional hour in the humid chamber and then transferred to a desiccated chamber for 16 h. The slide was then immersed in 50 mm ethanolamine, 50 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, for 1 h, rinsed with water, dried under a stream of microfiltered air, and stored desiccated. A solution of 100 μg/ml Siglec-8-Ig and 50 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow complexes to form. The glycan-derivatized slide was immersed in PBS containing 0.01% Tween, drained, and then overlaid with the Siglec-8-Ig-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody conjugate. After 2 h in a dark humid chamber, the slide was washed by successive immersion in PBS/0.01% Tween (three times) and water/0.01% Tween (twice). The slide was briefly rinsed with distilled water and dried under microfiltered air. An image of the bound fluorescence was obtaining using a microarray scanner (ScanArray Express, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The integrated spot intensities were determined using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Glycan Array Screening—Using the glycan array available through the Consortium for Functional Glycomics, experiments were initiated to identify compounds that selectively and specifically bind to Siglec-8. Using Siglec-8-Ig fusion protein, a panel of 172 carbohydrate-based structures (see Fig. S1 of the supplemental materials) was screened for specific Siglec-8 binding. As shown in Fig. 1, Siglec-8-Ig fusion protein had high affinity (12:1 signal-to-noise binding) for structure 181, also know as 6′-sulfo-sLex or NeuAcα2–3(6-O-Su)Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1-O(CH2)3NH-CO(CH2)5NH-biotin (Fig. 2). Of additional relevance was that closely related structures to 181, such as structure 182, also known as 6-sulfo-sLex NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)(6-O-Su)GlcNAcβ1-O(CH2)3NHCO(CH2)5NH-biotin, which only differs from structure 181 by the location of the 6-O-Su (Fig. 2), and structure 108, also known as sLex or NeuAcα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1-O(CH2)2NHCO(CH2)5NHCO(CH2)5NH-biotin, had minimally increased binding affinity (1.2:1 and 0.8:1 signal-to-noise binding, respectively) for Siglec-8. The spacer arm itself, -O(CH2)3NH-CO(CH2)5NH-biotin, found on many of the other non-binding structures, cannot explain the binding activity for Siglec-8. Taken together, this information demonstrates that the 6-position O-linked sulfate on galactose is key to the specificity and affinity of this structure for Siglec-8 (Fig. 2).Fig. 1Results from the Siglec-8-Ig glycan binding array analysis. A total of 172 glycans were screened for binding along with positive and negative controls, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Error bars represent mean ± S.D. replicate determinations from a single experiment.

LacNAc was captured on one surface of the sensor chip and used as negative control (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, Siglec-8 showed specific binding, with very fast association and dissociation profiles only to the ligand 181. The sensorgrams showed that upon injection of the Siglec, binding rapidly reached equilibrium in the first few seconds, and the bound Siglec fell off rapidly after the injection was stopped. The apparent Kd for binding of Siglec-8 to ligand 181 was between 2 and 2.5 μm (Fig. 4). Further Verification of the Glycan Array Results—Binding of Siglec-8-Ig precomplexed with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-human Fc to aminopropyl glycosides immobilized on activated (N-hydroxysuccinimidyl) glass surfaces was also used to further verify the specificity of 6′-sulfo-sLex as a Siglec-8 ligand. As shown in Fig. 5, fluorescent signals were detected at immobilized concentrations of 6′-sulfo-sLex as low as 5 pmol/spot. In contrast, sLex and 6-sulfo-sLex did not support any Siglec-8 binding at the highest concentration tested (300 pmol/spot). Using a glycan array assembled by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics, 172 structures were screened for their ability to bind to Siglec-8-Ig fusion protein. By far the greatest binding was seen with ligand 181, which is 6′-sulfo-sLex (Figs. 1 and 2). Specificity was subsequently verified using SPR and a separate assay using immobilized glycans (Figs. 3, 4, 5). These three separate methods confirmed the specificity to be 6′-sulfo-sLex and not closely related structures because Siglec-8-Ig fusion protein failed to bind to unsulfated sLex as well as the closely related structure 6-sulfo-sLex. In addition, the specificity of binding, with reasonably high affinity (Kd 2.3 μm) to only one of 172 ligands tested, suggests that 6′-sulfo-sLex is a strong candidate for being a Siglec-8 ligand. Because candidate ligands for most other Siglecs remain virtually unknown, it is difficult to compare the Kd value for 6′-sulfo-sLex-Siglec-8 binding (2.3 μm) with Kd values for other Siglec-ligand interactions. Perhaps the best comparisons are provided by Blixt et al. (29Blixt O. van den Collins B.E. Nieuwenhof I.M. Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31007-31019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), who tested a panel of 28 monovalent sialosides as inhibitors of Siglec binding. For the eight human Siglecs tested, the Ki of the best sialoside for each ranged from 120 to 4700 μm (average ∼2mm). A “potent” sialoside inhibitor of mouse Siglec-4 had a Ki of 0.3 μm. The only other structure in the glycan array to show binding to Siglec-8 above background was ligand 188, which is a mixture of biantennary N-glycans from Wehi-3 cell supernatants. It is not known whether this supernatant contains 6′-sulfo-sLex. Although the specificity of binding of 6′-sulfo-sLex for Siglec-8 versus other human Siglecs has not yet been explored, this is the first time this ligand has been suspected to bind to any of the Siglecs. The likely mouse ortholog for Siglec-8 is mSiglec-F (33Zhang J.Q. Biedermann B. Nitschke L. Crocker P.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but it is currently unknown whether 6′-sulfo-sLex is a ligand. However, additional experiments (data not shown) using an mSiglec-G-Ig fusion protein failed to show specific binding to 6′-sulfo-sLex, providing some degree of selectivity of binding for Siglec-8. Additionally, it remains to be determined what role various components of 6′-sulfo-sLex, such as fucose, play in binding. Finally, there are no known receptors for the structure, although initial studies suggested that 6′-sulfo-sLex might serve as an l-selectin ligand (34Tsuboi S. Isogai Y. Hada N. King J.K. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27213-27216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies found that 6-sulfo-sLex rather than 6′-sulfo-sLex is a preferred ligand (35Sanders W.J. Katsumoto T.R. Bertozzi C.R. Rosen S.D. Kiessling L.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Bowman K.G. Hemmerich S. Bhakta S. Singer M.S. Bistrup A. Rosen S.D. Bertozzi C.R. Chem.

Considering that the Siglec-8-Ig fusion protein is bivalent, the rapid nature of binding seen in Fig. 3 seems unexpected. Furthermore, because the reagent used for calculation of dissociation rates is bivalent, it is unclear whether the dissociation rate of Siglec-8 monomer, when expressed on the surface of a cell, would be similar or different. It is possible that the two binding sites on each arm of the chimera associate and dissociate from the glycan with the same binding parameters, but this remains unclear. Synthesis of 6′-sulfo-sLex requires the presence of specific sulfotransferases in the Golgi apparatus of cells. Based on the known family of human Golgi-associated sulfotransferases (39Hemmerich S. Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Bistrup A. Ruddle N.R. Rosen S.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Grunwell J.R. Bertozzi C.R.

Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), at least GST-1 (also known as keratin sulfate galactose 6-O sulfotransferase (KSGal6ST) and carbohydrate sulfotransferase 1 (CHST-1)), which is known to sulfate galactose residues linked to N-acetyl glucosamine, would likely be involved in the synthesis of 6′-sulfo-sLex (Fig. 2). These genes are located on chromosome 11p11.1–11.2, and studies report rather broad tissue distribution of CHST-1 (42Mazany K.D. Peng T. Watson C.E. Tabas I. Williams K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1407: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 43Li X. Tedder T.F. Genomics. 1999; 55: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although KSGal6ST reportedly is expressed predominantly in brain tissue and to a lesser degree in skeletal muscle (44Fukuta M. Inazawa J. Torii T. Tsuzuki K. Shimada E. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32321-32328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Methods such as immunohistochemistry would be useful in identifying tissue localization of 6′-sulfo-sLex expression, but to date, there are no antibody reagents that can distinguish 6′-sulfo-sLex from 6-sulfo-sLex (45Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M. Nakanishi H. Nakamura S. Ishida H. Kiso M. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11225-11233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Previous studies with monoclonal antibodies suggest that cross-linking of Siglec-8 induces apoptosis on cells that express Siglec-8, such as human eosinophils (20Nutku E. Aizawa H. Hudson S.A. Bochner B.S. Blood. 2003; 101: 5014-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), so it is tempting to speculate that expression of Siglec-8 ligand in the central nervous system may be a way to eliminate inflammatory cells that have infiltrated the central nervous system. In summary, a Siglec-8-Ig chimeric protein was screened for binding to 172 different glycan structures immobilized as biotinylated glycosides. Among these, avid binding was detected to a single defined glycan, NeuAcα2–3(6-O-sulfo)Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3]GlcNAc, also referred to in the literature as 6′-sulfo-sLex. The data presented herein also demonstrate the utility and ease by which the Consortium for Functional Glycomics protein-carbohydrate interaction core H can readily be used to determine selective attachment of lectins, in this case a Siglec, to carbohydrate ligands. This rapid screening technique provides an initial method to define carbohydrate ligands for a wide range of structures and should prove useful for many such applications.

Glucose deprivation (2–8 h) in the presence of ETCBs enhanced parameters indicative of oxidative stress (i.e. GSSG and steady-state levels of oxygen-centered radicals) as well as cytotoxicity. Glucose deprivation in the presence of AntA also significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and parameters indicative of oxidative stress in several different human cancer cell lines (PC-3, DU145, MDA-MB231, and HT-29). In addition, human osteosarcoma cells lacking functional mitochondrial electron transport chains (rho(0)) were resistant to glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in the presence of AntA. In the absence of ETCBs, aminotriazole-mediated inactivation of catalase in PC-3 cells demonstrated increases in intracellular steady-state levels of H2O2 during glucose deprivation. Finally, in the absence of ETCBs, overexpression of manganese containing superoxide dismutase and/or mitochondrial targeted catalase using adenoviral vectors significantly protected PC-3 cells from toxicity and oxidative stress induced by glucose deprivation with expression of both enzymes providing greater protection than was seen with either alone. Overall, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that mitochondrial O2⋅¯ and H2O2 significantly contribute to glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and metabolic oxidative stress in human cancer cells.

Oxidative stress results when the balance between steady-state levels of intracellular prooxidants exceeds cellular anti-oxidant capacity. Many cancer cells have low levels of several antioxidant enzymes (i.e. Mn-SOD 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; ETCB, electron transport chain blocker; Mn-SOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; CuZn-SOD, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase; AntA, antimycin A; Myx, myxothiazol; Rot, rotenone; DNP, dinitrophenol; AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide.1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; ETCB, electron transport chain blocker; Mn-SOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; CuZn-SOD, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase; AntA, antimycin A; Myx, myxothiazol; Rot, rotenone; DNP, dinitrophenol; AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CMV, cytomegalovirus; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide. and catalase) (1Oberley L.W.

It has also been suggested that cancer cells may exhibit defects in their mitochondrial electron transport chains that could lead to increased steady-state levels of prooxidants (i.e. superoxide and hydroperoxides) resulting from one-electron reduction of O2 leading to a condition of metabolic oxidative stress (3Spitz D.R.

Most cancer cells maintain a high glycolytic rate; a phenomenon first described over 70 years ago and known as the Warburg effect (4Warburg O. Science. 1956; 132: 309-314Crossref Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in energy production, glucose metabolism also leads to the formation of pyruvate and NADPH, both of which are believed to function in the cellular detoxification of hydroperoxides (5Nath K.A.

Biophys. 1994; 312: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Pyruvate reacts directly with hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides (H2O2 and ROOH, respectively), resulting in the deacetylation of pyruvate to acetic acid and reduction of the peroxides to H2O or ROH (5Nath K.A. Ngo E.O. Hebbel R.P. Croatt A.J. Zhau B. Nutter L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C227-C236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH provides electrons for the reduction of glutathione disulfide and oxidized thioredoxin, which is required for the efficient detoxification of H2O2 and ROOH by glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins (3Spitz D.R.

Lee Y.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Given these observations it is logical to hypothesize that cancer cells might increase glucose metabolism as a compensatory mechanism to protect against intracellular hydroperoxides generated from mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. Several studies have demonstrated glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in cancer cells, but the role of mitochondrial O2⋅¯ and H2O2 in this phenomenon has not been clearly demonstrated (3Spitz D.R. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Galoforo S.S. Lee Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 7Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Sim J.E.

We hypothesize that glucose deprivation in human cancer cells will result in a compromised ability to detoxify H2O2 derived from mitochondrial metabolism resulting in steady-state increases in hydroperoxides that contribute to glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial O2⋅¯ and H2O2 mediate glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in human cancer cells, three different approaches were utilized. First, the effect of ETCBs (known to increase O2⋅¯ and H2O2 production in isolated mitochondria) was determined in intact cells during glucose deprivation. Antimycin A was tested as a blocker of Complex III, myxothiazol was tested as a blocker of entry into Complex III, and rotenone was tested as a Complex I blocker (see Fig. 12). Second, rho(0) human cancer cells, deficient in functional mitochondrial electron transport chains, were utilized. Finally, adenovirus-mediated transduction of mitochondrially targeted catalase (MitCat) or Mn-SOD was utilized to overexpress enzymatic scavengers of H2O2 and O2⋅¯, respectively, in human tumor cells prior to glucose deprivation in the absence of ETCBs. The results of these experiments demonstrated that ETCBs dramatically enhanced glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and parameters indicative of oxidative stress in all human tumor cell lines tested. Furthermore, rho(0) cells were resistant to increases in cytotoxicity and parameters indicative of oxidative stress during treatment with glucose deprivation in the presence of ETCBs. Finally, steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species (particularly H2O2) were increased during glucose deprivation in the presence and absence of ETCBs and overexpression of MitCat and Mn-SOD protected PC-3 cells from glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and parameters indicative of oxidative stress in the absence of ETCBs. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that mitochondria represent a primary source of O2⋅¯ and H2O2 that significantly contributes to glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in human cancer cells. Cells and Culture Conditions—GM00637G SV40 transformed human fibroblasts were obtained and cultured as described (3Spitz D.R. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Galoforo S.S. Lee Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in McCoy's 5A media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PC-3 human prostate cancer cells were obtained from ATCC, and maintained in F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

These cells were grown in DMEM, 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml uridine for the rho(0) cells. All stock cultures were maintained in 5% CO2 and air in a humidified 37 °C incubator in the absence of antibiotics. All cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma and found to be negative. Glucose Deprivation Conditions and Cell Survival Experiments— Cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and grown for 3 days in the presence of antibiotics (gentamycin). At the beginning of each experiment, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove glucose and placed in glucose-free DMEM or RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum as described previously (7Lee Y.J.

Control cultures were treated identically except glucose was added back at the normal concentration found in the media. Then, drug treatment was initiated as appropriate.

Drug Treatment—AntA, Myx, Rot, dinitrophenol (DNP), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) were obtained from Sigma and used without further purification. Drugs were added to cells at final concentrations of 10 μm AntA and Myx, 50 μm Rot, 2 μm DNP, and 50 mm AT. Stock solutions of 10 mm AntA and Myx, 50 mm rotenone, and 2 mm DNP were dissolved in Me2SO, whereas 5 m AT was dissolved in PBS, and the required volume was added directly to the cells to achieve the desired final concentrations. All cells were incubated in glucose-free medium containing dialyzed serum with different drugs for the specified times. Measurement of Glutathione Levels—Following treatment, cells were scrape-harvested in PBS at 4 °C, centrifuged, the PBS discarded, and the cell pellets frozen at–80 °C. Samples were thawed and whole homogenates were prepared as described (7Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Sim J.E. Corry P.M. Spitz D.R. J. Biol.

Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were determined using a spectrophotometeric recycling assay (7Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Sim J.E.

All biochemical determinations were normalized to protein content using the method of Lowry et al. (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPR Spin Trapping of Oxygen Centered Radicals—DMPO was purchased from Sigma (D-5766). The stock solution of DMPO was prepared with nanopure water. The solution was purified by multiple centrifugations through activated charcoal (Sigma, C-5385) and filtered. The concentration of DMPO was determined with a HP 8453 UV-visible spectrometer at ϵ227 = 7800 m–1 cm–1. Purity was confirmed using EPR. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker X-band EMX spectrometer at room temperature. Instrument settings were: 9.77 GHz, microwave frequency; 100 kHz, modulation frequency; 40 milliwatt, nominal microwave power (13Buettner G.R. Kiminyo K.P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 1992; 24: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); 1.0 G, modulation amplitude; 3480 G center field for DMPO/·OH; 80 G/84 s scan rate; and 164-ms time constant. Each sample for EPR contained 7 × 106 freshly trypsinized cells in PBS and each spectrum was signal averaged, n = 15, to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Transduction of Antioxidant Enzymes—Replication incompetent adenoviral vectors, AdCMV BglII (AdBglII), AdCMV catalase (AdCAT), AdCMV mitochondrial catalase (AdMitCat), and AdCMV Mn-SOD (AdMn-SOD) were manufactured at The University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core by inserting the gene of interest into the E1 region of an Ad5 E1/particle E3 deleted replication-deficient adenoviral vector. The cDNAs were all under the control of a CMV promotor. Except for AdMitCat, the adenovirus constructs were originally prepared by John Engelhardt, University of Iowa (14Zwacka R.M. Dudus L. Epperly M.W. Greenburger J.S. Engelhardt J.F. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The full-length catalase cDNA with the Mn-SOD mitochondrial leader sequence added to the construct were originally prepared by Dr. Andre Melendez (15Bai J. Rodriquez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded until attached (overnight), and then the desired amount of viral particles was added with 1.8 ml of complete media per 60-mm dish for 24 h, then the media was changed and replaced by 4 ml of complete media and left for another 24 h prior to each experiment. Catalase Activity Assay—Catalase activity was determined on whole homogenates by measuring the disappearance of 10 mm hydrogen peroxide (Δϵ240 = 39.4 m–1 cm–1) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, monitored at 240 nm and the units were expressed as milli-k units/mg of protein as described (16Spitz D.R. Elwell J.H. Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Oberley T.D. Sullivan S.J. Roberts R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mn-SOD Activity Assay—SOD activity of whole homogenates prepared on ice following 2 freeze thaw cycles in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8, with 1.34 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) was determined using an indirect competitive inhibition assay (17Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the competition between SOD and an indicator molecule (nitro blue tetrazolium) for superoxide production from xanthine and xanthine oxidase, according to the method of Spitz and Oberley (17Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Incubation for at least 45 min with 5 mm sodium cyanide was used to inhibit CuZn-SOD activity to measure Mn-SOD activity. Preparation of Mitochondria—Twelve 15-cm culture dishes of PC-3 cells (transduced with AdMitCat or vector control) grown to 80% confluence were harvested and mitochondria were prepared as described previously (18Dobson A.W. Xu Y. Kelley M.R. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 278: 37518-37523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—To assay for catalase immunoreactive protein levels whole homogenates, intact mitochondria, and cytosolic fractions prepared as described above were sonicated at a duty cycle of 30% (50% for whole homogenates) (Sonics Vibracell, VC750) and an output control of 3 (4 for whole homogenates) for 10 s (20 s for whole homogenates), and the protein concentration was measured (Bradford method). Five to 40 μg of denatured protein was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane to measure catalase was incubated with rabbit anti-human catalase polyclonal antibody as the primary antibody (1:1,000) (Athens, Inc., Athens, GA), whereas for cytochrome c, the blots were incubated with rabbit anti-human cytochrome c polyclonal antibody as the primary antibody (1:500) (Santa Cruz), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as the second antibody (1:10,000) for both. Detection by the chemiluminescence reaction was carried out for 5 min using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), followed by exposure to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film (Eastman Kodak). Intracellular Prooxidant Production—Prooxidant production was determined using the oxidation-sensitive 5- (and-6)-carboxy-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (C-400, 10 μg/ml) and oxidation-insensitive 5- (and-6)-carboxy-2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (C-369, 10 μg/ml) fluorescent dyes (dissolved in Me2SO) obtained from Molecular Probes. The oxidized form of the dye acts as a control for changes in uptake, ester cleavage, and efflux, so that any changes in fluorescence seen between groups with the oxidation-sensitive dye can be directly attributed to changes in dye oxidation. Cells were treated for the indicated period and then harvested at 37 °C using trypsin, re-suspended in 37 °C glucose-free medium with or without drugs, labeled with the fluorescent dyes for 15 min at 37 °C, placed on ice, and analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) (excitation 488 nm, emission 535 nm). Normal glucose levels were added to the +glucose controls (5 mm). The mean fluorescence intensity of 20,000 cells was analyzed in each sample and corrected for autofluorescence from unlabeled cells. Hydrogen Peroxide Production—A method for estimating H2O2 production by monitoring the irreversible inactivation of catalase in the presence of AT was developed based on previous reports (19Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). PC-3 cells were infected with 50 m.o.i. AdCAT for 24 h, allowed to recover for 24 h in the absence of virus, and then placed in media in the presence and absence of glucose for 15 h. At the end of the 15-h incubation, 50 mm AT was added to the cultures and cells were harvested for catalase activity assay at 0 to 360 min of incubation. Inhibition of catalase activity was fit to a steady-state model as described previously (20Mackey M.A. Roti Roti J.L. J. Theor. Biol. 1992; 156: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was assumed that a transition to a new, final steady-state value of catalase activity was achieved over time according to the differential equation, dA/dt=−k(A−Af) where A is the catalase activity, k is a constant, and Af is the final steady-state catalase activity detected by the assay. Solving the above differential equation, we arrive at the following expression for the catalase activity as a function of time, A(t)=Af(1−e−kt)+A0e−kt where A0 is the catalase activity at time t0. Nonlinear least-squares regression analysis of the experimental data yielded estimates for the parameters Af, and k. Experimental data were fit to the above equation using the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares method (21Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C. Cambridge University Press, New York1988Google Scholar). This method yields the estimated parameter values, along with standard errors of these estimates. One-tailed Student's t tests were used to determine statistical significance of differences in fit parameters (p < 0.05). Measurement of Intracellular ATP Levels—Intracellular ATP was measured with the Bioluminescent Somatic Cell Assay Kit (Sigma) based on a described previously luciferin-luciferase assay (22Stanley P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 133: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Singh G. Lakkis C.L. Laucirica R. Epner D.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25,000 GM00637G SV40-transformed human fibroblasts were plated per well in 24-well plates. Two days later cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 2 or 8 h with (+Glu) or without (–Glu) glucose in the presence of DNP (2 μm) and AntA (10 μm) in triplicate. At the time of the assay, experimental medium was aspirated off and cells received 250 μl of a 2:1:1 mixture of somatic cell releasing agent (provided in the kit), water, and culture medium (glucose and serum-free). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Plates were swirled twice and 100 μl of the mixture from each well transferred into a 96-well plate, which already contained 100 μl of ATP assay mixture. Readings were obtained with a model 392 Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (ThermoLabsystems, Finland) with a 10-s delay time, a 30-s integrate time, and no pre-delay time. Results were obtained by comparison with a standard curve and normalized per mg of cellular protein as determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). NADP+/NADPH Measurement—Following the 24-h treatment with (+Glu) or without (–Glu) glucose, PC-3 cells were washed with PBS twice and scrape-harvested in PBS at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 320 × g for 5 min, cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of extraction buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01 m EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. The cell suspension was sonicated at a duty cycle of 34% (Sonics Vibracell, VC750) for 2 min at 30-s intervals in a cup horn filled with ice water. The solution was centrifuged at 5500 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and analyzed immediately for NADP+ and NADPH using a described previously method (25Zhang Z. Yu J. Stanton R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot (50 μl) of the extract was incubated with 950 μl of extraction buffer at 37 °C for 5 min and an absorbance measurement was taken at 340 nm. This reading measures the total amount of NADPH and NADH in the sample (A1). Another 50-μl aliquot of the extract was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in a reaction mixture containing 5.0 IU of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01 m MgCl2, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate. After incubation of the mixture at 37 °C for 5 min, absorbance measurement was taken at 340 nm. This reaction converted NADP+ to NADPH (A2). Finally, a 50-μl aliquot of the extract was preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min in a reaction mixture containing 5.0 IU of glutathione reductase, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 0.05 mm EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100. The reaction was initiated by the addition of glutathione disulfide (GSSG, 5 mm) to convert NADPH to NADP+. The tubes were incubated for an additional 5 min at 25 °C, and absorbance at 340 nm was determined (A3). Subtraction of A3 from A1 represents the total amount of NADPH in the sample. The total amount of NADP+ was calculated by subtracting the A1 from A2 (25Zhang Z. Yu J. Stanton R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Results were obtained by comparison with a standard curve and normalized per mg of cellular protein as determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Glutathione Reductase Measurement—Following 24 h treatment with (+Glu) or without (–Glu) glucose, PC-3 cells were washed with PBS twice and scrape-harvested in PBS at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 320 × g for 5 min, cell pellets were resuspended in potassium phosphate (100 mm), EDTA (3.4 mm) buffer. For each sample, a mixture containing 650 μl of ddH2O, 1500 μl of potassium/EDTA buffer, 350 μl of NADPH (0.8 mm), 100 μl of 30 mm GSSG, and 1% bovine serum albumin was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. An aliquot (100 μl) of the cell homogenate was added to this mixture and absorbance measurement was taken at 340 nm for 5 min. Maximum linear rates for both samples and blank were used to calculate units of glutathione reductase activity as described previously based on the extinction coefficient of β-NADPH at 340 nm (26Mavis R.D. Stellwagen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 809-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results were normalized per milligram of cellular protein as determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as mean ± 1 S.D. For analysis limited to two groups, Student's t test was employed (p < 0.05). Statistical comparisons among more than 2 treatment groups were accomplished using analysis of variance and the least significant difference test (p < 0.05) to determine differences between individual means. Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Blockers Enhance Glucose Deprivation-induced Cytotoxicity and Parameters Indicative of Oxidative Stress—The effect of ETCBs on glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and parameters indicative of oxidative stress was determined in GM00637G SV40-transformed human fibroblasts. GM00637G cell survival decreased dramatically after 8 h of glucose deprivation in the presence of AntA, Myx, and Rot (relative to Me2SO control), but these drugs were not toxic in the presence of glucose during this time frame (Fig. 1A). No cytotoxicity was seen in cells treated with DNP in the presence or absence of glucose. Glucose deprivation (8 h) in the presence of ETCBs also increased a parameter indicative of oxidative stress (GSSG) in GM00637G-transformed human fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). As was noted in the survival assay, the presence of DNP caused no changes in GSSG, relative to the Me2SO control. In addition, no significant changes in ATP levels could be detected during 8 h in the presence or absence of glucose in GM00637G cells treated with AntA or DNP (Table I), supporting the hypothesis that ATP depletion was unlikely to contribute to the observed effects.Table IATP levels in GM00637G cells treated with +/–Glu for 2 or 8 h (n = 3)GroupGlucoseATP levels2 h8 hnmol/mg proteinControl+0.253 ± 0.0150.249 ± 0.037-0.249 ± 0.0240.270 ± 0.001Ant A (10 μm)+0.260 ± 0.0260.306 ± 0.040-0."

This is of particular importance for photosynthesis, because changes in incident light intensity or quality can reduce the efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport and therefore the net energy fixation. Plants have developed many acclimatory mechanisms at the molecular level that enable them to cope with such changes. Most prominent responses are dynamic changes in the structure and composition of the photosynthetic apparatus (1Walters R.G. Horton P. Planta. 1994; 195: 248-256Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Anderson J.M. Chow W.S. Park Y.I. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 3Aro E.M. Andersson B. Regulation of Photosynthesis: Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht2001Crossref Google Scholar). Light quality and quantity gradients that occur e.g. in dense plant populations induce an imbalance in excitation energy distribution between the two photosystems (which work electrochemically in series) and therefore reduce photosynthetic efficiency. To counteract such imbalances plants re-distribute light energy in a short term by state transitions (4Haldrup A. Jensen P.E. Lunde C. Scheller H.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 301-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 5Allen J.F. Forsberg J. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 317-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and in a long term by a re-adjustment of photosystem stoichiometry. This results in a supply of more light quanta to the less active side of the electron transport chain (6Allen J.F. Pfannschmidt T. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol.

While the short term response acts via post-translational phosphorylation of existing antenna proteins, the long term response (LTR) 1The abbreviations used are: LTR, long term response; Chl, chlorophyll; DCMU, 3-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-1,1′-dimethyl urea; PAM, pulse-amplitude modulation; psaAB, chloroplast genes for PsaA and PsaB reaction center proteins of photosystem I; psbA, chloroplast gene for reaction center D1 protein of photosystem II; PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PEP, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase; μE, μmol photons per m2 and s. requires the synthesis of new components and hence has to affect gene expression. This implies signaling routes that connect photosynthetic electron transport/efficiency with the expression machinery. Studies in the last decade show that such functional connections exist at multiple levels and in virtually all classes of photosynthetic organisms.

To date three classes of redox signals can be distinguished: the first one is generated directly within the electron transport chain, the second is represented by photosynthesis-coupled redox-active compounds such as thioredoxin or glutathione, and the third is constituted by reactive oxygen species, which are unavoidable by-products of photosynthesis (29Pfannschmidt T. Allen J.F. Oelmuller R. Physiol. Plant. 2001; 112: 1-9Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30Dietz K.-J. Link G. Pistorius E.K. Scheibe R. Prog. Bot. 2002; 63: 207-245Crossref Google Scholar, 31Baier M. Dietz K.J. Prog. Bot. 1998; 60: 283-314Google Scholar). Such signals operate within the chloroplast, but have also been shown to affect the expression of some nuclear genes for plastid proteins. Therefore, they may represent a new class of the so-called “plastid signals” (32Pfannschmidt T. Schutze K. Fey V. Sherameti I. Oelmuller R. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Rodermel S. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 471-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 34Surpin M.

Sci. 2003; 358: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Retrograde signaling represents an important feedback control that couples the expression of nuclear encoded plastid proteins to the functional state of the chloroplast. Underlying signaling mechanisms in this communication still represent a great field of open questions in plant cell biology. To date neither the impact of retrograde redox signals on the nuclear transcriptome of chloroplasts nor possible interaction with other retrograde signals or with photoreceptor-mediated light signals are known while an interaction with sugar signals has been reported (19Oswald O. Martin T. Dominy P.J. Graham I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2047-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study we characterize the role of plastid redox signals in the regulation of plastid and nuclear genes during photosystem stoichiometry adjustment in Arabidopsis thaliana. By the use of this model organism we take advantage from the mutant and array resources available for this organism offering experimental strategies, which are not possible with tobacco and mustard used in earlier studies (9Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 14Pfannschmidt T. Schutze K. Brost M. Oelmuller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We describe for the first time the molecular response to PSI or PSII light in chloroplasts of A. thaliana. Determinations of glutathione content and redox state were performed to check possible interactions of different redox signals in this event. Cross-talk of the LTR with other signaling routes has been tested in mutants lacking either photoreceptors or components of plastid-to-nucleus signal pathways. By using a macroarray approach we determined the impact of plastid redox signals on the nuclear transcriptome of chloroplasts. Our study indicates that chloroplast redox signals from the thylakoid membrane represent a novel and separate class of plastid signals. Plant Growth—Plants were grown in temperature-controlled growth chambers at 22 °C under continuous light. Arabidopsis seeds (var. Col 0 or Landsberg erecta and mutant lines in the respective backgrounds) were sown either sterile on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1.35% sucrose or on earth substituted with vermiculite. Density of seeds was adjusted in such a way that 16-day-old plants did not shadow each other. After 2 days at 4 °C plants were grown for 10 days under white light provided by 30-watt white stripe lamps (OSRAM, München, Germany) with a photosynthetic-active radiation of ∼35 μE. This white light pre-treatment was found to be necessary for the plants to develop a normal leaf anatomy and hence a true acclimatory response. Direct germination and growth under the PSI or PSII light sources resulted in aberrant leaf anatomy due to the lack of blue radiation of these light sources. After growth in white light, plants were acclimated to PSI (photosynthetic active radiation, ∼20 μE) or PSII (photosynthetic active radiation, ∼30 μE) light for 6 days or they were first acclimated to one light source for 2 days followed by 4 days under the respective other light source. PSI and PSII light sources have been described earlier (9Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 12Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Tullberg A. Link G. Allen J.F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 271-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the incandescent bulbs of the PSI light source were replaced by 18-watt fluorescent stripe lamps “Red” (OSRAM, München, Germany) of the same photon flux density to reduce thermal radiation. The photosynthetic active radiation was determined by using the lightmeter LI-250 (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). It must be noted that the far-red spectrum of the PSI light is outside of the detection range of the LI-250. White light control plants were grown for 16 days under the white light source alone. Chlorophyll Fluorescence Measurements—In vivo Chl a fluorescence parameters were determined at room temperature with a pulse amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometer (PAM101/103, Heinz Walz). 10–15 seedlings grown on MS medium were measured simultaneously as described previously (14Pfannschmidt T. Schutze K. Brost M. Oelmuller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). After dark acclimation (8–10 min) the measuring beam was turned on, and minimal fluorescence (Fo) was determined. Then leaves were exposed to a 500-ms flash of saturating white light (6000 μE) to determine maximal fluorescence (Fm) and the optimum quantum yield Fv/Fm value was calculated as Fm – Fo/Fm (36van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Subsequently, leaves were illuminated with 100 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 of actinic red light of 600 nm (Walz 102-R). Fluorescence was recorded in the saturation pulse mode by application of saturating flashes every 30 s to determine maximal fluorescence of illuminated leaves (Fm′) until a stable fluorescence level (Ft) was reached. Actinic light was switched off, and far-red light (Walz 102-FR) was turned on to oxidize the electron transport chain and to determine minimal fluorescence (Fo′) in the light-acclimated state. The steady-state fluorescence Fs was then calculated as Ft – Fo′ = Fs. The optimum quantum yield describes the maximal photosynthetic capacity of a plant and was taken as a measure for photosynthetic efficiency of the mutant lines analyzed in this study in comparison to wild type. For wild type we found Fv/Fm values of 0.8–0.83, which typically indicate that the plant analyzed has no decreased photosynthetic efficiency. Only plants with a wild type like behavior were tested for their response to the two light sources. A proper acclimation response to PSI or PSII light is characterized by a significant change in the Fs/Fm value as shown earlier (14Pfannschmidt T. Schutze K. Brost M. Oelmuller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and reflects the structural differences in the photosynthetic apparatus of these plants. The difference of 10 μE in photosynthetic active radiation between PSI and PSII light has no detectable impact on this acclimation, because in control experiments PSI plants showed the same decrease in Fs/Fm after acclimation to either 20 or 30 μE PSII light (data not shown). One-way analysis of variance was used to reveal significant differences in Fs/Fm values of plants grown under the defined conditions. Light treatment was used as a factor, and the Fs/Fm value as a dependent variable. If a significant influence of light treatment was determined, post-hoc tests (pairwise multiple comparison test for lowest significance difference) was performed to find out which groups differ from each other. p < 0.5 determines significant differences between various samples (see Supplementary Table SI). All tests were performed using SPSS 11.5. Chlorophyll Content Determination—Total chlorophyll was determined spectroscopically after grinding of leaves in liquid nitrogen and extracting chlorophylls with 80% (v/v) buffered acetone. Concentrations of chlorophylls a and b were calculated by using the extinction coefficients from previous studies (37Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Western Analyses of Chloroplast Proteins—20 g of leaf material of plants grown on soil were harvested under the respective light source and directly homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 0.05 m Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0, 0.33 m sorbitol, 0.001 m MgCl2, and 0.002 m EDTA. The material was filtered through four layers of muslin and one layer of Miracloth, followed by a centrifugation (10 s at 6000 rpm). The pellet was washed twice in homogenization buffer and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Concentrations of chloroplasts were determined microscopically by counting diluted aliquots in a Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber. 2 × 105 plastids of each preparation were lysed and denatured in 5× SDS sample buffer (final concentrations: 0.4% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) by incubation for 5 min at 95 °C. Insoluble particles were removed by centrifugation, and samples were loaded on denaturing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and separated overnight at 45 V. Proteins were transferred to a nylon membrane (Roti-Nylon Plus, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 400 mA for 1 h using a semi-dry blotting apparatus, and the membrane was saturated in Tris-buffered saline containing 2% fat-free milk powder. Incubation with polyclonal antisera followed standard protocols (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibodies for D1, Lhca3, and Lhcb1 were purchased from AgriSera (Vannas, Sweden). Detection of the first antibody was performed with a goat-anti-rabbit-IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, München, Germany) and the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection system. For visualization of marker proteins and to prove blotting efficiency, membranes were stained with Amido Black (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) after the ECL reaction. RNA Preparations—RNA for primer extension analyses was isolated from plants grown on MS medium. RNA for array analyses was isolated from wild-type (Col-0) plants grown on soil. Leaf material was harvested and frozen in liquid N2 under the respective light source. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following a protocol described earlier (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Concentration and purity of RNA samples were determined spectroscopically in a Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Intactness was proven by ethidium bromide staining of rRNA species after electrophoretic separation of aliquots on denaturing 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Isolated RNA was stored at –80 °C until further use. Primer Extension Analyses—Primer extension analyses (41Ghosh P.K. Reddy V.B. Swinscoe J. Choudary P.V. Lebowitz P. Weissman S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3643-3647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were carried out according to a protocol from Li-Cor (Bad Homburg, Germany). 5 μg of total RNA was resolved in 20 μl of hybridization mixture containing 1.25 μm infrared dye 700-labeled psaA-specific and infrared dye 800-labeled psbA-specific primers and 18 μl hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4). After denaturation at 80 °C for 15 min RNA/primer hybrids were allowed to form at room temperature for 1 h. Hybrids were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 96% EtOH at –80 °C for 30 min and washed with 100 μl of 70% EtOH. Precipitates were dried and resolved in 2 μl of 5× buffer for Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 4 μlof 5 mm dNTPs, 3 μl of H2O, and 1 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas, 200 units/μl)), and incubated 1hat42 °C. 1 μl of the samples was mixed 1:1 with formamide loading dye (Amersham Biosciences), applied onto a sequencing gel (4% acrylamide, 1× TBE (0.089 m Tris, 0.089 m boric acid, 0.002 m EDTA, ph 8.0), 7 m urea, 66 cm × 0.25 mm) and separated according to Li-Cor (Bad Homburg, Germany) recommendations. Gene-specific primer sequences: psaA, 5′ infrared dye 700, 5′-CCC ATT CCT CGA AAG-3′ (sequence position +65 to +79 relative to ATG); psbA, 5′ infrared dye 800, 5′-AGA CGG TTT TCA GTG-3′ (sequence position +69 to +83 relative to ATG). The same primers were used to sequence the respective region of Arabidopsis chloroplast DNA using a cycle sequencing kit (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Roth, Germany). Determination of Thiol Group Content and Redox State of Glutathione—For isolation of total glutathione and cysteine 25 mg of leaf material was ground in liquid N2 and extracted with 0.5 ml of buffer E (100 mm phosphate, pH 7.1, 50% methanol, 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min at 60 °C while shaking. Homogenates were centrifuged twice at 15,400 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and supernatants were used for further analysis. Determination of oxidized glutathione was based on the same extraction, but dithiothreitol in buffer E was replaced by 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide to block reduced glutathione (42Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Reduction of oxidized thiols in the extracts (0.02 ml) was carried out at room temperature for 60 min in a total volume of 0.27 ml containing 134 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Then thiols were derivatized for 15 min by adding 0.03 ml of monobromobimane (Calbiochem, La Jolla) to a final concentration of 3 mm (2.5-fold excess above total thiol concentration). Resulting monobromobimane derivatives were stabilized by addition of 0.7 ml of 5% acetic acid and detected fluorometrically (Fluorometer RF 551, Shimadzu) at 480 nm by excitation at 380 nm after separation by reverse-phase HPLC using a Waters HPLC-system (Waters 600E Multisolvent Delivery system, Autosampler 717plus) connected to a Nova-Pak C18 4.6 × 250-mm column (pore size, 4 μm). Glutathione and other thiols were separated by applying an isocratic flow (1.3 ml/min) of buffer A (100 mm potassium acetate, pH 5.5, 9% methanol) for 12.5 min. The column matrix was washed with 100% methanol for 3 min and re-equilibrated for 8.5 min in buffer A. Data acquisition and processing was performed with Millenium32 software (Waters). Reduced glutathione concentrations were calculated from the difference between total and oxidized glutathione. Recovery rates were higher than 95% for reduced and oxidized glutathione and higher than 90% for cysteine, respectively, as determined by spiking of samples with internal standards. Samples were analyzed in quadruplicate. Expression Profiling—The 3292-GST nylon array, including 2661 nuclear chloroplast genes and 631 genes coding for non-chloroplast proteins, has been described previously (43Richly E. Dietzmann A. Biehl A. Kurth J. Laloi C. Apel K. Salamini F. Leister D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with plant material corresponding to pools of at least 250–500 individuals. To obtain larger amounts of tissue of healthy and unstressed plants, seedlings were initially grown 22 days under white light (short day periods, 8-h light/16-h dark) on soil. Plants were then acclimated to: (i) PSI light (5 days), (ii) PSI light (3 days) followed by PSII light (2 days), (iii) PSI light (3 days) followed by PSII light plus 5 μm DCMU (2 days), or (iv) PSI light plus 5 μm DCMU. DCMU (Sigma) has been applied to plants directly before performing the light shifts using a fine sprayer as described before (14Pfannschmidt T. Schutze K. Brost M. Oelmuller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36125-36130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DCMU stock solution was 10 mm in 50% ethanol, and the applied concentration was prepared by dilution in sterile water directly prior use. The drug was found to be completely stable during the 2-day period of experiment as determined by the effect on chlorophyll a fluorescence using a PAM101 fluorometer. Effects of DCMU on photosynthetic electron flow have been proven by determination of ΦPSII (44Genty B. Briantais J.-M. Baker N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 87-92Crossref Scopus (7061) Google Scholar) at the end of the treatments (PSI: 0.72 ± 0.02; PSI–II: 0.8 ± 0.02; PSI–II plus DCMU: 0.49 ± 0.05; PSI plus DCMU: 0.53 ± 0.05). Three independent experiments with different filters and independent cDNA probes were performed thus minimizing variation between individual plants, filters, or probes. cDNA synthesis was primed by using a mixture of oligonucleotides matching the 3292 genes in antisense orientation and hybridized to the GST array as described (43Richly E.

Salamini F. Leister D. Planta. 2002; 215: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Images were read using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization images were imported into the ArrayVision program (version 6, Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada), where artifacts were removed, background correction was performed, and resulting values were normalized with reference to intensity of all spots on the array (45Kurth J. Varotto C. Pesaresi P. Biehl A. Richly E. Salamini F. Leister D. Planta. 2002; 215: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the next step, those data were imported into the ArrayStat program (version 1.0 Rev. 2.0, Imaging Research Inc.), and a z-test (nominal α set to 0.05) was performed employing false discovery rate (46Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. Roy. Stat. Soc. Series B Method. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar) correction to identify statistically significant differential expression values. Only differential expression values fulfilling the criteria of this statistical procedure were used for the expression profiling. Changes in Photosystem Structure of Arabidopsis during Acclimation to PSI and PSII light and Transcriptional Regulation of Plastid Reaction Center Genes psaA and psbA—Imbalances in excitation energy distribution between the photosystems can be induced by illumination with light sources that differentially excite PSII or PSI (PSII or PSI light, respectively) resulting either in a more reduced or more oxidized state of the electron transport components (data n"

https://openalex.org/W2009880140,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form chromatin-associated, transcriptionally repressive complexes, which are critically involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Although the mechanisms involved in PcG-mediated repression are beginning to unravel, little is known about the regulation of PcG function. We showed previously that PcG complexes are phosphorylated in vivo, which regulates their association with chromatin. The nature of the responsible PcG kinases remained unknown. Here we present the novel finding that the PcG protein Bmi1 is phosphorylated by 3pK (MAPKAP kinase 3), a convergence point downstream of activated ERK and p38 signaling pathways and implicated in differentiation and developmental processes. We identified 3pK as an interaction partner of PcG proteins, in vitro and in vivo, by yeast two-hybrid interaction and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. Activation or overexpression of 3pK resulted in phosphorylation of Bmi1 and other PcG members and their dissociation from chromatin. Phosphorylation and subsequent chromatin dissociation of PcG complexes were expected to result in de-repression of targets. One such reported Bmi1 target is the Cdkn2a/INK4A locus. Cells overexpressing 3pK showed PcG complex/chromatin dissociation and concomitant de-repression of p14ARF, which was encoded by the Cdkn2a/INK4A locus. Thus, 3pK is a candidate regulator of phosphorylation-dependent PcG/chromatin interaction. We speculate that phosphorylation may not only affect chromatin association but, in addition, the function of individual complex members. Our findings linked for the first time MAPK signaling pathways to the Polycomb transcriptional memory system. This suggests a novel mechanism by which a silenced gene status can be modulated and implicates PcG-mediated repression as a dynamically controlled process.

Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation cascades may function as switching mechanisms that modulate gene activity (2Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). 3pK, also known as MAPK-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPKAPK3), belongs to a growing family of kinases that are activated by one or more members of the MAPK family (3Ludwig S.

To better understand processes regulated by 3pK, we aimed to identify interactors and potential novel substrates of 3pK. Here, we report the finding of a group of novel interaction partners of 3pK, the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, including the mammalian PcG proteins HPH2 and Bmi1 (4Gunster M.J. Satijn D.P.

PcG proteins form large multimeric protein complexes that associate with chromatin (reviewed in Refs. 9Orlando V. Paro R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The current view is that PcG-mediated silencing in mammals involves generation and recognition of histone modifications; a subset of PcG complexes, the EED·EZH complex (hPRC2 complex), associates with histone deacetylases, implicating histone tail deacetylation in PcG-mediated repression (11van der Vlag J. Otte A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Within this complex, EZH2 was identified as a histone methyltransferase with preference for histone H3 lysine 27 (12Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y.

The current view is that PcG-mediated repressional maintenance involves a combination of (associated) catalytic activities responsible for post-translational modifications on histone tails and extensive interactions among PcG members and other chromatin (-bound) factors, which generate a repressive higher order chromatin structure inaccessible to transcriptional activators and chromatin remodeling factors (8Simon J.A.

Little is known about how chromatin association and, potentially, function of PcG complexes is controlled. In the present study, we identified Polycomb group (PcG) proteins as in vivo interaction partners of the MAPKAP kinase 3pK. We have provided evidence that MAPK signal transduction cascades target PcG·protein complex/chromatin interaction through phosphorylation. 3pK acts as a Bmi1 kinase in vitro and in vivo. Of relevance, 3pK overexpression causes PcG/protein dissociation from chromatin and de-repression of the Cdkn2a/INK4A locus. Our data support a model in which Polycomb-mediated repression is modulated by stress- and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. These findings point to a molecular mechanism by which a transcriptionally silenced gene status can be reprogrammed and implicates PcG-mediated repression as a dynamically controlled process. These observations are expected to have important implications in understanding epigenetic mechanisms in development and disease.

Yeast Two-hybrid System—A kinase-inactive 3pK mutant (K73M) was used as bait in two-hybrid screens against a human heart MATCH-MAKER cDNA library cloned into the pGAD10 vector (Clontech). Yeast strain CG-1945 (Clontech) was manipulated according the manufacturer's instructions. Positive clones were monitored by growth on SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His plates and activity of the lacZ reporter gene in filter assays. In direct two-hybrid assays, reselected SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His filters were incubated for 12–24 h at 30 °C before the β-Gal assay was performed.

Titers of LZRS·IRES·GFP (Bmi1, 3pK, or control) viral supernatants were sufficiently high to achieve near 100% infection; infection with pBABE-GST (3pK or control) virus was followed by selection with puromycin. G0/G1 arrest of cells was established by contact inhibition and/or a 48-h serum starvation period (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% FCS). M phase enrichment was achieved by adding colcemid (0.01 μg/ml) to S phase-synchronized cells, acquired by a double thymidine block (2 × 2 mm; 15–15 h) essentially as published previously (27Ishida R.

The cells were incubated for 3 min at ambient temperature, gently pelleted, and the supernatant was collected (soluble fraction). The pellet was carefully washed once in nuclear buffer and extracted in IP0.1 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m Potassium acetate, 1 mm NaVO4, 50 mm NaF; chromatin-bound fraction) as described previously (34Muchardt C.

Immune Complex Kinase Assay—GST·3pK and HA·Bmi1 immune complexes were immunoprecipitated separately and combined and washed twice in high salt radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (500 mm NaCl) and kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 25mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO4; (3Ludwig S.

In control experiments, GST·3pK-containing immune complexes were incubated with Hsp27 as a substrate. The kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30–120 min in kinase buffer supplemented with 3–5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and 0.02–0.1 mm cold ATP. In vitro kinase assays with recombinant protein utilized 1 μg of kinase (3pK-EE) and 5 μg of substrate (His- or GST-tagged Bmi1). 3pK Binds the C Terminus of HPH2 in Vitro—In two independent yeast two-hybrid screens using an inactive 3pK (K73M) variant as bait, 20 overlapping clones containing cDNA of the human Polyhomeotic protein (HPH2) were isolated (Fig. 1A). These clones represented 73, 145, 198, or 209 C-terminal amino acid fragments of HPH2 (Fig. 1A). In a direct yeast two-hybrid test, 3pK also interacted with a larger HPH2 C-terminal fragment of 298 aa and the putative full-length HPH2 (432 aa) (Fig. 1, A and B). The C-terminal 3pK interaction domain of HPH2 (Fig. 1A) overlaps with the α-helical HDII/SPM/SAM domain involved in hetero- and homotypic interactions between several Polycomb proteins (4Gunster M.J. Satijn D.P. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J.L. de Bruijn D. Alkema M.J. van Lohuizen M. van Driel R. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2326-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Alkema M.J.

Mutational analysis of the C-198 fragment was used to further investigate the role of the HDII domain in the HPH2/3pK interaction. The HDII domain contains at least five distinct α-helical (α1–α5) structures (37Kim C.A. Gingery M. Pilpa R.M. Bowie J.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 453-457PubMed Google Scholar). C-terminal deletions removing these α-helices prevent HPH2/3pK interaction (Fig. 1A, lower inset). Removal of the C-terminal-most helix (α5) is sufficient to completely abolish interaction. The requirement of an intact α5 was confirmed by the introduction of selected point mutations in α5 (Fig. 1A, asterisks on lower panel), which are predicted to be present on the surface of the protein and therefore may be required for the interaction with 3pK. Removing the basic side chain through exchange of K422A prevented interaction between HPH2 C-198 and 3pK completely, whereas exchange of L417A led to a reduction of protein association. 3pK (K73M) displays high affinity for the shorter HPH2 fragments, in particular for the C-terminal 73 fragment (Fig. 1A). This may relate to binding-site masking in full-length HPH2. Interestingly, mutation of known phosphorylation sites on 3pK (e.g. T313E, T313A, T201E/T313E) does not alter binding affinity as compared with the wild type kinase (not shown), suggesting that HPH2 binding is independent of Thr201/Thr313 phosphorylation. Thus, the HDII/SPM/SAM domain plays an important role in HPH2/3pK interaction. 3pK Complexes with PcG Proteins in Vivo—Interaction between 3pK and the individual HPH2 fragments in mammalian cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown) with results consistent with the quantitative yeast two-hybrid data (Fig. 1A). The finding that 3pK is a binding partner of HPH2 suggests that the kinase may be part of a PcG complex and may also be associated with other PcG proteins. Biochemical analysis indeed confirms that HA-tagged Bmi1, a direct binding partner of HPH1/2 (4Gunster M.J. Satijn D.P. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J.L. de Bruijn D.

In vivo, GST-3pK co-precipitates with endogenous PcG proteins, such as (h)Rnf2 (Fig. 1C), which is part of the hPRC1 complex (38Hemenway C.S. Halligan B.W. Levy L.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Suzuki M. Mizutani-Koseki Y. Fujimura Y. Miyagishima H. Kaneko T. Takada Y. Akasaka T. Tanzawa H. Takihara Y. Nakano M. Masumoto H. Vidal M. Isono K. Koseki H. Development (Camb.). 2002; 29: 4171-4183Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to a 3pK-activating agent, the stress-inducer arsenite (3Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), does not alter the interaction quantitatively in these cells (not shown), again suggesting that phosphorylation of 3pK does not affect PcG association. This is in line with the comparable interaction of 3pK phosphorylation-site mutants with HPH2 described above. In a reciprocal experiment, Bmi1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-3pK antiserum in both U2OS cell extracts (Fig. 1C) and HeLa cell extracts with high Bmi1 levels (Fig. 1D). Finally, we showed that endogenous proteins co-precipitate (Fig. 1E); this interaction was specific, because two unrelated kinases, AKT and Gsk3β, did not co-precipitate hPRC1 core members (Fig. 1E). These biochemical data demonstrated association of 3pK with PcG proteins in vivo, without the need for overexpressed binding partners. Mitogen- and Stress-induced Phosphorylation of Bmi1 in Vitro and in Vivo—3pK is a kinase activated by both stress stimuli and mitogenic signals. Activation by mitogens, such as serum and TPA, occurs almost exclusively via the ERK pathway, whereas stress stimulation with arsenite recruits the MAPKAPK to the p38 MAPK cascade (3Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined whether PcG proteins may represent downstream targets of these MAP kinase cascades by applying the respective stimuli. We focused on Bmi1, because chromatin association of Bmi1 correlates with its phosphorylation status (26Voncken J.W. Schweizer D. Aagaard L. Sattler L. Jantsch M.F. van Lohuizen M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4627-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK activation, via mitogenic stimulation of serum-starved cells, leads to a rapid and readily detectable phosphorylation of Bmi1 in vivo; activation of p38, via arsenite, induces a much stronger hyperphosphorylation of Bmi1 as compared with mitogenic stimulation (Fig. 2A). Importantly, serum starvation prior to activation in these experiments precludes cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation (26Voncken J.W. Schweizer D. Aagaard L. Sattler L. Jantsch M.F. van Lohuizen M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4627-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from interfering with these assays. Phosphatase treatment of PcG proteins extracted from arsenite-exposed cells establishes phosphorylation as the main post-translational modification on PcG proteins in response to p38 activation (Fig. 2B). We then studied the effect of protein phosphorylation on PcG core complex/protein interaction. As indicated in Fig. 2C, interaction of known PcG core complex partners, such as HPH1 and HPc2 (14Levine S.S. Weiss A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Shao Z. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6070-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), is at least in part preserved, as they still co-immunoprecipitate with Bmi1. Stress (Fig. 2D) or mitogenic (data not shown) stimulation result in Bmi1 phosphorylation in HeLa and 293T cells and, importantly, also in primary human TIG3 fibroblasts, showing that the observation is not cell-type restricted or linked to a specific cellular phenotype. Ground-state phosphorylation comparison in the different cell types also reveals that Bmi1 is already phosphorylated in some serum-starved established cell lines (Fig. 2, A and D). This would be consistent with a constitutive activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways in some cancer cell lines. Arsenite-induced Bmi1 pho"

In this study we investigated whether SAA is a ligand for the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and how SAA may influence SR-BI-mediated HDL binding and selective cholesteryl ester uptake. Studies using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SR-BI showed that 125I-labeled SAA, both in lipid-free form and in reconstituted HDL particles, functions as a high affinity ligand for SR-BI. SAA also bound with high affinity to the hepatocyte cell line, HepG2. Alexa-labeled SAA was shown by fluorescence confocal microscopy to be internalized by cells in a SR-BI-dependent manner. To assess how SAA association with HDL influences HDL interaction with SR-BI, SAA-containing HDL was isolated from mice overexpressing SAA through adenoviral gene transfer. SAA presence on HDL had little effect on HDL binding to SR-BI but decreased (30–50%) selective cholesteryl ester uptake. Lipid-free SAA, unlike lipid-free apoA-I, was an effective inhibitor of both SR-BI-dependent binding and selective cholesteryl ester uptake of HDL. We have concluded that SR-BI plays a key role in SAA metabolism through its ability to interact with and internalize SAA and, further, that SAA influences HDL cholesterol metabolism through its inhibitory effects on SR-BI-mediated selective lipid uptake.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). During the acute phase response, SAA synthesis can account for as much as 2.5% of total protein production in the liver and plasma SAA levels can exceed 1 mg/ml, implying a beneficial role of SAA in host defense. SAA synthesis induced by inflammatory stimuli has also been detected in adipocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, and muscle cells (1Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). SAA is a precursor of amyloid A protein, the principal component of reactive systematic amyloid that may be deposited in organs as a result of chronic inflammatory disease (3Sipe J. Amyloid. 1999; 6: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The SAA gene family is highly conserved in mammals and in humans consists of four closely related genes; SAA1 and SAA2 encode for the acute phase proteins SAA1 and SAA2, SAA3 is a pseudogene, and SAA4 encodes the constitutively expressed SAA that is found in low levels in both normal and acute phase plasma (1Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 3Sipe J. Amyloid. 1999; 6: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mouse Saa1 and Saa2 genes are evolutionary homologues of the human SAA1 and SAA2 genes, respectively. Unlike human SAA3, mouse Saa3 is expressed as a protein. Interestingly, expression of mouse Saa3 is largely extrahepatic and has been demonstrated in macrophages and other non-hepatic cells (4Ramadori G. Sipe J.D. Colten H.R. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3645-3647PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse Saa4, like human SAA4, is a constitutively expressed protein (5de Beer M.C. Yuan T. Kindy M.S. Asztalos B.F. Roheim P.S. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 526-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acute phase SAA1 and SAA2 are allelic, giving rise to three distinct SAA1 proteins (SAA1.1-SAA1.3) and two SAA2 proteins (SAA2.1 and SAA2.2). SAA shares many structural features with other apolipoproteins, including an amphipathic α-helix at the amino terminus that may be responsible for binding SAA to HDL. Both acute phase and constitutively expressed SAAs associate strongly with HDL and are present in the plasma largely as apolipoproteins of HDL3 (6Coetzee G.A. van der Strachan A.F. Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C. Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9644-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the acute phase response, SAA can replace apoA-I as the major HDL apolipoprotein (6Coetzee G.A. van der Strachan A.F. Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C. Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9644-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological function of SAA remains unclear (reviewed in Refs. 1Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar and 2Kisilevsky R. Tam S.P. Pediatr. Pathol. Mol. Med. 2002; 21: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A number of studies have suggested a role of SAA in the inflammatory process, probably acting via the G-protein-coupled receptor FPRL1 (7Su S.B. Gong W. Gao J.L. Shen W. Murphy P.M. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In line with its association with HDL, it is plausible that SAA might regulate the role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport. SAA has been reported in some (8Hayat S. Raynes J.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 348SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tam S.P. Flexman A. Hulme J. Kisilevsky R. J.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), studies to promote cholesterol efflux from cells such as macrophages to HDL. Mouse Saa2.1 (but not Saa1.1) is able to inhibit intracellular cholesterol esterification in macrophages while at the same time activating neutral cholesterol esterase and hence cholesterol ester (CE) hydrolysis (9Tam S.P. Flexman A. Hulme J. Kisilevsky R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1410-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Such effects, together with enhanced binding of acute phase HDL to macrophages (11Banka C.L. Yuan T. de Beer M.C. Kindy M. Curtiss L.K. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kisilevsky R. Subrahmanyan L. Lab. Investig. 1992; 66: 778-785PubMed Google Scholar) could promote free cholesterol efflux from cells and facilitate cholesterol removal from sites of tissue damage. An alternative hypothesis is that SAA promotes cholesterol delivery to cells during tissue repair. SAA binds cholesterol and can transport cholesterol into macrophages (13Liang J.S. Schreiber B.M. Salmona M. Phillip G. Gonnerman W.A. de Beer F.C. Sipe J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2109-2116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased HDL binding to macrophages might also promote HDL cholesterol uptake into these cells (11Banka C.L. Yuan T. de Beer M.C. Kindy M. Curtiss L.K. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These possibilities and their underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. The scavenger receptor SR-BI is an HDL receptor that mediates the cellular uptake of CE from HDL by a mechanism known as selective lipid uptake (14Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 15Connelly M.A. Williams D.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). SR-BI in the liver plays a key role in the clearance of HDL CE, thereby facilitating the process of reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery to the liver. SR-BI also facilitates the efflux of cellular-free cholesterol to HDL. The receptor exhibits a broad ligand binding specificity and binds LDL, oxidized LDL, and very low density lipoprotein in addition to HDL (14Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Anionic phospholipids bind to SR-BI, as do the apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-III, and E, either as lipid-bound molecules or as free apolipoproteins. The effect of SAA on HDL binding and selective lipid uptake by SR-BI has not been investigated. In this study we have demonstrated that both lipid-free and lipid-bound SAA is bound and internalized by SR-BI and that SAA exerts an inhibitory effect on HDL binding and selective lipid uptake. Materials—l-α-palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, crystalline cholesterol, sodium cholate, and fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma. Human ApoA-I and human SAA (recombinant human SAA, corresponding to human SAA1 α except for the presence of an N-terminal methionine and substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 60 and arginine for histidine at position 71) were purchased from Biodesign (Saco, ME). The Alexa fluorescent labeling kits were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Animals—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. Mouse SAA overexpression was obtained by tail vein injection of a second generation recombinant adenovirus expressing the mouse CE/J isoform of Saa that closely resembles both Saa1 and Saa2 (16de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Kindy M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20606-20612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SAA adenovirus, AdSAA, was prepared as described previously (17Webb N.R. van der de Beer M.C. Westhuyzen D.R. Kindy M.S. Banka C.L. Tsukamoto K. Rader D.L. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1583-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4 × 1011 particles of AdSAA adenovirus or Ad-null virus (a virus containing no transgene) were injected into each mouse. Animals were taken 72 h after virus infusion, blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and HDL was isolated as described below. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Lexington, KY). Cell Culture—Stable transfectants of CHO cells expressing human SR-BI (CHO-SR-BI cells) were generated as described elsewhere (18Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and cultured in medium containing 0.25 g/liter geneticin (Invitrogen). CHO cells were grown in Hams F12 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Clones were screened for expression of the scavenger receptors by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing the extracellular domain of SR-BI (18Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A.

For biochemical assays, CHO cells were grown in 12-well clusters (Corning Corp., Corning, NY). For microscopy, CHO cells were grown on glass coverslips. Isolation and Radiolabeling of HDL—HDL3 was isolated from human plasma as described previously (19Strachan A.F. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, HDL3 (d = 1.13–1.18) was isolated from EDTA anti-coagulated human blood. Mouse HDL (d = 1.063–1.21) was isolated from EDTA anti-coagulated blood obtained by cardiac puncture from metofane-anesthetized mice. HDLs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation, dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), sterile filtered, and stored under nitrogen gas at 4 °C. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry. HDL was iodinated by the iodine monochloride method as described before (20de Beer M.C. Castellani L.W. Cai L. Stromberg A.J. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 706-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the free apolipoproteins ranged from 101 to 132 cpm/ng protein, and the specific activity for reconstituted HDL (rHDL) ranged from 143–395 cpm/ng protein. For studies involving selective lipid uptake, HDL was double-labeled by iodination of the protein component and by tracing the CE component with nonhydrolyzable, intracellularly trapped [1,2(n)-3H] cholesterol oleyl ether as described previously (20de Beer M.C. Castellani L.W. Cai L. Stromberg A.J. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 706-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, [1,2(n)-3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether was dried in a 12 × 75-mm borosilicate glass tube (20 μCi/mg HDL protein), after which HDL and partially purified cholesteryl ester transfer protein were added. Following 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, HDL was re-isolated by ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.21 g/ml. The specific activity of the 125I-protein component of HDL ranged from 144 to 196cpm/ng protein. The specific activity of the [3H]CE-HDL ranged from 10 to 17 dpm/ng protein. The integrity of radiolabeled HDL preparations was verified by SDS-PAGE and non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Ligand Binding and Uptake Assays—Cell association assays were performed as described previously (18Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Mirocha N. Jonas A. Webb N.R. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15832-15839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded into 12-well cell culture clusters at an initial density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2. When the cells reached confluency, they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times with radiolabeled ligands in Hams-F12 medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.5% BSA. For 4 °C binding, cells were preincubated in the above medium at 37 °C for 1 h, washed twice with ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA), and then incubated with HEPES-buffered Ham-F12 medium containing 0.5% BSA. At the end of the binding experiments, medium was removed and the cells were washed four times with cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing BSA (2 mg/ml) followed by two washes in the same buffer without BSA. The cells were then solubilized in 0.1 N NaOH for 60 min at room temperature, and the protein and 125I content of the lysate were determined. [3H]CE content was determined after lipid extraction. Cell association values are expressed as apparent HDL protein uptake assuming the uptake of intact holoparticles. Ligand degradation products in the culture medium were assayed as described (21de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Mirocha N. Jonas A. Webb N.R. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15832-15839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Selective uptake is defined as 3H - (125I cell-associated + 125I degraded) and represents the uptake of cholesteryl ester that cannot be accounted for by the internalization of intact particles. SR-BI-specific values were calculated as the difference between the values for CHO-SR-BI and untransfected CHO cells (CHO-A7). Kd values were determined by non-linear regression analysis of receptor-specific cell association values using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Preparation of rHDL—Reconstituted HDL containing palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and apoA-I or SAA were prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method as described previously (21de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Mirocha N. Jonas A. Webb N.R. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15832-15839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human apoA-I or human SAA were prepared using molar ratios of 1/5/95, apolipoprotein/free cholesterol/palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine. The purity and size of rHDL were examined on 8–25% gradient gels under non-denaturing conditions using the Amersham Biosciences Phast system. Protein concentrations of lipid-free or lipid-bound apoA-I and SAA were determined by the Lowry assay. Experiments were performed within 7 days of particle preparation to avoid time-dependent size rearrangement of particles. Cell Association and Uptake of Fluorescent-labeled Apolipoproteins— Human apoA-I/SAA reconstituted HDLs or free apolipoproteins were labeled with Alexa according to the manufacturer's (Molecular Probes) instructions. Briefly, apolipoproteins were incubated with Alexa 488 (green fluorescence) or Alexa 568 (red fluorescence) for 1 h at room temperature (1 mg protein/vial dye). Fluorescently labeled proteins were purified using a 30-mm resin column and stored at 4 °C under N2 gas. Cells were grown on glass coverslips until 50–70% confluent and then incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of Alexa-labeled SAA or apoA-I in 0.5% BSA-containing medium for another 2 h. Cells were then washed five times with cold PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then mounted on glass slides with VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed with an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope. In any given experiment, all pictures were identically exposed and processed. The ability of SAA to function as a ligand for the HDL receptor SR-BI was tested using rHDL. rHDL containing palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine was prepared as this phospholipid is not a ligand for SR-BI (23Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that 125I-labeled recombinant human SAA1 in reconstituted particles (SAA-rHDL) exhibited receptor-specific, saturable, and high affinity binding (Kd = 17 ± 1.3 μg/ml) at 4 °C to SR-BI expressed in CHO cells. Apo-AI in reconstituted particles (AI-rHDL) also functioned as a high affinity SR-BI ligand (Kd = 4.0 ± 0.4 μg/ml) as previously reported (21de Beer M.C. Durbin D.M. Cai L. Mirocha N. Jonas A. Webb N.R. van der de Beer F.C. Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15832-15839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The affinity of both SAA-rHDL and AI-rHDL was greater than the affinity observed for native HDL3 particles (Kd = 40 μg/ml, data not shown). Maximal binding of SAA-rHDL (Bmax = 2000 ± 63 μg/ml) was greater than that of AI-rHDL (Bmax = 792 ± 21 μg/ml). High affinity association to SR-BI was also observed at 37 °C for both SAA-rHDL (apparent Kd = 12.5 ± 1.2 μg/ml) and AI-rHDL (apparent Kd = 5.4 ± 0.7 μg/ml) (Fig. 2). At 37 °C, SAA-rHDL showed greater association with control CHO-A7 cells (15–30% of the value in CHO-SR-BI cells) than apoA-I, indicating that a component of SAA cell association in CHO cells was SR-BI-independent. As in the case of CHO-SR-BI cells, SAA-rHDL also showed high affinity association to HepG2 cells (data not shown). Relative to the amounts of cell-associated ligand in these experiments, only small amounts of apolipoprotein ligand were degraded during incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. A greater fraction of ligand degradation occurred in the case of SAA-rHDL (16% of cell-associated ligand) than for AI-rHDL (8% of cell-associated ligand). This indicated a greater degree of ligand internalization and degradation of SAA-rHDL compared with AI-rHDL (see also Fig. 3B).Fig. 1Binding of SAA-rHDL and AI-rHDL to SR-BI. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 125I-labeled SAA-rHDL and AI-rHDL as described under “Materials and Methods.” SR-BI-specific values are shown (solid lines) and are calculated as the difference between values for CHO-SR-BI cells and non-transfected CHO-A7 cells (dotted lines).

No significant cell association of ligands was observed in CHO-A7 cells (inserts).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of SAA to SR-BI was also investigated by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescently labeled apolipoproteins in rHDL. Both Alexa-labeled AI-rHDL and Alexa-labeled SAA-rHDL exhibited SR-BI-dependent cell surface binding to CHO-SR-BI cells at 4 °C, with little or no binding being observed in control CHO-A7 cells (Fig. 3, A and C, inserts). Similarly, at 37 °C, SR-BI-dependent cell association of both AI-rHDL and SAA-rHDL occurred (Fig. 3, B and D). In the case of AI-rHDL, ligand was most prominent at the cell surface, consistent with a mechanism in which SR-BI mediates HDL-selective uptake at the cell surface (24Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 25Peng Y. Akmentin W. Connelly M.A. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 14372-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Small punctate accumulations of ligand were also observed intracellularly. Interestingly, SAA-rHDL was observed not only at the cell surface but also in relatively large amounts in prominent intracellular punctate spots, demonstrating a markedly greater internalization and accumulation of the SAA-containing ligand compared with apoA-I-containing particles. We next addressed the question of whether the presence of SAA on HDL affects HDL binding and selective lipid uptake by SR-BI. The approach employed was to generate HDL enriched with mouse SAA (AdSAA-HDL) in mice through adenovirus-mediated gene transfer as described previously (17Webb N.R. van der de Beer M.C. Westhuyzen D.R. Kindy M.S. Banka C.L. Tsukamoto K. Rader D.L. de Beer F.C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1583-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition and apolipoprotein content of AdNull-HDL and Ad-SAA-HDL are shown in Fig. 4A and Table I. HDL from control mice (injected with AdNull, an adenoviral vector that does not express a protein product) contained no detectable SAA, whereas AdSAA-HDL contained significant amounts of SAA as is typical during an acute phase response (Fig. 4A). The composition of AdSAA-HDL was distinguished from control HDL by an elevated level of unesterified cholesterol (11.1 versus 6.0% by weight) and a decreased level of CE (7.6 versus 12.3% by weight). Phospholipid and protein contents of the two HDLs were similar. The reduced content of esterified cholesterol is likely due in part to the known inhibitory effect of SAA on lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity (9Tam S.P. Flexman A. Hulme J. Kisilevsky R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1410-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Khovidhunkit W. Shigenaga J.K. Moser A.H. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. J.

The association of double labeled 125I-/[3H]CE-AdSAA-HDL and AdNull-HDL to SR-BI were similar, with AdSAA-HDL showing slightly greater association only at the higher ligand concentrations examined (Fig. 4B). Selective CE uptake was also examined for the two ligands. Selective uptake from AdSAA-HDL was found to be 30–50% less than that observed for AdNull-HDL. These results indicated that the presence of SAA on HDL negatively influences selective lipid uptake from HDL, despite increased cell association of the ligand.Table IComposition of AdNull-HDL and AdSAA-HDL Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry. Free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol ester (CE), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) were determined enzymatically using commercially available kits (WAKO Chemicals, Richmond VA).

Given the fact that SAA is secreted in relatively large amounts from hepatocytes likely in a lipid-free form during an acute phase response (29Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar), we investigated whether lipid-free SAA binds to SR-BI and whether such binding influences HDL binding and selective lipid uptake by SR-BI. Similar to SAA-rHDL, Alexa-labeled lipid-free SAA bound specifically at 4 °C to SR-BI at the cell surface of CHO-SR-BI cells (Fig. 5C), with little binding being observed in the untransfected CHO-A7 cells (Fig. 5C, insert). SR-BI-specific cell surface binding at 4 °C was also seen in the case of lipid-free apoA-I (Fig. 5A). Lipid-free SAA was internalized at 37 °C by CHO cells in an SR-BI-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). In contrast, lipid-free apoA-I showed little internalization at 37 °C with the large bulk of cell-associated fluorescent apolipoprotein being bound to the cell surface (Fig. 5B).

AR is believed to recruit unique coactivators to its LBD using an aromatic-rich motif (FXXLF) while recruiting SRCs to its N-terminal domain (NTD) through an alternate mechanism. Here, we report that the AR-LBD interacts with both FXXLF motifs and a subset of LXXLL motifs and that contacts with these LXXLL motifs are both necessary and sufficient for SRC-mediated AR regulation of transcription. Crystal structures of the activated AR in complex with both recruitment motifs reveal that side chains unique to the AR-LBD rearrange to bind either the bulky FXXLF motifs or the more compact LXXLL motifs and that AR utilizes subsidiary contacts with LXXLL flanking sequences to discriminate between LXXLL motifs.

Chang C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). AR is absolutely required for normal male development, plays a variety of important roles in metabolism and homeostasis in adult men and women (2Liu P.Y. Death A.K. Handelsman D.J. Endocr.

(Paris). 2003; 64: 136PubMed Google Scholar), and is required for prostate cancer growth. Consequently, AR is a major target for pharmaceutical development and the recognized target for existing prostate cancer therapies, including androgen withdrawal and antiandrogens (1Lee H.J. Chang C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 4Gregory C.W. He B. Johnson R.T. Ford O.H. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M.

Huang H. Tindall D.J. Steroids. 2004; 69: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is nonetheless desirable to obtain new antiandrogens that spare patients from harmful side-effects and inhibit AR action in secondary hormone-resistant prostate cancer, where AR action becomes sensitized to low levels of androgens or existing antiandrogens (6Santos A.F. Huang H. Tindall D.J. Steroids. 2004; 69: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Balk S.P. Urology. 2002; 60 (discussion 138-139): 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Improved understanding of AR signaling pathways will facilitate development of these compounds.Like most nuclear receptors (NRs), AR activity depends on interactions with members of the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family (1Lee H.J. Chang C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol.

Several lines of evidence indicate that AR contacts with SRCs are important in prostate cancer. First, androgens promote SRC recruitment to the androgen-regulated prostate-specific antigen promoter, and this event is inhibited by the antiandrogen flutamide (10Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Second, exogenous SRC2 (GRIP1/TIF2) promotes the androgen-dependent progression from the G1 to S phase in LNCaP prostate tumor cells, in a manner that requires specific AR contact (10Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Third, SRCs often become expressed at high levels in prostate cancers (5Culig Z. Klocker H. Bartsch G. Hobisch A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2002; 9: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Finally, AR contacts with SRCs mediate hormone-independent AR signaling in conditions that resemble secondary prostate cancer (11Gregory C.W. Fei X. Ponguta L.A. He B. Bill H.M. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7119-7130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Blaszczyk N. Masri B.A. Mawji N.R. Ueda T. McAlinden G. Duncan C.P. Bruchovsky N. Schweikert H.U. Schnabel D. Jones E.C. Sadar M.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 1860-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, strategies to inhibit AR contacts with SRCs could be useful in blocking prostate cancer cell growth.For many NRs, overall transcriptional activity stems mostly from the hormone-dependent activation function (AF-2) within the NRs ligand binding domain (LBD), and involves interaction between a conserved hydrophobic cleft on the surface of the LBD and short leucine-rich hydrophobic motifs (NR boxes, consensus LXXLL motif) reiterated within each SRC (13Needham M. Raines S. McPheat J. Stacey C. Ellston J. Hoare S. Parker M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 72: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In contrast, current models of AR action suggest that AR activity stems from a potent hormone-independent activation function, AF-1, within the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR and emphasize the role of contacts between NTD and glutamine-rich sequences within the SRC C terminus in SRC recruitment (15Alen P.

Cancer. 2004; 11: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The AR-LBD is proposed to bind LXXLL motifs weakly and, instead, bind preferentially to aromatic-rich motifs that are found within the AR NTD (FQNLF and WHTLF) and AR-specific coactivators such as ARA70 (16He B. Lee L.W. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25631-25639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20He B. Minges J.T. Lee L.W. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The intramolecular interactions between the LBD and the NTD FQNLF motif promote formation of head to tail dimers (N-C interaction), which render the AF-2 surface unavailable for direct cofactor contacts (21He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 75: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Together, the notion that AR AF-2 binds coactivators weakly, and the fact that it will be occluded by the N-C interaction, has led to the suggestion that AR AF-2 does not play an active role in SRC recruitment.Nonetheless, several lines of evidence suggest that AR AF-2 can contribute directly to coactivator recruitment in some contexts. First, the N-C interaction is required for optimal AR activity at some promoters, including those of probasin, prostate-specific antigen, and C3, but not at others, including those of the sex-limiting protein and the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeats (MMTV-LTRs) (16He B. Lee L.W. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25631-25639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, AF-2 may be available for coactivator contacts in some circumstances. Second, mutation of AR AF-2 recognition sequences within target coactivators inhibits AR coactivation (16He B. Lee L.W. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25631-25639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Powell S.M. Christiaens V. Voulgaraki D. Waxman J. Claessens F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10226-10235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of FXXLF motifs within AR-specific coactivators such as ARA70 blocks their ability to interact with AR and potentiate AF-2 activity. More surprisingly, given the prevailing notion that AR AF-2 contacts with LXXLL motifs are weak, mutation of all three SRC LXXLL motifs inhibits AR coactivation when SRCs are overexpressed, when AR NTD FQNLF and WHTLF motifs are mutated, or when AR acts at promoters such as the MMTV-LTR.It is important to understand the overall significance of particular AR to coregulator contacts, and the mechanism of these interactions, to develop strategies to inhibit AR activity in prostate cancer. In this study, we examine AR AF-2 interactions with target coactivators. Our studies confirm that AR AF-2 binds FXXLF motifs, but also show that AR AF-2 binds a subset of SRC LXXLL motifs with higher affinity and, further, that the same LXXLL motifs are required to mediate AR AF-2 activity. Crystal structures of AR-LBD in complex with native FXXLF and LXXLL peptides reveal the structural basis for these unusual coactivator binding preferences and may suggest new approaches to drug design.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—AR-LBD (residues 663–919) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity using a modified version of previously published protocols (24Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Peixoto C. Macedo S. Otto N. Joschko S. Scholz P. Wegg A. Basler S. Schafer M. Egner U. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26164-26171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Bacterial cell preparations were grown at ambient or lower temperatures to high optical density at 600 nm (>1.00) in 2× LB supplemented with DHT. AR-LBD protein was expressed by induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 14–16 h at 15 °C before harvest and cell lysis by freeze-thawing and mild sonication. Purification involved an initial affinity chromatography step using a glutathione-Sepharose column, followed by thrombin cleavage of the GST affinity tag. Finally cation exchange chromatography with Sepharose SP afforded the purified protein. Our procedures differ from published work in that we use Sepharose SP for the second purification step instead of Fractogel SO3, which does not retain AR in our experiments.Peptide Library Synthesis—Coregulator peptides consisting of 20 amino acids with the general motif of C XXXXXXXL XX(L/A)(L/A)XXXXXXX were constructed, where C is cysteine, L is leucine, A is alanine, and X is any amino acid. The sequences of all the coregulator peptides were obtained from human isoform candidate genes (SRC1/AAC50305, SRC2/Q15596, SRC3/Q9Y6Q9, and ARA70/Q13772). The peptides were synthesized in parallel using standard Fmoc chemistry in 48-well synthesis blocks (FlexChem System, Robbins). Preloaded Wang (Novagen) resin was deprotected with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide. The next amino acid was then coupled using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (2.38 eq. wt.), Fmoc-protected amino acid (2.5 eq. wt.), and diisopropylethylamine (5 eq. wt.) in anhydrous dimethylformamide. Coupling efficiency was monitored by the Kaiser test. Synthesis then proceeded through a cycle of deprotection and coupling steps until the peptides were completely synthesized. The completed peptides were cleaved from the resin with concomitant side-chain deprotection (81% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% thioanisole, 2.5% ethanedithiol, 3% water, 2% dimethylsulfide, 1.5% ammonium iodide), and crude product was dried down using a SpeedVac (GeneVac). Reversed-phase chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/electrospray ionization) was used to purify the peptides. The purified peptides were then lyophilized. A thiol-reactive fluorophore, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (Molecular Probes), was then coupled to the N-terminal cysteine following the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled peptide was isolated using reversed-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry. Peptides were quantified using UV spectroscopy. Purity was assessed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.Peptide Binding Assay—Using a BiomekFX in the Center for Advanced Technology, AR-LBD was serially diluted from 100 μm to 0.002 μm in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing 150 μm ligand (dihydroxytestosterone) in 96-well plates. Then 10 μl of diluted protein was added to 10 μl of fluorescent coregulator peptide (20 nm) in 384-well plates yielding final protein concentrations of 50–0.001 μm and 10 nm fluorescent peptide concentration. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Binding was then measured using fluorescence polarization (excitation λ, 485 nm; emission λ, 530 nm) on an Analyst AD plate reader (Molecular Devices). Two independent experiments were assayed for each state in quadruplicate. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL), and the Kd values were obtained by fitting data to the equation, y = min + (max - min)/1 + (x/Kd)⁁Hillslope).GST Pull-down Assays—Full-length SRC-2 (amino acids 1–1462) and AR NTD-DBD (amino acids 1–660) was expressed in a coupled transcription/translation system (TnT, Promega). AR-LBD (amino acids 646–919), or AR-LBD mutants, were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 as a GST fusion protein and attached to glutathione beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Binding assays were performed by mixing glutathione-linked Sepharose beads containing 4 μg of GST fusion protein (estimated by Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent, Pierce) with 2 μl of 35S-labeled SRC-2 or AR NTD-DBD in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors containing to a final volume of 150 μl. The bead mix was shaken at 4 °C for 1.5 h, washed three times in 200 μl of binding buffer. The bound proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography.Cell Culture and Transfection Assays—HeLa, DU145, and CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H-21 4.5 g/liter glucose, containing 10% steroid depleted fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, cells were collected and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 ml/4.5 × 107 cells) containing 0.1% dextrose, and typically 4 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 1 μg of AR expression vector or empty vector control, and 2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. Cells were electroporated at 240 V and 960 microfarads, transferred to fresh media, and plated into 12-well plates. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C with androgen or vehicle, cells were collected, and pellets were lysed by addition of 150 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100.For transfections with full-length AR, the reporter gene utilized the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus promoter fused to luciferase. For transfections with GAL-AR-LBD, GAL-TR LBD, and GAL-CBP fusions, the reporter contained five GAL4 response elements upstream of a minimal promoter. LUC and β-galactosidase activities were measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and Galacto-Light Plus β-galactosidase reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The complexes of SRC2–2, SRC2–3, SRC3–2, and ARA70 peptides and AR-LBD were prepared by mixing at 0 °C for 2 h, with variable ratios of peptide (3–10 mm) and protein (at about 4.5 mg/ml). Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion methods (sitting-drop technique) using crystal screens from Hampton. The protein-peptide complex solution was mixed with the reservoir solution (0.8 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5 or pH 8.0), and concentrated against 300 μl of the reservoir. Crystals appeared after 1 day and grew to maximal dimensions after 4 days. After 4 days these crystals started to crack, so new crystallization trials were necessary to find additives that would stabilize the crystals. 0.3 μl of either 2.0 m NaCl, 1.0 m LiCl2, or 0.1 m EDTA were added to a 1-μl protein plus a -1-μl reservoir drop to stabilize AR-LBD crystals at room temperature.Crystals for either AR-DHT or AR-DHT-peptide were transferred to a new drop containing 10% (v/v) of glycerol for cryoprotection. The crystals were then flash-cooled using liquid nitrogen and measured using the synchrotron radiation at the 8.3.1 beam line at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley). Crystals containing SRC2-3, SRC2-2, and SRC3-2 diffracted to 2.07, 1.66, and 2.7 Å, respectively. Cocrystals of ARA70 peptide with AR-LBD were also grown, and a complete data set was obtained at 2.3 Å resolution. All the crystals belong to space group P212121 (orthorhombic) and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit.The diffraction data were integrated and scaled using the computer program ELVES (ucxray.berkeley.edu/~jamesh/elves/) (25Holton J. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement solutions for all AR-LBD peptide structures were obtained using rotation and translation functions from Crystallography & NMR Systems (CNS, cns.csb.yale.edu/v1.1/) (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).The first electron maps calculated after the rigid body refinement that followed the molecular replacement displayed clear electron density for the peptides. During the improvement of the protein model, the Fourier maps revealed better electron density for more flanking residues of the peptides. The electron density for the peptide was always modeled as a short α-helix. However, refinement of the SRC2-2 peptide as an α-helix was unsuccessful as such peptide does not adopt such helical conformation on the AR-LBD AF2 surface. Further SRC2-2 model building and refinement were not pursued as an α-helix. A composite omit map not including the peptides was calculated in the last steps of refinement for overcoming phase bias for each one of the complexes. This map was calculated omitting 5% of the total model allowing a better tracing of the peptide and permitted to visualize more residues that were not visible in the 2Fo - Fc map. Model building was done using the program QUANTA (Accelrys Software, www.accelrys.com/quanta/) monitored using the free R factor. Calculation of the electron density maps and crystallographic refinement was performed with CNS using the target parameters of Engh and Huber (27Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). Several cycles of model building, conjugate gradient minimization, and simulated annealing using CNS resulted in structures with good stereochemistry. A Ramachandran plot shows that most of the residues fall into the most favored or additionally favored regions.

Such peptides are known to bind to other NRs with equal affinity to the full-length coactivator (28Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). AR-LBD interacted to varying degrees with all of the peptides containing an LXXLL motif tested except the first NR box of ARA70. As expected, AR-LBD interacted with FXXLF sequences present in ARA70 and the AR NTD (21He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 75: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Bourguet W. Andry V. Iltis C. Klaholz B. Potier N. Van Dorsselaer A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) fairly strongly with measurable dissociation constants of 33 ± 3.3 and 38 ± 3.8 μm, respectively. Surprisingly, AR also recognized a subset of NR boxes from the SRC family (30He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2135-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Specifically, peptides of the first (SRC2-1, Kd = 13 ± 2.1 μm) and third (SRC2-3, Kd = 15 ± 1.2 μm) NR boxes of SRC-2 (GRIP1/TiF-2/N-CoA-2) bound strongly to AR, followed in affinity by FXXLF motifs. The second NR box of SRC3 (RAC3/p/CIP/p300/CBP-interacting protein) was also recruited to AR (Kd = 39 ± 5 μm). The remaining NR boxes from SRC-1, SRC-2, and NTD weakly interacted with AR either nonspecifically or with binding affinities above the assay range (>40 μm). Control experiments with the same sequences in which LXXLL or FXXLF had been converted to LXXAA or FXXAA revealed the binding was dependent upon the intact triad of hydrophobic amino acids (not shown). This substitution has been shown previously to abolish interactions with NR (31McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N.

Furthermore, AR-LBD interactions with SRC2 were inhibited by mutation of SRC2 boxes 2 and 3 (Fig. 1C), or by increasing concentrations of SRC2-3 peptide (Fig. 1D). Thus, AR-LBD binds FXXLF motifs but also binds a subset of classic NR box peptides with comparable or higher affinities. Moreover, the preference of AR for individual LXXLL motifs is different from that observed with other NRs, such as the estrogen receptor and thyroid receptors (TRs), which bind box 2 in each of the three SRCs with high affinity (28Darimont B.D.

As expected, a fusion protein containing the AR-LBD (amino acids 646–919) linked to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding function conferred androgen-dependent transcriptional activity on a GAL4-responsive reporter in several cell types, and simultaneous expression of SRC2 strongly enhanced AR AF-2 activity (Fig. 2A). Overall, AR AF-2 activity was more potent than that of AR AF-1 in HeLa and DU145, particularly in the presence of SRC2, and about 20–30% as potent as that induced by TR and estrogen receptorα LBDs, which bind a wider range of SRCs (see supplemental material). As expected from prior results, AF-1 dominates signaling in CV-1 cells, the effects of AF-1 and AF-2 are balanced in DU145 cells, and AF-2 dominates in HeLa cells (35Slagsvold T. Kraus I. Bentzen T.

Many SUMO substrates are involved in transcription and chromatin structure.

Analysis of this panel of SUMO substrates leads to the following observations. 1) Sumoylation is more efficient in vitro than in living cells. Polysumoylation occurs on several substrates in vitro. 2) SUMO isopeptidases have little substrate specificity. 3) The SUMO ligases, PIAS1 and PIASxβ, have broader substrate specificities than does PIASy. 4) Although SUMO1 and SUMO2 are equally efficiently conjugated to a given substrate in vitro, SUMO1 conjugation is more efficient in vivo. 5) Most SUMO substrates localize to the nucleus, and sumoylation does not generally affect their subcellular localization.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). SUMO1 consists of 101 amino acids and shares about 50% sequence identity with SUMO2/3 and 18% sequence identity with ubiquitin (2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Similar to the ubiquitin system (8Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar), conjugation of SUMO to substrate proteins is mediated by a cascade of enzymes, including SUMO isopeptidases (SENPs), SUMO-activating enzyme (a heterodimer of Aos1-Uba2), SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9), and SUMO ligases (1Muller S.

SUMO precursor proteins are processed by a SUMO protease, exposing diglycine motifs at their C termini. In an ATP-dependent reaction, the active site cysteine of Aos1-Uba2 forms a thioester with the C terminus of SUMO. Aos1-Uba2 transfers SUMO to the Ubc9 SUMO-conjugating enzyme again as a thioester. Ubc9 then transfers SUMO to the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue in the substrate, forming an isopeptide bond. Unlike ubiquitination, Ubc9 can catalyze efficient sumoylation of many substrates in the absence of SUMO ligases largely because of the ability of Ubc9 to directly recognize ΨKXE (Ψ, a hydrophobic residue; X, any residue) sumoylation consensus motifs on substrates (10Rodriguez M.S.

Several types of SUMO ligases have been identified, including the PIAS family of proteins (12Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), RanBP2 (13Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F.

Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these SUMO ligases exhibit distinct patterns of subcellular localization (6Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SUMO isopeptidases that function both in the maturation of SUMO precursors and in the removal of SUMO from modified substrates also exhibit distinct, defined patterns of subcellular localization. For instance, SENP1 resides in PML nuclear bodies (15Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). SENP2 localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope (16Hang J. Dasso M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19961-19966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). SENP3 is enriched in the nucleolus (17Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The distinct localization patterns of these SUMO ligases and isopeptidases suggest that sumoylation of a given substrate might be regulated by its localization within the cell. Numerous SUMO substrates have been identified either individually or through proteomic efforts (1Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53899-53902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, many transcription factors/cofactors and components of the chromatin remodeling complexes have been shown to be sumoylated (2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 3Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 4Muller S. Ledl A. Schmidt D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1998-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of transcription factors and cofactors inhibits transcription in some cases and activates transcription in others (2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 3Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 4Muller S. Ledl A. Schmidt D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1998-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The fact that sumoylation can affect the activity of transcription factors in seemingly opposite ways highlights the complex effects of sumoylation on protein functions. In contrast to ubiquitination, sumoylation of proteins does not generally target them for degradation. Instead, sumoylation appears to regulate the functions of the target proteins through several distinct yet not mutually exclusive mechanisms (1Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 2Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 3Seeler J.S. Dejean A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53899-53902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). First, sumoylation can affect the subcellular localization and trafficking of target proteins. For example, sumoylation of RanGAP1, a regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport and the first SUMO-conjugated protein identified, is required for its recruitment to the nuclear pore complex (18Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 19Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Second, by competing with ubiquitin for the same lysine residues as attachment sites, sumoylation can antagonize ubiquitination and stabilize its target proteins, such as IκB (20Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Third, attachment of the SUMO moiety to a target protein can create an additional surface for protein-protein interactions and enhance the binding between the SUMO target protein and its binding partner (19Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Therefore, sumoylation can regulate the function of its substrates in multiple ways. To gain insights into the general cellular function of sumoylation in mammals, we have used an in vitro expression cloning (IVEC) strategy to identify mammalian substrates of the sumoylation pathway (22Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P.E. Zon L.I. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our approach complements the recent proteomic efforts in identifying SUMO target proteins, which is limited by the low steady-state levels of sumoylated forms of proteins and is further biased by the relative abundance of substrate proteins in cells (23Zhou W.

Many of these substrates are involved in transcription, RNA processing, maintenance of genome integrity, and chromatin remodeling. We have confirmed the sumoylation of 24 substrates in living cells. Using this panel of substrates, we have investigated the extent of polysumoylation of substrates, the conjugation selectivity of SUMO1 and SUMO2, and the specificities of SUMO isopeptidases and ligases. We have also systematically analyzed the effect of sumoylation on the subcellular localization of target proteins. Our study represents an important first step toward the understanding of the mechanism and function of sumoylation in mammalian cells. Plasmids—The coding regions of SUMO1 (1-97), SUMO2, PIASy, SENP1, SENP2, and SENP3 were amplified from human fetal thymus cDNA library (BD Biosciences) by PCR. Full-length cDNA encoding the SUMO substrates identified in the IVEC screen (see below) were amplified either directly from the original clone (if the clone contained the entire open reading frame) or from human brain or fetal thymus cDNA libraries (BD Biosciences). The PCR products were digested and ligated into pCS2 mammalian expression vectors containing N-terminal Myc, HA, or GFP tags. Ubc9 was also cloned into a pCS2 vector containing a C-terminal FLAG tag. The SUMO1 ΔGG, SUMO1 KØ mutant, the dominant-negative Ubc9 mutant, SAP130 K785R, SAP130 K869R, and SAP130 K923R were constructed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Qiagen). The pET11c-hAos1, pET28b-hUba2, and pET28b-hUbc9 vectors were gifts from C. Lima and K. Orth. The pGEX-ScUlp1 vector was obtained from M. Hochstrasser. The pGEX-PIASxβ and pGEX-PIAS1 vectors were provided by S. Muller. The Topo IIβ vector was a gift from L. Liu. Protein Expression and Purification—DNA fragments encoding the wild-type or KØ mutant of His6-SUMO1 and the wild-type His6-SUMO2 were subcloned into pET28a. These proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads per the manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen). Ubc9 was expressed and purified similarly. For the expression of Aos1-Uba2, pET11c-hAos1 and pET28b-hUba2 were co-transformed into BL21(DE3). The resulting Aos1-Uba2 complex was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the excess amount of Aos1. The pGEX-ScUlp1 vector was transformed into BL21. The resulting GST-Ulp1 protein was purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). All proteins were concentrated to between 1-5 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. IVEC and Sumoylation Assays—Five 96-well plates with 100 cDNAs per well of a human adult brain library (Promega) were used in the IVEC screen for SUMO1 substrates per the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, 1 μl of DNA was in vitro transcribed and translated in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine and subjected to in vitro sumoylation reactions, which contained 2 μl of in vitro transcribed and translated product, 2 μg of Aos1-Uba2, 0.5 μg of Ubc9, 1 μg of SUMO1, and 1 μl of energy mix (150 mm phosphocreatine, 20 mm ATP, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, adjusted pH to 7.7). Reactions were adjusted to a final volume of 10 μl with the XB buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 50 mm sucrose). Control reactions contained water and XB buffer. After 2 h at 30 °C, reactions were stopped with 10 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Positive pools were transformed into DH5α. A total of 96 individual clones per positive pool were picked and cultured overnight in LB/AMP medium on 96-well plates. Aliquots of cultures in each row and each column of these 96-well plates were combined separately. Plasmids were isolated from these cultures and tested in the sumoylation assay as described above. Positive clones were identified and sequenced. The SUMO1 conjugation efficiency of each substrate was quantified using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). All other in vitro sumoylation reactions were performed similarly. Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa Tet-on cells (BD Biosciences) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Plasmid transfections were performed at 30-60% confluency in 6-well plates using the Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols (Qiagen). The small interfering RNA oligonucleotides against SENP1 and SENP2 were chemically synthesized at an in-house facility, and their sense strands contained the following sequences: 5′-CAGCUGUCCCACAGUGUAUTT-3′ (SENP1) and 5′-GCCCAUGGUAACUUCUGCUTT-3′ (SENP2). The annealing and transfection of the small interfering RNAs were performed using the Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as described (29Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24-48 h post-transfection. The cell pellets were solubilized by the addition of 200 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, briefly sonicated, and boiled. For each sample, 15 μl of lysate was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to Western blotting. Immunofluorescence—HeLa Tet-on cells transfected with various plasmids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeablized with 0.1% Triton-X100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1 μg/ml of anti-Myc (9E10, Roche Applied Science) or anti-FLAG (Sigma). After washing, fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were added at 1:500 dilutions. The cells were again washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and viewed using a ×63 objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. Images were acquired using the Intelligent Imaging software and pseudo-colored in Adobe Photoshop. Identification of Human SUMO1 Substrates by IVEC—Since the discovery of SUMO in 1996, on a case by case basis, many proteins with diverse cellular functions have been shown to be modified by SUMO (1Muller S.

In addition, several recent proteomic studies have utilized the affinity purification of tagged SUMO followed by mass spectrometry to identify new in vivo sumoylation substrates in budding yeast and mammalian cells (23Zhou W.

However, relatively few mammalian SUMO substrates have been identified in two such efforts, presumably because of the dynamic nature of sumoylation and desumoylation and the low steady-state levels of SUMO conjugates (24Zhao Y.

As an alternative, we carried out an IVEC screen to identify SUMO1 substrates from a human brain cDNA plasmid library (22Lustig K.D. Stukenberg P.T. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Cryns V.L. Mead P.E. Zon L.I. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We screened about 48,000 independent cDNA clones (five 96-well plates with ∼100 cDNAs per well). However, because of potential redundancy and poor expression of certain clones in the library, the total number of genes screened is estimated to be ∼10,000. To illustrate the strategy of our screen, the identification of two substrates, STAF65γ and ETV1, is shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, the pools of cDNA plasmids were in vitro translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. These 35S-labeled proteins were incubated in the absence or presence of purified recombinant Aos1-Uba2, Ubc9, SUMO1, and ATP. The samples were then resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In the C5 well of plate B and the E5 well of plate E, we observed additional up-shifted bands in the presence of the sumoylation reaction mixture (Fig. 1, A and B). A secondary screen was carried out to identify the SUMO1 substrates within these two wells as STAF65γ and ETV1, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). The appearance of these up-shifted bands in both cases required the presence of all necessary sumoylation components, such as SUMO1, Aos1-Uba2, and Ubc9 (Fig. 2A). Addition of Ulp1 (30Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), a yeast SUMO isopeptidase, to the reaction mixtures greatly reduced the intensities of these up-shifted bands (Fig. 2A). These results confirm that STAF65γ and ETV1 are efficiently sumoylated in vitro.Fig. 2Efficient multi- and polysumoylation of SUMO1 substrates in vitro. A, confirmation of STAF65γ and ETV1 as SUMO1 substrates in vitro. Plasmids encoding STAF65γ and ETV1 were transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with SUMO reaction mixtures containing the indicated components and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. B, polysumoylation of substrates in vitro. The indicated in vitro translated 35S-labeled substrates were subjected to either a control reaction (-) or a SUMO reaction containing either His6-SUMO1 WT (WT) or the His6-SUMO1 KØ mutant (KØ). The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. PIAS1 was used as a positive control for polysumoylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From the screen, we identified 40 human proteins that were sumoylated efficiently in vitro (Table I). Six of the 40 substrates identified in the screen, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M, topoisomerase IIβ, PML, SART1, similar to MGC25497, and TFII-I, are known SUMO substrates (24Zhao Y.

In this way, glycosaminoglycans are thought to participate in events such as development and wound repair. In particular, heparin and heparan sulfate have been well studied, and specific aspects of their structure dictate their participation in a variety of activities. In contrast, although dermatan sulfate participates in many of the same biological processes as heparin and heparan sulfate, the interactions of dermatan sulfate have been less well studied. Dermatan sulfate is abundant in the wound environment and binds and activates growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and FGF-7, which are present during the wound repair process. To determine the minimum size and sulfation content of active dermatan sulfate oligosaccharides, dermatan sulfate was first digested and then separated by size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography, and the activity to facilitate FGF-2 and FGF-7 was assayed by the cellular proliferation of cell lines expressing FGFR1 or FGFR2 IIIb. The minimum size required for the activation of FGF-2 was an octasaccharide and for FGF-7 a decasaccharide. Active fractions were rich in monosulfated, primarily 4-O-sulfated, disaccharides and iduronic acid. Increasing the sulfation to primarily 2/4-O-sulfated and 2/6-O-sulfated disaccharides did not increase activity. Cell proliferation decreased or was abolished with higher sulfated dermatan sulfate preparations. This indicated a preference for specific dermatan sulfate oligosaccharides capable of promoting FGF-2- and FGF-7-dependent cell proliferation. These data identify critical oligosaccharides that promote specific members of the FGF family that are important for wound repair and angiogenesis.

These data identify critical oligosaccharides that promote specific members of the FGF family that are important for wound repair and angiogenesis. Components of the extracellular matrix are broken down following injury or inflammation. These extracellular matrix products in turn participate in various phases of the wound repair process. Following injury, proteoglycans (PG) 1The abbreviations used are: PG, proteoglycan; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; DS, dermatan sulfate; GlcA, glucuronic acid; HS, heparan sulfate; CS, chondroitin sulfate; IdoUA, iduronic acid; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; MWCO, molecular weight cutoff; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are released and become soluble and abundant in fluids collected from wounds (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28116-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Dermatan sulfate (DS) is the most common GAG in the skin and is estimated to comprise between 36 and 78% of the total sulfated GAG in wound fluid samples (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28116-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). DS consists of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid (GlcA)-linked β1→4 and β1→3, respectively. Similar to modifications in heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) but distinct from the other chondroitin sulfates (CS), the GlcA of DS undergoes epimerization of the C-5 carbon, resulting in iduronic acid (IdoUA). In addition, sulfation modifications can occur at the 2-position of the uronic acid and at the 4- or 6-position of the N-acetylgalactosamine residue. GAGs and their PG core proteins participate in a variety of functions during wound healing, including binding multiple growth factors and promoting their activities (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T.

Of these activities, the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family has been shown to participate in several of the major steps, including inflammation, repair, and regeneration (9Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). FGF-2, also known as basic FGF, has been implicated in the recruitment of inflammatory cells during the inflammatory stage of wound healing. In addition, FGF-2 signals endothelial cell and fibroblast proliferation and may be involved in endothelial cell migration. FGF-7, or keratinocyte growth factor, contributes to epithelial cell regeneration. Studies suggest that FGF-7 can act in a paracrine fashion in which stromal cells release FGF-7, and the target epithelial cells express the FGF-7 receptor (25Werner S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). One of the most studied interactions occurs between FGF-2 and HS. It has been proposed (9Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) that HS binds FGF-2 on the cell surface, thereby protecting FGF from degradation and creating a reservoir of growth factor. It has also been shown (5Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that HS is required for the interaction of FGF-2 and its receptor. For HS and FGF-2, detailed work has described the sequence of HS required for FGF-2 binding and cellular activation. For binding and promoting FGF-2 activity, 2-O-sulfation and N-sulfation are required on the HS chain. In addition, the presence of iduronic acid is important for activity. The minimum oligosaccharide for binding FGF-2 is an octasaccharide, although longer oligosaccharides are required for promoting FGF-2 activity. These studies showed that the presence of specific sequences in HS is critical for activity with FGF-2. They further suggest that such sequences are not produced randomly but are generated as a consequence of the regulation of GAG-producing and GAG-modifying enzymes (6Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, limited work exists for sequence specificities for other types of GAGs, notably DS. Similar to heparin and HS, DS will bind and promote FGF-2- and FGF-7-dependent cellular proliferation (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M. Gallo R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These occur through the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway (7Trowbridge J.M. Rudisill J.A. Ron D. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using DS sources that varied in their size and sulfation patterns, it was found that the ability of DS to bind and activate FGF-7-dependent cell proliferation varies depending on the DS source (7Trowbridge J.M. Rudisill J.A. Ron D. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, because these DS preparations were heterogeneous and contained DS of various size and sulfation patterns, a determination of the specific sequence required for FGF-7 activation has yet to be elucidated. The present study set out to purify DS fractions based on their size and to determine what sequence specificities of DS are required to activate FGF-2- and FGF-7-dependent cell proliferation. The results identified a minimal size and indicated that active DS fractions contain primarily 4-O-sulfated disaccharides and a high degree of IdoUA residues. DS from porcine intestinal mucosa (DS-03122) was purchased from Celsus Laboratories, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). DS isolated from Styela plicata and Ascidia nigra was a generous gift from Mauro S. G.

Digestion—For large scale fraction preparations, 50 mg of lyophilized GAG was resuspended in 500 μl of chondroitinase AC digestion buffer (50 mm Tris and 60 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0) and 0.5 unit of chondroitinase AC. The digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 16 h, and then the preparation was boiled for 10 min to remove enzyme activity and filtered through a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for HPLC. The reaction was lyophilized down to a total of 200 μl, which were injected as two separate runs of 100 μl each. HPLC Purification—100-μl samples were injected and analyzed using a Superdex peptide HR 10 × 300-cm column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to an AKTA purifier HPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The run profile consisted of running 50 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 500-μl fractions were collected using an automatic fraction collector. The void volume eluted typically at fraction 15, with fractions of interest ranging from 17 to 35 before the total volume of the column was reached. Dialysis—Following fractionation, fractions were combined from the multiple runs and lyophilized down to a total volume of 500 μl. Fractions were dialyzed using a CE MWCO 500 or 1000 membrane at 4 °C in water, which was changed once daily for a total of 3 days. Samples were then lyophilized down to a pellet. Carbazole Assay—Quantification of uronic acid content by the carbazole assay was used to determine the final fraction concentration as described previously (12Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). 100 mg of GAG was first subjected to cation exchange using the Dowex 50 WX8 (Bio-Rad) to exchange the Na+ for H+, neutralized with pyridine, and lyophilized. The sample was then resuspended in two tubes, each consisting of 50 mg of GAG with 2 ml of 90% Me2SO, 10% H2O, and boiled for 6 h. The samples were then diluted to a total volume of 10 ml, and four PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) were used to desalt 2.5 ml of the desulfated GAG. Each column was eluted with 3.5 ml of 10% EtOH, and the samples were lyophilized. The desulfated GAGs were then subjected to digestion, HPLC purification, dialysis, and uronic acid analysis, as described above. BaF/KGFR cells were selected for 1 week in heparin and FGF-1 as described previously (7Trowbridge J.M. Rudisill J.A. Ron D. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Following selection, BaF/KGFR and F32 cells were expanded in T75 flasks and allowed to grow for 3 days before they were set up in an experiment. The growth medium consisted of RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (2.92 mg/ml), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), and 10% interleukin-3-conditioned medium. Before cells were used in an experiment, they were washed three times in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline to remove all traces of growth medium before seeding at a final concentration of 5000 cells/well. Experiments were set up in a 384-well plate (Costar, Fisher Scientific) with a total volume of 25 μl/well. If present, FGF-2 and FGF-7 at a final concentration of 5 ng/ml were added to the cells before seeding them in the plate. All dilutions of cells and GAG samples were carried out in non-conditioned medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin) that did not contain factors necessary for the cells to proliferate. Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C prior to performing a non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Individual fractions that had been separated as described above were verified by repeat analysis on the Superdex peptide HR 10 × 300-cm column. Then, portions of these fractions were resuspended in chondroitinase AC buffer (50 mm Tris, 60 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0) and digested with 250 milliunits of chondroitinase AC or resuspended in 15 μl of chondroitinase B buffer (50 mm Tris, 60 mm sodium acetate, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0) and digested with 1 unit of chondroitinase B. The digested fractions were then injected separately onto the same peptide column, and the analysis was repeated to determine product size. The Glycotechnology Core at the University of California, San Diego, performed all disaccharide analyses. The GAG samples were digested completely using chondroitinase ABC. The disaccharides were purified from the enzyme, and any large, undigested GAG samples were separated by a Millipore Microcon centrifugal filter device, using a MWCO 10,000 membrane (Fisher Scientific). The analysis and separation of the disaccharides was achieved by using reverse phase ion pair chromatography (C18 TosoHaas ODS-120T column, 4 μm particle size), with post-column derivatization based on the method described previously by Sakai et al.

FGF-dependent Cell Proliferation Requires a Minimum Size DS Oligosaccharide for Activation—In the presence of DS, FGF-2- and FGF-7 activate FGFR1 and FGFR2 IIIb, respectively, but the structure of the DS oligosaccharides necessary for this activation has not been defined. To determine the minimum DS oligosaccharide size required for promoting receptor activation, crude high molecular weight porcine DS preparations (primarily 4-O-sulfated) were partially digested with chondroitinase AC, cleaving the glucuronic acid bonds and producing DS oligosaccharides of various lengths. These oligosaccharides were then separated by size exclusion liquid chromatography, and the concentration of each size fraction was determined by carbazole assay. Each DS fraction (2 μm) was added to BaF/KGFR or F32 cells in the presence or absence of FGF-7 and FGF-2, respectively. BaF/KGFR cells express FGFR2 IIIb, and F32 cells express FGFR1. Both cell lines did not express cell surface GAG and were dependent on their respective FGF receptor for proliferation in the absence of interleukin-3. This analysis demonstrated that the smallest DS oligosaccharide sufficient to promote at least a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation with FGF-7 was a decasaccharide, although optimum activity was achieved with slightly longer oligomers (Fig. 1a). For FGF-2, octasaccharides of DS did have activity, although longer oligomers resulted in optimum activity (Fig. 1b). To verify that these observations were growth factor-dependent, FGF-blocking antibodies were used to inhibit FGF-dependent cell proliferation. Anti-human KGF/FGF-7 antibody blocked FGF-7-dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 1c), and anti-basic FGF antibody blocked FGF-2-dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 1d) to base line levels similar to GAG alone or to the growth factor alone (data not shown). 4-O-Sulfation of the DS Oligosaccharides Is Required for Promoting FGF-dependent Cell Proliferation—Previous work has shown that the degree of GAG sulfation and in some cases the specific sulfation sequence are critical for biological activity (4Lyon M.

To confirm that the sulfation of DS plays a role in the activation of FGF-dependent cellular proliferation, crude porcine DS was desulfated (18Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), digested, purified by size, and assayed as described for Fig. 1. Desulfated DS fractions of all sizes had no activity in promoting FGF-7- or FGF-2-dependent cell proliferation, compared with sulfated DS fractions (a 14-mer is shown in Fig. 2). It was next asked what type of sulfation is important for promoting FGF activity. Table I shows the types of DS used in the experiments, with their disaccharide sulfation content shown as a percentage of the total GAG. DS isolated from porcine intestinal mucosa and containing primarily (∼90%) 4-O-sulfated disaccharides was included in these experiments and used to make sulfated and desulfated fractions. Two types of DS isolated from Ascidiacea, S. plicata and A. nigra, with primarily disulfated disaccharides, 2/4-O- and 2/6-O-sulfated, respectively, were also evaluated (17Pavao M.S. Aiello K.R. Werneck C.C. Silva L.C. Valente A.P. Mulloy B. Colwell N.S. Tollefsen D.M. Mourao P.A. J. Biol.

In addition, disaccharide analysis was also performed on DS isolated from mouse and human wound fluid, which was shown previously to be active in promoting FGF-2- and FGF-7-dependent cell proliferation (1Penc S.F.

The sulfation content of wound fluid GAG was similar to that of the commercially available porcine intestinal DS. These reagents provided the opportunity to compare the activation of cellular proliferation by a primarily 4-O-sulfated DS, a DS containing 75% 2/4-O-sulfated disaccharides, and a DS containing almost 98% 2/6-O-sulfated disaccharides.Table ISulfation patterns of DS preparationsPigStyela plicataAscidia nigraMouse WFGAGHuman WFGAG%0-Sulfated1.41.0UD20.114.02-SulfatedUDUDUDUDUD4-Sulfated92.123.0UD77.959.06-SulfatedUDUD2.2UD25.52/4-Sulfated6.575.6UDUDUD2/6-SulfatedUDUD97.8UDUD4/6-SulfatedUDUDUD1.91.42/4/6-SulfatedUDUDUDUDUD Open table in a new tab Analysis of these DS preparations showed that the presence of primarily 4-O-sulfated DS had greater activity with FGF-7 than the more highly sulfated DS (Fig. 3a). 2/4-O-sulfated DS had very little activity, and 2/6-O-sulfated DS had a decrease compared with 4-O-sulfated DS. For FGF-2, the differences among 4-O-sulfated, 2/4-O-sulfated, and 2/6-O-sulfated DS were not as great as for FGF-7, although the more highly sulfated DS had slightly less activity than the 4-O-sulfated DS (Fig. 3b). The addition of highly sulfated DS to the 4-O-sulfated DS preparations did not inhibit activation of FGF-2 or FGF-7 (Fig. 3). Because heparin can also stimulate FGF-7- and FGF-2-dependent cell proliferation, it was imperative that activity resulting from the presence of heparin in the DS preparations be ruled out. Therefore, heparin contamination was determined in each DS preparation by disaccharide analysis. The concentration of heparin detected in a 2-μm porcine DS preparation was 0.011 μm. In independent experiments, the minimum concentration of heparin required to stimulate FGF-7-dependent cell proliferation was 0.013 μm, and this response was 20% of the response seen with DS. S. plicata DS had 0.016 μm heparin contamination in a DS preparation of 50 μg/ml, although this preparation did not stimulate the cells to proliferate. A. nigra DS contained 0.38 μm heparin in a DS preparation of 50 μg/ml. Because A. nigra contained heparin at a concentration that might confound interpretation of DS results, all DS samples were treated additionally with heparin lyases. Heparin lyase treatment did not abolish stimulation of FGF-7- or FGF-2-dependent cell proliferation by the DS preparations, although digestion with chondroitinase ABC cleaved both GlcA and IdoUA bonds and abolished activity (data not shown). IdoUA-rich DS Fractions Facilitate FGF-7-dependent Cell Proliferation—The content of IdoUA and GlcA in 4-O-sulfated DS was evaluated in preparations that were purified by size exclusion liquid chromatography to dodecasaccharides. This DS oligosaccharide was divided and digested separately with either chondroitinase AC to cleave GlcA bonds or chondroitinase B to cleave IdoUA bonds and then analyzed again by size exclusion liquid chromatography to determine what type of uronic acid was present in the DS dodecasaccharide. Digestion with chondroitinase AC resulted in the production of an 8-mer and a 4-mer (Fig. 4a, dashed line) from the original 12-mer fraction (Fig. 4a, solid line). When the 12-mer fraction (Fig. 4b, solid line) was digested with chondroitinase B, the resulting products were all disaccharides (Fig. 4b, dashed line). Previous data have suggested that crude preparations of DS but not CS A/C are able to bind and promote FGF-2 and FGF-7 activity (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M.

To further evaluate dependence on the IdoUA residue in purified DS or CS A/C oligosaccharides, both DS and CS were partially digested using chondroitinase AC and purified by size. An IdoUA-containing 14-mer derived from DS had greater activity in promoting FGF-7-dependent cell proliferation than did the CS-derived 14-mer (Fig. 5a). However, the DS 14-mer and the CS 14-mer at higher GAG concentrations had comparable activity in the activation of FGF-2-dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 5b). Additional digestion of the 14-mers with chondroitinase ABC eliminated FGF-7- and FGF-2-dependent proliferation. PG and in particular their GAG chains have the ability to participate in a wide variety of functions. They can act as structural components in the extracellular matrix or modify signaling information from a diverse number of soluble and cell surface molecules. In recent years, the specificity of some GAG interactions has been shown to depend on the size, particular sulfation patterns, and monosaccharide identity of the GAG chain, negating theories that GAG involvement is a nonspecific process. GAGs bind to and participate in the signaling of several different growth factors, including members of the FGF family. In detailed studies (5Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

The present study set out to determine the structural characteristics of the DS chain that are necessary and sufficient to promote FGF-2- and FGF-7-dependent cellular proliferation. Using cell lines engineered to express receptors selective for FGF-2 and FGF-7 and devoid of cell surface heparan sulfate, our data indicated that the minimum DS size requirement for FGF-2 was an octasaccharide and for FGF-7 a decasaccharide, although optimum activity was achieved with slightly larger oligosaccharides. Because these fractions were isolated based on size exclusion HPLC, each fraction collected was not completely homogenous. Each fraction contained primarily one size of DS but also contained some slightly larger and slightly smaller oligosaccharides. Therefore, size determination was an approximation. However, based on the total profile of size exclusion HPLC data and analysis after additional digestions, these fractions appeared to be most representative of the oligosaccharide length predicted by comparison to known standards. For example, the 12-mer DS fraction produced after chondroitinase digestion was composed of two size fractions, an 8-mer and a 4-mer. Both fractions contain all IdoUA residues because digestion with chondroitinase B resulted in only disaccharides. In addition, some DS 12-mers did not contain any GlcA residues but were composed of all IdoUA residues, as shown by digestion of the 12-mer with chondroitinase B. These data contradict some previous data showing that DS does not bind or activate FGF-2 (5Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the data confirm other reports (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M. Gallo R.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This may be explained partly by different DS sources containing various sizes and sulfation patterns. Sulfation of DS is critical for activity as shown by experiments in which DS was first desulfated and then fractionated and assayed by cell proliferation. Fractions lacking sulfation were not capable of inducing FGF-dependent cell proliferation. A highly monosulfated DS (90% 4-O-sulfated) was found to have activity in both FGF-2 and FGF-7 systems, but increasing the sulfation to primarily disulfated 2/4-O-sulfated DS did not increase activity. Unfortunately, because of limitations in the availability of some DS sources and the amounts of DS required to fractionate and purify DS oligosaccharides, smaller fractions of some DS and CS preparations were unable to be produced. This was the case for the 2/4-O-sulfated DS isolated from S. plicata. For these studies, experiments were limited to using crude, heterogeneous populations. Therefore, differences based on size might have been a factor in the interpretation of the data. The size of ascidian-derived GAGs may have been too large to act effectively. However, partially digesting without fractionating the crude 2/4-O-sulfated DS preparation did not result in increased activity, suggesting that inactivity was not because of size but the presence of specific 2/4-O-sulfation. The commercial sources of DS used in these experiments were of similar sulfation content, primarily 4-O-sulfated, as was the DS isolated from wound fluids. Some differences in sulfation content existed between the human and mouse samples, which may be partially accounted for by differences in collection; human wound fluid was collected from patients postoperatively, whereas mouse wound fluid was collected by inserting sterile tubing into the subcutaneous space of the mouse back. Significant differences in activity have not been seen to result from these preparations. To determine the IdoUA and GlcA content of the DS oligosaccharides, a DS fraction was digested by both chondroitinase AC and B. Chondroitinase AC treatment of a DS 12-mer, or dodecasaccharide, resulted in a peak corresponding to an octasaccharide and a tetrasaccharide, whereas treatment with chondroitinase B resulted in a peak corresponding only to a disaccharide. In Fig. 4b, the chondroitinase B enzyme and buffer and DS disaccharides had an overlapping retention time of 15.3. Because no original or resulting intermediate peaks appeared following digestion with chondroitinase B, it can be concluded that the majority of the uronic acids in the DS fractions were IdoUA. There appeared to be some GlcA present as shown in Fig. 4a, which suggests approximately one GlcA residue for every four to five IdoUA residues. The digestion of other fractions supports this conclusion; for example, the digestion of longer DS oligosaccharides resulted in three peaks corresponding to two GlcA residues within the chain (data not shown). In addition, these data argue that the fractions were relatively homogenous in size and uronic acid content. To determine whether the presence of the IdoUA residues in DS was critical to promoting FGF activity, the ability of CS preparations containing only GlcA residues was compared with DS. Consistent with previous reports, crude CS did not have much activity in either the FGF-2 or FGF-7 assay (1Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M. Gallo R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42815-42820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, fractionating CS into smaller oligosaccharides increased their activity in the FGF-2 system, although activity increased only slightly in the FGF-7 system. The CS preparation consisted of ∼4% unsulfated, 56% 4-O-sulfated, and 40% 6-O-sulfated CS disaccharides. FGF-7 preferred DS and therefore IdoUA residues at all concentrations of DS. Alternatively, FGF-2 preferred the IdoUA residues in DS at lower GAG concentrations, whereas at higher GAG concentrations both DS and CS had comparable activity in inducing FGF-2-dependent cell proliferation. Therefore, although the presence of IdoUA residues in the DS appears to be more critical for FGF-7 than for FGF-2 at higher concentrations, we cannot rule out that a more highly sulfated CS preparation, similar to the active DS (90% 4-O-sulfated), would have greater activity in the FGF assays. We also cannot rule out the presence of some DS contamination in the CS preparations. However, a similar experiment comparing crude DS and crude CS at varying concentrations revealed that CS had very little activity in either the FGF-7 or FGF-2 system at both low and higher GAG concentrations, indicating that size or an inhibitory fraction may be a factor in the observed results. Because heparin is active in FGF-7- and FGF-2-dependent cell proliferation, it was imperative that activity resulting from heparin contamination be ruled out. Although some small contamination of heparin was found in all preparations, the abundance necessary to stimulate proliferation was too low, and digestion with chondroitinase ABC but not heparin lyases resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation. Therefore, the contribution of heparin or HS contamination to the results discussed here was negligible. This study set out to determine DS sequence specificities that are critical to promoting the activity of FGF-2 and FGF-7. The presence of these growth factors is relevant to several events in the wound repair process. Following skin injury, DS becomes soluble and exists as a heterogeneous population of oligosaccharides in the wound. This investigation determined that DS oligosaccharides that can enable FGF-2 and FGF-7 activity are rich in 4-O-sulfation and IdoUA. The presence of more highly sulfated DS, specifically 2/4-O-sulfated DS or fragments smaller than octasaccharides and decasaccharides, does not promote FGF-2 and FGF-7 activity, respectively. This suggests that the modification of these elements in DS synthesis or breakdown could influence FGF activity. This, in turn, would influence the repair process. Future investigation into whether a change in GAG size, sulfation, or uronic acid content contributes to abnormalities seen in non-healing wounds will be of great interest in determining the factors that participate in these pathological events."

Consequently, it has only a marginal effect on eIF3·ternary complex interaction. Instead, the major inhibitory effect of mouse p56 is manifested at a different step of translation initiation, namely the binding of eIF4F to the 40 S ribosomal subunit·eIF3·ternary complex.

One of the key features of the innate immune response is the induction of numerous cellular genes in response to viral stress. Viral stress conditions in cells are triggered by mechanisms commonly associated with a cell undergoing viral infection, such as the production of double-stranded RNA, the production of interferons, as well as other virus-mediated pathways that have yet to be elucidated. Previous studies from our laboratory have characterized the human viral stress-inducible protein p56, a 56-kDa protein (1Guo J. Peters K.L. Sen G.C.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 is the largest of the 11 or more factors required for the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes. eIF3 is composed of 12 subunits named eIF3a to eIF3l, although the exact stoichiometry and arrangement of the subunits are poorly understood (5Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control of Gene Expression.

Finally, eIF3 is also involved in binding to eIF4G of the heterotrimeric eIF4F complex, stabilizing its association with the 43 S complex (10Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

The p56 family members share a structural homology consisting of a series of loosely conserved, 34-amino acid tetratricopeptide (TPR) tandem repeats (19Sikorski R.S. Boguski M.S. Goebl M. Hieter P. Cell. 1990; 60: 307-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). TPR motifs are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (20Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and these motifs have been shown to be required for the interaction between human p56 and eIF3e (21Guo J. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1892-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Conversely, the region of eIF3e that Hup56 interacts with is another loosely conserved structural motif known as the PCI motif. Named for Proteasome, COP9 signalosome and Initiation Factor, the three families of multi-subunit complexes that feature this motif, PCI motif-containing proteins, are potential target proteins for interaction with p56 family members based on structural homology (22Hoffman K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 204-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Three subunits of eIF3, “a,” “c,” and “e,” contain PCI motifs (23Asano K.

By extending the in vitro protein synthesis studies that showed that Hup56 can inhibit initiation of translation by interfering with eIF3 function, we followed a systematic investigation to reveal that all functions of eIF3 are not blocked by Hup56; it blocks only one specific step, namely the stabilization of the ternary complex of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi. Hup56 does not interfere with the interactions of eIF3 with 40 S ribosomal subunits or eIF4F. Because we are interested in studying the functions of the p56 family of proteins in interferon-infected animal models, we have extended our investigation to mouse (Mu)p56. Here we report that, like Hup56, Mup56 inhibited translation by binding to eIF3. However, unlike Hup56, it bound to the eIF3c (p110) subunit and not eIF3e. Consequently, Mup56 inhibited a function of eIF3 that is different from the one inhibited by Hup56. Constructs—The plasmid encoding full-length Hup56 was constructed by excising the full-length p56 cDNA from pBluescript KS(II) and inserting into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A full-length Mup56 plasmid for expression in mammalian cells was generated by PCR using an existing clone and then subcloning the cDNA sequence into Myc-pcDNA3. 2D. J. Hui, F. Terenzi, W. C. Merrick, and G. C. Sen, unpublished data. Its authenticity was confirmed by sequencing. This vector was generated by inserting six 30-nucleotide repeats of the c-Myc peptide in the N-terminal domain of the pcDNA3 expression vector. The construct encoding full-length Mup56 for expression in bacteria was generated by inserting the full-length cDNA for Mup56 into pET15b vector encoding a hexahistidine tag (Novagen). The full-length eIF3c construct was generated by reverse transcription-PCR and then inserting the cDNA sequence into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Kodak Scientific Imaging System). All constructs were confirmed by having the ligated junctions between vector and insert sequenced. Construction of a plasmid encoding full-length eIF3e was described previously (2Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The commercially available rabbit antibody (His Probe G-18) toward the His tag was used at a dilution of 1:666 for detection of the purified Mup56 in these studies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transfected Mup56 was detected by the c-Myc 9E10 antibody at a 1:1000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A polyclonal antibody raised in goat against purified rabbit eIF3 was also used in these studies. At a 1:1000 dilution, this antibody recognized primarily the p110 (eIF3c) subunit of eIF3 and other eIF3 subunits to a lesser extent (4Hui D.J. Bhasker C.R. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39477-39482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against Hup56 was used at a dilution of 1:2000 as described previously (2Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Mouse p56 from Escherichia coli— Mouse p56 was purified by following the same procedure described previously for purifying Hup56 (2Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, the BL21 DE3 pLys S strain of E. coli was transformed with the pET15b/Mup56 construct, and the expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h at room temperature. Mup56 was purified via nickel-affinity chromatography. Protein was then dialyzed against a high glycerol buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol) and stored at –20 °C. Initiation Factors—eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4F were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described previously (25Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of Radiolabeled eIF4F—Radiolabeled eIF4F was generated in vitro via reductive methylation using [14C]formaldehyde (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (27Yoder-Hill J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5566-5573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of Ribosomal Subunits—Free 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits were purified using high salt sucrose gradients as described previously (7Merrick W.C. Lubson N.H. Anderson W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2220-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Generation of [14C]Met-tRNAi—Radiolabeled Met-tRNAi was prepared by using Brewer's yeast tRNA (Ambion), E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and [14C]methionine (56 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (25Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In Vitro Translation Inhibition Assay—In vitro translations in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) were programmed with luciferase mRNA in the presence of [35S]methionine. In vitro translations were performed with nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. A typical 25-μl reaction contained 17.5 μl of lysate, 0.02 mm amino acid mixture (minus methionine), 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol), 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 0.5 μg of transcript. Purified Mouse p56 was added in increasing amounts as indicated in the figure legends. Translations were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 2 h. Following translation, a 5-μl aliquot of the reaction was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and incorporated radioactivity quantitated using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Four micrograms of each plasmid was transfected, and cells were harvested after 18 h. Cell lysates were prepared for either Western blots or immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged protein was performed in low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). M2 anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were pre-soaked with 3 μg of bovine serum albumin for 15 min. Cell lysates were prepared as described (28Leonard G.T. Sen G.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5095-5101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 300 μg of whole-cell extracts were mixed with 500 μl of low salt buffer and 20 μl of preincubated anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were washed with the low salt buffer and subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Western blots were performed with a 1:2000 dilution of a polyclonal p56 antibody (2Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Western blot for FLAG or Myc was performed using 1:2000 dilution of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak Scientific Imaging System) and 1:1000 dilution of c-Myc 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Alternatively, 300 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 6 μl of antibody against Myc (c-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C overnight. 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) was then added, followed by a 4-h incubation at 4 °C. Samples were washed four times with RIPA buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an antibody against FLAG (M2-monoclonal antibody, Sigma). Gel Filtration Chromatography—The gel filtration binding assay was performed as described previously (2Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, an XK 16/70 column (16 mm diameter, 70 cm long, column volume ∼100 ml, V0 ∼35 ml; Amersham Biosciences) was packed with Superdex 200 resin. The column was equilibrated with the assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol). Recombinant purified p56 protein (65 μg, ∼1160 pmol) was then separately incubated in the absence or presence of eIF3 (377 μg, ∼580 pmol) for 15 min at 30 °C. Samples were applied to the column, and separation was performed at 4 °C, with a flow rate 1 ml/min, using the Akta Design fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). One-milliliter fractions were collected after the 30-ml void volume had passed, and 25 μl of each even number fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then Western-blotted using the His antibody. In Vitro Pull Down—Eighteen picomoles of purified His-Mup56 and 9 pmol of purified eIF3 were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C prior to the addition of 10 μl of eIF3 antibody in a final volume of 500 μl of RIPA buffer. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein A-agarose was then added to the reaction followed by a 4-h incubation at 4 °C. Samples were washed four times with RIPA buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with an antibody against His (His-G18 polyclonal antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alternatively, 18 pmol of purified His-Mup56 and 9 mol of purified eIF3 were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h prior to the addition of 25 μl of washed nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in 400 μl of GF buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9,150 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100; 5% glycerol, 4 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors). Samples were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed four times with GF buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with eIF3 antibody. Ribosome Dissociation Assay—The ribosome dissociation assay was performed as described in Ref. 7Merrick W.C. Lubson N.H. Anderson W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2220-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar. Purified 40 S ribosomal subunits (0.7 A260 units) were incubated with 1.4 A260 units of purified 60 S ribosomal subunits to form 80 S ribosomes in a 100-μl reaction volume containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. To dissociate ribosomes, 60 pmol of eIF3 (37.5 μg, 600 nm) was added to the reaction, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, then layered on a 12-ml 10–25% sucrose gradient (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT), and centrifuged for 16 h at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C (Beckman SW28Ti rotor). To test the effect of Mup56, 60 pmol of purified p56 (3.2 μg, 600 nm) was preincubated with 60 pmol of eIF3 for 10 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of ribosomes. Gradients were unloaded via upward displacement using 60% sucrose, and UV absorbance was measured at 254 nm with an ISCO flow cell. For Western blot analysis of sucrose gradient fractions, 500 μl of each fraction was precipitated with a final concentration of 10% trichloroacetic acid, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore), and then probed with either eIF3 antibody (1:1000) or His antibody (1:666) as described previously (2Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). eIF3/eIF4F Interaction Assay—To observe the interaction of eIF3 and eIF4F, sucrose density centrifugation was performed as described in Ref. 27Yoder-Hill J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5566-5573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Radiolabeled [14C]eIF4F (150 pmol, 30 μg) was incubated alone or with equimolar (150 pmol, 100 μg) amounts of unlabeled eIF3 in a 100-μl volume containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Reactions were then layered on a 5–18% sucrose gradient (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and centrifuged at 32,000 rpm for 18.5 h at 4 °C (Beckman SW60 rotor). To test the effect of Mup56 on this interaction, purified Mup56 (150 pmol, 8.4 μg) was preincubated with eIF3 for 10 min at 30 °C prior to addition of 14C-labeled eIF4F. Gradients were unloaded via needle syringe and 1-ml fractions collected. The radioactivity in 200 μl of each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Ternary Complex Assay—Ternary complex formation was performed as described previously (29Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 108-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Purified eIF2 (8 pmol, 1.0 μg) was incubated with 10 pmol of [14C]Met-tRNAi and 100 μm GTP in a 100-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 1 mm DTT, 0.3 IU pyruvate kinase, and 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. To stimulate ternary complex formation, 30 pmol (20 μg) of purified eIF3 was also added to the reaction. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and then immediately quenched with 3 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (quenching buffer). Ternary complex was bound to the nitrocellulose filter (25 mm, 0.45-mm pore size, Millipore) by adding the entire reaction mixture to the filter, followed by vacuum filtration. Filters were washed twice with 5 ml of quenching buffer, followed by vacuum filtration. Filters were dried under a heat lamp, and radioactivity was then determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. To test the effect of Mup56 on ternary complex formation, 30 pmol (1.7 μg) of purified Mup56 was preincubated with eIF3 for 10 min at 30 °C prior to their addition to the ternary complex reaction mixture. Preinitiation Complex Sucrose Gradient Analysis—Sucrose gradients (10–25%) were prepared exactly as described previously for the ribosome dissociation assay except 100 μm GDPNP was included in the mixture (30Peterson D.T. Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty picomoles of eIF3 was preincubated either alone or with 30 pmol of mouse p56 for 15 min at 30 °C. One A260 unit of purified 40 S subunits was then added and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The ternary complex was formed separately as described previously in the ternary complex assay except amounts of 30 pmol of [14C]Met-tRNAi and 30 pmol of eIF2 (3.8 μg) were used. This reaction was added directly to the 40 S ribosome/eIF3 mixture. In some cases, where indicated, 30 pmol of radiolabeled 14C-labeled eIF4F was added to this reaction. Gradients were centrifuged for 16 h at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C (Beckman SW28Ti rotor) and unloaded via upward displacement using 60% sucrose, and UV absorbance was measured at 254 nm with an ISCO flow cell. Fractions were then directly measured for radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry or subjected to a 95 °C trichloroacetic acid precipitation step after fractionation in order to remove the contribution of the radiolabel in the [14C]Met-tRNAi. Precipitated protein was then collected on nitrocellulose filters (25 mm, 0.45-mm pore size, Millipore), and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Mouse p56 Inhibits Translation—Mup56 and Hup56 are similar sized proteins, although they have only 50% sequence identity. However, both proteins contain six TPR motifs that are similarly spaced (Fig. 1). These motifs are defined by typical patterns of small and large hydrophobic residues, although no residues are completely invariant. The sequences within the same TPR motifs of the two proteins are highly conserved. For example, of the 34 residues of TPR2, 23 residues are identical and 6 more are similar (Fig. 1). To examine the functions of Mup56, we expressed a hexahistidine-tagged recombinant Mup56 in E. coli, and we purified it by affinity chromatography on a nickel-agarose column. The purified protein was then tested for its ability to inhibit translation in vitro. For this purpose, increasing quantities of Mup56 or Hup56 were added to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system programmed with luciferase mRNA. Quantitation of the radiolabeled products revealed that both proteins inhibited translation in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, their potencies were similar: 50% inhibition was observed with about 50 nm concentration of each protein (Fig. 2). By having established that Mup56 is a potent inhibitor of translation, the underlying mechanism was further investigated.Fig. 2Recombinant Hup56 and Mup56 inhibit translation in vitro. Luciferase mRNA was translated by using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system containing [35S]methionine in the presence of dialysis buffer (0 nm) or 50, 200, 400, and 800 nm recombinant Hup56 (A) or Mup56 protein (B). Translated luciferase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Inhibition is shown as a percentage of the buffer control (100% translation). Experiment was performed in duplicate. Results are shown as a percentage of the maximal level of translation achieved (0 nm of protein added), ∼17,000 cpm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mup56 Binds to eIF3c—We first examined whether Mup56, like Hup56, binds to eIF3. Size fractionation analysis by gel filtration chromatography showed that Mup56 existed as dimers and monomers (Fig. 3A). In the presence of purified eIF3, a portion of Mup56 appeared in fractions that contained eIF3, indicating the binding of the two proteins (Fig. 3B). Similar to what was observed with Hup56 (2Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) some Mup56 also appeared in the intermediate fractions (Fig. 3B, fractions 24–32), probably due to partial dissociation of the eIF3·Mup56 complex during gel filtration. Binding of Mup56 to eIF3 was confirmed by pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4). When purified Mup56 and eIF3 were mixed in vitro, pulling down Mup56 by using its hexahistidine tag (Fig. 4A) or immunoprecipitation of eIF3 by its cognate antibody (Fig. 4B) resulted in co-purification of the associated partners (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 2). Appropriate controls (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1 and 3) showed that the binding was efficient and specific. Moreover, the Western blot with the whole eIF3 antibody showed that Mup56 appeared to bind specifically to the c subunit of the eIF3 complex (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Mup56 binds to eIF3 in vitro. Six micrograms of purified eIF3 was incubated alone or in the presence of 1 μg of His-Mup56, and pull-down or immunoprecipitation assays were performed. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. A, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was used to pull down Mup56, and Western blotting was with eIF3 antibody. Lane 1, input eIF3 without pull-down. Lane 2, eIF3 and Mup56 after pull-down. Lane 3, only eIF3 after pull-down. B, eIF3 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, and Western blot was performed with His antibody. Lane 1, input Mup56 without immunoprecipitation. Lane 2, Mup56 and eIF3 immunoprecipitated with the eIF3 antibody. Lane 3, Mup56 and eIF3 immunoprecipitated without the eIF3 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because Hup56 binds to the e subunit of eIF3, the above result was unexpected. Hence we carried out a series of experiments to examine the specificities of in vivo interactions between p56 proteins and eIF3c/eIF3e subunits (Fig. 5). For this purpose, Myc-tagged p56 proteins were expressed in human cells along with FLAG-tagged eIF3c or eIF3e. Each partner was immunoprecipitated or affinity-purified from the cell lysates, and the presence of the other partner in the precipitate was detected by Western blotting. The levels of expression of the transfected proteins and endogenous actin were measured by straight Western blotting of cell lysates with appropriate antibodies. When Mup56 was pulled down, eIF3c co-purified with it (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Similarly, when eIF3c was immunoprecipitated, Mup56 was bound to it (Fig. 5B, lane 2) but Hup56 was not (Fig. 5B, lane 3). When eIF3e and p56 were co-expressed and eIF3e was immunoprecipitated, Hup56 interacted with it (Fig. 5C, lane 2) but Mup56 did not (Fig. 5C, lane 4). These results clearly showed that in vivo Mup56 and Hup56 specifically bound to the c and the e subunits of eIF3, respectively. Both these proteins contain the PCI domain and predicted nuclear localization signals (Fig. 5D). Mup56 Does Not Inhibit Several Functions of eIF3—We have shown previously that the inhibitory effect of Hup56 on translation initiation is primarily mediated by its ability to block the role of eIF3 in the stabilization of the eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex.

Although Mock-transfected K562 cells underwent megakaryocytic differentiation in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), estradiol-activated Notch1/ER induced apoptosis during TPA treatment in the transfectant, which was accompanied by the reduced expression of an antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-XL. Even when apoptosis was prevented by the overexpression of Bcl-XL, activated Notch signals still inhibited TPA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. As for this mechanism, Notch1/recombination signal binding protein J-κ-induced HES1 but not HES5 was found to inhibit the function of an erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage-specific transcription factor GATA-1. Although HES1 did not affect the DNA binding activity of GATA-1 in gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, it directly bound to GATA-1 and dissociated a critical transcriptional cofactor, p300, from GATA-1. Furthermore, overexpressed HES1 inhibited the development of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells in colony assays. Also, the Notch ligand Jagged1 expressed on NIH3T3 cells suppressed the development of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells from cocultured Lin-Sca-1+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These results suggest that Notch1 inhibits the development of erythroid/megakaryocytic cells by suppressing GATA-1 activity through HES1.

Notch family genes play a key role in determining cell fate in several systems, including muscle, nervous, immune, and hematopoietic systems (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). To date, four human Notch genes have been identified and all are expressed on hematopoietic cells (2Larsson C. Lardelli M. White I. Lendahl U. Genomics. 1994; 24: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Also, three human Notch ligands, Delta, Jagged1, and Jagged2, were identified, and all were shown to bind at least to Notch1 and Notch2 (3Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M.

Notch1-/- mice are embryonically lethal because of the defects in angiogenic vascular remodeling (5Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R. Nature. 2000; 405: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and the conditional inactivation of the Notch1 gene leads to the blockage of T-cell development and ectopic B-cell development in thymus (6Radtke F. Wilson A. Stark G. Bauer M. van Meerwijk J. MacDonald H.R. Aguet M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Similarly, Notch2-/- mice die during gestation. Also, conditional knock-out mice for Notch2 exhibit the defect in the development of marginal zone B-cell (7Saito T. Chiba S. Ichikawa M. Kunisato A.

Meanwhile, the activation of Notch induces the in vitro expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSC, hematopoietin stem cell; GPA, glycophorin A; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; ED, estradiol; 4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; ES, embryonic stem; Ab, antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type; MT, mutated type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IL, interleukin; EBL, erythroblast; SCF, stem cell factor; EPO, erythropoietin; TPO, thrombopoietin.1The abbreviations used are: HSC, hematopoietin stem cell; GPA, glycophorin A; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; ED, estradiol; 4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; ES, embryonic stem; Ab, antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type; MT, mutated type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IL, interleukin; EBL, erythroblast; SCF, stem cell factor; EPO, erythropoietin; TPO, thrombopoietin.

Med. 2000; 6: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Notch ligands Delta, Jagged1, and Jagged2 inhibit differentiation of HSCs (11Varnum-Finney B. Purton L.E. Yu M. Brashem-Stein C. Flowers D. Staats S. Moore K.A. Le Roux I. Mann R. Gray G. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Bernstein I.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 4084-4091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Carlesso N. Aster J.C.

Blood. 1998; 92: 1505-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These lines of evidence indicate that Notch signals keep HSCs in an undifferentiated state and induce their self-renewal. Upon ligand binding, the intracellular Notch is cleaved and translocated into the nucleus (14Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) and forms a complex with RBPJ-κ, which is also called CBF1. Although RBPJ-κ acts as a transcription repressor on a specific DNA sequence, intracellular Notch-bound RBPJ-κ turns into a transcription activator and initiates the transcription of target genes such as HES (hairy and enhancer of split) (15Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The HES family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors consist of six members, among which only HES1 and HES5 are involved in Notch signaling (16Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HES factors form homodimers and bind to the N-box sequence (CACNAG), where they repress transcription by recruiting the transcription corepressor, TLE (transducin-like enhancer of split) (17Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Also, HES1 inhibits the function of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors MASH1 and MyoD, which play central roles in myogenesis and neurogenesis, respectively, by depriving them of the heterodimeric partner E47 (18Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). HES1 and HES5 are expressed in neuronal stem cells and inhibit their differentiation (16Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 20Kageyama R. Ishibashi M. Takebayashi K. Tomita K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In accord with these findings, HES1-/- mice display severe neural tube defects because of the precocious neuronal differentiation and die before or immediately after birth (21Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Regarding the roles for HES1 in hematopoiesis, HES1 is essential for the in vivo expansion of early T-cell precursors, and over 90% of HES1-/- mice lack the thymus (22Tomita K. Hattori M. Nakamura E. Nakanishi S. Minato N. Kageyama R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of HES1 inhibits the maturation of B-cells by disrupting E2A activity (23Kawamata S. Du C. Li K. Lavau C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3855-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like activated Notch 1, overexpressed HES1 enhances growth and inhibits differentiation in a myeloid cell line 32D cultured with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (24Tan-Pertel H.T. Walker L. Browning D. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Gasson J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4428-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HES1 not only preserved the long term reconstituting activity of HSCs in vitro but also accumulated side population cells in vivo (25Kunisato A. Chiba S. Nakagami-Yamaguchi E. Kumano K. Saito T. Masuda S. Yamaguchi T. Osawa M. Kageyama R. Nakauchi H. Nishikawa M. Hirai H. Blood. 2003; 101: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These results indicate that, like activated Notch1, HES1 would prevent HSCs from differentiation. GATA-1 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors, which includes six members (GATA-1–6). These factors bind to a DNA sequence called a GATA motif (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the regulatory region of their target genes through two zinc finger domains. The carboxyl-terminal finger is required for the DNA binding, whereas the amino-terminal finger stabilizes the DNA binding and confers full specificity (26Trainor C.D. Omichinski J.G. Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Also, these zinc fingers are utilized for the binding to other nuclear factors such as, FOG1, p300S/CBP, PU.1, c-Myb, and LMO-2, all of which crucially regulate GATA activity positively or negatively (27Tsang A.P.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GATA-1 is expressed in erythroid cells, mast cells, and megakaryocytes at high levels and in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells at lower levels. GATA-1 is essential for primitive and definitive erythropoiesis, because GATA-1 null cells did not contribute to erythropoiesis in chimeric mice generated from GATA-1-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells (31Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In addition, the in vitro experiments showed that GATA-1-/- ES cells were unable to differentiate into mature erythroid cells because of apoptosis (32Simon M.C. Pevny L. Wiles M.V. Keller G. Costantini F. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 33Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 34Pevny L. Lin C.S. D'Agati V. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Development. 1995; 121: 163-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, lineage-selective GATA-1 knock-down mice exhibited striking thrombocytopenia as well as severe anemia (35Takahashi S. Onodera K. Motohashi H. Suwabe N. Hayashi N. Yanai N. Nabesima Y. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12611-12615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). These results imply that GATA-1 plays an essential role in erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Although both Notch1 and HES1 keep HSCs undifferentiated and induce their self-renewal both in vitro and in vivo (10Varnum-Finney B. Xu L. Brashem-Stein C. Nourigat C. Flowers D. Bakkour S. Pear W.S. Bernstein I.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), their precise mechanism remains largely unknown. Because the fate of hematopoietic cells is crucially regulated by lineage-specific transcription factors, in this study, we examined the effects of Notch1 and HES1 on GATA-1 and found that the Notch1-induced HES1 inhibited GATA-1 activity. These results indicate that Notch1/HES1 would keep HSCs undifferentiated, at least partly, by suppressing the function of GATA-1. Reagents and Antibodies—The antibodies (Abs) against GATA-1 (N-6 and C-20), p300 (C-20), and histone deacetyltransferase 5 (H-74) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-acetyl lysine, anti-HA, and anti-FLAG Abs were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Roche Applied Science, and Sigma, respectively. The Abs against Notch1, CD117, Ter119, CD45, and CD41 for flow cytometirc analyses were purchased from Becton Dickinson Biosciences. The Ab against glycophorin A (GPA) was purchased from DAKO. Plasmids Constructs—The expression vectors for the activated form of Notch1 (Notch1-IC) and Notch1/ER were gifted from Dr. D. W. Bornkamm (GSF-National Research Center for Environment Health, Munich, Germany); RBP-VP16 was from Dr. E. Manet (Unite de Virologie Humaine, Lyon, France); HES1 and HES5 were from Dr. R. Kageyama (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan); p300 was from Dr. J. Boyes (The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK); and Jagged1 was from Dr. G. Weinmaster (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). The expression vectors for HA-tagged GATA-1 and GATA-1/ERT were described previously (37Matsumura I. Kawasaki A. Tanaka H. Sonoyama J. Ezoe S. Minegishi N. Nakajima K. Yamamoto M. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2440-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Heyworth C. Gale K. Dexter M. May G. Enver T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1847-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). GATA-1ΔN90 lacking the N-terminal 90 amino acids was generated using the PCR method and subcloned into pcDNA3-HA (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Preparation of Stable Transformants from K562 Cells—NIH3T3, C3H10T1/2, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Flow). K562 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Nakarai Tesque) containing 10% FBS. To stably introduce the expression vector into K562 cells, we transfected 30 μg of the plasmid by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarad) (Bio-Rad). After the selection with an appropriate reagent (1.0 mg/ml of G418, 1.0 μg/ml of puromycin, or 0.5 mg/ml of hygromycin), several single clones in which transgenes were intensely expressed were selected from each transformant and subjected to further analyses. The OP9 System to Develop Hematopoietic Cells from ES Cells— E14tg2a ES cells and OP9 stromal cells were maintained as described previously (39Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1994; 265: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 40Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). To induce differentiation toward hematopoietic cells, ES cells were deprived of leukemia inhibitory factor and seeded onto confluent OP9 cells on six-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS. After 4.5 days, Flk-1+ cells were purified by FACS sorting. The sorted cells were replated onto OP9 cells at a density of 105 cells/well of 6-well plates and cultured under the indicated conditions. Flow Cytometry—Surface phenotypes of the cultured cells was analyzed using FACSort (Beckon Dickinson). DNA content of the cultured cells was evaluated by staining with propidium iodide and analyzed using FACSort. Northern Blot Analysis—The procedures for the isolation of total cellular RNA and poly(A) RNA and for Northern blot were described previously (41Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from 1 × 105 cells using a Concert Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification System (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using a SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) with forward/reverse primer sets as follows: Notch1 (Z11886), 5′-TGTGACAGCCAGTGCAACTC-3′/5′-TGGCACTCTGGAAGCACTGC-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (M32599), 5′-CACCACCATGGAGAAGGCCGG G-3′/5′-GTGTAGCCCAAGATGCCCTTC A-3′. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The isolation of total cellular lysate, immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (41Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis Using 293T Cells—We transfected various genes into 293T cells using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (37Matsumura I. Kawasaki A. Tanaka H. Sonoyama J. Ezoe S. Minegishi N. Nakajima K. Yamamoto M. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2440-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular lysate was isolated after 36 h and subjected to the immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with appropriate Abs. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—The isolation of nuclear extract and EMSA were performed as described previously (42Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The sequence of the double-stranded wild type (WT) MαP probe to detect the GATA-1 binding is from the murine α1-globin promoter (5′-GGGCAACTGATAAGGATTCC-3′; the recognition site is underlined), and that of mutated type (MT) MαP is as follows: 5′-GGGCAACTAATGCGGATTCC-3′; the mutated recognition site is underlined. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed with a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cross-links were quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 125 mm. After the isolation of the nuclear extract, chromatin was sonicated for five 10-s pulses, with 2 min of ice incubation between pulses. After the sonication, GATA-1-DNA-binding complexes were immunoprecipitated with the anti-GATA-1 Ab (N-6 or C-20) or control rat IgG2. The immunoprecipitated DNA was eluted and subjected to the PCR analysis. According to the paper made by Horak et al. (43Horak C.E. Mahajan M.C. Luscombe N.M. Gerstein M. Weissman S.M. Snyder M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2924-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we utilized two primer sets, P1 and P2, to amplify the GATA-1-binding sites on the β-globin locus at 32989 and 33194 bp, and their sequences are as follows: P1, 5′-GGAAGATACTGATAAGTTGAC-3′/5′-TGGAAATCTGGCTTATTGGAG-3′ (32973–33241); and P2, 5′-CACCAGTCTCTGACACATTC-3′/5′-GGTAGATTATGACGTCAGAAAC-3′ (32746–33244). Also, we utilized two negative control primer sets, P3 and P4, which amplify the upstream and downstream locuses far enough to be sheared off from the target GATA-1-binding site by the sonication and their sequences are as follows: P3, 5′-AGGCTGGTACTGGGGTTTGTC-3′/5′-CAGATTGCTCATGTAGGACC-3′ (30026–31081); and P4, 5′-ATGGGTCATTTCACAGAGG-3′/5′-CTTGAAGTTCTCAGGATCCAC-3′ (34531–34967). After 30 cycles of the PCR reaction (94 °C for 30 s for denature, 55 °C for 30 s for annealing, and 72 °C for 30 s for extension), the PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and visualized with Sybergreen staining. Luciferase Assays—Luciferase assays were performed with a dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega) (41Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T, NIH3T3, or C3HT10T1/2 cells (2 × 105 cells seeded in a 60-mm dish) were transfected with 2 μg of a reporter gene for GATA-1, pGL3-MαP-Luc containing three tandem repeats of (3×) WT MαP (37Matsumura I. Kawasaki A. Tanaka H. Sonoyama J. Ezoe S. Minegishi N. Nakajima K. Yamamoto M. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2440-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 100 ng of pRL-CMV-Rluc, an expression vector of Renilla luciferase, together with various amounts (2–10 μg) of effector gene(s) using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. After 12 h, the cells were washed, cultured under the conditions indicated for 24 h, and then lysed in lysis buffer. In some experiments using GATA-1/ERT as an effector gene, the cells were cultured with or without 1 μm of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) for the last 12 h. Measurement of the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities was conducted using a luminometer LB96P (Berthold Japan). To perform luciferase assays in K562 cells, we transfected 5 μg of a reporter gene (pGL3-MαP-Luc or a control reporter gene containing 3× MT MαP, pGL3-MT-MαP-Luc) (37Matsumura I. Kawasaki A. Tanaka H. Sonoyama J. Ezoe S. Minegishi N. Nakajima K. Yamamoto M. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2000; 96: 2440-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) together with 1 μg of pRL-CMV-Rluc into 107 cells by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarad). After 36 h, the cells were lysed and measured for luciferase activity. The relative firefly luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing transfection efficiency according to the Renilla luciferase activity. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and similar results were obtained from at least three independent experiments. GST Pull-down Assays—The in vitro binding between GST-GATA-1 and 35S-labeled Notch1 or HES1 was examined as previously reported (44Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Machii T. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Conditioned Media Containing High Titer Retrovirus Particles—The conditioned media containing high titer retrovirus particles were prepared using an ecotropic packaging cell line Plat-E as described previously (45Ezoe S. Matsumura I. Nakata S. Gale K. Ishihara K. Minegishi N. Machii T. Kitamura T. Yamamoto M. Enver T. Kanakura Y. Blood. 2002; 100: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Retrovirus Transfection into Murine Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells—Bone marrow cells were harvested from 9–12-week-old Balb/c mice pretreated with 150 mg/kg of 5-FU for 2 days, and mononuclear cells were isolated using density gradient centrifugation. Lin-Sca-1+ cells were isolated from mononuclear cells with MACS (Miltenyl Biotec) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence of murine IL-3 (10 ng/ml), murine SCF (50 ng/ml), human FLT3 (10 ng/ml), and human IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. Then the cells were cultured with 10% volume of conditioned media containing high titer retrovirus and 8 mg/ml of polybrene. After 24 h, the cells were washed and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, the above described cytokines, and 1 mg/ml of G418 for 48 h. Colony Assays—Retrovirus-transduced 1×105 cells were cultured in the methylcellulose media containing 1 mg/ml of G418 and cytokine combinations as indicated in 35-mm dishes. The number of colonies was counted after 16 days. Cocultures of Murine Lin-Sca-1+ Cells with NIH3T3 Cells—We stably introduced an expression vector for Jagged1 or an empty vector into NIH3T3 cells; these clones were designated as NIH3T3/Jagged1 and NIH3T3/Mock, respectively. Murine Lin-Sca-1+ cells (1 × 104 cells) were cocultured with subconfluent NIH3T3/Jagged1 or NIH3T3/Mock cells in 22-mm dishes in the presence of human EPO (3 units/ml) and murine SCF (50 ng/ml) for 9 days or human TPO (50 ng/ml) and human IL-6 (50 ng/ml) for 5 days and then subjected to flow cytometric analyses. Activation of Notch1 Signals Does Not Influence the Growth but Changes the Surface Phenotype of K562 Cells—To examine the roles of Notch1 signals in hematopoietic cells, we stably expressed a constitutively activated form of Notch1 (Notch1-IC) and an estradiol (ED)-inducible form of Notch1 (Notch1/ER, a chimera consisting of the cytoplasmic domain of Notch1 fused to the estrogen receptor) (Fig. 1A, left panel) in a human erythroleukemia cell line K562; these clones were designated as K562/Notch1-IC and K562/Notch1/ER, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that although Notch1 mRNA was hardly detectable in Mock-transfected K562 cells, Notch1 IC and Notch1/ER transgenes were effectively expressed in the respective transfectants (Fig. 1A, right panel). Also, we did not detect the expression of Notch1 in K562/Mock cells with immunoblot and flow cytometric analyses (data not shown). Although this result was inconsistent with a previous paper reporting that Notch1 was expressed in K562 cells (46Lam L.T. Ronchini C. Norton J. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19676-19684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we speculated that the biological characteristics of our K562 cells would be somewhat different from those in other laboratories. As shown in Fig. 1B, the growth curve of K562/Notch1-IC was similar to that of K562/Mock. In addition, ED-activated Notch1 did not influence the growth of K562/Notch1/ER cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that the activation of the Notch1 signal does not influence the growth of K562 cells. To investigate whether the Notch1 signal influences the surface phenotype of K562 cells, we examined the expression of the erythroid marker, GPA, using flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, the GPA expression was considerably suppressed in K562/Notch1-IC cells. Similarly, ED-activated Notch1 suppressed the GPA expression in K562/Notch1/ER cells (Fig. 1C), whereas the ED treatment showed no effect in K562/Mock cells (data not shown). Similar results were obtained from at least three clones in each transformant. These results imply that activated Notch1 would suppress the erythroid phenotype in K562 cells. Activated Notch1 Causes Apoptosis in Coordination with TPA in K562 Cells—Because K562 cells are known to undergo megakaryocytic differentiation in response to TPA, we next analyzed whether activated Notch1 influences the biological properties of K562 cells. Like K562/Mock cells, ED-untreated K562/Notch1/ER cells underwent megakaryocytic differentiation in response to TPA after 48 h (data not shown and Fig. 1D). In contrast, ED-treated K562/Notch1/ER cells became small in size and possessed a condensed or fragmented nucleus, indicating apoptosis after being cultured with TPA (Fig. 1D). To clarify this mechanism, we analyzed the effects of the Notch1 signal on the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, in K562/Notch1/ER cells with Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Under the culture without ED, the expression of Bcl-XL declined gradually after the treatment with TPA in K562/Notch1/ER cells. On the other hand, the 12-h ED pretreatment substantially suppressed its expression even before the TPA treatment (at 0 h), which disappeared more rapidly and severely after the addition of TPA than in ED-untreated cells. In contrast,"
https://openalex.org/W2006975907,"The identities of signal transducer proteins that integrate histone hypoacetylation and transcriptional repression are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that THAP7, an uncharacterized member of the recently identified THAP (Thanatos-associated protein) family of proteins, is ubiquitously expressed, associates with chromatin, and represses transcription. THAP7 binds preferentially to hypoacetylated (un-, mono-, and diacetylated) histone H4 tails in vitro via its C-terminal 77 amino acids. Deletion of this domain, or treatment of cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA, which leads to histone hyperacetylation, partially disrupts THAP7/chromatin association in living cells. THAP7 coimmunoprecipitates with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and the nuclear hormone receptor corepressor (NCoR) and represses transcription as a Gal4 fusion protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that these corepressors are recruited to promoters in a THAP7 dependent manner and promote histone H3 hypoacetylation. The conserved THAP domain is a key determinant for full HDAC3 association in vitro, and both the THAP domain and the histone interaction domain are important for the repressive properties of THAP7. Full repression mediated by THAP7 is also dependent on NCoR expression. We hypothesize that THAP7 is a dual function repressor protein that actively targets deacetylation of histone H3 necessary to establish transcriptional repression and functions as a signal transducer of the repressive mark of hypoacetylated histone H4. This is the first demonstration of the transcriptional regulatory properties of a human THAP domain protein, and a critical identification of a potential transducer of the repressive signal of hypoacetylated histone H4 in higher eukaryotes.

This is the first demonstration of the transcriptional regulatory properties of a human THAP domain protein, and a critical identification of a potential transducer of the repressive signal of hypoacetylated histone H4 in higher eukaryotes. The dynamic nature of chromatin modification clearly remains at the core of the process of transcription. The acetylation of histone H3 and H4 tails is strongly associated with transcriptional activation, whereas hypoacetylated histones are a mark of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin (1Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 2Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, proteins that acetylate histones (histone acetyltransferases) are generally involved in transcriptional activation, whereas enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histones (histone deacetylases (HDACs)) 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; DBD, DNA binding domain; HID, histone interacting domain; INHAT, inhibitor of acetyltransferases; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TK, thymidine kinase; THAP, Thanatos-associated protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; luc, luciferase; TAF-Iα, template-activating factor-Iα; TAF-Iβ, template-activating factor-Iβ; TSA, trichostatin A. 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; DBD, DNA binding domain; HID, histone interacting domain; INHAT, inhibitor of acetyltransferases; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TK, thymidine kinase; THAP, Thanatos-associated protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; luc, luciferase; TAF-Iα, template-activating factor-Iα; TAF-Iβ, template-activating factor-Iβ; TSA, trichostatin A. function in transcriptional repression. In contrast, methylation of histone tails can have both positive and negative effects on transcription (3Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The number, variety, and interdependence of histone modifications has led to the histone code hypothesis that predicts that modifications acting in combinatorial or sequential fashion on histone tails specify unique downstream functions (4Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 5Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

More recently, a signaling network model of chromatin has been proposed that suggests that multiple chromatin modifications combine to confer bistability, robustness, and adaptability to transcriptional signaling networks (7Schreiber S.L. Bernstein B.E. Cell. 2002; 111: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Both models predict the existence of cellular proteins that would either bind or be released from histones based on their modification status. Consistent with both models, histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 recruits heterochromatin protein 1 (8Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar, 9Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar), which plays an essential role in the establishment and maintenance of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Acetylated histones can also serve as specific docking sites for proteins. Acetylated histone H3 and H4 are able to recruit bromodomain-containing proteins, including the chromatin remodeling enzymes Swi/Snf and the transcriptional coactivators TAF(II) 250 and GCN5 to localized regions of chromatin (10Agalioti T.

This is considered to be a critical mechanism whereby acetylated histones are translated into transcriptionally active domains. Histone acetylation also has proposed roles in addition to the signaling role, such as reducing higher order chromatin structure by neutralizing the positive charge on histone tails and preventing their association with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA and altered interaction with neighboring nucleosomes (16Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar, 17Luger K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Sir3 and Tup1 are two yeast proteins that specifically bind hypoacetylated histones and have been linked to transcriptional repression. In yeast, at telomeres and the silent mating-type loci, Sir2 functions along with Sir3, Sir4, and Rap1 to mediate silencing (18Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 19Moazed D. Kistler A. Axelrod A. Rine J. Johnson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sir3 interacts more efficiently with histone H4 tails that are hypoacetylated by Sir2 (21Carmen A.A. Milne L. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4778-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, the yeast corepressor Tup1 interacts directly with histone H3 and H4 tails via a domain that is also required for transcriptional repression (22Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This interaction is weakened by high levels of histone acetylation, suggesting a mechanism whereby repression can be relieved. The Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complex also interacts with class I histone deacetylases that are required for its function (23Watson A.D. Edmondson D.G. Bone J.R. Mukai Y. Yu Y. Du W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, however, the mechanisms whereby un- or hypoacetylated histones mediate transcriptional repression are largely unknown. We have previously shown that INHAT subunits pp32, TAF-Iα, and TAF-Iβ bind to histones and consequently prevent them from serving as substrates for the histone acetyltransferase coactivators p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor, a process we refer to as histone masking (24Seo S.-b.

Heo S. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recently we and others have shown that TAF-Iβ and pp32 associate with histone deacetylases and can bind to histone tails, but not if lysines are hyperacetylated, making them candidate human proteins that can translate the transcriptionally repressive marks of unacetylated histones (26Kutney S.N. Hong R. Macfarlan T. Chakravarti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30850-30855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Weise C. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23859-23862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this work we characterize THAP7, a novel human protein we isolated in an interaction screen with TAF-Iβ. This protein is a member of a large class of proteins containing the novel THAP domain, a C2-CH signature (Cys-Xaa2–4-Cys-Xaa35–50-Cys-Xaa2-His) zinc finger domain sharing significant similarity to the site-specific DNA binding domain of the Drosophila P element transposase (28Roussigne M. Kossida S. Lavigne A.C. Clouaire T. Ecochard V. Glories A. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 66-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There are 12 distinct human proteins that contain the THAP domain, and all share a similar N-terminal location of the domain as well as its size of ∼90 residues. To date, only two members of this family have been characterized; THAP0 (DAP4/p52rIPK), a protein that was isolated in a genetic screen for genes involved in interferon-γ-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (29Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and in a screen for activators of the interferon-induced protein kinase R (30Gale Jr., M. Blakely C.M. Hopkins D.A. Melville M.W. Wambach M. Romano P.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and THAP1, a protein that potentiates both serum withdrawal and tumor necrosis factor α-induced apoptosis (31Roussigne M. Cayrol C. Clouaire T. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2432-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila indicates that THAP domain proteins may have roles in chromatin-based processes, including transcription (28Roussigne M. Kossida S.

Sci. 2003; 28: 66-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Boxem M. van den Heuvel S. Curr.

Cell. 2004; 118: 439-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, no transcriptional regulatory properties of any member of the THAP domain family have been reported. Here we demonstrate that THAP7 binds to histones and nucleosomes in a tail-dependent manner and binds to histone H4 in an acetylation sensitive manner. Transfected THAP7 associates with chromatin in living cells and promoter-targeted THAP7 represses transcription of transiently transfected and chromosomally integrated reporters and associates with HDAC3 and NCoR. This is the first demonstration of chromatin targeting and transcriptional regulatory function of a human THAP family protein. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—TAF-Iβ was cloned into the yeast pBD-Gal4 (Stratagene) vector and transformed into YRG-2 His-yeast. These yeast were then transformed with a cDNA library from human vascular smooth muscle cells cloned into the yeast pAD-Gal4 (Stratagene) vector and plated onto SD-Trp-Leu-His plates (34McNamara P. Seo S.-b. Rudic R.D. Sehgal A. Chakravarti D. FitzGerald G.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 yeast colonies grew and these yeast cells were spread onto one plate and then replica plated onto SD-Trp-His plates containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Only 20 colonies still grew and plasmids were isolated from these yeast and sequenced. Half of the sequenced clones were the novel human protein THAP7. Northern Analysis—A 32P-THAP7 probe was generated by high prime DNA labeling, and incubated with a poly(A) mRNA multiple tissue Northern Array (normalized using six different housekeeping genes) and a multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech). After extensive washing, the array and blot were analyzed by a phosphorimaging device. Plasmids and Proteins—THAP7 and its truncation mutants were PCR amplified from the yeast pAD-Gal4–2.1 (Stratagene) THAP7 clone and inserted into the pCMX vector, the pCDNA3.1myc His vector (Invitrogen), the pCMX Gal4 (amino acids 1–147) vector, the pEGFP C2 vector (Clontech), and pGEX-4T2. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells, and purified utilizing glutathione-Sepharose beads. Sequences of recombinant DNA were verified by automated sequencing. In Vitro Interaction Assays—For histone binding assays, 10 μg of histones purified from HeLa cells were preincubated with a pan-monoclonal anti-histone antibody (Roche) in the presence of protein G-Sepharose beads and in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins generated using the TnT in vitro translation system (Promega). For GST pull-down assays, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins or purified histones (Roche) were mixed with GST fusion proteins purified from BL21 cells in buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min, washed extensively, and bound proteins were collected on glutathione-Sepharose beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, dried, and analyzed by a phosphorimaging device. For nucleosome and histone H3 binding assays, 270 mm KCl and 1% Nonidet P-40 were used. Cell Culture and Transfections—293T cells or 293T cells containing a chromosomally integrated luciferase gene with Gal4 DNA binding sites under control of an SV40 or TK promoter were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum with penicillin/strepomycin and puromycin where necessary. Cells were seeded and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For coimmunoprecipitations, cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Luciferase assays were carried out 48 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). TSA treatment for 16 h (200 nm or 1 μm) was performed 24 h after transfection. Coimmunoprecipitations—THAP7-transfected 293T cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer A on ice for 5 min (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, plus protease inhibitor mixture). Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm and resuspended in CoIP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors, plus 1% Nonidet P-40) and sonicated. Nuclear lysates or whole cell lysates generated by harvesting cells directly in CoIP buffer and sonicated as above were incubated at a 1:1000 dilution with monoclonal anti-myc antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-NCoR antibody (Santa Cruz) overnight, pulled down with protein G dynabeads (Dynal) and washed with CoIP buffer. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were then immunoblotted with anti-myc antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, or anti-NCoR antibody as indicated. Histone Peptide Binding Assays—Biotinylated histone peptides from Upstate Biotech or Synpep were quantified by dot blot onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase to ensure equal loading. Three μg of the indicated peptide was incubated with in vitro translated THAP7 in buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Peptides were pulled down with streptavidin-agarose beads, washed, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a phosphorimaging device. Nucleosome Preparation/Chromatin Association Assays—Nucleosomes (chromatin fraction) were prepared essentially as described by Nielsen et al. (35Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In short, ∼107 293T cells were lysed in NIB buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 0.3% Nonidet P-40, some of which was saved (whole cell extract). Following centrifugation of nuclei at 2000 rpm, supernatant was saved (cytoplasmic extract) and nuclei were washed with NIB plus 0.6% Nonidet P-40 buffer (wash 1). Nuclear lysates were then treated with micrococcal nuclease for 8 min and spun at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was saved (wash 2) and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, the supernatant containing solubilized nucleosomes was collected (chromatin fraction). The presence of nucleosomes in the chromatin fraction was confirmed by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. All collected fractions were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-myc (Cell Signaling), anti-Hp1α (Upstate), and histone H1 (Upstate) antibodies as indicated or were subjected to trypsin digestion for 10 min followed by addition of ×20 soybean trypsin inhibitor where indicated. Alternatively, transfected 293T cells were lysed in buffer A (described above) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were spun down for 10 min at 2000 rpm. The nuclei were then extracted with buffer A with increasing amounts of NaCl to solubilize chromatin-associated proteins. Extracted proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described above. Reporter Gene Studies—293T cells or 293T cells containing an integrated SV40 or TK luciferase reporter gene containing upstream Gal4 DNA binding sites (Gal4 SV40-luc and Gal4 TK-luc) were seeded into 48-well plates to be 50–70% confluent the next day. 293T cells were transfected with Gal4 TK-Luc reporter and pRL Renilla luciferase (Promega), Gal4 DNA-binding protein (DBD) alone, Gal4 DBD-THAP7, or the indicated Gal4 DBD-THAP7 truncation mutant. Cells were lysed after 48 h and luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Western blots utilizing anti-Gal4 antibody (Santa Cruz) were used to verify expression of mutant constructs. For the NCoR siRNA experiment, cells were first transfected with siRNA for 24 h, followed by transfection with reporter constructs. For dose response and repressor mapping, the data from three independent experiments were averaged. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—293T cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min followed by addition of 0.125 m glycine for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, spun down at 1,000 rpm, and resuspended in chromatin immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Cells were then sonicated for a total of 30 s at level 3. After a 14,000 rpm spin, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold in chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.1% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and blocked with protein G-Sepharose beads and 20 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. After spinning down the beads at 3,000 rpm for 1 min, the supernatant was incubated overnight with anti-acetylated histone H3, anti-acetylated histone H4 (Upstate), anti-Gal4, anti-NCoR, anti-HDAC3, or anti-HDAC4 antibodies (Santa Cruz). The IP material was pulled down by incubating with protein G-Sepharose for 3 h and beads were washed once with wash buffer 1 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), again with wash buffer 1 plus 350 mm NaCl, once with wash buffer 3 (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and twice with TE, pH 8.0. Immune complexes were eluted in 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate). Cross-links were reversed after addition of 200 mm NaCl by incubation overnight at 65 °C. DNA was then isolated using Qiagen spin columns and analyzed by PCR utilizing primers generated against the promoter of the MH100 TK-luc plasmid. THAP7 Identification, Homologues, and Expression—To search for novel TAF-Iβ interactors and potential histone-binding proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using TAF-Iβ as the bait and a human vascular smooth muscle cell library. Of the 20 strongest interacting clones, half were the hypothetical human protein THAP7. Human THAP7 is 309 amino acids long and contains a proline-rich region and a basic stretch at its C terminus (Fig. 1A). It also contains a newly discovered and highly conserved THAP zinc finger domain that is found in at least 12 distinct human proteins, and also in mouse, rat, pig, cow, chicken, Xenopus, zebrafish, C. elegans, and Drosophila proteins (28Roussigne M. Kossida S. Lavigne A.C. Clouaire T. Ecochard V. Glories A. Amalric F. Girard J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 66-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mouse homologue of human THAP7 has 93.2% identity at the amino acid sequence throughout the entire length of the protein, whereas the rat homologue contains 92.2% identity (Fig. 1B). However, the rat homologue of THAP7 has an extended N terminus that contains a RanGAP domain, containing a leucine-rich repeat domain as well as a tropomodulin domain within it. The rat homologue also contains a tubulin domain not present in the human and mouse proteins (Fig. 1A). It is possible that this extended sequence of the rat homologue represents a chromosomal translocation that resulted in a fusion protein during evolution. None of these proteins has been characterized to date. THAP7 poly(A)+ mRNA is expressed in all human tissues examined and is expressed as three distinct transcripts (approximately 1.2, 1.3, and 1.6 Kb) (Fig. 1, C and D). It is hyper-expressed in testes and up-regulated in the leukemic cell line K562. The implication of this expression pattern is currently unknown. THAP7 Associates with Histone Tails in Vitro—We isolated THAP7 in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the INHAT subunit TAF-Iβ. Because very little is known about the function of the recently identified novel THAP domain proteins, we set out to extensively characterize the THAP7 protein. Because TAF-Iβ binds to histones, we set out to determine whether THAP7 could also associate with histones in vitro. In vitro translated 35S-labeled THAP7 was incubated with histones purified from HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-histone antibody. THAP7 was pulled down only in the presence of histones (Fig. 2A), whereas under the same conditions, the transcription factor and nuclear hormone receptor RARα was not. To determine whether THAP7 could associate directly with histones, we incubated individually purified histones with GST or GST-THAP7. GST proteins used in binding assays are shown in Fig. 2B. GST-THAP7 bound to both histone H3 and histone H4, but not to histone H2A or histone H2B (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that THAP7 binds directly to histones, and that the interaction is specific for histones H3 and H4. To further analyze if this interaction was dependent upon histone tails, we used recombinant GST-histone H3 fusions containing only the histone tail (amino acids 1–46) or a mutant lacking the tail (Fig. 2D, left panel). 35S-Labeled THAP7 bound to GST-histone H3 and to the GST-histone H3 tail, but binding was almost completely absent to histone H3 that lacked the tail (Fig. 2D, right panel). These results demonstrate that the histone H3 tail is necessary and sufficient for THAP7 interaction in vitro. In vivo, histones primarily exist in the form of histone-DNA complexes termed nucleosomes. To examine if THAP7 could also bind to intact nucleosomes isolated from cells and to determine whether the binding was indeed dependent upon histone tails, we purified nucleosomes from 293T cells using published protocols (35Nielsen A.L. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Ortiz J.A. Remboutsika E. Chambon P. Losson R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), trypsinized the nucleosomes as previously reported (36Guyon J.R. Narlikar G.J. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and tested their ability to bind GST-THAP7 (Fig. 2E). After trypsinization, nucleosomes run at a characteristically smaller size on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2E, left panel) because of the removal of exposed tails (36Guyon J.R. Narlikar G.J. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Intact nucleosomes bound to GST-THAP7 but not GST (Fig. 2E, middle panel). Because histone H2A and histone H2B exist in a tight complex with histones H3 and H4 in nucleosomes, GST-THAP7 as expected pulled down all the core histones present in the nucleosome. Importantly, tail-less nucleosomes did not bind to GST-THAP7 (Fig. 2E, right panel). These results together indicate that histone tails are essential for THAP7-histone/nucleosome interactions. To further examine whether the histone binding properties of THAP7 are mediated by histone tails, we utilized histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tail peptides conjugated to biotin. These peptides were incubated with in vitro translated THAP7, washed, and pulled down with streptavidin-agarose. Full-length THAP7-(1–309) bound to both histone H3 and H4 tails (Fig. 3B, middle panel). We next mapped the histone interaction domain (HID) of THAP7. For this purpose, we incubated a series of in vitro translated and radiolabeled THAP7 mutants (Fig. 3B, left panel, schematic shown in Fig. 3A) with biotinylated histone H3 or H4 tails in vitro. All of the THAP7 mutants that contained the C-terminal 77 amino acids, rich in positively charged residues, could bind to histone H3 and histone H4 tails, but a mutant (1–231) lacking this region could not (Fig. 3B, middle and right panels). These binding results (summarized in Fig. 3A) indicate that the THAP domain is not necessary and that the C-terminal 77 amino acids of THAP7 are necessary and sufficient for histone H3 and H4 tail binding in vitro. This region is thus referred to as the HID. THAP7 Associates with Chromatin in Intact Cells—Because THAP7 associated with nucleosomes, total histones, and histone tails in vitro, it was important to demonstrate that THAP7 does indeed associate with chr"

They preferentially associate with ubiquitously expressed E proteins of the basic helix-loop-helix family and prevent them from binding to DNA and activating transcription. Although their small size suggests that Id proteins enter and exit the nucleus by passive diffusion, several studies have indicated that other pathways may regulate their subcellular localization. In this study, we obtained evidence that Id2 has the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. When passive diffusion was prevented by fusion with green fluorescent protein (GFP), Id2 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Using GFP fusion constructs, we demonstrated that the C-terminal region is required for cytoplasmic localization. Nuclear accumulation of GFP-Id2 in cells treated with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B suggests that the nuclear export receptor chromosome region maintenance protein 1 mediates the cytoplasmic localization of Id2. Id2 contains two putative leucine-rich nuclear export signals, and the nuclear export signal in the C-terminal region is essential for nuclear export. On the other hand, the helix-loop-helix domain is important for nuclear localization. Finally, experiments using reporter assays revealed an inverse correlation between nuclear export and transcriptional repression via the E-box sequence. Based on all these findings, we propose that nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling is a novel mechanism for the regulation of Id2 function.

To date, four individual Id genes, Id1–Id4, have been identified in mammals. They display overlapping but distinct expression patterns in a variety of cell types and tissues. Their important and nonoverlapping functions have been demonstrated by extensive analyses of knock-out mice (3Yokota Y. Mansouri A. Mori S. Sugawara S. Adachi S. Nishikawa S. Gruss P.

Christy B.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed additional roles for these proteins in apoptosis, cellular senescence, and tumorigenesis (2Ruzinova M.B. Benezra R. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 410-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 9Fong S. Debs R.J. Desprez P-Y. Trends Mol.

Physiol. 2002; 190: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).All members of the Id protein family share a similar overall structure consisting of the highly conserved helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain and the less conserved N- and C-terminal regions. Via their HLH domain, Id proteins preferentially associate with ubiquitously expressed bHLH E proteins such as E2A, E2–2, and HEB and sequester them from tissue-specific bHLH proteins exemplified by MyoD and Mash1 (1Norton J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ruzinova M.B. Benezra R.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Id proteins lack a basic region that is critical for DNA binding, the heterodimer between Id and E proteins fails to bind to an E-box DNA sequence, and consequently the expression of genes possessing the E-box sequence in their regulatory elements is repressed. The affinities of Id2 and Id3 for E proteins are modulated by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of the Ser-5 residues in the N-terminal regions (12Hara E. Hall M. Peters G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Deed R.W. Hara E. Atherton G.T. Peters G. Norton J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6815-6821Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Id2 is also important for apoptotic induction (14Florio M. Hernandez M-C. Yang H. Shu H.-K. Cleveland J.L. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5435-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and protein degradation (15Fajerman I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular function of the Id protein C-terminal regions.Appropriate subcellular localization is crucial for the proper function of numerous proteins. Although some proteins are constitutively nuclear, others are actively imported into and exported out of the nucleus, in a signal-dependent or -independent manner (16Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 17Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Large proteins shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes by virtue of their intrinsic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs). The NLSs and NESs are recognized by specific import and export receptors, respectively (18Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 19Suntharalingam M. Wente S.R. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In contrast, small proteins with molecular masses of less than 40 kDa can freely pass through the nuclear membrane (16Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 18Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Because the four members of the Id protein family have molecular masses ranging from 13 to 18 kDa, they are thought to enter and exit the nucleus by passive diffusion. In fact, small epitope-tagged Id2 protein is detected in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of transiently transfected COS cells (20Ghil S-H. Jeon Y.-J. Suh-Kim H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2002; 34: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Passive diffusion seems to be one mechanism deciding the subcellular localization of Id proteins, but it is likely that other regulatory pathways also exist. Norton and co-workers (21Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23603-23606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) previously showed that transiently expressed Id3 accumulated in the nucleus when one of the E2A gene products, E47, was co-expressed. Hence, they concluded that E protein acts as a nuclear chaperone for Id proteins. On the other hand, Samanta and Kessler (22Samanta J. Kessler J.A. Development. 2004; 131: 4131-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have recently presented the opposite findings. Their data suggest that Id2 and Id4 would sequester nuclear bHLH proteins to the cytoplasm to promote differentiation of cultured neural progenitors into astrocytes. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of one of the Id protein family members, Id2, has been reported to change from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during neural differentiation into oligodendrocytes (23Wang S. Sdrulla A. Johnson J.E. Yokota Y. Barres B. Neuron. 2001; 29: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Nuclear exclusion of Id2 is also observed when myeloid precursors are induced to differentiation (24Tu X. Baffa R. Luke S. Prisco M. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Here we describe the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of Id2. Our results demonstrated that Id2 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm under conditions in which passive diffusion does not occur. Then we characterize the molecular determinants that govern the predominant cytoplasmic localization and identify a functional leucine-rich NES in the C-terminal region. We also show that Id2 is localized in the nucleus when nuclear export is blocked and that the HLH domain is important for nuclear localization. Finally, our data suggest that nuclear export of Id2 has an inhibitory effect on repression of E-box-mediated transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—For construction of the N-terminally GFP-tagged Id1–Id4 plasmids, cDNAs encoding full-length mouse Id1–Id4 were inserted into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Deletion and mutant constructs of GFP-tagged Id1–Id4 were generated by PCR amplification using their respective wild-type constructs as templates and appropriate primer pairs including artificial HindIII (for forward primers) and BamHI (for reverse primers) restriction enzyme sites. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. A tandem-duplicated GFP (GFP × 2) plasmid was constructed by ligating the PCR-amplified BamHI-HindIII fragment of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coding region to the BglII/HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1. Two oligonucleotides, 5′-AGCTTCGCTGACCACCCTGAACACG-GACATCAGCATCCTGTCCTTGCAGGCATCTGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATCCTTCAGATGCCTGCAAGGACAGGATGCTGATGTCCGTGT-TCAGGGTGGTCAGCGA-3′ (reverse), were annealed and inserted into the HindIII/BamHI sites of the GFP × 2, GFP-Id3, and GFP-Id4 plasmids, resulting in GFP × 2-Id2(103–119), GFP-Id3+Id2(103–119), and GFP-Id4+Id2(103–119), respectively. To generate a plasmid coding for C-terminally FLAG epitope-tagged human E47, an EcoRI-SalI fragment was excised from the plasmid BSKS(+)-E47–2 × FLAG (kindly provided by Dr. M. Sugai) and then cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). pE7-TK-luc is a thymidine kinase (TK) fire-fly luciferase reporter plasmid harboring seven copies of the E-box sequence and is a derivative of pE7-βA-luc (25Akazawa C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8730-8738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). pCMV-MyoD was mentioned in our previous study (26Narumi O. Mori S. Boku S. Tsuji Y. Hashimoto N. Nishikawa S. Yokota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3510-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and green monkey kidney COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. The cells were seeded on appropriate plates 18–24 h before transfection. They were transfected at 50–70% confluence using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Microscopic Analysis—Cells plated on 4-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) were transfected with 0.5 μg of GFP fusion constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and subsequently mounted with the Vecta Shield reagent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochrolide (DAPI) (Molecular Probe) to stain the nuclei. In some experiments, the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB) for 3 h. LMB was a generous gift from Dr. M. Yoshida (RIKEN Discovery Research Institute, Wako, Japan). Microscopic analysis was conducted using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX-71; Olympus) equipped with a digital camera (DP70; Olympus). All of the transfections and treatments were performed in at least two separate experiments.Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—For Western blot analysis, transfected NIH3T3 cells were suspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant was used as the total cell extract. Twenty micrograms of total proteins were separated by 9–12% SDS-PAGE, and the resolved proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Biosciences). The filter was blotted with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (GF200; Nacalai), and immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, transfected COS7 cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The total cell extract was prepared as described above, and 500 μg of total proteins were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose (Sigma) by rotating for 3 h at 4 °C. Then the immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis as described above, using anti-GFP antibody or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma).Luciferase Assay—Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (26Narumi O. Mori S. Boku S. Tsuji Y. Hashimoto N. Nishikawa S. Yokota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3510-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells seeded in 24-well plates were transiently transfected with the various combinations of expression plasmids indicated in each figure legend. As a reporter plasmid, pE7-TK-luc was employed, and the total amount of DNA/well was adjusted to 804 ng by adding pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, and the luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a Luminescencer-JHR (ATTO) or Luminescencer-PSN (ATTO). The relative luciferase activity was normalized against the Renilla luciferase activity given by the internal control plasmid, phRL-TK (Promega). The assays were independently carried out at least twice in triplicate. For detection of GFP fusion proteins by Western blot analysis, the cell lysates were concentrated using Microcon YM-10 (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSThe C-terminal Region of Id2 Is Required for Cytoplasmic Localization—To examine the subcellular localization of Id2, we generated a construct wherein the full-length mouse Id2 was N-terminally tagged with GFP (Fig. 1A). The size of the fusion protein was ∼45 kDa (Fig. 1C), and we assumed that it would not undergo passive diffusion. As shown in Fig. 1B, GFP-Id2 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm when it was transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Similar results were obtained in COS7, 293T, and U2OS cells (data not shown). Unlike GFP-Id2, fluorescently tagged Id3 was previously shown to be diffusely distributed throughout the cells (27O'Toole P.J. Inoue T. Emerson L. Morrison I.E. Mackie A.R. Cherry R.J. Norton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45770-45776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-Id2 is not cell type-dependent and is not a general effect caused by fusion with a fluorescence tag.The difference in subcellular localization between fluorescently tagged Id2 and Id3 suggests that the former contains a specific domain or signal that facilitates cytoplasmic localization. Because amino acid sequences outside the HLH domains are poorly conserved among the Id protein family (11Norton J.D. Deed R.W. Craggs G. Sablitzky F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 58-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined whether the N- or C-terminal region of Id2 is involved in mediating cytoplasmic localization. Whereas truncation of the N-terminal region had no effect on the subcellular localization, truncation of the C-terminal region resulted in nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein (Fig. 1, A and B). To define the region required for cytoplasmic localization, we generated several C-terminal deletion constructs. Although GFP-Id2(1–101) showed nuclear localization, GFP-Id2(1–119) was located in the cytoplasm, indicating that amino acids between residues 102 and 119 are required for cytoplasmic localization. An internal deletion mutant, GFP-Id2(1–119Δ77–102), exhibited a cytoplasmic localization pattern indistinguishable from that of GFP-Id2(1–119). These results demonstrate that amino acids between residues 103 and 119 are responsible for the cytoplasmic localization. Protein expression of the fusion constructs was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1C).Id2 Is Exported from the Nucleus via a CRM1-dependent Mechanism—Remarkably, the 17-amino acid sequence identified above contains a leucine-rich stretch that well matches the regularly spaced hydrophobic residues in the NES consensus sequence (28Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 29Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S.

A similar region is present in Id1 but not in Id3 or Id4 (Fig. 2A). The cytoplasmic localization of NES-containing proteins is due to active nuclear export, which is in many cases mediated by the nuclear export receptor CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance protein 1) (16Mattaj I.W.

To explore the possibility that Id2 is actively exported from the nucleus via a CRM1-dependent mechanism, cells expressing the GFP-Id2 fusion protein were treated with the CRM1-specific nuclear export inhibitor LMB (31Kudo N.

After treatment of the cells with LMB, GFP-Id2 accumulated in the nucleus, and only a small proportion remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). This change of localization suggests that CRM1 mediates the nuclear export of Id2.Fig. 2Effects of LMB treatment on subcellular localization of the full-length Id2 and its C-terminal NES. A, the Id2 C-terminal 17-amino acid sequence required for cytoplasmic localization and the corresponding regions of other Id family members were aligned with established NES sequences from mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) (28Fukuda M.

Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we tested whether the putative NES located in the C-terminal region of Id2 is capable of directing a heterologous protein to the cytoplasm. A single GFP moiety is small enough to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion because its size (26 kDa) is below the exclusion limit of nuclear pores. To avoid passive diffusion of the reporter protein, we generated a tandem-duplicated GFP (GFP × 2) construct and connected it to the C-terminal 17-amino acid sequence of Id2. As reported previously (34Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F. Schaffner W. J. Biol.

In contrast, the fusion protein of GFP × 2-Id2(103–119) was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of the untreated cells, and LMB effectively blocked this cytoplasmic localization (right panels). These results clearly show that the putative NES of Id2 is autonomously functional in the CRM1-mediated nuclear export.The C-terminal NES of Id2 Is Essential for Nuclear Export— Careful examination of the amino acid sequences revealed the existence of a second leucine-rich region that conforms to the NES consensus motif at the end of the Id2 HLH domain. For simplicity, we refer to the NES sequences in the HLH domain and C-terminal region as NES-1 (residues 65–75) and NES-2 (residues 106–115), respectively (Fig. 3A). To evaluate their contribution to nuclear export, we mutated either the second or fourth conserved hydrophobic residue to alanine in the two NES sequences and examined the effect on the subcellular localization of the GFP-Id2 fusion protein. Although neither mutation in the NES-1 sequence (I69A and L75A) affected the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-Id2, both of the mutations in the NES-2 sequence (I110A and L115A) led to nuclear translocation of the fusion protein (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we concluded that the NES-2 in the C-terminal region is essential for nuclear export of Id2.Fig. 3Effects of mutations in the two NESs on subcellular localization of Id2. A, schematic representation of the full-length Id2 is depicted at the top. Id2 contains two putative NESs, the NES-1 in the end of the HLH domain and the NES-2 in the middle of the C-terminal region, respectively. Asterisks indicate conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues in the NESs. Mutants containing the replaced second and fourth residues by alanine are shown at the bottom. Dashes represent unchanged amino acids. B, representative images of NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with the mutant constructs shown in A.

This implies that Id2 may contain a specific domain or signal that promotes nuclear accumulation when nuclear export is blocked. Because GFP-Id2(1–76) comprising the N-terminal and HLH domains was exclusively localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1), we next analyzed the involvement of the short clusters of basic residues located in the two domains (Fig. 4A), although a classical NLS, a single stretch of basic amino acids or a bipartite sequence of basic residues separated by 10 nonconserved amino acids (16Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 17Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The nuclear localization of GFP-Id2(1–76) was not altered by the R11A/K12V and R24A/K26A mutations in the N-terminal region, but it was partially impaired by the K45A/K47A mutation and severely compromised by the K57T/K58Q mutation in the HLH domain (Fig. 4B). It can be assumed that the K57T/K58Q mutation would not disrupt the tertiary structure of the HLH domain, because the substituted amino acids were derived from the corresponding residues of Id3 (38Wibley J. Deed R. Jasiok M. Douglas K. Norton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In fact, we found that the K57T/K58Q mutant retained the ability to associate with E protein (data not shown).Fig. 4The HLH domain of Id2 is important for nuclear localization.

Here we show that ocean tides within the Labrador Sea were exceptionally large over the period spanning these huge, abrupt ice movements, which are known as Heinrich events. We propose that tides played a catalytic role in liberating iceberg armadas during that time."

We have shown previously that menin is required for the commitment of multipotential mesenchymal stem cells into the osteoblast lineage in part by interacting with the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 signaling molecules Smad1/5, and the key osteoblast transcriptional regulator, Runx2 (Sowa H., Kaji, H., Hendy, G. N., Canaff, L., Komori, T., Sugimoto, T., and Chihara, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 40267–40275). However, menin inhibits the later differentiation of committed osteoblasts. The activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor, JunD, is expressed in osteoblasts and has been shown to interact with menin in other cell types. Here, we examined the consequences of menin-JunD interaction on osteoblast differentiation in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. JunD expression, assessed by immunoblot, gradually increased during osteoblast differentiation. Stable expression of JunD enhanced expression of the differentiation markers, Runx2, type 1 collagen (COL1), and osteocalcin (OCN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization. Hence, JunD promotes osteoblast differentiation. In MC3T3-E1 cells in which menin expression was reduced by stable menin antisense DNA transfection, JunD levels were increased. When JunD and menin were co-transfected in MC3T3-E1 cells, they co-immunoprecipitated. JunD overexpression increased the transcriptional activity of an AP-1 luciferase reporter construct, and this activity was reduced by co-transfection of menin. Therefore, JunD and menin interact both physically and functionally in osteoblasts. Furthermore, menin overexpression inhibited the ALP activity induced by JunD. In conclusion, the data suggest that menin suppresses osteoblast maturation, in part, by inhibiting the differentiation actions of JunD.

Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2002; 61: ii40-ii42Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). AP-1 consists of dimers formed by members of the Fos, Jun, and ATF protein families. Fos proteins (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) are only able to heterodimerize with members of the Jun family, whereas the Jun proteins (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) can both homo- and heterodimerize with Fos proteins to form transcriptionally active complexes. AP-1 is implicated in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and oncogenic transformation (2Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). AP-1 activity is controlled by upstream kinases and is modulated by other transcription factors. The study of genetically modified mice (and cells) has provided some insights into the biological functions of AP-1 family members (1Wagner E.F. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2002; 61: ii40-ii42Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Jochum W. Passeque E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Deletion of Fra1, c-Jun, or JunB in mice is embryonic lethal, whereas lack of c-Fos, FosB, or JunD is not. Thus, some Fos/Jun proteins are essential and these and the others may have redundant or overlapping functions.Overexpression of c-Fos in transgenic and chimeric mice specifically affects bone, cartilage, and hematopoietic cell development, and the mice develop osteosarcomas (4Grigoriadis A.E. Schellander K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Homozygous c-Fos knock-out mice are growth-retarded, lack osteoclasts, and develop osteopetrosis with deficient bone remodeling (5Castellazzi M. Spyrou G. La Vista N. Dangy J.P. Piu F. Yaniv M. Brun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Fos is an essential regulator of macrophage/osteoclast lineage determination and bone remodeling (6Wang Z.Q. Ovitt C. Grigoriadis A.E. Mohle-Steinlein U. Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1992; 360: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either Fra-1 or ΔFosB increases bone formation causing osteosclerosis in transgenic mice (7Jochum W.

Bouali Y. Mukhopadhyay K. Ford K. Nestler E.J. Baron R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). ΔFosB, a naturally occurring alternatively spliced product lacking the COOH-terminal part of FosB and hence a known transcriptional domain, nonetheless does influence transcriptional activity possibly by heterodimerizing with other AP-1 proteins such as JunD (8Sabatakos G. Sims N.A. Chen J. Aoki K. Kelz M.B. Amling M. Bouali Y. Mukhopadhyay K. Ford K. Nestler E.J. Baron R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Studies of engineered mice with altered Fra-2 expression indicates that this AP-1 factor plays important roles in both osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. Bone volume is markedly reduced and both number and sizes of osteoclasts are dramatically increased in Fra-2 knock-out mice (9Hoeberts A. Eferl R. Karreth F. Schilling A. Priemel M. Amling M. Wagner E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: S3Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Loss of JunB in mice results in reduced bone formation and severe bone turnover osteopenia mainly due to a cell-autonomous osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation defect (10Kenner L. Hoebertz A. Beil T. Keon N. Karreth F. Eferl R. Scheuch H. Szremska A. Amling M. Schorpp-Kistner M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The role that JunD might play in bone biology is less clear. It is known that while the various AP-1 family members are differentially expressed in osteoblasts in vitro, Fra-2 and JunD predominate in differentiating osteoblasts (11McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Kundu R. Harrison R.J. Dobner P.R. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4398-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Homozygous JunD-/- mice show reduced postnatal growth, although the nature of any altered bone phenotype has not yet been examined (12Thepot D. Weitzman J.B. Barra J. Segretain D. Stinnakre M.G. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 143-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and JunD-/- males exhibit defects in reproduction although no defects in fertility have been observed in JunD-/- females. Therefore, the evidence overall points to redundant functions for members of the Fos/Jun family including JunD during development.Menin is the product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene, which when inactivated is responsible for an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome characterized by tumors of the parathyroid, endocrine pancreas, and anterior pituitary (13Chandrasekharappa S.C.

This suggested that menin might play a role in osteoblast formation and differentiation. We showed previously that menin is required for the commitment of multipotential mesenchymal stem cells to the osteoblast lineage (23Sowa H. Kaji H. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Tsukamoto T. Yamaguchi T.

This occurred, in part, by the roles played by menin in facilitating BMP signaling via Smads and the transcriptional activity of the key osteoblast regulator, Runx2 (23Sowa H. Kaji H. Canaff L.

Thus, menin physically and functionally interacted with Smads1/5 and Runx2 in mesenchymal stem cells. In committed osteoblasts these interactions were, for the most part, lost and menin inhibited later osteoblastic differentiation. This seemed to occur, in part, by the interaction of menin with the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway (24Sowa H. Kaji H. Hendy G.N. Canaff L. Komori T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Biol.

However, it is likely that other mechanisms are involved in the role of menin in retarding differentiation of mature osteoblasts.JunD has been identified as an interacting partner of menin, and this interaction leads to a repression of JunD-activated transcription (16Agarwal S.K.

The physiological significance of menin-JunD interaction, in any tissue, is not known. In the present study, we have examined the role of JunD in osteoblast differentiation by use of mouse MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that JunD and menin interact in these osteoblast cells and explored the consequences of this interaction with respect to the suppressive effect of menin on the further differentiation of committed osteoblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human recombinant TGF-β was from Sigma. Anti-JunD antibody was from Sigma and Type I collagen antibody was from Calbiochem LSL Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The menin rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated as described previously (15Kaji H. Canaff L. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5097-5101PubMed Google Scholar). All chemicals used were of analytical grade.Cell Culture—MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). The medium was changed twice a week.Construction of Expression Plasmids and Stable Transfection—The human sense menin cDNA expression vector was constructed as described previously (17Kaji H. Canaff L. Lebrun J.J. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3837-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). For the antisense menin construct, human menin DNA was cloned in an antisense orientation into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1(+). An XbaI-HindIII fragment bearing the mouse JunD DNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1(-) to create the sense JunD cDNA construct. Mouse JunD DNA, antisense menin DNA (AS), or empty vector (V) (each 3 μg) were transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Six hours after transfection, the cells were fed with fresh α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS. After 48 h, cells were passaged, and clones were selected in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with G418 (0.3 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS. Reduced expression of menin by AS-DNA was detected with immunoblot analysis, using the polyclonal anti-menin antibody. To rule out the possibility of clonal variation, we characterized at least three independent clones for each transfection. V-transfected cells were used as the control.Luciferase Assay—Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105/6-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with 3 μg of the reporter plasmid (p3TP-Lux) and the pCH110 plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (1 μg) using Lipofectamine. Fifteen hours later, the medium was changed to a 4% FBS-containing medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 9 h. Thereafter, the cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGF-β in medium containing 0.2% FBS. Cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity measured and normalized to the relative α-galactosidase activity, as described (17Kaji H. Canaff L. Lebrun J.J. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2001; 98: 3837-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Protein Extraction, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C. Protein quantitation was performed with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Proteins were denatured in SDS sample buffer and separated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and then transferred in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol to polyvinylidene difluoride. Blots were blocked with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 137 mm NaCl) plus 0.1% Tween 20 containing 3% dried milk powder. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the appropriate secondary antibodies (Sigma) and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system, as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For all experiments, 20 μg of protein were applied to each lane.For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, plus protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. An aliquot of the supernatant (1 mg of protein) was clarified and incubated with anti-JunD antibody on a rocking platform at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were collected with protein G Plus/protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis, as described above.RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was prepared from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis was performed, as described previously (26Sowa H. Kaji H. Iu M.F. Tsukamoto T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52240-52252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, 20-μg aliquots of total RNA were denatured, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing 2% formaldehyde, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and fixed with UV light. Membranes were hybridized to a 32P-labeled DNA probe overnight at 42 °C. The hybridization probes were type I collagen (COL1) (a gift from Dr. T. Kimura, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and mouse OCN. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice with saline citrate containing SDS and exposed to x-ray film. All values were normalized for RNA loading by probing blots with human β-actin cDNA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan).Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Reverse transcription of 5 μg of cultured cell total RNA was carried out for 50 min at 42 °C and then 15 min at 70 °C, using the SuperScript™ first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), which contained RT buffer, oligo(dT)12–18, 5× first strand solution, 10 mm dNTP, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, SuperScript II (RT-enzyme), and RNase H (RNase inhibitor). PCR using primers to unique sequences in each cDNA was carried out in a volume of 10 μl of reaction mixture for PCR (as supplied by TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan), supplemented with 2.5 units of TaKaRa TaqTM, 1.5 mm concentration each dNTP (TaKaRa), and PCR buffer (10×), which contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 500 mm KCl, and 15 mm MgCl2. 25 ng of each primer and 1 ml of template (from a 50 ml RT reaction) were used. Thermal cycling conditions were: 1) initial denaturation at 96 °C for 2 min; 2) cycling for cDNA-specific number of cycles (96 °C for 1 min, cDNA-specific annealing temperature for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min); and 3) final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Primer sequences, annealing temperature, and cycle numbers were as follows: Runx2, 5′-CAGGAAGACTGCAAGAAGGCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-ACACGGTGTCACTGCGCTGAAGA-3′ (62 °C; 25 cycles); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′ (47 °C; 24 cycles). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, the number of cycles was chosen so that amplification remained well within the linear range. Equal volumes from each PCR were analyzed by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ethidium bromide-stained PCR products were evaluated by densitometry (NIH Image J, version 1.08i, public domain program). Marker gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression in each sample.ALP Activity Assay and ALP Staining—ALP activity was assayed as described previously (27Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In brief, the assay mixtures contained 0.1 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (Sigma), 1 mm MgCl2,8mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium, and cell homogenates. After a 3-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 0.1 n NaOH, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. A standard curve was prepared with p-nitrophenol (Sigma). Each value was normalized to the protein concentration. ALP staining was performed by a standard protocol. In brief, cultured cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 100% methanol, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then overlaid with 1.5 ml of 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Invitrogen) plus 0.3 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Invitrogen) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 0.01 n NaOH, 0.05 m MgCl2, followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h in the dark.Mineralization Assay—Mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells was determined in 6- and 12-well plates using von Kossa staining and Alizarin red staining, respectively. The cells were fixed with 95% ethanol and stained with AgNO3 by the von Kossa method. At the same time, the 12-well plates were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol and stained with Alizarin red (Sigma). For quantitation, cells stained with Alizarin red were destained with ethylpyridinium chloride (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and then the extracted stain was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance at 562 nm was measured using a microplate reader, as described previously (26Sowa H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52240-52252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Statistics—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test or analysis of variance.RESULTSJunD Expression and Osteoblast Differentiation—To examine the role of JunD in the later differentiation of osteoblastic cells, we employed MC3T3-E1 cells. We have previously shown that in MC3T3-E1 cells ALP activity increased with time of culture (up to 21 days). The levels of COL1 and OPN expression were highest at days 7 and 14 of culture, respectively, whereas the expression of OCN mRNA, a terminal differentiation marker, was highest at day 21 of culture (see Fig. 9, B and C, of Ref. 23Sowa H. Kaji H. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Tsukamoto T. Yamaguchi T. Miyazono K. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21058-21069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We confirmed these changes in the present study (data not shown) and demonstrated that endogenous JunD expression, detected by immunoblot, increased throughout the culture period to reach its highest level in the terminally differentiated 21-day culture (Fig. 1, A and B). These findings suggest that JunD plays an important role in well differentiated osteoblasts.Generation of MC3T3-E1 Clones Stably Overexpressing JunD—To investigate the role of JunD in osteoblasts we first generated a set of MC3T3-E1 clones overexpressing JunD. Twenty-four clones of cells transfected with either JunD or empty vector were picked after 3 weeks of selection with G418. The clones were screened by immunoblot with anti-JunD antibody. Several clones of the JunD transfected cells showed elevated JunD expression relative to empty vector transfected cells (Fig. 1C; clones #3, #9, and #12). These clones were used for further studies.JunD Promotes Osteoblast Differentiation—To examine the effects of JunD overexpression on osteoblast differentiation we analyzed osteoblast-specific gene expression. The transcription factor, Runx2, is a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation. The expression of Runx2 was clearly increased in the JunD-stably transfected clones at day 7 of culture (Fig. 2A). At this time, levels of both COL1 and OCN mRNA were higher in JunD-transfected clones than in empty vector clones (Fig. 2B). This was reflected in higher COL1 protein levels in JunD-transfected clones, compared with the control clones (Fig. 2C). ALP plays an important role in osteoblast function and, like COL1, is an osteoblast differentiation marker. ALP staining and activity were markedly increased in the JunD-overexpressing MC3T3-E1 clones relative to empty vector-transfected controls (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that JunD promotes osteoblast differentiation.Fig. 2Effects of JunD on the expression of Runx2, bone matrix proteins, and ALP in MC3T3-E1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2126652156,"Among the four members of the syndecan family there exists a high level of divergence in the ectodomain core protein sequence. This has led to speculation that these core proteins bear important functional domains. However, there is little information regarding these functions, and thus far, the biological activity of syndecans has been attributed largely to their heparan sulfate chains. We have previously demonstrated that cell surface syndecan-1 inhibits invasion of tumor cells into three-dimensional gels composed of type I collagen. Inhibition of invasion is dependent on the syndecan heparan sulfate chains, but a role for the syndecan-1 ectodomain core protein was also indicated. To more closely examine this possibility and to map the regions of the ectodomain essential for syndecan-1-mediated inhibition of invasion, a panel of syndecan-1 mutational constructs was generated, and each construct was transfected individually into myeloma tumor cells. The anti-invasive effect of syndecan-1 is dramatically reduced by deletion of an ectodomain region close to the plasma membrane. Further mutational analysis identified a stretch of 5 hydrophobic amino acids, AVAAV (amino acids 222–226), critical for syndecan-1-mediated inhibition of cell invasion. This invasion regulatory domain is 26 amino acids from the start of the transmembrane domain. Importantly, this domain is functionally specific because its mutation does not affect syndecan-1-mediated cell binding to collagen, syndecan-1-mediated cell spreading, or targeting of syndecan-1 to specific cell surface domains. This invasion regulatory domain may play an important role in inhibiting tumor cell invasion, thus explaining the observed loss of syndecan-1 in some highly invasive cancers. Among the four members of the syndecan family there exists a high level of divergence in the ectodomain core protein sequence.

This invasion regulatory domain may play an important role in inhibiting tumor cell invasion, thus explaining the observed loss of syndecan-1 in some highly invasive cancers. The syndecan family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans is composed of four vertebrate members (syndecans 1–4) that have distinct cell, tissue, and developmental patterns of expression. Differences in function among members of the family can be ascribed to these differential patterns of expression and to differences among the members in the variable region of their cytoplasmic domains (1Rapraeger A.C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Importantly, the syndecans also have highly divergent extracellular domain (ectodomain) core protein sequences, suggesting that this may dictate differing functions. However, differences in ectodomain core protein structure among syndecans apparently do not exist to dictate heparan sulfate structural features because different syndecan core proteins on the same cell surface bear heparan sulfate chains very similar in structure (2Zako M. Dong J. Goldberger O. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Deakin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13561-13569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This leaves the more likely possibility that divergent regions within the core proteins have distinct functions that are either independent of heparan sulfate activity or coordinated with heparan sulfate activity. Loss of syndecan-1 expression has been shown to correlate with a poor prognosis in several tumor types including head and neck carcinoma (3Anttonen A. Kajanti M. Heikkila P. Jalkanen M. Joensuu H. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), squamous cell lung carcinoma (4Anttonen A. Heikkila P. Kajanti M. Jalkanen M. Joensuu H. Lung Cancer. 2001; 32: 297-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and gastric cancer (5Wiksten J.P. Lundin J. Nordling S. Lundin M. von Kokkola A. Boguslawski K. Haglund C. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, although much is known regarding the functional significance of this molecule, the mechanisms by which syndecan-1 exerts its effects remain unclear. It has been speculated that loss of syndecan-1 expression leads to weakened cell adhesion resulting in increased tumor invasiveness in vivo (6Inki P. Jalkanen M. Ann. Med. 1996; 28: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by our previous in vitro finding demonstrating that cell surface syndecan-1 inhibits invasion of tumor cells within type I collagen gels (7Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-invasive activity of syndecan-1 is dependent on its heparan sulfate chains but does not require the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains of the core protein (8Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the same studies also revealed that adhesion of tumor cells to collagen via heparan sulfate is not sufficient to inhibit cell invasion. This suggested the possibility that a domain within the syndecan-1 core protein is critical for inhibition of cell invasion. In the present study, expression of syndecan-1 having specific deletions or mutations of the ectodomain core protein was used to further explore the function of the core protein in inhibiting tumor cell invasion. Using this strategy we have identified an invasion regulatory domain within a region close to the transmembrane domain of syndecan-1. Together our findings indicate that syndecan-1-mediated inhibition of cell invasion requires a specific core protein domain as well as heparan sulfate chains. Cell Culture and Mutagenesis—A cDNA for murine syndecan-1 (9Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) in the pCDNA3.1 vector was subjected to oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to yield constructs having defined segments of the syndecan-1 ectodomain either removed or mutated (Fig. 1). Each mutated cDNA encodes syndecan-1, which retains all three of its heparan sulfate attachment sites, the epitope for monoclonal antibody 281.2 (10Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and unmodified transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Each construct was verified by DNA sequencing and separately transfected into the human B lymphoid cell line ARH-77. The deletion of 165 amino acids (del 88–252; Phe-88 —Glu-252) was accomplished by two separate mutagenesis reactions. The first reaction introduced an NheI site 3′ of the codons for Glu-252, the final amino acid of the ectodomain that is adjacent to the beginning of the hydrophobic sequence of the transmembrane domain. The second reaction generated on a separate syndecan-1 cDNA an NheI site just 5′ of the codons for Phe-88. The region coding for the amino-terminal fragment of syndecan-1 was excised from the mutagenic vector (with BamHI and NheI) as was the region coding for the carboxyl terminal fragment (i.e. the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains), which was removed from the second mutagenic vector (with NheI and HindIII). Both fragments were ligated together and placed into the multiple cloning site of pcDNA 3.1 (between the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites). This resulted in a syndecan-1 cDNA lacking the codons for amino acids Phe-88–Glu-252. A similar strategy was employed to generate deletions that code for proteins having smaller regions of the ectodomain core protein deleted while leaving the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains intact (del 121–252, del 147–252, del 202–252 and del 222–252). The deletion of the 16 amino acids (del 222–237; Ala-222—Asp-237) was accomplished by using a 31-bp oligonucleotide primer (5′-CATCTGGGGAGAACACAGAAGGAGCCACAGG-3′) that “bridged” the region of the syndecan-1 cDNA to be deleted. This resulted in a hairpin loop of the unwanted bases that were eliminated from the copied construct during the process of mutagenesis. Mutations were also prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Mut 222–226 was generated using the primer 5′-TCTGGGGAGAACCAGGTCAGGGTCAGGGGAGCCCGGCCTGCGG-3′, changing amino acids 222–226 (AVAAV to LWLAR). Mut 147–162 was generated using the primer 5′-GTCACCACAGCCAGGCAGCTGTCACATCTCATCCGGCTAGCGGCATGCAACCTGGCCTCGCATGAGACCTAGGC-3′, changing amino acids 147–162 (QAAVTSHPHGGMQPGL to RQLSHLIRLAACNLAS). All mutagenic constructs were confirmed by automated sequence analysis with a Model 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Big Dye Terminator chemistry (kit 4314417). ARH-77 human B lymphoid cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells express little if any endogenous syndecan-1 (11Dhodapkar M.V. Abe E. Theus A. Lacy M. Langford J.K. Barlogie B. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 2679-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARH-77 cells transfected with a pMAM-neo vector containing a murine syndecan-1 cDNA (clone B3P3 (7Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were used as a wild-type syndecan-1-expressing cell line in all assays. Cells were maintained in culture as described previously (7Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARH-77 cells were transfected with the vector containing mutant syndecan-1 constructs or vector alone (neomycin control) by liposome-mediated transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells expressing syndecan-1 were isolated by “panning” using a monoclonal antibody 281.2. Upon release of cells from the plates, expression of syndecan-1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Western Blotting—Syndecan-1 was isolated by extracting cells with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were brought to a final concentration of 8 m urea and 50 mm sodium acetate. Syndecan-1 was isolated by ion exchange and affinity chromatography as described previously (12Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent aliquots of proteoglycan, still bound to the beads, were digested twice with chondroitinase ABC (50 milliunits/ml) (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan), then eluted and analyzed on a 4–12% acrylamide, Tris/glycine gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to cationic membranes (Zeta probe membrane; Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with 125I-labeled 281.2 antibody and visualized on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Filtration Chromatography—35SO4-labeled syndecan-1 was isolated and treated with chondroitinase ABC as described above under “Western blotting”. After washing the heparan sulfate chains were liberated from the core protein by incubation with 0.1 n sodium hydroxide in 1 m potassium borohydride for 24 h at 37 °C. Released heparan sulfate chains were recovered in the unbound fraction and neutralized on ice with dropwise addition of glacial acidic acid. After the addition of unlabeled heparin as carrier (50 μl of 1 mg/ml heparin), the heparan sulfate chains were precipitated in cold 70% ethanol for 1 h at –20 °C and recovered by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min). The pellet was resuspended in column buffer (1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 0.02% sodium azide) and analyzed on a 0.5 × 46-cm column of Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity Co-electrophoresis—The affinity of syndecan-1 for collagen was determined by affinity co-electrophoresis as described previously (13Langford J.K. Stanley M.J. Cao D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29965-29971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35SO4-labeled syndecan-1 was isolated by extracting cells as described above. After affinity isolation and buffer exchange into running buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, 50 mm sodium MOPSO 1The abbreviations used are: MOPSO, 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TDM, triple deletion mutant. (Fluka Biochemika, Ronkonkoma, NY), pH 7.0), ∼50,000 cpm of labeled material was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel having nine parallel lanes of agarose each containing different concentrations of type I collagen (12Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gel was soaked in 5% acetic acid for 4 h and dried overnight with forced air at 42 °C, and the labeled material was imaged using a PhosphorImager. Assay for Cell Invasion—Quantification of cell invasion was performed as described previously (7Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5.0 × 104 cells were placed on the surface of a hydrated type I collagen gel (0.5 mg/ml; Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). Forty-eight hours later, after determination of the depth of cell invasion, a limited trypsin digestion was employed to release the attached “noninvasive” cells on the surface of the gel. This was followed by extensive collagenase digestion to release and recover the invasive cells. The number of noninvasive versus invasive cells was quantified using a Coulter counter. In some experiments, immunohistochemical analysis of syndecan-1 expression was performed on the cells invading the collagen gels. After the 48-h invasion period, gels containing tumor cells were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. The gels were carefully removed from the plates and washed twice with 50 ml of PBS for 24 h at 4 °C. Gels were cut into smaller pieces (∼1/10 gel volume), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The gel pieces were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody 281.2 overnight at 4 °C then washed 3 times with PBS at 4 °C (total wash time 24 h). Gels were placed onto eight-well culture glass slides (wells were removed, leaving the rubber gasket to support the coverslip), and coverslips were applied. Immunostaining was viewed using a laser scanning confocal microscope. Assay for Collagen Binding—Cell binding to collagen was assayed as described previously (15Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 16Sanderson R.D. Sneed T.B. Young L.A. Sullivan G.L. Lander A.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3902-3911PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 8.0 × 104 cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 96-well plates (polyvinyl U-bottomed plates; Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) that had been coated with either type I collagen (1 mg/ml) or BSA (1 mg/ml). The plate was centrifuged at 120 × g for 20 min. After centrifugation, cells were fixed and then stained with 4% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline. In this assay unbound cells formed a densely stained pellet, whereas bound cells remained as a uniform coating on the well surface. Assay for Cell Spreading—Glass coverslips were coated with 50 μlof either monoclonal antibody 281.2 (20 mg/ml) in PBS or 0.1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were washed with PBS and blocked with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were placed into the wells of a 6-well plate, and cells were added (1.0 × 105 cells/well) in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Uropod Staining—Approximately 50,000 cells were gently transferred into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing prewarmed (37 °C) 37% formaldehyde (final concentration was 3.7%) and fixed for 5 min. Cells were washed twice by adding 1 ml of PBS and centrifuging at 800 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in PBS containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody 281.2 at room temperature for 45 min. Cells were gently washed in PBS and resuspended in one drop of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA). Slides were examined by fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy with an Olympus BX60 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and results were recorded by digital photography. Quantification of Cell Surface Syndecan-1—Cells expressing syndecan-1 were harvested by centrifugation and incubated for 30 min on ice with 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody 281.2 in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After 3 washes cells were resuspended in 500 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and analyzed by flow cytometry. A Membrane-proximal Region of the Syndecan-1 Ectodomain Is Required for Inhibition of Cell Invasion—Syndecan-1-mediated inhibition of cell invasion into collagen gels requires the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1, and previous work indicates that regions of the core protein may also be required (8Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility cells expressing a syndecan-1 deletion mutant lacking amino acids 88–252 (del 88–252) of the core protein were engineered. This form of syndecan-1 retains the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains as well as the amino-terminal region of the core protein that includes the heparan sulfate attachment sites (Fig. 1). In contrast to cells expressing wild-type syndecan-1, which fail to invade collagen gels, the cells expressing the del 88–252 form of the proteoglycan readily invade (Fig. 2A). The depth of invasion of these cells is ∼90% that of control cells that express a form of syndecan-1 lacking heparan sulfate chains (TDM). These TDM-expressing cells invade to an extent similar to that of cells lacking syndecan-1 expression (13Langford J.K. Stanley M.J. Cao D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29965-29971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, the number of invading cells is also greatly enhanced by deletion of this large region of the ectodomain (Fig. 2B). To confirm a role for syndecan-1 in inhibiting invasion and to map the region within the core protein that is required for the anti-invasive effect of syndecan-1, a series of transfected cells expressing core proteins with deletions or mutations was generated. Each construct included the region of the core protein that contains the heparan sulfate attachment sites as well as the intact transmembrane and extracellular domains (Fig. 1). Testing of cells expressing the other deletions (del 122–252, del 147–252, del 202–252, and del 222–252) indicated that the location of the region active in regulating cell invasion was within the region containing amino acids 222–252 (not shown). A further deletion narrowed this down to a stretch of 16 amino acids (222–237) (Fig. 2). Mutational analysis using relatively conservative amino acid substitutions narrowed the active region down to a stretch of 5 amino acids (amino acids 222–226) (Fig. 2). To confirm this result and ensure that it was not due to a transfection artifact, a second transfection was performed, and the cells were sorted and examined in the invasion assay. As before, cells bearing syndecan-1 with the 222–226 mutation invaded collagen gels (data not shown). As a control a mutation in a region more distal from the membrane (amino acids 147–162) was constructed. Cells expressing this construct failed to invade gels, thus mimicking the behavior of cells expressing wild-type syndecan-1 (Fig. 2). Also tested were cells expressing a syndecan-1/CD4 chimera. This chimeric proteoglycan is composed of the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and most of the ectodomain except 15 amino acids of the wild-type syndecan-1 juxtamembrane domain (amino acids 238–252) which are replaced by the corresponding amino acid sequence of the human CD4 antigen (17Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These cells also failed to invade gels, indicating that the juxtamembrane domain is not required for inhibition of invasion (data not shown). Thus, the core protein region of syndecan-1 spanning amino acids 222–226 comprises at least in part an invasive regulatory domain that can dramatically influence the behavior of invading cells. Characterization of the Mutated Syndecans—Characterization of the cells and purified syndecans was undertaken to ensure that the mutated syndecans were expressed at the cell surface and bore heparan sulfate chains similar to wild-type syndecan-1. Western blotting shows that the wild-type syndecan-1 and del 222–237 are virtually identical in size (Fig. 3A). This is expected because the del 222–237 only varies by 16 amino acids from the wild-type molecule. The broad smear present after chondroitinase ABC digestion indicates that the core proteins of the two molecules are similar in heparan sulfate content. This is confirmed by demonstration that syndecan-1 isolated from cells expressing either wild-type or del 222–237 syndecan have virtually identical affinities for type I collagen (Fig. 3B). In addition, analysis of isolated heparan sulfate chains reveals that even in syndecans lacking a large region of the ectodomain (amino acids 88–252), the heparan sulfate chains are similar in size to those present on wild-type syndecan-1 (Fig. 3C). Analysis by flow cytometry of immunostained syndecan-1 revealed that all of the mutants express relatively high levels of the proteoglycan on the cell surface (mean fluorescence intensity levels of 123, 139, 110, and 194 for del 88–252, del 222–237, mut 222–226, and mut 147–162, respectively). To exert its anti-invasive effect, syndecan-1 must be retained at the cell surface (7Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the invasive behavior of cells expressing syndecan-1 with ectodomain deletions or mutations could result from enhanced ectodomain shedding from the cell surface. To examine this possibility, immunohistochemical examination of the cells invading within the collagen gels was performed (Fig. 4). The highly invasive control cells that express the triple deletion mutant of syndecan-1 (TDM), which lacks heparan sulfate chains, clearly has syndecan-1-positive cells that are deeply invasive (Fig. 4A). Similarly, cells bearing mut 222–226 also retained syndecan-1 expression on invading cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, enhanced invasion of the cells bearing mutated syndecan-1 is not due to the absence of syndecan-1 on the cell surface of the invading cells. As a final characterization step, the structure within and adjacent to the invasion regulatory domain of the wild-type syndecan-1 core protein (amino acids 222–226) was assessed for its structure using a conformational family approach. The secondary structure prediction method, NnPredict (18Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), indicates that the invasion regulatory domain is within a short α-helical segment that is flanked on either side by an expanse of random loop structure (Fig. 5). This analysis also reveals that the helical structure present in this region of the wild-type core protein is maintained in the mut 222–226 syndecan-1. Thus, loss of the ability of mut 222–226 to inhibit invasion is not due to a dramatic difference in protein structural conformation between the wild-type and mutant core proteins. Elimination of the Invasion Regulatory Domain Does Not Alter Syndecan-1-mediated Cell Adhesion, Cell Spreading, or Membrane Targeting—In the ARH-77 cell model used for these studies, we have previously demonstrated that expression of syndecan-1 mediates cell adhesion to type I collagen-coated wells (7Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether the mutation in the ectodomain core protein of syndecan-1 that regulates the invasion of these cells in collagen gels has an effect on cell adhesion, we tested them in a cell binding assay. In this assay cells are added to collagen-coated wells of a 96-well plate. After a short incubation period, the plate is subjected to low speed centrifugation. Adhesive cells resist the applied centrifugal force leaving them evenly coated in the well. Non-adhesive cells form a pellet in the bottom of the well. Using this assay, we find that all ectodomain mutants tested have the ability to anchor cells to collagen (Fig. 6A). Because changes in cell morphology are required for active cell migration, we examined cells expressing the syndecan-1 ectodomain mutants for their ability to mediate changes in cell morphology (i.e. cell spreading). We reasoned that because cells bearing mutant syndecans are more invasive than controls, they may have a spreading phenotype distinct from controls. However, this is not the case, as cells bearing mutant syndecans spread similarly to cells bearing wild-type syndecan-1 (Fig. 6B). Last, we have previously demonstrated that syndecan-1 can be targeted to and concentrated within a membrane protrusion on myeloma cells known as the uropod (19Borset M. Hjertner O. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yang Y. Borset M. Langford J.K. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12888-12893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Concentration of syndecan-1 within the uropod can promote cell-cell adhesion and, thus, may facilitate the inhibition of cell invasion mediated by syndecan-1. To determine whether mutation of the syndecan-1 ectodomain inhibits targeting of syndecan-1 to uropods, we examined the localization of syndecan-1 on the surface of polarized ARH-77 cells. Results show that, like wild-type syndecan-1, mutated syndecan-1 localizes to uropods, indicating that the mutation of syndecan-1 does not result in altered targeting of the molecule that could affect its function (Fig. 6C). Together, these findings demonstrate that mutation of the invasion regulatory domain does not alter syndecan-1-mediated cell adhesion to collagen, cell spreading, or targeting of syndecan-1 to uropods. Thus, the invasion regulatory domain appears to specifically promote the anti-invasive function while not impacting other known functions of syndecan-1. Using a panel of cell lines bearing various mutations in the syndecan-1 ectodomain core protein, we identify an “invasion regulatory domain” composed of five amino acids relatively close to the cell membrane. This domain is required for mediating the anti-invasive effect of syndecan-1. Deletion of the region containing this domain or mutation of this domain renders the otherwise intact syndecan-1 unable to inhibit cell invasion into type I collagen gels. Taken together with our previous studies (13Langford J.K. Stanley M.J. Cao D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29965-29971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we conclude that there are at least two requirements for syndecan-1 to mediate its anti-invasive effect; that is, the presence of heparan sulfate chains and the invasion regulatory domain within the ectodomain core protein. We envision that the heparan sulfate chains engage the extracellular matrix or adjacent cell surface receptors, and the invasion regulatory domain either independently or in cooperation with the heparan sulfate chains interacts with receptors at the cell surface to generate signals that block invasion of the cell. Although it is possible that manipulation of the syndecan-1 ectodomain core protein sequences has caused a conformational change that leads to the loss of biological activity, several lines of data suggest otherwise. First, although mutation of the invasion regulatory domain abolishes the syndecan-1-mediated inhibition of cell invasion, all other biological functions of syndecan-1 examined (adhesion to collagen, cell spreading, and localization on the cell surface) are unaffected. Second, mutation of a 16-amino acid region distant from the cell surface (mut 147–162) does not alter syndecan-1-mediated inhibition of cell invasion. Third, prediction of the secondary structure of the core protein of wild-type syndecan-1 and that of the most restricted mutation (mut 222–226) suggests that the physical structure of the core protein is not substantially altered in this mutation (Fig. 5). Another possibility is that changes in the invasive capacity of cells can be dictated by signals generated via the formation of syndecan-1 homo-oligomers and that mutations in the core protein can block these oligomers from forming. For example, syndecan-3 forms multimers upon extraction and examination on SDS-PAGE (21Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The region that appears to mediate this association lies within the transmembrane domain and a small portion of the juxtamembrane ectodomain of syndecan-3. This is within a highly conserved area and is shared between all members of the syndecan family. However, this conserved region that mediates oligomerization does not extend far enough to encompass the invasion regulatory domain that we have identified in the present study. Furthermore, work with the syndecan/glypican-1 chimeras suggests that oligomerization is not required to inhibit invasion. This is based on the finding that an intact syndecan-1 ectodomain linked to the cell surface via the glypican-1 glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail inhibits cell invasion as effectively as wild-type syndecan-1 (8Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This chimera contains the invasion regulatory domain but not the syndecan-1 transmembrane domain regions critical for oligomer formation. To our knowledge there have not been any previous reports of a function for the AVAAV stretch of amino acids that encompasses the invasion regulatory domain. Importantly, this domain of syndecan-1 is highly conserved among species, including murine (AVAAV) and human (AVVAV) (9Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 22Mali M. Jaakkola P. Arvilommi A.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6884-6889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further supporting its role in a critical function. The domain does not appear in murine syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 but is present in murine syndecan-3, although the sequence has a glutamic acid residue in place of the initial alanine (EVVAV). Syndecan-1 and syndecan-3 also differ in that the domain lies 26 amino acids from the start of the transmembrane domain in syndecan-1 but is 48 amino acids from the start of the transmembrane domain in syndecan-3. The function of syndecan-3 and relevance of the invasion regulatory domain has not been tested in our model systems. In addition to our finding regarding an invasion regulatory domain, there is mounting evidence that other specific domains within syndecan core proteins can participate in regulating signaling and cell behaviors. By screening for cell attachment using recombinant syndecan ectodomains, a stretch of 54 amino acids proximal to the GAG attachment sites in the syndecan-4 ectodomain was shown to mediate adhesion of several cell types (23McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12901-12904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28270-28276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Weak binding of Swiss 3T3 cells to syndecan-1 ectodomain was also noted using this approach, but the adhesion has not been mapped to a specific ectodomain region. Similarly, recombinant syndecan-2 ectodomain (which lacks heparan sulfate chains) was shown to participate in adhesion and regulation of cytoskeletal organization of colon carcinoma cells (25Park H. Kim Y. Lim Y. Han I. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29730-29736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In separate studies, an important functional link between the syndecan-1 ectodomain core protein and activation of αVβ3 integrin has recently been discovered. Breast cancer cell lines will spread on plates coated with antibody to the syndecan-1 core protein, and this cell spreading requires signaling via the αVβ3 integrin (26Beauvais D.M. Rapraeger A.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 286: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain core protein, but not syndecan-4 ectodomain, can inhibit cell spreading. Thus, there is a specific region within the syndecan-1 core protein that either directly or indirectly interacts with αVβ3 to promote cell spreading of breast carcinoma cell lines. However, the region of the syndecan-1 core protein mediating spreading of the breast carcinoma cells is distinct from that mediating inhibition of invasion of myeloma cells because the spreading activity maps to the region containing amino acids 87–121 (27Beauvais D.M. Burbach B.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Similar to the interaction of the syndecan-1 ectodomain with αVβ3 that promotes cell spreading of breast carcinoma cells, we speculate that syndecan-1-mediated inhibition of cell invasion occurs via an interaction between the invasion regulatory domain and an as yet unidentified signaling molecule (e.g. integrin) or signaling complex. Although the evidence supporting this is circumstantial, what is known does fit this model. First, when expressed in ARH-77 cells, a chimeric proteoglycan composed of the syndecan-1 ectodomain anchored to the cell surface via the glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail of glypican-1 mediates the inhibition of invasion, adhesion to collagen, and cell spreading on 281.2 (8Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). With no direct association with the cytoplasmic compartment, signals from syndecan-1 alone, leading to such profound changes in cell behavior as inhibition of cell invasion, would be highly unlikely. Although it is possible that the glypican-1 tail of the chimeric proteoglycan may in some fashion be capable of signaling, this does not seem to be the case in these cells. This is supported by the finding that wild-type glypican-1, although it bears heparan sulfate chains that have the capacity to bind collagen, is not capable of inhibiting cell invasion into collagen gels (8Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Glypican-1 is also incapable of anchoring ARH-77 cells to collagen with sufficient support to withstand the centrifugal force in the cell adhesion assay. This suggests that there is no connection between the glypican-1 tail and the cytoskeleton. Taken together, at least in the ARH-77 cells, it is highly unlikely that the glypican-1 tail functions in any manner other than to hold the proteoglycan ectodomain on the cell surface. Second, when the glypican-1 ectodomain is displayed on the cell via the syndecan-1 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, it gains the stability to tightly adhere cells to collagen; yet this syndecan-1/glypican-1 chimera does not inhibit cell invasion into collagen gels (8Liu W. Litwack E.D. Stanley M.J. Langford J.K. Lander A.D. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22825-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This further supports the finding that adhesion to collagen is not in itself sufficient to inhibit cell invasion. Moreover, in the syndecan/glypican chimera, the failure to inhibit invasion likely occurs because glypican-1 lacks the invasion regulatory domain and, therefore, lacks the ability to generate proper signals that inhibit cell invasion. Last, in the present work we show that mutation of the invasive regulatory domain results in the loss of anti-invasive cell behavior even though secondary protein structure is maintained (Fig. 5). This supports the notion that a co-receptor molecule or complex of molecules interacts with this domain with specificity and that specificity is lost when the domain is mutated even when the mutation consists of amino acid substitutions that are relatively conservative. Whether syndecan-1 functions as a molecular facilitator, as has been suggested for molecules such as the tetraspanins (28Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), or is an individual partner organized by other molecules remains to be determined. It is clear, however, that although the heparan sulfate chains are critical for anchorage to extracellular matrix components (i.e. collagen), the ectodomain core protein of syndecan-1 is also required for inhibition of cell invasion. Thus, the loss or reduction in the levels of the syndecan-1 core protein that is seen in many human tumors (3Anttonen A. Kajanti M. Heikkila P. Jalkanen M. Joensuu H. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 4Anttonen A. Heikkila P. Kajanti M. Jalkanen M. Joensuu H.

Therefore, treatments designed to preserve or enhance syndecan-1 on the surface of tumor cells represents a potentially important therapeutic strategy.

Recent studies found that PKCs are commonly overexpressed in human tumors, including soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Overexpression of PKCs contributes to invasion and migration of tumor cells and induction of angiogenesis. PKC can also phosphorylate the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene-encoded P-glycoprotein and induce MDR phenotype.

Deletion and mutation analysis of the PKCα promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene identified a Sp1 binding site (-244/-234) in the PKCα promoter that is required for p53-mediated inhibition of PKCα promoter activity. More importantly, PKCα phosphorylates and activates MDR1 P-glycoprotein, whereas inhibition of PKCα by p53 leads to decreased MDR1 phosphorylation in STS cells, which sensitizes STS cells to chemotherapeutic agents. These data indicate that WT p53 may resensitize STS to chemotherapeutic agents by reducing MDR1 phosphorylation via transcriptional repression of PKCα expression.

In mammalian cells, the PKC family is further divided into three subfamilies, conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, γ), novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, θ), and atypical PKCs (ι, λ, ζ) (1Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). PKCμ is an additional PKC family member that was discovered recently and is known as protein kinase D (2Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). A distantly related PKC family includes three isoforms of the PKC-related kinases, known as PKN1, PKN2, and PKN3 (3Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although PKC family members share primary sequence similarities, the subfamily members have different enzymatic activation profiles. Specifically, conventional PKC isoforms are activated by 1,2-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine (PS) in a calcium-dependent manner, novel PKC members are activated only by 1,2-diacylglycerol and PS, and atypical PKC members are activated by PS alone as a co-factor (4Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In resting cells, PKC predominantly resides in the cytosol in an inactive state and, upon stimulation, translocates as an active kinase to discrete subcellular locations, such as the plasma membrane, membranous vesicles, cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and nucleus (5Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). PKC functions have been the subject of intense study for many years after identification of PKC as the intracellular receptor for tumor-promoting phorbol esters such as tissue-type plasminogen activator. Studies have shown that PKC activity is elevated in some human tumors when compared with that in adjacent normal tissues (6O'Brian C. Vogel V.G. Singletary S.E. Ward N.E. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3215-3217PubMed Google Scholar) and that elevated PKC activity is associated with increased metastatic or invasive potential in some human carcinoma cells (7Schwartz G.K.

More recent studies indicated that PKCα plays an important role in promotion of tumor invasion, migration, enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, and development of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype (8Park M.J.

Doriano Fabbro D. Christoph Glanzmann C. Schubiger P.A. Bodis S. Pruschy M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8203-8210PubMed Google Scholar). Although many studies have focused on dysregulation of PKC functions, it is still unclear how expression of PKCs is regulated. Mutation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 is commonly found in a wide variety of human tumors and is one of the most common genetic alterations in soft tissue sarcoma (STS), occurring in 30–60% of these tumors (15Yao J. Xiong S. Klos K. Nguyen N. Grijalva R. Li P. Yu D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8066-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p53 missense mutations occur more frequently than non-sense mutations (16Levine A.J. Momand J Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3665) Google Scholar). Cancer cells harboring missense mutant (mut) p53 appear to have a gain of function with enhanced oncogenic properties and tumorigenic potential when compared with cells that merely lose p53 function through point mutations (16Levine A.J. Momand J Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3665) Google Scholar, 17Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Also, our previous study showed that loss of WT p53 function enhances metastasis of STS (18Pollock R.E. Lang A. Luo J. El-Naggar A.K. Yu D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2035-2039PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) p53 functions as a transcription factor and, by binding to specific DNA sequences, exerts its tumor suppressor activity by stimulating transcription of growth-inhibitory genes while preventing expression of proliferation-promoting genes (19Kieser A. Weich H.A. Brandner G. Marme D. Kolch W. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 963-969PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, mut p53 activates genes repressed by WT p53. Recent reports support this model by showing that transcription of the MDR1 gene and the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen is activated by mut p53 but repressed by WT p53 (20Deb S. Jackson C.T. Subler M.A. Marin D.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chin K.V. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottrsman M.M. Science. 1991; 255: 459-462Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar). More recently, global phosphorylation and function of p53 were shown be inversely related to PKC activation (22Nakamura K. Sun Y. Yokoyama Y. Ferris D. Singh N. Ichikawa T. Shinozuka K. Kunitomo M. Colburn N. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that STS cells expressing mut p53 demonstrated MDR phenotype, whereas restoration of WT p53 to these cells sensitized them to chemotherapy (23Zhan M. Yu D. Lang A. Li L. Pollock R.E. Cancer. 2001; 92: 1556-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because PKCα is known to phosphorylate and activate the MDR-1 protein (11Gill P.K. Gescher A. Gant T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4151-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we investigated whether WT p53 may revert to MDR phenotype through inhibition of PKCα. Cell Lines—The cell lines SKLMS-1 (a human leiomyosarcoma cell line harboring a p53 point mutation at codon 245) (24Zhang L. Yu D. Hu M. Xiong S. Lang A. Ellis L. Pollock R.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3655-3661PubMed Google Scholar) and HT1080 (a fibrosarcoma cell line deficient in p53) (25Paulson T.G. Almasan A. Brody L.L. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete culture medium; Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Also, the cell lines Saos-2 (a p53-null osteosarcoma cell line) and U2-OS (an osteogenic sarcoma cell line with WT p53) were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Clones of SKLMS-1 cells stably transfected with Ala-143 temperature-sensitive mut p53 were designated SKAla-1, SKAla-2, SKAla-3, and SKNeo (vector control) (24Zhang L. Yu D. Hu M. Xiong S. Lang A. Ellis L. Pollock R.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3655-3661PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pollock R. Lang A. Ge T. Sun D. Tan M. Yu D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 985-1994PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in complete culture medium in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. These cells expressed WT p53 at 32 °C and mut p53 at 38 °C. Cells were passaged by treatment with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA (Invitrogen). Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was carried out as described previously (27Chen L. Burger R.A. Zaunbrecher G.M. Cheng H. Lincoln A.J. Mallarino M.C. Monk B.J. Khan S.A. Gynecol. Oncol. 1999; 72: 171-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline before lysis with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% leupeptin). Lysis was ensured with further sonication, and aliquots were obtained for protein determination. Two hundred micrograms of protein were mixed with SDS sample buffer and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween 20 and blotted with the appropriate anti-PKCα antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-phospho-PKCα antibody (Cell Signaling), or anti-P-glycoprotein (P-gp) antibody C219 (Centocor). The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blotting was carried out as described previously (24Zhang L. Yu D. Hu M. Xiong S. Lang A. Ellis L. Pollock R.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3655-3661PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted by using RNAzol B reagent (Biotecx Laboratories) and separated on a 1% agarose gel. Separated RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in an aqueous hybridization solution as described previously (24Zhang L. Yu D. Hu M. Xiong S. Lang A. Ellis L. Pollock R.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3655-3661PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridization probes included PKCα cDNA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA fragments radiolabeled with a random-primed labeling kit (Invitrogen) and purified with the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Blots were washed at high stringency (0.5× saline sodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% SDS at 68 °C) and exposed to Kodak BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at -70 °C. Densitometric quantitation was performed with an AlphaImager 2000 (AlphaInnotech). Transient Transfection—Transfection was carried out with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the addition of transfection mixtures, cells were incubated for another 4 h before they were cultured at different temperatures of either 32 or 38 °C for 48 h. Nuclear Runoff Assays—Nuclear runoff assays were performed as described previously (10Shih S.C. Mullen A. Abrams K. Mukhopanhyay D. Claffey K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15407-15414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, matched pairs of SKLMS-1 and SKAla-2 cells were cultured at 32 or 38 °C for 72 h. Nuclei were collected in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.35% sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min. Nuclei were then suspended in a reaction buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm rATP/rCTP/rGTP, 0.7 μm rUTP, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 units of RNasin) in the presence of 100 μCi of [32P]UTP and incubated at 30 °C for 23 min. Total RNA was extracted with the addition of 40 μg of a glycogen carrier and 0.8 ml of TRIzol reagent. Radiolabeled RNA pellets were collected using phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation before dissolution in 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Slot blots used for RNA hybridization were prepared with PKCα (2.5–5.0 μg/slot), GAPDH (1 μg/slot), and vector control (1 μg/slot). cDNAs were denatured with 100 mm NaOH at 100 °C for 10 min, neutralized with ammonium acetate to a final concentration of 1 m and directly blotted onto nylon membranes (ICN). Membranes were subsequently washed twice with 2× SSC, baked at 80 °C for 15 min, and prehybridized for 6 h at 65 °C in hybridization buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 5% SDS, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA). Hybridization was performed with equal amounts of labeled nuclear RNA (1 × 106 cpm/ml) in hybridization buffer for 20 h at 65 °C. Blots were then washed once at room temperature for 20 min and twice at 55 °C for 20 min each in 1% SDS, 1× SSC. Blots were then exposed to Kodak MR film. PKCα mRNA signal was normalized by GAPDH signal. Determination of PKCα mRNA Half-Life—SKLMS-1 and SKAla-2 cells were grown at 32 °C and 38 °C, respectively, for 72 h. Total RNA was isolated at various times (0, 12, and 24 h) after the addition of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting. The PKCα signal was normalized according to the basal level. The half-life of the mRNA was determined with the use of regression curves (28Claffey K.P. Shih S.C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). P-gp Phosphorylation in SKLMS-1 and Temperature-sensitive mut p53 Cells—P-gp phosphorylation in [32P]Pi-labeled SKLMS-1 and SKAla cells was determined as described previously (29Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 658-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, near-confluent cell monolayers grown in 75-cm2 flasks were labeled with [32P]Pi after the cells were washed with phosphate-free buffered saline and phosphate-free medium. Six milliliters of phosphate-free medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 0.6 mCi of [32P]Pi was added to cell monolayers for 3 h at 37 °C or 32 °C as indicated. The labeled cells were washed 3 times on ice with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the plates in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupepstatin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 200 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 ml/plate), and lysed on ice for 20 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected. Immunoprecipitation of P-gp was carried out according to a described previously method (29Blobe G.C. Sachs C.W. Khan W.A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Wetsel W.C. Obeid L.M. Fine R.L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 658-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of the anti-P-gp antibody C219 (Centocor) was added to 200 μl of the supernatants described above and incubated overnight in a sample rotator. Fifty microliters of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the supernatants and incubated in the sample rotator for 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation for 1 min and washed once in 1 ml of NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40 and twice in an extraction buffer containing 1 m urea. The immune complexes were dissociated from the beads by incubation in 100 μl of sample buffer for 15 min at 30 °C. Samples were then electrophoresed on 6% acrylamide gels, and autoradiography was performed. PKCα Promoter Deletion and Mutation Constructs—Human PKCα promoters (-1571/+77 and -227/+77) were generously provided by Dr. Robert Glazer (Georgetown University). All other constructs were made by amplifying the PKCα promoter with the reverse primer 5′-GGAGAGTCGGGCTGGTGCTG-3′ and the forward primers 5′-GAAAGCCTGATAATCAACATCG-3′ (-979/+75), 5′-AGCGGAAGAAGAGGAGGAGA-3′ (-422/+75), 5′-GAGTGGGGACCCGCCACT-3′ (-331/+75), 5′-GCATCCCCACTCGGGCAG-3′ (-297/+75), or 5′-CGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCG-3′ (-260/+75). PKCα promoter with Sp1 binding site mutation (-243/-239) construct was made by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotide 5′-CCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGTTTTTTCCCCTTGCCC-3′ was used to mutate the -244/-234 Sp1 site from GCCGCCTCCCC to GTTTTTTCCCC. The site-specific mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PKCα promoter deletion and mutation constructs were cloned into a TA cloning vector, and their orientation was checked using restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. The PKCα promoter deletion constructs in the TA vector were digested with KpnI/XhoI and subcloned into pGL3-basic vector containing the firefly luciferase gene (Promega). Reporter Gene Assays—Reporter gene assays were performed as described previously (15Yao J. Xiong S. Klos K. Nguyen N. Grijalva R. Li P. Yu D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8066-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, SKLMS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated in complete medium overnight at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently treated with Ad-p53 or Ad-LacZ and further incubated for 48 h. Using FuGENE 6, cells were then cotransfected with 1 μg of pGL3-basic containing the various PKCα deletion constructs and 0.5 μg of the internal control pSV40-β-galactosidase. Twenty-four hours later, SKLMS-1 were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined and normalized to β-galactosidase activity (15Yao J. Xiong S. Klos K. Nguyen N. Grijalva R. Li P. Yu D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8066-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The nuclear extracts from SKLMS-1 cells were prepared according to the method of Andrews and Faller (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). DNA binding assays for Sp1 were performed with 15 μg of nuclear extracts as described by Shie et al. (31Shie L. Wu G. Wu J. Liu F. Laham R.J. Oettgen P. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25010-25016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled double-strand wild type Sp1 oligonucleotides (5′-CCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCTCCCCTTGCCC-3′) containing the Sp1 binding site in the human PKCα promoter and mutant Sp1 oligonucleotides (5′-CCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCGTTTTTTCCCCTTGCCC-3′) were used as probes. The competition was performed with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild type or mutant Sp1 oligonucleotides. Supershift experiments were performed with anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The reactions were analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA buffer (20 mm Tris, 20 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). WT p53 Inhibits PKCα Expression—To investigate the effects of p53 on PKCα in STS, we first analyzed PKCα expression in STS cells with different p53 functional status by Western blot analysis. PKCα was highly expressed in SKLMS-1 cells, which contain mut p53, and at very low levels in U2-OS cells, which contain WT p53 (Fig. 1A). Similarly, high PKCα expression was found in HT1080 cells, which are deficient in p53, and Saos-2 cells, which are p53 null. To further define the role of p53 in modulation of PKCα expression, we used the SKAla cells, which are SKLMS-1 cells that express the Ala-143 temperature-sensitive mut p53 (26Pollock R. Lang A. Ge T. Sun D. Tan M. Yu D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 985-1994PubMed Google Scholar). The Ala-143 point mutation allows for production of WT p53 at 32 °C but mut p53 at 38 °C. Western blot analysis of PKCα in these SKAla cells showed that PKCα expression was higher when p53 was in the mutant conformation at 38 °C than when it was in the WT conformation at 32 °C (Fig. 1B), whereas the parental sarcoma cells SKLMS-1 and vector control cells SKNeo showed no significant changes in PKCα expression when they were shifted between 32 and 38 °C culture conditions. Therefore, the difference in PKCα expression between 32 and 38 °C in these SKAla cell lines was induced specifically by the change in functional p53 status, not by the temperature variation itself. We used the p21expression level as a marker for functional WT p53. To further determine the effect of WT p53 on PKCα expression in a p53 null background, we also transfected the Saos-2 cell line with the Ala-143 temperature-sensitive p53 mutant expression vector and observed the effect of WT and mut p53 on PKCα expression. Six hours after transfection, the transfected cells were shifted to 32 or 38 °C and cultured for an additional 36 h, then PKCα expression was analyzed by Western blotting. PKCα expression was inhibited when the transfected Saos-2 cells were cultured at 32 °C with WT p53 function that induced p21 expression (Fig. 1C). In contrast, PKCα level remained high when the transfected Saos-2 cells were cultured at 38 °C with mut p53 function, and the induction of p21 expression was negligible. These results clearly indicated that WT p53 inhibits PKCα expression. p53 Inhibits PKCα mRNA Expression—To determine whether p53 inhibited PKCα expression at the mRNA level, we performed Northern blot analysis of PKCα mRNA level using a PKCα-specific probe (American Type Culture Collection) in the SKLMS-1, SKNeo, and SKAla cell lines cultured at 32 or 38 °C. In SKAla-1, SKAla-2, and SKAla-3 cells, PKCα mRNA (∼9.3 kilobases) was low at 32 °C with the WT p53 conformation but high at 38 °C with the mut p53 conformation. No comparative changes were found in either parental SKLMS-1 or vector control SKNeo cells (Fig. 2A). A similar result was found in Saos-2 cells transfected with Ala-143 and incubated at 32 versus 38 °C (Fig. 2B). In addition, SKAla-2 expressing the temperature-sensitive mut p53 showed a time-dependent inhibition of PKCα mRNA expression when shifted from 38 to 32 °C and vice versa (Fig. 2C). Therefore, p53 inhibits PKCα expression at the mRNA level.Fig. 2Wt p53 inhibits PKCα mRNA expression in human STS cells. A, 30 μg of total RNA from SKLMS-1, SKNeo, SKAla-1, SKAla-2, and SKAla-3 cells was analyzed by Northern blotting. Northern blotting analysis of GAPDH was used as a loading control. B, 30 μg of total RNA from Saos-2 cells, which were transfected with Ala-143 temperature-sensitive mutant p53-expressing vectors as described in Fig. 1C, was analyzed by Northern blotting. C, temperature-sensitive p53 mutant SKAla-2 cells were cultured at 32 or 38 °C for 72 h. The cells were then shifted from 32 to 38 °C or from 38 to 32 °C, and total RNA was prepared on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 and analyzed by Northern blotting for PKCα expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) p53 Inhibits PKCα mRNA Expression through Transcriptional Repression Not Affecting PKCα mRNA Stability—Inhibition of PKCα mRNA by p53 may result from either transcriptional repression or reduced mRNA stability. To investigate the mechanism by which p53 inhibits PKCα mRNA expression, we examined the rate of transcription of PKCα by nuclear runoff assays. Although there was not a significant difference in PKCα transcription between 38 and 32 °C in parental SKLMS-1 cells, we reproducibly detected an approximate 30% reduction in expression of PKCα transcript at 32 °C (WT p53) compared with that at 38 °C (mut p53) in SKAla-2 cells (Fig. 3A). Therefore, reduced transcription may at least partly account for the decrease in PKCα mRNA level by p53. We next investigated whether p53 also inhibits PKCα mRNA stability in SKLMS-1 and SKAla cells. New RNA synthesis was blocked by treating cells with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Total RNA was extracted at different time points after treatment. Northern blot analysis using the PKCα-specific probe showed that there was not a significant difference in the measured half-life of PKCα mRNA from both SKLMS-1 and SKAla-2 cells cultured at 32 and 38 °C (Fig. 3B). Thus, the inhibited RNA expression level at 32 °C compared with that at 38 °C in SKAla-2 cells was not due to a decreased mRNA stability. WT p53 Inhibits PKCα Promoter Activity via Sp1 Binding Site—To further understand the mechanisms by which WT p53 inhibits PKCα transcription, we fused the 1.6-kilobase PKCα promoter to the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4A) to determine the effect of WT p53 on PKCα promoter activity. We preinfected SKLMS-1 cells with various doses of adenoviruses expressing WT p53 (Ad-p53) or expressing the LacZ gene (Ad-LacZ) for 48 h and subsequently transiently transfected the cells with the PKCα promoter-luciferase report construct (-1571/+77); we assayed reporter gene expression 48 h later. Compared with Ad-LacZ-infected cells, Ad-p53-infected cells showed markedly inhibited PKCα promoter activity at different cell:virus particle ratios in a viral particle concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). To localize the promoter region responsible for WT p53-mediated suppression of PKCα transcription, we generated a series of PKCα promoter deletion constructs that were composed of various lengths of 5′-promoter sequences fused to the luciferase gene (Fig. 4A). We transiently transfected the PKCα promoter-luciferase constructs and pGL3-basic vector (vector control) into SKLMS-1 cells preinfected with the Ad-p53 or Ad-LacZ (1000 virus particles/cell). The promoter activities of the various deletion constructs were not inhibited by Ad-LacZ, but they were markedly inhibited by Ad-p53 (Fig. 4C). However, the inhibitory effect of WT p53 was abolished when PKCα promoter was deleted down to -227, which also had dramatically reduced basal promoter activities. The data indicated that the -260/+77 construct is sufficient to confer WT p53-induce"
https://openalex.org/W2165936853,"Neoplastic progression in human tissues appears to be paralleled by a series of genetic and epigenetic alterations. In human colorectal cancers, defect Wnt/β-catenin/T-cell factor and RAS/RAF signaling pathways have a major contributing role in tumor initiation and progression. To date, much of the research on the consequences of β-catenin activation has been focused on genes whose expression is believed to be activated by β-catenin-associated T-cell factor-dependent transcription. Little is known about genes whose expression may be down-regulated secondary to β-catenin activation. Using a subtractive suppression hybridization approach, we identified a gene with markedly decreased expression in rat RK3E epithelial cells neoplastically transformed by β-catenin. Because expression of this gene was also down-regulated in RK3E transformed by several other oncogenes, the gene was named DRO1 for “down-regulated by oncogenes 1.” Compared with corresponding normal tissues, DRO1 expression was found to be very reduced in colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines as well as in most colorectal cancer specimens. The predicted DRO1 protein contains three repetitive elements with significant similarity to the carboxyl-terminal regions of the predicted proteins from DRS/SRPX/ETX1 and SRPUL genes, suggesting the existence of a new protein family. Ectopic expression of DRO1 in neoplastically transformed RK3E or colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell lines lacking endogenous DRO1 expression resulted in substantial inhibition of growth properties. DRO1 was found to suppress anchorage independent growth and to sensitize cells to anoikis and CD95-induced apoptosis. Our findings suggest that inhibition of DRO1 expression may be an important event in the development of colorectal and pancreatic cancers.

In a subset of the cancers with intact APC function, gain-of-function mutations affecting the amino-terminal region of β-catenin are found (10Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H.

Loss-of-function defects in APC or gain-of-function mutations in β-catenin lead to the stabilization of the β-catenin protein, which consequently accumulates in the cytoplasm and the nucleus where it can bind to and activate the transcriptional activity of members of the T-cell factor (TCF) family of transcription factors. Besides colorectal cancer, defects in β-catenin regulation are found in other tumors, such as hepatoblastoma (12Koch A. Denkhaus D. Albrecht S. Leuschner I. von Schweinitz D. Pietsch T.

Genetic alterations of the most common histological type of pancreatic cancer, i.e. ductal adenocarcinoma, more often involve multiple changes in the protooncogene K-Ras as well as the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A, p53, and SMAD4/DPC4 (reviewed in Ref. 3Bardeesy N.

Much less data have emerged on the role of genes down-regulated during transformation by different oncogenes. So far, only three genes down-regulated secondary to activated β-catenin/TCF signaling have been identified: DRCTNNB1A (27Kawasoe T. Furukawa Y. Daigo Y. Nishiwaki T. Ishiguro H. Fujita M. Satoh S. Miwa N. Nagasawa Y. Miyoshi Y. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3354-3358PubMed Google Scholar), MCP-3 (28Fujita M. Furukawa Y. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6683-6687PubMed Google Scholar), and IGFBP-6 (29Denys H. Jadidizadeh A. Amini Nik S. Van Dam K. Aerts S. Alman B.A. Cassiman J.J. Tejpar S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 654-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whereas evidence for a direct influence of β-catenin/TCF on the expression of MCP-3 and IGFBP-6 has been offered, insights into how β-catenin/TCF might mediate effects on DRCTNNB1A expression are lacking. Transformation of immortalized cell lines is often used as a model system for carcinogenesis. Candidate downstream targets of oncogenes have been identified by comparing the transcriptional status of parental cell lines with cell lines transformed by different oncogenes. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of deregulated β-catenin/TCF signaling in cancer, we used a subtractive suppression hybridization approach to identify transcripts whose expression was down-regulated following β-catenin-mediated neoplastic transformation of RK3E cells, an E1A-immortalized rat kidney epithelial cell line (30Ruppert J.M. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our efforts led to the identification of a gene with markedly decreased expression not only in RK3E cell lines transformed by β-catenin and several other oncogenes, but also in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimen. We describe here the analysis of this gene termed DRO1 (down-regulated by oncogenes 1) in normal and cancer tissues as well as studies of the functional consequences of restoring DRO1 gene expression in colon and pancreatic cancer cells. Cloning of DRO1—Subtractive suppression hybridization was performed using a PCR-based technique (31Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar) (PCR-Select, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). mRNA from the β-catenin-transformed cell line RK3E/β-catenin-S33Y-A (32Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as driver, mRNA of parental RK3E (30Ruppert J.M. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) cells served as tester. One clone was isolated that was consistently down-regulated in multiple independent β-catenin-transformed RK3E clones. Full-length rat and human cDNA sequences were obtained by screening a rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a human heart cDNA library (Stratagene), using standard techniques. The rat and human sequences of DRO1 were deposited in GenBank™ (accession numbers AY548105, AY548106, and AY548107). The entire open reading frame of human DRO1 was amplified with PfuI polymerase (Stratagene) using the oligonucleotide primers: DRO1 forward, 5′-TGAATTCCACCATGACATGGAGAATGGGACC-3′ and DRO1 reverse, 5′-ACTCGAGTCAGCTAGCGTAAGGGTATCCATGGTGATA-3′ with the human cDNA clone as template DNA. The PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the cytomegalovirus-promoter driven expression plasmid pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). An artificial carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag was introduced by ligating the annealed oligonucleotides HA forward, 5′-CTAGCGGCTACCCCTATGATGTGCCAGACTACGCCTGAC-3′ and HA reverse, 5′-TCGAGTCAGGCGTAGTCTGGCACATCATAGGGGTAGCCG-3′ into the corresponding NheI and XhoI restriction sites. The sequence of the resulting plasmid, pCDNA3-DRO1-HA, was confirmed by automated sequencing. For retroviral transduction the cDNA was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the BamHI and SalI sites of the plasmid pBABE-puro 33. pCβA-bGH contains a genomic BamHI-BglII fragment of the bovine growth hormone (bGH) gene driven by the chicken β-actin promoter (supplied by E. Wolf, Institute of Molecular Animal Breeding and Biotechnology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany). The putative promoter region of DRO1 was amplified by PCR from the human BAC-clone RP11-36I23 (library RPCI-11 from Roswell Park Cancer Institute created by M. Tateno and K. Osoegawa; obtained from RZPD, Berlin, Germany) by using the primers 5′-ACTCTAGAGCTGGGGATCCTGAACGATACACT-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTCAGGCGTAGTCTGGCACATCATAGGGGTAGCCG-3′ introducing sites for XbaI and XhoI. The obtained PCR product was subcloned into the NheI and XhoI sites of pGL3-basic (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) resulting in the construct 4235. By deleting sequences upstream of an EcoRV restriction site, an AvrII site, and a KpnI site, constructs 3607, 3135, and 1166 were generated, respectively. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany. Cell Culture—Human colorectal cancer cell lines SW948, SW620, Caco2, LS513, HT29, RKO, HCT116, SW48, WiDR, DLD1, SW480, SW403, and the cell line Colo320 (generous gifts of H. Lahm, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, and G. van Kaick, DKFZ, Heidelberg) as well as COS, 293T, RK3E, and the RK3E-derived lines, the generation of which has been described previously (32Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kolligs F.T. Kolligs B. Hajra K.M. Hu G. Tani M. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1319-1331PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines CFPAC-I, Panc I, Hs766T, MIAPaCa-2, and BxPc3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as recommended. The plasmid pBABEpuro-DRO1-HA and control plasmid pBABEpuro were used to generate amphotropic viruses as described previously (32Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Stable monoclonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution of cells 48 h after transfection with pCDNA3-DRO1-HA or control vector pCDNA3 in the presence of G418 (Invitrogen) or 24 h after infection with virus supernatant in the presence of puromycin (Sigma). For cloning efficiency assays HCT116, SW480, PancI, and BxPc3 cells were either transfected with equal amounts of pCDNA3-DRO1-HA or the corresponding empty vector. 48 h post-transfection of the plasmids 5 × 105 cells were plated on 10-cm dishes and cultured with medium supplemented with G418 (Invitrogen) for selection of transfected cells. Colonies were stained (1.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.06% methylene blue in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen)) and photographed. Assays of colony formation in soft agar were performed essentially as described previously (32Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of N-glycosylation of DRO1, COS cells were transfected with pCDNA3-DRO1-HA or empty pCDNA3 12 h prior to treatment with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 12 h. Similarly, for analysis of secretion of DRO1, cells were transfected with pCDNA3-DRO1-HA, pCβA-BGH, and pCDNA3. Serum-free medium was added 12 h after transfection. Supernatant was harvested 36 h later and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. To assess the influence of methylation on the DRO1 promoter, cells were treated for 96 h with 2 μm 5-azacytidine (Sigma) with daily replacement of growth medium. For anoikis assays cells were trypsinized into single cell suspensions. To maintain cultures in suspension 105 cells were given in 100-mm non-tissue culture plates to which cells could not attach. Reporter Assays—Colorectal cancer cell lines were transfected with 0.4 μg of Firefly reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg of Renilla luciferase control plasmid (pRL-TK, Promega). RK3E cells and RK3E-derived transformed cell lines were transfected with 0.25 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and as control for transfection efficiency with 0.25 μg of constitutively active β-galactosidase reporter plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences). Firefly and Renilla luciferase were measured with Promega's Dual-Glo luciferase kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations by using a luminescence reader (Turner, Sunnyvale, CA). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (32Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Northern Blotting—Tissue culture cells were harvested in TRIzol (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction. Organs from a 4-week-old Wistar rat were placed in TRIzol and immediately homogenized with a standard tissue homogenizer (Miccra, Muehlheim, Germany). Normal pancreatic tissue samples as well as matched pairs of normal colon and colorectal adenocarcinoma were microdissected using an adjacent hematoxylin and eosin-stained section as guidance from frozen primary tissue samples. For Northern blots total RNA (10 μg) was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action. A 1124-bp HindIII fragment of rat DRO1 cDNA and a 425-bp PCR product of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (forward primer 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; reverse primer 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′) were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Northern blot hybridization to 32P-labeled probes was carried out by standard methods. Signals were detected by exposure to Bio-Max film (Amersham Biosciences) at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. PCR—Following DNase treatment, RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers (final concentration 2.5 ng/μl) using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase as described by the manufacturer (SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR, Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed in a Rotorgene RG-3000 (Corbett Research, Sidney, Australia) real-time PCR system using SYBR-Green I dye (Molecular Probes) for detection. Primers for human and rat DRO1 were hDRO1 forward, 5′-CCTGGGCAGCGAGAAGAAGAAAG-3′; hDRO1 reverse, 5′-CCGGGATGGAGGGTAAAGATT-3′; and rDRO1 forward, 5′-ACAGGCCTGGGCAGTGACAAG-3′; rDRO1 reverse, 5′-CCGGAGGCCTATGGGAGAC-3′, respectively. For normalization of PCR, the human APP gene, the human GAPDH gene, and the rat Gapdh gene were used. APP primers have been previously published (35Saha S. Bardelli A. Buckhaults P. Velculescu V.E. Rago C. St. Croix B. Romans K.E. Choti M.A. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2001; 294: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). For human and rat cDNAs the same GAPDH primers were used: GAPDH forward, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and GAPDH reverse, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. PCR was performed using 1.25 units of Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), a final concentration of 2.5 mm MgCl2, and SYBR-green I diluted to 1:50,000. PCR efficiency was determined by analyzing serial dilutions of cDNA. Relative expression levels were calculated with QGene software (36Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1372-1379PubMed Google Scholar). Pair-wise fixed reallocation randomization test was used to determine the significance of differences between samples (37Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25592) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (Complete Proteinase Inhibitors, Roche). The protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Equal amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis in discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer of the proteins to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), and blocking in 10% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) the antibody incubation steps were performed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. High affinity monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (clone 3F10, Roche), anti-plakoglobin, and anti-β-catenin antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and anti-caspase 3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) were used at 1:1,000 dilutions, respectively. Anti-caspase 8 antibody (a generous gift of P. Krammer, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany) and the anti-actin antibody (clone AC-15, Sigma) were used at 1:100 and 1:10,000 dilutions, respectively. The chicken IgY antibody against bGH was a generous gift of M. Erhard, Institute of Animal Welfare, Ethology and Animal Hygiene, University of Munich, Munich, Germany. The DRO1-peptide IERSTLEEPNLQPLQRR (corresponding to aa 61 to 77 of human DRO1) was synthesized and coupled to a peptide carrier to increase immunogenicity. Purification was performed by high performance liquid chromatography and accuracy of peptide composition was monitored by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (provided by F. Lottspeich, MPI-Biochemie, Munich, Germany). Rabbits were immunized with the peptide according to standard protocols. Serum was affinity purified by using NHS-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to the peptide that had been used for immunization. The secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies goat anti-rat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences), goat anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), and rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Sigma) were used at dilutions of 1:10,000. The blots were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—COS cells were grown on acid-washed coverslips. 48 h after cotransfections of pCDNA3-DRO1-HA and expression plasmids for markers of the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi stack (SEC61-YFP and Gal-N-Ac-T2-YFP (38Ehehalt R. Michel B. De Pietri Tonelli D. Zacchetti D. Simons K. Keller P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)), coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min, and then permeabilized for 15 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 1% goat serum (Invitrogen) in PBS. Prior to incubation with the primary antibody, coverslips were blocked for 30 min by treatment with 20% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing with 2% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, the coverslips were incubated for 2 h with the anti-HA tag antibody in 2% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After further washes, the coverslips were incubated with a secondary goat anti-rat IgG antibody conjugated with Cy3 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) at 1:500 and for nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml for 30 min. The coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted on slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Bulingame, CA). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM2100 Meta laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using optical sections of 2 μm. Apoptosis Assays—Cells were harvested 24 h after the start of suspension cultures or 24 h after start of treatment with agonistic APO-1/CD95 antibody (a generous gift of P. Krammer, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany) at increasing concentrations. To optimize receptor cross-linking in these experiments, protein A (Sigma) was added at 1/100 the concentration of the antibody. For quantification of DNA fragmentation and cell cycle distribution, cells were scraped in PBS, centrifuged at 800 × g and lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (39Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C nuclei were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry using FACSCALIBUR and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For caspase 3 activity assays cells were harvested and lysed after 24 h in suspension. Lysates were stored at -80 °C until the assay was performed. An aliquot of the precleared supernatant was mixed with the caspase-3 Z-DEVD-AFC-substrate (Calbiochem, Schwalbach, Germany) and incubated at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured by a fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 450 ± 50 nm and a detection wavelength of 530 ± 25 nm. The level of caspase-3 activity was normalized to the amount of protein in each sample. Identification of DRO1 as a Gene That Is Down-regulated by Multiple Oncogenes—A PCR-based suppression subtractive hybridization approach (31Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar) was performed to identify genes whose expression was markedly decreased in RK3E epithelial cells neoplastically transformed by expression of a mutant stabilized form of β-catenin (S33Y-β-catenin). Based on an initial analysis of the expression patterns of 6 clones from a library of potentially down-regulated genes, we focused attention on a 675-bp cDNA fragment that showed markedly decreased transcript levels in 10 of 10 β-catenin-transformed RK3E cell lines and 9 of 9 γ-catenin-transformed RK3E lines (34Kolligs F.T. Kolligs B. Hajra K.M. Hu G. Tani M. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1319-1331PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B, and data not shown). To test whether down-regulation of this gene was specific for β- and γ-catenin-induced transformation or represented a general consequence of oncogenic transformation of the RK3E cells, we assessed expression of the identified gene in RK3E cells transformed by other oncogenes including K-Ras, H-Ras, c-MYC, and GLI (Fig. 1, A and B). Because our Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed down-regulation of the gene in all neoplastically transformed RK3E lines, regardless of the oncogene used to induce transformation, the gene was termed DRO1. DRO1 expression was detected ubiquitously in all rat organs tested (Fig. 1C). To analyze expression of DRO1 in human tissues RT-PCR studies were performed. High DRO1 expression was found in both colonic mucosa and whole pancreas preparations (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 3) as well as in microdissected colonic epithelium and pancreatic ductal epithelium (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 4). This demonstrates that DRO1 is expressed in epithelial tissues that are frequently affected by neoplastic transformation associated with deregulation of Wnt and Ras/Raf signal transduction. Rat brain and human heart cDNA libraries were screened to isolate full-length clones of the rat and human transcripts of DRO1. cDNAs for"
https://openalex.org/W1987836616,"One of the earliest effects of hypoxia on neuronal function is to produce a run-down of synaptic transmission, and more prolonged hypoxia results in neuronal death. An increase in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane, controlled by BCL-2 family proteins, occurs in response to stimuli that trigger cell death. By patch clamping mitochondrial membranes inside the presynaptic terminal of a squid giant synapse, we have now found that several minutes of hypoxia trigger the opening of large multiconductance channels. The channel activity is induced concurrently with the attenuation of synaptic responses that occurs under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-induced channels are inhibited by NADH, an agent that inhibits large conductance channels produced by a pro-apoptotic fragment of BCL-xL in these synaptic mitochondria. The appearance of hypoxia-induced channels was also prevented by the caspase/cysteine protease inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk), which inhibits proteolysis of BCL-xL during hypoxia. Both NADH and Z-VAD-fmk reduced significantly the rate of decline of synaptic responses during hypoxia. Our results indicate that an increase in outer mitochondrial channel activity is a very early event in the response of neurons to hypoxia and suggest that this increase in activity may contribute to the decline in synaptic function during hypoxia. One of the earliest effects of hypoxia on neuronal function is to produce a run-down of synaptic transmission, and more prolonged hypoxia results in neuronal death. An increase in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane, controlled by BCL-2 family proteins, occurs in response to stimuli that trigger cell death. By patch clamping mitochondrial membranes inside the presynaptic terminal of a squid giant synapse, we have now found that several minutes of hypoxia trigger the opening of large multiconductance channels. The channel activity is induced concurrently with the attenuation of synaptic responses that occurs under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-induced channels are inhibited by NADH, an agent that inhibits large conductance channels produced by a pro-apoptotic fragment of BCL-xL in these synaptic mitochondria.

Our results indicate that an increase in outer mitochondrial channel activity is a very early event in the response of neurons to hypoxia and suggest that this increase in activity may contribute to the decline in synaptic function during hypoxia. Changes in the permeability of outer mitochondrial membranes occur during normal and pathological events in cellular physiology and are also associated with the onset of programmed cell death. Mitochondria release death-promoting factors into the cytosol (1Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat.

Although in many cells, ischemic insult can lead to programmed cell death (apoptosis or necrosis), neurons are particularly sensitive to oxygen deprivation (5Banasiak K.J Xia Y. Haddad G.G. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 215-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), perhaps because of the high energy demands of synaptic transmission. Changes in synaptic efficacy occur very early during hypoxia and may, indeed, be the first response of the neuron to ischemic insult (6Aoyagi A. Saito H. Abe K. Nishiyama N.

The rapid onset of the effects of ischemia on synaptic transmission suggests that these events could play a role in determining whether the cell will survive (11Lee J-M. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W.

The synaptic mitochondrion, as the oxygen-sensing organelle, could control this decision. A variety of lines of evidence indicate that proteins found in, or associated with, mitochondrial membranes participate in responses of a cell to environmental stimuli. BCL-2 family proteins that are either activators or inhibitors of programmed cell death are believed to exert their actions, at least in part, by controlling the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane to cytochrome c and other apoptosis-inducing factors, perhaps by regulating the opening of ion channels (16Kluck R.M Bossy-Wetzel E Green D.R Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4273) Google Scholar, 17Schendel S.L Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ion channels, such as those regulated by the BCL-2 family protein BCL-xL, may also control the export of metabolites including ATP under normal physiological conditions (18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I. Fannjiang Y McCarthy E. Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Vander Heiden M.G.

A. 2002; 99: 12801-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, injection of ATP into run-down synapses causes the return of synaptic transmission (18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I. Fannjiang Y McCarthy E. Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that BCL-xL is present in mitochondrial membranes of the giant presynaptic terminal of adult squid (18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I. Fannjiang Y McCarthy E. Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When recombinant human BCL-xL is applied directly to the outer mitochondrial membrane, it results in the induction of intermediate size channels with conductances of ∼200–500 pS. 1The abbreviations used are: pS, picosiemens; nS, nanosiemens; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone.1The abbreviations used are: pS, picosiemens; nS, nanosiemens; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. In general, proteases are activated during ischemia (20Tanaka H. Yokota H. Jover T. Cappuccio I. Calderone A. Simionescu M. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2750-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and other types of brain injury (21Sullivan P.G. Keller J.N. Bussen W.L. Scheff S.W. Brain Res. 2002; 949: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and inhibition of caspase activity protects against ischemic brain injury (22Gillardon F. Kiprianova I. Sandkuhler J.

Anesthesiology. 2004; 101: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings in mammalian brain, levels of BCL-xL decline in squid synaptic mitochondria during hypoxia, and this decline is blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) (24Jonas E.A. Hickman J.A. Mushtaque C. Polster B.M. Brandt T.A. Yihru Fannjiang I. Ivanovska G.B. Kinnally K. Zimmberg J Hardwick J. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13590-13595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Application of a naturally occurring proteolytic cleavage fragment of BCL-xL to mitochondria in the squid presynaptic terminal results in the formation of large conductance channels. The conductance of these channels (up to 3.8 nS) is larger than those produced by BCL-xL itself (24Jonas E.A. Hickman J.A. Mushtaque C. Polster B.M. Brandt T.A. Yihru Fannjiang I. Ivanovska G.B. Kinnally K. Zimmberg J Hardwick J. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13590-13595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and they are inhibited by NADH, a known inhibitor of outer mitochondrial membrane permeability (25Lee A.C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that specific proteolytic cleavage of BCL-xL could play a role in regulating synaptic function during hypoxia. Direct evidence for the activation of BCL-2 family proteins or other mitochondrial channel activity in neurons after a pathological insult such as ischemia, however, is still lacking. In this study, we used an intracellular patch clamp technique to record the activity of mitochondrial membranes in an intact presynaptic terminal. We found that several minutes of hypoxia caused the appearance of novel multiconductance channel activity. The appearance of hypoxia-induced channels was correlated in time with the deterioration of synaptic responses, suggesting that the two events may be linked functionally. NADH attenuated the hypoxia-induced channel activity and potentiated synaptic transmission under hypoxic conditions. The appearance of the hypoxia-induced channels was also attenuated by Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that proteolysis contributes to the induction of channel activity during hypoxia. In addition, Z-VAD-fmk attenuated the hypoxia-induced decline in synaptic function. Our experiments support the hypothesis that an increase in outer mitochondrial channel activity is a very early event in the response of a neuron to hypoxia. Intracellular Membrane Patch Clamp Recordings—Experiments were performed on small Loligo pealii at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA, as described previously (26Jonas E.A. Knox R.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1997; 19: 7-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I.

In brief, isolated squid stellate ganglia were pinned to Sylgard in a Lucite chamber. The bathing solution (in mm: 466 NaCl, 54 MgCl2, 11 CaCl2, 10 KCl, 3 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2) was cooled, oxygenated with 99.5% O2, 0.5% CO2, and perfused over the ganglia. During experiments to induce hypoxia, perfusion was stopped. Intracellular membrane pipettes (20–80 megohms) were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mm): 570 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.07 EGTA, 0.046 CaCl2, and 2 ATP, pH 7.2. The mitochondrial patch electrode was contained in an outer, ensheathing electrode that was used to enter the terminal, after which the outer electrode was retracted, exposing the patch pipette tip (for more detailed methods, see Ref. 26Jonas E.A. Knox R.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1997; 19: 7-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Gigaohm seals formed either spontaneously or in response to slight negative pressure. The polarities of potentials reported here refer to those of the patch pipette relative to that of the ground electrode, which was placed in the external medium. Injection of Presynaptic Terminal and Measurement of Postsynaptic Responses—Intracellular microinjection pipettes were filled with intracellular squid solution and were inserted into the presynaptic terminal. Synaptic transmission was evoked by stimulating an external suction electrode attached to the presynaptic nerve. The nerve was stimulated at 0.033 Hz, 20 V, 0.01 ms to elicit single action potentials. The postsynaptic responses were recorded by an electrode containing 3 m KCl inserted into the postsynaptic nerve. Transmitter release was measured by recording the initial rate of rise of the postsynaptic response (27Swandulla D. Hans M. Zipser K. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 1991; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Morgan J.R Prasad K. Jin S. Augustine G.J. Lafer E.M.

Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial rates of increase of the postsynaptic responses were calculated using pClamp 8.0 Clampfit software (Axon Instruments) by placing a cursor at the first onset of the synaptic response, determined by eye, and a second cursor at a time point 100–300 μs later, before any detectable regenerative response occurred. For experiments in which NADH was injected into the presynaptic terminal, the microelectrodes were filled with 140 mm NADH in intracellular solution. Pulses of positive pressure (20–40 p.s.i., 100 ms) were given with a Picospritzer (General Valve, Parker Hannifin Corporation). To produce hypoxic conditions, the perfusion of the stellate ganglion with oxygenated seawater was stopped. To determine the levels of oxygen in the medium under these conditions, measurements of oxygen levels were made with an oxygen electrode (Hansatech, Norfolk, UK). In the presence of ganglia, the oxygen content of the medium decreased by 48.1 ± 1.1% (n = 3) from 320 to 166 nmol/ml in 20 min (24Jonas E.A. Hickman J.A. Mushtaque C. Polster B.M. Brandt T.A. Yihru Fannjiang I. Ivanovska G.B. Kinnally K. Zimmberg J Hardwick J. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13590-13595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Hypoxia Produces Run-down of Synaptic Transmission—To determine whether hypoxia alters mitochondrial membrane activity in a living neuron, we used the giant synapse of the squid stellate ganglion as a model system. The dissected synaptic preparation is very sensitive to hypoxia and requires a continuous flow of oxygenated seawater to maintain a responsive synapse. Cessation of the seawater perfusion usually causes an attenuation of synaptic transmission over the next 10–30 min (Fig. 1a). To show this, recordings were made from the postsynaptic axon while stimulating the presynaptic nerve once every 30 s under hypoxic conditions. The amount of neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic neuron was estimated by measuring the rate of increase of the postsynaptic potential that precedes a triggered action potential. In response to hypoxia, the mean half-time for the decrease in postsynaptic responses was 9.75 ± 1.18 min (n = 17). After re-oxygenation, recovery from this hypoxia-induced synaptic run-down was variable from synapse to synapse. After 40 min or more of hypoxia, many synapses failed to recover after restoration of oxygenation. The mean percentage recovery of synaptic responses, measured 20 min after the start of re-oxygenation, was 2.4 ± 2.4%, compared with values measured prior to the onset of hypoxia (n = 8).Fig. 1Induction of multiconductance channel activity on mitochondrial membranes by hypoxia. a, loss of synaptic responses at the squid stellate ganglion giant synapse during hypoxia. Left panel shows representative traces of postsynaptic responses recorded prior to (control) and 5 min and 10 min after cessation of perfusion with oxygenated medium. The initial rate of rise of the postsynaptic potential (PSP) declines over time and, by 10 min, fails to reach threshold for an action potential. The time course in the right panel shows an example of rapid decline in the rate of rise of the postsynaptic response after cessation of perfusion of the preparation with oxygenated medium. b, a comparison of channel activity on mitochondrial membranes recorded at +100 mV before and 40 min after cessation of perfusion of oxygenated seawater.

N represents the number of events (y axis) detected at the indicated current amplitude (x axis). In the control (left), the peak represents the amplitude of the base-line (leak) current. In the right panel, the base line is now a small proportion of the total points that make up the histogram and can be seen as a small peak at the left of the trace. The major peak in the histogram represents an intermediate conductance, and the smaller peak at the right side of the histogram represents those events contributed by large conductance openings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hypoxia Induces Multiconductance Channel Activity in Synaptic Mitochondria—Patch clamp recordings of channel activity on mitochondria in intact squid presynaptic terminals were carried out using a concentric electrode configuration described previously (26Jonas E.A. Knox R.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1997; 19: 7-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I. Fannjiang Y McCarthy E. Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic studies of the presynaptic terminal and of the patch pipettes have shown that mitochondria are the predominant organelles within the body of the terminal and that these are the only organelles in which the size is compatible with the size of the patch pipette tips (29Jonas E.A. Buchanan J. Kaczmarek L.K. Science. 1999; 286: 1347-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In previous studies using this approach to record the activity on mitochondria in unstimulated normoxic presynaptic terminals we found that discrete increases in current across the mitochondrial membrane were relatively infrequent and, when they occurred, typically had amplitudes of less than 18 pA (at a pipette potential of –100 or +100 mV). By recording these events at different potentials, it was found that the most prevalent activity in controls had a conductance of <180 pS (18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I. Fannjiang Y McCarthy E. Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jonas E.A. Buchanan J. Kaczmarek L.K. Science. 1999; 286: 1347-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similar to these earlier results, we found that the most prevalent ion channel activity in control recordings followed for up to 1 h in ganglia perfused with oxygenated seawater had a conductance of <180 pS (n = 16) (Fig. 1b, left). The overall probability of opening of larger conductances (>180 pS) was very small (<0.02). In contrast to controls, hypoxic treatment induced mitochondrial channel activities with a much greater amplitude in 10 of the 16 cells tested (p < 0.0004, Fisher's exact test) (Fig. 1b, right). Typically, these larger events had several different current amplitudes that changed throughout the recording. The mean delay from the time of withdrawal of oxygenated medium to the onset of the larger multiconductance channel activity was 12.8 ± 2.7 min, and, in some experiments, large channel activity could be detected as early as 5 min after the onset of hypoxia. To better characterize the induced channel activity, the size distribution of the various channel openings in these recordings was determined and represented as amplitude histograms (Fig. 1c). Discrete peaks in the amplitude histograms represent the closed state (the peak found at ∼30 pA in Fig. 1c, left panel) and various levels of channel openings in the mitochondrial membranes of the control and hypoxic neurons. Fig. 1c shows amplitude histograms for 1-min periods of recording before and after induction of hypoxia. Two major peaks in the amplitude histogram from the recording made after induction of hypoxia are labeled “intermediate” and “large.” The amplitudes of the peaks in these histograms were not integral multiples of a single unitary conductance. This suggests that the openings do not represent the openings of many channels all of which have the same conductance (30Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Instead, the finding suggests that one channel may be able to produce different levels of current amplitude or that several different types of channel activity are induced by hypoxia within each patch. Our data support the hypothesis that hypoxia induces channels with multiple different conductances rather than the opening of several independent types of channels. In particular, we found that the conductance of a channel could remain stable for periods of time lasting for tens of seconds and then could change abruptly to a new level concomitantly with the disappearance of the previous level (Fig. 2). Such events are very unlikely to occur simultaneously for several independent channels in a patch. Thus, in 1 min of continuous recording, different conductance levels could be detected in successive amplitude histograms covering each 10 s of the recording (Fig. 2). To provide an accurate measure of the hypoxia-induced channel conductances and to compare them with those of channels induced by proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (24Jonas E.A. Hickman J.A. Mushtaque C. Polster B.M. Brandt T.A. Yihru Fannjiang I. Ivanovska G.B. Kinnally K. Zimmberg J Hardwick J. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13590-13595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we determined the current-voltage relationships for the hypoxia-induced channels. This relationship between the amplitude of discrete channel openings and the membrane voltage was obtained by rapidly stepping the holding potential across a range of voltages during a series of openings at one conductance level. The majority of openings had current-voltage relationships that were approximately linear, with a reversal potential close to 0 mV (Fig. 3a). No systematic dependence of the probability of channel opening on the holding voltage was detected. In a minority of cases, however, smaller amplitude openings induced by hypoxia, corresponding to conductances less than ∼300 pS, had current-voltage relationships that were outwardly rectifying (Fig. 3b). In general, amplitude histograms of channel activity in the hypoxic neurons demonstrated the induction of discrete conductances between 180 pS and 2.0 nS. To compare all of the independent experiments, we divided channel openings into three groups according to their conductance (18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I. Fannjiang Y McCarthy E. Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jonas E.A. Hickman J.A. Mushtaque C. Polster B.M. Brandt T.A. Yihru Fannjiang I. Ivanovska G.B. Kinnally K. Zimmberg J Hardwick J. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13590-13595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These groups were selected based on peaks of amplitude histograms such as those shown in Fig. 1c. Small openings were defined as those with conductances <180 pS, and these comprise the majority of openings in control recordings. Intermediate conductances were defined as those between 180 pS and 760 pS, whereas large conductances were defined as greater than 760 pS. Channel activity produced by hypoxia underwent reversible transitions between intermediate and large conductance levels. Frequently, one channel opened and closed repeatedly to a single amplitude level for periods of time lasting tens of seconds (Fig. 3c). For each experiment, the proportion of time spent at these conductance levels was determined prior to hypoxia and at the time of maximally induced channel activity within 30 min of the onset of hypoxia. Prior to the onset of hypoxia, the majority of channel openings were <180 pS (small). In contrast, after the induction of channel activity, the majority of the openings were intermediate or large, and channels were less likely to remain closed (Fig. 3d). Channels Induced by Hypoxia Are Attenuated by NADH—It is likely that the membrane contacted by the patch pipette in these squid preparations is the outer mitochondrial membrane because the gigaohm seals were formed directly on intracellular organelles within the presynaptic nerve cell endings. To provide further evidence, the effect of NADH addition was determined. The conductance of mitochondrial outer membranes has been shown previously to be reduced by millimolar concentrations of NADH (25Lee A.C. Zizi M. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Colombini M. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 169-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In lipid bilayers, NADH has also been shown to reduce the conductance of the voltage-dependent anion channel, a relatively non-selective channel that is believed to be the major conductance pathway across the outer membrane (31Colombini M. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 169-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, a pro-apoptotic proteolytic cleavage fragment of BCL-xL produces large conductance mitochondrial channel openings that are attenuated by NADH both in the squid presynaptic terminal and in isolated yeast mitochondria (24Jonas E.A. Hickman J.A. Mushtaque C. Polster B.M. Brandt T.A. Yihru Fannjiang I. Ivanovska G.B. Kinnally K. Zimmberg J Hardwick J. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13590-13595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of this agent on the induction of channel activity by hypoxia in the presynaptic terminal. Inclusion of 1 mm NADH in the patch pipette before and after induction of hypoxia greatly reduced the probability of occurrence of the large conductance activity (n = 5, Fig. 4a). NADH Inhibits Synaptic Run-down and Restores Synaptic Responses during Hypoxia—Because NADH alters the ability of the outer mitochondrial membrane to flux ions and metabolites, we reasoned that NADH may affect the strength of synaptic transmission. Release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic terminal is known be influenced by the functional state of mitochondria. Mitochondria buffer intracellular calcium and other ions and produce the ATP necessary for repetitive synaptic events, activities that could be substantially altered in the presence of an agent that changes mitochondrial membrane properties. If the large conductance channels induced by hypoxia contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunction that results in decline in synaptic activity, then inhibition of these channels by NADH should alter the rate of synaptic run-down. Indeed, we found that intracellular injection of NADH (140 mm in the pipette) into the presynaptic terminal during the onset of hypoxia caused a transient enhancement of synaptic responses (39.6 ± 13.4% increase, n = 8) that endured for several minutes (10.15 ± 3.43 min) (Fig. 4b). The NADH injections delayed, but did not fully block, the ultimate elimination of synaptic responses caused by oxygen deprivation when stimulating at 0.033 Hz. Because of the transient nature of the effect of NADH injection on synaptic responses, we assayed the effects of NADH injection on the rate of synaptic run-down in a paradigm that produces depression more rapidly. The presynaptic terminal was stimulated at a frequency of 2 Hz, which produces a depression in synaptic responses even under normoxic conditions (27Swandulla D. Hans M. Zipser K. Augustine G.J. Neuron. 1991; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). After cessation of oxygenation, the mean half-time for run-down of synaptic responses at this frequency was 1.76 ± 1.13 min (n = 4). If the presynaptic terminal was preinjected with NADH immediately prior to cessation of oxygenation, the mean half-time for run-down was lengthened to almost 7 min (n = 5, p < 0.05, Fig. 4e). In addition, as at 0.033 Hz, repeated injection of NADH during stimulation at 2 Hz produced an enhancement of synaptic responses even under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4d). In a further study at 0.033 Hz, NADH injections also affected the reversibility of hypoxic run-down. At 20 min of reperfusion of synaptic preparations with oxygenated seawater, there was a significant increase in the extent of recovery of the rate of increase of postsynaptic potentials (57.6 ± 38.2%, n = 5) compared with non-injected synapses (2.4 + 2.4%, n = 8, p < 0.03). Injection of NADH may have direct metabolic effects as well as effects on the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. We, therefore, tested the effects of NADH injection in the presence of rotenone (10 μm). This agent blocks the metabolic functions of NADH by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) (32Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Testa C.M. Seo B.B. Richardson J.R. Kim J.H. Miller G.W. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10756-10764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During synaptic run-down produced by hypoxia in the presence of rotenone, NADH injection into the presynaptic terminal caused a transient enhancement of synaptic responses that endured for several minutes (n = 3, Fig. 4c). These findings imply that NADH can affect synaptic function independently of its actions at complex I, possibly by inhibiting the increase in outer membrane conductance that occurs with hypoxia. Z-VAD-fmk Inhibits Induction of the Hypoxia Channel and Slows Synaptic Run-down—Increases in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane occur during programmed cell death and are controlled by BCL-2 family proteins. It is known that cleavage of several BCL-2 family proteins, including BCL-xL, by proteases during programmed cell death enhances or activates their pro-death function (33Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G.

In the squid stellate ganglion, we showed previously that hypoxia induces proteolysis of native BCL-xL and that a proteolytic fragment of this protein produces large conductance channel activity when applied to mitochondrial membranes (24Jonas E.A. Hickman J.A. Mushtaque C. Polster B.M. Brandt T.A. Yihru Fannjiang I. Ivanovska G.B. Kinnally K. Zimmberg J Hardwick J. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13590-13595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether proteases facilitate the large channel openings that are triggered by hypoxia, the ganglion was pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm), a caspase/calpain inhibitor that inhibits the hypoxia-induced cleavage of BCL-xL. Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) was included in the recording pipette. Treatment with Z-VAD-fmk potently inhibited the appearance of the large hypoxia-induced channels on mitochondria (Fig. 5a). In eight of eight experiments, no large conductance (>760 pS) channels were detected during recordings lasting for 27–47 min, except in one experiment in which such channel activity was observed only transiently at 22 min after the onset of hypoxia. We also tested the effects of Z-VAD-fmk on the rate of run-down of synaptic responses produced by hypoxia. Treatment of ganglia with 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk during hypoxia significantly slowed the rate of run-down of synaptic responses, lengthening the mean half-time for the decrease in responses from 9.75 ± 1.18 min to 34.35 ± 12.71 min (n = 6, p < 0.004, Fig. 5, b and c). Understanding the basic cellular mechanisms that operate during hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is of utmost importance in designing preventative treatments. Previous work has indicated that protease activation and increased levels of pro-death BCL-2 family members occur during ischemic injury and that run-down of neurotransmission is one of the earliest events in hypoxic injury to a neuron (41Martinou J.C. Dubois-Dauphin M. Staple J.K. Rodriguez I. Frankowski H. Missotten M. Albertini P. Talabot D. Catsicas S. Pietra C. Huarte J.

Krnjevic K. Neuroscience. 2002; 113: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). By recording intact mitochondria in a living terminal, we have now found that within a few minutes of the onset of hypoxia, a death stimulus to neurons, multiconductance channel activity is induced in mitochondrial membranes and that this occurs during the run-down of synaptic transmission. It is likely that our recordings represent channel events primarily occurring in the outer mitochondrial membrane, because no steps were taken to disrupt the outer membrane. Findings from a previous study also indicate that mitochondrial channel activity may be induced by a death stimulus (46Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It was found that the macroscopic conductance of isolated mitochondria prepared from hematopoietic cells undergoing serum deprivation was larger than that of control cells. Although unitary channel activity could not be discerned in that study, large multiconductance activity could be detected in proteoliposomes prepared from the apoptotic cells, raising the possibility that such activity also occurs in live cells. We have found previously that the BCL-2 family protein BCL-xL is present on mitochondria in the adult squid presynaptic terminal (18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I. Fannjiang Y McCarthy E. Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Injection of this anti-apoptotic protein into the terminal produces an enhancement of synaptic transmission. Conversely, injection of ΔN BCL-xL, the naturally occurring cleavage product of BCL-xL, causes run-down of synaptic transmission, similar to that shown here during hypoxia (18Jonas E.A. Hoit D. Hickman J.A. Zhang J. Brandt T.A. Yin D. Ivanovska I. Fannjiang Y McCarthy E. Hardwick J.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8423-8431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of BCL-xL occurs during hypoxia, and application of ΔN BCL-xL to mitochondria produces large conductance channels (300 pS–3.4 nS) similar to those produced by hypoxia. Thus, it is possible that the large conductance channels detected during hypoxia represent the action of endogenous BCL-xL that has undergone proteolytic cleavage on mitochondrial membranes. The facts that the appearance of hypoxia-induced channel activity is attenuated by pretreatment with Z-VAD-fmk, which attenuates BCL-xL cleavage, and that the channel activity is inhibited by NADH, which also inhibits ΔN BCL-xL-induced large conductance channel activity, are consistent with this hypothesis. Nevertheless, we cannot eliminate the possibility that hypoxia induces large conductance channel activity through an entirely different mechanism with similar pharmacological properties. The findings that NADH enhances synaptic responses and that NADH and Z-VAD-fmk attenuate the run-down of synaptic transmission during hypoxia are consistent with the hypothesis that the induction of large conductance mitochondrial channel activity is causally linked to the decrement in neurotransmission. This could occur, for example, if the channel activity were associated with a loss of membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane, leading to a loss of ATP production. Alternatively, the efflux of cytochrome c or other factors in the intermembrane space through a large conductance pathway in the outer membrane could compromise mitochondrial function or trigger biochemical reactions in the presynaptic cytoplasm. We attempted to determine whether the actions of NADH on enhancing synaptic responses during hypoxia were consistent with its actions on mitochondrial membrane permeability rather than resulting from the metabolism of NADH. We injected NADH in the presence of rotenone, an agent that prevents metabolism of NADH by inhibiting complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Our finding that enhancement of transmission by NADH could still be detected in the presence of rotenone is consistent with the hypothesis that NADH acts directly, perhaps by inhibiting mitochondrial outer membrane conductance. Nevertheless, although the correlation of the effects of both Z-VAD-fmk and NADH on mitochondrial channel activity and on synaptic transmission during hypoxia is a striking one, we cannot at present definitively establish the mode of action of these agents on neurotransmitter release during hypoxia. Previous work has shown that certain forms of synaptic plasticity are associated with changes in mitochondrial membrane conductance (29Jonas E.A. Buchanan J. Kaczmarek L.K. Science. 1999; 286: 1347-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies on mammalian synapses have indicated that hypoxia may produce its effects on synaptic depression, in part, by altering the release of ATP and adenosine from presynaptic terminals (47Sebastiao A.M. de Mendonca A. Moreira T. Ribeiro J.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8564-8571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Aihara H. Fujiwara S. Mizuta I. Tada H. Kanno T. Tozaki H. Nagai K. Yajima Y. Inoue K. Kondoh T. Motooka Y.

Our present findings suggest that a change in conductance of mitochondrial membranes is one of the earliest events in the neuronal response to hypoxia and suggest that the induced channel activity is closely linked to the change in transmission, perhaps by altering the flux of ATP, calcium, or other factors close to sites of exocytosis. A change in the permeability of mitochondrial membranes produced by hypoxia may also be linked to the apoptosis pathways that will eventually determine if a neuron will live or die after a hypoxic-ischemic insult.

https://openalex.org/W2124930067,"The constitutive active receptor (CAR) regulates the induction of the cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) gene by phenobarbital-type inducers, such as 1,4 bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) via the distal phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module (PBREM, at –1732/–1685 bp). Activation of the PBREM by TCPOBOP generated a 10-fold induction of CYP2B6 mRNA in HepG2 cells stably expressing mouse CAR (Ym17). Co-treatment with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) synergistically increased this induction over 100-fold without directly activating CAR or the PBREM. Although OA synergy required the presence of PBREM, deletion assays delineated the OA-responsive activity to a proximal 24-bp (–256/–233) sequence (OARE) in the CYP2B6 promoter. CAR did not directly bind to the OARE in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. However, both DNA affinity and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a significant increase in CAR association with the OARE after co-treatment with TCPOBOP and OA, indicating the indirect binding of CAR to the OARE. The two cis-acting elements, the distal PBREM and the proximal OARE, within the chromatin structure are both regulated by CAR in response to TCPOBOP and OA, respectively, to maximally induce the CYP2B6 promoter. This functional interaction between the two sites expands the current understanding of the mechanism of CAR-mediated inducible transcription.

As a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), CAR binds to direct repeats of nuclear receptor half-sites, such as the NR1 within the distal 51-bp PB-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) of Cyp2b10, and activates transcription (1Honkakoski P.

Experiments with transgenic mice bearing a mutated PBREM have confirmed that it is an essential enhancer element (8Ramsden R. Beck N.B. Sommer K.M. Omiecinski C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, several PB-responsive DNA elements have been reported in the proximal promoters of CYP2B genes, but their role as enhancer elements in PB induction is controversial (reviewed in Ref. 9Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 1998; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact mechanism how CAR regulates inducible transcription still remains elusive. Signal transduction has been repeatedly suggested to regulate PB induction. Various inhibitors of protein kinases or phosphatases often repress PB induction in hepatocytes (10Corcos L. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 89: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Translocation of CAR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is an essential step in PB induction (6Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to involve a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade (11Yoshinari K. Kobayashi K. Moore R. Kawamoto T. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) effectively repressed the induction by PB of CYP2B genes in rodent primary hepatocytes (12Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1122-1129PubMed Google Scholar) by preventing CAR nuclear translocation (6Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, distinct activation processes occur in the nucleus, for example the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibitor KN-62 repressed the induction of CYP2B10 by PB in mouse primary hepatocytes despite CAR accumulation in the nucleus (14Marc N. Galisteo M. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Fautrel A. Joannard F. Guillouzo A. Corcos L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Yamamoto Y. Kawamoto T. Negishi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is possible that CAR interacts with other factors in the nucleus that are the target of phosphorylation because direct phosphorylation of CAR has not, as yet, been reported. Indirect mechanisms of gene induction by nuclear receptors, including the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), RXR, and the glucocorticoid receptor, independent of nuclear receptor half-site activation, have been reported previously (16Froeschle A. Alric S. Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Aurade F. Rochette-Egly C. Bonnieu A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Stoecklin E. Wissler M. Moriggl R. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6708-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) but no such mechanism has been reported for CAR at present. Dissecting the CAR-mediated response has been challenging because in transformed cell lines CAR spontaneously accumulates in the nucleus and is constitutively active (6Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we used a stable line (Ym17) of HepG2 cells that express mouse CAR-V5-His primarily in the nucleus that can be effectively activated by CAR ligands. These cells provided an opportunity to examine directly the function of the receptor in the nucleus, independent of translocation, and are an excellent system for investigating the nuclear effects of inhibitors (e.g. OA) on CAR-mediated transcription. Here we present experimental considerations to reveal the role of a proximal region of the CYP2B6 gene in synergistically up-regulating CAR-mediated transcription in response to TCPOBOP and OA. These investigations shed light on a unique role for a proximal sequence in maximizing PB-type induction and identify a novel role for CAR in the formation of a proximal protein-DNA complex.

Cloning and Plasmid—The 1.8-kbp 5′-flanking DNA of the CYP2B6 gene was cloned between the KpnI and XhoI sites of basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic (–1.8k-pGL3). To construct deletions, either proper fragments were generated from the 1.8-kbp DNA using convenient restriction sites or from the –1.8k-pGL3 plasmid using the Stratagene QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Cedar Creek, TX) and specific primers spanning the excised bases (and containing the insert sequence for UGT256233). Full-length mouse CAR cDNA was cloned into pBIND vector (pBIND-mCAR). All constructs were verified by their sequences. Cell Culture—Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 unit/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin). Ym17 cells, a stable cell line that expressed mCAR, and Yh18 cells, a stable cell line that expressed hCAR, were established from HepG2 cells that were transfected with a mouse or human pcDNA3.1-CAR-V5-His expression vector, respectively, and were selected for neomycin resistance. During cell treatment, OA was added to the culture medium 30 min before treatment with a given chemical inducer. RT-PCR—Total RNA isolation and subsequent synthesis of first strand cDNA were performed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and SuperScript™ preamplification system (Invitrogen), respectively. The resulting cDNA was subjected to semi-quantitative real time PCR using an ABI Prism 7700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer and probe sets used for PCR analysis were as follows: CYP2B6 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, 5′-AAGCGGATTTGTCTTGGTGAA-3′, 5′-TGGAGGATGGTGGTGAAGAAG-3′, and probe 6FAM-CATCGCCCGTGCGGAATTGTTC-TAMRA; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), 5′-GGCCCATCATGCCCAATAT-3′, 5′-TTCAAATTCCTGGGATAGTGGATT-3′, and 6FAM-TTTTTGTTGGTGGAATCAACTGCCTTCACTAMRA; CYP3A7, 5′-CCCAATTCTTGAAGCATTAAATATCAC-3′, 5′-GGCCATGAGCTCCAGATCA-3′, and 6FAM-CAGATAAAAGAAGGTCG-MGB; superoxide dismutase (SOD3), 5′-GCGGAGCCCAACTCTGACT-3′, 5′-GCATGACCTCCTGCCAGATC-3′, and 6FAM-CCGAGACATGTACGCCAAGGTCACG-TAMRA. The quantity of mRNA was normalized by β-actin mRNA and measured by using a Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay for human β-actin (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Transfection Assays—For transient transfection assays, Ym17 or Yh18 cells in 24-well plates were co-transfected with a given pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-SV40 plasmid (0.1 μg/well each) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method using CellPhect Transfection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were treated with chemical inducers. Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The receptor-dependent enhancer activity was determined based on firefly luciferase activity normalized against Renilla luciferase activity, except for the Ym17S15 cells when firefly luciferase activity was normalized against protein concentration (μg/ml). Protein concentration was measured at 595 nm using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad).

Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) for 25 min with 5 μg of protein to 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to –252/–237 bp of the CYP2B6 5′-flanking region (5′-catgACCCACACATTCACTT-3′) or to the NR1 motif from the Cyp2b10 PBREM (5′-gatcTCTGTACTTTCCTGACCTTG-3′). DNA Affinity Chromatography—For affinity purification of CAR, Dynabeads® M-280 streptavidin (Dynal ASA, Oslo, Norway) conjugated with multiple copies of the wild-type or mutant (5′-catgACCCAAAAAAACACTT-3′)–252/–237-bp oligonucleotide were prepared as described previously (1Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Na2MO4. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—6 × 106 Ym17 cells per treatment group were incubated with TCPOBOP (250 nm) and/or OA (10 nm) for 24 h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay kit (Upstate Biotechnologies, Charlottesville, VA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and adapted as follows. Proteins and DNA were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in the media for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected in 450 μl of SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors aprotinin (1 μg/ml), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 μm), and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml) and were sonicated at power 10 for five 10-s pulses using the Misonix Microson™ XL 2000 ultrasonic cell disrupter. The sonication was optimized as described in the ChIP assay kit instructions and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine generation of DNA fragments between 200 and 1000 bp in length, which avoided nonspecific immunoprecipitation of the OARE via cross-linking of CAR to the PBREM. The diluted lysates were precleared by incubation with 160 μl of protein A-agarose salmon sperm slurry, 60 μl of normal mouse IgG, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose was collected by centrifugation at 100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. 1 ml of the cleared fraction was subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation with either 5 μg of V5 antibody, 5 μg of normal mouse IgG, or no antibody at 4 °C. 1 ml was retained as an input sample for each treatment group. The immunoprecipitated complexes were recovered, washed, and eluted; the cross-links were reversed and proteins digested as described in the manufacturer's protocol. A phenol chloroform/ethanol precipitation method purified the DNA with a final resuspension in 45 μl of water. The DNA was amplified by real time PCR as described under “RT-PCR” using a specific primer and probe set designed to span the OARE between –287 and –193-bp upstream of the CYP2B6 transcription start site, with the probe located within the OARE sequence. This amplicon was specific for the OARE and did not contain other CAR-binding sites within the CYP2B6 gene, such as the PBREM. The OARE 5′- and 3′-primers were 5′-CAAAAATAGACATACATATACCCACAAACC-3′ and 5′-ATTGGCAGGGATACAGTGGTAGAG-3′, respectively, and the probe was 6FAM-CACTTGCTCACCTGGACT-MGB. The precipitated DNA levels were normalized to the input levels using the following equation (2[caret]Ctinput – Ctprecipitate). Synergistic Induction of the CYP2B6 Gene—In Ym17 cells, the endogenous CYP2B6 gene was induced by TCPOBOP 8–10-fold (Fig. 1a). Unexpectedly, 24 h of co-treatment with OA and TCPOBOP synergistically up-regulated the induction more than 100-fold. OA alone induced CYP2B6 mRNA only 3-fold. This synergistic up-regulation became greater in a time-dependent fashion as the induction by TCPOBOP increased (Fig. 1b) but was not observed in normal HepG2 cells, indicating mCAR was essential for synergistic induction (Fig. 1a). The mRNAs of CAR-regulated UGT1A1, CYP3A7, and SOD3 genes (4Ueda A. Hamadeh H.K. Webb H.K. Yamamoto Y. Sueyoshi T. Afshari C.A. Lehmann J.M. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 20Sugatani J. Kojima H. Ueda A. Kakizaki S. Yoshinari K. Gong Q.H. Owens I.S. Negishi M. Sueyoshi T. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) were increased by TCPOBOP in Ym17 cells, yet no synergistic up-regulation was observed following co-treatment with OA (Fig. 2a). Thus, OA-dependent synergistic induction occurred specifically in the CYP2B6 gene. OA-dependent synergistic up-regulation, however, was not TCPOBOP-specific and may be a general phenomenon occurring in the CYP2B6 gene in response to PB-type inducers because induction by CPZ and E2 was also synergistically up-regulated from 2- and 4-fold to 27- and 57-fold, respectively, in the presence of OA (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2a, no synergistic induction of the UGT1A1, CYP3A7, and SOD3 genes. Ym17 cells were treated with TCPOBOP (250 nm) and/or OA (10 nm) for 24 h. b, synergistic induction by co-treatment with OA and CPZ or E2. Ym17 cells were treated with CPZ (10 μm) or E2 (10 μm) with or without OA (10 nm) for 24 h. Total cellular RNAs were prepared from the treated cells and subjected to quantitative real time RT-PCR of UGT1A1, CYP3A7, SOD3, or CYP2B6 mRNA. The levels of target gene mRNAs were normalized by the β-actin mRNA levels, and fold induction was calculated relative to the levels in Me2SO (DMSO)-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Role of OA in Synergistic Induction—To determine whether OA directly activated mCAR, a Gal4-based mammalian one-hybrid assay was performed. TCPOBOP enhanced Gal4-reporter activity in HepG2 cells co-transfected with an mCAR-GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion plasmid, whereas additional co-treatment with OA caused no synergistic up-regulation of the reporter gene (Fig. 3a). Thus, OA does not directly regulate mCAR to synergistically induce the CYP2B6 gene. To determine whether OA activated CYP2B6 transcription via the PBREM, a luciferase reporter gene containing five copies of the Cyp2b10 NR1 motif upstream of a thymidine kinase promoter was transfected into Ym17 cells. TCPOBOP enhanced luciferase reporter activity 9-fold, whereas additional co-treatment with OA caused no synergistic up-regulation of the reporter gene (Fig. 3b). However, when the –1.8-kbp 5′-flanking sequence of the CYP2B6 gene that included the PBREM was cloned into a luciferase reporter gene (–1.8k-pGL3) and transfected into Ym17 cells, TCPOBOP activated the reporter gene 3-fold (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the activity was synergistically up-regulated 12-fold after co-treatment with OA (Fig. 3c). The –1.8-kbp DNA fragment retained its ability to be synergistically activated by OA in the presence of TCPOBOP. No synergistic up-regulation of the reporter gene was observed after co-treatment with TCPOBOP and the inactive analogues of OA, nor-okadaone, or okadaol (Fig. 3c). Delineation of OA-responsive Activity—To delineate the cis-acting region of the CYP2B6 gene directly responsible for the synergistic induction, a series of deletion assays were performed. Initially, a large internal deletion from –1685 to –307-bp within the –1.8k-pGL3 reporter gene was made to remove various elements, such as the glucocorticoid receptor element and activator protein-1 conserved in a region of the CYP2B6 gene corresponding to a –1.4/–1.2-kbp region of the rat CYP2B1/2 and mouse Cyp2b10 genes (reviewed in Ref. 9Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 1998; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This joining of the PBREM to the proximal 307-bp (PBREM-307) did not significantly affect the synergy (Fig. 4). However, as expected, the proximal –307-bp sequence alone did not display either activation by TCPOBOP or a synergistic response to OA, indicating that synergy was PBREM- as well as CAR-dependent. Subsequently, deletions were constructed within the context of the –1.8-kbp DNA sequence to investigate the activity in the –306/–35-bp region. Whereas deletion of –125/–35-bp retained the synergistic response, the –306/–35-bp deletion lost significant synergistic activity. The proximal –306/–125-bp region was further dissected by constructing smaller deletions within the context of the –1.8-kbp DNA as follows: –306/–166, –256/–213, and –256/–233-bp (Fig. 4), all of which lost significant OA synergistic activity. Deletions within the –256/–233-bp region, such as the –252/–237-bp deletion in Fig. 4, all lost significant OA synergistic activity. Thus the OA-response element (OARE) was identified as a proximal 24-bp sequence between –256 and –233-bp of the –1.8-kbp DNA. The 51-bp PBREM was placed in front of the –256-bp proximal sequence of –1.8-kbp DNA (PBREM-256), by deleting the –1685/–257-bp fragment (Fig. 4), and was found to retain a significant level of synergistic response to OA, whereas deletion of a further proximal 9 bp (–1685/–247-bp, PBREM-247) lost synergistic activity, further confirming the role of the proximal –256-bp sequence in OA-responsive up-regulation of the –1.8-kbp DNA. Replacement of the OARE within the –1.8k-pGL3 construct with the –256/–233-bp sequence from the nonsynergistic gene UGT1A1 to generate a negative control showed a loss of synergy. This supported the –256/–233-bp region (OARE) as the OA-responsive site. Nuclear Protein Binding to the OARE—To investigate protein interactions with this region, DNase I protection of the –308/–121-bp fragment incubated with TCPOBOP- and OA-treated Ym17 nuclear extracts was performed. A large protected region was observed at –264/–195 bp that included the sequence identified as responsible for OA synergy (Fig. 5, left panel). However no differences in protein binding were evident either with nuclear extracts from treated Ym17 cells or from HepG2 cells (Fig. 5, right panel). To search for a specific binding site, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using probes spanning the OARE (–256/–233-bp) and smaller overlapping regions –256/–247, –252/–237, and –242/–233 bp to dissect any treatment effects on this complex. One protein band showed similar electrophoretic mobility shift profiles for both –256 probes and corresponded to a single signal observed with the –252/–237-bp probe (Fig. 6a, lanes 1 and 3). The protein binding to the –252/237-bp probe increased in the presence of OA (Fig. 6a, lane 5) and was further enhanced in the presence of both TCPOBOP and OA (lane 7). The binding was specific because it was competed by an excess of unlabeled –252/–237-bp probe (Fig. 6a, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Competition increased concentration dependently between 25- and 100-fold excess. For practical reasons, hereafter we will call this putative binding complex OARE-binding protein or OABP.Fig. 6a, treatment and CAR-dependent binding of a nuclear protein to the central region of the OARE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using double-stranded 32P-end-labeled probe –252/–237 with 5 μg of nuclear extracts from Ym17 cells incubated with TCPOBOP (250 nm) with or without OA (10 nm) for 48 h. A specific protein denoted OABP and a nonspecific protein bound to the probe. Specificity of binding was confirmed by competition with 100-fold excess of unlabeled –252/–237 probe. b, no OABP binding from HepG2 nuclear extracts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was as described for a with 5 μg of nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells incubated with TCPOBOP (250 nm) with or without OA (10 nm) for 48 h. c, no direct CAR binding to the OARE. Recombinant mouse CAR-V5-His and human RXRα, generated by TNT® T7 Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay using double-stranded 32P-end-labeled probes –252/–237 or NR1 incubated with 4 μl of the receptors alone or in combination.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Involvement of CAR in OABP Binding—As the OA synergistic up-regulation of CYP2B6 appeared to be CAR-dependent, experiments were designed to investigate the role of CAR in the binding of the OABP protein to –252/–237 bp. First, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by using nuclear extract from HepG2 cells. No specific protein binding was observed for the –252/–237-bp probe, indicating that CAR was necessary for OABP binding (Fig. 6b, lanes 1–3). However, no binding of recombinant mCAR-V5-His or hRXRα to the –252/–237-bp probe was observed, either alone or in combination, despite strong binding of the two receptors in combination with a probe consisting of the Cyp2b10 NR1 motif (Fig. 6c, lane 6), suggesting that CAR did not bind directly to the OARE. To investigate the possibility that CAR interacted indirectly with the OARE and whether the interaction was treatment-dependent, DNA affinity chromatography was performed using magnetic beads with multiple copies of the –252/237-bp wild-type oligonucleotides or mutant oligonucleotides with the central 6 bp mutated, attached by biotinylation, and incubated with Ym17 nuclear extract. 4% of the input nuclear extracts were electrophoresed alongside the eluted fractions and Western-blotted with the V5 antibody to detect the V5-tagged mCAR from Ym17 cells. The eluted fractions from the –252/–237-bp wild-type beads indicated a background CAR association with the –252/–237-bp region in the presence of Me2SO, TCPOBOP, or OA alone (Fig. 7a). However, after co-treatment with TCPOBOP and OA, CAR interaction with the –252/–237-bp region was greatly enhanced. An extremely weak association after a much longer exposure was observed with the mutant beads, which was not changed by treatment. Thus, co-treatment of TCPOBOP and OA significantly increased CAR association with the OARE. To test whether CAR interacted with the endogenous CYP2B6 OARE in Ym17 cells, ChIP assays were performed with V5 antibody. DNA from –287 to –193 bp, encompassing the OARE but not the PBREM,"

This “dosage compensation” is a multistep process that involves epigenetic modifications of chromatin and is induced by the expression of a large non-coding RNA termed Xist. In contrast to protein-coding mRNA molecules, which are free to diffuse and roam the entire nuclear interior, Xist is locally constrained to the territory of inactive X chromosomes by as yet unclear mechanisms. Recent results have suggested a contribution of scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) in the silencing of X-linked genes, maybe by inducing a local change in nuclear architecture. Here, in vivo mobility experiments demonstrate that SAF-A is a component of a highly stable proteinaceous structure in the territory of inactive X chromosomes, which might act as a platform for immobilizing Xist RNA during the maintenance phase of X inactivation.

This “dosage compensation” is a multistep process that involves epigenetic modifications of chromatin and is induced by the expression of a large non-coding RNA termed Xist.

Here, in vivo mobility experiments demonstrate that SAF-A is a component of a highly stable proteinaceous structure in the territory of inactive X chromosomes, which might act as a platform for immobilizing Xist RNA during the maintenance phase of X inactivation. The equal expression of X-linked genes in male and female mammals is achieved by transcriptional silencing of the second copy of the X chromosome in females. Silencing is a complex multistep process that leads to a heterochromatization of most of the inactive X chromosome, which becomes microscopically evident as the Barr body (1Barr M.L. Carr D.H. Acta Cytol. 1962; 6: 34-45PubMed Google Scholar). On the microscopical level, the Barr body has been widely used as a cytogenetic marker to identify cells with an aberrant number of X chromosomes and is usually located close to nucleoli or the nuclear periphery together with other heterochromatic regions. On the molecular level, the processes that lead to silencing of the second X chromosome are induced by expression of a large, non-coding RNA that is essential for inactivation (reviewed in Ref. 2Plath K. Mlynarczyk-Evans S. Nusinow D.A. Panning B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 233-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The gene encoding this RNA, called Xist, is the only known gene that is expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome (3Brown C.J. Hendrich B.D. Rupert J.L. Lafreniere R.G. Xing Y. Lawrence J. Willard H.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 527-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Expression of Xist RNA is the first detectable event in X inactivation, later followed by large scale chromatin remodeling, a series of epigenetic modifications of chromatin such as the lysine methylation of histone H3, hypoacetylation of histone H4, the enrichment of the peculiar histone variant macroH2A, and finally methylation of the DNA itself (4Jeppesen P.

Brockdorff N. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Importantly, even though Xist is present on inactive X chromosomes throughout the life of an organism, it is directly involved in transcriptional silencing only in early embryogenesis. Later, silencing becomes Xist-independent, and the inactive state can be perpetuated by redundant epigenetic mechanisms even in absence of Xist (6Csankovszki G. Nagy A. Jaenisch R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 9Marahrens Y. Loring J. Jaenisch R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Apparently, Xist imparts a chromosomal memory early in development (“initiation phase”), which facilitates histone methylation in Xi during the “maintenance phase” at later times (11Kohlmaier A. Savarese F. Lachner M. Martens J. Jenuwein T. Wutz A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E171Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). During maintenance, the chromosomal memory allows Xist to efficiently establish histone methylation, but Xist is no longer necessary for silencing itself (11Kohlmaier A. Savarese F. Lachner M. Martens J. Jenuwein T. Wutz A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E171Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In both phases, Xist RNA is locally constrained to the territory of the inactive X chromosome (3Brown C.J. Hendrich B.D. Rupert J.L. Lafreniere R.G. Xing Y. Lawrence J. Willard H.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 527-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 12Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), in contrast to almost any other RNA species in the nucleus that freely diffuse and can roam the entire nucleus (13Shav-Tal Y.

Xist remains in the vicinity of its expression site, exclusively spreading in cis to neighboring regions of the same chromosome (but not in trans to non-X chromatin regions that may even be closer), until it essentially “coats” the entire inactive X chromosome. The molecular basis of the very low mobility of Xist, and the mechanism that imparts its local constraint, are currently unclear. Earlier experiments have suggested that diffusion of Xist is prevented by binding to components of a stable proteinaceous substructure of the nucleus (12Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Indeed, we recently demonstrated that scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) 1The abbreviations used are: SAF-A, scaffold attachment factor A; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. 1The abbreviations used are: SAF-A, scaffold attachment factor A; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. is enriched in the territories of the inactive X chromosome (15Helbig R. Fackelmayer F.O. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This protein has earlier been identified and characterized as a DNA- and RNA-binding component of a putative nuclear scaffold (16Romig H. Fackelmayer F.O. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A.

As the enrichment of SAF-A in inactive X territories depends on an intact RNA binding domain on the protein, and the protein can be extracted from Xi by mild RNase (but not DNase) treatment (15Helbig R. Fackelmayer F.O. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), SAF-A is a plausible candidate for a structural protein that might contribute to Xist immobilization. Indeed, the localization of Xist RNA results from cooperative binding of protein factors to redundant low affinity sequence elements (23Wutz A. Rasmussen T.P. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), in exactly the same way in which SAF-A interacts with nucleic acids (24Kipp M. Göhring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Due to the strong self-assembly activity of SAF-A in presence of nucleic acids (25Fackelmayer F.O. Richter A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10416-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Xist RNA and SAF-A might cooperate to form a stable structure in the territory of Xi and provide a self-organizing platform essential for the maintenance of the silenced state of the X chromosome. This paper provides first in vivo evidence in favor of this hypothesis, demonstrating the presence of a stable, locally constrained substructure in inactive X territories. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were cultivated and transfected as described previously (15Helbig R. Fackelmayer F.O. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and cells stably expressing SAF-A:enhanced green fluorescent protein were selected by selection with G418 for 4 weeks. Cells selected for further analysis expressed SAF-A:GFP to less than 5% of the level of endogenous SAF-A to exclude potential problems due to overexpression. Live Cell Microscopy—For live cell microscopy, cells were split onto 35 mm culture dishes with a glass bottom (Mattek), and analyzed 1–2 days after splitting. For the analysis, cells were placed on a heated stage of a Zeiss Meta 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed by bleaching a narrow strip across the nucleus by 20 iterations at 488 nm and 80% laser output. The prebleaching status, bleaching, and fluorescence recovery were recorded by the “time series” module of the Zeiss software (version 3.2), using 1% laser output to minimize further bleaching, 128 × 128-pixel resolution at Zoom factor 3–5, and a 3.5 Airy pinhole. For quantitative analysis, a minimum of 25 individual cells were measured, and mean pixel intensities in specified regions of interest were determined with the freeware image analysis software ImageJ by Wayne Rasband (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) on an Apple MacOs X computer. For comparison of fluorescence recovery in inactive X territories and non-X chromatin regions, the bleaching strip was set to hit an entire Xi in addition to “normal” nuclear regions; for the analysis, two identically sized regions of interest were placed on Xi and a non-X reference region in the bleached area and a non-bleached region for data normalization. For time lapse microscopy, stacks of images recorded by the Zeiss time series module were converted to Quicktime videos (see supplemental material), spanning variable time windows after bleaching. Single territory FRAP was performed by bleaching the entire Xi, and monitoring recovery over time, or in a reverse way by setting two bleaching regions to cover the entire cell except for a single Xi territory. Inactivation of the second copy of the X chromosome is an essential dosage compensation process to equalize the expression of X-linked genes between males and females. The inactivation process depends on the expression and exclusive localization of a 17-kb non-coding RNA, termed Xist, in the territory of the inactive X chromosome (reviewed in Ref. 2Plath K. Mlynarczyk-Evans S. Nusinow D.A. Panning B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 233-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Xist RNA is known to be exempt from free diffusion in the nuclear interior, presumably by interaction with protein components that are enriched in the Xi territory (12Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The immobility of Xist RNA is in striking contrast to all other investigated RNA species, which are free to roam the entire nucleus by passive diffusion (13Shav-Tal Y. Darzacq X. Shenoy S.M. Fusco D. Janicki S.M. Spector D.L. Singer R.H. Science. 2004; 304: 1797-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It is likely that the immobility of Xist is essential to restrict the inactivation process to the right target and prevent illegitimate silencing of non-X chromatin that localizes in the vicinity of Xi. Elucidating the mechanism that constrains the mobility of Xist is therefore important to gain a complete molecular understanding of the X inactivation process and its maintenance. It has been shown that Xist remains detectable even after near-complete removal of chromatin by DNase digestion and salt extraction, suggesting that it is part of a non-chromatin nuclear structure often referred to as “nuclear matrix” or “scaffold” (12Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). However, the existence and functional relevance of such a structure in living cells is a matter of debate, mainly because of the rather harsh procedures usually employed in its isolation. Thus, non-invasive in vivo methods need to be employed to investigate this point beyond experimental flaws. In vivo mobility experiments such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence loss induced by photobleaching, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy can give insights into the mobility of cellular components. To study the mechanism of Xist immobilization, we performed FRAP experiments on SAF-A, a component of the putative nuclear scaffold that is enriched in the territories of inactive X chromosomes (15Helbig R. Fackelmayer F.O. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In other regions of the nucleus, SAF-A is present in several populations that differ in their mobility and has a high immobile fraction of ∼60% of total cellular SAF-A (compare Fig. 1B). When narrow strips containing an entire Xi territory are bleached and monitored for fluorescence recovery over time, Xi and non-X chromatin regions do not differ in the rate of fluorescence recovery (Fig. 1, A and B). This demonstrates that the mobile fraction of SAF-A can enter the Xi territory without any impediment, suggesting that the local viscosity or molecular crowding does not differ between Xi and non-X chromatin. However, the ∼2-fold enrichment of SAF-A in Xi observed in untreated cells is not restored after bleaching. When quantified as an “enrichment recovery,” following the ratio of mean fluorescence of Xi to non-X, there is a marked drop from the normal 2-fold enrichment to 1 (identical intensity after bleaching), which does not “recover” but remains at 1:1 ratio over time (Fig. 1C). Thus, the fluorescence recovers to typical non-Xi levels, but not further, and remains at this level over long periods of time (Fig. 2 and see supplemental movie M1). These results suggest that the enrichment of SAF-A in Xi is due to the presence of a large protein fraction that does not dissociate from Xi, in addition to the background level of mobile SAF-A that is identical in Xi and the rest of the nucleus. The lack of exchange between the stably bound and the soluble fraction is more directly demonstrated in “reverse” territory FRAP, where two large regions of interest where used to bleach the entire nucleus except for the Xi territory (Fig. 3 and supplemental movie M2). In this experiment, the amount of fluorescent SAF-A in Xi drops to approximately half during the bleaching process, indicating the redistribution of the soluble fraction in the entire nucleus, but then stays unchanged for long periods of time. In fact, Xi territories were readily detectable in confocal analysis 2 h after reverse territory FRAP. Thus, binding of SAF-A in the Xi territory is extraordinarily stable, preventing its turnover with the soluble fraction of SAF-A. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first in vivo demonstration of a stable protein structure in the inactive X chromosome territory.Fig. 2Territory photobleaching. In a HEK293 cell with two inactive X chromosomes, SAF-A in one Xi territory was photobleached (arrow) and recovery was investigated over 85 min. Note that the enrichment of SAF-A in the bleached Xi is not re-established even after very long time.

Two large regions were set to photobleach the entire nucleus except for an inactive X territory, to monitor a possible dissociation of SAF-A from Xi over time. A typical cell is shown before and at three time points after bleaching (upper panel); the box indicates the region used for intensity profiling in the lower panel. Note that the mean fluorescence on the inactive X territory is reduced by a factor of approximately two directly after bleaching but does not decrease significantly over time. Intensity peaks are slightly shifted due to movement of the cell.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Combined with earlier findings that SAF-A requires its RNA binding domain for enrichment in Xi (15Helbig R. Fackelmayer F.O. Chromosoma. 2003; 112: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the strong nucleic-acid induced self-assembly of SAF-A to large complexes (18Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Fackelmayer F.O. Richter A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10416-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the data presented here are compatible with a role of SAF-A for the self-organization of a stable structure that immobilizes Xist RNA. While SAF-A is certainly not needed for coating Xi chromatin with Xist, which can bind to chromatin by itself (23Wutz A. Rasmussen T.P. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), such a structure could prevent spreading of Xist RNA in the nuclear interior to confine it to the Xi territory. In addition, the proteinaceous structure formed by SAF-A might act as a platform on which epigenetic modifications occur, especially during the maintenance phase of X inactivation. On first sight, a direct involvement of SAF-A in the initiation process would also appear plausible because SAF-A has recently been shown to physically interact with proteins involved in epigenetic chromatin modifications, such as the histone acetylase p300 (26Martens J.H. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Dorsman J.C. Zantema A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2598-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (27Herrmann F. Bossert M. Schwander A. Akgun E. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48774-48779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, these proteins have been implied in gene (co)activation rather than silencing, a function clearly incompatible with X inactivation. Importantly, though, these proteins are not co-enriched with SAF-A in Xi, 2F. O. Fackelmayer, unpublished observations. and the methylation/acetylation status of histones in Xi indicates that p300 and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 are not active there (28Goto Y. Gomez M. Brockdorff N. Feil R. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2002; 99: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unless an interaction of SAF-A with a component of the silencing cascade that leads to transcriptional inactivation of on X chromosome is convincingly demonstrated, we tend to believe that the structure described in this paper may be important for the maintenance of the silenced state, rather than for its induction. In this scenario, the stable proteinaceous structure containing SAF-A might be part of the “chromosomal memory” mechanism that ensures efficient histone methylation specifically in the territory of Xi (11Kohlmaier A. Savarese F. Lachner M. Martens J. Jenuwein T. Wutz A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E171Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Future experiments will focus on the possible role of SAF-A in this “memory,” and should allow a more detailed understanding of the dosage compensation in mammalian cells.

Here we show that the Fcp1 protein associates with elongating RNAPII holoenzyme in vitro. Our data suggest that the association of Fcp1 with elongating polymerase results in CTD de-phosphorylation when the native ternary RNAPII0-DNA-RNA complex is disrupted. Surprisingly, highly purified yeast Fcp1 dephosphorylates serine 5 but not serine 2 of the RNAPII CTD repeat. Only free RNAPII0(Ser-5) and not RNAPII0-DNA-RNA ternary complexes act as a good substrate in the Fcp1 CTD de-phosphorylation reaction. In contrast, TFIIH CTD kinase has a pronounced preference for RNAPII incorporated into a ternary complex. Interestingly, the Fcp1 reaction mechanism appears to entail phosphoryl transfer from RNAPII0 directly to Fcp1. Elongator fails to affect the phosphatase activity of Fcp1 in vitro, but genetic evidence points to a functional overlap between Elongator and Fcp1 in vivo. Genetic interactions between Elongator and a number of other transcription factors are also reported.

During the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; CTD, C-terminal domain.1The abbreviations used are: RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; CTD, C-terminal domain. transcription cycle, both the phosphorylation state of the polymerase and the proteins that RNAPII interacts with change dramatically. Throughout promoter recruitment and initiation where RNAPII exists in a hypo-phosphorylated state, it interacts with general transcription factors, such as TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, TFIIH, and Mediator (1Kornberg R.D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the process of promoter clearance and early transcript elongation where RNAPII becomes hyper-phosphorylated, interactions with initiation-specific factors are severed, and interactions with other proteins are established. Factors that have been shown to preferentially associate with hyper-phosphorylated elongating RNAPII include RNA processing factors (2Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J.

The CTD consists of the conserved heptapeptide, Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser, repeated 26 times in yeast and up to 52 times in metazoans (9Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). After transcript initiation, the CTD is heavily phosphorylated on serine 2 and serine 5 by different protein kinases (pTEFb (yeast Bur1 or Ctdk1)) and TFIIH), respectively (10Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 11Kobor M.S. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Later, during transcript elongation and at transcriptional termination, CTD phosphatases remove the phosphate groups, enabling recycling of RNAPII for a new round of transcription (11Kobor M.S.

A CTD phosphatase was first identified biochemically through its ability to specifically dephosphorylate the RNAPII CTD in vitro (13Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Indeed, the protein, now called Fcp1, directly de-phosphorylates RNAPII in vitro (13Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Fcp1 also has the ability to stimulate RNAPII transcript elongation in vitro independent of its phosphatase activity (19Mandal S.S. Cho H. Kim S. Cabane K. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7543-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that it associates with and modulates elongating RNAPII. In agreement with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that Fcp1 associates with the promoter and coding region of active genes in vivo (17Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).We have proposed previously that CTD phosphorylation during promoter clearance might displace Mediator and concomitantly allow the association of elongation-specific proteins, such as the Elongator complex (5Otero G.

The proteins of the Elongator complex are highly conserved from yeast to man, and the human complex associates with early elongation complexes in HeLa nuclear extracts (21Hawkes N.A. Otero G.

Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Yeast strains lacking the genes encoding Elongator are temperature-sensitive and slow at adapting to new growth conditions. These phenotypes can be explained by slow activation of genes required for growth under the new conditions (5Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, the majority of yeast Elongator seems to be cytoplasmic, and the factor fails to co-immunoprecipitate DNA (chromatin immunoprecipitation) from active yeast genes (23Pokholok D.K. Hannett N.M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 799-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, recent results have shown that Elongator associates with the nascent mRNA of several yeast genes in vivo (24Gilbert C. Kristjuhan A. Winkler G.S. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell,. 2004; 14: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in human cells showed that Elongator arrives at the S2 gene after assembly of the preinitiation complex and phosphorylation of the RNAPII CTD (25Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Together, these results support the idea that Elongator is loaded onto the transcribing polymerase during promoter clearance and then travels with it through the coding region of the gene.The present studies were inspired by our difficulties in extracting hyperphosphorylated, elongating RNAPII from chromatin without losing the majority of CTD phosphorylation. Because this de-phosphorylation could not be inhibited by the addition of various phosphatase inhibitors, we investigated the possibility that Fcp1 was responsible. Here we provide evidence that Fcp1 associates with the elongating RNAPII holoenzyme. Genetic experiments indicate that another holoenzyme component, Elongator, and Fcp1 functionally interact in vivo. We also show that whereas TFIIH kinase prefers RNAPII in a ternary complex as substrate, Fcp1 prefers free serine 5-phosphorylated RNAPII and that Fcp1-mediated CTD de-phosphorylation appears to proceed through a phosphoryl transfer step from the CTD directly to Fcp1. These results shed new light on the mechanisms that drive the eukaryotic transcription cycle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals were from Sigma, unless otherwise specified.

The omission of the two nucleotides causes RNAPIIO to stall after transcribing 36 nucleotides.Transcription was done with 100–200 ng of RNAPII0 or RNAPIIA in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm ATP, 20 μm GTP, 5 μCi/25 μl[α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1 μl of RNase inhibitase (5′–3′), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 pmol of template oligonucleotide DNA for 30 min at room temperature in a 25-μl reaction volume. When the transcription product (ternary complex) was to be used as substrate for Fcp1 phosphatase or TFIIH kinase, no radioactively labeled GTP was used, and biotin on the transcription template here allowed the ternary complexes to be separated from free polymerase by the use of streptavidin beads. This step also ensured removal of TFIIH as well as free label from the reactions using labeled RNAPII0 as the polymerase source, whether TFIIH-mediated phosphorylation was done before or after transcription.Fcp1 Phosphatase Activity Assay—Fcp1 phosphatase activity, as well as the phosphatase activity of crude chromatin fractions, was assayed with 100–200 ng of RNAII0 (free or as ternary complex) as a substrate in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.025% Tween 20, 10 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 10 mm okadaic acid for 30 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 20–50 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer, and samples were incubated at 95 °C for 3 min before loading onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to either a PhosphorImager screen or BioMax (Eastman Kodak Co.) film with an intensifying screen.Yeast Genetics—All Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used for genetic analysis were congenic with strain W303 (ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-2,212 trp1-1 ura3-52) (33Thomas B.J.

Plasmid shuffle of fcp1 alleles carried on TRP1-marked plasmids in fcp1Δ elpΔ cells carrying wild type FCP1 on a URA3-marked plasmid was done using standard techniques (34Sherman F. Guthrie C.

After growth in URA+ media, cells that had lost the URA3 plasmid were selected on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing media.Synthetic Genetic Array Analysis—Synthetic genetic array analysis was carried out as described previously (35Tong A.H.

This observation inspired us to investigate further the biochemical characteristics of RNAPII de-phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylation level of RNAPII in crude, sheared yeast chromatin remained fairly stable after incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. In contrast, conditions that would be expected to disrupt ternary DNA-RNA-RNAPII0 complexes, such as DNase treatment and to an even larger extent DNase treatment plus addition of nucleotides (which would permit transcriptional run-off), led to significant CTD de-phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 4). These experiments support the idea that the RNAPII CTD becomes susceptible to dephosphorylation upon disruption of the ternary complex and provides a possible explanation for our difficulties in isolating hyper-phosphorylated RNAPII after chromatin extraction.In the course of investigating RNAPII de-phosphorylation in crude chromatin, we also noticed that protein phosphatase inhibitors such as sodium fluoride and okadaic acid failed to inhibit the reaction (data not shown). One of the hallmarks of Fcp1 is being unresponsive to such inhibitors (13Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so in order to investigate the contribution of this protein to the observed CTD de-phosphorylation, chromatin was prepared from an fcp1 temperature-sensitive strain (fcp1-4) and its wild type counterpart. The mutated fcp1-4 allele results in a protein that has little, if any, CTD phosphatase activity at elevated temperature in vivo (16Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C. Gileadi O. Jansma D.B. Jennings E.G. Kouyoumdjian F. Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CTD de-phosphorylation was then compared at 25, 30, and 37 °C (Fig. 1B). In chromatin from the wild type strain, significant CTD de-phosphorylation was observed at both 30 and 37 °C, but in chromatin from fcp1-4, little if any de-phosphorylation took place at any of the temperatures tested. This lack of de-phosphorylation was not due to the chromatin from this strain generally lacking biological activity, as run-off transcription activity in vitro was similar in fcp1-4 and wild type chromatin under the assay conditions used in Fig. 1B (data not shown). These results suggest that Fcp1 is at least partly responsible for the observed de-phosphorylation of RNAPII0 in vitro.Association of Fcp1 in a Large Protein Complex—When sheared yeast chromatin is subjected to gel filtration in high salt conditions, hyper-phosphorylated RNAPII co-fractionates with DNA, RNA, and Elongator (5Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). When the same fractions were blotted with antibodies specific for Fcp1 phosphatase, this protein was found to be broadly distributed, coeluting with hyper-phosphorylated RNAPII as well as with hypo-phosphorylated RNAPII (Fig. 2). No Fcp1 was observed in the size range otherwise expected for the protein (∼100 kDa) (data not shown). Similar to Fcp1, Elongator (Elp3) also eluted with elongating RNAPII, peaking in fraction 28. These results are consistent with the idea that Fcp1 interacts with elongating RNAPII holoenzyme in chromatin.Fig. 2Fcp1, nucleic acids, RNAPII0, and Elongator in the crude chromatin fraction. Crude chromatin was partially digested with DNase and RNase and subjected to gel filtration through TSK G4000SW (5Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Fractions were assayed for nucleic acid content (DNA/RNA), Western-blotted, and probed for the presence of RNAPII, Elongator (Elp3), and Fcp1. Please note that the quality of Western blots with crude chromatin fractions is severely reduced because of the large amount of DNA and RNA in the fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CTD De-phosphorylation with Purified Proteins—In order to investigate CTD de-phosphorylation in a more defined system, we now purified RNAPII, TFIIH, CTDK1, and Fcp1 to near homogeneity and used these proteins to enable a study of RNAPII CTD de-phosphorylation.We first tested the substrate specificity of yeast Fcp1 in vitro by incubating the enzyme with RNAPII that had been hyper-phosphorylated by either TFIIH or CTDK1 (Fig. 3). TFIIH-mediated phosphorylation is exclusively on serine 5 of the CTD repeat (see Ref. 36Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar; data not shown), whereas CTDK1-mediated phosphorylation occurs primarily on serine 2 but also to a smaller extent on serine 5 (see Ref. 37Jones J.C. Phatnani H.P. Haystead T.A. MacDonald J.A. Alam S.M. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24957-24964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; data not shown). Most interestingly, Fcp1 only had slight activity against CTDK1-phosphorylated RNAPII (predominantly serine 2-phosphorylated), whereas it efficiently removed TFIIH-mediated (serine 5) phosphorylation (Fig. 3., compare lanes 3–5 to lanes 7–9). These results were somewhat surprising as previous chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments had supported the idea that yeast Fcp1 removes serine 2 phosphorylation but does not seem to be important for the removal of serine 5 phosphorylation in genes in vivo (17Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). On the other hand, FCP1 (and serine 5 phosphorylation) is essential for yeast viability, whereas phosphorylation of serine 2 is not, pointing to a potentially important cellular role of Fcp1 besides de-phosphorylation of serine 2. As a consequence of the results of Fig. 3, we used TFIIH-phosphorylated RNAPII to investigate the substrate preference and mechanism of action of Fcp1 in the subsequent experiments.Fig. 3Fcp1 preferentially de-phosphorylates the CTD at serine 5 in vitro. 500 ng of RNAPII, phosphorylated either by CTDK1 (lanes 2–5) or TFIIH (lanes 6–9), was incubated with increasing amounts of Fcp1 (100, 200, or 400 ng), as indicated. Unphosphorylated RNAPII is shown in lane 1. The resulting samples were fractionated by 6% SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. The migration of hyper-phosphorylated (RNAPII0) and hypo-phosphorylated (RNAPIIA) Rpb1 is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To generate substrates for the de-phosphorylation reactions, biotinylated, single-strand tailed DNA templates whose transcribed region starts with a U/C-less cassette (Fig. 4A) were used in transcription reactions with RNAPIIA purified to virtual homogeneity or with RNAPII that had first hyper-phosphorylated by TFIIH in the presence of radioactively labeled ATP. Under the conditions used, a significant proportion of the input DNA template was utilized for transcription, and RNAPII shifted the migration of the DNA probe in a nucleotide-dependent manner (proof-of-principle reactions using labeled DNA template in “cold” transcription reactions are shown in Fig. 4B). Ternary complexes could be efficiently separated from free label, TFIIH, as well as nontranscribing RNAPII by the use of streptavidin beads (reactions in which TFIIH-phosphorylated (radiolabeled) RNAPII was used in cold transcription reactions on an unlabeled DNA template is shown in Fig. 4C). By the use of these procedures (see “Experimental Procedures” for more details), it was thus possible to generate different substrates for comparing the substrate specificities of Fcp1, namely (i) hyper-phosphorylated, nontranscribing RNAPII (free RNAPII0), and (ii) hyper-phosphorylated RNAPII in a"
https://openalex.org/W2017723694,"Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK) 2 in Arabidopsis has been identified as a phytochrome-interacting protein by using the C-terminal domain of phytochrome A (PhyA) as the bait in yeast two-hybrid screening. The far-red light-absorbing form of phytochrome (Pfr) A stimulates NDPK2 γ-phosphate exchange activity in vitro. To better understand the multiple functions of NDPK and its role in phytochrome-mediated signaling, we characterized the interaction between phytochrome and NDPK2. Domain studies revealed that PER-ARNT-SIM domain A in the C-terminal domain of phytochrome is the binding site for NDPK2. Additionally, phytochrome recognizes both the NDPK2 C-terminal fragment and the NDPK2 hexameric structure to fulfill its binding. To illustrate the mechanism of how the Pfr form of phytochrome stimulates NDPK2, His-197-surrounding residue mutants were made and tested. Results suggested that the H-bonding with His-197 inside the nucleotide-binding pocket is critical for NDPK2 functioning. The pH dependence profiles of NDPK2 indicated that mutants with different activities from the wild type have different pKa values of His-197 and that NDPK2 hyperactive mutants possess lower pKa values. Because a lower pKa value of His-197 accelerates NDPK2 autophosphorylation and the phospho-transfer between the phosphorylated NDPK2 and its kinase substrate, we concluded that the Pfr form of phytochrome stimulates NDPK2 by lowering the pKa value of His-197.

Enzyme (Basel). 1973; 8: 307-334Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Since its first detection in 1953 (2Berg P. Joklik W.K. Nature. 1953; 172: 1008-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Krebs H.A. Hems R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1953; 12: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), NDPK has been considered as a housekeeping enzyme used to maintain nucleoside triphosphate levels in organisms, but growing evidence has indicated that NDPK also participates in the regulation of growth, development, and signal transduction processes. In Drosophila, mutation of Awd (a NDPK homologue) results in abnormal cell morphology (4Biggs J. Hersperger E. Steeg P.S. Liotta L.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 933-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In human, Nm23-H1, a human NDPK, functions as a tumor metastasis suppressor (5de la Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additionally, Nm23-H2, an isoform of Nm23-H1, acts as a transcription factor that binds to the c-myc oncogene promoter and stimulates transcription (7Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The ability of NDPK to supply GTP also implies a role in G-protein-mediated signaling. Recent reports (8Zhu J.

Therefore, the idea that NDPK is a multifunctional enzyme is well accepted. In plants, however, little is known about the roles of NDPK (11Hasunuma K. Yabe N. Yoshida Y. Ogura Y. Hamada T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). NDPK has been characterized in rice (12Yano A. Shimazaki T. Kato A. Umeda M. Uchimiya H. Plant Mol.

Among them, spinach NDPK1 is localized in the cytosol, whereas spinach NDPK2 and NDPK3 are localized in the chloroplasts (17Zhang J. Fukui T. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Evidence suggested that plant NDPK plays an important role in signal transduction. Red light-dependent phosphorylation of NDPK in both rice and pea has been reported (18Hamada T. Hasunuma K. Komatsu S. Biol. & Pharm. Bull. 1999; 22: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Ogura T. Tanaka N. Yabe N. Komatsu S. Hasunuma K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 69: 397-403Crossref Google Scholar) and has suggested the possible involvement of NDPK in phytochrome-mediated signaling. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis, NDPK2 was reported as the only NDPK among the three isoforms to interact with phytochrome in yeast two-hybrid screening (20Choi G. Yi H. Lee J. Kwon Y.K. Soh M.S. Shin B. Luka Z. Hahn T.-R. Song P.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins of NDPK2 with green fluorescent protein are localized mainly in the nucleus and cytoplasm, sharing the same subcellular space with phytochromes. In addition, a tDNA insertion mutant of NDPK2 showed a partial defect in response to both red and far-red light, indicating NDPK2 is a positive signaling component of phytochrome-mediated signaling. NDPK2 has also been reported to be involved in UV response (21Zimmermann S. Baumann A. Jaekel K. Marbach I. Engelberg D. Frohnmeyer H. J. Biol.

Despite scanty reports in the literature and unlike NDPKs in mammals, little is known about the functional roles of plant NDPKs. They remain to be elucidated. Phytochromes are major photoreceptors that regulate a variety of photomorphogenic processes in plants (23Quail P.H. Boylan M.T. Parks B.M. Short T.W. Xu Y. Wagner D. Science. 1995; 268: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The reversible phototransformation between the red light-absorbing Pr form and the far-red light-absorbing Pfr form is the most striking characteristic of phytochrome signaling, in which the Pfr form is considered as the active form (24Khurana J.P.

Although the mechanism of phytochrome signaling is still unclear, continuous progress has been made in elucidating phytochrome kinase activity (26Yeh K.C. Wu S.H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C.

Although Arabidopsis NDPK2 has been identified as a positive signal transducer in the phytochrome signaling and its enzymatic activity is stimulated by physical binding with phytochromes, the biochemical mechanisms remain to be elucidated. To gain further insights into the mechanism of both phytochrome-mediated signaling and NDPK functioning, we characterized the interaction between phytochrome and NDPK2 in detail. In doing so, we have shown in vitro binding between phytochrome and NDPK2, and we located the specific binding region in both proteins and demonstrated the importance of NDPK2 oligomeric states in the interaction with phytochrome. We also characterized His-197-surrounding residue mutants to investigate the mechanism of how phytochrome stimulates NDPK2 activity, because the H-bonding with the active histidine residue is essential for NDPK functioning (35Schneider B. Babolat M. Xu Y.W. Janin J. Ve ́ron M. Deville-Bonne D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Tepper A.D. Dammann H. Bominarr A.A. Ve ́ron M. J. Biol.

The pH dependence profiles of NDPK2 wild type and mutants revealed the relationship between NDPK2 activity and the pKa value of His-197. The similarities between the hyperactive NDPK2 mutants and the Pfr form of phytochrome-stimulated NDPK2 suggested that the stimulation of NDPK2 activity by phytochrome is because of the direct modulation of the H-bonding with His-197, following the phytochrome binding to the NDPK2 C-terminal fragment.

The C-terminal deletion mutants of NDPK2 for the phytochrome binding study were prepared as follows (STOP codon is underlined): R230Stop (80–229 aa) with 3′-primer, 5′-GAGACCCGGGCTATAGCCATGTAGCTAGAGCCG-3′ (SmaI); L225Stop (80–224 aa) with 3′-primer, 5′-GAGACCCGGGCTAAGCCGAATCCCACTTGCATAGC-3′ (SmaI); K214Stop (80–213 aa) with 3′-primer, 5′-GAGACCCGGGCTAGAACCACAGACCAATCTCACG-3′ (SmaI); N204Stop (80–203 aa) with 3′-primer, 5′-GAGACCCGGGCTATTCAGGGCTGTCACTACCATG-3′ (SmaI); and S199Stop (80–198 aa) with 3′-primer, 5′-GAGACCCGGGCTAACCATGCACAATGTTCCTTCC-3′ (SmaI). Native oat PhyA was purified as previously reported (37Lapko V.N. Song P.-S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the in vitro binding assay with 14C-labeled NDPK2, NDPK2 proteins were prepared by using the same method as that of unlabeled NDPK2 protein purification, with addition of 100 μCi of l-[methyl-14C]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) into 250 ml of Escherichia coli culture. The specific radioactivity of the final 14C-labeled NDPK2 was around 600 cpm/μm. The radioactivity of the bound NDPK2 after immunoprecipitation with phytochromes was measured by using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The in vitro mutagenesis of NDPK2 was performed using QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis protocol (S-tratagene). The synthetic primers (sense) designed to produce the desired point mutations are listed as follows: Y87D, 5′-GTTGAGGAGACTGACATTATGGTGAAACC-3′; M89D, 5′-GGAGACTTACATTGACGTGAAACCTGATGG-3′; H130E, 5′-GAATTGGCTGAGGAGGAATATAAGGAGCTTAG-3′; H130Q, 5′-GAATTGGCTGAGGAGCAATATAAGGAGCTTAG-3′; P175S, 5′-TAGGGAAAACAGATTCGCTTCAAGCTGAACC-3′; H197C, 5′-GAAGGAACATGTGTGTGGTAGTGACAGC-3′; G198D, 5′-GAACATTGTGCATGATAGTGACAGCCCTG-3′; G198N, 5′-GAACATTGTGCATAATAGTGACAGCCCTG-3′; S199D, 5′-CATTGTGCATGGTGATGACAGCCCTGAAAAC-3′; S199N, 5′-CATTGTGCATGGTAATGACAGCCCTGAAAAC-3′; S199T, 5′-CATTGTGCATGGTACTGACAGCCCTGAAAAC-3′; N204D, 5′-GACAGCCCTGAAGACGGCAAGCGTGAG-3′; E208D, 5′-GAAAACGGCAAGCGTGACATTGGTCTGTGG-3′; W212D, 5′-GTG-AGATTGGTCTGGACTTCAAAGAGGGC-3′; and W212K, 5′-GTGAGATTGGTCTGAAGTTCAAAGAGGGC-3′. NDPK2 dimeric form mutants, including RP175S, LP175S, and KP175S, were prepared using the corresponding deletion mutants (R230Stop, L225Stop, and K214Stop) and the primers designed for P175S site-directed mutagenesis. All primers were PAGE-purified. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of Phytochromobilin Chromophore and Its Assembly with Recombinant Phytochromes—Phytochromobilin was purified by chromatography as described previously (38Beale S.I. Cornejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22333-22340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Holophytochromes were prepared by adding phytochromobilin to phytochrome apoproteins at a final concentration of 20 μm, followed by a 1-h incubation on ice. In Vitro Binding Assay—The in vitro binding assays of phytochrome and NDPK2 were performed by incubating 10 μg of phytochrome and 20 μg of NDPK2 in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl), containing 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dCDP, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors, at 4 °C for 30 min. Either antibody Oat-22 against oat PhyA or the specific antibody against NDPK2 was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 40 min. The antibody-protein complexes were recovered by incubation with 0.1 volumes of protein-A/G beads (Oncogene) for an additional 30 min and then collected by centrifugation. Beads were washed five times in TBS buffer. The attached proteins were solubilized in 1× SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min and then resolved on 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting analysis. Size Exclusion Chromatography—NDPK2 (5 μg) was applied to a Biosilect® SEC 250–5 column (Bio-Rad) in a Shimadzu LC-10AT high pressure liquid chromatography system and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), with 150 mm NaCl and 6 mm dithiothreitol. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. NDPK2 γ-Phosphate Exchange Activity Assay—NDPK2 γ-phosphate exchange activity was measured as described previously (20Choi G. Yi H. Lee J. Kwon Y.K. Soh M.S. Shin B. Luka Z. Hahn T.-R. Song P.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assay buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 mm ATP, 0.3 mm NADH, 5 units of pyruvate kinase, 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 mm dCDP. The reaction was initiated by adding 3 nm NDPK2. NDPK2 activity was measured by monitoring the lactate dehydrogenase-pyruvate kinase-coupled NADH decrease at 340 nm. The phytochrome effect was examined by incubating a mixture of native oat PhyA and NDPK2 under illumination of red light (660 nm, Pfr form) or far-red light (730 nm, Pr form) for 8 min and measuring the NDPK2 activity. The Km values of NDPK2 with different nucleotides were measured in a similar manner with a fixed concentration of 60 nm of Pfr phytochrome. NDPK2 Autophosphorylation and Kinase Activity—NDPK2 autophosphorylation was performed in a buffer containing 5 μg of NDPK2 protein, 50 mm triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm ATP or GTP, 5 μCi of γ-32P-labeled ATP or GTP for 15 min on ice. NDPK2 kinase activity was measured by using 0.2 μg of NDPK2 protein and 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) protein in the same reaction buffer as autophosphorylation for 10 min at 30 °C. The phytochrome effect was examined by adding the indicated amount of oat PhyA to the reaction mixture under either autophosphorylation conditions or kinase activity conditions. NDPK2 Activity Measurements; pH Dependence and Thermal Stability—The pH dependence of NDPK2 was measured as described previously (35Schneider B. Babolat M. Xu Y.W. Janin J. Ve ́ron M. Deville-Bonne D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). AMT isoionic buffer (50 mm acetic acid, 50 mm Mes, and 100 mm Tris-HCl) (39Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) was used at a pH range of 5.0–9.5. The thermal stabilities of NDPK2 wild type and mutant proteins were analyzed by measuring NDPK2 activity after 10 min of incubation at the indicated temperatures. NDPK2 Binding with [3H]GDP; Equilibrium Dialysis Experiment— The binding of [3H]GDP (Amersham Biosciences) by NDPK2 was measured via equilibrium dialysis as described previously with minor modification (40Seravalli J. Shoemaker R.K. Sudbeck M.J. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5736-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A 12–14-kDa cut-off dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por) was used to separate the buffer containing NDPK2 (bottom) and the buffer containing [3H]GDP (top). The bottom portion containing NDPK2 was monitored at the indicated time points with a liquid scintillation counter. The phytochrome effect was examined by adding native oat PhyA to the NDPK2 portion and illuminating the reaction mixture every 8 h during the incubation in the dark. NDPK2 Interacts with Phytochrome in Vitro—We have reported previously (20Choi G. Yi H. Lee J. Kwon Y.K. Soh M.S. Shin B. Luka Z. Hahn T.-R. Song P.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) that NDPK2 interacts with the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis PhyA in yeast two-hybrid screening and can be catalytically stimulated by the Pfr form of native oat PhyA. To better understand the interaction between NDPK2 and phytochrome, an in vitro binding experiment was conducted. Purified native oat PhyA was tested in the immunoprecipitation reaction with NDPK2. Results indicated that NDPK2 possessed a weak interaction with both Pr and Pfr forms of phytochrome in the absence of dCDP (Fig. 1A). However, NDPK2 was found to interact with the Pfr form of phytochrome preferentially in the presence of dCDP (Fig. 1A). This Pfr-specific interaction between phytochrome and NDPK2 with nucleotide addition is consistent with the current concept that the Pfr form of phytochrome is the active form in phytochrome-mediated signaling. Therefore, dCDP was applied in the future binding experiments between these two proteins. Recombinant phytochromes were also tested, including recombinant oat PhyA, Arabidopsis PhyA, and Arabidopsis PhyB. Results showed a Pfr preference in the binding as well (Fig. 1B). To investigate the binding kinetics between phytochrome and NDPK2, NDPK2 protein incorporated with 14C-labeled methionine was expressed and tested in a binding assay with native oat PhyA. Results confirmed the Pfr-preferred interaction between phytochrome and NDPK2 in the presence of dCDP and suggested that the interaction between these two proteins in the absence of dCDP is nonspecific (Fig. 1C). In addition, results also indicated that the saturation binding of NDPK2 occurred at ∼330 nm when 105 nm phytochrome was tested. Thus, the binding ratio between phytochrome and NDPK2 is close to the ratio of phytochrome dimer (41Sharrock R.A. Clack T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11500-11505Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to NDPK2 hexamer (42Im Y.J. Kim J.-I. Shen Y. Na Y. Han Y.-J. Kim S.-H. Song P.-S. Eom S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To locate the NDPK2-binding site in the phytochrome molecule, partial-length phytochromes were expressed and tested. To be consistent with previous experiments, oat PhyA was selected as the phytochrome for the domain study. The N-terminal domain of oat PhyA (AN, 1–505 aa) showed no binding with NDPK2 when testing both Pr and Pfr forms, whereas the C-terminal domain (oat AC, 506–1129 aa) was sufficient to bind NDPK2 (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, the C-terminal domains of both Arabidopsis PhyA and PhyB also interacted with NDPK2 in the in vitro binding assay (Fig. 2A). The γ-phosphate exchange activity assay confirmed that the phytochrome C-terminal domain alone is sufficient to bind and stimulate NDPK2 (Fig. 2B). To determine the exact binding site of NDPK2 in the C-terminal domain, oat PhyA C-terminal deletion mutants, A957 and A686, were tested. A957 (1–957 aa) is composed of PAS domain A, the Quail box (Q box), and PAS domain B, with the histidine kinase-related domain (HKRD) removed, whereas A686 (1–686 aa) contains PAS domain A only (Fig. 2C). The zinc-blotting analysis confirmed the appropriate assembly between phytochrome apoproteins and chromophore phytochromobilin (Fig. 2D). Both A957 and A686 interacted with NDPK2, with A957 binding Pfr preferentially and A686 binding Pr and Pfr equally (Fig. 2D). Further experiments revealed that A686 undergoes a quick dark reversion from its Pfr to Pr forms (Fig. 2E). The structural difference between Pr and Pfr A686 could be compromised by this quick dark reversion, especially during a time range of 90 min in the immunoprecipitation reaction. Meanwhile, both A957 and A686 were able to stimulate NDPK2 γ-phosphate exchange activity (Fig. 2F). Because NDPK2 activity was measured within 10 min immediately after red light illumination, the quick dark reversion of A686 is not obvious in this enzymatic assay. Results indicated that Pfr A686 stimulated NDPK2 more than Pr A686. Because the N-terminal domain of oat PhyA (AN, 1–505 aa) did not bind to NDPK2 and PAS domain A is the only subdomain left in A686, PAS domain A is identified as the NDPK2-binding site. Phytochrome Recognizes Both NDPK2 Hexameric Structure and Its C-terminal Fragment—To locate the phytochrome-binding site in NDPK2, NDPK2 mutants, including the C-terminal deletion mutants, kinase site mutant H197C, and Kpn loop mutant P175S, were made and tested in the binding assays with the Pfr form of native oat PhyA (Fig. 3A). Results indicated that mutants H197C and P175S interacted with Pfr phytochrome as well as the wild type, suggesting that the kinase activity and Kpn loop of NDPK2 are not involved in the binding with phytochrome directly. Furthermore, the C-terminal deletion mutants R230Stop and L225Stop interacted with Pfr phytochrome well, whereas mutant K214Stop showed almost no interaction with Pfr phytochrome. Moreover, no interactions between Pfr phytochrome and mutants N204Stop and S199Stop were observed. These results indicated that the NDPK2 C-terminal fragment, especially residues 214–224, is critical in the interaction with phytochrome. Results from the γ-phosphate exchange activity assay were consistent with the in vitro binding assay. Mutants R230Stop and L225Stop were stimulated by Pfr phytochrome significantly, whereas mutants K214Stop, N204Stop, and S199Stop were not stimulated under the identical conditions (Fig. 3B), suggesting the C-terminal fragment of NDPK2 as the phytochrome-binding site. To investigate the role of NDPK2 oligomeric states in the interaction with phytochrome, the dimeric forms of NDPK2 mutants were made according to the method described previously (43Karlsson A. Mesnildrey S. Xu Y. More ́ra S. Janin J. Ve ́ron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19928-19934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), including mutants R230StopP175S (RP175S), L225StopP175S (LP175S), and K214StopP175S (KP175S). Among them, mutants LP175S and KP175S were confirmed by size exclusion chromatography as the dimeric form of NDPK2, whereas the hexameric form was dominant in mutant RP175S (Table I). The in vitro binding assay showed that there is no interaction between Pfr phytochrome and the dimeric form of NDPK2 (Fig. 4A). The γ-phosphate exchange activity assay indicated a dramatic decrease in the activities of these NDPK2 mutants even though their corresponding deletion mutants showed relatively higher activities than the wild type (Fig. 4B). NDPK2 wild type and Kpn loop mutant P175S served as controls in this experiment. Although mutant P175S interacted well with Pfr phytochrome in the binding assay, its activity was affected due to the damage of the subunit interactions caused by the Kpn loop mutation. Meanwhile, the dimeric form of NDPK2 also lost the ability to be stimulated by the Pfr phytochrome (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrated the importance of NDPK2 oligomeric states in the interaction between phytochrome and NDPK2.Table IOligomeric states of NDPK2 and NDPK2 dimeric form mutantsOligomeric statesHexamerDimer%NK2 wild type1000L225Stop∼95∼5P175S∼71∼29RP175S∼64∼36LP175S∼25∼75KP175S∼11∼89 Open table in a new tab Phytochrome Increases the Nucleotide Affinity of NDPK2 by Accelerating the Nucleotide Exchange during γ-Phosphate Exchange Reaction—To investigate the mechanism of phytochrome stimulation on NDPK2, the nucleotide affinity was the first issue addressed. By using two natural nucleotide substrates of NDPK2, ATP and GDP, the Km values were measured (Table II). Addition of Pfr phytochrome lowers the ATP Km value of NDPK2 from 0.286 to 0.183 mm and the GDP Km value from 0.231 to 0.189 mm, respectively. To examine the relationship between the nucleotide affinity and NDPK activity, NDPK2 hyperactive mutants, including R230Stop and L225Stop, were also examined. Both mutants showed decreased Km values as follows: 0.211 and 0.213 mm for ATP, and 0.203 and 0.191 mm for GDP. Therefore, it appears that a higher nucleotide affinity corresponds to a higher NDPK activity and that the Pfr phytochrome stimulates NDPK2 by increasing its nucleotide affinity.Table IIThe Km values of NDPK2, Pfr phytochrome-stimulated NDPK2, and NDPK2 C-terminal deletion mutants determined by using ATP and GDPKmATP (dCDP as acceptor)GDP (ATP as donor)NDPK20.286 mm0.231 mmNDPK2 + Pfr0.183 mm0.189 mmPhyA (145 nm)R230Stop0.211 mm0.203 mmL225Stop0.213 mm0.191 mm Open table in a new tab There are two likely possibilities that could lead to a nucleotide affinity increase in the measurement of t"

Using purified recombinant IRK fragments and the isolated intact insulin receptor, we show here that autophosphorylation is inhibited by ADP and that this effect is essentially reversed by hydrogen peroxide. Autophosphorylation was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide (60 μm) in the absence of ADP but enhanced in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of ADP (67 μm). Enhancement by hydrogen peroxide required direct interaction of hydrogen peroxide with the kinase domain and was not seen in insulin receptor mutants C1245A and C1308A. A similar enhancement was obtained in intact cells in the absence of insulin upon treatment with 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-nitrosourea, indicating that IRK activity can be alternatively enhanced by a shift in the thiol/disulfide redox status. Molecular modeling of the IRK domain indicated that the ATP-binding site becomes distorted after releasing the nucleotide unless the IRK domain is oxidatively derivatized at Cys1245. Recent clinical studies suggest that these effects may play a role in obesity due to the fact that cytoplasmic creatine kinase in combination with phosphocreatine normally ensures rapid removal of ADP in muscle cells but not in fat cells.

The physiological significance of the role of hydrogen peroxide was underscored by the finding that insulin stimulates the formation of superoxide radicals and their derivative hydrogen peroxide by NAD(P)H oxidase in adipocytes (7Mahadev K.

An important role of hydrogen peroxide in insulin signaling was also suggested by the finding that mice overexpressing cellular glutathione peroxidase develop insulin resistance (18McClung J.P.

Treatment of cells with the glutathione reductase inhibitor 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), which is known to shift the intracellular thiol/disulfide redox status (23Galter D.

Using purified recombinant fragments of the IRK domain, we show here that hydrogen peroxide directly interacts with the IRK domain and enhances its autophosphorylation and kinase activity in the presence of ADP. In the absence of hydrogen peroxide, ADP was found to inhibit IRK activity in a dose-dependent way. As creatine is utilized selectively by the brain and skeletal muscle tissues and mediates the rapid removal of ADP, i.e. a product of the kinase reaction, by cytoplasmic creatine kinase (25Stöckler-Ipsiroglu S.

Beaudoin J. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8014-8018Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were cultured in nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum. Confluent cells were routinely used, as endogenous reactive oxygen species production is lower at higher cell density (29Pani G. Colavitti R. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One day before the experiment, the cells were cultured under serum-free conditions as described (30Schmid E. Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Hack V. Dröge W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The glutathione reductase inhibitor BCNU (80 μm; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Munich, Germany) and hydrogen peroxide (50 μm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were added to the cells 2 h and 30 min, respectively, before harvest. Kinase Assay of Immunoprecipitated IR Precipitations—For IR kinase assays, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and 0.4 mm EDTA and lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). The IR was immunoprecipitated with the β-chain-specific antibody Ab-1 (Oncogene Science) (24Schmid E. El Benna J. Galter D. Klein G. Dröge W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in kinase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm glutathione, 1 mm cysteine, and 5 mm Mg2+ plus 5 mm AMP-PNP and/or 0.2 mm ATP; preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C; and finally incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 25 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 15 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was stopped by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE (7% gels) in glycine/Tris buffer (pH 8.3), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and finally subjected to autoradiography. Subsequently, tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc., Hamburg, Germany). IR expression was determined with anti-β-IR polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) as described (24Schmid E. El Benna J. Galter D. Klein G. Dröge W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections—CHO cells were transiently transfected with pECE vectors containing the human wild-type IR or its mutants C1056A, C1234A, C1245A, and C1308A (kindly provided by Dr. C. W. Ward, CSIRO Health Sciences and Nutrition, Parkville, Australia). Transfections were performed with 1.5 μg of DNA using the Polyfect reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 30 h, cells were incubated for 17 h in serum-free nutrient mixture F-12 and finally incubated with or without 60 μm hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Cells were lysed, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were processed as described above. Purified Recombinant IRK Preparations—The IRK-D fragment containing Val978–Lys1283 of the human IR with mutations C981S and Y984F (35 kDa) was prepared by constructing a baculovirus transfer vector (pVL1393). The sequence was verified by automated sequencing. Cotransfection of Sf9 cells and isolation of recombinant baculoviruses were performed as described (4Baer K. Al-Hasani H. Parvaresch S. Corona T. Rufer A. Nölle V. Bergschneider E. Klein H.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14268-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl(pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete™ by sonication, and the recombinant protein was purified by sequential chromatography on Q (6-ml column; Amersham Biosciences), Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences), and Mono Q (1-ml column; Amersham Biosciences) and finally shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -74 °C. In addition, the entire cytosolic domain of IRK was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (GST-IRK, 71 kDa) in insect cells and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography as described previously (4Baer K. Al-Hasani H. Parvaresch S. Corona T. Rufer A. Nölle V. Bergschneider E. Klein H.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14268-14278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Aliquots containing 0.4 μg of GST-IRK or IRK-D were typically mixed with kinase buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP), 1 mm cysteine, and 1 mm glutathione with or without 60 μm hydrogen peroxide (final concentrations). Unless indicated otherwise, the samples were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, mixed with ATP substrate solution (0.4 mm ATP and 0.1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP) in a final volume of 15 μl/sample; and subjected to kinase assay at 30 °C with shaking. Native Gel Kinase Assay—Aliquots of 0.75 μg of IRK-D were mixed with 1 μg of MBP in 6 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 200 mm NaCl. After adding 1 μl of 0.42 mm hydrogen peroxide (final concentration of 60 μm), the sample was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then mixed with 1 μl of 20 mm ATP (final concentration of 2.5 mm). Aliquots of 4 μl were incubated for another 5 or 30 min, subsequently mixed with 1.25 μl of stop buffer (20 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 40% glycerol), immediately frozen, and eventually applied to an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.375 m Tris (pH 8.8). Finally, the samples were run for 60 min at 145 V in Tris/glycine buffer (pH 8.5) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry blotting apparatus. The membranes were incubated overnight with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and treated with a chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Subsequently, the membranes were washed with hot water and incubated with antibodies against phosphorylated Tyr1158 of IRK (BIOSOURCE, Nivelles, Belgium). After incubation with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG, the resulting bands were detected using a chemiluminescent alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad, Munich). Three-dimensional Modeling of the Phosphorylated IR β-Chain and of Derivatized Proteins—The three-dimensional structures of the IRK-3P domain and its derivatives were modeled on an Indigo II work-station (Silicon Graphics). The starting coordinates of non-hydrogen atoms were taken from Protein Data Bank entry 1ir3 (3Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Selected atoms were removed; atoms not reported in the Protein Data Bank were inserted with the help of the INSIGHT II library; and hydrogen atoms were added. Energy minimization was performed using the DISCOVER module of the INSIGHT II program (Accelrys Inc.) as described (31Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Dröge W. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The figures of the minimized structures were obtained by RasMol. Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide on Purified Recombinant Fragments of the IRK Domain—To determine whether hydrogen peroxide may directly act upon the IR, we used purified recombinant β-chain fragments. Two constructs were prepared, a GST-tagged fragment comprising the entire cytosolic domain of the β-chain (GST-IRK, 71 kDa) and a non-tagged fragment comprising the kinase domain from Val978 to Lys1283 (IRK-D, 35 kDa). The purified proteins were first incubated with or without 60 μm hydrogen peroxide and with 1 mm ATP and then subjected to kinase assay with [32P]ATP. The results show that hydrogen peroxide treatment enhanced the incorporation of 32P (Fig. 1A). To further characterize the effect, we separated the different phosphorylated forms of IRK-D on native polyacrylamide gels on the basis of charge (32Cann A.D. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11289-11300Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and detected by phospho-specific antibodies. All three phosphorylated forms of IRK-D were found to be markedly enhanced by hydrogen peroxide if tested after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1B). The non-phosphorylated state (IRK-0P) reacted only weakly with both antibodies but accounted for 90% of the IRK-D fragment (data not shown). Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide in Combination with ADP—If GST-IRK was incubated with hydrogen peroxide in the absence of ATP and then subjected to kinase assay with 0.4 mm ATP plus [32P]ATP for different periods of time, hydrogen peroxide was found to enhance IRK activity only after 16–32 min (data not shown). To determine whether this relatively late effect was mechanistically related to the endogenous production of ADP, we added graded concentrations of ADP at the start of the kinase reaction and determined the phosphorylation at an early time point (12 min). The results show that hydrogen peroxide indeed caused a significant increase in MBP substrate phosphorylation and IRK autophosphorylation at this early time point in the presence of 67 μm ADP (Fig. 2, B and E). In the absence of ADP, hydrogen peroxide had practically no effect on MBP phosphorylation and even suppressed IRK autophosphorylation (Fig. 2E). As the relative enhancement of autophosphorylation at 22.5 μm ADP was not significantly smaller than that at 7.5 μm ADP (Fig. 2E), the difference between these two points must not be over-interpreted. In the absence of hydrogen peroxide, MBP phosphorylation and IRK autophosphorylation were inhibited by ADP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and F), implying that the relative enhancement by hydrogen peroxide had essentially the effect of reversing the inhibitory effect of ADP. To determine whether hydrogen peroxide may alter the affinity for ATP, we analyzed the rate of autophosphorylation of GST-IRK during the first 6 min under conditions of graded ATP concentrations in the absence of ADP (data not shown). This analysis revealed no substantial change in Km(ATP) (221.1 versus 198.7 μm). Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide in Combination with the ATP Analog AMP-PNP—Like ADP, AMP-PNP facilitates the conversion of the gate-closed conformation into the gate-open conformation (3Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 5Maddux B.A. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6731-6736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Ablooglu A.J. Han Y-P. Kohanski R.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). But AMP-PNP is larger than ADP and, unlike ATP, is non-hydrolyzable. We therefore incubated GST-IRK with or without 60 μm hydrogen peroxide for 15 min and with 2 mm AMP-PNP for another 30 min, precipitated the enzyme subsequently with anti-GST antibody-agarose, and determined the autophosphorylation activity using [γ-32P]ATP and 0.2 mm ATP. The results show that, under these conditions, hydrogen peroxide enhanced IRK activity, on the average, by as much as 8.59-fold (p < 0.01) (data not shown). IRK Activity of Hydrogen Peroxide-treated Cells in the Absence and Presence of Insulin—To study the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the IR in intact cells, CHO-HIR cells (28Ebina Y. Edery M. Ellis L. Standring D. Beaudoin J. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8014-8018Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were incubated with or without 50 μm hydrogen peroxide for 30 min prior to harvest. The receptor was immunoprecipitated and then preincubated for 30 min with 0.2 mm unlabeled ATP with or without 5 mm AMP-PNP prior to kinase assay with 25 μm ATP plus 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. As the kinase reaction was performed with 25 μm ATP, the endogenous formation of ADP was relatively small in these experiments. If tested without preincubation, i.e. in the absence of AMP-PNP and ADP, receptor preparations from hydrogen peroxide-treated cells were not detectably different from control samples (data not shown). In contrast, after preincubation, kinase activity was strongly enhanced by hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3, A–C). The strongest enhancement was again seen after preincubation with AMP-PNP. A similar enhancing effect of hydrogen peroxide was observed in insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 3D). In view of its structural similarity to ADP, AMP-PNP was also expected to compete for the ATP-binding site and thereby to inhibit kinase activity in the absence of hydrogen peroxide. To ensure that this was indeed the case under the conditions of our experiments, we compared kinase activities with and without AMP-PNP. The results show that AMP-PNP inhibited both IRK autophosphorylation and MBP substrate phosphorylation if tested in the presence of 0.2 or 0.3 mm ATP (Fig. 4). However, if the kinase reaction was performed without the addition of unlabeled ATP, i.e. with only a minute amount of radioactively labeled ATP, IR autophosphorylation was enhanced by AMP-PNP (Fig. 4A). This indicates that, under conditions of low nucleotide concentrations, the enhancing effect of AMP-PNP prevails over its inhibitory effect, in line with the notion that the optimal conversion of the gate-closed conformation into the gate-open conformation requires relatively high nucleotide concentrations. Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide and ADP on the Immunoprecipitated Intact Insulin Receptor—If the immunoprecipitated receptor was treated with or without hydrogen peroxide and then directly subjected to kinase assay in the presence of graded concentrations of ADP for 15 min, it was again found that IRK activity was inhibited by ADP (67 μm) in the absence of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3E) and that hydrogen peroxide enhanced IRK activity in the presence of ADP but not in its absence (Fig. 3F). Alternative Mode of Redox Regulation of IRK Activity by BCNU—As several other signaling processes have been shown to be induced alternatively by hydrogen peroxide or by an oxidative shift in the thiol/disulfide redox status (reviewed in Refs. 33Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7050) Google Scholar and 34Georgiou G. Cell. 2002; 111: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we also studied the effect of the intracellular redox status on IRK activation. To induce an oxidative shift in the intracellular thiol/disulfide redox status, the cells were treated with the glutathione reductase inhibitor BCNU (see Ref. 23Galter D. Mihm S. Dröge W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The results show that BCNU treatment mediated an enhancing effect similar to that of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3, A–C). Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide on Mutant Insulin Receptor Proteins—To determine whether the enhancing effect of hydrogen peroxide may involve a cysteine residue of the IR β-chain, we performed experiments with CHO cells transiently transfected with DNA from mutant proteins. Cells were treated with or without 60 μm hydrogen peroxide for 30 min prior to harvest and analyzed as described above. As mutant C1138A was previously found to be functionally defective (30Schmid E. Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Hack V. Dröge W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this mutant was not included in this study. The results show that hydrogen peroxide enhanced the relative autophosphorylation of the wild-type receptor and mutant C1056A (Fig. 5). The enhancing effect was statistically not significant with mutant C1234A, and it was completely abrogated with mutant C1245A. Autophosphorylation of C1308A was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide. Molecular Modeling of Oxidized Forms of the IRK Domain—As crystal structures of selectively oxidized IRK proteins are not available, we used mass spectrometric analysis of hydrogen peroxide-treated IRK samples to characterize the structural modifications. However, in line with negative results of others (35Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the critical cysteine-containing peptides could not be detected in the spectrum. We therefore performed molecular modeling studies. As hydrogen peroxide treatment typically converts cysteine into sulfenic acid residues, which spontaneously interact with glutathione to form mixed proteinglutathione disulfides (reviewed in 33Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7050) Google Scholar, 34Georgiou G. Cell. 2002; 111: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and because our experiments with hydrogen peroxide were routinely performed in the presence of glutathione, we performed molecular modeling with glutathionylated IRK structures. The limited accessibility of Cys1056, Cys1234, and Cys1245 on the surface of the IRK domain practically excludes disulfide formation with another IRK domain. Three-dimensional models of the gate-open conformation of the IR β-chain were derived from Protein Data Bank entry 1ir3 (3Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Certain atoms were removed, and other atoms not reported in entry 1ir3 were inserted with the help of the INSIGHT II library. Ser981 and Phe984 were replaced with the authentic Cys981 and Tyr984, respectively, and AMP-PNP was replaced with ATP before energy minimization. The resulting structure (Fig. 6A) was the basis for all further derivatizations. The β- and γ-phosphate groups of the nucleotide are held in place by two magnesium atoms, Mg1 and Mg2 (purple) (3Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Mg1 is held in place by Asn1137 O-δ and Asp O-δ1, whereas Mg2 is coordinated with Asp1150 O-δ2 and Glu1047 O-ϵ1. The space-filling model in the right panel shows a view into the nucleotide-binding cleft. After removal of ATP and peptide, energy minimization revealed a strikingly altered structure (Fig. 6B). Among other changes, the distance between the backbone amide of Gly1005 and the nearest O-δ of Asp1150, i.e. the space available for the insertion of Mg2 and β-phosphate, was decreased from 9.22 to 5.61 Å. The distance from Asp1150 O-δ2 to Glu1047 O-ϵ1, i.e. the contact points, was markedly increased from 3.25 to 4.23 Å, and the angle between Asn1137 O-δ, Asp1150 O-δ1, and Asp1150 O-δ2 was decreased from 165° to 125°. These conspicuous changes in the binding site strongly suggest that the access of the nucleotide-magnesium complex and the formation of the correct protein-nucleotide complex are markedly impaired. However, if IRK-3P was glutathionylated at Cys1245 (Fig. 6C) or Cys1234 (Fig. 6D) prior to removal of ATP and peptide substrate, subsequent energy minimization yielded a structure in which all relevant contact points were arranged in a way similar to the original ATP-loaded structure (Fig. 6A). The distances between the nitrogen of Gly1005 and the nearest O-δ of Asp1150 were 7.11 and 7.55 Å, respectively, and the angles between Asn1137 O-δ, Asp1150 O-δ1, and Asp1150 O-δ2 were 158° and 164°, respectively. The space-filling models in the right panels show that the position of Gly1005 relative to its neighbors is very similar in panels A, C, and D but markedly different in panel B. The structures glutathionylated at Cys981 or Cys1056 (data not shown) were similar to unmodified IRK-3P without ATP (Fig. 6B). The glutathionylated structures IRK-3P C1245S-SG and IRK-3P C1234S-SG with ATP and substrate (data not shown) were essentially indistinguishable from the structure in Fig. 6A. Our experiments with the intact IR and purified GST-IRK fragment have shown that IRK activity was inhibited by ADP (67 μm) in the absence of hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of inhibitory concentrations of ADP or the related nucleotide AMP-PNP, IRK activity was enhanced by hydrogen peroxide (60 μm). This effect essentially reversed the inhibitory effect of ADP. As the enhancing effect requires direct interaction of hydrogen peroxid"

Ets1 is a transcription factor expressed early in NK cell differentiation. Because IL-2Rβ, IL-2Rγ, IL-15, and Ets1 knock-out mice similarly lack NK cells, we explored a molecular connection between IL-2R signaling and Ets1. Here we report the post-transcriptional regulation of Ets1 by IL-2R signaling in human NK cells. IL-2 and IL-15 stimulation leads to increased Ets1 protein levels with no significant change in mRNA levels. Pulse and pulse-chase experiments show that IL-2 stimulation results in both a marked increase in the nascent translation of Ets1 and an increased protein half-life. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK specifically blocks IL-2- and IL-15-induced translation, whereas p38, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and mTOR inhibitors had no effect on Ets1 levels. Fli1, an Ets family member, exhibited a different mechanism of regulation, illustrating the specificity of IL-2R β and γ subunit signaling on the regulation of Ets1 expression. Expression of a dominant negative form of MNK1, a regulator of the translation initiation factor eIF4E, blocks the expression of Ets1 as do the dominant negative forms of the common IL-2R β and γ chains. Expression of Ets1 is regulated similarly in normal peripheral human NK cells. Taken together, our findings provide a direct link between IL-2R subunit signaling and Ets1 expression and helps to explain the interdependence of the IL-2R subunits and Ets1 for NK cell development and function.

Hayakawa Y. Takeda K. Yagita H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 850-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In addition to NK cell direct cytotoxicity, they also act to stimulate other cells of the immune system by secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, chemokines, and interleukins that stimulate T cell and B cell responses (2Lauwerys B.R. Garot N. Renauld J.C. Houssiau F.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NK cells participate in antigen-specific immune responses by responding to IL-2 secreted by T cells and dendritic cells (3Fehniger T.A. Cooper M.A. Nuovo G.J. Cella M. Facchetti F. Colonna M. Caligiuri M.A. Blood. 2003; 101: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Therefore, NK cells are central to both the innate and acquired immune responses. Indeed, there is an impressive correlation between low NK cell function and susceptibility to viral and other microbial infections (4Biron C.A. Byron K.S. Sullivan J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 5Kos F.J. Engleman E.G. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 174-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus have an overall reduction in the number and function of NK cells (6Goicoa M.A. Mariani A.L. Palacios M.F. Testoni R.A. Iannitelli P.S. Diez R.A. Sen L. Estevez M.E. Arch. AIDS Res. 1992; 6: 15-26PubMed Google Scholar, 7Scott-Algara D. Vuillier F. Cayota A. Dighiero G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 90: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also, NK cell activity is inversely proportional to cancer stage (8Konjevic G. Spuzic I. Neoplasma. 1993; 40: 81-85PubMed Google Scholar), and increased survival times correlate with high levels of NK cell activity (9Garzetti G.G. Cignitti M. Marchegiani F. Ciavattini A. Tranquilli A.L. Fabris N. Romanini C. Gynecol. Obstet. Investig. 1992; 34: 49-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Alonso K. Medenica R. Am. J. Clin.

Cytokine therapies that target NK cell activation provide a potential means by which to boost immune surveillance and clear both infected cells and cancer. Currently, an active area of translational research is the administration of cytokines, such as IL-2 and/or IL-15, or transfer of NK cells activated and cultured in vitro for adoptive immunotherapy (12Yan Y. Steinherz P. Klingemann H.G. Dennig D. Childs B.H. McGuirk J. O'Reilly R.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2859-2868PubMed Google Scholar, 13DeMagalhaes-Silverman M. Donnenberg A. Lembersky B. Elder E. Lister J. Rybka W. Whiteside T. Ball E. J. Immunother. 2000; 23: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cytokines act en masse to control NK cellular responses through the activation of signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase pathways (ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase), as well as the PI3K pathway (14Colucci F. Caligiuri M.A. Di Santo J.P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways transmit external stimuli to the nucleus and activate numerous transcription factors, resulting in both the temporal and spatial changes in gene expression required for cellular proliferation, cytokine secretion, or cytotoxicity (15Gaffen S.L. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, a variety of cytokines act in concert to coordinately regulate NK cell processes. Interestingly, both IL-2 and IL-15 selectively induce survival and proliferation of NK cells and other CD56+ cells such as NKT cells but not conventional T cells or B cells (16Dunne J. Lynch S.

Both the IL-2 and IL-15 receptors (IL-2R and IL-15R) are composed of three different subunits (α, β, and γ) that are involved in differential signaling and ligand binding specificities. The IL-2Rα and IL-15Rα subunit specifically binds IL-2 or IL-15, respectively (17Giri J.G. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Friend D.J. Loomis A. Shanebeck K. DuBose R. Cosman D. Park L.S. Anderson D.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Importantly, only the β subunit participates in binding IL-2 and IL-15, whereas the γ subunit participates in binding IL-2, -4, -7, -9, and -15 (15Gaffen S.L. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition to IL-2 and IL-15, NK cells respond to other cytokines such as IL-18 and IL-12 that do not share receptor subunits with IL-2 or IL-15 (14Colucci F. Caligiuri M.A. Di Santo J.P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The common signaling components and functions of IL-2 and IL-15 in NK cells suggest common regulation of a shared set of downstream target genes. The founding member of the Ets family of transcription factors, Ets1, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of NK cell function (18Barton K. Muthusamy N. Fischer C. Ting C.N. Walunas T.L. Lanier L.L. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The earliest NK cell precursor in bone marrow is characterized by Ets1 transcript expression (19Rosmaraki E.E. Douagi I. Roth C. Colucci F. Cumano A. Di Santo J.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1900-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Ets1-deficient mice have severe defects in the NK cell lineage showing marked reductions in NK cell number and NK cell cytolytic activity, have reduced interferon γ secretion, and develop tumors upon challenge with NK cell susceptible tumor cells (18Barton K. Muthusamy N. Fischer C. Ting C.N. Walunas T.L. Lanier L.L. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition to their defects in NK cells, the thymocytes of Ets1-/- mice do not produce normal levels of IL-4 after anti-CD3 stimulation (20Walunas T.L. Wang B. Wang C.R. Leiden J.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2857-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, their peripheral T cells display a severe proliferative defect in response to multiple activation signals, resulting in spontaneous apoptosis in vitro (21Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Ets1 is an essential mediator of NK cell development and function. A NK cell phenotype strikingly similar to that described for Ets1 is displayed by the mice deficient in IL-15R/IL-2R β and γ subunits (30Lian R.H. Kumar V. Semin.

Thus, it is possible that Ets1 is directly and molecularly connected to IL-2/IL-15 receptor signaling in NK cells. Although it has previously been noted that MEK > ERK1/2 signaling regulates Ets1 transcriptional activity by allowing appropriate protein partnerships (22Shaw P.E. Saxton J. Int. J. Biochem.

Induction of Ets1 by IL-2R activation correlates with the activation of the translation initiation factor, eIF4E through `1 phosphorylation but not through a PI3K/AKT-dependent mTOR pathway. Expression of a dominant negative form of MNK1 results in a marked decrease in Ets1 expression, suggesting a signaling pathway whereby Ets1 expression is regulated by an Erk1 > MNK1 > eIF4E-dependent pathway that leads to an increased Ets1 translation initiation. We also show that both IL-2 and IL-15 similarly regulate Ets1 and that blockade of either the common β or γ chain of the IL-2R results in a decreased expression of Ets1. These results demonstrate a molecular link between IL-2R signaling and Ets1 and a possible explanation for the commonality of knock-out phenotypes. Cell Culture, Cytokines, and Inhibitors—The nontransformed immortalized human NK cell line, NK92, (35Maki G. Klingemann H.G. Martinson J.A. Tam Y.K. J. Hematother.

Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were goat anti-mouse IgM (Sigma), goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (H&L), and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) (Caltag). Western Blot Analysis—Total protein was prepared using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 40 mm NaFl, and 2 mm Na3VO4. Protein concentration was determined by BCA method (Pierce), and equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membrane, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and visualized using Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST, INC.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred to Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene), and subjected to UV cross-linking. The Ets1 probe was derived from a full-length cDNA clone and the β-actin probe from I. Maroulakou (Tufts University). Hybridizations were performed using probes generated using a random priming protocol and QuikHyb in procedures provided by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The blots were quantitated using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imaging System. Northern blotting was repeated at least three independent times for each experiment. [35S]Methionine/Cysteine Pulse and Pulse-Chase—NK92 cells were incubated in RPMI medium without methionine and cysteine (Sigma) for 15 min. [35S]Methionine/cysteine (Promix; Amersham Biosciences) was added at 100 μCi/ml of medium and incubated for the times indicated in the text. The cells were lysed using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaF, 5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Na3VO4. Equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated using antibodies described in the text, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For Pulse-Chase analysis, NK92 cells were resuspended in RPMI medium without methionine and cysteine for 15 min and incubated for 1 h with [35S]methionine/cysteine at 100 μCi/ml. The cells were washed and resuspended in complete α-minimum essential medium with excess methionine (10 mm) and cysteine (3 mm) (Sigma) and allowed to incubate for the times indicated in the text. Equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies described in the text, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and exposed to x-ray film. Band density was quantitated using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imaging System and expressed as relative units of density. Immunoprecipitation—NK92 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and equal amounts of total protein were immunoprecipitated using either antibody-bound agarose beads or antibody plus protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with agitation in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were then centrifuged at 2000 cpm, washed extensively in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blot analysis. Transfection—pEYFP-N1 was purchased from Clontech, and the dominant negative forms of IL-2R β and γ chains were kindly provided by Warren J. Leonard (National Institutes of Health). Transient transfections were performed by electroporation using a newly defined protocol, 2Grund, E. M., and Muise-Helmericks, R. C. (2005) J. Immunol. Methods, in press. which allows for the efficient transfection of this cell type. Briefly, electroporations were performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II in freshly prepared 20 mm Hepes buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm dextrose, 1.25% Me2SO, and 50 mm trehalose in the presence of 100 μg of plasmid. Flow Cytometry—Sixty hours post-electroporation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, filtered through a 40-μm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon), and resuspended in the same medium at 106 cells/ml. Sorting was performed on a fluorescence-activated Vantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences). EYFP was excited by Innova 70 laser at 488-nm excitation wavelength. EYFP fluorescence emission was measured using a 530/30-nm band pass filter. IL-2 Regulates Ets1 Post-transcriptionally in NK Cells—The results generated from knock-out animal studies have suggested a molecular link between IL-2R-mediated signaling and the Ets1 transcription factor (18Barton K.

Med. 1997; 185: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The human IL-2-dependent natural killer cell line, NK92, was used to dissect the interdependence of the IL-2R and Ets1. This cell line requires IL-2 for proliferation; removal of IL-2 causes a block in the G1 phase of the cell cycle without an increase in apoptosis (data not shown and Ref. 36Hodge D.L. Schill W.B. Wang J.M. Blanca I. Reynolds D.A. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-2 withdrawal affects Ets1 expression, NK92 cells were exposed to reduced levels of IL-2 for 48 h and then stimulated with IL-2. As shown in Fig. 1A, Ets1 protein levels drop significantly in low levels of IL-2. In contrast, Ets1 levels are induced 5-fold by 3 h after the addition of IL-2 and accumulate to 10-fold at 24 h post-IL-2 induction. Because IL-2, IL-15, and IL-18 modulate NK cell activity (37Fehniger T.A. Shah M.H. Turner M.J. VanDeusen J.B. Whitman S.P. Cooper M.A. Suzuki K. Wechser M. Goodsaid F. Caligiuri M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4511-4520PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lauwerys B.R. Renauld J.C. Houssiau F.A. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we tested their effect on Ets1 expression in IL-2-starved NK92 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A both IL-2 and IL-15 induce Ets1 protein levels, whereas IL-18 does not. These data suggest that IL-2 and IL-15 induce Ets1 protein levels via the common IL-2R β and γ subunits. To determine the mechanism by which IL-2 induces the expression of Ets1, we tested the effect of IL-2 on Ets1 mRNA levels. NK92 cells starved of IL-2 for 48 h were incubated with IL-2 for increasing amounts of time and analyzed for Ets1 mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis. Ets1 mRNA levels are not significantly induced by the addition of IL-2 after starvation (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the addition of different amounts of IL-2 after starvation does not affect Ets1 mRNA steady state levels (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that treatment of NK92 cells with IL-2 primarily regulates Ets1 expression via a post-transcriptional mechanism. IL-2 Regulates Ets1 Protein Synthesis and Stability—To determine whether IL-2 regulates Ets1 via increased translation initiation and/or protein stability, pulse and pulse-chase analyses were performed. IL-2-starved NK92 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine in the presence or absence of IL-2. As shown by the immunoprecipitations and the quantitation in Fig. 2 (A and B), there is a marked increase in the rate of Ets1 synthesis in the presence of IL-2. To determine whether IL-2 also affected the stability of Ets1 protein, pulse-chase analyses were performed. As shown by the immunoprecipitations in Fig. 2C, IL-2 causes a slight increase in the stability of Ets1; however, the most pronounced effect of IL-2 is the induction of Ets1 protein synthesis in NK cells. IL-2 Regulates Ets1 Protein Levels through Erk1/2—Several pharmacological inhibitors were used to investigate the pathway(s) by which IL-2 induces the expression of Ets1 protein. NK92 cells growing in IL-2 were treated with PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, the p38 inhibitor SB203580, or the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 had the largest effect on Ets1 steady state levels (Fig. 3A). The steady state expression of another Ets family member expressed in NK cells, Ets2, was unaffected by these pharmacological agents. To determine whether the MEK inhibitor specifically blocks Ets1 induction by IL-2, IL-2-starved cells were pretreated with PD98059 or SB203580 prior to IL-2 induction (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the most marked reduction of induced Ets1 levels was in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059. To assess the specificity of ERK inhibition on Ets1, we evaluated the affect of these inhibitors on a different Ets family member whose expression is also induced by IL-2, Fli1. The induction of Fli1 is unaffected by ERK1/2 inhibition (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, Fli1 induction is blocked almost exclusively by p38 inhibition, suggesting that IL-2 regulates Ets family member expression through different signaling pathways in NK cells. Loss of Fli1, however, does not affect NK cell function. Because the state of phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and AKT closely mirror their activities, we used phosphospecific antibodies in Western blot analyses to verify the effectiveness of these upstream inhibitors with NK92 cells. As expected, the p38 inhibitor SB203580 caused a reduction in the phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced by treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 3C). Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, was effective in reducing the phosphorylation status of AKT (Fig. 3C), a downstream effector of PI3K (41Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of the MEK > ERK1/2 pathway or the PI3K > AKT pathway resulted in a slight but reproducible increase in the phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that PD98059, SB203580, and wortmannin block their expected targets in NK92 cells. Taken together our results suggest that Ets1 protein levels are significantly regulated by the MEK > ERK1/2 pathway. Because Ets1 protein levels are not completely blocked by the MEK inhibitor, it is possible that secondary mechanisms of Ets1 regulation exist. To confirm the requirement of ERK1/2 for the IL-2-dependent increased rate of Ets1 translation, IL-2-starved cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor prior to IL-2 stimulation, and the translation rate of Ets1 was measured by pulse label analyses. As shown in Fig. 4A, inhibition of MEK by PD98059 results in a significant decrease in the rate of Ets1 synthesis. The quantitation of these data is shown in Fig. 4B. Taken together, these findings indicate that IL-2 causes an ERK1/2-dependent increase in Ets1 protein expression primarily on the level of translation initiation. Phosphorylation of MNK1 and eIF4E Is Regulated by IL-2 in NK Cells and Is Blocked by MEK Inhibition—Our results suggest that IL-2 signaling through MEK may regulate the rate of Ets1 translation. Multiple signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK have roles in the regulation of translation (42Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). MNK1/2 are serine/threonine kinases that directly phosphorylates eIF4E (45Wang X. Flynn A. Waskiewicz A.J. Webb B.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), a cap-binding protein that regulates translation initiation by recruiting mRNAs to the ribosome (46Koromilas A.E. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by MNK1 serves to activate eIF4E independent of the 4E-binding proteins that bind and inhibit eIF4E. To determine whether IL-2 leads to the increased activity of MNK1 and its downstream substrate eIF4E in NK92 cells, their phosphorylation status was tested by Western blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 5A, IL-2 starvation caused a decrease in MNK1 phosphorylation. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 and not p38 inhibitor, SB203580 blocks the generation of phospho-MNK1. Likewise, eIF4E phosphorylation is induced by IL-2 but blocked by PD98059. Therefore, induction of MNK1 and eIF4E activity correlates with IL-2-induced MEK activation in NK92 cells. Consequently, IL-2-induced MNK1 and eIF4e activity may be linked to Ets1 induction in NK cells. Our pharmacological data suggest that Ets1 translation is independent of PI3K/AKT. AKT activation signals through mTOR to increase translation initiation (42Muise-Helmericks R.C. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Malstrom S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Rosen N. J. Biol.

Because of the low amount of Lhca5 in thylakoid membranes, the isolation of a native Lhca5 pigment-protein complex has not been achieved to date. Therefore, we used in vitro reconstitution to analyze whether Lhca5 binds pigments and is actually an additional light-harvesting protein. By this approach we could demonstrate that Lhca5 binds pigments in a unique stoichiometry. Analyses of pigment requirements for light-harvesting complex formation by Lhca5 revealed that chlorophyll b is the only indispensable pigment. Fluorescence measurements showed that ligated chlorophylls and carotenoids are arranged in a way that allows directed energy transfer within the light-harvesting complex. Reconstitutions of Lhca5 together with other Lhca proteins resulted in the formation of heterodimers with Lhca1. This result demonstrates that Lhca5 is indeed a protein belonging to the light-harvesting antenna of photosystem I. The properties of Lhca5 are compared with those of previously characterized Lhca proteins, and the consequences of an additional Lhca protein for the composition of the light-harvesting antenna of photosystem I are discussed in view of the recently published photosystem I structure of the pea.

All LHCs consist of a protein backbone that coordinates pigments not covalently in a way that allows directed energy transfer to the reaction center chlorophylls (Chl). In this way, LHCs increase the quantum yield of photosynthesis. The recently published crystal structure of pea PSI showed at a resolution of 3.4 Å the presence of four pigmented Lhca proteins attached to one side of the PSI core complex (1Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The PSI structure clearly revealed the orientation of the LHCI backbone and the presence of three transmembrane and two small extrinsic helices in each Lhca protein. Additionally, the number (12 per monomer) and orientation of the coordinated Chls were visible. However, the exact assignment of the resolved LHC to Lhca1 to Lhca4 could not be achieved, leaving room for speculation about their identity. To date, the LHCs resolved in this structure were assigned to Lhca1–Lhca4 according to previously performed biochemical and mutagenic studies (2Knoetzel J. Svendsen I. Simpson D.J. Eur. J.

Genomic data, however, have shown a greater heterogeneity of LHCI. In some species, one Lhca protein is encoded by several genes. In tomato, for example, there exist isoforms of Lhca1 (cab6a and cab6b, respectively) (8Pichersky E. Hoffman N.E. Bernatzky R. Piechulla B. Tanksley S.D. Cashmore A.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Lhca4 (cab11 and cab12, respectively) (9Schwartz E. Shen D. Aebersold R. McGrath J.M. Pichersky E. Green B.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thaliana contains only one gene each for Lhca1–Lhca4. However, genes encoding a fifth and sixth Lhca-like protein (lhca5 and lhca6) have been identified (10Jansson S. Trends Plant. Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Lhca6 shows very high sequence similarity to Lhca2 and can therefore be assumed an Lhca2 isoform. The expression of Lhca5 homologues has been confirmed in various plants by expressed sequence tag data base searches (11Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Jansson S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). According to the amino acid sequences of tomato Lhca proteins, the closest relatives of Lhca5 are Lhca2 and Lhca4, which share an identity of ∼46% with Lhca5. Under normal growth conditions the Lhca5 mRNA level is <10% that of the other Lhca proteins in A. thaliana (10Jansson S. Trends Plant. Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 11Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Jansson S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This might be the reason why the Lhca5 protein could not be detected for a long time, despite detailed studies of PSI. Only recently did refined analytical methods allow the identification of Lhca5 in two higher plants (11Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Jansson S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Storf S. Stauber E.J. Hippler M. Schmid V.H.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9214-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In A. thaliana the Lhca5 apoprotein was detected in isolated thylakoids and PSI by immunoblotting (11Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Jansson S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Using tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that the gene product of lhca5 is present in PSI as well as in the LHCI-730 of the tomato (12Storf S. Stauber E.J. Hippler M. Schmid V.H.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9214-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The same approach led to the identification of a possible Lhca5 homologue in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (13Stauber E.J. Fink A. Markert C. Kruse O. Johanningmeier U. Hippler M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 978-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In Lhca5, the amino acids known to be involved in chlorophyll binding in other Lhca proteins (14.Melkozernov, A. N., Lin, S., Schmid, V. H. R., Lago-Places, E., Paulsen, H., and Blankenship, R. E. (2001) in Proceedings of the 12th International Congress on Photosynthesis, August 18 –23, Brisbane, Australia, article S31-003 (on-line and CD-ISBN 0643067116), CSIRO Publishing, Melbourne, AustraliaGoogle Scholar, 15Morosinotto T.

Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consequently, one may assume that Lhca5 binds pigments too. However, isolation of a pigment-protein complex of Lhca5 has not yet been achieved, which is most probably due to the small amount of this LHC in PSI and LHCI preparations compared with that of other Lhca proteins. Therefore, the question arises as to whether Lhca5 actually binds pigments and, thus, is a “real” LHC apoprotein. In the case that it could be identified as chlorophyll-binding protein it would be interesting to learn more about its biochemical and spectral properties, which might give hints toward its physiological significance. Because of the low amount of Lhca5 in thylakoid membranes, it has yet not been possible to address these questions by analysis of the native pigment-protein complex. Therefore, in vitro reconstitution, which proved to yield native-like LHCs from other Lhc proteins, appears to be a suitable approach (5Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R.

In this study, we aimed to clarify whether Lhca5 actually is an LHC apoprotein that binds pigments in a way that is suitable for directed energy transfer. To achieve this goal, we employed the reconstitution technique using bacterially expressed Lhca5 and thylakoid membrane pigments. The reconstituted Lhca5 was analyzed with regard to its pigment binding, fluorescence properties, and oligomerization behavior. Construction of an lhca5 Expression Plasmid—The cDNA sequence corresponding to the mature A. thaliana Lhca5 apoprotein (10Jansson S. Trends Plant. Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TGAGAGTCGACGCAGGAGGAGGCATCAACCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATTCTGCAGCTAAGATGTAGAGGTGAAGAGGG-3′ (reverse). These primers generated a SalI and PstI restriction site at the 5′-end and the 3′-end, respectively. The amplified sequence was cloned into a pDS12 expression plasmid as described (19Schmid V.H.R. Potthast S. Wiener M. Bergauer V. Paulsen H. Storf S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37307-37314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using the SalI and PstI restriction sites. This cloning resulted in a protein starting with the amino acid sequence (MRGSVD)-AGGGIN, with the vector-derived amino acids set in parentheses. Correct amplification and insertion into the expression plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing of the complete coding region. Production of Materials Required for Reconstitution—For Lhca5 expression, the expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain JM101. Overexpression was done following the protocol described for Lhca1, Lhca3, and Lhca4 (19Schmid V.H.R. Potthast S. Wiener M. Bergauer V. Paulsen H. Storf S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37307-37314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the proteins were isolated as inclusion bodies as reported previously (30Paulsen H. Schmid V.H.R. Smith A.G. Witty M. Heme, Chlorophyll and Bilins: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 235-253Google Scholar). Protein quantification was performed using the Bio-Rad dye binding assay according to the manual. Accumulation of the expressed protein was analyzed by fully denaturing SDS-PAGE followed by either immunodetection with an Lhca5 antibody (used at a dilution of 1:750) (11Ganeteg U. Klimmek F. Jansson S. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or Coomassie staining to determine the apparent molecular mass of the overexpressed protein (12Storf S. Stauber E.J. Hippler M. Schmid V.H.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9214-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Total pigment extracts and individual pigments were isolated from thylakoids as described (30Paulsen H. Schmid V.H.R. Smith A.G. Witty M. Heme, Chlorophyll and Bilins: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 235-253Google Scholar). LHC Reconstitution—Reconstitution of Lhca5 was performed using the detergent exchange method (7Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For subsequent analysis of the reconstitution mixture with partly denaturing lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE (31Schmid V.H.R. Scha ̈fer C. Planta. 1994; 192: 473-479Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), 30 μg of inclusion body protein and pigments equivalent to 40 μg of Chl a + b were used. For sucrose density gradient separation (7Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), these amounts were increased to 160 and 200 μg, respectively. To analyze the pigment composition of Lhca5, reconstitution was performed with total pigment extracts. To determine the significance of individual pigments for LHC formation, pigment mixtures lacking individual pigments were used. Individual pigments were mixed corresponding to the ratio found in native LHCI (Chl a/b = 3; Chl a/Chl b/lut/vio/β-car = 9:3:1:0.55:0.45). When one pigment species was omitted from the mixture, it was replaced by the other Chl or carotenoid species to maintain a Chl to carotenoid ratio of 6. Analysis of dimer formation was done with reconstitution mixtures containing half of the protein amount of both proteins. Pigment Analysis—Photometric Chl quantification was performed in 80% acetone using the equations of Porra et al. (32Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4696) Google Scholar). To determine the pigment composition of Lhca5, pigments equivalent to 1 μg of Chl were extracted from sucrose density gradient bands with sec-butyl alcohol (33Martinson T.A. Plumley F.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) diluted with two volumes of 80% acetone and subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography analysis as in (19Schmid V.H.R. Potthast S. Wiener M. Bergauer V. Paulsen H. Storf S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37307-37314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—77 K fluorescence emission measurements were performed with a Fluoromax3 (ISA, Jobin Yvon-Spex, Grasbrunn, Germany). Sucrose density gradient bands were adjusted to 2 μg/ml Chl, 60% glycerol, 5 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 7.8), and 0.05% β-dodecylmaltoside. The samples were excited at 410 and 470 nm, and the emission was recorded in 1-nm steps using a bandwidth of 2 nm for excitation and emission light. To gain insight into the contribution of different pigment species to fluorescence emission, excitation spectra were measured. The bandwidth was 4 nm for excitation and 2 nm for emission. Excitation spectra were recorded at fluorescence emission maxima of 684 nm (Lhca1 and Lhca5 monomer and Lhca1/Lhca5 dimer) and 735 nm (Lhca1/Lhca4 dimer). The apoprotein corresponding to the mature form of Lhca5 of A. thaliana was expressed in E. coli and isolated as inclusion bodies. Separation of inclusion body protein in a fully denaturing gel resulted in the resolution of two intensely stained bands exhibiting apparent molecular masses of 24.2 and 25.1 kDa, respectively, as deduced from comparison with molecular mass standard proteins (Fig. 1, middle lane). Immunoblot analyses with Lhca5 antibodies raised against a peptide of the N terminus of the protein of A. thaliana detected both bands (Fig. 1, right lane). The apparent molecular mass of the lower band corresponds well to the theoretical mass of 24.3 kDa, deduced from translated cDNA sequence using the default values of the ExPASy peptide mass tool at www.expasy.org/tools/peptidemass.html. Because of its size, the upper band is most probably the consequence of translational readthrough of the first stop codon and termination by the next stop codon located six codons downstream. This phenomenon was also observed in Lhca4 (7Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To test whether Lhca5 actually is a pigment-binding protein we reconstituted the protein with total pigment extract and separated the reconstitution mixture using partially denaturing gel electrophoresis. Fig. 2 reveals the formation of a stable r-Lhca5, proving that Lhca5 is indeed an LHC apoprotein. Former studies with other Lhc proteins demonstrated that the omission of individual pigments from the reconstitution mixture had an impact on the formation of stable LHCs. To elucidate which pigments are necessary for the formation of stable r-Lhca5, the apoprotein was reconstituted with different pigment mixtures, each lacking an individual pigment species, and the mixtures were separated on partially denaturing gels. From Fig. 2 it is obvious that omission of Chl a or individual carotenoids resulted in an r-Lhca5 yield comparable with that obtained from reconstitutions with all pigments or total pigment extract. By contrast, loss of r-Lhca5 formation was observed when reconstitutions were performed in the absence of Chl b. To analyze the pigment stoichiometry of r-Lhca5, reconstitution mixtures were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation to achieve separation of pigments not bound to protein from r-Lhca5. The band containing monomeric LHC was collected and used for high pressure liquid chromatography measurements (Fig. 3). According to the recently published crystal structure of pea PSI (1Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), each Lhca protein binds 12 Chl molecules. Therefore, the pigment content of r-Lhca5 is presented on the basis of 12 Chls. Pigment binding of Lhca5 is rather specific, as the pigment ratio differs significantly from that in the total pigment extract used for reconstitution (Fig. 3). On average, r-Lhca5 binds 8.6 Chl a and 3.4 Chl b, resulting in a Chl a/b ratio of 2.6. The carotenoid content is quite high and amounts to 2.7. Lut is the most abundant xanthophyll present in almost two (1.9) copies per 12 Chls. The other carotenoids are all present in substoichiometric amounts. Vio is found at a ratio of 0.3 per 12 Chls. Small amounts of neoxanthin (neo; 0.35) as well as β-car (0.2) were also associated with r-Lhca5. To assure the functionality of r-Lhca5, sucrose density gradient bands containing monomeric r-Lhca5 were used to record 77 K fluorescence emission spectra after excitation at 410 and 470 nm. Both spectra (Fig. 4) exhibit one distinct emission peak at 684 nm. A long wavelength fluorescence emission peak is not present. The fluorescence peak originating from uncoupled Chl b at 650 nm is rather small, demonstrating proper energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a. The presence of only one band in partially denaturing gels (Figs. 2 and 5A) indicates that r-Lhca5 only occurs in a monomeric form. To confirm this assumption, r-Lhca5 was additionally separated by more gentle sucrose density gradient centrifugation. This also yielded only one band co-sedimenting with monomeric Lhca1 to Lhca4, which indicates that Lhca5 forms monomeric LHCs but no homodimers (Fig. 5, A and B). The possible formation of heterodimers, such as the one formed by Lhca1 and Lhca4, was investigated by reconstitution of Lhca5 with each of the other Lhca proteins. Neither in partially denaturing gels nor in sucrose density gradients could a dimer band comparable with that of LHCI-730 (Fig. 5, A and B) be resolved. However, in sucrose density gradients an additional band migrating lower than the monomeric band was detectable when Lhca5 was reconstituted together with Lhca1. Analysis of these two bands by denaturing SDS-PAGE revealed that both bands contain the Lhca1 and Lhca5 apoprotein (not shown), which indicates interaction between Lhca5 and Lhca1. To analyze this finding in more detail, the ratio of the two apoproteins in the reconstitution mixture was varied. Fig. 6A shows that the yield of the lower LHC band was highest at Lhca5/Lhca1 ratios of 1:1 and 5:1. Analyses of the protein composition of the sucrose density gradient bands by fully denaturing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B) demonstrated that only the upper band reflected the protein ratio of the reconstitution mixture, whereas the lower band contained the two proteins in approximately equal amounts. This strongly indicates the formation of an Lhca1 and Lhca5 heterodimer.Fig. 6Influence of the Lhca5/Lhca1 ratio in the reconstitution mixture on dimer formation. Lhca5 and Lhca1 apoproteins were used at the indicated ratio and reconstituted with total pigment extract. In panel A, the band pattern of reconstitution mixtures separated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation is shown. Panel B depicts the protein composition of sucrose gradient bands analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

To analyze potential differences between the excitation energy transfer in the Lhca1/Lhca5 dimer versus that in the Lhca1/Lhca4 dimer, 77 K excitation spectra of both dimers were recorded (Fig. 7B). The excitation spectrum obtained for the Lhca1/Lhca5 dimer clearly differs from that of the Lhca1/Lhca4 dimer in the absorption region of Chl b and the carotenoids. In the Lhca1/Lhca5 dimer, pigments absorbing at 465 and 472 nm contribute stronger to Chl a fluorescence emission. To elucidate whether these differences arise from dimerization, excitation spectra of Lhca1 and Lhca5 monomers were additionally measured. Fig. 7B reveals that in Lhca5, Chl b and the carotenoids make stronger contributions to fluorescence emission than in Lhca1. Comparison of the excitation spectra of the Lhca1 and Lhca5 monomers and the Lhca1/Lhca5 dimer shows that the difference in the Chl b and carotenoid absorption region is partially caused by the Lhca5 monomer (inset in Fig. 7B). However, the curves of monomeric Lhca1 and Lhca5 do not sum up to that of the Lhca1/Lhca5 dimer, as is obvious from comparison with the calculated average spectrum of the monomers. Therefore, a slight increase in the contribution of Chl b and the carotenoids in the Lhca1/Lhca5 dimer appears to be caused by dimerization. In this study, we demonstrate that Lhca5 binds pigments and is actually an additional LHC apoprotein. Reconstitutions of Lhca5 led to the formation of pigment-protein complexes that could be isolated by partially denaturing gel electrophoresis and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The high reproducibility of its pigment composition indicates that pigment binding is specific. In addition, the observed energy transfer from Chl b to Chl a corroborates the light-harve"
https://openalex.org/W1996819283,"How restriction enzymes with their different specificities and mode of cleavage evolved has been a long standing question in evolutionary biology. We have recently shown that several Type II restriction endonucleases, namely SsoII (↓CCNGG), PspGI (↓CCWGG), Eco-RII (↓CCWGG), NgoMIV (G↓CCGGC), and Cfr10I (R↓CCGGY), which recognize similar DNA sequences (as indicated, where the downward arrows denote cleavage position), share limited sequence similarity over an interrupted stretch of ∼70 amino acid residues with MboI, a Type II restriction endonuclease from Moraxella bovis (Pingoud, V., Conzelmann, C., Kinzebach, S., Sudina, A., Metelev, V., Kubareva, E., Bujnicki, J. M., Lurz, R., Luder, G., Xu, S. Y., and Pingoud, A. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 329, 913–929). Nevertheless, MboI has a dissimilar DNA specificity (↓GATC) compared with these enzymes. In this study, we characterize MboI in detail to determine whether it utilizes a mechanism of DNA recognition similar to SsoII, PspGI, EcoRII, NgoMIV, and Cfr10I. Mutational analyses and photocross-linking experiments demonstrate that MboI exploits the stretch of ∼70 amino acids for DNA recognition and cleavage. It is therefore likely that MboI shares a common evolutionary origin with SsoII, PspGI, EcoRII, NgoMIV, and Cfr10I. This is the first example of a relatively close evolutionary link between Type II restriction enzymes of widely different specificities.

This is the first example of a relatively close evolutionary link between Type II restriction enzymes of widely different specificities. Restriction enzymes are components of restriction-modification systems that protect bacteria and archaea from invading foreign DNA (1Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 2Bickle T.A. Kruger D.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 434-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Szybalski W. Blumenthal R.M. Brooks J.E. Hattman S. Raleigh E.A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 279-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Four different types of restriction enzymes are known (4Roberts R.J. Belfort M. Bestor T. Bhagwat A.S. Bickle T.A. Bitinaite J. Blumenthal R.M. Degtyarev S. Dryden D.T. Dybvig K. Firman K. Gromova E.S. Gumport R.I. Halford S.E. Hattman S. Heitman J. Hornby D.P. Janulaitis A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) that differ in quaternary structure, cofactor dependence, and mode of DNA recognition and cleavage. Type II enzymes recognize short, typically palindromic sequences and cleave the DNA within or in close proximity to the recognition site (5Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar, 6Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 7Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3705-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). More than 3570 different Type II restriction enzymes with ∼240 unique specificities have been biochemically characterized (8Roberts R.J. Vincze T. Posfai J. Macelis D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Remarkably, little sequence similarity has been observed between the more than 200 Type II restriction enzymes that have been sequenced to date. The few exceptions consist of isoschizomers that cleave the same sequence at the same position, e.g. EcoRI and RsrI (G↓AATTC) (9Stephenson F.H. Ballard B.T. Boyer H.W. Rosenberg J.M. Greene P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), MthTI and NgoPII (GG↓CC) (10Nolling J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5719-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), XmaI and CfrI (C↓CCGGG) (11Withers B.E. Ambroso L.A. Dunbar J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6267-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and Cfr10I and Bse634I (R↓CCGGY) (12Grazulis S. Deibert M. Rimseliene R. Skirgaila R. Sasnauskas G. Lagunavicius A. Repin V. Urbanke C. Huber R. Siksnys V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 876-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Still, most isoschizomers do not share significant sequence similarity. Limited sequence similarity has also been observed in some cases among restriction enzymes that recognize partially related sequences, e.g. EcoRI (G↓AATTC) and MunI (C↓AATTG) (13Siksnys V. Zareckaja N. Vaisvila R. Timinskas A. Stakenas P. Butkus V. Janulaitis A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and SsoII (↓CCWGG) and PspGI (↓CCNGG) (14Morgan R. Xiao J. Xu S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, prior to 1995 the prevailing view was that restriction enzymes are not evolutionarily related (15Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2539-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Heitman J. Genet. Eng. (N. Y.). 1993; 15: 57-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This notion changed as additional crystal structures of restriction enzymes became available, clearly demonstrating these proteins to have a highly similar structural core that consists of a four-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices and that harbors the characteristic PD... (D/E)XK motif active site (17Anderson J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 24-30Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Venclovas C. Timinskas A. Siksnys V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between the amino acid sequences (“genotype”) of restriction enzymes and their recognition sequences and mode of cleavage (“phenotype”); these findings were interpreted as evidence for an evolutionary relationship among Type II restriction endonucleases (20Jeltsch A. Kroger M. Pingoud A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is little doubt now that Type II restriction enzymes of the PD... (D/E)XK superfamily evolved via divergent evolution (21Bujnicki J.M. Pingoud A. Restriction Endonucleases. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 63-93Google Scholar), a process that was accelerated by frequent exchange of restriction-modification systems through horizontal gene transfer among bacteria and archaea (22Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only slowly do we begin to understand the evolution of type II restriction enzymes. As mentioned above, amino acid sequence similarities among Type II restriction enzymes appear to be restricted to enzymes that recognize the same or similar DNA sequences and that cleave the DNA at the same position. The paradigm is the correlation first detected for SsoII (↓CCNGG) and PspGI (↓CCWGG) (14Morgan R. Xiao J. Xu S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was subsequently verified and extended to include EcoRII (↓CCWGG), NgoMIV (G↓CCGGC), and Cfr10I (R↓CCGGY) (23Pingoud V. Kubareva E.

Xu S.Y. Pingoud A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 913-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this group of related enzymes and their close relatives (SsoII: Kpn2kI/Ecl18kI/StyD4I/SenPI; Cfr10I: Bse634I/BsrFI) comprises: (i) Type IIP enzymes such as SsoII and PspGI, homodimeric enzymes that recognize palindromic sequences; (ii) Type IIE enzymes such as EcoRII, homodimeric enzymes that need two recognition sequences for DNA cleavage, one sequence being cleaved and the other serving as an effector (26Mucke M. Kruger D.H. Reuter M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6079-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Halford S.E. Bilcock D.T. Stanford N.P. Williams S.A. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 297-317Google Scholar); and (iii) Type IIF enzymes such as NgoMIV and Cfr10I, homotetrameric enzymes that cleave, in a concerted manner, DNA with two recognition sites (26Mucke M. Kruger D.H. Reuter M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6079-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Halford S.E. Bilcock D.T. Stanford N.P. Williams S.A. Milsom S.E. Gormley N.A.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 237-259Google Scholar). These enzymes share sequence similarities over a stretch of ∼70 amino acid residues, interrupted by two gaps of variable length (Fig. 1). This region is part of the conserved core of the PD... (D/E)XK superfamily of Type II restriction endonucleases. In NgoMIV, for which a co-crystal structure is available (31Deibert M. Grazulis S. Sasnauskas G. Siksnys V. Huber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), this region encompasses helices 3 and 7 and β-strands 2 and 3 that are involved in DNA recognition and cleavage. The involvement of this region in DNA binding and cleavage by Cfr10I and EcoRII is also apparent from crystal structures (32Bozic D. Grazulis S. Siksnys V. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Zhou X.E. Wang Y. Reuter M. Mucke M. Kruger D.H. Meehan E.J. Chen L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For SsoII and PspGI, mutational analysis and protein-DNA cross-linking determined this region to be likewise important (23Pingoud V. Kubareva E. Stengel G. Friedhoff P. Bujnicki J.M. Urbanke C. Sudina A. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Pingoud V. Conzelmann C. Kinzebach S. Sudina A. Metelev V. Kubareva E. Bujnicki J.M. Lurz R. Luder G. Xu S.Y. Pingoud A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 913-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SsoII, PspGI, EcoRII, NgoMIV, and Cfr10I belong to the superfamily of PD... (D/E)XK enzymes but have a variant configuration of the active site in which the second carboxylate (D/E) is replaced by serine (SsoII, NgoMIV, or Cfr10I), threonine (PspGI), or alanine (EcoRII). The catalytic role of the second carboxylate in these enzymes is assumed by a glutamate that is 15 or 16 residues downstream, as shown for Cfr10I by mutational replacement (34Skirgaila R. Grazulis S. Bozic D. Huber R. Siksnys V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). That these five enzymes (and their close relatives, see above) belong to different families (Type IIP, Type IIE, and Type IIF) is interpreted as their having a common ancestor, presumably a homodimeric enzyme that already had the variant active site and that acquisition of an effector domain (Type IIE) or generation of a dimer-dimer interface (Type IIF) is a more recent event in evolution (23Pingoud V. Kubareva E. Stengel G. Friedhoff P. Bujnicki J.M. Urbanke C. Sudina A. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although this evolutionary relationship is well supported by a previous structure-function relationship study of SsoII and PspGI, the suggestion that other Type II restriction enzymes that recognize unrelated sequences, such as ↓GATC, G↓GYRCC, and GG↓CC (25Pingoud V. Conzelmann C. Kinzebach S. Sudina A. Metelev V. Kubareva E. Bujnicki J.M. Lurz R. Luder G. Xu S.Y. Pingoud A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 913-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), are evolutionarily related to SsoII, PspGI, EcoRII, NgoMIV, and Cfr10I has not yet been explored experimentally. Here, we present a detailed biochemical analysis of MboI, a Type II restriction enzyme from Moraxella bovis that recognizes and cleaves the sequence ↓GATC (35Gelinas R.E. Myers P.A. Roberts R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 36Ueno T. Ito H. Kimizuka F. Kotani H. Nakajima K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2309-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MboI shares sequence similarity with EcoRII, NgoMIV, Cfr10I, SsoII, and PspGI over precisely the region in these enzymes involved in DNA binding and cleavage. However, as evident in Fig. 1, unlike these enzymes, MboI does not have the variant PD... (D/E)XK motif but rather another variation, namely FD... ETN, related to the catalytic motif of BglII, i.e. ID.. .EVQ (37Lukacs C.M. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that MboI, like SsoII and PspGI, is a Type IIP enzyme: a homodimer, both in the absence and presence of DNA, that cleaves DNA with one site as efficiently as DNA with two sites. Extensive mutational analysis reveals amino acid residues that appear conserved in the alignment with SsoII, PspGI, EcoRII, NgoMIV, and Cfr10I are critical for DNA binding and/or catalysis by MboI. Lys-209 in MboI, suggested by the alignment with Arg-194 in NgoMIV to make a base-specific contact, forms a zero-length cross-link with 5-iododeoxyuridine (5-IdU) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-IdU, 5-iododeoxyuridine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; IMAC, immobilized metal-affinity chromatography; HF, hydrogen fluoride; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; TOF, time-of-flight. in an oligodeoxyribonucleotide carrying a GATC recognition site in which the A is substituted by 5-IdU. We conclude from these results that MboI shares a common structure and evolutionary origin with SsoII, PspGI, EcoRII, NgoMIV, and Cfr10I. This is the first example of a close evolutionary link between Type II restriction enzymes of completely different specificities. Site-directed Mutagenesis of MboI Variants—Site-directed mutagenesis of the MboI gene was performed using a PCR-based technique (38Kirsch R.D. Joly E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mutant genes were sequenced and found to contain only the desired mutation. Protein Expression and Purification—His6-tagged MboI and its variants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified to near homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Fractions containing pure MboI were collected and dialyzed against buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0). DNA Binding Assay—MboI protein dimer (0.5 nm to 10 μm) was mixed with 5 nm 32P-labeled 188-bp PCR product (containing one MboI recognition site) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.5) supplemented with 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation for 15 min at ambient temperature, the samples were applied to a 6% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed for 3.5 h at 80 V (10 V/cm) in 20 mm Tris acetate, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.5, and the gels subjected to autoradiography using an instant imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Binding constants were determined by a linear least-square fit of the data to a simple A + B = C binding model. Gel-shift experiments to compare DNA binding by MboI to a substrate containing two recognition sites were done with a 5 nm 32P-labeled 352-bp PCR product. DNA Cleavage Assay—DNA cleavage activity of wild-type MboI and its variants was determined by incubating protein with 32P-labeled 188-bp PCR product in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0) at 37 °C for different times depending on the activity of the variant. Protein and DNA concentrations are indicated in Table I. Experiments designed to compare the rates of cleavage by wild-type MboI of one- versus two-site substrates were performed with two different PCR products containing one (188 bp) or two recognition sites (352 bp), respectively, in the absence or presence of a specific double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide d(CATACGAGGATCCATTCGCT) (US20/LS20). Reaction conditions are given in the legend to Fig. 4. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, which were subsequently subjected to autoradiography using an instant imager (Packard Instrument Co.).Table IRelative DNA cleavage and binding activity of MboI variantsConstructCleavage activityBinding activity%KdMboI-wt1007 nmMboI-N138A5610 nmMboI-R140A<0.01>10 μmMboI-R140K0.1>10 μmMboI-N142A<0.01>1 μmMboI-N142S<0.01>1 μmMboI-R143A<0.01>10 μmMboI-R143K0.05>10 μmMboI-D146K887 nmMboI-S149E0.756 nmMboI-D186A<0.016.5 nmMboI-E199A<0.017 nmMboI-N201A310 nmMboI-N201K<0.01>440 nmMboI-Y203A0.02>1 μmMboI-S208A<0.01>1 μmMboI-K209A0.2330 nmMboI-K209R0.45.4 nmMboI-N211A647.4 nmMboI-E212Q0.36.2 nmMboI-R215A0.046 nmMboI-R215K0.45.6 nm Open table in a new tab Fig. 4DNA cleavage by MboI in the absence or presence of a specific double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide. A,25nm 32P-labeled 188-bp PCR product containing one recognition site was incubated with 1.25 nm MboI-wt dimer at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken after 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min, respectively, and analyzed by electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography using an instant imager. B, cleavage of the one-site substrate in the absence (▴) or presence of 25 nm (•) or 250 nm (▪) of a 20-bp double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing one recognition site was evaluated quantitatively. Addition of oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrates leads to a concentration-dependent inhibition of cleavage of the 188-bp PCR product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Determination of the Mg2+- and Mn2+ Concentration Dependence— Mg2+ (0.05–50 mm) and Mn2+ (0.005–2.5 mm) concentration dependence of DNA cleavage by MboI was measured with cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0–150 mm NaCl to maintain a constant ionic strength. Cleavage was measured with an enzyme concentration of 0.5 nm (Mg2+ dependence) or 1 nm (Mn2+ dependence) MboI dimer and a substrate concentration of 37 nm 188-bp PCR product containing a single cleavage site. Cleavage reactions were performed for 15 (Mg2+ dependence) or 30 (Mn2+ dependence) min at 37 °C. Determination of the Salt Concentration Dependence—Salt concentration dependence of DNA cleavage by MboI was measured in buffers (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0) containing varying concentrations of NaCl (0–200 mm). Cleavage was measured at an enzyme concentration of 1.25 nm MboI dimer and a substrate concentration of 25 nm 188-bp PCR product containing a single cleavage site. Cleavage reactions were performed for 4 min at 37 °C. Determination of the pH Dependence—A triple buffer containing 25 mm MES, 25 mm sodium acetate, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (39Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) was prepared at various pH values. This buffer was chosen to maintain constant ionic strength across the pH range examined. The cleavage rate was measured within the range pH 4.5–10 with an enzyme concentration of 2.5 nm MboI dimer and a substrate concentration of 25 nm 188-bp PCR product containing a single cleavage site. Cleavage reactions were performed for 4 min at 37 °C. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration experiments were performed at room temperature on a Merck-Hitachi high-performance liquid chromatography system using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. Wild type MboI was diluted in the same buffer, which was loaded onto the column, and chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The molecular mass was determined by interpolation, using a calibration curve of proteins of known molecular mass (molecular weight marker kit, Sigma). Transmission Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopy, DNA fragments of 188 and 352 bp in length, containing one or two recognition sites for MboI, respectively, were produced by PCR and purified. In a reaction volume of 20 μl, 30 ng of DNA was incubated with 30 or 60 ng of MboI (the molar ratio of recognition sites to MboI monomers was ∼3.5 or 7, respectively) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 for 15 min at 23 °C, fixed for 10 min with 0.2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, and prepared by adsorption to mica as described previously (40Friedhoff P. Lurz R. Luder G. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23581-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Photocross-linking—For analytical scale photocross-linking, 10 μm MboI dimer was preincubated with 10 μm double-stranded eicosadeoxyribonucleotide monosubstituted with 5-IdU at various positions in the recognition site (underlined) or the two flanking positions, namely 5′-CATACGAGGATCCATTCGCT-3′ (Thermo Hybaid) in buffer P (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) for 10 min at ambient temperature in a volume of 25 μl. Photocross-linking was carried out with a 40-milliwatt helium/cadmium laser emitting at 325 nm (Laser 2000). The total irradiation time was typically 45 min, or 0–90 min in kinetic experiments. Samples of 5 μl were taken before and after cross-linking and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were silver-stained, and radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography with intensifying screens or using an imager. For preparative isolation of a cross-linked MboI-oligodeoxyribonucleotide complex (see below), 20 μm MboI dimer was preincubated with 20 μm double-stranded dodecadeoxyribonucleotide monosubstituted with 5-IdU at the A of the recognition sequence, namely 5′-CGAGGATCCATT-3′ (US12-A-1/LS12, Biomers) in buffer P in a volume of 100 μl. A small amount of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide was radioactively 5′-end-labeled with 32P-phosphate. Digestion of the Cross-linked MboI-dodecadeoxyribonucleotide Complex—Cross-linked complex (125 μl and 2.5 nmol) of MboI and dodecadeoxyribonucleotide US12-A-1/LS12 was incubated at 37 °C overnight with 15.5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science) or a combination of 9.5 μg of trypsin and 9.5 μg of chymotrypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science) or with 12.5 μg of proteinase K (Fermentas). Aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and 2 m urea (41Geyer H. Geyer R. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e132Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After complete digestion, samples were precipitated in the presence of 1/10 volume of 4 m LiCl and 3 volumes of ethanol, dissolved in 0.1 m acetic acid, and loaded onto Fe3+-IMAC columns prepared from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen) by Ni2+/Fe3+ exchange according to a previous study (42Stensballe A. Jensen O.N. Olsen J.V. Haselmann K.F. Zubarev R.A. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Only unreacted oligodeoxyribonucleotides and peptide-DNA hetero-conjugates were retained on the IMAC column when washed as described before (43Steen H. Petersen J. Mann M. Jensen O.N. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1989-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The retained DNA-containing components were eluted with 2 × 600 μl of H2O, pH 10.5 (adjusted with NH3), and evaporated in a SpeedVac. The dried material was dissolved in 40 μl of H2O. Mass Spectrometry—Hydrogen fluoride (HF) treatment: selective cleavage of phosphodiester linkages was performed according to a previous study (44Ferguson M.A. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) using a modified protocol (45Lochnit G. Dennis R.D. Ulmer A.J. Geyer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 466-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, dried samples were incubated with 50 μl of 48% HF (Merck) at 4 °C overnight. The reagent was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and dried samples were dissolved in 50 μl of methanol and dried again; this procedure was repeated once. MALDI-MS and MS/MS spectra were recorded using an Ultraflex time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a LIFT-MS/MS facility. Samples were prepared on an AnchorChip™ 600/384 target plate. For oligodeoxyribonucleotides and oligodeoxyribonucleotide-peptide heteroconjugates, a saturated solution of 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile/water (45:65, v/v), containing 10% diammoniumhydrogen citrate was used as matrix. Matrix solution (0.5 μl) was applied to the anchor chip and allowed to dry. Then 0.5–1 μl of analyte was added, and the chip was dried again. HF-treated cross-linked complexes were analyzed as described in detail previously (46Lochnit G. Geyer R. Biomed. Chromatogr. 2004; 18: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The MALDI mass spectra obtained were externally calibrated using either an oligodeoxyribonucleotide calibration standard or peptide calibration standard II (both from Bruker). Fragment ion analysis in the tandem time-of-flight (TOF-TOF) mode was performed as described (47Wuhrer M. Robijn M.L. Koeleman C.A. Balog C.I. Geyer R. Deelder A.M. Hokke C.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Structure Prediction—Secondary structure prediction and protein-fold recognition was carried out via the GeneSilico metaserver gateway (genesilico.pl/meta/ (48Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3305-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar)). The reported alignments between the MboI sequence and structures of PD... (D/E)XK nucleases were used as starting points for homology modeling using the “Frankenstein's monster” approach, comprising cycles of model building, evaluation/scoring, realignment in poorly scored regions, and merging of best scoring fragments (49Kosinski J. Cymerman I.A. Feder M. Kurowski M.A. Sasin J.M. Bujnicki J.M. Proteins. 2003; 53: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out with His6-tagged MboI (wild type and mutants) isolated from an overproducing E. coli strain and purified to near homogeneity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Analysis of DNA Cleavage by MboI—Optimum DNA cleavage conditions, a prerequisite for the analysis of structure-function relationships, were determined for MboI. Experiments carried out to assess the Mg2+/Mn2+, ionic strength, and pH dependence of DNA cleavage by MboI show that this enzyme, like many Type II restriction endonucleases, has an Mg2+ (Mn2+) optimum between 1 and 10 mm (0.1 and 1 mm, corrected for ionic strength), requires ∼100 mm salt for optimal activity, and shows an increase in cleavage activity with pH in the range between 5 and 10 (data not shown). Classification of MboI as a Type IIP Enzyme—The presumptive distant relatives of MboI are Type IIP (SsoII and PspGI), Type IIE (EcoRII), and Type IIF (NgoMIV"

Transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP is expressed throughout the brain where it localizes to synapses and marks synapses in vivo. However, when we crossed transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP mice with synaptotagmin 1 knock-out mice, we detected no rescue of survival or function. Furthermore, viral overexpression of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP in synaptotagmin 1-deficient neurons failed to restore normal Ca2+-triggered release, whereas overexpression of wild type synaptotagmin 1 did so efficiently. To determine whether synaptotagmin 1-ECFP is non-functional because the ECFP-fusion interferes with its biochemical activities, we measured Ca2+-independent binding of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP to SNARE complexes, and Ca2+-dependent binding of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP to phospholipids and to itself. Although the apparent Ca2+ affinity of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP was decreased compared with wild type synaptotagmin 1, we observed no major changes in Ca2+-dependent or -independent activities, indicating that the non-functionality of the synaptotagmin 1-ECFP fusion protein was not because of inactivation of its biochemical properties. These data suggest that synaptotagmin 1-ECFP is suitable for monitoring synaptic vesicle traffic in vivo because the synaptotagmin 1-ECFP marks synaptic vesicles without participating in exocytosis. In addition, the data demonstrate that synaptotagmin 1 function requires a free C terminus, possibly because of spatial constraints at the release sites.

In addition, the data demonstrate that synaptotagmin 1 function requires a free C terminus, possibly because of spatial constraints at the release sites. Synapses are the major points of information processing in brain. The number, structure, and properties of synapses change dramatically during the development and maturation of the brain and possibly as a function of experience (see Refs. 1Foeller E. Feldman D.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and 2Kauer J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar for a review of such mechanisms). Visualizing synapses directly would provide a valuable tool for studying synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Recent advances in transgenic techniques have provided exciting methods for examining neuronal shape in living animals (reviewed in Ref. 3Inoue A. Okabe S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This was spectacularly achieved with the generation of transgenic mice in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EPSC, excitatory postsynaptic current; IPSC, inhibitory postsynaptic current; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; KO, knock-out; GST, glutathione S-transferase.-derivatives are expressed under control of the Thy1 promoter in a manner that allows the reproducible synthesis of the transgenic protein in only a subset of neurons (4De Paola V. Arber S. Caroni P. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W.

These mice were invaluable, for example, in examining the stability of synapses in adult brain (6Grutzendler J. Kasthuri N. Gan W.B. Nature. 2002; 420: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 7Trachtenberg J.T. Chen B.E. Knott G.W. Feng G. Sanes J.R. Welker E. Svoboda K. Nature. 2002; 420: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). However, although the selective labeling of a subset of neurons in transgenic mice (4De Paola V. Arber S. Caroni P. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 2000; 28: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) provides an advantage for longitudinal studies of plastic changes in individual neurons, it is disadvantageous for studies of entire neuronal populations. A possible strategy for labeling presynaptic terminals in transgenic mice would be to express specifically presynaptic molecules that are labeled with GFP. In pursuing such a strategy, we have examined the localization, properties and function of a chimeric synaptic protein (synaptotagmin 1; Ref. 8Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) fused to a GFP-derivative (ECFP) (9Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin 1 is an abundant synaptic vesicle protein that contains an N-terminal intraluminal sequence, a single transmembrane region, a central linker, and two C-terminal C2-domains. The C2-domains account for the majority of the synaptotagmin 1 sequence and function as separate Ca2+-binding domains in a complex with phospholipids (10Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fernandez I.

Synaptotagmin 1 functions as a Ca2+ sensor for the fast component of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis in vertebrate neurons (13Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), neuroendocrine cells (14Voets T. Moser T. Lund P.E. Chow R.H. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Neuron. 2002; 36: 897-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Changing the apparent Ca2+ affinity of synaptotagmin 1 causes an equivalent change in the Ca2+ affinity of release (16Fernández-Chacón R. Konigstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Matos M.F.

Physiol. 2003; 122: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanism of action of synaptotagmin 1 as a Ca2+ sensor remains unclear (18Tokuoka H. Goda Y. Neuron. 2003; 38: 521-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition to functioning in exocytosis, synaptotagmin 1 is also involved in endocytosis (19Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10708-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Jorgensen E.M. Hartwieg E.

Nature. 2003; 426: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) possibly by virtue of its interactions with clathrin-associated adaptor molecules (22Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 23Haucke V. Wenk M.R. Chapman E.R. Farsad K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6011-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A potential problem in labeling synapses with ECFP-fusion proteins is that such proteins may have functional effects on synapses. For example, the overexpression of wild type synaptotagmin 1 on a wild type background alters synaptic neurotransmitter release (24Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To assess this possibility, we have in the present study also examined the functionality of the synaptotagmin 1-ECFP fusion protein that we are using to label presynaptic terminals. Our data demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing synaptotagmin 1-ECFP are useful tools of following presynaptic terminals in vivo but that the ECFP fusion inactivates synaptotagmin 1 functionally and thereby the synaptotagmin ECFP fusion protein is only a label at synapses without inserting itself as a functional component into the fusion machinery. Animal Welfare—All experiments involving animals performed for this study were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal use committee. Vector Construction—1) The transgenic vector pThy1-Syt1-ECFP was obtained by subcloning a 3-kb XhoI-XhoI fragment from pCMV5-Syt1-ECFP-wp (24Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) into the XhoI site of the Thy1 minigene vector (generous gift of Dr. M. Goedert, MRC Laboratory Cambridge, UK) that contains the Thy1 genes without exon 3 and flanking introns to achieve neuron-specific expression (25Caroni P. J. Neurosci.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 2) The Semliki Forest virus vector pSFV-Syt1-ECFP was made by inserting a 2-kb XhoI-XmaI of pCMV5-Syt1-ECFP into pSFV-wp by blunt end ligation. pSFV-wp and pSFV-Syt1 were described previously (24Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 3) GST fusion vectors pGEX-Syt1-C2AB-ECFP were made by cloning a 1-kb Eco47 III-XbaI fragment of pCMV5-Syt1-ECFP into the same sites of pGEX-Syt1-C2AB. pGEX-Syt1-C2B-ECFP was produced by cloning a 1-kb Eco47 III-Eco47 III fragment into the EcoRI site of pGEX-KG by blunt end ligation. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice were generated by injection of gel-purified pThy1-Syt1-ECFP DNA into fertilized oocytes using standard techniques (28Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacey E. Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Transgenic founders were identified by DNA dot blotting and confirmed by PCR (see below). Six founders from six injections were backcrossed to BL6SJL/F1 hybrid mice for 1–2 generations before protein and morphology analysis, and the two lines with the highest expression levels were retained for further experiments. The genotypes of transgenic mice were determined by PCR using the following primers, wh108 (TTGAGACTAAAGTCCACCGG, from synaptotagmin 1) and wh138 (CTTATCGATACGCGTGGTAC, from the linker sequence between synaptotagmin 1 and ECFP). PC12 Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. BHK21 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For imaging, PC12 cells were plated on polylysine (Sigma, 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m borate buffer)-coated cover glasses (18 mm, number 1.5, VWR). One day after plating, cells were transfected with DNA plasmids using Tfx-50 (Promega). Two days after transfection, cover glasses with cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and mounted on slides for confocal imaging. In Vitro Transcription and Viral Preparation—Linearized Semliki Forest virus plasmids were transcribed in vitro. The resulting RNA was transfected into BHK21 cells by electroporation (29Ashery U. Betz A. Xu T. Brose N. Rettig J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, cell culture media containing inactive virus were collected and frozen in aliquots. On the day of infection, thawed aliquots were activated with α-chymotrypsin, and cells were infected after the addition of aprotinin to inactivate α-chymotrypsin. Immunhistochemistry—1) Mice were anesthetized and perfused through the heart, first with PBS and then with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains and retinas were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2–4 h. After overnight immersion in 30% sucrose, tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Ted Pella, Inc.) and processed for cryostat sectioning. For overall assessment of transgene expression in brain regions, 30-μm sagittal cryosections were mounted on slides and sealed for imaging on a confocal microscope. To examine the synaptic localization of transgenic proteins, 10-μm cryosections of retina or diaphragm were mounted on slides and proceeded for fluorescence labeling using standard procedure. Briefly, slides with tissue sections were blocked in PBS containing 3% goat serum and 3% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking and permeabilization in blocking buffer containing 0.15% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, the retina sections were probed with a monoclonal antibody against Rab3A (Cl42.2, 1:1000) and Alexa 568-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Molecular Probes), while the diaphragm sections were probed with 0.1 mg/l Alexa-594-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes). Cover glasses were then mounted on slides and sealed for observation. 2) To prepare the whole-mount diaphragm for neuromuscular junction imaging, the diaphragm from adult mice was dissected out without fixation, washed in PBS, incubated in PBS containing 0.1 mg/l Alexa 594-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min, washed again in PBS, and mounted on slides. Whole mounts of treated diaphragms were visualized by confocal microscopy for ECFP fluorescence (green) and Alexa 594 fluorescence (red). 3) Neuronal cultures from wild type or transgenic mouse cortices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and labeled with a monoclonal antibody against Rab3A (Cl42.2, 1:1000) and Alexa 568-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Molecular Probes) and with a polyclonal antibody against GFP (T3743, 1:500) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Molecular Probes). Confocal Microscopy—Confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS2 Laser scanning confocal microscope using 10× air, 20× air, 63× oil (NA1.4), or 100× oil (NA1.4) objectives. In Fig. 2, images of A, B, C, and E were montages of up to 120 individual confocal sections that were assembled into a single image using Photoshop software (Adobe). Biochemical Assays—1) All recombinant proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in pGEX-KG and purified essentially as described (30Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 31Sugita S. Han W. Butz S. Liu X. Fernández-Chacón R. Lao Y. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2001; 30: 459-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To remove bacterial contaminants associated with C2B-domains (32Ubach J. Lao Y. Fernandez I. Arac D. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5854-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), bacterial extracts containing C2B-domain proteins were treated with 1,000 units/liter of benzonase (Novagen) for 1 h at room temperature, bound to glutathione-Sepharose (0.3 ml/liter culture), and washed with (i) 250 ml of PBS, (ii) 250 ml of 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, (iii) 250 ml of 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm CaCl2, (iv) 250 ml of 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, (v) 250 ml of 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and (vi) 250 ml of PBS. 2) For brain lysate preparation, three mouse forebrains were homogenized in 11 ml of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors, 11 ml of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, and 2% Nonidet P-40 were added, and then the homogenate was extracted for 4 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed from the extract by centrifugation (40 min at 100,000 × g), and MgCl2 was added to 2 mm final concentration. 3) For the assays for Ca2+-dependent self-association of synaptotagmin 1, 0.5-ml aliquots of the supernatant were mixed with 0.5 ml of 2× Ca2+-EGTA buffer (1× = 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 8 mm EGTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 0 or 1 mm free CaCl2. The mixture was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing ∼10 μg of immobilized GST fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C with rocking. The glutathione beads were washed six times in the respective binding buffers, and resuspended in 110 μlof1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. 10 μl of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against synaptotagmin 1 (Cl41.1), Syntaxin (HPC1), SNAP-25 (Cl71.1), and Synaptobrevin (Cl69.1). 4) Centrifugation phospholipid binding assays were carried out with purified soluble GST fusion proteins in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.8, 0.1 m NaCl, and 4 mm EGTA) using a centrifugation assay in which the C2-domain proteins are bound in solution to heavy liposomes at different concentrations of free Ca2+ essentially as described (12Fernandez I.

After binding, liposomes are isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion, and bound C2-domain proteins are precipitated, resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. 5) Syntaxin immunoprecipitations were performed with a polyclonal syntaxin 1 antibody (I378, 10 μl of serum) attached to protein A-Sepharose (10 μl, Pharmacia) and 500 μl of brain lysate prepared as described above. The binding reactions were incubated at 4 °C overnight with rocking, and Sepharose beads were washed six times with 1 ml of the corresponding buffers. Proteins bound to the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 20-μl aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against synaptotagmin 1 (Syt 1, Cl41.1), synaptophysin (Cl7.4), Rab3A (Cl42.2), Munc18, syntaxin 1 (HPC1), SNAP-25 (Cl71.1), and complexins (L668/669). Electrophysiological Analyses of Cultured Hippocampal Neurons in Autapses—Individual cultures of hippocampal neurons from all mice in a litter from heterozygous mutant/wild type synaptotagmin 1 mice were prepared at postnatal day 0 on microislands of glia cells (preplated in 10% fetal bovine serum) under conditions favoring formation of autapses and used for experiments after 10–20 days in culture. Before seeding neurons in a density of 500/cm2, the medium was exchanged to neurobasal medium A (Invitrogen) with supplement B27 (Invitrogen). Only dots containing single neurons were used. Semliki Forest virus constructs were prepared and used as described (29Ashery U. Betz A. Xu T. Brose N. Rettig J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rescue experiments using wild type and ECFP-fused synaptotagmin 1 constructs were performed in parallel. The extracellular recording solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, 10 mm glucose, 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 300 mosm. Synaptic transmission was recorded in the whole-cell configuration under voltage clamp using 1–2-ms depolarizations from -70 to 0 mV to induce action potentials. Hypertonic sucrose solutions contained 0.5 m sucrose in addition to the regular external solution. Patch pipette solutions included 125 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP-Na2, 15 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 1 mm EGTA buffer, pH 7.3, 300 mosm. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Electrophysiological Analyses of Cultured Cortical Neurons—Cortical neurons were cultured from newborn mice essentially as described for hippocampal neuron culture (24Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and analyzed by electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry at 14 days in vitro. To monitor synaptic responses, inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were evoked by local extracellular stimulation with a microelectrode and recorded in whole-cell mode using Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc). The pipette solution contained 135 mm CsCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm Na2-ATP, 1 mm Na-GTP, 1 mm QX-314, pH 7.4. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Excitatory AMPA/NMDA postsynaptic currents were blocked by addition of 50 μm AP-5 and 10 μm CNQX into bath solution. The currents were sampled at 10 kHz and analyzed using pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments Inc.). Miscellaneous Procedures—Equivalent amounts of forebrain homogenates from wild type and transgenic mice were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against synaptotagmin 1 (Cl41.1), GFP (T3743), Syntaxin (HPC1), SNAP-25 (Cl71.1), and Synaptobrevin (Cl69.1). For transgenic protein tissue distribution, different regions of transgenic mouse brain and various tissues were homogenized separately and quantified using BCA assay (Pierce). A similar amount of samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to Nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed using antibodies against synaptotagmin 1 (Cl41.1), GFP (T3743), and vasolin-containing protein (K330). Generation of Transgenic Mice Expressing Synaptotagmin 1-ECFP—To generate transgenic mice with fluorescent nerve terminals as a tool for studying synapse formation and function, we constructed a transgenic expression vector in which the Thy1 promoter (26Probst A. Gotz J. Wiederhold K.H. Tolnay M. Mistl C. Jaton A.L. Hong M. Ishihara T. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Spillantini M.G. Burki K. Goedert M. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 99: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) drives transcription of the coding sequence for synaptotagmin 1-ECFP (Fig. 1A). In the transgenic vector, the synaptotagmin 1-ECFP coding sequence is followed by a polyadenylation signal from human growth hormone and the SV40 enhancer to enhance transcription (Fig. 1A). The Thy1-gene vector we used lacks exon 3 and the flanking introns to make gene expression neuron-specific (27Vidal M. Morris R. Grosveld F. Spanopoulou E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We injected the transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP vector after removal of the vector backbone into fertilized oocytes and screened the resulting transgenic founders by DNA dot blotting (34Geppert M. Ullrich B. Green D.G. Takei K. Daniels L. De Camilli P. Südhof T.C. Hammer R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3720-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We then established lines from six transgenic founders by backcrossing to BL6SJL/F1 hybrid mice and analyzed the expression of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP in mouse brains from various lines by immunoblotting. In addition, we examined the location of the transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP protein by fluorescence microscopy. We found that all six lines exhibited a widespread expression of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP in the brain, although the levels and precise patterns of expression varied (data not shown). For detailed studies, we selected the two lines with the highest expression levels. We first analyzed the transgenic mice by immunoblotting. In total forebrain homogenates, immunoblotting for synaptotagmin 1 detected two bands in transgenic mice but only a single band in control mice (Fig. 1B). The upper synaptotagmin 1-reactive band in the transgenic mice (that was missing in control mice) was reactive with GFP antibodies, indicating that this band corresponds to the transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP (Fig. 1B, asterisk). Comparison of the total immunoreactivity of endogenous synaptotagmin 1 and transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP in the transgenic mice showed that the transgenic protein is expressed at slightly lower levels than the abundant endogenous synaptotagmin 1. To ensure that the overexpression of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP does not interfere with the expression of other synaptic proteins, we compared the levels of the three major synaptic SNARE proteins (SNAP-25, Synaptobrevin, and syntaxin 1) between transgenic and control mice but observed no major difference (Fig. 1B). We next probed the tissue specificity of transgene expression (Fig. 1C). Among the tissues investigated, both endogenous synaptotagmin 1 and transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP (Fig. 1C, marked with an asterisk) were only detectable in brain. Even prolonged exposure did not uncover an ECFP signal in non-neuronal tissues (Fig. 1C). Synaptotagmin 1 is very sensitive to proteolysis at a position in the linker between the transmembrane region and the first C2-domain (35Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple breakdown products of endogenous and of transgenic synaptotagmin 1 were observed (Fig. 1C, marked by plus signs; see in particular long ECFP exposure) that were absent when fresh brain tissue was dissolved in SDS sample buffer without dissection of brain regions as performed in Fig. 1B. Protein loads were controlled for by immunoblotting with a ubiquitously expressed marker protein, vasolin-containing protein. Widespread Expression of Transgenic Synaptotagmin 1-ECFP in Brain—We next examined brain sections from the transgenic mice by fluorescence microscopy. We found that synaptotagmin 1-ECFP was expressed in most regions of the forebrain (Fig. 2A). Highest levels of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP were detected in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and striatum. We observed a relatively uniform expression of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP in all regions of the thalamus (Fig. 2B). In contrast, expression in the hippocampus was heterogeneous. The mossy fiber terminals were particularly strongly labeled, whereas Schaffer collateral and dentate gyrus synapses exhibited much weaker ECFP fluorescence (Fig. 2C). The preferential labeling of mossy fiber terminals is evident from images at higher magnification that indicate a synaptic localization of synaptotagmin 1-ECFP (Fig. 2D). In the cortex, synaptotagmin 1-ECFP was also present in all layers consistent with a widespread expression (Fig. 2E). Even in the cerebellum, where little transgenic expression was evident from the fluorescence overviews acquired at low illumination intensity (Fig. 2A), images taken at higher magnification at high illumination intensity uncovered labeling of both the granule cell layer and the molecular layer (Fig. 2F). However, labeling in the molecular layer was weak, suggesting that transgene expression in the cerebellar granule cells was low. Synaptotagmin 1-ECFP Is Unable to Rescue Deletion of Synaptotagmin 1—We next crossed the transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP mice with synaptotagmin 1 KO mice (13Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) to test whether the transgenic protein could rescue the deletion phenotype. However, transgenic synaptotagmin 1-ECFP had no beneficial effect on the survival of synaptotagmin 1 KO mice, and electrophysiological recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons of transgenic mice failed to detect an improvement of the"
https://openalex.org/W2083995758,"Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) inhibit diacylglycerol (DAG) signaling by phosphorylating DAG. DGK-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of human neuronal DGKθ, inhibits neurotransmission to control behavior. DGK-1, like DGKθ, has three cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), a pleckstrin homology domain, and a kinase domain. To identify DGK domains and amino acid residues critical for terminating DAG signaling in vivo, we analyzed 20 dgk-1 mutants defective in DGK-1-controlled behaviors. We found by sequencing that the mutations included nine amino acid substitutions and seven premature stop codons that impair the physiological functions of DGK-1. All nine amino acid substitutions are in the second CRD, the third CRD, or the kinase domain. Thus, these domains are important for the termination of DAG signaling by DGK-1 in vivo. Seven of the substituted amino acid residues are present in all human DGKs and likely define key residues required for the function of all DGKs. An ATP-binding site mutation expected to inactivate the kinase domain retained very little physiological function, but we found two stop codon mutants predicted to truncate DGK-1 before its kinase domain that retained significantly more function. We detected novel splice forms of dgk-1 that can reconcile this apparent conflict, as they skip exons containing the stop codons to produce DGK-1 isoforms that contain the kinase domain. Two of these isoforms lack an intact pleckstrin homology domain and yet appear to have significant function. Additional novel isoform(s) account for all of the DGK-1 function necessary for one behavior, dopamine response."
https://openalex.org/W2153164047,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling is dependent on focal adhesions, structures that are enriched with tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. Because the non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) is enriched in focal adhesions and IL-1-induced ERK activation requires increased Ca2+, we determined whether SHP-2 modulates IL-1-induced Ca2+ signaling. In SHP-2-deficient fibroblasts, IL-1-induced Ca2+ signaling and ERK activation were markedly diminished compared with cells expressing SHP-2. IL-1-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum occurred in the vicinity of focal adhesions and was strongly inhibited by the blockage of phospholipase C (PLC) catalytic activity. Immunoprecipitation and immunostaining showed that SHP-2, the endoplasmic reticulum-specific protein calnexin, and PLCγ1 were associated with focal adhesions; however, these associations and IL-1-induced ERK activation dissipated after cells were plated on non-integrin substrates. IL-1 promoted phosphorylation of SHP-2 and PLCγ1. IL-1-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was diminished in SHP-2-deficient cells but was restored by stable transfection with SHP-2. BAPTA/AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)) blocked IL-1-induced phosphorylation of SHP-2 and PLCγ1, indicating mutually dependent interactive roles for Ca2+, SHP-2, and PLCγ1 in IL-1 signaling. We conclude that SHP-2 is critical for IL-1-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and thereby enhances IL-1-induced Ca2+ release and ERK activation.

IL-1 mediates the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins by enhancing the synthesis and secretion of proteases that are expressed by connective tissue cells including tissue macrophages and fibroblasts. The expression of matrix-degrading genes in these cells is regulated by the amplitude and duration of IL-1-induced signals (5Boyle D.L. Han Z. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Firestein G.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) of IL-1 signaling pathways in cultured fibroblasts have shown that the IL-1-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK requires the formation of focal adhesions, suggesting that focal adhesion-associated proteins such as integrins and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (10Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) may play critical, modulatory roles in the generation and regulation of IL-1-induced signals. Although IL-1 type 1 (signaling) receptors are confined largely to focal adhesions in cultured fibroblasts (10Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Qwarnstrom E.E. Page R.C. Gillis S. Dower S.K. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 324: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and thus may be responsible for the focal adhesion restriction of IL-1 signaling, it is likely that other focal adhesion proteins with intrinsic capacities for post-translational modification also contribute to this phenomenon. Many signaling systems in cells involve protein phosphorylation, which in turn is controlled by the net relative activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Notably, although tyrosine phosphatases may play a role in the termination of various receptor tyrosine kinase-induced signals, they often play positive roles in signaling as well. For example, several receptor tyrosine kinase-signaling pathways that lead to ERK activation utilize protein tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-2 to help sustain ERK activity (13Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), possibly by modulating signals from integrins or integrin-associated proteins. SHP-2 also has an impact on IL-1-induced ERK activation, and this activation is tightly linked to integrin clustering in focal adhesions (11Qwarnstrom E.E. Page R.C. Gillis S. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8261-8269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work (14Oh E.S. Gu H. Saxton T.M. Timms J.F. Hausdorff S. Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Pawson T. Neel B.G. Thomas S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3205-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) has established that SHP-2 is required for integrin-mediated ERK activation, possibly by Src family-related kinase phosphorylation of SHPS-1 and the recruitment of SHP-2 (13Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SHP-2 regulates cell spreading on fibronectin and focal adhesion formation (15Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms and the protein-protein interactions that are required for integrins and SHP-2 to mediate the IL-1 activation of ERK are not defined. Recent studies (16Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G. Araki T. Luo J. Thompson J.A. Schraven B.L. Philips M.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 341-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that SHP-2 regulates the activity of Src family kinases, and ultimately the activation of ERK, by controlling the recruitment of C-terminal Src kinase. The activation of ERK through the Src family kinase system is thought to involve the phosphorylation of PLCγ1, a step in the signaling pathway required for the release of calcium from internal stores and the subsequent activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (where MEK is mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) cascade. Ras activation may in turn rely on its anchorage to endoplasmic reticulum membranes (17Chiu V.K. Bivona T. Hach A. Sajous J.B. Silletti J. Wiener H. Johnson II, R.L. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) as well as its recruitment of SHP-2 to plasma and endoplasmic reticulum membranes (16Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I.

However, the mechanisms whereby the various participants in this signaling pathway are marshaled to specific sites within the cell are not known. As noted earlier, IL-1-induced ERK activation is focal adhesion-restricted (9Lo Y.Y. Luo L. McCulloch C.A. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), requires the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (18Wang Q. Downey G.P. Choi C. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1898-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and may depend on the sequestration of signaling molecules such as Ras to endoplasmic reticulum membranes (17Chiu V.K.

Accordingly, we considered that focal adhesions and the endoplasmic reticulum may provide spatially discrete staging sites (19Cohen P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) that enable the SHP-2-dependent activation of ERK by IL-1.

Latex microbeads were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) or BSA (2 mg/ml). For collagen coating (3 mg/ml acidified, pepsin-digested bovine type I collagen) (Celltrix, Palo Alto, CA), NaOH was added to the solution to a final concentration of 0.1 m to equilibrate the pH to 7.4 and thereby facilitate collagen fibril assembly on the beads.

In brief, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound beads and then scraped into ice-cold cytoskeleton extraction buffer (CSKB) (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8). The cell-bead suspension was sonicated for 10 s (output setting 3, power 15%), and the beads were isolated from the lysate using a magnetic separation stand. The beads were resuspended in fresh ice-cold CSKB, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), and re-isolated magnetically. The beads were washed in CSKB, sedimented with a microcentrifuge, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min to allow the collagen-associated complexes to dissociate from the beads. The beads were sedimented, and lysates were collected for analysis. Calcium Measurement—For measuring whole cell [Ca2+]i, cells on coverslips were loaded with 3 μm fura-2/AM for 20 min at 37 °C, and cells were measured by ratio fluorometry as described previously (23Ko K.S. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Ellen R.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For estimating the Ca2+ concentration near the plasma membrane (juxtamembrane concentration), cells attached to coverslips were briefly permeabilized with saponin and incubated with 2 μm fura-C18, pentapotassium salt at 25 °C for 20 min followed by washing with PBS (24Ko K.S. Arora P.D. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35967-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For estimating [Ca2+]ER, cells were incubated with mag-fura-2/AM (4 μm) for 150 min at 37 °C in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (25Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The nominally calcium-free buffer consisted of a bicarbonate-free medium containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm d-glucose, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, with an osmolarity of 291. For experiments requiring external Ca2+, 2 mm CaC12 was added to the buffer; for experiments requiring chelation of external Ca2+, 1 mm EGTA was added. After incubation with fura-2/AM, an inspection of the cells by fluorescence microscopy demonstrated no vesicular compartmentalization of fura-2, suggesting that the dye loading method permitted measurement of cytosolic [Ca2+]i. A visual inspection of fura-C18-loaded cells and mag-fura-2-loaded cells showed fluorescent labeling of the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles, respectively. Whole cell and plasma membrane [Ca2+]i measurements were obtained with C·IMAGING Systems Simple PCI software (Compix, Inc., Cranberry, PA), with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, respectively, and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored by the ratios of fura-2 fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm. Immunoblotting—The protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% acrylamide), resolved by electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline solution with 5% milk or BSA to block nonspecific binding sites. Membranes were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. Horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk or BSA. Labeled proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Chamber slides (8-well, Labtek) were coated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml in PBS). Cells were plated for 4-6 h prior to incubation with fibronectin-coated latex microbeads for 30 min at 37 °C. Prior to immunostaining, cells were stimulated with IL-1 (20 ng/ml for 20 min), fixed (3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature), blocked, and permeabilized in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% BSA for 15 min at room temperature. Antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% BSA. Immunofluorescence staining was performed with rabbit anti-SHP-2 antibody (1:50), mouse anti-calnexin (1:50), or rabbit anti-PLCγ1 antibody (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS, incubated with goat anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated antibody or goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody for 1 h, washed, and sealed with coverslips. The slides were viewed with a Nikon 300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with Nomarski optics. Images were captured with a charge-coupled device camera (Imagepoint, Photometrics, Phoenix, AZ). Immunoprecipitation—Cells at 80-90% confluence on 100-mm tissue culture dishes in normal growth medium were treated with IL-1 and washed three times in ice-cold PBS. Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium PPi, 1 mm Na3VO4) was added to each well. The cell lysates were scraped into a microcentrifuge tube and rotated for 20 min at 4 °C. Pansorbin A was used to block nonspecific binding in the lysates (1 h at 4 °C), and after centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The lysates were incubated overnight with 50 μl of agarose-conjugated rabbit polyclonal SHP-2 (5 μl of antibody, 50 μl of agarose beads) at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The pellet of beads was washed three times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Equal amounts of the eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-SHP-2, anti-phospho-SHP-2, anti-PLCγ1, and anti-phospho-PLCγ1 antibodies. Short Interfering RNA—Specific inhibition of SHP-2 was conducted with siRNA (sequence AG-CCCAAAAAGAGUUACAUUGCC-DTT, residues 1080-1100 of the SHP-2 sequence). Human gingival fibroblasts grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 100 nm of SHP-2 siRNA or GFP-siRNA (control) using Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's specifications. Gene silencing was conducted for 72 h. Cells were washed in PBS, lysed with Laemmli buffer, and immunoblotted to assess the efficacy of SHP-2 knockdown. Data Analysis—Means and S.E. were calculated for [Ca2+]i measurements, including the base line [Ca2+]i and the net change of [Ca2+]i above base line. For all continuous variables, means and S.E. were computed, and, when appropriate, comparisons were made between two groups with the unpaired Student's t test or, for multiple samples, with analysis of variance. Post hoc testing was carried out with Tukey's test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. For all experiments, n ≥ 3 independent cultures were used. For calcium measurements, only a single cell in each culture was measured. IL-1-induced Ca2+ Influx and ER Release Occur Locally around Fibronectin-coated Beads—IL-1-induced Ca2+ signals are dependent on focal adhesions in cultured cells (9Lo Y.Y. Luo L. McCulloch C.A. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Wang Q. Downey G.P. Choi C. Kapus A. McCulloch C.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1898-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the spatial relationships between focal adhesions and sites of IL-1-induced Ca2+ transients have not been described. We first determined whether IL-1-induced Ca2+ signaling is restricted to focal adhesion sites. Focal adhesions were induced by applying fibronectin-coated beads to the dorsal surfaces of cells plated on poly-l-lysine (i.e. with no focal adhesions on their ventral surfaces). Cells plated on poly-l-lysine were loaded with fura-2/AM (to measure cytosolic Ca2+), fura-C18 (to measure juxtamembranous Ca2+), or mag-fura-2/AM (to measure ER Ca2+). Cells were then preincubated with fibronectin- or BSA-coated beads (2-μm diameter) and treated with IL-1. Ratios of [Ca2+]i, fura-C18, and mag-fura-2 were measured by ratio imaging for the whole cell in circumscribed 5-μm zones around the periphery of attached beads and in similarly sized, randomly chosen zones within the projected area of the cell but at least 10 μm from the attached beads (Fig. 1, A-C). IL-1 induced localized increases of intracellular Ca2+ (fura-2/AM), Ca2+ transients subjacent to the cell membrane (fura-C18), and Ca2+ release from the ER (mag-fura-2/AM), but these changes were found only when cells were incubated with fibronectin-coated beads and only in the vicinity of fibronectin beads. No significant changes in Ca2+ were detected at sites remote from the beads, and no evidence for IL-1-induced Ca2+ signaling was found in cells plated on poly-l-lysine and incubated with BSA-coated beads. Therefore, as shown previously (10Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Luo L. Cruz T. McCulloch C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), integrin-dependent focal adhesion formation is essential for IL-1-induced Ca2+ signals. The novel aspect of the current observations is that Ca2+ fluxes induced by IL-1 originate from and are strictly localized to the vicinity of focal adhesions. Because there was very tight co-localization of mag-fura-2 Ca2+ signals with fibronectin-coated beads, we asked whether the focal adhesions were co-distributed with the endoplasmic reticulum. Fibronectin or BSA-coated latex beads were added to the dorsal surfaces of cells attached previously to poly-l-lysine to induce focal adhesion assembly at sites of cell-bead contacts. Immunostaining for calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum-specific protein, showed that within 30 min after adding fibronectin or BSA-beads, calnexin accumulated at sites adjacent to the fibronectin beads but not BSA beads (Fig. 1D), indicating that the endoplasmic reticulum is spatially associated with nascent focal adhesions. These experiments confirmed that the localized generation of focal adhesions on rounded cells was sufficient to restore responsiveness to IL-1 without inducing cell spreading (26MacGillivray M.K. Cruz T.F. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23509-23515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and showed that IL-1-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum is spatially associated with nascent focal adhesions. SHP-2 Is Required for IL-1-induced Cytosolic Ca2+ Flux, ER Ca2+ Release, and ERK Activation—A general role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of Ca2+ fluxes has been reported (27Hsu S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15666-15675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and we demonstrated earlier that the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is enriched in the focal adhesions of fibroblasts and can modulate IL-1-induced ERK activation (20MacGillivray M.

Although several protein tyrosine phosphatases, including protein tyrosine phosphatase-α and low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase, are known to associate with focal adhesions (20MacGillivray M.

Importantly, SHP-2 itself undergoes phosphorylation on several key tyrosine residues, including Tyr-580 and Tyr-542, which are modifications that are known to alter its catalytic and adaptor functions (20MacGillivray M. Herrera-Abreu M.T. Chow C.W. Shek C. Wang Q. Vachon E. Feng G.S. Siminovitch K.A. McCulloch C.A. Downey G.P. J. Biol.

We utilized a cell model system that allowed direct analysis of the role of SHP-2 in IL-1-induced Ca2+ fluxes and ERK activation through focal adhesions. SHP-2-/- (Δ46-110, designated here as SHP-2-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts cells express a SHP-2 protein with a deletion of 65 amino acids in the N-terminal SH2 domain (21Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M.

https://openalex.org/W1991824519,"Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans and livestock, expresses at least three cAMP-specific class I phosphodiesterases (PDEs), all of which are essential for survival of the parasite. These PDEs have either one or two N-terminal GAF domains, which in other proteins function as signaling domains. However, neither the functional roles nor ligands for these domains in trypanosome PDEs are known. The present study shows that TbPDE2B, which contains two tandem GAF domains, binds cAMP with high affinity through its GAF-A domain. A purified recombinant N terminus + GAF-A domain binds cAMP with an affinity (Ki) of ∼16 nm. It also binds cGMP but with a 15-fold lower affinity of ∼275 nm. The TbPDE2B holoenzyme has a somewhat lower affinity (∼55 nm) for cAMP but a greatly lower affinity (∼10 μm) for cGMP. This suggests that both the selectivity and affinity for a ligand can be determined not only by the nature of the binding domain but also by the adjacent domains. Additionally, binding of cAMP to the holoenzyme showed positive cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient value of 1.75. However, binding of cGMP to the holoenzyme did not show any cooperativity, suggesting differences in the conformational changes caused by binding of these two cyclic nucleotides with the protein. Point mutation of a key predicted binding site residue (T317A) resulted in a complete loss of high affinity cAMP binding. This mutation increased the apparent Km of the mutant enzyme for substrate without altering the Vmax. A truncated catalytic domain construct of TbPDE2B also exhibited an increased Km, strongly suggesting that cAMP binding to the GAF-A domain can regulate TbPDE2B by allowing the full activity of the enzyme to be expressed. These properties of the GAF-A domain of TbPDE2B thus suggest that it could be a new target for anti-trypanosomal drugs.

In higher eukaryotes, PDEs are known to regulate a variety of processes including visual transduction, olfaction, control of metabolic activities, insulin secretion, fertility, and a host of other functions. The precise cellular profile of PDE expression is thought to influence the response of a tissue or organism to cyclic nucleotides.In mammals, there are 11 distinct Class I PDE families (1Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Soderling S.H. Beavo J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) that have conserved catalytic domains but different regulatory domains. These 11 mammalian PDE family members each have different kinetic and substrate characteristics, inhibitor profiles, amino acid sequences, and regulatory ligands (3Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Other organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae have a second class of phosphodiesterases, termed Class II PDEs, that have a different evolutionary origin and catalytic domains that are not homologous to mammalian PDEs (4Nikawa J. Sass P. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Five of the 11 mammalian Class I PDE family members contain regulatory segments with one or two tandem GAF domains (5Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). GAF domains are a very large family of small molecule-binding domains recently found to be present in nearly all organisms (5Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Thus far, the only high affinity ligand identified for a PDE GAF domain has been cGMP. Binding of cGMP to the GAF domains of PDE5 (6Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and PDE2 (7Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is an important mechanism for regulating these enzymes. cGMP also tightly binds the photoreceptor PDE6 (8Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), where its precise role is being investigated (9Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, cAMP was found to bind and activate the GAF domain of the cyaB1 adenylyl cyclase from the cyanobacterium Anabaena genus (10Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Significant insights into the mechanism of cyclic nucleotide binding to these GAF domains was provided by the recent structure determination of the murine PDE2A regulatory GAF domains in complex with cGMP (11Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A follow-up study also revealed a number of critical contacts enabling nucleotide binding and subtle discrimination between cAMP and cGMP (12Wu A.Y. Tang X.B. Martinez S.E. Ikeda K. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37928-37938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two recent reviews discuss the evolutionary conservation, properties, and possible functions of these GAF domains in cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and other proteins (13Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Martinez S.E. Beavo J.A. Hol W.G. Mol. Intervent. 2002; 2: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).In parasites of the Trypanosomatidae family, cAMP is an important mediator of cell transformation and proliferation. Intracellular levels of cAMP are known to vary during different life cycle stages of trypanosomes (15Strickler J.E. Patton C.L. Science. 1975; 190: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, a densitysensing mechanism that signals cell cycle arrest in trypanosomes and leads to differentiation appears to be via the cAMP pathway (16Vassella E. Reuner B. Yutzy B. Boshart M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2661-2671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise roles of PDEs in these parasites are still largely unexplored (17Naula C. Seebeck T. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 35-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, it is known that the differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei from bloodstream forms to short, stumpy forms can be inhibited by non-selective PDE inhibitors (18Reed S.L. Fierer A.S. Goddard D.R. Colmerauer M.E. Davis C.E. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 844-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating the importance of PDEs in these organisms. Recently, three different Class I cAMP-specific PDEs, TbPDE2A, -B, and -C, were identified in T. brucei (19Zoraghi R. Kunz S. Gong K. Seebeck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11559-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Rascon A. Soderling S.H. Schaefer J.B. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All three were found to be essential for proliferation of the bloodstream form of T. brucei (21Zoraghi R. Seebeck T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4343-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These three also contained either one or two tandem GAF domains (19Zoraghi R. Kunz S. Gong K. Seebeck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11559-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Rascon A. Soderling S.H. Schaefer J.B. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TbPDE2B intriguingly did not appear to bind cGMP (19Zoraghi R. Kunz S. Gong K. Seebeck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11559-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Rascon A. Soderling S.H. Schaefer J.B. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neither a guanylyl cyclase nor a function for cGMP has yet been identified in trypanosomes. Considering the challenges being faced in present chemotherapy for human sleeping sickness (22Keiser J. Stich A. Burri C. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 42-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the established success of PDE inhibitors as drugs in various human diseases, TbPDE2A, -B, and -C are attractive antitrypanosomal drug targets. This provides much incentive for understanding their regulation and the function of their GAF domains. The current study reports high affinity cAMP binding to the TbPDE2B GAF-A domain, characterizes the binding, and provides data that suggest this cAMP binding is important for regulation of the trypanosome PDE activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[5,8-3H]cAMP and [8-3H]cGMP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. cAMP and cGMP (sodium salts), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were obtained from Sigma. Protein G-agarose beads were from Oncogene Research Products/Calbiochem.Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 or 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in Grace's insect cell medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.TbPDE2B Constructs—TbPDE2B holoenzyme in a pFastbac vector (21Zoraghi R. Seebeck T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4343-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used as the template in all PCRs. TbPDE2B holoenzyme was PCR-amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using primers 5′-CATATGACACACAACGGTGGTCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGAGTACTGCTGTTGTTGCCAGAACT-3′. TbPDE2B N terminus + GAF-A domain was amplified using primers 5′-CATATGACACACAACGGTGGTCGT-3′ and 5′-ATCGAGAATCACGTCACTCTTTTT-3′, ending at amino acid Asp-395. The catalytic domain was amplified using primers 5′-CCACAAAAGTTTGGTTGCTCTGACGAG-3′ and 5′-ACGAGTACTGCTGTTGTTGCCAGAACT-3′, starting at Pro-642 and to the end. All fragments were cloned into pcDNA3.1-V5his (Invitrogen). In addition, the N terminus + GAF-A domain was amplified using primers 5′-CATATGACACACAACGGTGGTCGT-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAATCGAGAATCGAGAATCACGTCACTCTT-3′ (from start to Asp-395) and inserted into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and NotI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET28a (Novagen) to make an N-terminal His6-tagged construct. TbPDE2B was also cloned into pAcGHLT-A (Pharmingen) for subsequent construction of a baculovirus expression vector system for expression in insect cells. Primers 5′-CCGGAATTCATGACACACAACGGTGGTCGT-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCTCAACGAGTACTGCTGTTGTTGCCAG-3′ containing the restriction sites for EcoRI and NotI were used to amplify the holoenzyme, TOPO, cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and digested with EcoRI and NotI. The TbPDE2B fragment was then gel-purified and then ligated into pAcGHLT-A. All constructs were subsequently sequenced.Expression and Purification of Bacterially Expressed Protein—The N terminus + GAF-A domains were expressed in Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) cells grown in Luria broth with 75 μg/ml carbenicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C up to an A600 of 0.4-0.6, induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested after 22 h of growth at 16 °C. The cells were resuspended and lysed in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) plus 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) by microfluidization (10,000 p.s.i.) (Microfluidics, Newton, MA), and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was purified using a TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) and eluted with lysis buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The imidazole was removed using a PD10 buffer exchange column, replacing it with the original lysis buffer.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The T317A point mutant was made using holoenzyme TbPDE2B pcDNA3.1V5his as the template. The mutation was made using the QuikChange protocol from Stratagene, with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene). All plasmids subjected to mutagenesis and subcloning were sequenced to ensure the presence of the desired mutation. Primers 5′-GCTACTGGGTACCGTGCAAAGACGATACTCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGAGTATCGTCTTTGCACGGTACCCAGTAGC-3′ were used.Transient Transfection of HEK293T Cells—Plasmids with the TbPDE2B constructs subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-V5-his vector (Invitrogen) were purified using a Qiagen plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen). Cells plated on 100-mm plates were transiently transfected with DNA using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein expression was verified by Western blot analysis of cell lysates using an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested for experiments after 40-48 h of growth, washed in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (Invitrogen) and resuspended in homogenization buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were lysed using a Virsonic 100 sonicator for 4-5 s and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for all further assays.Construction of a Baculovirus Expression Vector System for TbPDE2B Expression in Sf9 Cells and Purification—Recombinant TbPDE2B holoenzyme-expressing Baculoviruses were constructed using Baculogold DNA (Pharmingen) co-transfecting Baculogold DNA with the TbPDE2B-pAcGHLT-A vector into Sf9 cells using the manufacturer's transfection set and the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmingen/BD Biosciences). After 5 days, the supernatants from the experimental co-transfection plates were collected, and co-transfection efficiencies were estimated using end point dilution assays. The virus was amplified twice to generate high titer stock, and the viral titer was determined by plaque assays. Sf9 cells were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of infection = 3. Maximum protein expression was seen after 3 days, when the cells were harvested. The cells were resuspended and lysed in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) plus 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) by microfluidization (10,000 p.s.i.) (Microfluidics) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was subsequently purified on a glutathione uniflow resin (BD Biosciences) column (using the glutathione S-transferase epitope tag on TbPDE2B), and TbPDE2B was eluted using 10 mm reduced glutathione in the same buffer. The protein exhibited normal wild-type enzymatic activity and was stored at -20 °C for at least 3 weeks without any significant loss of activity.Immunoprecipitation—Transfected and control (untransfected) cell supernatants were first cleared by incubation with 15 μl of protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 45 min (with gentle mixing). These extracts were subsequently centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatants transferred to different tubes. Cleared supernatants were incubated with the anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 2-3 h in a volume of 1 ml (with gentle mixing). After three washes in homogenization buffer, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in homogenization or binding buffer or prepared in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE resolution and Western blot analysis.Western Blot Analysis—Samples were diluted 1:1 in a 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol), boiled at 100 °C for 5-10 min, and then applied to a 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostained with anti-V5 antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected by ECL using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgGs and a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).cNMP Competition Binding Assays and IC50 Curves—To determine an IC50 value for cAMP or cGMP displacement of 3[H]cAMP from the purified N terminus + GAF-A domain, binding assays were conducted in a total volume of 10 ml of binding buffer. Ten pmol of [3H]cAMP (1 nm) and ∼6 pmol of purified bacterial N terminus + GAF-A protein (0.6 nm protein) were used/assay point, with increasing concentrations of cold cNMP (as indicated). The large 10-ml volume was used to keep the absolute concentrations of [3H]cNMP sufficiently low (because binding affinities for cAMP were ∼16 nm), therefore retaining sufficient counts. Following an incubation of 20-30 min on ice, ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of either 1 or 3 m (as described under “Results”). For cNMP binding to the holoenzyme, the assay was done in a concentration of 1 ml of binding buffer (10 nm radioligand, 6 nm protein). These conditions for the assay were selected keeping in mind the assumptions and possible ambiguities of competitive binding curves, as described by Motulsky and Christopoulos (23Motulsky H. Christopoulos A. Fitting Models to Biological Data Using Linear and Non-linear Regression, A Practical Guide to Curve Fitting. Oxford University Press, London2004Google Scholar) (i.e.”.. .if the concentration of labeled ligand greatly exceeds the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd or Ki), the curve is ambiguous, as an infinite number of curves defined by different Kd values are almost identical...”). Hence, care was taken to ensure that the [3H]cAMP concentration was well below the Kd, that the protein concentration was less than the [3H]cAMP concentration, and that there were sufficient total counts to measure accurately. Therefore, under the conditions of assay, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Ki) obtained from the IC50 values (using the Cheng and Prusoff equation (24Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12179) Google Scholar)) closely reflected the IC50 value itself. More detailed explanations are available in the online manuals on the Prism website resource library (www.graphpad.com). The solution was filtered onto a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore), washed twice with the ammonium sulfate solution, dissolved in scintillation fluid (Filter-Count/PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the counts bound measured in a scintillation counter. Non-linear regression analysis of the data was done using Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to obtain the IC50 and Ki values and was presented as the mean ± S.D. from four independent experiments. To obtain Hill coefficients, the binding data were re-expressed as a percentage of [3H]cAMP displaced by unlabeled ligand (100% binding or 0% displaced with no cold ligand present) and analyzed using a sigmoidal dose response curve in Prism, with a variable slope equation, from which the Hill slope was obtained.Determination of Binding Equilibrium—To determine the time necessary for cNMP binding to reach equilibrium (for both the purified holoenzyme as well as the N terminus + GAF-A construct), binding assays were done as described earlier with 10 nm [3H]cAMP and 6 nm purified protein. The samples were filtered onto the nitrocellulose membrane after 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 180 min. Subsequent wash, binding, and detection procedures were as described above.Phosphodiesterase Assay—PDE assays were carried out using the method of Hansen et al. (25Hansen R.S. Charbonneau H. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2788-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).C. H. Assays were performed using transfected cell supernatants for 10 min at 30 °C with 0.1-100 μm cAMP as substrate and 15 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (to inhibit non-trypanosomatid PDEs in the cell supernatants). Assays were initiated by adding protein to the substrate-buffer mix. The reaction volume was 250 μl (40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 2.0 mm EGTA, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100,000 cycles/min of [3H]cAMP). TbPDE2B was diluted to produce <30% total cAMP hydrolysis at any given substrate concentration. Calculations were done using Microsoft Excel and plotted in Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and presented as the average of at least three experiments. Km and apparent Vmax values were obtained from Prism by analyzing the data using the Michaelis-Menten equation in the program.Homology Modeling—A homology model of the TbPDE2B GAF-A domain was constructed using Swiss-Model (26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9463) Google Scholar, 27Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of the mmPDE2B GAF-B domain (1MC0.pdb) using a ClustalW (biology workbench) alignment of TbPDE2B GAF-A on mmPDE2B GAF-B as a template. Images were generated using the Swiss Protein Data Bank viewer and further refined using Pov-Ray.Other Methods—Total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as the standard. Protein levels in Western blots (with an anti-V5 antibody) were normalized using ImageJ (NIH) to measure the relative densities of the detected bands.RESULTSTbPDE2B Binds cAMP through Its GAF-A Domain— HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with a full-length native (wt) TbPDE2B expression plasmid or a TbPDE2B catalytic domain fragment plasmid. Both contained a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (Fig. 1A) allowing immunoprecipitation of the expressed protein using an anti-V5 antibody. Given the high sequence identity of TbPDE2B to mammalian PDE2A, especially within the GAF-A domain, it seemed likely that the TbPDE2B GAF-A domain should bind cyclic nucleotides. However, an earlier study (20Rascon A. Soderling S.H. Schaefer J.B. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4714-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) had not been able to detect cGMP binding. Yet this did not rule out binding of cAMP, which is an important signaling molecule in trypanosomids, nor was the binding to cGMP quantitatively determined in the previous study. To test this possibility, a Millipore filter-binding assay was carried out with [3H]cAMP and immunoprecipitated proteins from control (untransfected), catalytic domain, or TbPDE2B holoenzyme transfected cells. This was done in the presence of at least 5 mm EDTA (which inhibits enzymatic activity by chelating the Mg2+ ion required for hydrolysis) due to the absence of other effective inhibitors for this cAMP-specific PDE. [3H]cAMP bound to immunoprecipitated TbPDE2B but not to immunoprecipitates of control lysates or the catalytic domain alone, ruling out the possibility that the radioactivity detected was because of cAMP binding to the catalytic domain (Fig. 1B).Given the primary amino acid sequence similarity of the TbPDE2B GAF-A to the PDE2A GAF-B domain (19Zoraghi R. Kunz S. Gong K. Seebeck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11559-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as well as the CyaB1 GAF domain of the Anabaena cyclase, the GAF-A domain seemed to be the region most likely to bind cAMP. To test this hypothesis, the N terminus + GAF-A region (Fig. 1A) was cloned, expressed in HEK293T cells, and used in binding studies. The immunoprecipitated protein clearly bound cAMP (Fig. 1B). Cell supernatants of all three expressed proteins were stable and showed no significant visible degradation (as detected by Western blot analysis), even after 3 days of storage at 4 °C. For quantification of relative levels of expression, the expressed wt TbPDE2B, catalytic domain fragment and the N terminus + GAF-A fragment were visualized by Western analysis and the relative intensities measured by densitometry (Fig. 1C). It was not possible to determine the binding capacity, if any, of TbPDE2B GAF-B, because recombinant GAF-B in bacteria was insoluble. Similarly, constructs expressing either GAF-B or the GAF-B + catalytic domain in HEK293 cells were unstable and appeared to be degraded immediately upon lysis (data not shown).cAMP Binds to Recombinant N terminus + GAF-A Domain with Nanomolar Affinity—To obtain enough purified protein to easily determine the binding affinity of cAMP to the GAF-A domain, the N terminus + GAF-A domain was cloned into pET28a (Fig. 1A) and expressed in RosettaDE3 Escherichia coli cells. Protein from the high speed supernatant fraction of the cell lysate was affinity-purified on a TALON affinity resin (Fig. 2A) and immediately desalted on a PD10 column. Purified protein was then used in [3H]cAMP competition binding assays to obtain an IC50 value, with increasing concentrations of cold cAMP as the competitive ligand. The IC50 values for cAMP displacing [3H]cAMP were obtained by analyzing the competitive binding data by non-linear regression and fitting it to a one-site competition equation using Prism software. The actual affinities (Ki values) were calculated as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” 2The IC50 of a ligand for a receptor depends on three factors: the affinity of the receptor for the competing drug (defined by the equilibrium dissociation constant Ki), the concentration of the radioligand, andthe affinity of the radioligand for the receptor (Kd). The affinity of the ligand (cNMP) can thus be calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (24Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12179) Google Scholar), which states that the equilibrium dissociation constant of the ligand Ki = IC50/(1 + [Radioligand]/Kd). In the case of [3H]cAMP being displaced by cAMP, the equation further simplifies to Ki = IC50 - [Radioligand], because Ki = Kd. This value of Kd for [3H]cAMP may then be used to determine the Ki for cGMP binding. Binding of cAMP to the GAF-A domain was found to be of high affinity, with an IC50 value of 17.6 ± 1.8 nm (Fig. 2B). This high affinity cAMP binding is similar to that seen for cGMP binding to the mammalian PDEs 2, 5, and 6.Fig. 2Recombinant N terminus + GAF-A domain of TbPDE2B binds cAMP with nanomolar affinity, whereas cGMP has lower affinity for this domain.

In this study, functional data demonstrate that members of the three p160 families can have opposing roles in regulating gene expression by the same transcription factor. Both SRC1A and p/CIP function as coactivators for MyoD-mediated transcription whereas GRIP1 acts negatively as a (co)repressor. SRC1A and p/CIP predominantly interact with distinct sites on the NH2-terminal activation domain of MyoD. GRIP1 binds to both these regions but it alone, and neither SRC1A nor p/CIP, also interacts with specific sites on MyoD that are critical for the binding of the essential MyoD coactivator, p300. This suggests that competition by GRIP1 for SRC1A, p/CIP, and p300 binding sites on a transcription factor may regulate the activity of the factor. p160 coregulators were initially identified as nuclear hormone receptor coactivators.

Because of these shared characteristics of MyoD-mediated transactivation and the known mechanisms of p160 coactivation we inferred that the p160 proteins might well act as myogenic coregulators through direct interactions with MyoD transcriptional complexes. Here we present functional data showing that representatives of each of the three classes of p160s do not always act in concert but can have opposing roles in regulating gene expression by the same transcription factor. Whereas both SRC1A and p/CIP indeed function as coactivators for MyoD-mediated transcription, GRIP1 surprisingly acts in an opposite manner and serves as a (co)repressor, the first example of such negative activity. We identified the domains of MyoD that are essential for physically and functionally interacting with each of the p160 proteins. SRC1A and p/CIP predominantly interact with distinct sites on the NH2-terminal activation domain of MyoD. GRIP1 binds to both these regions, but it alone, and neither SRC1A nor p/CIP, also interacts with specific sites on MyoD that are critical for the binding of the essential MyoD coactivator, p300. This suggests that competition by GRIP1 for SRC1A, p/CIP, and p300 binding sites on a transcription factor might regulate the activity of the factor.

Evans, Salk Institute) or pCMX-LexA, respectively. pCMX-LexA was made by substituting the Gal4 DNA binding domain of pCMX-Gal4N with the LexA DNA binding domain of pEG202 (a gift from E. Golemis, Fox Chase Cancer Center). L8G5LUC was generously provided by S. Hollenberg (Volum Institute). G4TATALUC was made by cleaving out a 17-mer-TATA fragment from a 17-TATA poly(A) vector (generous gift of Ming-Jer Tsai, Baylor) and subcloning it into pGL2-Basic. GST-MyoD was originally provided by H. Weintraub (Hutchinson Cancer Institute). pCMXVP16MyoD was made by subcloning PCR amplified MyoD fragment into pCMXVP16 (a gift from R. Evans, Salk Institute). Various deletions as well as site-specific mutants of GST-MyoD were created by subcloning different PCR amplified DNA fragments into pGEX2TK. Each set of deletion mutants of GRIP1, SRC1A, p/CIP, as well as Gal4DBD fusion constructs were made by subcloning various PCR amplified DNA fragments into either pSG5, pCDNA3, or pCMX-Gal4N expression vectors. The nucleotide sequences of all the mutants have been determined at least for the critical regions subjected to changes. All the expression vectors, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, were tested for production of a protein of the expected molecular size determined either by Coomassie Blue staining for bacterially produced proteins or in vitro translation for proteins expressed in mammalian cells. Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Reporter Assays—Mouse C3H10T1/2 embryo fibroblasts obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% fetal bovine serum, heat-inactivated). Transient transfections were carried out by the BES-buffered saline method as described (26Hamamori Y. Wu H.Y. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6563-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). When cells reached ∼40–60% confluence, plasmid DNA (total of 9 μg per 60 mm-diameter dish) was added as a calcium phosphate precipitate. The medium was replenished 16–20 h later. Luciferase assays were carried out after an additional 48 h of incubation for the transfected 10T1/2 cells following the manufacturer's protocol. All luciferase assays were done either in duplicate or triplicate with each of two to three independent plasmid preparations. All results were normalized to total protein in cell lysates. Both SRC1A+/+ and SRC1A–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (31Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) and β-mercaptoethanol (10–4 m). MEFs were refed with fresh medium without 2-mercaptoethanol when transient transfections were carried out. To measure the transcription activity of MyoD in SRC1A–/– MEFs, 4RELUC, MCKLUC, or HCALUC (1 μg each) reporter, plus pCDNA3MyoD expression vectors (amounts as shown in the figures), were cotransfected into the MEFs. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—In vitro transcription-translation was carried out using 1 μg of various supercoiled DNA plasmids, TNT® coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), and l-[35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression and purification of various glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins as well as protein-protein interaction assays were performed as described previously (26Hamamori Y. Wu H.Y. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6563-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) and purified using glutathione-agarose affinity matrix (Sigma). The molecular weight of each individual purified protein was analyzed and confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Normalized amounts of agarose-bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled translation products in NETN binding buffer (Nonidet P-40, 0.5%; EDTA, 1 mm; Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 8.0; NaCl, 100 mm; ethidium bromide, 12.5 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with iced NETN, and the bound proteins were released by incubating at 95°C for 3 min. The released proteins were then analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were then fixed (H2O, 50%; methanol, 40%; acetic acid, 10%; 20 min), treated with Enlightning™ (DuPont, 20 min), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. GRIP1 Represses MyoD on Muscle-specific Promoters—We first investigated the effects of p160s on MyoD dependent transcription using muscle-specific promoters fused to a reporter gene. 4RELUC contains four tandem E-box motifs and is activated only by MyoD family members but not other myogenic activators. MCKLUC and HCALUC carry the muscle specific regulatory enhancers of the muscle creatine kinase gene and the human cardiac α-actin gene, respectively. Mouse CH310T1/2 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with one of the reporters plus an expression vector for MyoD and for a p160 protein (Fig. 1). As expected, MyoD alone specifically activates all three promoters (Fig. 1, A–C). Importantly, both SRC1A and CIP were capable of potentiating MyoD transactivation on all three promoters, establishing them as coactivators of MyoD. Very surprisingly, however, GRIP1 not only failed to increase MyoD-mediated induction of reporter activity but repressed it strongly on all three promoters (and nearly completely on the 4RELUC and MCKLUC promoters). Similar effects on MyoD-dependent transcription by p160s also occurs in C2C12 myoblasts and in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. 2H.-Y. Wu, Y. Hamamori, T. Saluna, and L. Kedes, manuscript in preparation. These results strongly imply that SRC1A and p/CIP function in myogenic cells as positive regulators for MyoD, whereas GRIP1 acts negatively in both myogenically undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Furthermore, that these effects are seen using the 4RELUC reporter supports the notion that the effects are mediated through direct interactions with MyoD and not secondarily through effects on other myogenic transcription factors. The Transactivation Activity of MyoD Is Diminished In SRC1A–/– Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—We used SRC1A–/– MEFs derived from the SRC1A–/– mice to test whether SRC1A is essential for MyoD transactivation of muscle-specific promoters. We compared the ability of MyoD to transactivate the target reporters in wild type versus SRC1A–/– MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2, the MyoD-dependent reporter activity was many fold less on the 4RE promoter (Fig. 2A), the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter (Fig. 2B), and on the human cardiac α-actin (HCA) promoter (Fig. 2C) in the SRC1A–/– MEFs. Indeed, the activation of the muscle creatine kinase promoter mediated by MyoD was completely silenced in the SRC1A–/– MEFs (Fig. 2B). These data demonstrated that the ability of MyoD to transactivate is significantly diminished in the absence of SRC1A and that SRC1A is essential for certain types of muscle specific gene expression. NH2 Terminus of MyoD Is Targeted by p160 Coregulators in Vitro—We tested the ability of MyoD protein to interact in vitro with all three classes of p160s using GST-affinity binding assays (Fig. 3B). In vitro translated 35S-labeled GRIP1 (lane 1), SRC1A (lane 4), and p/CIP proteins (lane 7) all bind to GST-MyoD significantly when compared with GST alone (lanes 2, 5, and 8). These data establish that the three classes of p160 coregulators can bind directly to MyoD in vitro. The NH2 terminus of MyoD functions as an activating domain (33Weintraub H. Dwarki V.J. Verma I. Davis R. Hollenberg S. Snider L. Lassar A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and its bHLH domain is essential for both heterodimerizing with E proteins (34Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and DNA binding (35Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar, 36Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). These domains, or MyoD deleted for these domains, were cloned into GST fusion vectors (Fig. 3A). GST affinity assays reveal that the NH2-terminal domain of MyoD is both required and sufficient to interact fully with any of the three p160 coregulators and with p300 (Fig. 3, C and D), whereas deletion of the MyoD bHLH domain does not significantly effect its ability to bind (Fig. 3E). However, when tested alone (Fig. 3F), the bHLH domain retained minimal ability to interact with p/CIP greater than the binding to GST alone. On the other hand, the COOH terminus of MyoD does not appear to be involved in interactions with p300 or with SRC1A and GRIP1 although p/CIP may require it for full binding activity to some extent (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these data suggest that the NH2 terminus of MyoD is the segment of MyoD that primarily interacts with the p160 coregulators and with p300. p160 Coregulators Associate with MyoD in Vivo—Mammalian two-hybrid assays were used next to determone whether these in vitro interactions between p160 coregulators and MyoD also can occur in cells. Full-length GRIP1 and p/CIP were fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain to generate GALGRIP1 and GALCIP; SRC1A was fused to the LexA-DNA binding domain to generate LexASRC1A. These constructs were individually tested for their ability to effect the transcriptional activity of VP16MyoD. As reported previously (37Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 38Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12101-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), GALGRIP1, LexASRC1A, and GALCIP can themselves contribute substantially to reporter activity (column 2 of Fig. 4, A–C). Significantly, all reporter activities were increased in a dose dependent manner when cotransfected with VP16MyoD (columns 3–5 of Fig. 4, A–C). The results of these mammalian two-hybrid experiments establish that all three classes of p160 coregulators can directly associate with MyoD in living cells. SRC1A and CIP Deleted of Analogous Domains Fail to Coactivate MyoD, whereas GRIP1 with the Same Deletion Up-regulates MyoD—We recently identified specific segments of each of the p160s that interact with MyoD both in vitro and in vivo (32Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34359-34364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two separated short domains in the middle of each p160 (designated as MID1 and MID2) as well as the C termini appear to be crucial MyoD interaction domains. We have synthesized in vitro and in vivo the proteins encoded by mutant constructs that lack these elements (designated as Δ(MID1/2+C). Significantly all these mutant proteins lose the ability to interact with MyoD both in vitro and vivo (32Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34359-34364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have now tested these constructs to determine whether the essential interaction domains also play functional roles in regulating the effects of the p160s on MyoD-mediated transcription. Indeed, the mutant constructs all lose their effects on MyoD-mediated expression (Fig. 5, A–C). SRC1A and p/CIP Δ(MID1/2+C) mutants totally lose their ability to augment MyoD-mediated expression on the 4RE, MCK, and HCA reporter constructs (Fig. 5, A and B). Most notably, the GRIP1 mutant loses its suppressive effects and is associated with an intriguing increase in the transcriptional activity of MyoD (Fig. 5C). Thus the functional effects of the p160 coregulators on MyoD mediated transcription, as well as their protein-protein interactions with MyoD, requires the presence of a combination of the MID1, MID2, and COOH-terminal segments. This is consistent with the idea that these functional effects, whether activating or suppressing gene expression, require direct p160-MyoD physical interaction. p300 and the p160 Coregulators Bind to Different Subdomains of the MyoD Amino Terminus—The NH2 terminus domain of MyoD is activated by the binding there of p300/CBP (26Hamamori Y. Wu H.Y. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6563-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) involving an FYD motif and phenylalanine 42. When these sites are mutated, the NH2 terminus loses its ability to transactivate or to bind and be coactivated by p300 (26Hamamori Y. Wu H.Y. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6563-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We speculated that the differential effects of the p160s on MyoD activity might be related to their distinctive contacts with the activation domain and with the p300/CBP binding sites. To begin to test this possibility, we evaluated the GST binding affinity of p300 and of the p160s for three subsegments (and their deletions) of the MyoD NH2-terminal region designated in Fig. 6A as N1 (aa 1–36), N2 (aa 37–72), and N3 (aa 73–109). We tested as well a MyoD NH2 terminus bearing a mutation (F–P) at the critical residue 42. Consistent with previous results (26Hamamori Y. Wu H.Y. Sartorelli V. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6563-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) it appears that both the N3 and N2 regions, including wild type residue 42, are involved in full binding of p300 to the MyoD activation domain (Fig. 6B). As shown in Fig. 6, C–E, the N1 subsegment of MyoD is neither required nor capable of interacting with GRIP1, SRC1A, or p/CIP. The N2 region binds to GRIP1 and SRC1A but not p/CIP. The N3 subsegment appears to interact with both GRIP1 and p/CIP but not SRC1A. Also of importance is the discovery that whereas binding of SRC1A and p/CIP are unaffected by mutation of MyoD at residue 42, both p300 and GRIP1 binding is reduced (lane 7 in Fig. 6, B–E). These results suggest that SRC1A and p/CIP each interact with two different amino acid subsets of the NH2-terminal activation domain of MyoD. The binding targets of GRIP1 could well overlap those of both SRC1A and p/CIP. The functional repression of MyoD activated transcription by GRIP1 stands in stark contrast to the coactivation properties of p300, p/CIP, and SRC1A. That GRIP1, the (co)repressor, binds to the activation domain of MyoD at regions that fully overlap those required for binding by the coactivators p300, SRC1A, and p/CIP has not escaped our attention. Whereas the precise mechanisms of these effects remain to be established, it is attractive to speculate that SRC1A and p/CIP can positively effect the simultaneous interactions of the MyoD activation domain with p300 and pCAF. Conversely, the overlap of the GRIP1 binding sites on MyoD with those of p300, SRC1A, and p/CIP suggest that an interference mechanism may explain the repression effects of GRIP1. The HAT Domain of SRC1A Is Required to Coactivate MyoD—A histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity has been demonstrated in both SRC1A and ACTR (human homologue of p/CIP) (18Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 25Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). It is also known that the HAT domain of pCAF is required to coactivate MyoD-dependent transcription (27Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We tested whether this HAT activity of SRC1A was essential for its coactivation of MyoD-activated transcription. The full HAT activity of SRC1A has been located at its COOH terminus (aa 1107–1441) (25Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Thus, SRC1AΔC, a mutant devoid of its COOH terminus (aa 1105–1441), was initially employed to test this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 7A, it appeared that the coactivation ability of the SRC1A mutant devoid of its HAT domain (lanes 6–8) is greatly diminished compared with wild type SRC1A (lanes 3–5). The importance of the HAT domain was further confirmed by testing its effect on MyoD-mediated transcription. We cotransfected a segment of SRC1A (encoding amino acids 1028–1441) carrying both the MID2 region and the HAT COOH-terminal domain. This segment potentiated transcription from the MyoD activated MCK promoter. (Fig. 7B, lane 5 and 6). The HAT domain of SRC1A thus appears to be required for MyoD-dependent transcription since it is embedded in the MID2+COOH-terminal domain tested above. Our examination of the effects of p160 proteins not only demonstrates their functions in modulating MyoD-dependent muscle specific gene expression but reveals their independent and different roles in regulating the same transcriptional activator, MyoD. We found that SRC1A and p/CIP are capable of potentiating MyoD transactivation in C3H10T1/2 cells. We observed increases by SRC1A of up to 9-fold and 4-fold by p/CIP using the natural HCA promoter in pluripotent 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, we concluded that both SRC1A and p/CIP function as coactivators for MyoD-dependent transcription, activities completely consistent with their known positive effects on other transcription factors. In marked contrast, GRIP1, which has been extensively characterized as a coactivator of ligand-mediated nuclear hormone receptor-dependent transcription, significantly down-regulates MyoD-reporter activity on both 4RE and MCK promoters. It does this not only in 10T1/2 cells but in differentiating myoblasts as well (32Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34359-34364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by at least 80–100% when compared with MyoD tested alone. The extent of such negative regulation is less extreme on the HCA promoter, but it reduces MyoD transactivation by 40–50%. This appears to be the first report in which any p160 protein acts as a repressor of a transcription factor. Our observations are operationally quite different from the one reported instance in which a p160 protein was discovered to repress transcription (39Rogatsky I. Zarember K.A. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6071-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In that paper it was shown that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) repressed transcription of the collagenase promoter (col3A) and that GRIP1, binding to the GR, further suppressed transcription. Thus GRIP1, by increasing the already negative activity of GR, was acting to enhance GR activity. In the case of the transcriptional activator MyoD, GRIP1 works to oppose its activity. Chen et al. (40Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have analyzed extensively the effects of GRIP1 on transcription mediated by the other major class of myogenic transactivators, MEF2. When transcription is dependent on the presence of MEF2, GRIP1 strongly enhances transcription from many of the same promoters we have tested (40Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEF2 contributes to E-box-dependent transcription by binding to MyoD and helping tether other coactivators including p300/CBP and, as shown by Chen et al. (40Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GRIP1. Indeed, among the experimental paradigms tested by Chen et al. (40Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E.

However, a review of their data indeed shows that in the absence of MEF2 GRIP1 suppresses transcription mediated by MyoD family members on both the MCK promoter and on the artificial E-box promoter, 4RE. MyoD transactivation is significantly decreased on both 4RE and HCA promoters in SRC1A–/– MEFs, suggesting that SRC1A is required for full MyoD transactivation (Fig. 2, A and C). The transactivation activity of both GALMyoD (full-length of MyoD fused to Gal-DBD, 4-fold decreased) and GALMyoD-N (NH2-terminal activation domain of MyoD fused to Gal-DBD, 2-fold decreased) was also decreased using a G4TATALUC reporter in SRC1A–/– MEFs when compared with wild type MEFs (data not shown). In addition, SRC1A appears to be essential for MyoD transactivation activity on the MCK promoter in SRC1A–/– MEFs (Fig. 2B). The mechanisms by which MyoD acts differently on various muscle specific promoters in SRC1A–/– MEFs still remains to be investigated. MyoD is active only when it is acetylated (27Puri P.L.

However, it is the HAT activity of pCAF but not that of p300/CBP that is required to coactivate MyoD-dependent transcription (27Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H.

Given that 1) the in vitro interactions between MyoD and pCAF are much weaker than between MyoD and p300 and 2) there is no detectable interaction between pCAF and MyoD in mammalian two-hybrid assays, it seems likely that the role of pCAF in MyoD-activated transcription must be mediated by other associated factors. To date it has been concluded that p300/CBP plays that role (27Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We have shown here that in addition to p300/CBP, all p160 coregulators are able to associate with MyoD in vivo (Fig. 4). Thus, it is possible that two p160s, SRC1A and p/CIP, and p300/CBP, either together or individually, may stablize the interactions required to complex pCAF and its acetylation activity with MyoD. Further support for this notion is provided by the observation that E1A, a direct inhibitor of myogenesis and MyoD-dependent gene transcription targets p160s. 3H-Y. Wu, unpublished data. The important role of p160 in the function of such myogenic coactivator complexes is underscored by our discovery of the direct physical interactions between p160 coregulators and MyoD in vitro (Fig. 3). Importantly, these physical interactions between p160s and MyoD are able to take place independently of both E2A gene products, the heterodimer partners of myogenic bHLH proteins, and MEF2, since they are not necessarily included in the in vitro GST binding reactions. The activation domains of transcription factors are the binding targets of co-activating adaptor proteins such as p300/CBP. SRC1A and p/CIP coactivators follow this rule, since they bind to the NH2-terminal activation domain of MyoD (Fig. 3, C and D). p300, SRC1A, and p/CIP all coactivate MyoD-dependent transcription through interactions at the same NH2-terminal activation domain of MyoD. This raises the question of whether their binding is coordinated and cooperative or whether their binding activities and docking sites are mutually interchangeable. Our experiments suggest that each has its individual binding positions on the NH2 terminus of MyoD (Fig. 6). Thus, it is likely that these molecules interact and regulate MyoD transactivation in a coordinated manner rather than competing for binding. GRIP1 appears to be an exception since it binds throughout the NH2 terminus (Fig. 6C). This suggests that it could compete for binding by the coactivators thus providing a logical and testable explanation for the (co)repressor activity of GRIP1 on MyoD-mediated transcription. MyoD protein must be acetylated to function as a transcriptional activator. The HAT domains of both p300 and PCAF are capable of acetylating MyoD. However, only the HAT domain of PCAF, which binds to the MyoD transcription complex mostly through its affinity for p300, is essential (27Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V.

Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). SRC1A and pCIP contain HAT domains (25Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and the HAT activities of these domains might possibly play a positive regulatory role in MyoD activity (Fig. 7). In that regard, GRIP1 has no known HAT activity. Indeed, if GRIP1 binding to the MyoD NH2 terminus displaces p300/CBP and SRC1A and p/CIP, there would then be no known HAT domain bound strongly to MyoD. Accordingly, MyoD would then remain in an unacetylated and, hence, inactive state. Experiments to directly assess these possibilities are in progress.

A lead monolayer supported on a copper (111) surface was investigated as the temperature was raised through the melting transition of the film. Electron spectra and momentum distribution maps of the liquid film revealed three key features of the electronic structure of liquids: the persistence of a Fermi surface, the filling of band gaps, and the localization of the wave functions upon melting. Distinct coherence lengths for different sheets of the Fermi surface were found, indicating a strong dependence of the localization lengths on the character of the constituent atomic wave functions."
https://openalex.org/W2164134751,"A Mu transpososome assembled on negatively supercoiled DNA traps five supercoils by intertwining the left (L) and right (R) ends of Mu with an enhancer element (E). To investigate the contribution of DNA supercoiling to this elaborate synapse in which E and L cross once, E and R twice, and L and R twice, we have analyzed DNA crossings in a transpososome assembled on nicked substrates under conditions that bypass the supercoiling requirement for transposition. We find that the transposase MuA can recreate an essentially similar topology on nicked substrates, interwrapping both E-R and L-R twice but being unable to generate the single E-L crossing. In addition, we deduce that the functional MuA tetramer must contribute to three of the four observed crossings and, thus, to restraining the enhancer within the complex. We discuss the contribution of both MuA and DNA supercoiling to the 5-noded Mu synapse built at the 3-way junction."
https://openalex.org/W2014873573,"Abstract Sin1p/Spt2p is a yeast chromatin protein that, when mutated or deleted, alters the transcription of a family of genes presumably by modulating local chromatin structure. In this study, we investigated the ability of different domains of this protein to bind four-way junction DNA (4WJDNA) since 4WJDNA can serve as a model for bent double helical DNA and for the crossed structure formed at the exit and entry of DNA to the nucleosomes. Sequence alignment of Sin1p/Spt2p homologues from 11 different yeast species showed conservation of several domains. We found that three domains of Sin1p/Spt2p fused to glutathione S-transferase can each bind independently in a structure-specific manner to 4WJDNA as measured in a gel mobility shift assay. A feature common to these domains is a cluster of positively charged amino acids. Modification of this cluster resulted in either abolishment of binding or a change in the binding properties. One of the domains tested clearly bound superhelical DNA, although it failed to induce bending in a circularization assay. Poly-l-lysine, which may be viewed as a cluster of positively charged amino acids, bound 4WJDNA as well. Phenotypic analysis showed that disruption of any of these domains resulted in suppression of a his4-912δ allele, indicating that each domain has functional significance. We propose that Sin1p/Spt2p is likely to modulate local chromatin structure by binding two strands of double-stranded DNA at their crossover point."
