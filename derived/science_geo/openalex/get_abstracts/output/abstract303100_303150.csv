https://openalex.org/W2026557438,"Bitumen is a common associate of carbonate-hosted lead-zinc deposits. On the Pine Point lead-zinc property, Northwest Territories, Canada, there are two forms of bitumen. Unaltered bitumens have atomic hydrogen/carbon ratios of about 1.4, sulfur contents of about 7.8 percent, and sulfur isotope ratios (δ34S) of approximately +4.6 per mil. Altered bitumens occur in proximity to sulfide ore bodies and white sparry dolomite. Their hydrogen/carbon ratios are about 1.02, the sulfur contents average 22 percent, and the δ34S values are about +12.4 per mil. These data indicate that some bitumen has participated in the thermochemical reduction of sulfate to produce hydrogen sulfide required to precipitate the ores. Mass balance considerations show that the amount and degree of alteration of bitumen is more than adequate to account for the reduced sulfur species (lead, zinc, and iron sulfides) deposited at Pine Point. These reactions may provide an important means of generating the large volumes of sulfide necessary to precipitate ore bodies in carbonate rocks."
https://openalex.org/W1977224850,"The results of an analysis of more than 60,000 atmospheric measurements of carbon monoxide taken over 3(1/2) years at Cape Meares, Oregon (45 degrees N, 125 degrees W), indicate that the background concentration of this gas is increasing. The rate of increase, although uncertain, is about 6 percent per year on average. Human activities are the likely cause of a substantial portion of this observed increase; however, because of the short atmospheric lifetime of carbon monoxide and the relatively few years of observations, fluctuations of sources and sinks related to the natural variability of climate may have affected the observed trend. Increased carbon monoxide may deplete tropospheric hydroxyl radicals, slowing down the removal of dozens of man-made and anthropogenic trace gases and thus indirectly affecting the earth's climate and possibly the stratospheric ozone layer."

It is suggested that these wood-decay fungi utilize the nutrients in their prey to supplement the low levels of nitrogen available in wood. This mode of nutrition is similar in principle to that of carnivorous higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2095034518,"Phycoerythrin conjugates are reagents for cell sorting and analyses in which the argon-ion laser line at 488 nanometers is used for excitation. Many marine Synechococcus strains contain phycoerythrins with absorption maxima at approximately 490 and 550 nanometers; these maxima indicate the presence of phycourobilin and phycoerythrobilin prosthetic groups in the protein. Phycoerythrins of red algae contain both groups, but those of freshwater and soil cyanobacteria contain only phycoerythrobilin. Phycoerythrin purified from Synechococcus WH8103 has molecular properties typical of red algal phycoerythrins, but its phycourobilin content is higher than that of other phycoerythrins. The protein has absorption maxima at 492 and 543 nanometers and corresponding molar extinction coefficients of 2.78 and 1.14 x 10(6); it fluoresces maximally at 565 nanometers with a quantum yield of 0.5. Conjugates of Synechococcus WH8103 phycoerythrin could increase the sensitivity of cell analysis techniques to almost twice that possible with other phycoerythrin conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2070426579,"Infaunal and reclining bivalves of the Late Triassic Cassian Formation of northern Italy contain drillholes that closely resemble those produced by modern naticid gastropods. The oldest drillholes previously reported are from the late Early Cretaceous; this suggests that the drilling adaptation was lost soon after its appearance in the Late Triassic and originated independently in another naticid clade 120 million years later. The perceived selective value of such an adaptation may thus not always be a good predictor of its long-term survival, which is ultimately governed by factors that affect the speciation and extinction rates of the clade that carries it."

These turtles spent more time per exposure in solutions made of Padre Island sand and seawater than in control solutions in a multiple-choice test. This is evidence that sea turtles may detect differences in natural water samples and remember olfactory cues to which they were exposed neonatally and that these differences may affect their orientation behavior. This suggests that imprinting could be used as a conservation technique for establishing new breeding populations of endangered sea turtles."
https://openalex.org/W2035673091,"A charge-mosaic membrane was prepared from a pentablock copolymer of the BABCB type by selectively introducing anion and cation exchange groups into the microseparated phases. The three-layer lamellar structure of the starting pentablock copolymer film was not disturbed by the modifications. The membrane obtained was highly permeable only to sodium chloride in mixed aqueous solutions of sodium chloride and organic species of low molecular weight, such as sucrose. Marked pH-dependent permeabilities were also observed for amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2054398792,"Carbon-14 contents as low as 3.3 +/- 0.2 percent modern (apparent age, 27,000 years) measured from the shells of snails Melanoides tuberculatus living in artesian springs in southern Nevada are attributed to fixation of dissolved HCO(3)(-) with which the shells are in carbon isotope equilibrium. Recognition of the existence of such extreme deficiencies is necessary so that erroneous ages are not attributed to freshwater biogenic carbonates."
https://openalex.org/W2089918164,"The 8000-ton water IMB nucleon decay detector has good sensitivity to the neutrino burst associated with the collapse of stars. It is particularly sensitive to the v(e) charged current interactions with protons but can also record other neutrino interactions through ve scattering. Signal, noise, physics objectives, and detector modifications that would enhance burst detection are discussed. The objectives include astrophysical questions about the pulse structure and power. It also may be possible with a distant source to study neutrino masses and neutrino oscillations."

https://openalex.org/W2099223784,Profiles of grain sizes in five cores recovered from Lake Superior show that grain size increased with burial depth to the postglacial-glacial contact. The results reflect a substantial reduction in bottom-current velocity and the corresponding wind velocity from 9500 to 6500 years ago.
