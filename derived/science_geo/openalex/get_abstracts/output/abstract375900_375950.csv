In vitro studies have suggested that there are in the dorsal aorta a population of intermediate progenitors that can give rise to both endothelial (or blood vessel lineage) and blood cells. In this issue, two groups present images showing the birth of HSCs from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta in live zebrafish embryos. Bertrand et al. combined fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry to identify and isolate the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs. They also show that the HSCs generated from this haemogenic endothelium are the lineal founders of virtually all of the adult haematopoietic system. Karima Kissa and Philippe Herbomel similarly use imaging of live zebrafish to show HSCs emerge directly from the aorta floor, They show this process that does not involve cell division but movement of single endothelial cells out of the aorta ventral wall into the sub-aortic space, where they transform into haematopoietic cells. They call this new type of cell behaviour endothelial haematopoietic transition (EHT). In a third report, Boisset et al. confirm that this process also occurs in mice, using a dissection procedure to visualize the deeply located aorta. They showed de novo emergence of phenotypically defined HSCs directly from ventral aortic haemogenic endothelial cells. One of two papers showing the generation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta in live zebrafish embryos. Here, combined fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry identify and isolate the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs. HSCs generated from this haemogenic endothelium are the lineal founders of virtually all of the adult haematopoietic system. A major goal of regenerative medicine is to instruct formation of multipotent, tissue-specific stem cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for cell replacement therapies. Generation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from iPSCs or embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is not currently possible, however, necessitating a better understanding of how HSCs normally arise during embryonic development. We previously showed that haematopoiesis occurs through four distinct waves during zebrafish development, with HSCs arising in the final wave in close association with the dorsal aorta. Recent reports have suggested that murine HSCs derive from haemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) lining the aortic floor1,2. Additional in vitro studies have similarly indicated that the haematopoietic progeny of ESCs arise through intermediates with endothelial potential3,4. Here we have used the unique strengths of the zebrafish embryo to image directly the generation of HSCs from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta. Using combinations of fluorescent reporter transgenes, confocal time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry, we have identified and isolated the stepwise intermediates as aortic haemogenic endothelium transitions to nascent HSCs. Finally, using a permanent lineage tracing strategy, we demonstrate that the HSCs generated from haemogenic endothelium are the lineal founders of the adult haematopoietic system."

The miRNA machinery interacts with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which functions as translational repressor. We show that miR-125b and miR-132, as well as several other miRNAs, are associated with FMRP in mouse brain. miR-125b and miR-132 had largely opposing effects on dendritic spine morphology and synaptic physiology in hippocampal neurons. FMRP knockdown ameliorates the effect of miRNA overexpression on spine morphology. We identified NMDA receptor subunit NR2A as a target of miR-125b and show that NR2A mRNA is specifically associated with FMRP in brain. In hippocampal neurons, NR2A expression is negatively regulated through its 3′ UTR by FMRP, miR-125b, and Argonaute 1. Regulation of NR2A 3′UTR by FMRP depends in part on miR-125b. Because NMDA receptor subunit composition profoundly affects synaptic plasticity, these observations have implications for the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome, in which plasticity is altered.

Because NMDA receptor subunit composition profoundly affects synaptic plasticity, these observations have implications for the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome, in which plasticity is altered. A large set of microRNAs are biochemically associated with FMRP in mouse brain miR-125b promotes thinner spines and weaker synapses; miR-132 induces opposite changes The NMDA receptor subunit NR2A is regulated by FMRP and miR-125b through its 3′ UTR These effects involve a functional interaction between these miRNAs and FMRP MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (∼22 nucleotide) noncoding RNAs that mediate posttranscriptional gene silencing (Filipowicz et al., 2008Filipowicz W.

Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). miRNAs are loaded into effector proteins of the Argonaute family. Once loaded the Argonaute protein is said to be “programmed” with the miRNA, which guides the Argonaute protein to specific mRNA targets. miRNAs usually bind their target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) and impact protein expression by inhibiting mRNA translation or by promoting mRNA decay. In mammals, several hundred distinct miRNAs have been discovered, including those selectively expressed in the brain (Cao et al., 2006Cao X. Yeo G. Muotri A.R. Kuwabara T. Gage F.H. Noncoding RNAs in the mammalian central nervous system.Annu. Rev.

Dawson V.L. Understanding microRNAs in neurodegeneration.Nat. Rev.

Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In mammals, miR-132 regulates dendrite development by targeting p250GAP (Vo et al., 2005Vo N. Klein M.E. Varlamova O.

Fragile X syndrome: loss of local mRNA regulation alters synaptic development and function.Neuron. 2008; 60: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), is usually due to a trinucleotide expansion in the FMR1 gene that results in transcriptional silencing of FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) expression. FMRP contains multiple RNA-binding domains and is widely thought to function as a translational suppressor of specific mRNAs, including MAP1b, CaMKIIα, and Arc (Bassell and Warren, 2008Bassell G.J.

FMRP is biochemically and genetically linked to the miRNA pathway. FMRP interacts with proteins (e.g., Argonaute and Dicer) in the RNA interference silencing complex (RISC) and with miRNAs, but FMRP itself is not essential for RNAi-mediated mRNA cleavage (Bolduc et al., 2008Bolduc F.V.

Biotechnol. 2006; 2006: 64347PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous loss of AGO1 enhances the phenotype of heterozygous loss of FMRP in flies, suggesting AGO1 facilitates translational repression by FMRP (Bolduc et al., 2008Bolduc F.V. Bell K. Cox H.

Biochemical and genetic interaction between the fragile X mental retardation protein and the microRNA pathway.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). One hypothesis is that specific miRNAs—as part of the FMRP translation regulatory complex—could facilitate selection and/or suppression of target mRNAs by FMRP (Jin et al., 2004aJin P. Alisch R.S. Warren S.T. RNA and microRNAs in fragile X mental retardation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, no specific example of such a functional association of FMRP, mRNA, and miRNA has been identified. Although ∼22 nucleotide RNA has been detected in the FMRP-complex (Caudy et al., 2002Caudy A.A. Myers M. Hannon G.J. Hammond S.M. Fragile X-related protein and VIG associate with the RNA interference machinery.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2491-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, Ishizuka et al., 2002Ishizuka A. Siomi M.C.

Biochemical and genetic interaction between the fragile X mental retardation protein and the microRNA pathway.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), it is unknown which specific miRNAs associate with FMRP in mammals. We hypothesized that such FMRP-associated miRNAs might regulate synaptic function and dendritic spine structure, given the well-established synaptic abnormalities found in FMR1 knockout (KO) mice that are also central to the pathogenesis of FXS in humans (Comery et al., 1997Comery T.A. Harris J.B. Willems P.J. Oostra B.A. Irwin S.A. Weiler I.J. Greenough W.T. Abnormal dendritic spines in fragile X knockout mice: maturation and pruning deficits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genet. 2001; 98: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Here we report that two FMRP-associated miRNAs (miR-125b and miR-132) can affect dendritic spine morphology. For both miRNAs, we identified specific mRNA targets that are also associated with FMRP and encode key proteins involved in synaptic function. To identify FMRP-associated miRNAs, we purified FMRP from mouse brain using FMRP antibodies and isolated the associated miRNAs following a protocol commonly used for the identification of mRNA targets of FMRP (Brown et al., 2001Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D.

As a control for specificity of miRNA association, we also used FMRP antibodies to immunoprecipitate from FMR1 KO brains (Figure 1A ). We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to measure the amount of mature miRNAs coimmunoprecipitated with anti-FMRP antibodies. A specific set of miRNAs was quantified: the brain-specific miRNAs 9, 124, 128; miRNAs 132 and 219, which are inducible by CREB, an important transcription factor implicated in learning and memory; and two miRNAs previously reported to regulate spine morphology, miRNAs 134 and 138 (Cao et al., 2006Cao X.

Neurosci. 2006; 29: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, Schratt et al., 2006Schratt G.M. Tuebing F. Nigh E.A. Kane C.G. Sabatini M.E. Kiebler M. Greenberg M.E.

A cAMP-response element binding protein-induced microRNA regulates neuronal morphogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 16426-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Additionally, we looked for broadly expressed miRNAs of high (miRNAs 26a, 29a, 125b, 127, and let-7c), intermediate (miRNAs 22, and 125a), and low abundance (miRNAs 27b, 100, and 143) (Landgraf et al., 2007Landgraf P. Rusu M. Sheridan R. Sewer A. Iovino N. Aravin A. Pfeffer S. Rice A. Kamphorst A.O.

Sohn-Lee C. Rouhanifard S.H. Ludwig J. Hafner M. Mihailovic A. Lim C. Holoch D. Berninger P. Zavolan M. Tuschl T. miRNA in situ hybridization in formaldehyde and EDC-fixed tissues.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Twelve of these candidate miRNAs were found to associate with FMRP (Figure 1B). That is, let-7c, miR-9, 100, 124, 125a, 125b, 127, 128, 132, 138, 143, and 219 were enriched 3- to 7-fold in FMRP immunoprecipitates from age-matched wild-type brains as compared with control immunoprecipitates from FMR1 KO brains. Expression levels for all tested miRNAs were indistinguishable between brains from wild-type and FMR1 KO mice (data not shown). In addition, a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA-135) and five other miRNAs (miR-22, 26a, 27b, 29a, and 134) did not show significant coprecipitation with FMRP above the background seen in FMR1 KO brain, indicating that there is selectivity of miRNA association with FMRP (Figure 1B). We asked whether specific miRNAs associated with FMRP might be involved in the regulation of spine morphogenesis. To determine the gain-of-function phenotype of the miRNAs, we transfected dissociated rat hippocampal neurons in culture with DNA plasmids that express the precursor-miRNA hairpin under the control of a β-actin promoter (Zeng et al., 2005Zeng Y. Cai X. Cullen B.R. Use of RNA polymerase II to transcribe artificial microRNAs.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 392: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the mature miRNA in neurons was validated using EGFP-based miRNA-sensors containing artificial miRNA target sites in their 3′UTR (see Figure S1A available online). Hippocampal neurons were transfected at 14 days in vitro (DIV14) with individual miRNAs and EGFP marker for 3 days (DIV14+3). Dendritic protrusions were differentially affected by miR-125b and miR-132. Overexpression of miR-125b resulted in longer and thinner protrusions (Figures 2A–2C ). In neurons overexpressing miR-125b, ∼20% of dendritic protrusions were very long (>3 μm), versus ∼5%–10% in untransfected neurons or in neurons transfected with other miRNAs (Figure 2E). This difference was even more marked for protrusions > 5 μm. Protrusion density was not affected. miR-125b, let-7c, miR-22, miR-124, miR-132, and miR-143 did not have a statistically significant effect on dendritic growth or arborization as measured by Sholl analysis (Figures 2A and S2). In contrast, neurons overexpressing miR-132 were characterized by stubby and mushroom spines (Figure 2A). Overexpressed miR-132 caused an increase in average protrusion width, without affecting the average length (Figures 2B and 2C). In addition, average protrusion density fell significantly by ∼15% (Figure 2D). The effects of miRNAs 125b and 132 on dendritic spine width appear to be specific, because overexpression of let-7c, miR-22, miR-124, miR-9, and miR-128 (Figure 2 and data not shown) had no significant effect on spine number or shape compared with vector control. Although miR-132 has been implicated in regulating neuron morphology (Siegel et al., 2009Siegel G. Obernosterer G. Fiore R. Oehmen M. Bicker S. Christensen M. Khudayberdiev S. Leuschner P.F.

USA. 2008; 105: 9093-9098Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), here we show a role for miR-125b in spine morphogenesis. To test whether regulation of spine morphology by miR-125b and 132 is dependent on FMRP, we overexpressed the miRNA constructs in neurons either with FMRP-shRNA or control luciferase shRNA constructs (Zhang and Macara, 2006Zhang H. Macara I.G. The polarity protein PAR-3 and TIAM1 cooperate in dendritic spine morphogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In our experiments, FMRP knockdown (DIV14+3) by itself did not affect spine morphology (Figure 3). The lack of effect of FMRP suppression might be explained by the acute manipulation (compared with FMR1 KO mice) and by the fact that the effect of FMRP on spine morphology declines in neurons of this age (Nimchinsky et al., 2001Nimchinsky E.A. Oberlander A.M. Svoboda K. Abnormal development of dendritic spines in FMR1 knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5139-5146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We validated FMRP-knockdown and specificity of two shRNA constructs (#1 and #2) in HEK293 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure S3). ShRNA FMRP #1 (and to a lesser extent #2) reduced expression of cotransfected EGFP-FMRP (Antar et al., 2004Antar L.N. Afroz R. Dictenberg J.B. Carroll R.C. Bassell G.J. Metabotropic glutamate receptor activation regulates fragile x mental retardation protein and FMR1 mRNA localization differentially in dendrites and at synapses.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2648-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and endogenous FMRP immunofluorescence. Control Luc shRNA expression did not affect the differential spine phenotypes induced by miR-125 or 132 overexpression (Figure 2, Figure 3). Compared with miR-143, a miRNA that does not affect dendritic spines (Figure 2), miR-125b-overexpressing neurons had significantly longer and thinner dendritic protrusions, whereas miR-132 expression increased protrusion width and reduced spine density. In cells with knockdown of FMRP, however, the effects of miR-125 and 132 were abolished and spine morphology was not significantly different from miR-143 control. These data indicate that FMRP is required for miR-125b and 132 to alter spine morphology. Because FMRP is not needed for general RNAi function (Caudy et al., 2002Caudy A.A. Myers M. Hannon G.J. Hammond S.M. Fragile X-related protein and VIG associate with the RNA interference machinery.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2491-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, Hock et al., 2007Hock J. Weinmann L. Ender C. Rudel S. Kremmer E. Raabe M. Urlaub H. Meister G. Proteomic and functional analysis of Argonaute-containing mRNA-protein complexes in human cells.EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 1052-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), these findings support the idea that the FMRP-associated miRNAs 125b and 132 modulate dendritic spine morphology together with FMRP through common mRNA targets. To investigate the loss-of-function phenotype of individual miRNAs on spine morphology, we applied the plasmid-based “sponge” method of Ebert et al., 2007Ebert M.S. Neilson J.R. Sharp P.A. MicroRNA sponges: competitive inhibitors of small RNAs in mammalian cells.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar. Overexpression of mRNA constructs containing multiple (five to seven) concatenated miRNA binding sites with central mismatches (that prevent AGO2-mediated mRNA cleavage) results in the sequestration of endogenous miRNAs that bind to these sequences (Figure S1B). Because the eight 5′-most nucleotides of a miRNA, the so-called “seed” region, is thought to be critical for target sequence recognition, this approach leads to cross-capture of related miRNA isoforms with identical seed regions (e.g., let-7a through let-7i, or miR-125a and 125b). In these cases, the sponge constructs are denoted according to the miRNA family sequestered (e.g., let-7 and miR-125 sponge). Specificity and efficacy of miRNA suppression was confirmed for each sponge in hippocampal neurons, indicating sufficient sequestration and functional suppression of targeted endogenous miRNAs. For example, transfection of a sponge construct for miR-124, the most abundant miRNA in brain, upregulated expression of a sensor containing target sequences for miR-124 by ∼5-fold, but had no effect on other sensors containing unrelated miRNA target sites (Figure S1C). The effects of individual miRNA sponges on neuron morphology were examined in hippocampal neurons 3 days after transfection (DIV14+3) (Figure 4). Loss-of-function of the abundant neuronal miRNAs let-7 and miR-124, and of the less abundant miR-125 and miR-132 (Landgraf et al., 2007Landgraf P. Rusu M. Sheridan R. Sewer A. Iovino N. Aravin A.

Primary dendrites ramified less and the dendritic arbor covered a smaller area. By contrast, sponges targeting miR-22 and miR-143 had little effect on dendrite complexity (Figures 4A and 4E). Conversely to miR-125b gain-of-function, which reduced spine width (Figure 2C), miR-125 loss-of-function significantly increased protrusion width (Figure 4C). Moreover, neurons transfected with sponges for let-7, miR-22 and miR-124 also showed a modest but significant increase in protrusion width. Only the let-7 sponge significantly increased protrusion length (Figure 4B) and none of the sponge constructs tested affected the density of protrusions (Figure 4D). The lack of effect of sponging of miR-132 and miR-143 could be explained by an activity-dependent role for miR-132 and low basal expression of miR-132 and miR-143 (Landgraf et al., 2007Landgraf P. Rusu M. Sheridan R. Sewer A. Iovino N. Aravin A. Pfeffer S. Rice A. Kamphorst A.O. Landthaler M. et al.A mammalian microRNA expression atlas based on small RNA library sequencing.Cell. 2007; 129: 1401-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Because overexpression and sponging of miR-125b had opposite effects on protrusion width, these data corroborate the idea that miR-125b is important for regulating spine morphology. Spine size often correlates with synaptic strength. We therefore measured AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with miR-125b and miR-132 constructs (Figure 5). Overexpression of miR-125b resulted in a significant 25% drop in mean mEPSC amplitude (Figures 5A and 5C). The weakening of synaptic transmission is consistent with the long thin protrusions and the reduced spine width induced by miR-125b (Figure 2C). In neurons overexpressing miR-125b, mEPSC frequency fell relative to control neurons transfected with empty vector, but this did not reach the level of statistical significance (Figure 5C). Suppressing endogenous miR-125b activity with the miR-125 sponge had no significant effect on mEPSC amplitude or frequency (Figures 5A and 5C), consistent with the modest effect of miR-125b sponging on spine morphology (Figure 4). In contrast to miR-125b, overexpression of miR-132 led to an increase in mean mEPSC amplitude (Figures 5B and 5D), consistent with the wider spines induced by miR-132 (Figure 2C). Miniature EPSC frequency was also considerably elevated by miR-132 overexpression (Figure 5D), even though spine density was decreased by this miRNA (Figures 2D and 3D). This could reflect a greater number of miniature events detected with the increased amplitude of mEPSC. The miR-132 sponge did not affect either amplitude or frequency of mEPSCs. Overall, these electrophysiological findings are consistent with and corroborate the effects of miR-125b and miR-132 on the structure of dendritic spines. We asked which target genes might mediate the bidirectional effects of miR-125b and miR-132 on synaptic physiology. shRNA-mediated knockdown of the known miR-132 target p250GAP was recently found to increase dendritic spine size (Nakazawa et al., 2008Nakazawa T.

We focused on miR-125b target mRNAs predicted by TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2005Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

Target prediction mainly relies on the presence of a seed match to a miRNA in the 3′UTR of an mRNA that is conserved between species. For example, the 3′UTR of the NR2A subunit of NMDA receptors contains such a conserved sequence complementary to the seed region of miR-125b (Figure 6A ). To validate candidate miRNA targets, we fused the 3′UTRs of the specific mRNAs to the coding sequence of firefly luciferase (FF-luc). The FF-luc reporter construct was then cotransfected with plasmids expressing individual miRNAs in HEK293 cells, along with a plasmid encoding Renilla reniformis luciferase (RR-luc) for normalization. miRNA expression was validated using FF-luc reporters containing perfect-match miRNA target-sites (Figure S4). Most of the tested FF-luc 3′UTR reporters of predicted target genes were unaffected by miRNA coexpression (Figure S5). We found slight suppression of GluR2 (by miR-124a) and Eph receptor A4 (EphA4, by let-7c, miR-22 and possibly miR-125b). Only the NR2A 3′UTR reporter was strongly inhibited by coexpression of miR-125b (∼45%), consistent with the conserved seed match (Figures 6A and 6B). By contrast, coexpression of let-7c, miR-22 and miR-124 had no effect on NR2A reporter expression, and no seed matches to these miRNAs exist in the NR2A 3′UTR.

Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) indicate that DGLα and/or DGLβ are major 2-AG synthesizing enzymes. To determine to what extent 2-AG mediates retrograde signaling and to clarify the relative contributions of DGLα and DGLβ in 2-AG biosynthesis, we generated mutant mouse lines lacking either of the two DGL isoforms. By analyzing these knockout mice, we demonstrate that 2-AG produced by DGLα, not by DGLβ, is a ubiquitous retrograde messenger at central synapses. We generated null mutant mice lacking either DGLα or DGLβ by homologous recombination using the ES cell line RENKA, which we developed from the C57BL/6N strain (Mishina and Sakimura, 2007Mishina M. Sakimura K. Conditional gene targeting on the pure C57BL/6 genetic background.Neurosci. Res. 2007; 58: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), followed by Cre-mediated deletion of the targeted genes (Figure 1 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). DGLα knockout (α-KO) and DGLβ knockout (β-KO) mice were generated by disrupting exon 3 and 4 of Dagla gene (Figures 1A and 1C) and exon 10 and 11 of Daglb gene (Figures 1B and 1E), respectively. The resulting α-KO and β-KO mice are viable and appear normal with regard to their general appearances. Nissl staining of brains of α-KO and β-KO mice show that there are no perceptive abnormalities in the two knockout mice (Figure S1-1 available online). We verified that DGLα expression was normal in the brain of β-KO mice (Figure S2-2), whereas DGLα immunoreactivity was totally absent in α-KO mice (Figures 1D and S1-2). We confirmed that the DGLβ transcript was absent in the forebrain and cerebellum of β-KO mice (Figure 1F). We examined basic properties of synaptic transmission in acute slices of the cerebellum and striatum. Overall, kinetics of synaptic currents and paired-pulse ratio of α-KO and β-KO mice were not different from that of their wild-type (WT) littermates (Table S1 available online). We measured basal 2-AG contents in the cerebellum, striatum, and hippocampus, and found that the 2-AG contents were markedly decreased in α-KO mice (Figure 1G), whereas they were normal in the three brain regions of β-KO mice (Figure 1G). Therefore, the contribution of DGLα to 2-AG biosynthesis seems to be much greater than that of DGLβ in the CNS. In addition, basal contents of anandamide were decreased in the cerebellum and hippocampus of α-KO mice, whereas they were normal in β-KO mice (Figure S1-3). We examined retrograde suppression of synaptic transmission by the three modes of endocannabinoid release in acute cerebellar slices. In WT mice, strong depolarization of Purkinje cells (PCs) caused Ca2+-driven ER and readily induced transient suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission (depolarization-induced suppression of excitation [DSE]) from parallel fibers (PFs) (Figures 2A and 2B “PF-PC”) and climbing fibers (CFs) (Figure 2B “CF-PC”), as well as transient suppression of synaptic transmission from inhibitory interneurons (INs) (depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition [DSI]) (Figure 2B “IN-PC”). DSE also occurred at PF to IN synapses following depolarization of INs (Figure 2B “PF-IN”). By marked contrast, DSE and DSI were totally absent in PCs and INs of α-KO mice (Figures 2A and 2B). We verified that Ca2+ transients in PCs following DSE/DSI-inducing depolarization (Figures S2-1A through S2-1D), and cannabinoid sensitivities of PFs, CFs, and inhibitory synaptic terminals (Figure S2-1E), were normal in α-KO mice. These results indicate that the deficiency of DSE/DSI in α-KO cerebellum is not attributable to decreased Ca2+ transients, and that DGLα is indispensable for Ca2+-driven ER in the cerebellum. We then examined whether basal RER and Ca2+-assisted RER were affected by deletion of DGLα. To test basal RER, we activated metabotropic glutamate receptor-subtype 1 (mGluR1), a Gq/11-coupled receptor strongly expressed in PCs, by bath application of its agonist, R,S-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). DHPG (50 μM) readily induced reversible suppression in WT mice, but this receptor-mediated suppression was totally absent in α-KO mice (Figure 2C). As for Ca2+-assisted RER, marginal DSE at CF-PC synapses by weak depolarization of PCs was prominently enhanced when combined with subthreshold mGluR1 activation by a low dose of DHPG (10 μM) in WT mice (Maejima et al., 2005Maejima T. Oka S. Hashimotodani Y. Ohno-Shosaku T. Aiba A. Wu D. Waku K. Sugiura T. Kano M.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (Figures 2D and 2E). Furthermore, a brief burst of PF stimulation caused Ca2+-assisted RER by synaptically activated mGluR1 and transiently suppressed PF-PC transmission in WT mice (Brown et al., 2003Brown S.P. Brenowitz S.D. Regehr W.G. Brief presynaptic bursts evoke synapse-specific retrograde inhibition mediated by endogenous cannabinoids.Nat.

Notably, both forms of Ca2+-assisted RER were totally absent in α-KO mice (Figures 2D–2F). We verified that expression patterns and protein levels of molecules involved in endocannabinid signaling (mGluR1, phospholipase C [PLC] β4, and CB1) (Maejima et al., 2001Maejima T. Hashimoto K.

Frequency detection and temporally dispersed synaptic signal association through a metabotropic glutamate receptor pathway.Nature. 1997; 385: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were normal in the α-KO cerebellum (Figure S2-2). These results indicate that the lack of basal and Ca2+-assisted RER in the cerebellum of α-KO mice is not attributable to changes in the expression of endocannabinoid signaling molecules. We also performed a biochemical experiment to measure stimulus-induced production of 2-AG in cerebellar slices. Combined application of DHPG (100 μM) and high K+ (20 mM) solution elevated 2-AG level in WT mice (Figure 2G), which mimicked Ca2+-driven RER in electrophysiological experiments (Maejima et al., 2005Maejima T. Oka S. Hashimotodani Y. Ohno-Shosaku T. Aiba A. Wu D. Waku K. Sugiura T. Kano M.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, this combined stimulation caused no elevation of 2-AG in α-KO mice (Figure 2G). Importantly, the same stimulation caused no change in anandamide contents in cerebellar slices of WT and α-KO mice (Figure 2H). These results indicate that DGLα is indispensable for basal and Ca2+-assisted RER in the cerebellum. We then examined endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde suppression in the hippocampus and striatum. In cultured hippocampal neurons, paired whole-cell recordings were performed and EPSCs and cannabinoid-sensitive unitary IPSCs were pharmacologically isolated. In WT mice, DSI (Figures 3A and 3B) and DSE (Figure 3B) were readily induced in the cannabinoid-sensitive IPSCs and EPSCs, respectively, following depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron from −80 mV to 0 mV for 5 s (Ohno-Shosaku et al., 2001Ohno-Shosaku T.

Tsubokawa H. Mizushima I. Yoneda N. Zimmer A. Kano M. Presynaptic cannabinoid sensitivity is a major determinant of depolarization-induced retrograde suppression at hippocampal synapses.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3864-3872PubMed Google Scholar). The same depolarization protocols caused no appreciable suppression in IPSCs or EPSCs in hippocampal cultures prepared from α-KO mice (Figures 3A and 3B). In WT hippocampal neurons, activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors, mGluR5 by DHPG, and M1/M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR-M1/M3) by oxotremorine-M (oxo-M) readily induced endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde suppression of IPSCs (Figure 3B). By contrast, these forms of receptor-mediated retrograde suppression were totally absent in α-KO mice (Figure 3B). We also examined endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde suppression in hippocampal slices. Whole-cell recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal cells and IPSCs were evoked by stimulation in the stratum radiatum. DSI was readily induced by a series of depolarizing pulses (10 pulses of 100 ms duration, from −70 mV to 0 mV, repeated at 1 Hz) in WT mice, whereas DSI was totally absent in α-KO mice (Figure 3B). Bath application of DHPG (100 μM) caused long-term depression of IPSCs (I-LTD) in WT mice, as reported previously (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003Chevaleyre V. Castillo P.E. Heterosynaptic LTD of hippocampal GABAergic synapses: a novel role of endocannabinoids in regulating excitability.Neuron. 2003; 38: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In contrast, DHPG failed to induce I-LTD in α-KO mice (Figure S3-1). In striatal slices, whole-cell recordings were performed from medium spiny neurons and inhibitory inputs were stimulated around the recorded neurons (Narushima et al., 2006Narushima M. Hashimoto K.

Tonic enhancement of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde suppression of inhibition by cholinergic interneuron activity in the striatum.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In WT mice, DSI was readily elicited by a depolarizing pulse from −70 mV to 0 mV (5 s duration) (Figure 3B), and marginal DSI by a short-depolarization (a depolarizing pulse from −70 mV to 0 mV, 1 s duration) was significantly enhanced by a low dose (0.5 μM) of oxo-M (Figures 3C and 3D). By marked contrast, DSI (Figure 3B) and the enhancement of marginal DSI by a low dose of oxo-M (Figures 3C and 3D) were totally absent in α-KO mice. We verified that cannabinoid sensitivities of IPSCs in hippocampal and striatal slices were normal in α-KO mice (Figure S3-2). Furthermore, we confirmed expression patterns and protein levels of molecules required for endocannabinoid signaling in the hippocampus and striatum (Hashimotodani et al., 2005Hashimotodani Y. Ohno-Shosaku T. Tsubokawa H. Ogata H. Emoto K. Maejima T. Araishi K. Shin H.S. Kano M.

Thus, the lack of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde suppression in their hippocampi and striati must result from the lack of DGLα. We then examined whether DGLβ also contributes to retrograde signaling. Morphology of the brain (Figure S1-1) and expression patterns and protein levels of mGluR1/5, PLCβ1/4, mAChR-M1, DGLα, and CB1 were normal in β-KO mice (Figures S2-2 and S3-3). We used the same experimental protocols to induce Ca2+-driven ER, basal RER, or Ca2+-assisted RER as used for WT and α-KO mice. We found that DSE at PF-PC synapses (Figures 4A and 4B) and DSI at IN-PC synapses (Figure 4B) in the cerebellum and DSI in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figures 4D and 4E) were normal in β-KO mice. Suppression of IPSCs induced by DHPG or oxo-M in hippocampal neurons was also normal (Figure 4E). Furthermore, suppression of PF-PC transmission by a PF burst was normal in β-KO mice (Figure 4C). Therefore, the three modes of endocannabinoid release, Ca2+-driven ER, basal RER, and Ca2+-assisted RER, are intact in β-KO mice. Taken together, the present results strongly suggest that 2-AG produced by DGLα, and not by DGLβ, mediates retrograde signaling at central synapses. We found that the three modes of endocannabinoid release and resultant retrograde suppression of synaptic transmission were totally absent in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum of α-KO mice. The basal 2-AG content was markedly reduced in the three brain structures and the stimulus-induced elevation of 2-AG levels was absent in the cerebellum of α-KO mice. By contrast, endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic suppression and 2-AG content were normal in β-KO mice. Although the anandamide level was reduced in the cerebellum and hippocampus of α-KO mice, the extent of reduction was much smaller than 2-AG content. The cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum have been most extensively studied for the mechanisms of endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic modulation. Many previous studies suggest that synapses in other brain regions share the same mechanisms of endocannabinoid release as those in the three brain structures (for review, see Chevaleyre et al., 2006Chevaleyre V.

Freund T.F. Endocannabinoid signaling as a synaptic circuit breaker in neurological disease.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest that 2-AG produced by DGLα, not by DGLβ, likely accounts for most retrograde signaling at synapses throughout the CNS, although the possibility remains that anandamide or other endocannabinoids may be involved in other synapses. Previous biochemical studies have revealed several pathways for 2-AG generation (Bisogno et al., 2005Bisogno T. Ligresti A. Di Marzo V. The endocannabinoid signalling system: biochemical aspects.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2005; 81: 224-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, Sugiura et al., 2006Sugiura T. Kishimoto S. Oka S.

Biodivers. 2007; 4: 1858-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the main pathway, PLCβ activated by Gq/11 hydrolyzes arachidonic acid-containing membrane phospholipid such as phosphatidylinositol, and produces arachidonic acid-containing diacylglycerol. Then, 2-AG is produced from the diacylglycerol by the action of DGLα and/or DGLβ. Besides this main cascade, alternative pathways for 2-AG generation are proposed, which include the sequential reactions by phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and lysoPI-specific PLC, the conversion from 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidic acid to 2-AG by phosphatase, and the formation from 2-arachidonoyl phosphatidic acid through 1-acyl-2-arachidonoylglycerol. However, the present results indicate that these alternative pathways are not involved in 2-AG generation for retrograde synaptic suppression. Previous studies indicate that DGLα is expressed at postsynaptic sites of the neurons in various regions of the CNS (Katona et al., 2006Katona I. Urbán G.M. Wallace M. Ledent C. Jung K.M. Piomelli D.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4740-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). DGLα is most abundant around dendritic spines and is apposed closely to Gq/11-coupled receptors, Gq/11 protein α subunit, and PLCβ. Such a subcellular arrangement of molecules constitutes an anatomical basis for basal and Ca2+-assisted RER (Hashimotodani et al., 2007aHashimotodani Y. Ohno-Shosaku T. Kano M.

Endocannabinoid-mediated control of synaptic transmission.Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 309-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The density of CB1 expression in excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals and the distances between the presynaptic terminals and the DGLα-rich postsynaptic structures are unique to each brain region (Katona et al., 1999Katona I. Sperlágh B. Sík A. Käfalvi A. Vizi E.S. Mackie K. Freund T.F. Presynaptically located CB1 cannabinoid receptors regulate GABA release from axon terminals of specific hippocampal interneurons.J.

The CB1 cannabinoid receptor is the major cannabinoid receptor at excitatory presynaptic sites in the hippocampus and cerebellum.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). DGLα seems to be arranged such that the induction threshold of 2-AG-mediated retrograde suppression of excitation and inhibition may be coordinated. In DGLα knockout mice, basal and Ca2+-assisted RER was totally absent, although subcellular localizations of Gq/11-coupled receptors, PLCβ, and CB1 were normal. Thus, the primary function of DGLα in central neurons seems to be the production of 2-AG that mediates retrograde synaptic suppression. In contrast to DGLα, relatively little is known about subcellular localization of DGLβ at synapses. DGLβ was reported to be richly expressed in the PC soma but very low in dendrites (Suárez et al., 2008Suárez J. Bermúdez-Silva F.J. Mackie K. Ledent C. Zimmer A. Cravatt B.F. de Fonseca F.R. Immunohistochemical description of the endogenous cannabinoid system in the rat cerebellum and functionally related nuclei.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 509: 400-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This expression pattern is clearly different from that of DGLα (Yoshida et al., 2006Yoshida T. Fukaya M. Uchigashima M. Miura E. Kamiya H. Kano M. Watanabe M. Localization of diacylglycerol lipase-α around postsynaptic spine suggests close proximity between production site of an endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, and presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptor.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4740-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We expected that DSI of IN-PC synapses would have been smaller in β-KO mice if DGLβ in the PC soma had played a role in 2-AG production, because in this experiment we stimulated putative basket cell axons that form inhibitory synapses on the PC soma. However, our results demonstrate that DSI is normal in β-KO mice, suggesting that DGLβ has no contribution to retrograde synaptic suppression in PCs. In a recent study, DGLβ and DGLα were reported to be coexpressed in postsynaptic sites facing CB1-rich excitatory terminals in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (Zhao et al., 2009Zhao Y. Rubio M.E. Tzounopoulos T. Distinct functional and anatomical architecture of the endocannabinoid system in the auditory brainstem.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 2434-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is possible that DGLβ may participate in 2-AG production at synapses in limited brain regions. Besides retrograde suppression at synapses, endocannabinoid signaling is reported to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival during CNS development (Harkany et al., 2007Harkany T. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. Berghuis P. Devi L.A. Mackie K. The emerging functions of endocannabinoid signaling during CNS development.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, our morphological investigation revealed no apparent abnormality in gross anatomy of the α-KO and β-KO brains. Furthermore, basal synaptic transmission was normal in the cerebellum and striatum of α-KO and β-KO mice, indicating normal wiring and function of neural circuits. It is possible that the lack of DGLα or DGLβ may be compensated for by other signaling molecules during CNS development. Behavioral studies have clarified the roles of the endocannabinoid system in various brain functions, including acquisition and/or extinction of certain forms of memory, regulation of anxious states, antidepressant effects, rewarding effects of some addictive compounds, promotion of appetite, relieving pain, and protecting neurons (for review, see Iversen, 2003Iversen L. Cannabis and the brain.Brain. 2003; 126: 1252-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, Kano et al., 2009Kano M. Ohno-Shosaku T. Hashimotodani Y. Uchigashima M. Watanabe M. Endocannabinoid-mediated control of synaptic transmission.Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 309-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Many previous studies adopted pharmacological alteration of endocannabinoid signaling and/or local lesions to certain brain structures. However, such manipulations sometimes exert complex effects on animals' behaviors and thus the results are not necessarily consistent. In this respect, α-KO and β-KO mice will be useful tools for elucidating neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of the endocannabinoid system. These mouse lines are also useful to clarify distinct roles of anandamide and 2-AG in various aspects of brain functions. Experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the animal welfare committees of the University of Tokyo, Hokkaido University, and Niigata University. α-KO and β-KO mice were generated by disrupting exon 3 and 4 of Dagla gene and exon 10 and 11 of Daglb gene, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 1 and detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Mice were decapitated following CO2 anesthesia, and brains were rapidly removed and placed in chilled external solution (0°C–4°C) containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). For preparing hippocampal and striatal slices, NaCl was replaced with Choline-Cl. Parasagittal cerebellar slices (250 μm thick), transverse hippocampal slices (300 μm thick), or coronal forebrain slices containing the striatum (300 μm thick) were prepared by using a vibratome slicer (Leica, Germany). Whole-cell recordings were made from visually identified PCs, CA1 pyramidal cells, or medium spiny neurons using an upright microscope (Olympus, Tokyo) at 32°C. Compositions of the pipette solutions and protocols of stimulation and recording are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared from newborn mice as described (Ohno-Shosaku et al., 2001Ohno-Shosaku T. Maejima T. Kano M. Endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signals from depolarized postsynaptic neurons to presynaptic terminals.Neuron. 2001; 29: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The cultures were kept at 36°C in 5% CO2 for 12–15 days before use. Each neuron of a pair was whole-cell voltage-clamped at room temperature. Compositions of the pipette and external solutions and protocols of stimulation and recording are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Mice were fixed transcardially under deep pentobarbital anesthesia with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and brain sections (50 μm thickness) were prepared. Histology of the brain was examined with NeuroTrace 500/525 green fluorescent Nissl stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For immunohistochemistry, brain sections were incubated with 10% normal donkey serum for 20 min, primary antibodies overnight (for details, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures; all primary antibodies were used at the final concentration of 1 μg/ml), and indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-labeled species-specific secondary antibodies for 2 hr at a dilution of 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA). Images were taken with a fluorescence microscope (AX-70; Olympus Japan) or with a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000; Olympus). For measuring basal 2-AG and anandamide contents in the cerebellum, striatum, and hippocampus, block samples were obtained from mice at 2–6 months of age, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Stimulus-induced production of 2-AG and anandamide by combined DHPG (100 μM) and KCl (20 mM) stimulation was measured in cerebellar slices (250 μm) prepared similarly to those used for electrophysiological experiments. Details of measurements of 2-AG and anandamide contents are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Data are represented as means ± SEM and the numbers of samples are indicated in figures. Statistical significance was assessed by Mann-Whitney U-test for two independent samples and Wilcoxon's signed rank test for paired samples. We thank T.

Two-photon targeted whole-cell recordings of GABAergic neurons in awake mice GABAergic neurons fire action potentials at higher rates than excitatory neurons Highly correlated membrane potential dynamics in GABAergic and excitatory neurons Behavior differentially modulates fast-spiking versus non-fast-spiking GABAergic neurons The neocortex is composed of an intricate network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which interact strongly through local synaptic microcircuits. Action potentials in excitatory cortical neurons evoke release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, driving excitatory postsynaptic potentials in target neurons. Inhibitory cortical neurons release the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) evoking inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Whole-cell recordings in awake animals have begun to shed light on the synaptically driven membrane potential dynamics found in excitatory neurons (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S.

Much less is known about the activity and functional role of identified inhibitory cortical neurons in awake behaving mammals (Fujisawa et al., 2008Fujisawa S. Amarasingham A. Harrison M.T.

Studying awake animals is of crucial importance since differences in brain states have profound influences on cortical dynamics and sensory processing. Here, we focus on the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of mice, which contains a remarkable map of the mystacial vibrissae such that each whisker is individually represented in a well-defined cortical barrel column (Petersen, 2007Petersen C.C.H. The functional organization of the barrel cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 339-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For example, the C2 barrel column is known to process tactile information relating to the C2 whisker. This sensory pathway therefore offers unique opportunities for linking the architecture of specific synaptic microcircuits to cortical sensory processing. When mice explore their environment they actively move their whiskers back and forth at high frequencies in a behavior termed whisking. Active sensory perception and sensorimotor integration are thus prominent features of this system (Kleinfeld et al., 2006Kleinfeld D. Ahissar E. Diamond M.E. Active sensation: insights from the rodent vibrissa sensorimotor system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sensory processing and membrane potential dynamics in the barrel cortex differ dramatically between quiet and active behavioral states (Fanselow and Nicolelis, 1999Fanselow E.E.

During quiet wakefulness (when the mouse is not moving its whiskers) brief deflections of a single whisker evoke large-amplitude sensory responses that propagate across a large part of the sensorimotor cortex, whereas the same stimuli delivered during active whisking evoke small-amplitude and localized sensory responses (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical sensorimotor integration in behaving mice.Neuron. 2007; 56: 907-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, cortical sensory responses therefore appear to be partially suppressed during active states, a phenomenon that was also recently reported for auditory cortex (Otazu et al., 2009Otazu G.H. Tai L.H. Yang Y. Zador A.M. Engaging in an auditory task suppresses responses in auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In order to define the functional operating principles of the neocortical microcircuits during these different brain states, here we investigate the membrane potential dynamics of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the mouse barrel cortex during behavior quantified through high-speed filming of whisker movements. GABAergic inhibition is thought to play a fundamental role in governing the activity of excitatory neurons. We tested this hypothesis in the C2 barrel column of awake head-restrained mice by locally injecting gabazine (a GABAA receptor antagonist) while measuring the membrane potential in a nearby excitatory pyramidal neuron. In order to differentiate excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we studied knockin mice expressing GFP from the GAD67 gene locus, which specifically labels GABAergic neurons (Tamamaki et al., 2003Tamamaki N. Yanagawa Y. Tomioka R. Miyazaki J. Obata K. Kaneko T. Green fluorescent protein expression and colocalization with calretinin, parvalbumin, and somatostatin in the GAD67-GFP knock-in mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 60-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar; see Figure S1 available online). GABAergic synaptic transmission is unaltered in GAD67-GFP mice compared to wild-type (Figure S2). The GABAergic neurons in the GAD67-GFP mice are sufficiently brightly labeled to allow routine high-resolution visualization in awake head-restrained mice through two-photon microscopy (Figure 1). The whole-cell (WC) recording pipette contained a red fluorescent dye (Alexa-594), which diffused into the recorded neurons. Lack of colocalization of green fluorescence (from GFP-expression) with the red fluorescence (from the whole-cell pipette) indicated that the recordings were from excitatory neurons (Figure 1). In agreement with previous studies (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.H. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 608-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, Poulet and Petersen, 2008Poulet J.F.A. Petersen C.C.H.

Sakmann B. Spiking in primary somatosensory cortex during natural whisking in awake head-restrained rats is cell-type specific.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 16446-16450Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), during control periods of quiet wakefulness, excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex fire action potentials at low rates (0.35 ± 0.1 Hz, n = 8; Figure 1). After collecting baseline traces of control spontaneous activity, gabazine (200 μM) was coinjected with red fluorescent dye (Alexa-594) rapidly diffusing over several hundred micrometers within a few seconds. Following gabazine injection, excitatory neurons on average depolarized by 5.1 ± 0.9 mV (n = 8) and action potential firing rates increased by almost an order of magnitude (2.7 ± 0.9 Hz, n = 8). In addition, we noted that excitatory neurons increased burst firing following blockade of GABAA-mediated inhibition. Whereas under control conditions most action potentials in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons occur individually, following blockade of GABAergic inhibition most spikes occurred in bursts of two or more action potentials within 20 ms (control 32% ± 10% of spikes occur in bursts; gabazine 73% ± 7% of spikes occur in bursts). GABAergic synaptic inputs onto excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 barrel cortex of awake mice therefore act to hyperpolarize excitatory neurons, preventing initiation of action potentials and also preventing burst firing of action potentials. In order to understand how GABAergic neurons evoke this inhibition, it is essential to record their activity. We therefore targeted whole-cell recordings to GFP-labeled GABAergic neurons in layer 2/3 of awake head-restrained mice under visual control through two-photon microscopy (Margrie et al., 2003Margrie T.W. Meyer A.H. Caputi A. Monyer H. Hasan M.T. Schaefer A.T. Denk W. Brecht M. Targeted whole-cell recordings in the mammalian brain in vivo.Neuron. 2003; 39: 911-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, Kitamura et al., 2008Kitamura K. Judkewitz B. Kano M. Denk W. Häusser M. Targeted patch-clamp recordings and single-cell electroporation of unlabeled neurons in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar; Figures 2A–2C ). We distinguish between three classes of cortical neurons. Non-GFP-expressing excitatory neurons responded to depolarizing current injection with an adapting firing pattern of broad action potentials (1.06 ± 0.04 ms, mean ± SEM, n = 39; Figures 2A, 2D, and S3). The somatic input resistance of excitatory neurons in layer 2/3 measured in response to hyperpolarizing current during quiet wakefulness was 38 ± 3 MΩ (n = 38; Figure 2E). In response to depolarizing current injection, fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic GFP-expressing neurons (Figures S3 and S4) fired action potentials at very high frequencies with little adaptation and narrow spike waveforms (0.32 ± 0.02 ms, n = 25; Figures 2B and 2D). Input resistance of GABAergic FS neurons was 61 ± 12 MΩ (n = 25; Figure 2E). Other GFP-expressing GABAergic neurons (Figures S3 and S4) fired broader action potentials (0.84 ± 0.03 ms, n = 44; Figures 2C and 2D) at lower frequencies in response to current injection and we term these non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons. The input resistance of GABAergic NFS neurons (112 ± 7 MΩ, n = 39) was significantly higher than that of excitatory or GABAergic FS neurons (Figure 2E). Whereas GABAergic FS neurons correspond to parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons (Figure S4), GABAergic NFS neurons correspond to parvalbumin-negative inhibitory neurons (Figure S4) expressing other markers such as somatostatin, calretinin, or VIP (Figure S5; Gonchar et al., 2007Gonchar Y. Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Multiple distinct subtypes of GABAergic neurons in mouse visual cortex identified by triple immunostaining.Front. Neuroanat. 2007; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a population, the action potential kinetics of GABAergic NFS neurons were significantly different from those of excitatory pyramidal neurons (Figure 2D), but it is important to note that their distributions overlap extensively (Figure S3). Thus an excitatory neuron could not be differentiated from an inhibitory neuron in the neocortex on the basis of action potential waveform alone and, in our experiments, the genetically encoded GFP-label for GABAergic neurons was essential. This may be an important general point considering the wealth of neurophysiological data originating from unidentified neurons. A similar conclusion was recently drawn from extracellular recordings targeted by two-photon microscopy to GFP-positive GABAergic neurons in the primary visual cortex under anesthesia using the same GAD67-GFP knockin mouse as studied here (Liu et al., 2009Liu B.-H. Li P. Li Y.-T. Sun Y.J. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Zhang L.I. Tao H.W. Visual receptive field structure of cortical inhibitory neurons revealed by two-photon imaging guided recording.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10520-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both types of GABAergic neurons were significantly depolarized compared to excitatory neurons during quiet wakefulness (excitatory −58.1 ± 1.2 mV, n = 32; FS −50.6 ± 0.9 mV, n = 20; NFS −52.0 ± 0.8 mV, n = 42; Figure 2F). Action potential threshold, however, was not different between these classes of neurons (excitatory −40.1 ± 1.4 mV, n = 24; FS −41.4 ± 0.9 mV, n = 20; NFS −39.6 ± 0.7 mV, n = 35). Excitatory neurons therefore need to receive a much greater depolarizing input in order to fire an action potential from the mean membrane potential compared to GABAergic neurons, with GABAergic FS neurons on average being closest to threshold. Presumably as a consequence, both types of GABAergic neurons also spontaneously fired action potentials at significantly higher frequencies compared to excitatory neurons during quiet wakefulness (Figure 2G) and notably GABAergic FS neurons fired at an order of magnitude higher rates than excitatory neurons (excitatory 1.1 ± 0.3 Hz, n = 34; FS 11.0 ± 1.9 Hz, n = 20; NFS 2.9 ± 0.6 Hz, n = 43). Extracellular cell-attached recordings showed similar differences in action potential rates comparing excitatory and GABAergic neurons (excitatory 0.9 ± 0.5 Hz, n = 4; FS 13.1 ± 4.6 Hz, n = 7; NFS 4.6 ± 0.9 Hz, n = 8; Figure S6). Since GABAergic neurons form approximately 12% of the total neuronal population in layer 2/3 of the cortical C2 barrel column (Lefort et al., 2009Lefort S. Tomm C. Floyd Sarria J.C. Petersen C.C.H. The excitatory neuronal network of the C2 barrel column in mouse primary somatosensory cortex.Neuron. 2009; 61: 301-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), the overall number of action potentials during quiet wakefulness in GABAergic neurons appears to roughly equal the number of action potentials in excitatory neurons. Sensory processing and membrane potential dynamics of excitatory neurons in the mouse barrel cortex differ dramatically between different whisker-related behaviors, defining “quiet” and “active” brain states (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S.

Petersen C.C.H. Internal brain state regulates membrane potential synchrony in barrel cortex of behaving mice.Nature. 2008; 454: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These brain states are generated internally within the central nervous system and do not depend upon sensory input from the periphery (Poulet and Petersen, 2008Poulet J.F.A. Petersen C.C.H. Internal brain state regulates membrane potential synchrony in barrel cortex of behaving mice.Nature. 2008; 454: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). During quiet wakefulness, we find large-amplitude, slow membrane potential fluctuations in excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Figures 2A–2C). During activity, when the mouse was moving its C2 whisker, the slow oscillation was suppressed in all three types of neurons (Figures 3A–3C , S7, and S8). In other respects, the three classes of neurons behaved in radically different manners. In agreement with previous observations (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.H. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 608-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, Poulet and Petersen, 2008Poulet J.F.A. Petersen C.C.H. Internal brain state regulates membrane potential synchrony in barrel cortex of behaving mice.Nature. 2008; 454: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), excitatory neurons on average depolarized slightly, but significantly, during whisking (quiet −58.1 ± 1.3 mV; whisking −56.4 ± 1.4 mV; n = 21; Figure 3D); reduced membrane potential variance during whisking (quiet 39.5 ± 7.0 μV2; whisking 20.6 ± 4.9 μV2; n = 19; Figure 3E) and on average did not change their mean action potential firing rates (quiet 1.0 ± 0.3 Hz; whisking 1.0 ± 0.4 Hz, n = 25; Figure 3F). During whisking GABAergic FS neurons on average did not change their mean membrane potential (quiet −50.5 ± 1.1 mV; whisking −50.7 ± 1.2 mV; n = 15; Figure 3D), but membrane potential variance was reduced (quiet 38.6 ± 5.0 μV2; whisking 18.2 ± 4.0 μV2; n = 17; Figure 3E) and action potential firing was also markedly reduced (quiet 10.6 ± 2.1 Hz; whisking 4.2 ± 1.4 Hz, n = 16; Figure 3F). On the other hand, during whisking periods, GABAergic NFS neurons on average depolarized significantly (quiet −51.5 ± 0.8 mV; whisking −48.0 ± 1.2 mV; n = 23; Figure 3D); reduced membrane potential variance (quiet 44.0 ± 5.1 μV2; whisking 28.7 ± 5.3 μV2; n = 23; Figure 3E) and increased their action potential firing rates (quiet 2.2 ± 0.4 Hz; whisking 4.5 ± 0.9 Hz, n = 28; Figure 3F). The active brain state during whisking is therefore characterized by a prominent change in the relative functional contributions of different types of GABAergic neurons. During quiet wakefulness GABAergic FS neurons dominate, whereas during active periods, GABAergic NFS cells provide an equally prominent source of inhibition. During active whisking periods, excitatory layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons exhibit fast membrane potential oscillations which are phase-locked to the rapid forward and backward whisker movements (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.H. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 608-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, Poulet and Petersen, 2008Poulet J.F.A. Petersen C.C.H. Internal brain state regulates membrane potential synchrony in barrel cortex of behaving mice.Nature. 2008; 454: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These phase-locked membrane potential oscillations might underlie one mechanism of encoding object locations through sensitizing neurons to fire action potentials in response to object contact at a specific point in the whisking cycle (Fee et al., 1997Fee M.S.

Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1144-1149PubMed Google Scholar, Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009Curtis J.C. Kleinfeld D. Phase-to-rate transformations encode touch in cortical neurons of a scanning sensorimotor system.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and a specific potential role for GABAergic inhibition has been suggested to contribute (Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009Curtis J.C. Kleinfeld D. Phase-to-rate transformations encode touch in cortical neurons of a scanning sensorimotor system.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the membrane potential dynamics of GABAergic neurons with respect to the quantified millisecond-by-millisecond whisker movements. The time of the peak whisker protraction was identified for each cycle of whisker movement. The membrane potential was subsequently averaged from each whisking cycle aligned at the peak of protraction. This analysis was carried out for excitatory neurons, GABAergic FS neurons and GABAergic NFS neurons (Figure 3G). By comparing the protraction-triggered average membrane potential to shuffled traces averaged at randomized times during whisking, we found that about half of the neurons in each of the three classes had a significant phase-locked modulation of the membrane potential with respect to whisking (significant whisking modulation was found in 5 out 12 excitatory neurons; 6 out of 11 GABAergic FS neurons and 7 out of 18 GABAergic NFS neurons). The amplitude and phase of the membrane modulation by whisking varied across recordings, but there were no significant differences comparing excitatory neurons,"

https://openalex.org/W2071141495,"Metastasis is a fatal complication of prostate cancer, but its mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this report, the authors identify a signaling pathway commonly deregulated in human prostate cancer and describe how it can foster both primary growth and metastatic tumor progression. Epigenetic silencing of the RasGAP DAB2IP by EZH2 overexpression results in aberrant activation of Ras signaling, but also of NF-κB. These two events are mediated by different DAB2IP domains and have distinct roles in localized growth and distant dissemination. Metastasis is responsible for the majority of prostate cancer–related deaths; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process. Here we identify an oncogene–tumor suppressor cascade that promotes prostate cancer growth and metastasis by coordinately activating the small GTPase Ras and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Specifically, we show that loss of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) gene DAB2IP induces metastatic prostate cancer in an orthotopic mouse tumor model. Notably, DAB2IP functions as a signaling scaffold that coordinately regulates Ras and NF-κB through distinct domains to promote tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. DAB2IP is suppressed in human prostate cancer, where its expression inversely correlates with tumor grade and predicts prognosis. Moreover, we report that epigenetic silencing of DAB2IP is a key mechanism by which the polycomb-group protein histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 activates Ras and NF-κB and triggers metastasis. These studies define the mechanism by which two major pathways can be simultaneously activated in metastatic prostate cancer and establish EZH2 as a driver of metastasis."

Two innate immune lectins, galectin-4 and galectin-8, are now reported to recognize and kill human blood group antigen–expressing bacteria. The expression of ABO(H) blood group antigens causes deletion of cells that generate self-specific antibodies to these antigens but this deletion limits adaptive immunity toward pathogens bearing cognate blood group antigens. To explore potential defense mechanisms against such pathogens, given these limitations in adaptive immunity, we screened for innate proteins that could recognize human blood group antigens. Here we report that two innate immune lectins, galectin-4 (Gal-4) and Gal-8, which are expressed in the intestinal tract, recognize and kill human blood group antigen–expressing Escherichia coli while failing to alter the viability of other E. coli strains or other Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms both in vitro and in vivo. The killing activity of both Gal-4 and Gal-8 is mediated by their C-terminal domains, occurs rapidly and independently of complement and is accompanied by disruption of membrane integrity. These results demonstrate that innate defense lectins can provide immunity against pathogens that express blood group–like antigens on their surface ( pages 263 –264 )."
https://openalex.org/W2007088406,"Local inhibitory circuits are thought to shape neuronal information processing in the central nervous system, but it remains unclear how specific properties of inhibitory neuronal interactions translate into behavioral performance. In the olfactory bulb, inhibition of mitral/tufted cells via granule cells may contribute to odor discrimination behavior by refining neuronal representations of odors. Here we show that selective deletion of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 in granule cells boosted synaptic Ca(2+) influx, increasing inhibition of mitral cells. On a behavioral level, discrimination of similar odor mixtures was accelerated while leaving learning and memory unaffected. In contrast, selective removal of NMDA receptors in granule cells slowed discrimination of similar odors. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of mitral cells controlled by granule cell glutamate receptors results in fast and accurate discrimination of similar odors. Thus, spatiotemporally defined molecular perturbations of olfactory bulb granule cells directly link stimulus similarity, neuronal processing time, and discrimination behavior to synaptic inhibition."

The pathophysiology of fragile x syndrome.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2007; 8: 109-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). FMRP is a negative regulator of protein translation and while the precise mechanisms and mRNA targets of FMRP are not yet fully enumerated, loss of this protein results in a severely debilitating and complex neurological phenotype. A central feature of Fragile X syndrome is an alteration in sensory processing that manifests in early infancy and progressively worsens through childhood (Baranek et al., 2008Baranek G.T. Roberts J.E. David F.J. Sideris J. Mirrett P.L. Hatton D.D. Bailey Jr., D.B. Developmental trajectories and correlates of sensory processing in young boys with fragile X syndrome.Phys. Occup. Ther. Pediatr. 2008; 28: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similar to the human syndrome, sensory processing deficits are also observed in the mouse model of Fragile X (Fmr1 knockout) (Bakker et al., 1994Bakker C.E. Verheij C. Willemsen R. van der Helm R. Oerlemans F. Vermey M. Bygrave A. Hoogeveen A. Oostra B. Reyniers E.

Fmrp is required for the establishment of the startle response during the critical period of auditory development.Brain Res. 2006; 1110: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, cellular anatomical deficits are observed in the sensory cortex of Fmr1 knockout mice. A preponderance of abnormally long, thin dendritic spines have been reported in pyramidal neurons during early development in the somatosensory cortex (Galvez and Greenough, 2005Galvez R. Greenough W.T. Sequence of abnormal dendritic spine development in primary somatosensory cortex of a mouse model of the fragile X mental retardation syndrome.Am. J. Med. Genet.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5139-5146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and aberrant developmental pruning of the layer IV spiny stellate dendrites has been described in Fmr1 knockout mice (Galvez et al., 2003Galvez R. Gopal A.R. Greenough W.T. Somatosensory cortical barrel dendritic abnormalities in a mouse model of the fragile X mental retardation syndrome.Brain Res. 2003; 971: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite the clear alterations in cellular morphology in Fmr1 knockout mice, it is not known whether the anatomical deficits have an impact on the functional development of excitatory glutamatergic synapses in somatosensory cortex. Somatosensory cortex is organized into topographic maps of the body surface. In rodents, discrete barrel patterns in layer IV somatosensory cortex are a representation of vibrissae on the contralateral snout (Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970Woolsey T.A. Van der Loos H. The structural organization of layer IV in the somatosensory region (SI) of mouse cerebral cortex. The description of a cortical field composed of discrete cytoarchitectonic units.Brain Res. 1970; 17: 205-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar) with functional organization such that neuron clusters in each barrel unit preferentially respond to tactile information from a defined principal whisker (Petersen, 2007Petersen C.C. The functional organization of the barrel cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 339-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Excitatory synapses formed between ascending thalamocortical axons of relay neurons in the ventrobasal (VB) nucleus of the thalamus and layer IV spiny stellate neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex, provide the major sensory input from the periphery to the cortex. Thus, the thalamocortical synaptic connection is the prime mediator of sensory tactile information from the whiskers to the cortex (Feldman and Brecht, 2005Feldman D.E. Brecht M. Map plasticity in somatosensory cortex.Science. 2005; 310: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, Petersen, 2007Petersen C.C. The functional organization of the barrel cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 339-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). During perinatal development in rodents, activity dependent refinement of thalamocortical synapses leads to a stereotypical maturation of glutamatergic signaling (Barth and Malenka, 2001Barth A.L.

A critical period for long-term potentiation at thalamocortical synapses.Nature. 1995; 375: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Thalamocortical synapses express long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) throughout the critical period for plasticity in layer IV, which approximates the first postnatal week in rodents (Crair and Malenka, 1995Crair M.C.

Activity-dependent maturation of excitatory thalamocortical synapses during the critical period results in a well characterized and rapid change in the glutamate receptor type (Crair and Malenka, 1995Crair M.C.

Developmental and activity-dependent regulation of kainate receptors at thalamocortical synapses.Nature. 1999; 400: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The AMPA receptor contribution increases relative to the NMDA receptor contribution (Crair and Malenka, 1995Crair M.C. Malenka R.C. A critical period for long-term potentiation at thalamocortical synapses.Nature. 1995; 375: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and the proportion of NMDA-only silent synapses is reduced (Isaac et al., 1997Isaac J.T. Crair M.C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Silent synapses during development of thalamocortical inputs.Neuron. 1997; 18: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Differences in the biophysical properties of these synaptic receptor types, particularly their divergent deactivation kinetics, shapes the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which contributes to a decrease in latency of synaptically evoked spikes and shortens the window for coincidence between separate inputs (Daw et al., 2006Daw M.I. Bannister N.V. Isaac J.T. Rapid, activity-dependent plasticity in timing precision in neonatal barrel cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4178-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Developmental changes in synaptic glutamate receptors, therefore, contribute to the maturation of cortical circuits and the emergence of temporal coding of sensory signaling in the mature CNS. Here, we tested whether synaptic development and critical period plasticity were disrupted in Fmr1 knockout animals (Fmr1−/y) by following the development of thalamocortical glutamatergic synapses using electrophysiological recording during the perinatal period. We found that the characteristic functional development of this synapse was profoundly altered. Rather than the decrease in the NMDA/AMPA current ratio that occurs in wild-type animals, loss of FMRP leads to a dramatic increase in this ratio between postnatal day 4 and postnatal day 7, with the largest NMDA/AMPA ratio measured just before closure of the normal critical period. This change in the relative proportion of glutamate receptors was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of NMDA-only silent synapses at the end of the first postnatal week. In parallel with the alterations in the development of synaptic glutamate receptors, the temporally restricted period for LTP expression at thalamocortical synapses was disordered in Fmr1−/y mice. Thalamocortical LTP was most robust at the end of the first postnatal week and LTP persisted beyond closure of the customary defined critical period for layer IV plasticity. Synaptic deficits did not translate into gross anatomical abnormalities; neither the patterning of the somatosensory cortex or spine density of layer IV neurons. Interestingly, the critical period for lesion-induced plasticity of the barrel maps was also unaffected in Fmr1 knockout mice, underlining the specific nature of the delay in critical period for synaptic plasticity. These results highlight previously unknown synaptic deficits, and an important developmental delay, in the circuit underlying sensory information processing in Fmr1 knockout mice. Somatosensory cortex undergoes a rapid and dramatic developmental surge in the first 2 postnatal weeks, during which there is a profusion of synaptogenesis and dendritic rearrangement. The critical period for plasticity in layer IV occurs during the first postnatal week and is defined by the expression of robust synaptic plasticity and anatomical map plasticity (Daw et al., 2007Daw M.I. Scott H.L. Isaac J.T. Developmental synaptic plasticity at the thalamocortical input to barrel cortex: Mechanisms and roles.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 34: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Previous work in somatosensory cortex of adult rats demonstrated elevated FMRP expression after whisker stimulation, suggesting that FMRP expression is enhanced by activity-dependent translation of FMRP (Todd and Mack, 2000Todd P.K. Mack K.J. Sensory stimulation increases cortical expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein in vivo.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Todd et al., 2003Todd P.K. Malter J.S. Mack K.J. Whisker stimulation-dependent translation of FMRP in the barrel cortex requires activation of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 110: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the expression pattern of FMRP in developing somatosensory cortex is not known. Using immunohistochemical analysis of sections from layer IV somatosensory cortex, FMRP was detected in both coronal and tangential sections from P4 mice (Figures 1Ai and 1Aii). Intense staining was observed at P7 through to P14 (Figures 1Bi and 1Bii), while at later developmental times (P21), the relative intensity of FMRP staining was reduced compared to that at P7 (Figure 1D). Western blot analysis of homogenates from barrel cortex of mice taken at several postnatal ages, confirmed the expression of FMRP in this region during perinatal development (see Figure S1A available online), and the specificity of the antibody was confirmed by the complete loss of staining in Fmr1−/y mice (Figures S1B and S1C). From these results, it is clear that FMRP is expressed in layer IV during the critical period, with peak expression occurring during the surge in plasticity, synaptogenesis, and dendritic rearrangement during the first 2 postnatal weeks (Daw et al., 2007Daw M.I. Scott H.L. Isaac J.T. Developmental synaptic plasticity at the thalamocortical input to barrel cortex: Mechanisms and roles.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 34: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the discrete laminar staining in barrel sections suggests FMRP expression in layer IV neurons, it is possible that FMRP is expressed in thalamic axons and terminals present in layer IV. Indeed, FMRP is found in axons of cultured hippocampal neurons where it could assist in regulating axon pathfinding (Antar et al., 2006Antar L.N. Li C. Zhang H. Carroll R.C. Bassell G.J. Local functions for FMRP in axon growth cone motility and activity-dependent regulation of filopodia and spine synapses.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 32: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Consequently, immunoelectron microscopy was performed on sections from P7 mice (Figures 1E and 1F) to determine the subcellular distribution of FMRP in layer IV. DAB immunoreactivity was localized in the cytoplasm and dendritic compartment of neurons in layer IV (Figure 1F). Moreover, immunoreactivity was observed in the postsynaptic region of asymmetric synapses in layer IV (Figures 1Ei–1Eiii), indicating that FMRP is localized close to excitatory synapses in layer IV neurons. Using this subcellular level analysis, labeling of presynaptic structures was not detected at this developmental age (P7). These results demonstrate that FMRP is expressed in layer IV neurons in the somatosensory cortex during the critical period for plasticity. Thalamocortical afferents to layer IV provide the main sensory input to the cortex via excitatory synaptic connections to stellate neurons and local circuit interneurons. To determine whether thalamocortical synapses develop normally in Fmr1 knockout mice, voltage-clamp recordings were made from spiny stellate neurons (Figure 2A ) at each postnatal day starting at postnatal day 4. In P4 wild-type mice (Fmr1+/y), the NMDA component of synaptic transmission was large relative to the AMPA component, resulting in an NMDA/AMPA ratio (NA ratio) of 1.5 ± 0.2 (n = 13; Figure 2B) as previously reported (Crair and Malenka, 1995Crair M.C. Malenka R.C. A critical period for long-term potentiation at thalamocortical synapses.Nature. 1995; 375: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, the NA ratio at P4 in Fmr1−/y mice was significantly lower (0.5 ± 0.1, n = 13, p = 0.0003; Figure 2C). Recordings made on each subsequent postnatal day in Fmr1+/y mice showed a clear progressive decrease in the NA ratio (P5: 0.9 ± 0.2, n = 9; P6: 0.6 ± 0.1, n = 16), until at closure of the critical period for plasticity (P7), the measured NA ratio was 0.5 ± 0.1 (n = 18). Whereas the NA ratio in recordings from Fmr1−/y mice increased between P4 and P7 (P5: 0.8 ± 0.2, n = 10, p > 0.05; P6: 1.1 ± 0.1, n = 16, p = 0.006) with a maximum ratio of 1.5 ± 0.2 (n = 18, p = 0.0007) at the close of the critical period for wild-type animals (Figure 2C). At postnatal days beyond P7, the NA ratio in Fmr1−/y returned back to levels indistinguishable from those observed in wild-type littermates (P10-P14 NA ratio: Fmr1+/y, 0.6 ± 0.1, n = 39; Fmr1−/y, 0.8 ± 0.1, n = 46 p > 0.05 and at > P22 NA ratio: Fmr1+/y, 0.5 ± 0.1, n = 9; Fmr1−/y 0.6 ± 0.1, n = 16, p > 0.05). The alterations in the relative contribution of NMDA and AMPA receptors at developing thalamocortical synapses in Fmr1−/y mice could represent a change in the complement of glutamate receptors at individual synapses or an alteration in the proportion of silent synapses containing only NMDA receptors (Isaac et al., 1997Isaac J.T.

Silent synapses during development of thalamocortical inputs.Neuron. 1997; 18: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) or combined alterations in both these synaptic parameters. Prior studies have reported region-specific alterations in AMPA receptor protein expression in Fmr1 knockout mice (Li et al., 2002Li J. Pelletier M.R. Perez Velazquez J.L. Carlen P.L.

Chem. 2009; 284: 25479-25487Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); however, it is not known whether AMPA and NMDA receptor expression is altered in the somatosensory cortex during the critical period for plasticity. To directly address this question, sections containing layer IV were isolated and the barrel cortex specifically microdissected to enrich for layer IV neurons. Analysis of protein expression in the synaptoneurosome fraction from tissue during critical period development (P7) demonstrated a selective, significant increase in the expression of NMDA receptor (NR1) protein in synaptic membranes from Fmr1 knockout mice (117% ± 7%, p = 0.03, n = 3; Figure 3A ). No significant alteration in GluR1 expression was detected. PSD-95, an important synaptic protein whose mRNA interacts with, and is stabilized by, FMRP (Zalfa et al., 2007Zalfa F. Eleuteri B. Dickson K.S. Mercaldo V. De Rubeis S. di Penta A. Tabolacci E. Chiurazzi P. Neri G. Grant S.G. Bagni C. A new function for the fragile X mental retardation protein in regulation of PSD-95 mRNA stability.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), appeared to be upregulated although a statistically significant threshold was not reached (114% ± 10% p = 0.06, n = 3; Figure 3A). Similarly, analysis of whole tissue homogenate only uncovered a significant increase in NR1 protein levels in Fmr1−/y mice at P7 (128% ± 10%, p = 0.03, n = 3). In contrast, there was no significant difference in NR1, GluR1 or PSD95 protein in synaptic membranes of tissue taken from layer IV of Fmr1−/y or Fmr1+/y after closure of the critical period (P14) (Figure 3B). These results suggest that total NR1 expression in layer IV synapses is enhanced at P7 in Fmr1 knockout mice; nevertheless, it does not discriminate between increases in NMDA receptors at individual synapses, or increases in the number of NMDA-only silent synapses. To address any differences in glutamate receptor numbers at developing thalamocortical synapses, evoked AMPA receptor mediated EPSCs were recorded while exchanging the Ca2+-containing extracellular solution with one that contained 6 mM strontium (Sr2+). Synaptic release is desynchronized in the presence of Sr2+ and quantal EPSCs (Sr2+-mEPSCs) are observed for several hundreds of milliseconds after stimulation of the inputs (Bannister et al., 2005Bannister N.J. Benke T.A. Mellor J. Scott H. Gürdal E. Crabtree J.W. Isaac J.T. Developmental changes in AMPA and kainate receptor-mediated quantal transmission at thalamocortical synapses in the barrel cortex.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5259-5271Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Comparison between mice of each genotype during the critical period found no significant difference in AMPA Sr2+-mEPSC amplitudes (Fmr1+/y: 10.2 ± 0.8 pA, n = 24; Fmr1−/y: 9.7 ± 0.5, n = 25 p > 0.05, K-S test; Figure 3C). In the same manner, the amplitude of the isolated NMDA receptor mediated component of Sr2+-mEPSCs was measured. Again, recordings were made during critical period development (see Experimental Procedures). No significant differences were found in the quantal NMDA content of individual layer IV thalamocortical synapses during the critical period between Fmr1−/y mice and littermate controls (Fmr1+/y: 6.3 ± 0.2 pA, n = 21; Fmr1−/y: 6.9 ± 0.4, n = 17, p > 0.05, K-S test; Figure 3D). Therefore, the quantal amplitude of both the AMPA and NMDA components at developing thalamocortical synapses is unaltered during early postnatal development in Fmr1 knockout mice, while there is a significant increase in the expression of synaptic NR1 protein in tissue from layer IV from Fmr1−/y animals. To determine whether the elevated NA ratio and increase in NR1 protein expression in synaptic membranes was due to an elevation in the abundance of NMDA-only silent synapses, thalamocortical EPSCs were recorded from mice during the critical period (P7), while stimulating just a few inputs to the layer IV neurons using minimal stimulation techniques. Two example experiments are illustrated in Figures 4A and 4B . Under these conditions, AMPA mediated EPSCs or failures are observed in successive trials when the neuron is voltage clamped at relatively hyperpolarized potentials (−70 mV). Depolarizing the neuron to +40 mV produces an outward, mixed AMPA, NMDA EPSC; measurement of the outward current 60 ms after the onset allows analysis of the largely NMDA-mediated component (Marie et al., 2005Marie H. Morishita W. Yu X. Calakos N. Malenka R.C. Generation of silent synapses by acute in vivo expression of CaMKIV and CREB.Neuron. 2005; 45: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, the fraction of silent synapses can be determined by analysis of the failure rate at −70 mV and the failure rate at +40 mV (Isaac et al., 1997Isaac J.T. Crair M.C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Silent synapses during development of thalamocortical inputs.Neuron. 1997; 18: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures). In Fmr1+/y mice there was no significant difference in the percentage of EPSC failures at −70mV compared to +40mV (failures −70mV: 31% ± 4.7%; failures at +40mV: 35% ± 6.8%, n = 8, p > 0.05), similar to previous reports at thalamocortical synapses at the close of the critical period (Isaac et al., 1997Isaac J.T. Crair M.C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Silent synapses during development of thalamocortical inputs.Neuron. 1997; 18: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar; Figure 4C). In contrast, the number of failures in Fmr1−/y mice at +40 mV was significantly lower than the failures at −70 mV, indicating that there was a significant proportion of NMDA-only synapses remaining at the closure of the customary critical period (failures −70 mV: 55% ± 7.4%; failures at +40 mV: 37% ± 7.9%, n = 7, p < 0.05; Figure 4D). Representing these failure rates as a failure ratio (percent failures −70 mV/percent failures +40 mV) allows a direct assessment of the fraction of silent synapses between each genotype where a failure ratio of 1.0 indicates few silent synapses and a larger ratio signifies a greater fraction of NMDA-only synapses. The failure ratio in wild-type mice was close to 1.0 (0.9 ± 0.2; Figure 4E) suggesting that there were few, if any, silent thalamocortical synapses remaining at P7 in Fmr1+/y mice. In contrast, a relatively high failure ratio was observed in Fmr1−/y mice (1.9 ± 0.4) supporting the conclusion that there are a considerably higher fraction of NMDA-only synapses in these mice (Figure 4E). In the first week of postnatal development, the NR2B subunit is a prominent constituent of the NMDA receptor complex in layer IV synapses, but it is rapidly downregulated playing a reduced role in synaptic NMDA receptors at the closure of the critical period (Barth and Malenka, 2001Barth A.L. Malenka R.C. NMDAR EPSC kinetics do not regulate the critical period for LTP at thalamocortical synapses.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 235-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The developmental profile of the NR2B receptor subunit in Fmr1−/y mice was monitored by recording NMDA receptor mediated synaptic currents and determining the relative sensitivity to the NR2B selective antagonist, ifenprodil (3 μM) at the beginning, end, and after closure of the critical period. At postnatal day 4, NMDA receptor EPSCs in wild-type mice were inhibited 66% ± 4.4%, (n = 7), which was not different from the ifenprodil inhibition of synaptic NMDA receptors in Fmr1−/y mice (70% ± 3.6%, n = 10 p > 0.05; Figures 5A and 5B ). Similarly at P7 and P10, the inhibition of NMDA receptors mice was not significantly different between Fmr1+/y and Fmr1−/y (at P7: Fmr1+/y: 57% ± 5.8%, n = 11; Fmr1−/y 49% ± 5.7%, n = 11 p > 0.05; at P10: Fmr1+/y: 31% ± 7.0%, n = 10; Fmr1−/y 24% ± 5.4%, n = 11 p > 0.05; Figures 5A and 5B). Therefore despite an altered developmental profile of excitatory thalamocortical synapses during the critical period for plasticity, the normal developmental switch in NMDA receptor stoichiometry from NR2B to NR2A is maintained in Fmr1−/y mice. Alterations in the development of glutamatergic synapses may be reflected in changes in the density of synaptic connections or spines. A previous study found small but significant increases in the number of spines in layer V somatosensory neurons at P7 (Nimchinsky et al., 2001Nimchinsky E.A. Oberlander A.M. Svoboda K. Abnormal development of dendritic spines in FMR1 knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5139-5146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In layer IV neurons nascent spines are observed at P7 as dendritic protrusions. Analysis of stellate neuron dendritic protrusions using Golgi stained sections did not uncover any difference in density of putative spines between genotypes at P7 (Figures 5Ci–5Ciii). Moreover, analysis after closure of the critical period at P14 produced similar results, with no observed changes in spine density in Fmr1 knockout mice compared to littermate controls (Figure 5Civ). Long-term potentiation at developing thalamocortical synapses is dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors, and is only present during the critical period when topographical rearrangements of somatosensory cortex can be induced by sensory perturbations (Crair and Malenka, 1995Crair M.C. Malenka R.C. A critical period for long-term potentiation at thalamocortical synapses.Nature. 1995; 375: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Using perforated patch whole-cell recording of spiny stellate neurons at each postnatal day between P3 and P10, LTP was induced using a pairing protocol (Crair and Malenka, 1995Crair M.C.

https://openalex.org/W2084135119,"Interneurons in the cerebral cortex regulate cortical functions through the actions of distinct subgroups that express parvalbumin, somatostatin, or calretinin. The genesis of the first two subgroups requires the expression of NKX2.1, which is maintained by SHH signaling during neurogenesis. In this paper, we report that mosaic elimination in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) of Smo, a key effector of SHH signaling, reveals that MGE progenitors retain a remarkable degree of plasticity during the neurogenic period. SHH signaling prevents the upregulation of GSX2 and conversion of some MGE progenitors to a caudal ganglionic eminence-like, bipolar calretinin-expressing cell fate that is promoted by GSX2. In addition, a higher level of SHH signaling promotes the generation of the somatostatin-expressing interneuron at the expense of parvalbumin-expressing subgroup.

Recent studies have suggested diverse mechanisms as underlying demyelination, including a subset of lesions induced by an interaction between metabolic insult to oligodendrocytes and inflammatory mediators. For mice of susceptible strains, cuprizone feeding results in oligodendrocyte cell loss and demyelination of the corpus callosum. Remyelination ensues and has been extensively studied. Cuprizone-induced demyelination remains incompletely characterized. We found that mice lacking the type 2 CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR2) were relatively resistant to cuprizone-induced demyelination and that circulating CXCR2-positive neutrophils were important for cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our findings support a two-hit process of cuprizone-induced demyelination, supporting the idea that multiple sclerosis pathogenesis features extensive oligodendrocyte cell loss. These data suggest that cuprizone-induced demyelination is useful for modeling certain aspects of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061822901,"Regulated protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a central role in building synaptic connections, yet little is known about either which specific UPS components are involved or UPS targets in neurons. We report that inhibiting the UPS in developing Xenopus retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with a dominant-negative ubiquitin mutant decreases terminal branching in the tectum but does not affect long-range navigation to the tectum. We identify Nedd4 as a prominently expressed E3 ligase in RGC axon growth cones and show that disrupting its function severely inhibits terminal branching. We further demonstrate that PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, is a key downstream target of Nedd4: not only does Nedd4 regulate PTEN levels in RGC growth cones, but also, the decrease of PTEN rescues the branching defect caused by Nedd4 inhibition. Together our data suggest that Nedd4-regulated PTEN is a key regulator of terminal arborization in vivo."

In analyses of conventional and conditional Nedd4-1-deficient mice, we found that Nedd4-1 plays a critical role in dendrite formation. Nedd4-1, the serine/threonine kinase TNIK, and Rap2A form a complex that controls Nedd4-1-mediated ubiquitination of Rap2A. Ubiquitination by Nedd4-1 inhibits Rap2A function, which reduces the activity of Rap2 effector kinases of the TNIK family and promotes dendrite growth.

Dendrite size and complexity of a given neuron are correlated with the numbers of innervating axons and functional synapses (Hume and Purves, 1981Hume R.I. Purves D.

The dendritic complexity and innervation of submandibular neurons in five species of mammals.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1760-1768PubMed Google Scholar), and the dendrite structure might even directly influence synaptogenesis and synapse elimination (Kwon et al., 2006Kwon C.H. Luikart B.W. Powell C.M. Zhou J. Matheny S.A. Zhang W. Li Y. Baker S.J. Parada L.F.

Because dendrites play a critical role in defining the signal input characteristics of neurons, their structure and complexity as well as the processes that control their growth are of profound importance for the establishment of neuronal networks (Parrish et al., 2007Parrish J.Z.

Neurosci. 2008; 9: 206-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Multiple neuronal transmembrane cell-surface proteins, including Dscam, Neuropilins, Notch, or Neurotrophin receptors, regulate the morphology of dendrites in a differential manner (Parrish et al., 2007Parrish J.Z.

Neurosci. 2007; 30: 399-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and numerous neuronal proteins control more subtle aspects of dendrite morphology such as spine formation and stability. The fact that different cell-surface proteins control distinct aspects of dendrite morphogenesis implies that distinct intracellular signal transduction cascades exist that translate individual extracellular signals into specific morphogenic changes during dendrite formation. Transcription factors such as Neurogenin 2 or CREB, the tyrosine kinase Fyn, CaMKs, or small GTPases of the Rho and Ras families are likely components of such signaling cascades (Hand et al., 2005Hand R.

However, it is largely unknown how these signaling pathways are coordinated to determine specific morphological features of dendrites during different phases of neuronal network formation. In the present study, we discovered a signaling pathway that controls dendrite growth. It involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1, which acts as an essential positive regulator of dendrite development and operates by mono- or diubiquitination of Rap2A and downstream modulation of Rap2A effector kinases of the TNIK family. Nedd4-1 mRNA and protein are strongly and ubiquitously expressed in the newborn brain and developmentally downregulated after synapse formation has peaked and dendrite development is throttled (see Figure S1 available online), indicating that Nedd4-1 is particularly important in the brain during gestation and early postnatal development. In the adult mouse brain, Nedd4-1 is slightly enriched in ER- and Golgi membranes (Figure S1F). We generated Nedd4-1 knockout (KO) mice in which Nedd4-1 protein expression is abolished (Figures S2A–S2E). Although Nedd4-1 protein expression was slightly reduced in heterozygous KOs (Figure S2E), these were viable and showed no obvious phenotypic changes. Offspring of heterozygous interbreedings showed the predicted Mendelian frequency of homozygous KO, heterozygous KO, and wild-type (WT) progeny until embryonic day E16.5 (20%:52%:28%), after which the number of homozygous KOs decreased to 3% at E18.5 and 0% at birth, indicating that homozygous KOs die during late gestation. This lethality is likely due to the loss of Nedd4-1 from essential nonneuronal organs. Indeed, starting at E11.5, KO embryos showed a retarded development (Figure S2F), and almost 50% of KOs had subcutaneous bleedings (Figure S2F), indicating an involvement of Nedd4-1 in vasculogenesis or angiogenesis. We did not observe any signs of apoptosis in Nedd4-1-KOs (data not shown). Among the reported conventional KO mice lacking ubiquitously expressed E3 ubiquitin ligases (Bloom et al., 2007Bloom A.J.

To study the function of Nedd4-1 during nerve cell development, we analyzed the morphology of individual cortical neurons from Nedd4-1-KO and WT brains in autaptic cultures (Bekkers and Stevens, 1991Bekkers J.M. Stevens C.F. Excitatory and inhibitory autaptic currents in isolated hippocampal neurons maintained in cell culture.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) by plating and culturing identical numbers of KO and WT cells (6000 cells per 35 mm2) on astrocyte islands. The numbers of surviving neurons were not significantly different between the genotypes at day 10 in vitro (DIV10) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; p = 0.944) (Table S1), indicating that Nedd4-1 KO does not affect neuron survival. However, KO neurons were smaller than WT cells. To examine if the smaller size of KO neurons is due to impaired dendrite development, we fixed neurons at DIV10 and immunostained them for MAP2. KO neurons were characterized by more immature dendrites as compared with WT cells (Figure 1A ). We quantified this effect by Sholl analysis, where dendrites crossing concentric circles drawn at 7.5 μm intervals around neurons are counted (Sholl, 1953Sholl D.A. Dendritic organization in the neurons of the visual and motor cortices of the cat.J. Anat. 1953; 87: 387-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). WT DIV10 neurons showed the highest number of crossings at a 30 μm distance from the cell body (9.36 ± 0.86, n = 25) while KO neurons showed a peak at 22.5 μm and overall less crossing dendrites (5.87 ± 0.41, n = 38) (Figure 1B). Comparison of numbers of crossing dendrites at a 22.5 μm distance from cell bodies (p < 0.001) and numbers of dendritic tips, representing the number of all distal dendrites and dendrite complexity (p = 0.017) (Jaworski et al., 2005Jaworski J. Spangler S. Seeburg D.P. Hoogenraad C.C. Sheng M. Control of dendritic arborization by the phosphoinositide-3′-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11300-11312Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), yielded significantly lower values for KO neurons (Figures 1C and 1D and Table S1). However, neither the numbers of primary dendrites emerging from cell bodies at DIV10 (p = 0.138) (Figure 1E and Table S1) nor neurite lengths, axon numbers, or total neurite numbers at DIV3 (Figure S3 and Table S1; p > 0.05) were different between WT and KO neurons. These results show that Nedd4-1 is dispensable during the acquisition of neuronal cell polarity and initial neuritogenesis but required for subsequent dendrite extension and arborization. To test if the dendrite arborization defect in KO neurons is a specific consequence of Nedd4-1 loss, we tried to rescue this phenotype by re-expressing EGFP-tagged Nedd4-1 in KO cells (Figures 1F–1H). We infected WT and KO neurons 24 hr after plating on astrocyte microislands with lentiviruses expressing either EGFP-Nedd4-1 or, as a negative control, EGFP fused to the catalytically inactive point mutant of Nedd4-1 [EGFP-Nedd4-1(C/S)], and fixed cells at DIV10, when EGFP signals were clearly detectable. Upon expression of EGFP-Nedd4-1(C/S) in KO neurons, the dendrite complexity was similar to that of non-infected KO cells (compare Figures 1A and 1F). In contrast, re-expression of EGFP-Nedd4-1 in KO neurons caused a significant increase in the complexity and length of dendrites, which were similar to those in WT cells expressing the negative control construct EGFP-Nedd4-1(C/S) (Figures 1F–1H and Table S2; p < 0.001). Sholl analysis revealed that the reintroduction of recombinant Nedd4-1 into KO cells restored the complexity of dendrites (Figure 1G). Overexpression of recombinant Nedd4-1 in WT neurons showed little effect on dendrite complexity (Figures 1F–1H and Table S2; p > 0.05), most likely because endogenous Nedd4-1 expression in WT cells is sufficiently high to reach saturation. Corresponding results were obtained when we used EGFP fused to the N-terminus of Nedd4-1 [EGFP-Nedd4-1(1-268)] as a negative control (Table S2), which itself had no catalytic activity or dominant effects (Figure S5A). These results show that the dendrite morphology defect in KO neurons is a specific consequence of Nedd4-1 loss and that the enzymatic activity of Nedd4-1 is crucial for regulation of dendrite development. To study the function of Nedd4-1 in vivo, we generated a floxed Nedd4-1 mutant mouse line (Figure S2B). Overexpression of Cre in primary neurons prepared from Nedd4-1flox/flox mice eliminated Nedd4-1 protein expression (Figure S2E). The Nedd4-1flox/flox line was crossed with a NEX-Cre mouse line expressing Cre recombinase in postmitotic cerebral and hippocampal glutamatergic neurons (Goebbels et al., 2006Goebbels S. Bormuth I. Bode U. Hermanson O. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Genetic targeting of principal neurons in neocortex and hippocampus of NEX-Cre mice.Genesis. 2006; 44: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). NEX-Cre;Nedd4-1flox/flox mice were viable and fertile but had a smaller cerebrum than controls, while the size of the cerebellum, where Cre recombinase is expressed only in a minor fraction of neurons, was normal (Figures 2A and 2B ). Brains were isolated from NEX-Cre;Nedd4-1flox/flox mice at 2–8 months after birth and Golgi stained in order to study dendrite complexity. The thickness of the cerebral cortex was reduced in NEX-Cre;Nedd4-1flox/flox mice (Figure 2C). Upon examination of pyramidal cells in stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 region of hippocampus, we found that the extent and branching of apical dendrites were significantly reduced in NEX-Cre;Nedd4-1flox/flox mice (p < 0.0001) (Figures 2D–2F and Table S1). These results show that Nedd4-1 is a critical regulator of dendrite arborization in vivo and determines the neurite arborization of mature neurons. To determine the effects of Nedd4-1 KO on synaptic transmission, we studied glutamatergic autaptic cortical neurons from WT, heterozygous KO, and homozygous KO littermate embryos using electrophysiological methods. Because data obtained from WT and heterozygous KO neurons were indistinguishable, we pooled them and used them as the WT control reference. We first recorded resting membrane potentials and input membrane resistances, which did not differ between KO and WT cells (Figures S3E and S3F and Table S3; p > 0.1). Next, we quantified the delay between stimulus-onset and glutamate-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) (stimulus-peak time), which was almost identical in WT and KO cells (Table S3; Student's t test, p > 0.1). Paired-pulse response characteristics, which we assessed using two action potentials at a 100 ms interval, were not significantly different between neurons of the two groups (WT, 0.96 ± 0.030, n = 91; KO, 0.89 ± 0.024, n = 68; Student's t test, p > 0.05). These results indicate that neuronal viability and presynaptic release probability are not affected by Nedd4-1 KO. EPSC amplitudes in KO neurons were reduced to about 62% of control values (Figures 3A and 3B and Table S3; p < 0.001). This was paralleled by a similar reduction in the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool in KO neurons (Figures 3C and 3D and Table S3; p < 0.005), which we determined by measuring transmitter release in response to hypertonic sucrose buffer (Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Definition of the readily releasable pool of vesicles at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Such phenotypic changes in synaptic transmission can be caused by a reduction of the number of synapses formed by a given mutant neuron, which would be expected based on our morphological analysis (Figure 1), or by functional defects at the level of individual synapses. To distinguish these possibilities, we analyzed miniature EPSCs (mEPSC) originating from spontaneous single synaptic vesicle fusion events and postsynaptic detection of released transmitter. mEPSC amplitudes were not different between control and KO neurons, while the frequency of mEPSCs in KO neurons was reduced to 55% of control values (Figures 3E–3G and Table S3; amplitudes, p > 0.05; frequencies, p < 0.005). The fact that mEPSC amplitudes were similar in control and KO neurons indicates that the numbers and density of postsynaptic glutamate receptors at existing synapses are normal in KO cells. That the cell-surface density of glutamate receptors is indeed unaltered in KO cells was verified by experiments, in which we applied kainic acid to cultured neurons in order to stimulate all cell surface glutamate receptors. Kainic acid-induced currents did not differ significantly between control and KO neurons (Figure 3H and Table S3; p > 0.05). The tendency toward lower kainic acid-induced currents in KO neurons is likely due to the reduced cell surface area, which is caused by the impaired development of dendrites. The fact that AMPA receptor densities at existing synapses are unaltered in KO neurons indicates that AMPA receptor exo- and endocytosis, which can in principle be modulated by ubiquitination (Guo and Wang, 2007Guo L. Wang Y. Glutamate stimulates glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome system to regulate surface expression of GluR2.Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), are normal upon Nedd4-1 KO. Consequently, the reduced evoked EPSC amplitudes and mEPSC frequencies in KO neurons are most likely due to a reduction in the numbers of functionally normal synapses, as is expected based on the dendritogenesis defect in KO cells (Figure 1). To test this, we measured synapse numbers in autaptic WT and KO neurons at DIV10 after immunostaining for the synapse markers Synapsin and Bassoon (Figure 4). The fluorescence intensities of synapses stained for Synapsin did not differ between KO and WT cells (Figure 4A). However, the total number of Synapsin-positive presynaptic puncta was reduced in KO cells. Quantification of Synapsin and Bassoon double positive synaptic puncta showed that KO neurons had 47% less synapses than WT controls (Figure 4B and Table S3; p < 0.001), which is in accord with the reduced evoked EPSC amplitudes and mEPSC frequencies in KO cells (Figures 3A–3G and Table S3). Re-expression of recombinant EGFP-Nedd4-1 restored synapse numbers and function in autaptic KO neurons (Figure S4 and Table S2). Importantly, the synapse density per dendrite length (Figures S3G and S3H and Table S3), presynaptic maturation of synapses (Table S3), and spatial matching of pre- and postsynapses (Figures S3I and S3J) were normal in KO neurons. Taken together, these results show that Nedd4-1 loss causes impaired dendrite development, which in turn leads to a reduction in the number of otherwise normal synapses. However, we cannot exclude that subtle synaptic defects in KO cells went undetected in our analyses. Multiple mammalian proteins were identified as Nedd4-1 substrates, including VEGF-R2, CNrasGEF, ENaC, and PTEN (Murdaca et al., 2004Murdaca J. Treins C. Monthouel-Kartmann M.N. Pontier-Bres R.

Among these substrates, PTEN could in principle be relevant for the present findings (Jaworski et al., 2005Jaworski J. Spangler S. Seeburg D.P. Hoogenraad C.C. Sheng M.

Landry T. Kawabe H. Neeb A. Lu C. Brose N. Stambolic V. Rotin D. The ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 is dispensable for the regulation of PTEN stability and localization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 8585-8590Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To identify Nedd4-1 targets responsible for the KO phenotype, we performed affinity chromatography using the Nedd4-1 WW domains as affinity matrix and a Triton X-100 rat brain synaptosome extract as the source of Nedd4-1 targets. We identified 15 proteins from 12 protein bands that bound to the Nedd4-1 affinity column (Figure 5A and Table S4). Among these, our interest was attracted by TNIK. TNIK was originally identified as a Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (Fu et al., 1999Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. TNIK, a novel member of the germinal center kinase family that activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway and regulates the cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), is part of a protein family that also contains NIK (Nck-interacting kinase) and MINK (misshapen/NIKs-related kinase) (Figure S5B) (Dan et al., 2000Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kobayashi T. Yamashita-Suzuki K. Fukagaya Y. Kajikawa E. Kimura W.K. Nakashima T.M. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. et al.Molecular cloning of MINK, a novel member of mammalian GCK family kinases, which is up-regulated during postnatal mouse cerebral development.FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 19-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and was shown to regulate actin dynamics as an effector of the small GTPase Rap2 (Taira et al., 2004Taira K. Umikawa M. Takei K. Myagmar B.E. Shinzato M. Machida N. Uezato H. Nonaka S. Kariya K. The Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase as a putative effector of Rap2 to regulate actin cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49488-49496Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Given that TNIK binds to the WW domains of Nedd4-1 and regulates actin dynamics in conjunction with Rap2, we focused our analysis on the interaction among Nedd4-1, TNIK, and Rap2, whose perturbation might be the cause for the dendritogenesis defects seen in Nedd4-1-KO neurons. Western blotting of eluates from GST-Nedd4-1 beads using anti-TNIK and anti-Rap2 antibodies showed that TNIK and Rap2 are present in the affinity-purified material, indicating that Nedd4-1, TNIK, and Rap2 may form a complex (Figure 5B). To detect complex formation among Nedd4-1, TNIK, and Rap2, a mouse brain membrane fraction was incubated with a thiol-cleavable membrane-permeable crosslinker before immunoprecipitation with an anti-Nedd4-1 antibody. Under these conditions, but not without crosslinking (not shown), TNIK and Rap2 were coimmunoprecipitated with Nedd4-1 (Figure 5C). In addition, Rap2A and TNIK are enriched and colocalized with Nedd4-1 in the perinuclear region of neurons, and the three proteins partially cosegregate into ER and Golgi enriched fractions upon subcellular fractionation of brain tissue (Figures S1E and S1F). These data show that Nedd4-1, TNIK, and Rap2 partially colocalize in neurons and form a ternary complex. We mapped the Nedd4-1-binding region of TNIK to the central part (Figures S5C and S5D), which is only moderately conserved in MINK (53% identity) and NIK (57% identity), while the kinase and citron-homology (CNH) domains are very similar in all family members (90%–92% identity). The isoform specificity of Nedd4-1 interactions with TNIK, MINK, and NIK was studied by affinity pull-down assays (Figure S5B). We found that the affinity of NIK to GST-Nedd4-1 was as strong as that of TNIK, while MINK binding to GST-Nedd4-1 was barely detectable. Considering that Rap2 binds the C terminus of TNIK and Nedd4-1 the central linker domain, TNIK might mediate an indirect interaction between Nedd4-1 and Rap2 (Figure S5E). To test this, lysates of HEK293FT (HEK) cells expressing Myc-tagged dominant-active mutant Rap2A (DA-G12V) alone or Myc-tagged Rap2A (DA-G12V) together with the HA-tagged kinase domain deletion mutant (delta KD) of TNIK, which contains the Rap2- and Nedd4-1-binding regions, were loaded onto GST-Nedd4-1-coupled beads (Figure 5D). We found that the interaction of Myc-Rap2A (DA-G12V) with GST-Nedd4-1 was dependent on HA-TNIK (delta KD) (lanes 4 and 6 in Figure 5D) while HA-TNIK (delta KD) interacted with GST-Nedd4-1 in a Myc-Rap2A (G12V)-independent manner (Figure S5D). The slight interaction between Myc-Rap2 (DA-G12V) and GST-Nedd4-1 in the absence of HA-TNIK (delta KD) is likely mediated by endogenous TNIK in HEK cells (lane 4 in Figure 5D). Next, we tested if the interaction with Nedd4-1 leads to ubiquitination of TNIK or Rap2. Expression vectors for EGFP-tagged full-length Nedd4-1, His6-tagged ubiquitin, and Myc-tagged WT Rap2A, DA-G12V Rap2A, or the dominant-negative mutant (DN-S17N) Rap2A were cotransfected in HEK cells, and Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using anti-Myc antibodies. Ubiquitination of immunoprecipitated protein was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. Immunoprecipitates from Rap2A (WT) and Rap2A (DA-G12V), but not Rap2A (DN-S17N), expressing HEK cells showed a ladder of protein bands that were detected by an anti-ubiquitin antibody only in the presence of the overexpressed EGFP-tagged WT Nedd4-1 (Figure 5E). These ubiquitin-reactive bands were preserved when Myc-Rap2A was extracted under denaturing conditions (100°C, 1% SDS), indicating that Rap2A itself, and not associated proteins, is ubiquitinated by Nedd4-1 (Figure S5F). The ubiquitination of Rap2A was abolished when catalytically inactive instead of WT Nedd4-1 was used (Figure S5G). Unexpectedly, we did not detect any ubiquitination of TNIK (data not shown). Recently, diubiquitination of HRas and polyubiquitination of Rap1B were reported (Jura et al., 2006Jura N. Scotto-Lavino E. Sobczyk A. Bar-Sagi D.

Although a few neuroimaging studies suggest that neural activation of a large fronto-parieto-temporal network may underpin a variety of spiritual experiences, information on the causative link between such a network and spirituality is lacking. Combining pre- and post-neurosurgery personality assessment with advanced brain-lesion mapping techniques, we found that selective damage to left and right inferior posterior parietal regions induced a specific increase of self-transcendence. Therefore, modifications of neural activity in temporoparietal areas may induce unusually fast modulations of a stable personality trait related to transcendental self-referential awareness. These results hint at the active, crucial role of left and right parietal systems in determining self-transcendence and cast new light on the neurobiological bases of altered spiritual and religious attitudes and behaviors in neurological and mental disorders."

Functional epigenetic studies, in which gene expression is induced by treatment with demethylating agents, may identify novel genes with tumour-specific methylation. We used high-density gene expression microarrays in a functional epigenetic study of 11 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. Twenty-eight genes were then selected for analysis of promoter methylation status in cell lines and primary RCC. Eight genes (BNC1, PDLIM4, RPRM, CST6, SFRP1, GREM1, COL14A1 and COL15A1) showed frequent (>30% of RCC tested) tumour-specific promoter region methylation. Hypermethylation was associated with transcriptional silencing. Re-expression of BNC1, CST6, RPRM and SFRP1 suppressed the growth of RCC cell lines and RNA interference knock-down of BNC1, SFRP1 and COL14A1 increased the growth of RCC cell lines. Methylation of BNC1 or COL14A1 was associated with a poorer prognosis independent of tumour size, stage or grade. The identification of these epigenetically inactivated candidate RCC TSGs can provide insights into renal tumourigenesis and a basis for developing novel therapies and biomarkers for prognosis and detection."
https://openalex.org/W2167542517,"Hypoxic microenvironment supports cancer stem cell survival, causes poor response to anticancer therapy and tumor recurrence. Inhibition of Notch-1 signaling in adenocarcinoma of the lung (ACL) cells causes apoptosis specifically under hypoxia. Here, we found that Akt-1 activation is a key mediator of Notch-1 pro-survival effects under hypoxia. Notch-1 activates Akt-1 through repression of phosphatase and tensin (PTEN) homolog expression and induction of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). The latter seems to be the major determinant of Akt-1 stimulation, as Notch-1 signaling affects Akt-1 activation in PTEN−/− ACL cells. Both downregulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and dominant-negative IGF-1R sensitized ACL cells to γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI)-induced apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of IGF-1R protected ACL cells from GSI toxicity. Inhibition of Notch-1 caused reduced IGF-1R expression, whereas forced Notch-1 expression yielded opposite effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggested Notch-1 direct regulation of the IGF-1R promoter. Experiments in which human ACL cells were injected in mice confirmed elevated and specific co-expression of Notch-1IC, IGF-1R and pAkt-1 in hypoxic tumor areas. Our data provide a mechanistic explanation for Notch-1-mediated pro-survival function in hypoxic ACL tumor microenvironment. The results identify additional targets that may synergize with Notch-1 inhibition for ACL treatment."

The neural correlate of this percept is likely to be the robust responses evoked by stimulus offset in many visual, somatosensory, and auditory cortical neurons. In the visual cortex, these off responses are thought to arise from push-pull synaptic interactions between opponent bright- and dark-sensitive (ON and OFF) pathways that originate in retinal bipolar cells and remain anatomically segregated until they converge onto visual cortical neurons (Ferster, 1988Ferster D.

In somatosensory and auditory cortex, which do not show opponent processing, the mechanisms underlying off responses are unknown. Until recently, it has been controversial whether off responses can even be observed in primary auditory cortex (A1). Early studies reported the absence of off responses in A1, leading to the argument that sound offsets are perceptually less important than sound onsets (Phillips et al., 2002Phillips D.P. Hall S.E. Boehnke S.E. Central auditory onset responses, and temporal asymmetries in auditory perception.Hear. Res. 2002; 167: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Moreover, the failure to observe off responses in A1 was likely due to the use of barbiturate anesthesia, because more recent reports of prominent off responses in A1 have been from animals that were either awake (Fishman and Steinschneider, 2009Fishman Y.I.

Formation of spike response to sound tones in cat auditory cortex neurons: interaction of excitatory and inhibitory effects.Neuroscience. 1991; 43: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). What are the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying these off responses in auditory cortex? At least three types of mechanisms have been proposed to underlie off responses in auditory cortex (Figure 1). One proposal is that off responses are generated by the same neural mechanisms that generate on responses or responses to other rapid changes of sound intensity (Qin et al., 2007Qin L. Chimoto S. Sakai M. Wang J. Sato Y. Comparison between offset and onset responses of primary auditory cortex ON OFF neurons in awake cats.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For example, on and off responses could both be driven by presynaptic neurons that respond both to sound onset and offset (Figure 1A). A second proposal is that off responses are generated at the cellular level, by a rebound from sustained hyperpolarization—usually assumed to arise from long-lasting synaptic inhibition (Figure 1B) (Calford and Webster, 1981Calford M.B.

Formation of spike response to sound tones in cat auditory cortex neurons: interaction of excitatory and inhibitory effects.Neuroscience. 1991; 43: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This implies that information about sound offset is conveyed by a separate (inhibitory) channel from sound onset; thus, neurons could exhibit on responses, off responses, or both, depending on which channels they receive. A third proposal is that on and off responses in cortical neurons are driven by two separate, excitatory channels (Figure 1C). This is consistent with reports of off responses at multiple subcortical levels of the auditory system, including the auditory brainstem response (Henry, 1985aHenry K.R. ON and OFF components of the auditory brainstem response have different frequency- and intensity-specific properties.Hear. Res. 1985; 18: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), dorsal cochlear nucleus (Young and Brownell, 1976Young E.D. Brownell W.E.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8672-8679PubMed Google Scholar). In this view, off responses could either originate at the cochlea (e.g., from a mechanical transient in the basilar membrane caused by sound offset [Suga et al., 1975Suga N. Simmons J.A. Jen P.H. Peripheral specialization for fine analysis of doppler-shifted echoes in the auditory system of the “CF-FM” bat Pteronotus parnellii.J. Exp. Biol. 1975; 63: 161-192PubMed Google Scholar]) or could be generated by postinhibitory rebound at some point along the auditory hierarchy (Kuwada and Batra, 1999Kuwada S. Batra R. Coding of sound envelopes by inhibitory rebound in neurons of the superior olivary complex in the unanesthetized rabbit.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2273-2287PubMed Google Scholar), but in either case would be conveyed to the auditory cortex by a set of synapses distinct from those activated by sound onset. Here we demonstrate that on and off responses have distinct frequency tuning, at both the spiking and subthreshold level. Moreover, the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition is typically different for on and off responses. We show that this different excitatory-inhibitory balance is a consequence of the different frequency tuning of on and off responses, because responses can be purely excitatory at receptive field edges, which differ for on and off responses. Taken together, these results suggest that on and off responses in A1 are driven by two distinct sets of synaptic inputs. To further test this idea, we used forward suppression, which likely acts via synaptic depression (Chung et al., 2002Chung S. Li X. Nelson S.B. Short-term depression at thalamocortical synapses contributes to rapid adaptation of cortical sensory responses in vivo.Neuron. 2002; 34: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, Wehr and Zador, 2005Wehr M. Zador A.M. Synaptic mechanisms of forward suppression in rat auditory cortex.Neuron. 2005; 47: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that an on-on sequence causes complete forward suppression but that an off-on sequence causes no suppression at all, consistent with largely nonoverlapping sets of synaptic inputs that drive on and off responses. We first set out to characterize off responses in A1 using single-unit extracellular recordings (using the cell-attached patch technique). An example of a neuron with robust off responses is shown in Figure 2A . To verify that off responses were locked to stimulus offset, we varied stimulus duration for this and all extracellular and intracellular recordings included in this report. Off responses (blue regions in Figure 2A) were time-locked to stimulus offset and became stronger with increasing tone duration (Figure 2A, inset). To compare the frequency tuning of on and off responses, we presented an array of tones (1–40 kHz, 0–80 dB). Responses of a different neuron to this array (Figure 2B) showed the characteristic V-shaped receptive field for the on responses (orange). The region of off responses (blue) was shifted to higher frequencies compared to the on responses. A few weak off responses can also be seen along the low-frequency flank of the on receptive field (e.g., 1.0 kHz, 80 dB). This difference in frequency tuning was typical of our sample of neurons that exhibited off responses. The on response receptive fields for 18 neurons in primary auditory cortex (Figure 2C) show the characteristic V-shape, centered at the characteristic frequency (CF). These neurons were distributed throughout A1 (CFs ranged from 2.9–28.2 kHz; mean, 7.6 kHz; SD, 5.7 kHz). The off responses of these neurons were tuned 1–2 octaves above the on response CF (Figures 2D–2F). A much less robust region of off responses can also be seen 1–2 octaves below CF (Figure 2D). A direct comparison of the receptive fields (Figure 2E) for on responses (orange) and off responses (blue) reveals that they are largely nonoverlapping. Thus, on and off responses show distinct frequency tuning, consistent with the possibility that they are driven by distinct sets of synaptic inputs. To test the hypothesis that off responses are produced by rebound from synaptic inhibition that is sustained throughout the duration of a tone, we used in vivo whole-cell methods to record tone-evoked synaptic currents. We selected neurons that showed clear off responses to at least one tone frequency. By voltage clamping neurons to three different holding potentials, we could disentangle the excitatory and inhibitory contributions to each response. We blocked intrinsic voltage-dependent conductances by including QX-314, Cs+, and TEA in the patch pipettes. At hyperpolarized holding potentials (−88 mV in Figure 3A , dark blue trace), transient inward synaptic currents were evoked at tone onset. Because this holding potential is near the inhibitory reversal potential, these currents were predominantly excitatory. At depolarized potentials (+12 mV in Figure 3A, magenta trace), transient outward synaptic currents were evoked at tone onset; because this holding potential is near the excitatory reversal potential, these currents were predominantly inhibitory. Both the excitatory and inhibitory currents evoked by tone onset were transient, lasting only about 100 ms, despite the 400 ms tone duration. This indicates that inhibitory synaptic currents are not sustained throughout the duration of the tone. We used these synaptic currents to estimate the underlying excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (Figure 3B). In agreement with inspection of the synaptic currents, tone onset evoked transient excitatory (green) and inhibitory (red) synaptic conductances. Across a wide range of tone durations (100–1600 ms), inhibition lasted only about 100 ms after tone onset (Figure 3C). In many cells, off responses could occur without any onset-evoked inhibition (Figures 3D and 3E). For 27% of the tones that evoked off responses (total offset-evoked synaptic conductance >1 nS), there was no onset-evoked inhibition (inhibitory synaptic conductance was <1 nS; n = 75/278 off responses in 16/25 cells). For tones that did evoke inhibition at onset, it was transient, with a duration of 85 ± 64 ms (mean ± SD, n = 203 on responses in 25 neurons, tone durations 400–1600 ms). The duration of inhibition was uncorrelated with tone duration (r = 0.08, n.s.), further demonstrating that inhibition was not sustained throughout tone duration. Nevertheless, each of these tones produced off responses, indicating that off responses were not produced by rebound from sustained synaptic inhibition. Likewise, off responses were not produced by rebound from hyperpolarization due to intrinsic membrane properties, which were blocked in these neurons. We cannot rule out the possibility that in intact neurons (for which we haven't blocked voltage-gated channels), an intrinsic rebound mechanism could partially contribute to off responses to the subset of short (∼100 ms) tones that evoke onset inhibition. However, the fact that we observed off responses across a wide range of tone durations, with voltage-gated channels blocked, indicates that off responses do not critically depend on rebound from inhibition, suggesting the operation of a more general—i.e., synaptic—mechanism. If on and off responses are driven by the same sets of synapses, they should exhibit an identical balance of excitation to inhibition. In contrast, if on and off responses are driven by distinct sets of synapses, they could in principle exhibit a different balance of excitation and inhibition. The on responses in Figures 3A–3C consist of a roughly balanced mixture of excitation and inhibition, whereas the off responses are purely excitatory. This can even be seen directly from the synaptic currents at +12 mV (Figure 3A, magenta line), which show outward currents for the on responses but not for the off responses. This off response was purely excitatory across a wide range of tone durations (Figure 3C); although the off response increased in amplitude with longer tones, it remained purely excitatory. This indicates that the sets of synapses underlying the on and off responses cannot be identical, since one set includes inhibition whereas the other does not. This different excitatory-inhibitory balance for on and off responses was typical of all of our recorded neurons. Many neurons (for some tone frequencies) showed off responses that were roughly balanced in amplitude, but showed on responses consisting of nearly pure excitation (an example is shown in Figure 3D). Approximately balanced off responses could also occur in the absence of an on response (an example is shown in Figure 3E) or together with a balanced on response (Figure 3F). In general, the ratio of excitation to inhibition for the on response showed no correlation with the ratio for the off response to the same tone, across our sample of 25 off-responsive neurons (Figure 3G, r = 0.04, n.s.; this correlation was also n.s. for each duration analyzed separately). The fact that the synaptic balance of on responses was independent from that of off responses provides further evidence that distinct sets of synapses underlie on and off responses. What accounts for this different balance of excitation to inhibition? The simplest interpretation is that the sets of synapses underlying on and off responses are largely nonoverlapping and therefore can have independent excitatory-inhibitory composition. An alternative possibility is that the sets of synapses underlying on and off responses are largely overlapping anatomically but can show functionally different excitatory-inhibitory composition because excitatory and inhibitory synapses are subject to differential synaptic depression. Inhibitory inputs depress more strongly in auditory cortex in vitro (Metherate and Ashe, 1994Metherate R. Ashe J.H. Facilitation of an NMDA receptor-mediated EPSP by paired-pulse stimulation in rat neocortex via depression of GABAergic IPSPs.J. Physiol. 1994; 481: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and can be more strongly affected by forward suppression in vivo (Wehr and Zador, 2005Wehr M. Zador A.M. Synaptic mechanisms of forward suppression in rat auditory cortex.Neuron. 2005; 47: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In vivo, when two sounds are presented in rapid succession, most cells (∼80%) show identical excitatory-inhibitory balance for both responses. In a subset of cells (∼20%), inhibition recovers more slowly from forward suppression, so that the second sound evokes purely excitatory responses when delivered within about 100 ms. An example of such a purely excitatory response to the second in a pair of clicks is shown in Figures 4A and 4B . If an on response causes forward suppression of the inhibitory component of the subsequent off response, this mechanism could account for a purely excitatory off response, even if both responses were produced by the anatomically identical set of synapses. To test whether this mechanism might account for the different excitatory-inhibitory balance we observed in on and off responses, we presented click pairs to a subset of cells. In 2/5 (40%) of these cells, we observed a purely excitatory response to the second in a pair of clicks (P2), for click separations of 100 ms (the shortest interval tested). Assuming that clicks and tones produce similar synaptic depression, this suggests that differential depression of inhibition could in some cases account for purely excitatory off responses. However, the relatively short time course of this effect (<200 ms, Figure 4B) suggests that it cannot explain purely excitatory off responses for tones longer than 200 ms. Moreover, the occurrence of a purely excitatory P2 was independent of the occurrence of purely excitatory off responses. For example, the cell in Figures 4C and 4D showed balanced excitatory-inhibitory responses to both clicks in a pair, but purely excitatory off responses to tones with the same durations as the click separations (Figure 4D, arrow). Interestingly, the cell in Figures 4E and 4F showed a purely excitatory P2 response for only a 100 ms click separation (Figure 4E) and a purely excitatory off response for only a 100 ms tone (Figure 4F), suggesting that these purely excitatory responses may share an underlying mechanism. However, the on responses to these tones were purely excitatory even when the off responses consisted of balanced excitation and inhibition, which strongly suggests that the on and off responses are driven by distinct sets of synaptic inputs. We conclude that differential forward suppression of inhibitory inputs can occur, but in most cases cannot account for the differing excitatory-inhibitory composition of on and off responses. This further supports the conclusion that on and off responses are likely driven by distinct sets of synaptic inputs. Although excitation and inhibition are typically balanced throughout the receptive field, pure excitation can often be observed at the edges of the receptive field (Wehr and Zador, 2003Wehr M. Zador A.M. Balanced inhibition underlies tuning and sharpens spike timing in auditory cortex.Nature. 2003; 426: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). This observation, combined with our finding that off responses are tuned 1–2 octaves higher than on responses, led us to the following hypothesis: purely excitatory on and off responses are both evoked by tones at the edges of their respective receptive fields. Thus, a tone within the core of the on receptive field might lie at the edge of the off receptive field and thereby evoke a balanced on response and a purely excitatory off response. Conversely, a tone at the edge of the on receptive field might lie within the core of the off receptive field, and thereby evoke a purely excitatory on response and a balanced off response. In this view, the excitatory-inhibitory balance of both on and off responses is governed by a common principle—that tones at receptive field edges can evoke pure excitation—and the different excitatory-inhibitory balance of on and off responses evoked by individual tones is a consequence of the fact that on and off responses are driven by distinct sets of synaptic inputs with largely nonoverlapping frequency tuning. To test this hypothesis, we examined the excitatory-inhibitory composition of on and off responses throughout the tonal receptive field. Figure 5 shows the excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields for both on responses (solid lines) and off responses (dashed lines) of an example neuron. Within the core of the on receptive field (e.g., at 4.1 kHz, see inset), excitation and inhibition were approximately balanced in amplitude. At the edges of the on receptive field (e.g., at 1.7 kHz, or at 13.9 kHz), on responses consisted of nearly pure excitation. At 33.6 kHz, within the core of the off receptive field, the off response was approximately balanced, but because this frequency is at the far edge of the on receptive field, the on response was purely excitatory. At the edge of the off receptive field (13.9 kHz and 28.2 kHz), off responses consisted of nearly pure excitation. Because 13.9 kHz lies at the edges of both receptive fields, both on and off responses were purely excitatory. Most of the off receptive field probably exceeded 33.6 kHz, the highest frequency tested for this cell. This pattern can also be seen at the population level, in the sample of 13 cells for which we measured the complete frequency tuning of synaptic inputs. Figure 6A shows the excitatory and inhibitory tuning curves for on responses averaged across the population. Excitation and inhibition were approximately balanced within the receptive field core (<1 octave from CF), but were predominantly excitatory at the edges (e.g., at −2 or +2 octaves from CF). Because not all neurons show pure excitation at the edges of their receptive fields, this effect is less prominent in the population average than in some individual neurons (such as the one in Figure 5). For off responses (Figure 6B), similarly, excitation dominated at the receptive field edges (across a wide range, from −2 to 2 octaves from CF) but was more balanced with inhibition closer to the core (i.e., ≥2 octaves above CF). Consistent with this, the ratios of excitation to inhibition for individual on responses were clustered around 1 within an octave of CF (Figure 6C), but could range much higher at the receptive field edges (1–2 octaves from CF) for a subset of cells. Likewise for off responses, the ratios of excitation to inhibition in the core of the off receptive field (≥2 octaves above CF) were clustered around 1 (Figure 6D) but could range much higher at the edge of the off receptive field (<1 octave from CF). It is likely that we undersampled the core of the off receptive fields in Figure 6B. Because off responses were typically tuned 1–2 octaves above on responses, the core of the off receptive field was likely to be higher than 40 kHz (the highest frequency we could deliver with our system) for the two high-CF (>10 kHz) neurons in our sample.Figure 6Both Unbalanced On and Off Responses Can Be Explained by Pure Excitation at the Edges of the Receptive Field (Group Data)Show full caption(A and B) Synaptic tuning curves for on responses (A) and off responses (B) averaged across 13 neurons, with normalized peak excitatory (green) and inhibitory (red) conductances plotted as a function of tone frequency (aligned to CF for each neuron, where CF is defined by on responses).

The ratio of peak excitatory conductance to peak inhibitory conductance is plotted against frequency (the absolute value of the distance from CF). Tones were 80 dB SPL for (A)–(D). These results suggest that on and off responses are driven by largely nonoverlapping sets of synaptic inputs. This predicts that forward suppression, which is thought to be mediated by synaptic depression, should act between on responses but not between on and off responses. In other words, an on response should cause forward suppression of a subsequent on response, because they are mediated by the same set of synapses. In contrast, an off response should not cause forward suppression of a subsequent on response, because they are mediated by different sets of synapses. To test this prediction, we recorded extracellularly from single neurons using the cell-attached patch technique and identified 52 neurons that exhibited both o"

The function of IGF1R in cancer has been well documented and anti-IGF1R strategies to treat cancer have shown initial positive results. However, the role of IR in tumor biology, independent of IGF1R, is less clear. To address this issue, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to specifically downregulate IR in two cancer cell lines, LCC6 and T47D. Cells with reduced IR showed reduced insulin-stimulated Akt activation, without affecting IGF1R activation. Cells with reduced IR formed fewer colonies in anchorage-independent conditions. LCC6 IR shRNA xenograft tumors in mice had reduced growth, angiogenesis and lymphangiogensis when compared with LCC6 wild-type cells. Accordingly, LCC6 IR shRNA clones produced less hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and VEGF-D. Furthermore, LCC6 IR shRNA cells formed fewer pulmonary metastases when compared with LCC6 wild-type cells. Using in vivo luciferase imaging, we have shown that LCC6 IR shRNA cells have less seeding and colonization potential in the lung and liver of mice than LCC6 cells. In conclusion, downregulation of IR inhibited cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Our data argue that IR should also be targeted in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2110891146,"Cancer cells show characteristic gene expression profiles. Recent studies support the potential importance of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The membrane-anchored protease regulator RECK is downregulated in many cancers, and forced expression of RECK in tumor cells results in decreased malignancy in animal models. RECK is also essential for mammalian development. In this study, we found that RECK is a target of at least three groups of miRNAs (miR-15b/16, miR-21 and miR-372/373); that RECK mutants lacking the target sites for these miRNA show augmented tumor/metastasis-suppressor activities; and that miR-372/373 are upregulated in response to hypoxia through HIF1alpha and TWIST1, whereas miR-21 is upregulated by RAS/ERK signaling. These data indicate that the hypoxia- and RAS-signaling pathways converge on RECK through miRNAs, cooperatively downregulating this tumor suppressor and thereby promoting malignant cell behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1994595494,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (encoded by Cftr) that impair its role as an apical chloride channel that supports bicarbonate transport1. Individuals with cystic fibrosis show retained, thickened mucus that plugs airways and obstructs luminal organs2 as well as numerous other abnormalities that include inflammation of affected organs1, alterations in lipid metabolism3 and insulin resistance4. Here we show that colonic epithelial cells and whole lung tissue from Cftr-deficient mice show a defect in peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ, encoded by Pparg) function that contributes to a pathological program of gene expression. Lipidomic analysis of colonic epithelial cells suggests that this defect results in part from reduced amounts of the endogenous PPAR-γ ligand 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 (15-keto-PGE2). Treatment of Cftr-deficient mice with the synthetic PPAR-γ ligand rosiglitazone partially normalizes the altered gene expression pattern associated with Cftr deficiency and reduces disease severity. Rosiglitazone has no effect on chloride secretion in the colon, but it increases expression of the genes encoding carbonic anhydrases 4 and 2 (Car4 and Car2), increases bicarbonate secretion and reduces mucus retention. These studies reveal a reversible defect in PPAR-γ signaling in Cftr-deficient cells that can be pharmacologically corrected to ameliorate the severity of the cystic fibrosis phenotype in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1979072037,"Members of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family are involved in various pharmacological, pathophysiological, and physiological processes, such as hepatic drug uptake, progress of cancer, or transport of hormones. Although variability in expression and function of OATPs has been investigated in detail, data concerning regulation are rather limited. Here, we report a novel mechanism for rapid regulation of OATP2B1 mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) resulting in significant changes of transport activity. PKC activation by the phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, PMA) resulted in increased phosphorylation of OATP2B1 as well as reduced OATP2B1 transport activity with a decrease in Vmax of E1S uptake (288 ± 21 (control) versus 165 ± 16 pmol/min/mg of protein (PMA)). This effect was sensitive to the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM-I). Confocal microscopy, fluorescence-based internalization assay, and live-cell imaging using green fluorescent protein-tagged OATP2B1 revealed that transport inhibition was due to internalization of the transporter. Furthermore, colocalization with LAMP-2 and chloroquine-sensitive degradation of OATP2B1 suggest that the internalized protein is targeted to a lysosomal degradation pathway. With regard to the underlying mechanism inhibition of caveolin/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis failed to prevent OATP2B1 internalization, whereas inhibition of clathrin-mediated processes blocked OATP2B1 sequestration. However, small interfering RNA-mediated clathrin knock-down affected general trafficking of OATP2B1 and resulted in intracellular accumulation in the absence of PMA. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that OATP2B1 function is regulated by PKC-mediated, clathrin-dependent internalization and followed by lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, internalization could be shown in an ex vivo placenta perfusion. Our findings represent a new, rapid mechanism in regulation of human OATPs.

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified within the liver-enriched OATP1B1 transporter with impact on transport function (1Iwai M. Suzuki H. Ieiri I. Otsubo K. Sugiyama Y. Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 14: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Tirona R.G. Leake B.F. Merino G. Kim R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35669-35675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Some of those single nucleotide polymorphisms are commonly occurring and translate into alterations of drug disposition in humans. Due to reduced hepatic accumulation of OATP1B1 substrates such as statins, which exert their pharmacological function on the 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in hepatocytes, carriers of certain variants appear to exhibit decreased cholesterol-lowering efficacy (3Tachibana-Iimori R.

Accordingly, subjects carrying these OATP1B1 variants have an enhanced risk of myotoxic side effects (4Deng J.W. Song I.S. Shin H.J. Yeo C.W. Cho D.Y. Shon J.H. Shin J.G. Pharmacogenet.

In addition to these pharmacokinetic effects, increasing evidence suggests that members of the OATP family are associated with cancer development and progression. OATP1B3, which is mainly expressed in hepatocytes under normal conditions, was recently reported to be overexpressed in prostatic cancer as well as colorectal adenocarcinomas. In prostatic cancer, the OATP1B3 334GG/699AA haplotype was associated with a prolonged median survival, which was suggested to be due to the impaired testosterone transport of this variant (7Hamada A. Sissung T. Price D.K. Danesi R. Chau C.H. Sharifi N. Venzon D. Maeda K. Nagao K. Sparreboom A. Mitsuya H. Dahut W.L. Figg W.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In colorectal cancer cell lines, OATP1B3 expression diminished drug-induced apoptosis by reducing the transcriptional activity of p53. Overexpression of a non-functional OATP1B3 variant neither resulted in anti-apoptosis nor affected p53 transcriptional activity suggesting that this effect is associated with transport activity (8Lee W. Belkhiri A. Lockhart A.C. Merchant N. Glaeser H. Harris E.I. Washington M.K. Brunt E.M. Zaika A. Kim R.B. El-Rifai W. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 10315-10323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast to the predominant liver-enriched expression of OATP1B1 and -1B3, other members of the OATP family demonstrate a wide tissue expression (for review, see Ref. 9Hagenbuch B. Gui C. Xenobiotica. 2008; 38: 778-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For example, OATP2B1 is highly expressed in liver, intestine, heart, placenta, and platelets (10Al Sarakbi W. Mokbel R.

Although clinical studies providing evidence of a pharmacokinetic impact of OATP2B1 are still limited, its expression in organs like placenta or mammary gland suggests an important role in uptake of precursor molecules for steroid hormone synthesis. Although the impact of inherited modifications of OATPs has been studied in detail, functional modulation by altered expression or other modifications have been addressed only in few studies. Recently, gender-dependent differences and regulation of OATP expression by nuclear receptors (e.g. farnesoid X, liver X, and pregnane X receptor) have been described for human as well as rodent OATPs (21Cheng X.

These effects are tightly controlled on a transcriptional level, dependent on mRNA as well as protein turnover and hence represent a slow mode of response. We hypothesize that physiological mechanisms exist that enable a fast, local and transient adaptation of OATP expression to altered external conditions to guarantee cellular homoeostasis. Several signaling pathways comprising different second messenger and protein kinase/phosphatase systems have been identified to affect protein modification. So far, activation of protein kinase A or C (PKA and PKC, respectively) has been associated with alterations of transporter function and/or their presence in the plasma membrane as their primary site of action. For example, such short-term regulation has been reported for the human organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1); here, PKC-induced down-regulation of transport activity was achieved through carrier retrieval (25Wolff N.A.

Klaassen C.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PKA activation has been shown to stimulate membrane localization of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged OATP1B1 and to enhance E1S uptake by ∼20% (28Sun A.Q. Ponamgi V.M. Boyer J.L. Suchy F.J. Pharm. Res. 2008; 25: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study we describe a rapid regulation of OATP2B1 function and localization by PKC activation in MDCKII-OATP2B1 and Caco-2 cells as well as human placenta. Fast intracellular accumulation of the transporter resulting in altered substrate kinetics was confirmed by immunofluorescence and live-cell imaging of GFP-tagged OATP2B1. This process was mediated by clathrin-dependent retrieval into intracellular vesicles, and subsequent lysosomal degradation of OATP2B1. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells were stably transfected with human OATP2B1 and characterized as described previously (17Grube M. Köck K. Karner S. Reuther S. Ritter C.A. Jedlitschky G. Kroemer H.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MDCKII-OATP2B1, the parental cell line as well as Caco-2 cells were grown in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Except for the experiments, the transfected cell line was maintained in medium containing 350 μg/ml of hygromycin B. Caco-2 cells were seeded at an initial density of 6 × 104 cells/cm2 and medium was changed every other day. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. [3H]E1S (specific activity, 50 Ci/mmol) and [3H]DHEAS (specific activity, 63 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany) and Biotrend (Cologne, Germany), respectively. Bisindolylmaleimide-I (BIM-I) was from Tocris (Bristol, United Kingdom), PMA was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Rockford, IL). All other chemicals were purchased from standard suppliers. Mouse monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 and anti-E-cadherin antibodies were from BD Bioscience, anti-phospho-Ser/Thr/Tyr from Anaspec (San Jose, CA), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from Biodesign (Saco, MA), anti-clathrin heavy chain (CHC) monoclonal antibody TD.1 and anti-LAMP-2 were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). For detection of OATP2B1 a guinea pig polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 25–41 of OATP2B1 (OATP2B1/gp) as well as a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the 15 C-terminal amino acids of OATP2B1 (OATP2B1/r) were used. The transporter cDNA fragment from the pcDNA3.1/Hygro-OATP2B1-construct, which has previously been described (29Grube M. Reuther S. Meyer zu Schwabedissen H. Köck K. Draber K. Ritter C.A. Fusch C.

The sequence was verified against the reference sequence (accession number AB026256) and MDCKII cells were transfected with the OATP2B1/vector-construct using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were selected for antibiotic resistance using 0.6 mg/ml of neomycin (Invitrogen) and resistant cell clones were characterized for OATP2B1-GFP expression using immunofluorescence microscopy. To generate a phosphorylation site defective pcDNA3.1/Hygro-OATP2B1 construct, amino acids Thr22, Thr28, Ser34, Ser43, Thr318, Ser320, Ser328, Ser330, Ser333, Ser337, Thr338, Thr367, Ser685, Ser687, Ser688, Ser698, and Ser707 were simultaneously substituted by alanine using a multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The human transferrin receptor (hTfR) was amplified from human placenta-derived cDNA using primers 5′-atgatggatcaagctagatca (forward primer) and 5′-ttaaaactcattgtcaatgtcc (reverse primer) and cloned to the N terminus of yellow fluorescent protein into the pcDNA6.2-YFP vector (Invitrogen). The sequence was verified against the reference sequence (accession number NM_003234.2). This vector construct was transiently transfected into MDCKII-OATP2B1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For transport studies cells were seeded in 24-well dishes and cultured to confluence. Cells were preincubated for the times indicated in the respective sections or figure legends at 37 °C with 500 μl of medium/well containing protein kinase activators, inhibitors, or internalization inhibitors. Afterward the medium was removed, cells were washed twice with prewarmed PBS, and incubated at 37 °C with a transport buffer containing 140 mm NaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and the respective substances. At specified time points the transport buffer was rapidly aspirated and cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were solubilized in 0.2% SDS containing 0.5 mm EDTA, an aliquot was dissolved in 2 ml of scintillation mixture (Rotiszint, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and measured in a scintillation β-counter (type 1409, LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland). Determination of kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of E1S uptake in the presence or absence of PMA was obtained by incubating the cells with increasing concentrations of E1S. For immunohistological analyses cells were grown to confluence on coverslips in 12-well plates. Cells were fixed for 10 min with ethanol (99.9%), permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%) for 5 min at room temperature, and blocked with 5% fetal calf serum in PBS. Staining was carried out using the OATP2B1/r antibody for 2 h at room temperature as described previously (17Grube M. Köck K. Karner S. Reuther S. Ritter C.A. Jedlitschky G. Kroemer H.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1735-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The secondary AlexaFluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen) was used for fluorescence detection. For LAMP-2-costaining, cells were incubated with the OATP2B1/r (1:200) and LAMP-2 (1:50) antibodies. The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor® 568 and chicken anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 (1:200 each). The cells were washed as mentioned before and mounted on glass slides with Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Following treatment, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1% (w/w) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 0.1 μm pepstatin and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (Sigma)) for 1 h on ice. Lysates were precleared with Fast-Flow protein G-Sepharose (100 μl/ml of cell lysate) for 10 min, followed by immunoprecipitation of 100 μg of protein using the OATP2B1/gp antibody and Fast-Flow protein G-Sepharose. The complexes were washed with RIPA buffer and proteins were eluted with 4× Laemmli before subjecting the samples to a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was performed using an anti-phospho-Ser/Thr/Tyr antibody as well as the OATP2B1/r antibody. For quantitation, densitometric values of the phosphorylated protein were normalized to the amount of immunoblotted OATP2B1. OATP2B1-GFP-expressing cells were seeded into LabTekIITM chambered coverglass (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) and incubated in normal tissue culture medium in a Pekon incubator (Pekon, Germany) at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Imaging was performed with the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) equipped with an argon-ion laser. Cells were examined with a 63 × 1.2 NA Zeiss water immersion c-apochromate objective in phenol red-free medium. GFP fluorescence was detected using the 488 nm emission line of the argon laser. The beampath contained a 488-nm main dichroic mirror and a 505-nm longpass filter. The images represent 0.8-μm thick confocal slices. For time-lapse experiments sequential images were acquired every minute. Immediately after delivery, the fetal and maternal sides of three placentas were perfused as described recently (30May K. Minarikova V. Linnemann K. Zygmunt M. Kroemer H.K. Fusch C. Siegmund W. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 12 ml/min in the maternal circuit and 4 ml/min in the fetal circuit with an arterial pressure between 25 and 40 mm Hg. The total perfusion volume in each circuit was 140 ml. Following an open loop perfusion for 30 min to remove blood, a close-loop perfusion for 1 h was performed for stabilization and detection of leakage or noncongruent maternal and fetal perfusion. Afterward, 100 nm PMA dissolved in circulation medium was given to the maternal and fetal circulation and perfused for 1 h. Tissue samples were dissected from an unperfused cotyledon before and from the perfused cotyledon after perfusion with PMA. After staining with the OATP2B1/r and E-cadherin antibody the colocalization coefficient of OATP2B1 with E-cadherin in confocal images was calculated by dividing the number of pixels of the OATP2B1 channel that colocalized with signals of the E-cadherin channel by the total number of OATP2B1 pixels. For qualitative analysis colocalizing pixels of both channels were subtracted from the original OATP2B1 signal using the LSM Image Browser (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) and the resulting images were presented in false color. The origin of the internalized OATP2B1 was investigated using the membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. For cell surface biotinylation, cells were seeded in 12-well dishes, treated with PMA or DMSO, washed three times with ice-cold PBS/CM (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2), and incubated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg/ml in PBS/CM) at 4 °C. After 1 h, each well was rinsed three times with PBS/CM containing 100 mm glycine and then incubated for 20 min in the same solution at 4 °C to ensure complete quenching of unreacted biotin. Afterward, cells were lysed for 1 h with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4). Following centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 × g, 100 μg of the supernatant protein was incubated with 33 μl of Neutravidin beads (ThermoScientific) overnight in a total volume of 133 μl. After three washings with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted by incubation with 4× Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 95 °C and subjected to Western blot analysis. For the fluorescence-based internalization assay, biotinylated cells were incubated in prewarmed medium containing either DMSO or PMA for 1 h at 37 °C to initiate internalization. Residual cell surface biotin was cleaved off by incubating the cells three times for 20 min at 4 °C with glutathione stripping solution (50 mm glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.75% (v/v) 10 n NaOH). Bovine serum albumin and NaOH were added just before use. Afterward, cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS. Efficiency of stripping was determined on biotinylated cells incubated in parallel on ice. Following fixation with ethanol (99.9%) and permeabilization with Triton X-100 (0.1%) cells were probed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin at a concentration of 40 μg/ml (30 min at 37 °C) and the OATP2B1/r antibody. Samples were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 μm aprotinin, and 0.1 μm pepstatin). After 1 h on ice and occasional vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris. After determination of the protein content using the BCA method equal amounts of protein were loaded on 7.5 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After separation and transfer to polyvinylidene membranes, blots were probed with OATP2B1/r (31Grube M. Meyer zu Schwabedissen H.E. Präger D. Haney J. Möritz K.U. Meissner K. Rosskopf D. Eckel L.

Immunoreactivity was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare). To block lysosomal acidification and lysosomal protease activity the cells were cultured in the presence of 100 μm chloroquine in regular medium. Cells were transfected using siRNA duplexes (Invitrogen) directed against canine caveolin-1 (Gi:50979109; Cav1_314, AUUGGGAUGCCAAAGAGGGTT; Cav1_385, GCAGUUGUGCCGUGCAUUATT; and Cav1_503, AUGUUGAUGCGGAUAUUGCTT) and canine clathrin heavy chain (Gi:73966640; CHC_2077, GCAGUUUGCCCAAAUGUUATT). siRNA (20 nm each for caveolin-1 and 45 nm for CHC) was transfected with LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX applying the reverse transfection protocol. MDCKII-OATP2B1 as well as hTfR-transfected MDCKII-OATP2B1 cells were subjected to various conditions inhibiting clathrin- or caveolae/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. To block internalization mediated via clathrin-dependent mechanisms cells were preincubated with either hypertonic medium (0.45 m sucrose in culture medium) for 30 min or with 10 mm acetic acid in culture medium (pH 5.0) for 10 min as described previously (32Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To disrupt caveolin-mediated endocytosis, preincubation with either filipin (5 μg/ml) or nystatin (25 μm) for 30 min was performed (33Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar). Following these treatments, cells were either incubated with DMSO or PMA in medium for 1 h and immunostained as described above. Phosphorylation sites of the OATP2B1 were predicted using phosphorylation site prediction programs NetPhos 2.0 (34Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol.

Amino acids located intracellularly with a score higher than 0.5 (NetPhos 2.0, Disphos) as well as amino acids identified in GPS prediction using a high threshold were investigated further. Experimental data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.). Graphs and statistical analyses were performed with Excel or GraphPad Prism 5.01. To determine statistical significance Student's t test was used. For phosphorylation experiments the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed. When more than two groups were present, data were compared by one-way analysis of variance using Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined with GraphPad Prism 5.01 using nonlinear regression analysis employing the following equation: Y = (Vmax × X)/(Km + X), where Y is transport velocity per time and X is substrate concentration. For determination of internalization the ratio between intracellular and plasma membrane expression was calculated by definition of regions of interest in the LSM Image Browser and computing of the mean intensities.

https://openalex.org/W2008075361,"Recent studies have established that amplification of the MET proto-oncogene can cause resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with EGFR-activating mutations. The role of non-amplified MET in EGFR-dependent signaling before TKI resistance, however, is not well understood. Using NSCLC cell lines and transgenic models, we demonstrate here that EGFR activation by either mutation or ligand binding increases MET gene expression and protein levels. Our analysis of 202 NSCLC patient specimens was consistent with these observations: levels of MET were significantly higher in NSCLC with EGFR mutations than in NSCLC with wild-type EGFR. EGFR regulation of MET levels in cell lines occurred through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α pathway in a hypoxia-independent manner. This regulation was lost, however, after MET gene amplification or overexpression of a constitutively active form of HIF-1α. EGFR- and hypoxia-induced invasiveness of NSCLC cells, but not cell survival, were found to be MET dependent. These findings establish that, absent MET amplification, EGFR signaling can regulate MET levels through HIF-1α and that MET is a key downstream mediator of EGFR-induced invasiveness in EGFR-dependent NSCLC cells."

https://openalex.org/W2087650666,"Adhesion of eukaryotic cells is a complex process during which interactions between extracellular ligands and cellular receptors on the plasma membrane modulate the organization of the cytoskeleton. Pathogens particularly rely often on adhesion to tissues or host cells in order to establish an infection. Here, we examined the adhesion of Plasmodium sporozoites, the motile form of the malaria parasite transmitted by the mosquito, to flat surfaces. Experiments using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and analysis of sporozoites under flow revealed a stepwise and developmentally regulated adhesion process. The sporozoite-specific transmembrane proteins TRAP and S6 were found to be important for initial adhesion. The structurally related protein TLP appears to play a specific role in adhesion under static conditions, as tlp(-) sporozoites move 4 times less efficiently than wild-type sporozoites. This likely reflects the decreased intradermal sporozoite movement of sporozoites lacking TLP. Further, these three sporozoite surface proteins also act in concert with actin filaments to organize efficient adhesion of the sporozoite prior to initiating motility and host cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2089767259,"Although several non-receptor activators of heterotrimeric G proteins have been identified, the structural features of G proteins that determine their interaction with such activators and the subsequent biological effects are poorly understood. Here we investigated the structural determinants in Gαi3 necessary for its regulation by GIV/girdin, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Gαi subunits. Using G protein activity and in vitro pulldown assays we demonstrate that Gαi3 is a better substrate for GIV than the highly homologous Gαo. We identified Trp-258 in the Gαi subunit as a novel structural determinant for GIV binding by comparing GIV binding to Gαi3/Gαo chimeras. Mutation of Trp-258 to the corresponding Phe in Gαo decreased GIV binding in vitro and in cultured cells but did not perturb interaction with other Gα-binding partners, i.e. Gβγ, AGS3 (a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor), GAIP/RGS19 (a GTPase-activating protein), and LPAR1 (a G protein-coupled receptor). Activation of Gαi3 by GIV was also dramatically reduced when Trp-258 was replaced with Tyr, Leu, Ser, His, Asp, or Ala, highlighting that Trp is required for maximal activation. Moreover, when mutant Gαi3 W258F was expressed in HeLa cells they failed to undergo cell migration and to enhance Akt signaling after growth factor or G protein-coupled receptor stimulation. Thus activation of Gαi3 by GIV is essential for biological functions associated with Gαi3 activation. In conclusion, we have discovered a novel structural determinant on Gαi that plays a key role in defining the selectivity and efficiency of the GEF activity of GIV on Gαi and that represents an attractive target site for designing small molecules to disrupt the Gαi-GIV interface for therapeutic purposes.

Heterotrimeric G proteins are molecular switches that control signal transduction. G protein cycling between active and inactive states is controlled via interaction with regulatory proteins.

Because the duration and extent of G protein-mediated signaling is determined by the lifetime of Gα in the GTP-bound state, it is crucial to define the molecular machinery that triggers G protein activation to understand how this signal transduction pathway functions.

Because the GEF function of GIV appears critical for cancer metastasis, disruption of the interface formed between the GEF motif of GIV and Gαi is potentially of therapeutic significance, and defining the molecular basis and properties of this interface is crucial for the future development of pharmacological agents that target this interface. Here we investigated in depth the structural determinants in the Gαi3 subunit required for it to interact with GIV and be activated. Using the Gα selectivity of GIV to identify such determinants, we found that residues outside of the previously described Gαi-GIV interface (11Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl.

Cloning of rat Gαi3 into pGEX-4T-1 or pET28b and GIV-CT-(1623–1870) into pET28b were described previously (11Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Rat Gαo (isoform 1, Gαo1, hereafter referred to as Gαo) was cloned from pGBT9-Gαo (22De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and inserted between the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector to generate GST-Gαo or between the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pET28b vector to generate His-Gαo. GIV-CT-(1623–1870) was cloned from pcDNA 3.1-GIV (16Enomoto A. Murakami H. Asai N. Morone N. Watanabe T. Kawai K. Murakumo Y. Usukura J. Kaibuchi K. Takahashi M. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 389-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and inserted between the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector to generate GST-GIV-CT-(1623–1870). GIV-CTs-(1660–1870, “s” stands for “short”) was cloned from pcDNA 3.1-GIV and inserted between the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pET28b vector to generate His-GIV-CTs-(1660–1870) used in the GTPase and GTPγS binding assays. To generate Gαi3 with three FLAG sequences fused to the C terminus of the protein (Gαi3-FLAG), rat Gαi3 was amplified by PCR from pET28b-Gαi3 with primers designed to add HindIII and BamHI restrictions sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and to replace the stop codon of the original cDNA with a glycine codon. The PCR product was digested and inserted between the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of p3XFLAG-CMV-14. Untagged rat Gαi3 cloned into pcDNA3.1 was described previously (18Ghosh P. Garcia-Marcos M. Bornheimer S.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mouse LPA receptor 1 (LPAR1) cloned into pFLAG-CMV-1 was a gift from Dr. Jerold Chun (Scripps Research Institute) and was described previously (23Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Gαi3 and Gαo mutants were generated using specific primers (sequences available upon request) following the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange II, Stratagene). All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing (University of California at San Diego Moores Cancer Center Sequencing Facility). GST-Gαi3/o chimeras were generated by using an overlapping PCR strategy (24Vázquez-Prado J. Miyazaki H. Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54283-54290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pGEX-4T-1-Gαi3 and pGEX-4T-1-Gαo were used as templates to amplify the following sequences in the first PCR: Gαi3-(1–59), Gαi3-(1–177), Gαi3-(1–270), Gαi3-(178–354), Gαi3-(271–354), Gαo-(60–178), Gαo-(60–178), Gαo-(179–354), Gαo-(179–271), and Gαo-(272–354). These cDNA fragments, which contained overlapping sequences in the internal boundaries of the chimeras, were used as templates in successive PCR reactions to generate the full-length chimeras. The full-length chimeras were digested and inserted between the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites of pGEX-4T-1. GST, GST-Gαi3, GST-Gαo, GST-Gαi3/o chimeras, His-Gαi3, His-Gαo, His-GIV-CT, or His-GIV-CTs fusion constructs were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) as described previously (11Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3178-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and induced overnight at 25 °C with 1 mm 1-isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Pelleted bacteria from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 10 ml of GST-lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics)) or His-lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics)) for GST- or His-fused proteins, respectively. After sonication (4 × 20 s, 1 min between cycles), lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Solubilized proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) or HisPur Cobalt Resin (Pierce). Proteins were eluted, dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C. His-Gαi3 and His-Gαo were buffer-exchanged into G protein storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm GDP, 5% (v/v) glycerol) prior to storage at −80 °C. COS7 and HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, and 5% CO2. siRNA transfection of HeLa cells was carried out using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides against human Gαi3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. When reversal of phenotype was attempted, pcDNA3.1-Gαi3 (untagged) transfection was carried out 8–10 h post-siRNA transfection using GeneJuice (Novagen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and cells were analyzed after ∼38–40 h. Transfection of COS7 cells with Gαi3-FLAG was also carried out using GeneJuice. Lysates used as a source for GIV for in vitro protein binding assays or for immunoprecipitation were prepared by resuspending the cells in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 125 mm K(CH3COO), 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with phosphatase (Sigma) and protease (Roche Applied Science) inhibitor mixtures, passed through a 28-gauge needle at 4 °C, and cleared (10,000 × g for 10 min) before use in subsequent experiments. Purified GST fusion proteins or GST alone (5–10 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture) containing either 30 μm GDP or 30 μm GDP, 30 μm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF for 90 min at room temperature. ∼250 μg of COS7 cell lysate or 3 μg of purified His-GIV-CT or His-Gαi3 was added to each tube, and binding reactions were carried out overnight at 4 °C with constant tumbling. Beads were washed (×4) with 1 ml of wash buffer (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, supplemented with GDP or GDP, AlCl3, and NaF as during binding) and boiled in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. COS7 cell lysates (∼1–2 mg of protein) were incubated 4 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by incubation with protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for an additional 60 min. Beads were washed (×4) with 1 ml of wash buffer (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT), and the bound immune complexes were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-LPAR1 the boiling step was omitted. This assay was performed as described previously (11Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3178-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, His-Gαi3 or His-Gαo (100 nm) was preincubated with different concentrations of His-GIV-CTs-(1660–1870), for 15 min at 30 °C in assay buffer (20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% (w/v) C12E10). GTPase reactions were initiated at 30 °C by adding an equal volume of assay buffer containing 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (∼50 cpm/fmol). Duplicate aliquots (50 μl) were removed at 10 min, and reactions were stopped with 950 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/v) activated charcoal in 20 mm H3PO4, pH 3. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and 500 μl of the resultant supernatant was scintillation-counted to quantify released [32P]Pi. To determine the specific Pi produced, the background [32P]Pi detected at 10 min in the absence of G protein was subtracted from each reaction. The % reduction in G protein activation of Gαo and Gαi3 mutants compared with wt Gαi3 was determined using the formula, 100 − [100*(x − 1)/(y − 1)], where x is the -fold increase in G protein activity for Gαo and Gαi3 mutants and y is the -fold increase for wt Gαi3. This assay was performed as previously described (25Krumins A.M. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, His-Gαi3 (500 nm) was loaded for 30 min at 30 °C with GTP in the absence of magnesium to prevent the hydrolysis of the nucleotide (20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 4 μm [γ-32P]GTP (∼100 cpm/fmol)). After transferring the tubes to ice, the reaction was initiated by diluting ten times the GTP-loaded G protein with assay buffer (20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 8, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm GTP, 0.05% (w/v) C12E10) containing the desired amount of protein to be tested (His-GIV-CTs, 2 μm, GST-GAIP, 1 μm, or equal volume of buffer in the control reaction). The reactions were carried out on ice. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed at different time points (0, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 s), and reactions were stopped with 950 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/v) activated charcoal in 20 mm H3PO4, pH 3. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and 500 μl of the resultant supernatant was scintillation-counted to quantify released [32P]Pi. To determine the specific Pi produced, the background [32P]Pi detected at 0 s was subtracted from each reaction. GTPγS binding was measured using a filter binding method (8Afshar K. Willard F.S.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-Gαi3 (100 nm) was preincubated with different concentrations of wild-type His-GIV-CTs-(1660–1870) or His-GIV-CTs-(1660–1870) F1685A mutant, for 15 min at 30 °C in assay buffer (20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% (w/v) C12E10). Reactions were initiated at 30 °C by adding an equal volume of assay buffer containing 1 μm [35S]GTPγS (∼50 cpm/fmol). Duplicate aliquots (50 μl) were removed at 15 min, and binding of radioactive nucleotide was stopped by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2). The quenched reactions were rapidly passed through BA-85 nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with 4 ml wash buffer. Filters were dried and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. To determine the specific nucleotide binding, the background [35S]GTPγS detected in the absence of G protein was subtracted from each reaction. His-Gαi3, His-Gαo, or the indicated His-Gαi3 mutants (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated for 120 min at 30 °C in the presence of GDP (30 μm) or GDP·AlF4− (30 μm GDP, 30 μm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF). After incubation, trypsin was added to the tubes (final concentration, 12.5 μg/ml), and samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Proteins samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% nonfat milk (or 5% bovine serum albumin when probing for Akt) before sequential incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. Infrared imaging with two-color detection was performed using an Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Primary antibodies were diluted as follows: anti-GIV (coiled-coil), 1:500; anti-AGS3, 1:1000; anti-His, 1:2000; anti-panGβ, 1:200; anti-pAkt (S473), 1:200; anti-Akt, 1:400; and anti-α-tubulin, 1:2500. Scratch wound assays were done as described previously (18Ghosh P. Garcia-Marcos M. Bornheimer S.J. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-mm wounds were created in monolayer cell cultures (∼100% confluent) with a 1-ml sterile pipette tip, and the cells were subsequently monitored by phase-contrast microscopy over the succeeding 24 h. To quantify cell migration (expressed as % wound area covered), images were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) software to calculate the difference between the wound area at 0 h and at the end of the migration assay divided by the area at 0 h × 100. Experiments were repeated at least three times, and results were presented either as one representative experiment or as mean ± S.E. when data from multiple independent experiments were pooled. Statistical significance between various conditions was assessed with the Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. In our previous work (11Garcia-Marcos M. Ghosh P. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3178-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that GIV was capable of increasing the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαi3. The steady-state GTP hydrolysis by Gα subunits is a reaction with two major steps, nucleotide exchange (i.e. release of GDP and loading of GTP) and GTP hydrolysis. The GTP hydrolysis step is 10- to 100-fold faster than the nucleotide exchange step. For this reason nucleotide exchange is rate-limiting for the steady-state GTPase reaction (27Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 350-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because GIV increases the steady-state GTPase activity of Gαi3 and this activity directly depends on the rate of nucleotide exchange, we proposed that GIV is a GEF for Gαi subunits. To rule out an effect of GIV on GTP hydrolysis we performed single-turnover GTPase assays. Under these experimental conditions the nucleotide exchange step is bypassed and the GTPase activity depends solely on the rate of GTP hydrolysis (28Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We measured the single-turnover GTPase activity of purified His-Gαi3 in the absence or presence of GIV-CTs-(1660–1870) (“s” stands for “short”), which contains the GEF motif of GIV. His-GIV-CTs was used, because it behaves the same as His-GIV-CT-(1623–1870) (13Nishimura A. Okamoto M. Sugawara Y. Mizuno N. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 487-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in terms of its binding to Gαi3 (data not shown) and modulation of steady-state GTPase activity (Fig. 1A) but gives greater protein yields in E. coli. As a positive control we used GST-GAIP, a well characterized GAP (1De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) that accelerates the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαi subunits. GST-GAIP dramatically increased the single-turnover GTPase activity of Gαi3, whereas GIV-CTs had no effect (Fig. 1B) even at concentrations (2 μm) that provoke a maximal increase of the steady-state GTPase activity (Fig. 1A). This result demonstrates that GIV does not affect GTP hydrolysis in the steady-state GTPase reaction. To further validate the role of GIV as a GEF, we performed GTPγS binding experiments,"
https://openalex.org/W2062466157,"Selenium chemoprevention by apoptosis has been well studied, but it is not clear whether selenium can activate early barriers of tumorigenesis, namely senescence and DNA damage response. To test this hypothesis, we treated normal and cancerous cells with a gradient concentration of sodium selenite, methylseleninic acid and methylselenocysteine for 48 h, followed by a recovery of 1–7 days. Here we show that selenium compounds at doses of ≤LD50 can induce cellular senescence, as evidenced by the expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation, in normal but not cancerous cells. In response to clastogens, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein is rapidly activated, which in turn initiates a cascade of DNA damage response. We found that the ATM pathway is activated by the selenium compounds, and the kinase activity is required for the selenium-induced senescence response. Pretreatment of the MRC-5 non-cancerous cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl suppresses the selenium-induced ATM activation and senescence. Taken together, the results suggest a novel role of selenium in the activation of early tumorigenesis barriers specific in non-cancerous cells, whereby selenium induces an ATM-dependent senescence response that depends on reactive oxygen species.

Genome instability is a hallmark of carcinogenesis. Recent advances suggest that major barriers of human tumorigenesis at the early stage include DNA damage response and senescence (1Bartkova J.

Heritable mutations in ATM cause ataxia telangiectasia, a genomic instability syndrome characterized by cancer predisposition, neurodegeneration, and premature aging. In response to DNA damage, the ATM kinase is rapidly activated and mediates multiple downstream pathways, resulting in DNA damage checkpoint response and repair. ATM pathway activation in humans requires ATM phosphorylation at Ser-1981 (4Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cellular senescence, a form of cell cycle withdrawal, can limit the proliferation of cells with persistent genomic instability. In the MRC-5 diploid fibroblasts expressing mos, the oncogene-induced senescence can be suppressed by inhibition of ATM, suggesting that ATM plays a major role linking pathways of senescence and DNA damage response during early tumorigenesis (2Bartkova J.

Selenium is an essential trace mineral widely distributed in inorganic forms in soil and in organic forms in certain foods.

Nonetheless, a consensus drawn from the two trials is that selenium supplementation prevents cancer risks only in men entering the trial with suboptimal levels of body selenium. Thus, it is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of tumorigenesis suppression offered by selenium. Metabolites of selenium compounds have been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesSA-β-galactosidasesenescence-associated β-galactosidaseBrdUrd5-bromo-2-deoxyuridineMSeAmethylseleninic acidMSeCmethylselenocysteineNACN-acetylcysteinePBSphosphate-buffered salineDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolepATMphosphorylated ATMSASPsenescence-associated secretory phenotypeTempo2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl. which in turn can induce oxidative modifications and breaks on DNA. Previous studies have focused on selenium-induced stress responses in various cultured cancer cells, from which it is suggested that much of the role of selenium in cancer prevention is attributable to ROS-induced apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in cancer cells (11Li S.

Consistent with this notion, it has been shown that selenium-induced apoptosis in cancer cells can be suppressed by antioxidants (14Shen C.L. Song W. Pence B.C. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2001; 10: 385-390PubMed Google Scholar) and is p53-dependent (15Zhao R. Domann F.E. Zhong W. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 3275-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, selenium can sensitize cancer cells to other apoptotic inducers, including TRAIL and doxorubicin (11Li S. Zhou Y. Wang R. Zhang H. Dong Y. Ip C. Mol.

Available evidence from the literature has not provided a full understanding of selenium in tumorigenesis or the linkage of selenium metabolites to genomic maintenance (17Cheng W.H. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2009; 50: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is known that selenium-induced oxidative stress or DNA damage can lead to apoptosis in some cancer cells (18Zhou N. Xiao H. Li T.K. Nur-E-Kamal A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29532-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); however, the roles of selenium in cellular senescence have not been studied. To investigate additional barriers of tumorigenesis elicited by selenium, we treated the MRC-5 normal lung fibroblasts, the CRL-1790 normal colon fibroblasts, and the PC-3 prostate and HCT 116 colon cancer cells with selenium compounds of organic and inorganic origins in a series of studies. We employed a number of senescence markers, including the measurement of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-galactosidase) expression and levels of the pulse-labeled 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd), together with investigating the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway, to explore a role of selenium in the activation of early tumorigenesis barriers. Our results indicate that selenium induces an ATM-dependent senescence response via redox regulation in non-cancerous but not in cancerous cells, suggesting a novel mechanism of selenium in counteracting tumorigenesis. The MRC-5 normal lung fibroblasts (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ), CRL-1790 normal colon fibroblasts, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 ng/ml essential amino acid, 1 ng/ml nonessential amino acid, 1 ng/ml vitamins, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The HCT 116 colon cancer cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Sodium selenite (Na2SeO3), methylseleninic acid (MSeA), methylselenocysteine (MSeC), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempo) were obtained from Sigma and were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). KU55933 and NU 7026 were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO) and were dissolved in DMSO. The cells were treated with the selenium compounds for 48 h and washed once with PBS, followed by a 1–7-day recovery. We detected SA-β-galactosidase by using a senescence detection kit (MBL Co. Ltd., Woburn, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded onto 24-well plates with a density of 5,000 cells/well and treated with the selenium compounds for 48 h, followed by a 7-day recovery. The cells were washed once in PBS, fixed at room temperature for 15 min, washed three times in PBS, and stained in the staining solution containing X-gal at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for 8 h. Cells were then overlaid with 70% glycerol and observed under a light microscope. We performed a BrdUrd incorporation assay to indicate status of DNA replication. Cells were cultured on coverslips and incubated with Na2SeO3 (1 μm), MSeA (1 μm) and MSeC (50 μm) for 48 h followed by a 7-day recovery. Cells were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 1 h, followed by washing three times in PBS and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 30 min. The fixed cells were then permeabilized in HCl (0.1 n) containing pepsin (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was denatured by HCl (1.5 n) for 15 min and then by sodium borate (0.1 m) for 5 min. After washing three times in PBS, the cells were incubated in an anti-BrdUrd antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen). A drop of ProLong® gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen) was added to a slide, and then coverslips were mounted on the slides. We employed filter cube set 49 (excitation, 365 nm; filter, 395 nm; emission, 445 nm) and set 38 (excitation, 470 nm; filter, 495 nm; emission, 525 nm) for visualization of DAPI and fluorescein isothiocyanate, respectively, through a Zeiss AxioObserver 100 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). All of the photomicrographs were taken using the same magnification scale (×200) and exposure time (400 ms) within 10 min to avoid autofading of the fluorescence signal. Cells were seeded onto coverslips and incubated with Na2SeO3 (1–2 μm), MSeA (1–2 μm), and MSeC (50–100 μm) for 2 days, followed by a 0–7-day recovery. The cells were washed three times in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 30 min, permeabilized in 90% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C, and washed three times in PBS (5 min/wash). The cells were then incubated in 0.3% Triton-X for 15 min and washed three times in PBS. Cells were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with antibodies against H2AX (1:2000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), γH2AX (phospho-H2AX on Ser-139, 1:2000; Abcam), ATM (1:2000; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA), and anti-phospho-ATM on Ser-1981 (pATM Ser-1981, 1:2000; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). After washing, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescence dyes (Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit lgG and Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse lgG, Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at room temperature. A drop of ProLong® Gold antifade reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen) was added to a slide, and the coverslips were mounted onto the slide. The slides were then placed under a Zeiss AxioObserver 100 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) for image acquisition. The fluorescence signals were visualized by using filter cube set 49 for DAPI (excitation 365 nm, filter 395 nm, and emission 445 nm), filter cube set 38 for GFP (excitation 470 nm, filter 495 nm, and emission 525 nm), and filter cube set 43 for DsRed (excitation 550 nm, filter 570 nm, and emission 605 nm). All of the photos were taken using the same magnification scale (×630) and exposure time (100 ms for DAPI, 400 ms for GFP, and 800 ms for DsRed), followed by deconvolution according to the manufacturer's instruction. The ATM phosphorylated at Ser-1981 (pATM Ser-1981) and γH2AX focus-positive cells are defined as those containing at least five foci (19Camphausen K. Brady K.J. Burgan W.E. Cerra M.A. Russell J.S. Bull E.E. Tofilon P.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 409-416PubMed Google Scholar). Five pictures were randomly taken from each slide. All experiments were run in duplication and performed a minimum of three times. Cells were cultured in 10-cm2 dishes and treated with 1–2 μm Na2SeO3, 1–2 μm MSeA, and 50–100 μm MSeC for 48 h, followed by a 1–7-day recovery. The cell monolayers were rinsed with PBS, incubated in trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, and fixed and stored in 70% ethanol at −20 °C until analysis. Prior to the analysis, cells were stained in propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) containing RNase. The DNA was then analyzed by a FACScalibur cytometer with the CELLQuest program (BD Biosciences). ModFit LT (version 3.0, Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) was applied for cell cycle analysis on overlaid histograms. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 10,000 MRC-5 cells, 5,000 PC-3 cells, and 5,000 HCT 116 cells per 3.5-mm well, incubated with the selenium compounds at the aforementioned dosages for 48 h, followed by a 7-day recovery. On day 7, the cells were washed once with PBS and then trypsinized. Cells were transferred to the INCYTO C-Chip disposable hemacytometers (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA), and the cell number was counted under a light microscope. The data were analyzed by using the SAS version 9.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A two-tailed Student's t test was applied to determine statistical significance between the treatments and the control. The linear regression was also computed to confirm the senescence response to gradient concentrations of selenium in Fig. 1 (p < 0.0001). To determine whether or not selenium can counteract tumorigenesis through cancer barriers other than the well studied apoptosis, we first assessed senescence phenotypes after cellular exposure to the selenium compounds. MRC-5, CRL-1790, PC-3, and HCT 116 cells were treated with Na2SeO3 (0.1–10 μm), MSeA (0.1–10 μm), and MSeC (5–500 μm) for 2 days, followed by a 7-day recovery in normal medium in the absence of the selenium treatment. The cells were then subjected to the detection of SA-β-galactosidase, a hallmark of cellular senescence. The selenium treatment resulted in the expression of SA-β-galactosidase in the non-cancerous MRC-5 and CRL-1790 cells in a dose-dependent manner (by regression analysis, p < 0.0001) from a concentration as low as 0.1 μm (Na2SeO3 or MSeA) and 5 μm (MSeC) (Fig. 1, A–C, and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Strikingly, there was no detectable SA-β-galactosidase in the cancerous PC-3 and HCT 116 cells (Fig. 1, A–C, and supplemental Figs. 3 and 4) treated with selenium at doses that result in the majority of the MRC-5 cells senescing (2 μm for Na2SeO3 and MSeA; 100 μm for MSeC) or even higher doses. To confirm the selenium-induced senescence, we measured the rate of BrdUrd incorporation, an indicator of DNA replication. The selenium-treated cells were pulse-labeled with BrdUrd, which can be incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA during S phase of the cell cycle. Compared with the MRC-5 cells without selenium treatment, cellular exposure to Na2SeO3, MSeA, and MSeC resulted in a 4-, 6.6-, and 2.3-fold reduction in BrdUrd incorporation, respectively (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. 5). Thus, treatment of MRC-5 cells with the selenium compounds resulted in DNA replication suppression, a feature of cellular senescence. Taken together, selenium compounds induce cellular senescence in the non-cancerous but not in the cancerous cells. We next performed survival assays to determine the cellular sensitivity to the selenium compounds and estimate their respective LD50 values. Results from the cell proliferation analysis showed that PC-3 and HCT 116 cancerous cells are more resistant than MRC-5 cells to treatment with Na2SeO3 (Fig. 2A), MSeA (Fig. 2B), and MSeC (Fig. 2C) at day 7. When the two cancerous cell lines were treated with doses of selenium equivalent to their respective LD50 range, there was no SA-β-galactosidase detected (Fig. 1, A–C, and supplemental Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast, treatment of MRC-5 cells with selenium at doses comparable with their LD50 resulted in significant SA-β-galactosidase expression. Moreover, there was no increase in sub-G1 cell population 3 days after cellular exposure to the selenium compounds (supplemental Table 1), suggesting that an apoptotic cell death pathway is not activated. The results further support the observation that the selenium-induced senescence occurs specifically in non-cancerous cells; cancerous cells are deficient in selenium-induced senescence. ATM activation and DNA damage response occur in senescent cells at an early stage of tumorigenesis (1Bartkova J. Horejsí Z. Koed K. Krämer A. Tort F. Zieger K. Guldberg P. Sehested M. Nesland J.M.

Nur-E-Kamal A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29532-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because pATM Ser-1981 is known as a marker of ATM pathway activation in response to DNA breaks and other types of damage in humans (4Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar), we tested whether selenium can induce pATM Ser-1981 formation in MRC-5 cells by immunofluorescence studies. Treatment of MRC-5 cells with Na2SeO3 (0–2 μm; Fig. 3A), MSeA (0–2 μm; Fig. 3B), and MSeC (0–100 μm; Fig. 3C) resulted in a significant increase in pATM Ser-1981 focus-positive cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The ATM protein was localized in the nucleus at a comparable level in either the presence or absence of the selenium treatment (Fig. 3G). Co-treating MRC-5 cells with the selenium compounds and the ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933 (20Cheng W.H. Muftic D. Muftuoglu M. Dawut L. Morris C. Helleday T. Shiloh Y. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suppressed the selenium-induced pATM Ser-1981 focus formation (supplemental Fig. 6), providing proof of evidence for the assay. H2AX phosphorylation at Ser-139 (known as γH2AX) is a marker of DNA breaks and is known as a substrate of several kinases, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family members ATM and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) (18Zhou N. Xiao H. Li T.K. Nur-E-Kamal A. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29532-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Stiff T. O'Driscoll M. Rief N. Iwabuchi K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether the selenium compounds can induce γH2AX formation. Analysis of the immunofluorescent results indicated that treatment of MRC-5 cells with Na2SeO3 (1–2 μm; Fig. 3D), MSeA (1–2 μm; Fig. 3E), and MSeC (50–100 μm; Fig. 3F) resulted in significant increases in the population of cells expressing γH2AX foci, the extent of which is comparable between days 3 and 7 post-treatment. To determine whether ATM kinase activity is involved in the increased γH2AX focus formation, we co-treated the MRC-5 cells with the selenium compounds and KU55933 (20Cheng W.H. Muftic D. Muftuoglu M. Dawut L. Morris C. Helleday T. Shiloh Y. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent analyses of γH2AX foci showed that KU55933 marginally suppresses γH2AX focus formation in the selenium-treated MRC-5 cells (Fig. 3, H–J, and supplemental Fig. 7), suggesting that ATM is not the major kinase attributable to the selenium-induced γH2AX focus formation. We next co-treated the MRC-5 cells with the selenium compounds and NU 7026, a kinase inhibitor of DNA-PKcs. Compared with KU55933, treatment of the cells with NU 7026 resulted in a more robust suppression in the selenium-induced γH2AX focus formation (Fig. 3, H–J). Interestingly, the effect of KU55933 and NU 7026 on the inhibition of selenium-induced γH2AX focus formation appears to be additive. Thus, ATM is not the major kinase involved in the selenium-induced γH2AX focus formation in MRC-5 cells. Cancer cells are characterized by genomic instability and increased oxidative stress (23Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 24Duensing S. Münger K. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25Valko M. Rhodes C.J. Moncol J. Izakovic M. Mazur M. Chem. Biol.

Thus, we assessed pATM Ser-1981 and γH2AX expression in PC-3 cells, which is negative in selenium-induced senescence (Fig. 1, A–C, and supplemental Fig. 3). Compared with the non-cancerous MRC-5 cells, there were significantly greater PC-3 cell populations exhibiting intrinsic pATM Ser-1981 (58.4 versus 4.7%; Fig. 3, A versus K) and γH2AX (85.0 versus 33.3%; Fig. 3, D versus L) foci in the absence of selenium treatment. Although 7 days after recovery from treatment with Na2SeO3 (1 μm), MSeA (1 μm), and MSeC (50 μm), PC-3 cells showed an increase in cells containing pATM Ser-1981 foci, the extent of induction is much smaller (43% versus 14.6-fold) as compared with the non-cancerous MRC-5 cells. Noticeably, the PC-3 cells exhibit high levels of intrinsic γH2AX foci, and treatment of the cells with selenium did not further increase γH2AX expression (Fig. 3L). Thus, the PC-3 prostate cancer cells are predisposed to genomic instability, which may prevent the cells from responding to the selenium treatment for the activation of senescence and the ATM tumor-suppressing pathways. A previous report indicates that senescent MRC-5 cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle 7–10 days after cellular exposure to H2O2 at a concentration of 500 mm (27von Kobbe C. May A. Grandori C. Bohr V.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1970-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured MRC-5 cell cycle profiles 1, 3, and 7 days post-treatment of the selenium compounds. We found that 1 and 3 days after recovery from treatment with MSeA and MSeC resulted in significant increases in MRC-5 cells in the S and G2/M population, followed by cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase at day 7 in cells treated with Na2SeO3, MSeA, or MSeC (supplemental Tables 2–4). The G1 cell cycle arrest in MRC-5 cells after selenium treatment is consistent with the observation of the selenium-induced senescence phenotype. To determine whether ATM kinase activity is required for the selenium-induced senescence, we preincubated the MRC-5 cells with KU55933. Results from the SA-β-galactosidase analysis demonstrated that inhibition of ATM kinase activity prevented senescence induction in MRC-5 cells exposed to Na2SeO3 (1 μm), MSeA (1 μm), or MSeC (50 μm) (Fig. 4). The ATM kinase inhibitor also prevented senescence induction in MRC-5 cells exposed to lower doses of the selenium compounds (data not shown). The results indicated that ATM kinase activity is required for the induction of senescence by the selenium compounds in MRC-5 cells. It has been shown"
https://openalex.org/W2016240897,"The reversible association and dissociation of a metabolic multi-enzyme complex participating in de novo purine biosynthesis, the purinosome, was demonstrated in live cells to respond to the levels of purine nucleotides in the culture media. We also took advantage of in vitro proteomic scale studies of cellular substrates of human protein kinases (e.g. casein kinase II (CK2) and Akt), that implicated several de novo purine biosynthetic enzymes as kinase substrates. Here, we successfully identified that purinosome formation in vivo was significantly promoted in HeLa cells by the addition of small-molecule CK2-specific inhibitors (i.e. 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole, 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole, tetrabromocinammic acid, 4,4',5,5',6,6'-hexahydroxydiphenic acid 2,2',6,6'-dilactone (ellagic acid) as well as by silencing the endogenous human CK2alpha catalytic subunit with small interfering RNA. However, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole, another CK2-specific inhibitor, triggered the dissociation of purinosome clusters in HeLa cells. Although the mechanism by which 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole affects purinosome clustering is not clear, we were capable of chemically reversing purinosome formation in cells by the sequential addition of two CK2 inhibitors. Collectively, we provide compelling cellular evidence that CK2-mediated pathways reversibly regulate purinosome assembly, and thus the purinosome may be one of the ultimate targets of kinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2032503508,"FREQUENCY (FRQ) is the central component of the Neurospora circadian clock. All FRQ proteins form the FFC complex with FRH (FRQ-interacting RNA helicase) that acts as the negative element in the circadian negative feedback loop by repressing frq mRNA levels. To understand the function of the FRQ-FRH interaction, we mapped and identified the minimal FRQ region that is required for FRQ-FRH interaction. We demonstrated that the FRQ-FRH complex formation is required for the interaction between FRQ and the White Collar Complex (WCC) and clock function. On the other hand, in the FRQ-FRH complex, FRQ is also required for the FRH-WCC interaction. Disruption of FRQ-FRH interaction or down-regulation of FRH results in hypophosphorylation, rapid degradation of FRQ, as well as low levels of WHITE COLLAR-1 and WHITE COLLAR-2. Furthermore, we showed that the rapid FRQ degradation in the absence of FRH is independent of FWD-1, the ubiquitin E3 ligase of FRQ under normal conditions, thus uncovering an alternative pathway for FRQ degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2003308339,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (Parp-2) belongs to a family of enzymes that catalyse poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins. Parp-2 deficiency in mice (Parp-2(-/-)) results in reduced thymic cellularity associated with increased apoptosis in thymocytes, defining Parp-2 as an important mediator of T-cell survival during thymopoiesis. To determine whether there is a link between Parp-2 and the p53 DNA-damage-dependent apoptotic response, we have generated Parp-2/p53-double-null mutant mice. We found that p53(-/-) backgrounds completely restored the survival and development of Parp-2(-/-) thymocytes. However, Parp-2-deficient thymocytes accumulated high levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), independently of the p53 status, in line with a function of Parp-2 as a caretaker promoting genomic stability during thymocytes development. Although Parp-2(-/-) mice do not have spontaneous tumours, Parp-2 deficiency accelerated spontaneous tumour development in p53-null mice, mainly T-cell lymphomas. These data suggest a synergistic interaction between Parp-2 and p53 in tumour suppression through the role of Parp-2 in DNA-damage response and genome integrity surveillance, and point to the potential importance of examining human tumours for the status of both genes."
https://openalex.org/W2069549119,"Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein structures that cap the ends of chromosomes. Without telomerase, telomeres shorten with replication and eventually signal cell cycle arrest (cell senescence). Homologous recombination (HR)-based mechanisms slow senescence, and distinct HR mechanisms support the growth of the rare survivors of senescence. Here, we report novel roles for the post-translational modification of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in regulating the rate of senescence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase mutants. We identify Mms21 as the relevant SUMO E3 ligase and demonstrate that cells lacking Mms21-dependent sumoylation accumulate HR intermediates selectively at telomeres during senescence. One target of Mms21-dependent sumoylation is the cohesin- and condensin-related Smc5-Smc6 complex (Smc5/6). We show that hypomorphic smc5 or smc6 alleles exhibit phenotypes similar to mms21 sumoylation-deficient mutants with regard to senescence and the accumulation of unresolved HR intermediates. Further, we provide evidence that Mms21 and Smc5/6 prevent aberrant recombination between sister telomeres and also globally facilitate resolution of sister chromatid HR intermediates. Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein structures that cap the ends of chromosomes. Without telomerase, telomeres shorten with replication and eventually signal cell cycle arrest (cell senescence).

Here, we report novel roles for the post-translational modification of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in regulating the rate of senescence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase mutants. We identify Mms21 as the relevant SUMO E3 ligase and demonstrate that cells lacking Mms21-dependent sumoylation accumulate HR intermediates selectively at telomeres during senescence. One target of Mms21-dependent sumoylation is the cohesin- and condensin-related Smc5-Smc6 complex (Smc5/6). We show that hypomorphic smc5 or smc6 alleles exhibit phenotypes similar to mms21 sumoylation-deficient mutants with regard to senescence and the accumulation of unresolved HR intermediates. Further, we provide evidence that Mms21 and Smc5/6 prevent aberrant recombination between sister telomeres and also globally facilitate resolution of sister chromatid HR intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2137807903,"Tumor growth is the orchestration of various oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and the regulation of these genes offers a rational therapeutic approach to cancer treatment. In this study, we found a new regulator of tumor growth, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIα (PI4KIIα), the mechanism of which is involved in angiogenesis and hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α regulation. Results obtained from a human cancer tissue microarray showed that PI4KIIα protein expression increases markedly in seven types of cancers compared with normal tissues. Suppression of PI4KIIα leads to retarded tumor growth in nude mice. Downregulation of PI4KIIα in cancer cells eliminates tumor cell-induced endothelial cell tubulogenesis and migration, and results in impaired angiogenesis. Further investigation showed that PI4KIIα can directly regulate HIF-1α expression and that the expression of these two proteins is correlated in vivo. At the same time, downregulation of PI4KIIα markedly reduces HER-2 autophosphorylation, and PI4KIIα specifically triggers HIF-1α accumulation through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)- and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway, suggesting that PI4KIIα may regulate HIF-1α through the HER-2/PI3K, ERK cascade. In summary, we discovered a pivotal role for PI4KIIα in the regulation of tumor growth. Our results shed new light on understanding the novel functions of PI4KIIα in cancer and suggest that PI4KIIα may be a promising specific target for tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2055320005,"The neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene encodes merlin, a membrane/cytoskeleton protein necessary for the maintenance of contact inhibition of growth in cells. Bi-allelic inactivation of NF2 is known to cause multiple cancers in both humans and mice. However, the mechanism through which merlin exerts its tumor-suppressive function remains obscure. In this report, we show that NF2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts lost contact inhibition of cell proliferation and contained significantly increased canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of Rac1, the activity of which is inversely regulated by NF2, through the use of a dominant-negative mutant, small hairpin RNA or a small molecule inhibitor in NF2-deficient cells, was able to suppress elevated Wnt signals as shown by reduced activity of the T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) transcription factor. Dominant-negative TCF4 or Rac1 mutant, as well as a small molecule inhibition of Wnt, were able to curb NF2 deficiency-elicited cell proliferation at the confluent state. Thus, Rac1-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is essential for the loss of contact inhibition in NF2-deficient cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986920157,"The tumor suppressor gene hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1), which encodes a transcriptional repressor, is epigenetically inactivated in various human cancers. In this study, we show that HIC1 is a direct transcriptional repressor of the gene encoding ephrin-A1, a cell surface ligand implicated in the pathogenesis of epithelial cancers. We also show that mouse embryos lacking both Hic1 alleles manifest developmental defects spatially associated with the misexpression of ephrin-A1, and that overexpression of ephrin-A1 is a feature of tumors arising in Hic1 heterozygous mice in which the remaining wild-type allele is epigenetically silenced. In breast cancer, we find that ephrin-A1 expression is common in vivo, but that in cell culture, expression of the EphA receptors is predominant. Restoration of HIC1 function in breast cancer cells leads to a reduction in tumor growth in vivo, an effect that can be partially rescued by co-overexpression of ephrin-A1. Interestingly, overexpression of ephrin-A1 in vitro triggers downregulation of EphA2 and EphA4 levels, resulting in an expression pattern similar to that seen in vivo. We conclude that Hic1 spatially restricts ephrin-A1 expression in development, and that upregulated expression of ephrin-A1 resulting from epigenetic silencing of HIC1 in cancer cells may be an important mechanism in epithelial malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2001928210,"Almost all neuroblastoma tumors express excess levels of Cyclin D1 (CCND1) compared to normal tissues and other tumor types. Only a small percentage of these neuroblastoma tumors have high-level amplification of the Cyclin D1 gene. The other neuroblastoma tumors have equally high Cyclin D1 expression without amplification. Silencing of Cyclin D1 expression was previously found to trigger differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Overexpression of Cyclin D1 is therefore one of the most frequent mechanisms with a postulated function in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. The cause for the Cyclin D1 overexpression is unknown. Here we show that Cyclin D1 overexpression results from transcriptional upregulation. To identify upstream regulators, we searched in mRNA profiles of neuroblastoma tumor series for transcription factors with expression patterns correlating to Cyclin D1. GATA3 most consistently correlated to Cyclin D1 in four independent data sets. We identified a highly conserved GATA3 binding site 27 bp upstream of the Cyclin D1 transcriptional start. Chromatin immune precipitation confirmed binding of GATA3 to the Cyclin D1 promoter. Overexpression of GATA3 induced Cyclin D1 promoter activity, which decreased after site-directed mutagenesis of the GATA3 binding site in the Cyclin D1 promoter. Silencing of GATA3 resulted in reduced Cyclin D1 promoter activity and reduced Cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, GATA3 silencing caused differentiation that was similar to that caused by Cyclin D1 inhibition. These finding implicate GATA3 in Cyclin D1 overexpression in neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2089797101,"The heptapeptide-nucleotide microcin C (McC) is a potent inhibitor of enteric bacteria growth. McC is excreted from producing cells by the MccC transporter.

Microcins are a class of antibacterial agents produced by Escherichia coli and its close relatives (1Baquero F. Bouanchaud D. Martinez-Perez M.C. Fernandez C. J.

Microcins are produced from ribosomally synthesized peptide precursors. The molecular mass of microcins is below 10 kDa. Some microcin precursors are heavily modified by dedicated maturation enzymes (3Destoumieux-Garzón D. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S.

McC is produced by E. coli cells harboring plasmids carrying the mccABCDE operon (Fig. 1A), which encodes the McC precursor, enzymes necessary for McC synthesis, and proteins that make the cell immune to produced McC. The peptide moiety of McC is encoded by 21-bp-long mccA, the shortest bacterial gene known (7González-Pastor J.E. San Millán J.L. Moreno F.

Mature McC (Fig. 1B) has a molecular mass of 1178 Da and contains a formylated N-terminal methionine, a C-terminal aspartate instead of asparagine encoded by the mccA gene, and an AMP residue attached to the α-carboxyl group of the aspartate through an N-acyl phosphoramidate linkage. The phosphate group is additionally modified by a propylamine group. Once inside sensitive cells, McC is processed, and the product of such processing (Fig. 1B), a non-hydrolyzable analog of aspartyl-adenylate, an intermediate of the reaction catalyzed by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (Fig. 1C), inhibits translation by preventing the synthesis of aminoacylated tRNAAsp by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) 3The abbreviations used are: AspRSaspartyl-tRNA synthetaseIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideAaSAaminoacyl-sulfamoyl-adenosineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyDSAaspartyl-sulfamoyl-adenosineLSAleucyl-sulfamoyl-adenosineESAglutamyl-sulfamoyl-adenosine.

McC processing involves deformylation of the N-terminal Met residue by peptide deformylase, followed by degradation of the peptide moiety by any one of the three broad specificity aminopeptidases, peptidases A, B, and N (10Kazakov T.

Although unprocessed McC has no effect on the aminoacylation reaction, processed McC has no effect on the growth of sensitive cells at concentrations at which intact McC efficiently inhibits growth (9Metlitskaya A.

Because AspRS of McC-producing cells is readily inhibited by processed McC, special mechanisms must exist to ensure that McC production is not deleterious to the producing cell. One such mechanism involves MccC, an export pump that specifically removes McC from the producing cell into the medium. Disruption of mccC in the context of McC-producing plasmid is toxic to the producing cell (8Fomenko D.E. Metlitskaya A.Z. Péduzzi J. Goulard C. Katrukha G.S. Gening L.V. Rebuffat S. Khmel I.A. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2003; 47: 2868-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of mccC alone provides McC resistance to McC-sensitive E. coli cells, indicating that MccC can provide resistance to both internally produced and exogenously added McC. aspartyl-tRNA synthetase isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside aminoacyl-sulfamoyl-adenosine high pressure liquid chromatography aspartyl-sulfamoyl-adenosine leucyl-sulfamoyl-adenosine glutamyl-sulfamoyl-adenosine. McC-producing E. coli cells remain fully viable. This and the Trojan horse mechanism of McC action suggest that MccC could not be the only line of defense against internally produced McC because inevitable accumulation of processed McC in the producing cell cytoplasm should ultimately lead to the inhibition of translation and cell death. Earlier studies indicated that disruption of the mccE gene in the context of McC-producing plasmid makes cells harboring such plasmid very sick (8Fomenko D.E. Metlitskaya A.Z. Péduzzi J. Goulard C. Katrukha G.S. Gening L.V. Rebuffat S. Khmel I.A. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2003; 47: 2868-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), possibly indicating that MccE contributes to McC resistance. In this work, we prove this conjecture and define the molecular mechanism by which MccE contributes to McC immunity. The mccE gene and its fragments encoding MccENTD and MccECTD were amplified by PCR using pUHAB plasmid (12Kazakov T. Metlitskaya A. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2114-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as a template. The upstream primers contained an engineered NdeI site, whereas downstream primers contained a HindIII site that was later used for cloning. Sequences of primers used for amplification are available from the authors upon request. The PCR products were first cloned into pGemT vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmids were selected and treated with NdeI-HindIII, and mccE fragments were cloned into appropriately treated pET28 expression vectors. Site-directed mutagenesis to obtain S553A and E572A substitutions in MccE was carried out by PCR mutagenesis of plasmid pET28-mccECTD using appropriate oligonucleotides following the general procedure described elsewhere (12Kazakov T. Metlitskaya A. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2114-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MccE, MccENTD, MccECTD, and MccECTD(S553A/E572A) was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells that also carried a compatible pG-KJE8 (dnaK-dnaJ-grgE, groES-groEL) plasmid (Takara BIO Inc., Japan). Cells were grown at 30 °C in 300 ml of LB supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml). Overexpression of plasmid-borne mccE was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm IPTG to the medium. l-Arabinose (4 mg/ml) and tetracycline (10 ng/ml) were also added to induce chaperone synthesis. Growth was continued in the presence of inducers for 18 h. The resistance of cells with different plasmids to various compounds on plates was tested by placing 5-μl drops of McC (300 μm), aspartyl-sulfamoyl-adenosine (DSA; 6 mm), leucyl-sulfamoyl-adenosine (LSA; 3 mm), and tetracycline (500 μg/ml) solutions on the surface of LB plates overlaid with 4.5 ml of soft (0.75%) LB agar seeded with 0.1–0.15 ml of induced overnight (A600 ∼2.5) bacterial cultures to be tested. Soft agar used for overlay contained 0.1 mm IPTG. Albomycin sensitivity was tested in liquid cultures using E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET28 vector-based plasmids expressing MccE, wild-type or mutant MccECTD, or cells carrying the pET28 vector alone. Exponentially growing uninduced cultures were diluted with LB medium to A600 = 0.1, and 0.1 μg/ml albomycin was added (zero time point). Because the addition of IPTG was found to affect the growth of some cells, IPTG induction was not used in this experiment. Cell growth was monitored in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml albomycin. Cultures that did not receive albomycin served as controls. To purify recombinant MccE or its domains, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 6 ml of buffer A (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.05 m NaCl) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After a 1-h incubation on ice, cells were disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded on a 1-ml chelating HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+ according to the manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed with buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole, and bound protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The resulting proteins were ∼95% pure as judged by Coomassie staining of SDS gels. Recombinant proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration, glycerol was added to a final concentration 50%, and samples were stored at −20 °C until further use. Acetyltransferase activity was measured using a method described by Bode et al. (13Bode R. Thurau A.M. Schmidt H. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 50 μl of reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA, 110 μm substrates (McC, aminoacyl-sulfamoyl-adenosine (AaSAa), or free amino acids) and a 45 pm concentration of MccE or its domains. Reactions proceeded at room temperature and were terminated by the addition of 150 μl of ethanol and 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) (0.2 mm). 5,5-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) reacts with newly formed free CoA and leads to the increase in A412 as described by Bode et al. (13Bode R. Thurau A.M. Schmidt H. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To measure the reaction rate (pmol of substrate acetylated/min of reaction), the reactions were stopped at different times, and the amount of CoA formed was determined. The amounts of acetylated compounds formed were assumed to be equal to those of free CoA. The absolute amounts (pmol) of free CoA reported by A412 measurements were determined using a standard curve obtained with free CoA purchased from Sigma. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to analyze the acetylation reaction products. The samples were redissolved in 20 μl of methanol/water (1:1), and 100 nl of this mixture was injected directly onto the HPLC system (CapLC, Waters (Milford, MA)). The separation was performed on a hydrophilic interaction column (Grace Alltima HP Hilic, 150 mm × 300 μm (Deerfield, IL)) thermostated at 40 °C. Acetonitrile (HPLC gradient grade; Fisher) was used as organic phase, and 25 mm ammonium formate (pH 6.3) was used as aqueous phase. Flow rate was 5 μl/min, the gradient started at 86% acetonitrile, and the components were eluted by increasing the aqueous phase by 4%/min for 15 min. Electrospray mass spectra were recorded in negative ionization mode on an orthogonal acceleration quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-Tof 2, Micromass (Manchester, UK)). Electrospray capillary voltage was set to −2850 V. Mass spectra (scan time, 0.9 s; interscan delay, 0.1 s; m/z range, 200–550) and fragment ion spectra (scan time, 1.9 s; interscan delay, 0.1 s; m/z range, 50–550) were recorded alternatingly. Argon was used as collision gas, and the collision energy was set to 10 eV, 20 eV, and 15 eV for DSA, LSA, and ESA, respectively. The collision cell voltages were optimized based on the fragmentation pattern of the compounds in such a way that the fragments as well as the precursor ion could be observed simultaneously. E. coli cells were grown to A600 of ∼0.8 in LB medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm KOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cell pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of the same buffer and disrupted using a French press (pressure 1000 bars). The lysate was next centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. Then supernatant was aliquoted and either directly used in tRNA aminoacylation reactions or stored at −80 °C until further use. Aminoacylation reaction was carried out according to the method described by Metlitskaya et al. (9Metlitskaya A. Kazakov T. Kommer A. Pavlova O. Praetorius-Ibba M. Ibba M. Krasheninnikov I. Kolb V. Khmel I. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18033-18042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with some modifications. To 1 μl of solution containing an inhibitor being tested, 3 μl of E. coli S30 extract was added. Next, 16 μl of aminoacylation mixture (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 g/liter bulk E. coli tRNA, 3 mm ATP, 30 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and a 40 μm concentration of the desired labeled amino acid) was added, and reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and precipitated reaction products were collected on Whatman 3MM paper filters. After thorough washing with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, the filters were washed twice with acetone and dried on a heating plate. Following the addition of scintillation liquid, the amount of radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2A, McC was added to S30 extracts prepared from E. coli cells with or without the McC-producing plasmid pUHAB (12Kazakov T. Metlitskaya A. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 2114-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and after a 50-min incubation, which is a sufficient time for McC processing by endogenous peptidases (10Kazakov T. Vondenhoff G.H. Datsenko K.A. Novikova M. Metlitskaya A. Wanner B.L. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 2607-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), AspRS activity was measured. As can be seen, the addition of McC to extracts of cells that did not contain pUHAB led to complete and irreversible inhibition of tRNAAsp aminoacylation by AspRS. In contrast, the inhibition of AspRS activity in extracts of cells carrying pUHAB was incomplete after 50 min, and the activity gradually recovered upon longer incubations. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2B, McC was incubated with S30 extract prepared from cells lacking pUHAB to allow complete processing and combined with fresh extracts prepared from cells with or without pUHAB, and AspRS activity was monitored over time. As can be seen, in extracts without pUHAB, AspRS activity remained constant and low at all time points tested. In contrast, in extracts containing pUHAB, the AspRS activity gradually recovered with time. The result thus indicates that in extracts of McC-producing cells, there exists an activity that detoxifies processed McC. In previous work, we showed that wild-type E. coli cells transformed with a plasmid carrying the mccABCDE operon with a stop codon introduced in the mccE gene do not produce McC (14Metlitskaya A. Kazakov T. Vondenhoff G.H. Novikova M. Shashkov A. Zatsepin T. Semenova E. Zaitseva N. Ramensky V. Van Aerschot A. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, pepA− pepB− pepN− cells harboring such a plasmid produced McC well (14Metlitskaya A. Kazakov T. Vondenhoff G.H. Novikova M. Shashkov A. Zatsepin T. Semenova E. Zaitseva N. Ramensky V. Van Aerschot A. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (recall that pepA− pepB− pepN− cells are unable to process McC). Both types of cells produced McC when carrying a plasmid with intact mccABCDE operon. The reason(s) for this difference remained unknown. We observed that although both plasmids could be introduced into either host with high efficiency, the mutant, mccE−, plasmid but not the wild type, mccE+, plasmid was rapidly lost from the wild-type cells when the culture reached stationary phase, a condition when McC synthesis is induced (15Moreno F. Gónzalez-Pastor J.E. Baquero M.R. Bravo D. Biochimie. 2002; 84: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Fomenko D. Veselovskii A. Khmel I. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, both plasmids were stably maintained in pepA− pepB− pepN− cells (data not shown). The results thus indicate that the product of mccE is necessary for stable maintenance of derepressed mccABCDE operon at conditions when processing of McC by aminopeptidases can occur. McC-producing cells must contain a certain steady-state concentration of McC in their cytoplasm. In the wild-type but not in pepA− pepB− pepN− cells, some intracellular McC should inevitably get processed, leading to AspRS inhibition and cessation of protein synthesis. Experiments presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that cytoplasmic extracts prepared from McC-producing cells contain an activity that inactivates processed McC. Based on the observation that mccE is required for stable maintenance of pUHAB plasmid at conditions of mcc operon expression only when aminopeptidases capable of McC processing are present, we hypothesized that MccE is involved in detoxification of internally processed McC. Below, this hypothesis is shown to be correct, and the molecular mechanism involved is revealed. If MccE were involved in detoxification of McC, then overexpression of mccE would be expected to make cells McC-resistant. Recent papers (17Cursino L. Smajs D. Smarda J. Nardi R.M. Nicoli J.R.

The correction of the sequence led to an ambiguity in the assignment of the mccE start codon, which was originally proposed to begin with an ATG (7González-Pastor J.E. San Millán J.L. Moreno F. Nature. 1994; 369: 281Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Fomenko D.E. Metlitskaya A.Z. Péduzzi J. Goulard C. Katrukha G.S. Gening L.V. Rebuffat S. Khmel I.A. Antimicrob. Agents.

In the corrected sequence, this codon is out of frame with the mccE open reading frame. Cursino et al. (17Cursino L. Smajs D. Smarda J. Nardi R.M. Nicoli J.R. Chartone-Souza E. Nascimento A.M. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2006; 100: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) proposed that in their sequence, a nearby downstream in-frame GTG could serve as a start codon (Fig. 3). Smajs et al. (18Smajs D. Strouhal M. Matejková P. Cejková D. Cursino L. Chartone-Souza E. Smarda J. Nascimento A.M. Plasmid. 2008; 59: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) proposed that translation of MccE is initiated much more upstream, from an ATG codon overlapping with mccD (Fig. 3). For our purposes, it was essential to know the exact starting point of the mccE gene. To this end, several amber mutations were introduced in the “non-coding” sequence between mccD and the previously annotated downstream mccE start sites (MccE codons substituted for amber codons are indicated by asterisks in Fig. 3). The mutant plasmids were introduced into the wild-type and pepA− pepB− pepN− E. coli cells, and McC production was monitored. The results indicated that McC production was only observed when host cells lacked aminopeptidases (data not shown), whereas cells harboring wild-type pUHAB produced McC whether aminopeptidases were present or not, as expected. Thus, plasmids with each of the amber mutations tested behaved as the original mccE− plasmid (above) and therefore destroyed the mccE function. The correct mccE start site must therefore be located upstream of the introduced amber codons and therefore matches the site proposed by Smajs et al. (18Smajs D. Strouhal M. Matejková P. Cejková D. Cursino L. Chartone-Souza E. Smarda J. Nascimento A.M. Plasmid. 2008; 59: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) overlapping with the mccD gene. Overexpression of the “long version” of mccE (starting with an ATG that is located within the mccD gene) from a pET plasmid made McC-sensitive BL21(DE3) E. coli cells resistant to McC (Fig. 4A). In contrast, cells harboring the pET vector remained fully sensitive (Fig. 4A). We therefore conclude that MccE alone can provide resistance to McC, at least when overexpressed. MccE is a two-domain protein; the N-terminal domain (MccENTD) is similar to decarboxylases, and the C-terminal domain (MccECTD) is similar to RimL, an acetylase of ribosomal protein L12 (19Vetting M.W. de Carvalho L.P. Roderick S.L. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22108-22114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although in most bioinformatically identified mcc operons mccE homologs encode a single two-domain protein, in two bacteria, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Synechococcus sp. CC9605, the two domains of the MccE homolog are encoded by separate genes (4Severinov K. Semenova E. Kazakov A. Kazakov T. Gelfand M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1380-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that each domain is independently folded and may possess separate function(s). We created pET-based plasmids expressing individual domains of MccE. The domain boundaries were selected based on sequence comparisons with split homologs from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Synechococcus sp. CC9605. The beginning of MccENTD corresponded to the longest version of MccE (above), and the end was located after Lys407. The N terminus of recombinant MccECTD corresponded to Lys407 of full-sized MccE. Plasmids expressing MccE domains were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and the ability of cells to grow in the presence of McC was determined. Overproduction of MccENTD did not lead to McC resistance (Fig. 4A). In contrast, cells overproducing MccECTD were resistant to McC (Fig. 4A). In the case of MccENTD, the lack of McC resistance was not due to low levels of overproduction and/or poor solubility of the target protein (data not shown). We therefore conclude that overproduction of MccECTD is sufficient for McC resistance. If MccECTD is involved in detoxification of residual processed McC, then one can expect that cells overproducing this domain will also be resistant to DSA, a non-hydrolyzable analog of processed McC (Fig. 1D). Indeed, cells overproducing full-size MccE or MccECTD (but not MccENTD) became resistant to DSA (Fig. 4B). We also tested the ability of cells overproducing MccECTD to grow in the presence of LSA, a non-hydrolyzable leucyl-adenylate analogue inhibiting leucyl-tRNA synthetase (20Finking R. Neumüller A. Solsbacher J. Konz D. Kretzschmar G. Schweitzer M. Krumm T. Marahiel M.A. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells overproducing MccE were partially resistant, whereas cells expressing MccECTD were fully resistant to LSA (Fig. 4B). Control cells harboring pET vector or cells overproducing MccENTD were sensitive. The observed effects were specific because cells overproducing MccE domains were as sensitive to a control antibiotic (tetracycline) as cells containing pET vector (Fig. 4B). Additional experiments showed that overproduction of MccE and/or MccECTD rendered cells resistant to GSA, ASA, FSA, and KSA, sulfamoyl-adenylates containing, respectively, glycyl, alanyl, phenylalanyl, and lysyl aminoacyl moieties (data not shown). The results thus indicate that MccECTD targets processed McC and, more generally, that it is also involved in inactivation of non-hydrolyzable aminoacyl-adenylates containing primary amines, apparently irrespective of the nature of the aminoacyl moiety side chain. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that MccECTD is homologous to bacterial Nα-acetyltransferases of the Rim family (4Severinov K. Semenova E. Kazakov A. Kazakov T. Gelfand M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1380-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Fomenko D.E. Metlitskaya A.Z. Péduzzi J. Goulard C. Katrukha G.S. Gening L.V. Rebuffat S. Khmel I.A. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2003; 47: 2868-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that MccECTD acetylates aminoacyl-adenylates, thus preventing their interaction with (and inhibition of) their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Purified MccECTD was combined with the likely donor of acetyl groups, acetyl-CoA, and DSA, LSA, or ESA substrates (the last compound does not permeate E. coli cells and therefore was not tested in the in vivo experiments described above), and the rate of production of free CoA that should be generated during the acetylation reaction was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results, presented in Table 1, demonstrate that efficient production of CoA from acetyl-CoA was observed when MccECTD and any one of the three AaSAs tested were present in the reaction, consistent with the idea that the MccECTD catalyzes the transfer of acetyl from the acetyl-CoA donor onto AaSA substrates. No CoA production was detected in reactions that contained MccENTD instead of MccECTD (Table 1) or when MccECTD was incubated with McC or free amino acids instead of AaSAs (Table 1). Because the N terminus of McC is blocked by the presence of a formyl group (see Fig. 1B), we also determined whether deformylated McC, McC1149 (14Metlitskaya A. Kazakov T. Vondenhoff G.H. Novikova M.

These studies are the first to show that a MYST KAT contributes to ATM kinase gene expression, further illuminating the mechanism of how ATM kinase is up-regulated to respond to DNA damage. The function of many proteins is regulated by a variety of post-translational modifications. Lysine acetylation is rapidly emerging as a major post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells for a multitude of proteins beyond histones, in which this post-translational modification was first described (1Yang X.J. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar).

MYST family members were initially characterized as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) involved in epigenetically mediated transcription control but have also been implicated in a wide variety of critical cellular functions, including gene regulation, cell cycle progression, and DNA replication (2Utley R.T. Côté J. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

MYST KATs also play a significant role in the cellular response to DNA damage and apoptosis. TIP60, in particular, has been shown to activate ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase through acetylation of lysine 3016 (3Sun Y. Xu Y. Roy K. Price B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8502-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing a “KAT-dead” dominant negative form of TIP60 lacking acetyltransferase activity display defective DNA repair and fail to undergo apoptosis (4Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). If ATM kinase is not activated by acetylation, the cell fails to activate cell cycle checkpoints through phosphorylation of DNA damage response proteins (5Lavin M.F. Birrell G. Chen P. Kozlov S. Scott S. Gueven N. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is also possible that MYST KATs participate in the activation of ATM kinase gene expression by virtue of their HAT activity, but this has not been tested. Insight into the evolution of this vital KAT family is lacking because very little information is available regarding MYST proteins in eukaryotic cells of distal origin. Previously, we have found that the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (phylum Apicomplexa) possesses two MYST KATs, which we have named TgMYST-A and TgMYST-B, that have high similarity to plant MYST KATs (7Saksouk N. Bhatti M.M. Kieffer S. Smith A.T. Musset K. Garin J. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Hakimi M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10301-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Both TgMYST KATs contain an N-terminal chromodomain (CHD) and C2H2 type zinc finger within the MOZ-SAS KAT domain (PF01853). Histone modifications have recently gained much attention in protozoan parasites because they have been linked to modulating critical facets of pathogenesis and have been validated as novel drug targets (6Sullivan Jr., W.J. Naguleswaran A. Angel S.O. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For example, in Toxoplasma, histone modifications have been associated with gene-regulatory events relevant to the clinically important process of parasite differentiation, the process by which rapidly growing tachyzoites convert into latent encysted forms known as bradyzoites (7Saksouk N. Bhatti M.M. Kieffer S. Smith A.T. Musset K. Garin J. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Hakimi M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10301-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized the TgMYST-A KAT (8Smith A.T. Tucker-Samaras S.D. Fairlamb A.H. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that links the KAT activity of TgMYST-B to transcription control, parasite proliferation, and the DNA damage response. We find that Toxoplasma possesses an ATM kinase orthologue that is up-regulated by TgMYST-B; this up-regulation is dependent on the KAT activity of TgMYST-B. Moreover, TgMYST-B is recruited to the ATM kinase gene and protects the parasites from DNA damage. We also present evidence that links the up-regulation of ATM kinase to a slowed growth phenotype observed in parasites overexpressing TgMYST-B. Our results emphasize the importance of TgMYST-B in parasite physiology and heighten its attractiveness as a potential drug target. Toxoplasma tachyzoites used in this study were RH strain and maintained in human foreskin fibroblasts using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1.0% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Parasites were grown in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator at 37 °C. Cultures were routinely monitored for Mycoplasma contamination by MycoAlertTM assay (Cambrex Bio Science). Parasites were harvested immediately following lysis of host cell monolayers and purified by virtue of filtration through a 3.0-μm filter (9Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In some cultures, the ATM kinase inhibitor KU-55933 (Calbiochem catalog number 118500), anacardic acids (Calbiochem catalog number), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; Sigma), or vehicle control (DMSO) was added to the media. Doubling times were determined as described previously (9Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Briefly, T-25 cm2 tissue culture flasks containing confluent monolayers of host cells were inoculated with 105 freshly lysed tachyzoites and incubated. The number of parasites in 50 randomly chosen vacuoles was counted every 8 h. Toxoplasma growth assays based on detection of the parasite-specific B1 gene (10Burg J.L. Grover C.M. Pouletty P. Boothroyd J.C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1989; 27: 1787-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously (11Costa J.M. Pautas C. Ernault P. Foulet F. Cordonnier C. Bretagne S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 2929-2932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well plates were infected with 1,000 parasites/well; each day, genomic DNA from infected wells was harvested using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen) and used in SYBR® Green-based quantitative PCR with the 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The parasite count for a given sample was calculated by interpolation from a standard curve (11Costa J.M. Pautas C. Ernault P. Foulet F. Cordonnier C. Bretagne S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 2929-2932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody was generated in rabbit to a polypeptide sequence corresponding to the C-terminal 100 amino acid residues of TgMYST-B (amino acids 423–523) at Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Raw antiserum was affinity-purified on the peptide immobilized on Affi-Gel-15 (Bio-Rad). Specificity of the affinity-purified antibody was characterized by immunostaining Western blots containing 20 μg of parasite lysate. Antibody to Toxoplasma tubulin (used at 1:1,000) was provided by David Sibley (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) to serve as a protein loading control. Mouse monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated H2AX was from Millipore (05-636) (12Dalmasso M.C. Onyango D.O. Naguleswaran A. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Angel S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody to ATM kinase (2C1 (1A1); used at 1:2,000) was purchased from Abcam (ab78). Appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were employed along with the ECL detection system to visualize results (GE Healthcare). Western blotting for all applications was performed using NuPAGE 4–12% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using MOPS or MES running buffer (Invitrogen). For ATM kinase Western blots, proteins were separated on 4–7% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen). RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using GeneRacer (Invitrogen). Amplified products were gel-purified, subcloned into TA-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on both strands at the Indiana University Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility (GenBankTM accession number AAZ79483). To express and purify recombinant epitope-tagged TgMYST-B from Toxoplasma, we used a FLAG tag affinity chromatography approach as described previously (13Sullivan Jr., W.J. Dixon S.E. Li C. Striepen B. Queener S.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2172-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Donald R.G. Liberator P.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TgMYST-B was cloned into a Toxoplasma expression vector containing the tubulin (TUB) promoter and hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) selection cassette (15Bhatti M.M. Sullivan Jr., W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5902-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol.

The TgMYST-B coding sequences were amplified from Toxoplasma cDNA using a long range PCR kit (Qiagen) and primers containing NdeI and AvrII restriction enzyme sites (in italic type). The 5′ primer also encoded the FLAG epitope tag (underlined): sense, 5′-ATACCATCATATGAAAATGGACTACAAGGACGACGACGACAAGCCTGGCGACTCCGCGTCTCCAGTCTG; antisense, 5′-ATACCATCCTAGGTCAGTCTTCTTCTCCCCGCCTCGGCGGCG. RHΔHX parasites were stably transfected by electroporating 25 μg of the expression vector into 3.0 × 107 parasites, and clones were obtained by limited dilution. fTgMYST-B was purified by sonicating parasite pellets in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340). The parasite lysate was cleared by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C prior to mixing with 40 μl of equilibrated anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity resin (Sigma). The resin and lysate were mixed overnight at 4 °C and spun at 8,200 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was removed, and the resin was washed three times in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol (v/v)) and once with 500 μl of 1× HAT assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate) at 4 °C. fTgMYST-B bound to the resin was used directly in HAT assays as we have done previously (8Smith A.T. Tucker-Samaras S.D. Fairlamb A.H. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To generate the mutant version, fTgMYST-B(E403G), site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® II XL kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blots were performed with anti-FLAG to ensure equal expression between fTgMYST-B(E403G) and fTgMYST-B in the transgenic clones used (data not shown). In vitro HAT assay was performed as previously described (17Bhatti M.M. Livingston M. Mullapudi N. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, FLAG-tagged recombinant protein was purified from Toxoplasma lysates using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for use in an enzymatic HAT reaction containing recombinant H3 peptide as substrate. HAT reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 4× NuPAGE loading dye (Invitrogen) containing 2.0 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated on 4–12% BisTris gel with MES buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with anti-acetyl lysine (Assay Designs/Stressgen catalog number KAP-TF 120H, used at a 1:1,000 dilution). Densitometry values were determined using Kodak 1D version 3.6.3 software (Scientific Imaging System). Tachyzoites were allowed to infect human foreskin fibroblast monolayers grown on glass coverslips. Immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) were carried out as described by Bhatti and Sullivan (15Bhatti M.M. Sullivan Jr., W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5902-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using a 1:100 dilution of affinity-purified anti-TgMYST-B, a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma F7425), or a 1:4,000 dilution of SAG1 as primary antibody. Secondary antibody consisted of anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen). Extracellular tachyzoites were examined after coating coverslips with 50 μl of 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine. Parasites in 3% paraformaldehyde and PBS were inoculated onto the coated coverslips and allowed to sit at room temperature for 15 min before being processed for IFA as outlined above. For IFAs, 0.3 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was applied for 5 min at room temperature in the dark as a co-stain. Preparations of Toxoplasma were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.25 m HEPES (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature and then in 8% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. For immunolabeling, samples were processed as described (18Narasimhan J. Joyce B.R. Naguleswaran A. Smith A.T. Livingston M.R. Dixon S.E. Coppens I. Wek R.C. Sullivan Jr., W.J. J. Biol.

Primers were designed using the Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and are listed in Supplemental Table S1. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using 1.0 μg of total RNA isolated from tachyzoites, oligo(dT) primers, and Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions. 1 μl of a 1:10 dilution of the resulting cDNA was amplified in a 25-μl total volume containing SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, CA) and 0.5 μm of each forward and reverse primer. The Toxoplasma β-tubulin gene (GenBankTM accession number M20025) was used to normalize the real-time reverse transcription-PCR (18Narasimhan J. Joyce B.R. Naguleswaran A. Smith A.T. Livingston M.R.

All reactions were performed in triplicate, using the 7500 real-time PCR system and analyzed SDS software version 1.2.1 (Applied Biosystems). ChIP was performed on tachyzoites stably expressing fMYST-B using polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma F7425) immobilized to Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed as described above. Immunoprecipitated DNA samples were normalized using a standard curve created with serially diluted input DNA. 0.1 ng of total ChIP DNA was added to each reaction, and reactions were performed in triplicate. Primers used for this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Previously, we reported a partial coding sequence for a second MYST family KAT in Toxoplasma, termed TgMYST-B (GenBankTM accession number AAZ79483) (8Smith A.T. Tucker-Samaras S.D. Fairlamb A.H. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have used 5′- and 3′-RACE to acquire the full-length sequence (supplemental Fig. S1). A single amplicon from a nested 5′-RACE reaction was sequenced to reveal an in-frame ATG and 5′-UTR of 133 nt. Interestingly, the 5′-UTR contains a single intron of 358 nt. The 3′-RACE product confirmed the previously reported stop codon and revealed the 533-nt 3′-UTR. The TgMYST-B genomic locus is 4.7 kb, containing seven introns and eight exons. Our results indicate that the coding sequence of TgMYST-B is 1,572 nt, which is in agreement with the ToxoDB 3.0 prediction, TgTwinScan_2400, not the latest 3,264-nt gene prediction at ToxoDB (TGGT1_023320). The discrepancy between the TGGT1_023320 prediction and our cloning results resides at the 5′-end of the gene. Consequently, we performed reverse transcription-PCRs using primers designed to clarify the sequence of the 5′-end of TgMYST-B. Although products downstream of the transcriptional start site we determined by 5′-RACE could be amplified, no amplicons could be generated upstream of this (data not shown). Additionally, no expressed sequence tags or proteomics data to date support the longer TGGT1_023320 prediction. According to our cloning results, the deduced amino acid sequence of TgMYST-B yields a protein composed of 523 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼60 kDa. Protein structure and motif analysis shows that TgMYST-B possesses the expected domains, including the MYST catalytic domain, and an upstream C2H2 zinc finger and CHD (Fig. 1A). BLASTp analysis reveals that the closest matches are MYST acetyltransferases from fellow apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium spp. and plant species including Ricinus communis (castor bean) and Arabidopsis thaliana (<e−86). In a phylogenetic analysis, TgMYST-B groups with a MYST KAT in Cryptosporidium parvum, whereas TgMYST-A is more similar to a MYST KAT in Plasmodium species (Fig. 1B). Protein sequence alignments between TgMYST KATs and those found in other select species are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. The aforementioned MYST KAT motifs are well conserved between TgMYST-A and -B, but the intervening sequences and N-terminal sequence were less so (supplemental Fig. S3). Additionally, there are two insertions in TgMYST-B that are not present in TgMYST-A between the CHD and zinc finger/MYST domain; the first is basic-rich and composed of 55 amino acids, and the second is composed of 24 amino acids. Affinity-purified, polyclonal antibody generated against the C-terminal 100 amino acids (amino acids 423–523) recognizes a single protein of the expected size (∼60 kDa) on an immunoblot containing Toxoplasma tachyzoite lysate; no cross-reactivity to either form of TgMYST-A (49–53 kDa) was detected (Fig. 1C). The protein size supports our cloning data for the true TgMYST-B transcript. We sought to confirm that TgMYST-B exhibited the expected enzymatic activity using an in vitro HAT assay as described previously (17Bhatti M.M. Livingston M. Mullapudi N. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Native TgMYST-B is expressed at very low levels, making it difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of enzyme for analysis. Therefore, we engineered a transgenic clone stably expressing an ectopic form of TgMYST-B under control of the strong Toxoplasma tubulin promoter; the recombinant TgMYST-B was tagged with FLAG at the N terminus (fTgMYST-B). fTgMYST-B was purified from parasite lysate using anti-FLAG resin. fTgMYST-B served as the enzyme source in an in vitro HAT assay that uses recombinant H3 as substrate. After incubation, the HAT reaction was resolved on SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. Acetylated H3 was detected with antibody raised against acetylated lysine. The results verify that TgMYST-B is capable of acetylating histone substrate in vitro (Fig. 2A). The point-mutated version of TgMYST-B (E403G) is described in detail below. To determine the subcellular localization of TgMYST-B, we used our affinity-purified polyclonal antibody in IFAs of intracellular Toxoplasma. Results indicate that TgMYST-B appears to be predominantly cytoplasmic with virtually no protein detectable in the nucleus or apicoplast in either intracellular or extracellular tachyzoites (Fig. 2B). Predominantly cytosolic distribution was also seen in transgenic parasites stably expressing ectopic fTgMYST-B (Fig. 2C). For better resolution, we used the anti-MYST-B antibody in immune electron microscopy of intracellular wild type tachyzoites. Density (gold particles/μm2) of labeled structures was determined from 22–26 cellular cryosections. Percentage of cytosolic and intranuclear density was determined from the sum of gold density normalized for the variation in expression of TgMYST-B. Results confirm the cytosolic location for the majority of TgMYST-B (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S4) but also revealed 20% of gold particles to be in the nuclei of the parasites, consistent with the well characterized HAT activity for a member of the MYST family. The mammalian MYST HAT TIP60 has been linked with the DNA damage response (19Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We found that parasites containing extra TgMYST-B are significantly more resistant to the alkylating DNA-damaging agent MMS (Fig. 3A). To test if the protection against MMS is dependent on the KAT activity of TgMYST-B, we stably expressed a point mutant (E403G) version deficient in catalytic activity (20Decker P.V. Yu D.Y. Iizuka M. Qiu Q. Smith M.M. Genetics. 2008; 178: 1209-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Parasites expressing the mutant form of TgMYST-B are no longer protected from MMS (Fig. 3A). At the higher level of MMS (500 μm), the parasites harboring mutant TgMYST-B are even more susceptible to DNA damage than wild type, suggesting that the mutant is exerting a dominant negative effect as previously reported for TIP60 (4Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) and further supporting a link between TgMYST-B and the DNA damage response. The DNA damage response in eukaryotic cells is strongly correlated with an increased level of histone H2AX phosphorylation (21Escargueil A.E. Soares D.G. Salvador M. Larsen A.K. Henriques J.A. Mutat. Res. 2008; 658: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated in response to double-stranded breaks (termed γH2AX), which are induced by MMS. We have established that Toxoplasma contains H2AX that becomes phosphorylated in response to double-stranded DNA breaks (12Dalmasso M.C. Onyango D.O. Naguleswaran A. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Angel S.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In TgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites, however, we found high levels of basal γH2AX and found that the increase in γH2AX is dependent on the KAT activity of TgMYST-B (Fig. 3B). The higher basal level of γH2AX is likely to be a contributing factor explaining why the TgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites are more resistant to MMS. We hypothesized that the increase in γH2AX may be due to inappropriately activated ATM kinase. In human cells, ATM kinase responds to genotoxic stresses that lead to double-stranded DNA breaks following activation by TIP60 (22Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Toxoplasma possesses a predicted ATM kinase (50.m03243/TGGT1_024330), and we examined ATM kinase protein levels by immunoblotting Toxoplasma lysate with a cross-reactive antibody. ATM kinase was only detectable in the fTgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites; we could not detect ATM kinase in wild type or parasites expressing mutant fTgMYST-B (Fig. 3C). To test if the increase in ATK kinase may be due to increased transcript levels, we analyzed ATM kinase mRNA levels in wild type versus parasites overexpressing fTgMYST-B or the mutant version fTgMYST-B(E403G). We detected increased levels of ATM kinase mRNA in fTgMYST-B-expressing parasites compared with wild type and transgenics expressing mutant fTgMYST-B (Fig. 4A). Actin was assayed as a control to show that gene expression is not globally up-regulated in the TgMYST-B-overexpressing clone. We then determined if fTgMYST-B was being recruited to the ATM kinase promoter, which would be consistent with the idea that TgMYST-B activates ATM kinase gene expression. Four regions spanning the predicted start codon of the ATM kinase locus were selected for analysis by ChIP. The results display the expected enrichment of fTgMYST-B in regions most proximal to the predicted start site for ATM kinase (Fig. 4B). Identical ChIP assays were performed on parasites expressing the mutated fTgMYST-B(E403G). fTgMYST-B(E403G) shows a similar localization pattern at the ATM kinase gene, indicating that KAT activity does not interfere with TgMYST-B recruitment to target genes. To ensure that fTgMYST-B is not being recruited to promoters randomly, we performed ChIP at the Toxoplasma actin promoter because actin mRNA is not increased in the fTgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the ATM kinase gene, the presence of fTgMYST-B does not significantly increase at genes like actin that are not up-regulated (Fig. 4B). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that the KAT activity of TgMYST-B protects cells from DNA damage by contributing to the activation of the ATM kinase gene. It was observed that the parasites expressing additional TgMYST-B were taking considerably longer to lyse their host cell monolayer than wild type parasites. Toxoplasma growth assays comparing wild type and fTgMYST-B-expressing parasites confirmed a significant decrease in parasite proliferation (Fig. 5A). Additional clones isolated from an independent transfection with fTgMYST-B also displayed the same retardation in growth (data not shown). The doubling time of wild type parasites is ∼8 h, but it increases to ∼16–18 h in the fTgMYST-B overexpressor (Fig. 5B). Toxoplasma expressing fTgMYST-B(E403G) grow at the same rate as wild type. The slowed growth is not a result of conversion to the bradyzoite stage as determined by Dolichos lectin staining and PCR for the bradyzoite-specific marker gene BAG1 (data not shown). We conclude that the acetyltransferase activity of TgMYST-B is important in properly regulating growth rate in Toxoplasma tachyzoites. To explore the possibility that inappropriately activated ATM kinase contributes to the slowed replication of the fTgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites, we added KU-55933, a well characterized ATM kinase inhibitor with an IC50 of 13.0 nm (23Lau A. Swinbank K.M. Ahmed P.S. Taylor D.L. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. O'Connor M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), to the cultures. As shown in Fig. 6A, inclusion of 10 nm KU-55933 restores the growth rate of fTgMYST-B-expressing parasites to wild type levels. Because we have established that excess KAT activity is responsible for the slowed growth of fTgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites (Fig. 5), we examined the effect of pharmacological inhibition of in vivo KAT activities. The addition of anacardic acids (24Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Price B.D. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4353-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) also restored the growth rate of fTgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites to levels similar to wild type (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that the mechanism of the reduced replication observed in TgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites involves inappropriate activation of Toxoplasma ATM kinase by TgMYST-B KAT. Here we report the full-length cloning and characterization of the second MYST family KAT in the parasite T. gondii, building from a partial clone first described by Smith et al. (8Smith A.T. Tucker-Samaras S.D. Fairlamb A.H. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 5′-RACE for TgMYST-B revealed an unusual 5′-UTR that harbors an intron, which has been reported for other genes in Apicomplexa (e.g. Plasmodium HGPRT (25Cappai R. Cowman A.F. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar)). Similar to TgMYST-A, TgMYST-B can be classified as a “MYST + CHD” KAT, which includes yeast Esa1, human TIP60, and human and Drosophila MOF (2Utley R.T. Côté J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 274: 203-236PubMed Google Scholar). Both TgMYST-A and -B are similar in size (between 50 and 60 kDa) and subcellular localization and bear the strongest homology to MYST family proteins found in plants. We present several lines of data suggesting that a subset of total TgMYST-B protein must gain access to the parasite nucleus. Although difficult to detect by IFA, immune electron microscopy shows that 20% of TgMYST-B localized to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 2D). TgMYST-B contains a basic-rich stretch of amino acids beginning at residue 125, which is characteristic of a nuclear localization signal (15Bhatti M.M. Sullivan Jr., W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5902-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Most convincingly, we are able to purify TgMYST-B associated with genomic DNA via ChIP (Fig. 4B). It is intriguing, however, that the bulk of protein is in the cytosol; similar results were observed for TgMYST-A (8Smith A.T. Tucker-Samaras S.D. Fairlamb A.H. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, we did not detect by IFA any shift in the localization pattern following alkaline pH stress or MMS treatment (data not shown). In other species, MYST KATs are largely nuclear, presumably operating primarily as histone acetyltransferases. However, human TIP60 has been shown to be translocate into the cytoplasm to form “speckles” that facilitate the stabilization of Nmi (N-Myc and STAT interactor) protein (26Zhang K. Zheng G. Yang Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 303: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In another example, an alternatively spliced form of TIP60 called TIP60β is present in both nuclear and cytosolic compartments (27Ran Q. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene. 2000; 258: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Toxoplasma is the first cell reported to have such high proportions of MYST KAT protein in the cytosol relative to the nucleus. We speculate two possible reasons for the unusual distribution of TgMYST KATs. First, the distribution may simply be for regulatory reasons to control the amount of TgMYST protein in the nucleus; however, a more tantalizing possibility is that the TgMYST KATs regulate non-histone proteins via acetylation. Several proteomic studies have recently revealed that acetylation is a widespread post-translational modification in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (28Kim S.C. Sprung R. Chen Y. Xu Y. Ball H. Pei J. Cheng T. Kho Y. Xiao H. Xiao L. Grishin N.V. White M. Yang X.J. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Sprung R. Pei J. Tan X. Kim S. Zhu H. Liu C.F. Grishin N.V. Zhao Y. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 215-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Yeast proteome microarray studies have shown that the nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4) complex, which contains MYST KAT Esa1, acetylates cytosolic substrates, such as Pck1 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) (30Lin Y.Y. Lu J.Y. Zhang J. Walter W. Dang W. Wan J. Tao S.C. Qian J. Zhao Y. Boeke J.D. Berger S.L. Zhu H. Cell. 2009; 136: 1073-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Previously, when we attempted to overexpress TgMYST-A in Toxoplasma, we could not do so unless the catalytic domain was mutated (8Smith A.T. Tucker-Samaras S.D. Fairlamb A.H. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we report that expression of additional TgMYST-B, but not a mutant form, dramatically slows the growth of transgenic tachyzoites. This result suggests that the KAT activity of TgMYST-B may be important in the regulation of cell cycle, which could be connected to the established role of MYST KATs in the DNA damage response (19Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). TgMYST-B overexpressors show increased protection against the alkylating agent MMS (Fig. 3A). The presence of ATM kinase explains the increased basal levels of γH2AX in the TgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites. In turn, increased γH2AX causes cell cycle arrest and a decrease in the number of cells in mitosis (31Rios-Doria J. Velkova A. Dapic V. Galán-Caridad J.M. Dapic V. Carvalho M.A. Melendez J. Monteiro A.N. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2009; 8: 422-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), thus explaining why parasites containing extra TgMYST-B exhibit retarded growth in culture. We postulated two mechanisms how TgMYST-B may increase the levels of ATM kinase. One mechanism has already been established in humans; TIP60 activates ATM kinase through direct acetylation of Lys3016 (3Sun Y. Xu Y. Roy K. Price B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8502-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 32Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Although Toxoplasma ATM kinase contains the conserved lysine residue (Lys1966), we could not test this possibility because the anti-ATM kinase antibodies do not immunoprecipitate the Toxoplasma ATM kinase. In this report, we present evidence for a novel second mechanism that involves TgMYST-B increasing ATM kinase mRNA levels. Further analysis showed that TgMYST-B is specifically recruited to the ATM kinase promoter and that this recruitment is independent of KAT activity. The recruitment of enzymatically active TgMYST-B to the ATM kinase gene correlates with an increase in ATM kinase mRNA levels; conversely, KAT-deficient TgMYST-B, despite being recruited to the ATM kinase gene, is unable to up-regulate mRNA levels. These data strongly suggest that TgMYST-B KAT activity is critical for ATM kinase-mediated DNA repair in Toxoplasma. Our study does not rule out other possibilities that could contribute to increase ATM kinase protein in the TgMYST-B-overexpressing parasites. For example, it is possible that KAT activity of TgMYST-B directly or indirectly leads to stabilization of ATM kinase protein. Toxoplasma is now the earliest eukaryote demonstrated to have a link between MYST KATs and the response to DNA injury. These findings also suggest that TgMYST-B is orthologous to mammalian TIP60, which is known to be critical for DNA damage response (19Squatrito M. Gorrini C. Amati B. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 433-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies are attempting to elucidate the TgMYST-B complex to determine the identity of the associating proteins. Toxoplasma causes congenital birth defects and life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients. More tolerable drug therapies are urgently needed because the current treatment of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine has toxic side effects. The data we present here, considered with our previous findings reported by Smith et al. (8Smith A.T. Tucker-Samaras S.D. Fairlamb A.H. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that MYST KATs are involved in diverse critical functions in the parasite, therefore underscoring this protein family as important candidates for future drug design.

https://openalex.org/W2096982442,"The earliest known biochemical step that occurs after ligand binding to the multichain immune recognition receptor is tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor subunits. In mast cells and basophils activated by multivalent antigen-IgE complexes, this step is mediated by Src family kinase Lyn, which phosphorylates the high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI). However, the exact molecular mechanism of this phosphorylation step is incompletely understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that changes in activity and/or topography of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) could play a major role in the FcϵRI triggering. We found that exposure of rat basophilic leukemia cells or mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells to PTP inhibitors, H2O2 or pervanadate, induced phosphorylation of the FcϵRI subunits, similarly as FcϵRI triggering. Interestingly, and in sharp contrast to antigen-induced activation, neither H2O2 nor pervanadate induced any changes in the association of FcϵRI with detergent-resistant membranes and in the topography of FcϵRI detectable by electron microscopy on isolated plasma membrane sheets. In cells stimulated with pervanadate, H2O2 or antigen, enhanced oxidation of active site cysteine of several PTPs was detected. Unexpectedly, most of oxidized phosphatases bound to the plasma membrane were associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Several PTPs (SHP-1, SHP-2, hematopoietic PTP, and PTP-MEG2) showed changes in their enzymatic activity and/or oxidation state during activation.

https://openalex.org/W2013385255,"The PIAS proteins (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) were originally identified as inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway. Subsequently, their roles on transcriptional regulation have been identified in modulation of the androgen receptor (AR) and other nuclear hormone receptor-mediated actions. Zimp7, also named Zmiz2, is a novel PIAS-like protein and functions as a transcriptional co-activator. In this study, we demonstrate an interaction between Zimp7 and PIAS proteins with higher preference for PIAS3. A modified mammalian one-hybrid assay showed that the NH(2)-terminal proline-rich domain of Zimp7 and the region spanning amino acids 321-486 of PIAS3 were the primary interaction segments. The interaction between Zimp7 and PIAS3 proteins was further confirmed by in vitro protein pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays with both exogenous and endogenous proteins. Expression of exogenous PIAS3 further enhances Zimp7-mediated augmentation of AR transcription. Knockdown of the endogenous PIAS3 protein using a specific PIAS3 small hairpin RNA reduced the augmentation of Zimp7 on AR-mediated transcription. Co-localization of Zimp7 and PIAS3 proteins was observed in the nuclei of cells by immunostaining. Exogenous PIAS3 expression enhances the stability of the Zimp7 protein. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that PIAS3 is involved in the AR- and Zimp7-formed protein complex(es) in the AR downstream target promoter to facilitate androgen-induced transcription. Finally, we further demonstrated that loss of Zimp7 significantly impaired PIAS3-mediated enhancement on AR activity in mouse Zimp7 null (zimp7(-/-)) embryonic fibroblasts. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel interaction between PIAS and PIAS-like proteins and elucidate a novel regulatory mechanism for PIAS proteins in AR-mediated transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2043915060,"There is a gap between the initial formation of cells carrying radiation-induced genetic damage and their contribution to cancer development. Herein, we reveal a previously uncharacterized gene FATS through a genome-wide approach and demonstrate its essential role in regulating the abundance of p21 in surveillance of genome integrity. A large exon coding the NH2-terminal domain of FATS, deleted in spontaneous mouse lymphomas, is much more frequently deleted in radiation-induced mouse lymphomas. Its human counterpart is a fragile site gene at a previously identified loss of heterozygosity site. FATS is essential for maintaining steady-state level of p21 protein and sustaining DNA damage checkpoint. Furthermore, the NH2-terminal FATS physically interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to enhance the acetylation of endogenous p21, leading to the stabilization of p21. Our results reveal a molecular linkage between p21 abundance and radiation-induced carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2095345114,"Sortilin acts as a cell surface receptor for pro-neurotrophins (pro-NT) that upon complex formation with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is able to signal neuronal cell death. Here we screened a sortilin peptide library comprising 16-mer overlapping sequences for binding of the pro-domains of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We find that a linear surface-exposed sequence, (163)RIFRSSDFAKNF(174), constitutes an important pro-NT binding epitope in sortilin. Systematic mutational analysis revealed residues Arg(163), Phe(165), Arg(166), and Phe(170) to be critical for the interaction. Expression of a sortilin mutant in which these four amino acids were substituted by alanines disrupted pro-NT binding without affecting receptor heterodimerization with p75(NTR) or binding of ligands that selectively engages the centrally located tunnel in the beta-propeller of sortilin. We furthermore demonstrate that a peptide comprising the ligand-binding epitope can prevent pro-NT-induced apoptosis in RN22 schwannoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067301577,"The intestinal epithelium is dynamic, with proliferation of undifferentiated crypt cells balanced by terminal differentiation and cell death at the colon surface or small intestinal villus tips. Cyclic AMP, induced by agonists such as prostaglandin E(2) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, promotes proliferation and ion secretion and suppresses apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells. Here, we show that cell differentiation in a model intestinal epithelium leads to attenuation of cAMP production in response to G protein-coupled receptor and receptor-independent agonists. Concomitantly, key components of the cAMP cascade, the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein, G(s), and adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms 3, 4, 6, and 7 are down-regulated. By contrast, AC1, AC2, AC8, and AC9, and the receptors for prostaglandin E(2) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, are not expressed or not affected by differentiation. We confirmed key findings in normal murine colon epithelium, in which the major AC isoforms and G(s)alpha are markedly down-regulated in differentiated surface cells. Suppression of AC isoforms and G(s)alpha is functionally important, because their constitutive expression completely reverses differentiation-induced cAMP attenuation. Thus, down-regulation of AC isoforms and G(s)alpha is an integral part of the intestinal epithelial differentiation program, perhaps serving to release cells from cAMP-promoted anti-apoptosis as a prerequisite for cell death upon terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2049943223,"c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein induction of genomic instability (GI) contributes to its initial transforming function and subsequent tumor cell evolution. We describe here a pathway by which Myc, via its target protein glycoprotein Ibalpha (GpIb alpha), mediates GI. Proteomic profiling revealed that the serine/threonine kinase Aurora B is down-regulated by GpIb alpha in p53-deficient primary human fibroblasts. The phenotypes of Aurora B deficiency are strikingly reminiscent of Myc or GpIb alpha overexpression and include double-stranded DNA breaks, altered nuclear size and morphology, chromatin bridges, cleavage furrow regression, and tetraploidy. During mitosis, GpIb alpha and Aurora B redistribute to the cleavage furrow along with other cleavage furrow proteins. GpIb alpha overexpression at levels comparable with those seen in some tumor cells causes the dispersal of these proteins but not Aurora B, resulting in furrow regression and cytokinesis failure. Aurora B normalization redirects the mislocalized furrow proteins to their proper location, corrects the cleavage furrow abnormalities, and restores genomic stability. Aurora B thus appears necessary for a previously unrecognized function in guiding and positioning a number of key proteins, including GpIb alpha to the cleavage furrow. These findings underscore the importance of maintaining a delicate balance among cleavage furrow-associated proteins during mitosis. Suppression of Aurora B via GpIb alpha provides a unifying and mechanistic explanation for several types of Myc-mediated GI."
https://openalex.org/W2035916334,"Protocadherin LKC (PLKC) is a member of the heterogeneous subgroup of protocadherins that was identified and described as a potential tumor-suppressor gene involved in contact inhibition (Okazaki, N., Takahashi, N., Kojima, S., Masuho, Y., and Koga, H. (2002) Carcinogenesis 23, 1139–1148 and Ose, R., Yanagawa, T., Ikeda, S., Ohara, O., and Koga, H. (2009) Mol. Oncol. 3, 54–66). Several aspects of the structure, posttranslational processing, targeting, and function of this new protocadherin are still not known. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of PLKC at the apical membrane domain and its concentration at regions of cell-cell contacts occur concomitantly with significant elevation of PLKC-mRNA levels. Furthermore, it can be found within the adherens junctions, but it does not colocalize with tight junctions proteins ZO-1 and occludin, respectively. Additionally, unlike E-cadherin, PLKC is not redistributed upon Ca2+ removal. Biosynthetic labeling revealed N- and O-glycosylation as posttranslational modifications as well as a fast transport to the cell surface and a low turnover rate. During differentiation, PLKC associates with detergent-resistant membranes that trigger its redistribution from intracellular membranes to the cell surface. This association occurs concomitant with alterations in the glycosylation pattern. We propose a role for PLKC in the establishment of a proper epithelial cell polarity that requires O-linked glycosylation and association of the protein with detergent-resistant membranes. Protocadherin LKC (PLKC) is a member of the heterogeneous subgroup of protocadherins that was identified and described as a potential tumor-suppressor gene involved in contact inhibition (Okazaki, N., Takahashi, N., Kojima, S., Masuho, Y., and Koga, H.

This association occurs concomitant with alterations in the glycosylation pattern. We propose a role for PLKC in the establishment of a proper epithelial cell polarity that requires O-linked glycosylation and association of the protein with detergent-resistant membranes. The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity is one of the most important issues in a variety of tissues within organisms from worms to humans. Achievement of tissue polarity is linked to a distinct state of differentiation of each cell within the monolayer. This differentiation occurs during cell proliferation and development and is facilitated by cell-cell contacts and extracellular stimulation via hormones, cytokines, or other signals. The molecular mechanisms underlying cell differentiation and formation of epithelial monolayers are highly conserved among animals (3Nelson W.J. Nature. 2003; 422: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). During cell development, particular proteins are targeted to the sites of cell-cell contacts to establish strong connections with neighboring cells and form a closed monolayer of cells that is capable of accomplishing barrier functions. In vertebrate cells several connective molecule families are known to form zones of cell-cell contacts. The expression of some of them is up-regulated (like several cadherins (4Kuzmenko Y.S. Kern F. Bochkov V.N. Tkachuk V.A. Resink T.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), and many proteins are redistributed to the sites of cell-cell contacts (like zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) 2The abbreviations used are: ZO-1zonula occludens protein 1BNGbenzyl-N-acetylgalactosamineDMMdeoxymannojirimycinendo Hendo-N-β-acetylglucosaminidase HERendoplasmic reticulumMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyPLKCprotocadherin liver, kidney, colonPLKChhigh mannose glycoformPLKCCcomplex glycosylated, mature formPNGase Fpeptide N-glycanase FYFP and GFPyellow and green fluorescent proteins, respectivelyDRMdetergent-resistant membranePBSphosphate-buffered saline.) during progression of differentiation (5Furuse M.

The cadherin superfamily has been long known to mediate Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion in a homophilic manner (6Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cadherins are involved in several pivotal cellular functions, such as recognition, signaling, and communication as well as morphogenesis and angiogenesis (7Gory-Fauré S. Prandini M.H. Pointu H.

Cell. 1999; 98: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Various cadherins mediate specific cell-cell adhesion and play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of tissues (10Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar), particularly by establishment of the adherent junction belt whereby they bridge proteins to the actin cytoskeleton (11Nelson W.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 12Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). A striking structural feature of cadherins is the unique extracellular fragment that consists of multiple domains, the cadherin repeats, each comprising around 100 highly conserved amino acid residues. Cadherins, such as E-cadherin, VE-, or N-cadherin exhibit five extracellular repeats and show a high similarity in their cytosolic domains (for review, see Ref. 13Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) which interact with β-catenins and small GTPases of the Rho family and interfere in receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling (11Nelson W.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Unlike cadherins, protocadherins form a heterogeneous cadherin subgroup with a varying range of extracellular cadherin repeats (15Morishita H. Yagi T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Sano K. Tanihara H. Heimark R.L. Obata S. Davidson M. St John T. Taketani S. Suzuki S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Well known protocadherins are those expressed in the nervous system (17Hirayama T. Yagi T. Curr. Opin.

However, protocadherins in other tissues have been also characterized, such as μ-protocadherin (19Goldberg M. Peshkovsky C. Shifteh A. Al-Awqati Q. J. Biol.

Development. 1998; 125: 3389-3397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may play a role in the development and function of the nervous system (17Hirayama T. Yagi T. Curr. Opin.

In contrast to cadherins, protocadherins reveal distinct structural features that vary in the number of repeats (e.g. 4 in μ-protocadherin to 34 in FAT-1) and in their cytoplasmic tails, suggesting different types of interactions with cellular components as well as functional diversity. A more recently described protocadherin is that expressed in the liver, kidney, and colon (PLKC) (1Okazaki N. Takahashi N. Kojima S. Masuho Y. Koga H. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ose R. Yanagawa T. Ikeda S. Ohara O. Koga H. Mol. Oncol. 2009; 3: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which was later renamed PCDH24 by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee. Characteristics of PLKC are seven extracellular cadherin repeats with 93–117 amino acids each and a 35-amino acid-long cytoplasmic domain that is terminated by a PDZ binding domain. An interaction with the PDZ domain of hMAST205 has been demonstrated, suggesting a possible role as a switch for intracellular signaling (1Okazaki N. Takahashi N. Kojima S. Masuho Y. Koga H. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the structural features of PLKC, its biosynthesis, intracellular processing, and sorting during differentiation. Streptomycin, penicillin, glutamine, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and trypsin were purchased from PAA Laboratories GmbH (Pasching, Austria). Pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, trypsin inhibitor, and molecular mass standards for SDS-PAGE were from Sigma. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. l-[35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), Alkophos direct labeling of DNA probes kit, Hybond N+ nylon membranes, and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Acrylamide, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine were purchased from Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany). SDS, ammonium persulfate, dithiothreitol, and Triton X-100 were obtained from Merck. The pEYFP-N1 vector was purchased from Clontech Laboratories Inc. (Heidelberg, Germany). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of PLKC-YFP were performed with anti-GFP antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). For immunofluorescence studies, anti-ZO-1 and anti-occludin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco) and anti-E-cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories) were used. Phalloidin-ALEXA Fluor 546 for actin staining and Alexa Fluor 568 anti mouse were purchased from Invitrogen. Commercial monoclonal antibody against flotillin-2 and RhoA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy® mini kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized by using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) with random hexamer nucleotide primers. PCR was performed on a Biometra Personal Cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) using the following primers: PLKC forward (5′-CAGCGGGCTCAGCCTCCGTTC-3′) and PLKC reverse (5′-CTGTCCAGGGGCCCCAGGTTTCTG-3′) or β-actin forward (5′-GGCATCGTGATGGACTCCG-3′) and β-actin reverse 5′-GCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGA-3′, respectively. Intensity of the DNA bands was assessed in a charged coupled device (CCD) camera and quantified using Quantity One 4.5.2 software (both are products of Bio-Rad). The maximum expression of PLKC in fully differentiated and polarized cells was set as 100%, and other samples were quantified accordingly. Northern blot analysis of RNA from subconfluent and confluent MDCK cells was performed on nylon membranes according to Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J. William D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled DNA probe corresponding to a fragment of the PLKC cDNA (1–1700 bp). The nylon membrane was exposed overnight to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The quantitative analysis of the labeling intensities of the RNA transcripts was further determined using Fluor S multiimager specific programs (Bio-Rad). To generate a YFP-tagged version of PLKC, an expression vector was generated using the following primers: PLKC forward (5′-GAATTCGATGGCCCAGCTATGGCTGTC-3′) and PLKC reverse (5′-CCGCGGTGACAGGTCCGTGGT-3′). The resulting expression vector pEYFP-PLKC contained enhanced YFP fused in-frame to the 3′ end of PLKC. MDCK-II cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were transfected with 5 μg of the appropriate recombinant DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cell lines were selected in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml active G418 (Invitrogen), and after 18–23 days, surviving colonies were isolated. Stable cells expressing PLKC-YFP were screened by immunoprecipitation and by fluorescence laser confocal microscopy. The generated clones were indicated MDCK-PLKC-YFP. For co-localization studies MDCK-PLKC-YFP cells were transiently transfected with Golgi-dsRed cDNA (Clontech) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated in methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium for 2 h before labeling in the same medium containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for the indicated time intervals. In pulse-chase experiments the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for the indicated times and chased with methionine-containing standard culture medium for different periods of time. Cell solubilization and immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged PLKC molecules were performed according to established procedures (27Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using anti-GFP antibodies. The immunoprecipitated proteins were further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The radioactive protein bands were visualized using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad. In some experiments N-linked deglycosylation of the precipitated proteins was performed with endoglycosidase H or endoglycosidase F/PNGase F (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blotting was performed using anti-GFP antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. The secondary antibody employed anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), and the protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal® ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection occurred by the ChemiDoc system together with the QuantityOne software (both from Bio-Rad) and x-ray (x-ray Retina XBA) film sheets (Fotochemische Werke GmbH Berlin, Germany). Association of PLKC with DRMs was investigated by a discontinuous sucrose-density gradient as reported previously (28Castelletti D. Alfalah M. Heine M. Hein Z. Schmitte R. Fracasso G. Colombatti M. Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In brief, cells at a subconfluent stage of differentiation (around 50% optical confluence) and 2 days after confluence were lysed with 1% (w/v) of Triton X-100 in PBS. After low speed centrifugation, each sample was diluted to a final sucrose concentration of 40% and laid onto an 80% sucrose cushion. Then 1 ml of sample was overlaid with 7 ml of 30% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose on the top and, finally, centrifuged for 18 h at 100,000 × g with a swing-out rotor. Nine fractions of 1 ml each were collected from the top and analyzed for the protein content by Western blotting. The distribution of the marker proteins flotillin-2 and RhoA was tested as the positive and negative control, respectively. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. For imaging of intracellular and surface-localized proteins, the cells were treated with 0.5% saponin in 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions in PBS (v/v): anti ZO-1 (1:100), anti-occludin (1:100), and anti-E-cadherin (1:50). The secondary antibodies employed Cy3 anti-rabbit (Sigma) and Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:1000. Confocal laser scanning microscopy of living or fixed cells was performed in a Leica TCS SP2 microscope with a 63× water planapochromat lens (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). Dual color YFP and Cy3 or Alexa Fluor images were obtained by sequential scans with the 468-nm excitation line of an argon laser or the 543-nm excitation line of a He/Ne laser, respectively, and the optimal emission wave length for GFP or Cy3/Alexa. Stably transfected MDCK cells were labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 8 h, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with 100 μg trypsin/ml in PBS on ice for 45 min. After quenching excess trypsin with 200 μg of soybean trypsin, inhibitor cells were processed for immunoprecipitation as described above. To test the role of glycosylation on the sorting of PLKC, inhibitors of glycosylation processing were added to the growth medium during 24 h of cell culture. Benzyl-GalNAc (4 mm) was used as an inhibitor of O-glycosylation and deoxymannojirimycin (DMM) (5 mm) was utilized to interfere with processing of N-glycosylated PLKC. For cholesterol depletion, methyl-β-cyclodextrin was used at 50 mm final concentration. All inhibitors were obtained from Sigma. The subcellular distribution and intracellular processing of PLKC were analyzed using PLKC fused at its C-terminal end to YFP. This chimeric protein was stably expressed in MDCK-II cells, which are denoted thereafter as MDCK-PLKC-YFP. We used this cell line rather than wild type MDCK cells to investigate the structure and function of PLKC for two main reasons. First, the limited access to anti-PLKC antibodies hampered these analyses, whereas the recombinant PLKC-YFP protein could be analyzed using commercially available anti-GFP antibodies that recognize the YFP variant of GFP. Second, wild type endogenous PLKC showed a similar cellular distribution as PLKC-YFP as assessed by anti-PLKC antibodies (1Okazaki N. Takahashi N. Kojima S. Masuho Y. Koga H. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first analyzed the cellular localization of PLKC-YFP in differentiating MDCK cells. Fig. 1 reveals a striking alteration in the protein distribution pattern of PLKC at the plasma membrane. In single MDCK-II cells (Fig. 1A, single) PLKC accumulates intracellularly, mainly in the Golgi apparatus (white arrow) as confirmed by colocalization of PLKC-YFP with a Golgi-dsRed marker that was transiently co-expressed in these cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, PLKC-YFP appears also in single cells as filamentous structures at the cell surface (blue arrow). Readily upon first contacts with neighboring cells, PLKC protein molecules are sorted toward the cell-cell contact sites (Fig. 1A, islands). Finally in a fully differentiated monolayer at 5 days postconfluence, nearly the entire protein is directed to the cell-cell contacts or localizes at the apical membrane (Fig. 1A, confluent), whereas the basal cell surface is totally devoid of PLKC (data not shown). Remarkably, all the cells examined exhibited high expression levels of PLKC molecules in cell membrane protrusions, particularly in cell-cell contact areas. Concomitant with differentiation, the expression of PLKC mRNA increases substantially as assessed by semiquantitative PCR (Fig. 1C). In fact, the mRNA levels increase steadily and strikingly when comparing cells revealing random membrane and intracellular distribution of PLKC (left two lanes, single and islands) with their fully differentiated epithelial counterparts (right two lanes, confluent and postconfluent). Additionally, RNA from polarized, differentiated (confluent), and non-polarized (20% confluent) MDCK cells were analyzed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1D). The quantitative analysis of the labeling intensities in both polar and non-polar cells was evaluated relative to the labeling intensities of the ribosomal RNA before blotting, and the results revealed an almost 7-fold higher expression of the PLKC gene in polarized MDCK cells compared with the non-polarized ones. We next examined the subcellular distribution of PLKC at the cell-cell contact regions of the lateral side in epithelial cells. PLKC colocalizes with E-cadherin at sites of lateral cell-cell contacts (Fig. 2, A and B), but not with ZO-1 and occludin (Fig. 2, C and D), two protein markers of the zonula occludens belt complex in polarized epithelial monolayers (5Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 29Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Both tight junction proteins are expressed in limited regions at the most apical cell-cell contacts (blue arrow), but their localization is clearly distinct from spots of PLKC, which never colocalized with ZO-1 or occludin. Interestingly, the strongest PLKC expression was found at the apical membrane (white arrow). Calcium concentration plays a crucial role in establishment and maintenance of epithelial monolayers. In fact, chelation of extracellular calcium ions disrupts the adherens junctions with subsequent dramatic alteration in the distribution of E-cadherin and other cadherins as well as cell detachment (30Volberg T. Geiger B. Kartenbeck J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31Takeda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We investigated, therefore, the impact of extracellular calcium on the subcellular distribution and cell surface expression of PLKC by calcium depletion in a time-course experiment utilizing the calcium specific chelating reagent EGTA. The positive control employed E-cadherin that is normally affected by calcium. Fig. 3A shows that the addition of EGTA to MDCK-PLKC-YFP cells did not affect the cell surface localization of PLKC, whereas a substantial redistribution of E-cadherin from the cell membrane to submembranous and vesicular structures occurred (compare Fig. 3A (+ EGTA) with Fig. 2A (− EGTA)). No change in the distribution patterns of these two proteins was observed with increasing time until cell detachment occurred after ∼45 min. Here, nearly all E-cadherin molecules accumulated in the cell body, whereas PLKC persisted at the plasma membrane regardless of calcium removal. Interestingly, after 30 min most cells lost their intercellular contacts and adopted a rounded shape but maintained their adherence to the plates via a filamentous network in basal cell protrusions that exhibited a high expression of PLKC-YFP (Fig. 3B). The effect of calcium depletion was reversible. We next investigated the biosynthesis and processing of PLKC in differentiated MDCK-PLKC-YFP as well as its delivery to the cell surface. Fig. 4, A and B, shows that the earliest detectable biosynthetic form of PLKC-YFP is the ER-resident, endo H-sensitive 170-kDa mannose-rich polypeptide (PLKCh) that shifts to 145 kDa after endo H treatment. Further processing in the Golgi apparatus generates the endo H-resistant complex-glycosylated 210-kDa mature form of PLKC (PLKCC), which shifts upon N-deglycosylation with PNGase F generating a 160-kDa protein (Fig. 4A, third lane). Similar to endo H treatment, PNGase F shifted the mannose-rich polypeptide also to a 145-kDa protein. The difference between the two PNGase products could, therefore, be attributed to the presence of O-glycans on PLKC. Another issue we addressed was the rate of maturation and trafficking of PLKC using pulse-chase experiments. Endo H was used to distinguish between early ER mannose-rich and mature processed complex-glycosylated forms of PLKC. Fig. 4B shows that PLKC is transported from the ER to the Golgi at a rapid rate as assessed by the appearance of endo H-resistant PLKC forms already after 15 min of chase. The trafficking of mature PLKC to the cell surface was probed by treatment of intact cells with trypsin. Trypsin was demonstrated in preliminary experiments to cleave PLKC and is, therefore, expected to cleave cell surface exposed PLKC molecules (not shown). As shown in Fig. 4C this treatment generated a cleaved form of PLKC already at 30 min of chase after complex glycosylation of PLKC in the Golgi occurred. The intensity of the truncated PLKC form increased at 1 h of chase with a concomitant decrease in that of uncleaved PLKCC; the intracellular mannose-rich form PLKCh remained unaffected. This result points to a precursor-product relationship between PLKCC and the cleaved form and indicates that PLKCC is exposed at the cell surface. The data further support the notion that PLKC transport to the cell surface occurs rapidly and at almost similar rates to its transport between the ER and the Golgi. In fact, truncated surface-exposed PLKCC (30 min of chase) occurs 15 min after complex glycosylation, which in turn also occurs after 15 min of chase. Moreover, PLKC has a very slow turnover rate (Fig. 4D). The altered cellular localization of PLKC from intracellular compartments in non-polarized cells to sites of cell-cell contacts and to the apical membrane raises questions regarding potential mechanisms implicated in this redistribution. This is particularly interesting in light of the unique and predominant localization of this protocadherin at the apical membrane. One potential sorting mechanism in epithelial cells implicates the association of proteins with specialized membrane microdomains that are resistant to solubilization in the cold with non-ionic detergents (for review, see Refs. 32Schuck S. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5955-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar and 33Lindner R. Naim H.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 2871-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These microdomains, also referred to as DRMs or lipid rafts, are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids when Triton X-100 is used as the discriminating detergent. We, therefore, asked whether PLKC associates with DRMs along the secretory pathway with particular emphasis on the temporal requirements of this association. Triton X-100 cell extracts of MDCK-PLKC-YFP at subconfluent stage of differentiation and 2 days postconfluence were subjected to sucrose gradients, and the presence of PLKC was examined in the floating fractions. Fig. 5 shows that PLKC was entirely recovered from the Triton X-100-soluble fractions in subconfluent MDCK cells (Fig. 5A). By contrast, analysis of confluent MDCK-PLKC-YFP cells, in which PLKC was exclusively expressed at the cell surface, revealed a shift in the pattern of PLKC toward the Triton X-100-insoluble floating fractions (Fig. 5B). The distribution pattern for flotillin, a protein that is often used as a marker of DRMs, differed from that of PLKC. Here, flotillin bands were detected in the floating fractions of the lysates of subconfluent as well as confluent cells. RhoA, a marker of proteins that are not associated with DRMs, was recovered in the soluble fractions regardless of cell confluency. The differing band pattern of PLKC in the floating fractions as compared with that in the soluble fractions suggests at first glance qualitative differences between the two forms concomitant with different subpopulations of PLKC in the floating and soluble fractions. The finding that PLKC redistributes from intracellular sites to the cell surface, particularly to the apical membrane, concomitant with its association with DRMs, is indicative of an essential role of these microdomains in the trafficking and cell surface delivery of PLKC during cellular differentiation. It has been previously shown that a potential sorting mechanism of membrane glycoproteins to the apical membrane utilizes O-glycans as a sorting signal in association with DRMs (34Alfalah M. Jacob R.

We, therefore, tested if the glycosylation of PLKC is altered in differentiated and undifferentiated MDCK-PLKC-YFP. Fig. 6A shows a Western blot analysis of PLKC in total cell lysates extracted from subconfluent and 2 days confluent cells. Although a difference in the size of PLKC in the subconfluent and confluent and fully differentiated cells is not clearly seen, treatment with PNGase F reveals a slight, but definite increase in the digested form of PLKC in differentiated cells in comparison to the subconfluent cells. Because PNGase F digests N-linked but not O-linked glycans, we propose that the elevated size of PLKC in differentiated cells is due to an increased content of O-glycans in these cells. To assess the role of O-glycosylation in the association of PLKC with DRMs, we utilized benzyl-N-acetylgalactosamine (BNG) that interferes and inhibits O-glycosylation. First, we examined the inhibitory capacity of BNG on the O-glycosylation of PLKC by comparing the electrophoretic mobilities of PLKC before and after treatment with BNG. Fig. 6B shows that BNG has reduced the size of PLKC, supporting the notion that PLKC and PNGase F digestion generates a smaller protein product from this glycoform as compared with PLKC from BNG-non-treated cells. These results support the notion that the O-glycosylation of PLKC has been inhibited or substantially affected in the presence of BNG. We next investigated the relevance of O-glycosylation to the association of PLKC with DRMs by assessment of the presence of BNG-affected PLKC in the floating fractions of Triton X-100 cell extracts of BNG-treated cells. Fig. 6C reveals that PLKC was not detected in the floating fraction, whereas the DRM marker flotillin was clearly found in these fractions. Therefore, O-glycosylation is necessary for the association of PLKC with DRMs, and an alteration in the content of O-glycosylation, for instance during cellular differentiation, redistributes PLKC from the Triton X-100-insoluble DRMs to the soluble fractions. On the other hand, inhibition of N-glycosylation by DMM did not exclude PLKC completely from detergent-resistant membranes (Fig. 6D). To further investigate the role of O-glycosylation in the trafficking of PLKC, we examined its localization on the cell surface in the presence of BNG, i.e. after inhibition of O-glycosylation. Fig. 7 shows that PLKC is distributed on both sides of the membrane in the presence of BNG, supporting the view that O-glycosylation is implicated in polarized trafficking of PLKC. DMM, by contrast, did not alter the subcellular localization of PLKC in comparison to untreated control. As shown above, PLKC associates with DRMs during cellular differentiation. We examined whether DRMs are required for PLKC-polarized trafficking and treated MDCK-PLKC-YFP cells with cyclodextrin, an inhibitor of cholesterol. Confocal images in Fig. 7 reveal a dramatic change in the pattern of PLKC and a shift to non-polarized cellular distribution. The subcellular localization of PLKC depends strongly on the differentiation state of epithelial cells as it redistributes from a predominant intracellular localization in non-polarized cells to sites of cell-cell contacts during polarization. In addition to this localization, a substantial proportion of PLKC is also located at the apical domain of polarized MDCK cells, rendering PLKC unique among other cadherins (39Shore E.M. Nelson W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19672-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Smith S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The apical localization is presumably mediated by a putative PDZ binding domain that is present in the cytosolic tail of PLKC. Importantly, the subcellular distribution of PLKC is linked to its association with DRMs during differentiation of MDCK and acquisition of polarized morphology. Thus, in non-confluent or subconfluent cells PLKC accumulates mostly intracellularly and is not associated with DRMs. On the other hand, a major proportion of the protein becomes associated with DRMs and is trafficked to the apical membrane when the cells acquire a polarized morphology. Our data strongly suggest that the putative mechanism responsible for this altered mode of association depends on the pattern of O-glycosylation of PLKC during differentiation. In fact, O-glycosylation of PLKC slightly increases during differentiation of MDCK cells, and inhibition of this type of glycosylation with BNG results in a complete redistribution of PLKC from DRMs to the Triton X-100-soluble fractions. It is, therefore, likely that O-glycans could act as a target signal that interacts with a potential sorting receptor with subsequent recruitment of PLKC to DRMs. It has been previously shown that a potential sorting mechanism of membrane glycoproteins to the apical membrane utilizes O-glycans as a sorting signal in association with DRMs (34Alfalah M.

The molecular basis of this putative sorting mechanism is still unresolved. Nevertheless, the discrimination between PLKC molecules in MDCK cells based on their association with DRMs and elevated O-glycans provides an invaluable and promising model system that could be utilized to address this mechanism at the molecular level. Another feature of PLKC that is presumably linked to its association with DRMs is its persistence at the cell surface upon depletion of extracellular calcium and subsequent disruption of cell-cell contacts. This feature clearly distinguishes PLKC from cadherins, which are usually redistributed to submembranous compartments under similar conditions (41Leve F. de Souza W. Morgado-Díaz J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 327: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cadherins are predominantly localized at the sites of cell-cell contacts and are not associated with DRMs. It is tempting to speculate that PLKC clustered into DRMs does not require calcium ions for its stability and retains its cellular localization independent of calcium. The data presented here unequivocally demonstrate that the expression of PLKC at the mRNA level is significantly up-regulated when cell-cell contacts occur and reaches its maximum in polarized monolayers several days after confluence. Finally, DRMs have been shown to serve as platforms for signaling pathways, and it is possible that DRMs-associated PLKC may trigger downstream signaling cascades that ultimately regulate essential components of the tight junctions, such as claudins and occludins. Pece and Gutkind (42Pece S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41227-41233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) report that E-cadherin is capable of inducing mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway signaling by a ligand-independent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. A correlation between overexpression of E-cadherin and its tight junction barrier function has not been yet established. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that even the permeability of renal cortical ducts can be modulated by different expression levels of cell-adhesion molecules, not only tight junction proteins, but also members of the cadherin family. Because more evidence is provided that the latter are capable of mediating intracellular signaling pathways, a dynamic and rapid regulation of the tightness of the intercellular barrier upon extracellular signal activation can be proposed. One step further is the assumption that PLKC might serve as a potential receptor by virtue of its localization at the apical membrane and, thus, its exposure to intraluminal signals. Altogether, we conclude that PLKC modulates cell polarity and structural properties of epithelial cells presumably upon induction of adhesive cell-cell contacts. This modulation depends on the interaction of PLKC with DRMs that occurs during cellular differentiation in MDCK cells. We thank Gabi Wetzel and Jürgen Eikemeyer for expert technical assistance."
