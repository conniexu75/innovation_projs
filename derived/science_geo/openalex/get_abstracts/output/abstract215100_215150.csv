The C-C, C-H, and O-H bond lengths deviate only slightly from their means of 1.523 A, 1.098 A, and 0.968 A. The C(1)-O(1) bond length, 1.389 A, is significantly shorter than the mean value, 1.420 A, of the other C-O bonds. The valence angle of the ring oxygen is 113.8 degrees."

https://openalex.org/W33319695,"The conversion of malonyl coenzyme A to long chain fatty acids has been studied in enzyme systems from various tissues (l-7). Attempts to purify the enzymes involved in this conversion revealed an important difference between these systems. Thus the highly purified synthetase from yeast (8, 9) and from liver (10, 11) behaves as a single complex; its fractionation has not yet been accomplished. However, extracts of Clostridium kluyveri and Escherichia coli can be resolved into several components which on combination catalyze the synthesis of fatty acids (7, 12-16). One of these components has the rather unusual property of being relatively stable to heat and dilute hydrochloric acid (7, 12, 13). Acetyl and malonyl moieties can be transferred from their coenzyme A derivatives to this protein. The acyl complexes are then condensed by suitable enzymes to form acetoacetyl-enzyme, which is subsequently converted to butyryl-enzyme (15-19). These findings support the scheme proposed earlier for the synthetase from yeast (8) .I Extracts from avocado mesocarp contain, in addition to the previously studied particulate system (5,20), a soluble enzymatic system, which converts malonyl coenzyme A to saturated long chain fat’ty acids (21). This soluble enzyme has as one of its components a heat-stable protein and therefore resembles the bacterial systems. Some of the data discussed here have already been reported elsewhere (22)."

https://openalex.org/W1995016030,"Semiotics and ethology have converged in a new behavioral science, zoosemiotics. Those who are interested in the theoretical analysis of the complex problems of non-verbal behavior that arise where these two disciplines interact aim to treat comprehensively animal communication systems by the aid of representations that have proved illuminating in the study of sentences of human language. Students of zoosemiotics are concerned with codes and messages much as linguists are concerned with competence, or language, and performance, or speech. They thus face the twin tasks of constructing a model for the addresser to specify how a message is encoded and transformed into a signal carried by a variety of channels to the addressee; and of constructing a model for the addressee to specify the ways in which animals utilize their knowledge of their code to recognize the messages they receive. Finally, they assess the context of the communicative event in the hope of dissecting that which is relevant to the selection process from the rest of the background, a program for which there is as yet neither a procedural eliciting technique nor a satisfactory theoretical solution in sight."

This procedure is designed to avoid physical and chemical alteration by strong alkali, acid, or high temperature and distortion of the molecular weight spectrum resulting from selective losses during sedimentation.

In ten of these patients a search for vallate papillae was made, but none were found. Inspection of the tongue may thus be useful for diagnosing this rare disease, even in infants. Absence of these sensory receptors suggests that the multiple sensory deficits found in persons with familial dysautonomia may be related to defects in the peripheral receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2089941384,"Eleven molecular forms and 34 phenotypes of transferrin have been detected in 372 serums from six macaque species. The tendency to polymorphism varies from species to species and from one local population to another. The most extensive polymorphism was observed in Macaca mulatta, which showed at least ten transferrins and 24 phenotypes. Transferrins present in stump-tail macaques (M. speciosa) from Thailand were also found in crab-eating macaques (M. irus) from Thailand, but not in crab-eating macaques from the Philippines. The results suggest that macaque species are semispecies rather than complete species."

Application of vibration to the opposite wrist also reduced intensity. The results may be attributed to physiological activities occurring at the early stages of information transmission.

Each pad is an integral part of a tylotrich follicle, a skin appendage that is highly specialized for sensory function."

However, the difference between the f values at any two positions is given directly by the data, and we have therefore based all calculations on values of f - ja, where f0 is the fringe height at the upper meniscus (r = r,). Where C, is the concen- tration at that position, f - fa = K(C - Co) (2)"

https://openalex.org/W1997843017,The X chromosome in Melanoplus differentialis is negatively heteropycnotic in the early spermatogonial cell generations but positively heteropycnotic in the final premeiotic interphase. Autoradiography after administration of tritiated thymidine reveals that this condensation change is paralleled by a change in the time of DNA replication in the X chromosome relative to that in the autosomes.

By illuminating columns in sequence, the pattern was made to appear to rotate. All of the animals tested circled in the direction of apparent movement. As with humans, movement was only perceived at intermediate rates of flashing."

https://openalex.org/W2009749397,"This study has demonstrated that type A botulinum toxin has a depressant effect on the cortical electrical activity of anesthetized and unanesthetized monkeys. Simultaneous recordings of vital signs indicated a relative lack of change in the electrocardiogram, respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate during this time. The change in the electroencephalogram appeared cyclic in nature and independent of dose or time. All animals exhibited signs of respiratory failure characterized by a gradual interference with neuromuscular transmission at the diaphragm, and subsequently died an anoxic death."
https://openalex.org/W2001540923,"The incorporation of uracil-C14 into macromolecules in Escherichia coli cells is decreased by doses of ionizing radiation when the cells are in very dilute suspension. The decrease results from an action of irradiated medium on the cells, and a similar reaction is observed during the incorporation of thymine (indication of DNA synthesis) and of proline and valine (indicative of protein synthesis). Irradiated medium reduces the formation of β-galactosidase but does not cause the degradation of DNA."
