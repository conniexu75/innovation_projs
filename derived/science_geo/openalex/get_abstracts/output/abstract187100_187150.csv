We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of Ultimatum Game players to investigate neural substrates of cognitive and emotional processes involved in economic decision-making. In this game, two players split a sum of money;one player proposes a division and the other can accept or reject this. We scanned players as they responded to fair and unfair proposals. Unfair offers elicited activity in brain areas related to both emotion (anterior insula) and cognition (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Further, significantly heightened activity in anterior insula for rejected unfair offers suggests an important role for emotions in decision-making."

Between 10.3 and 8 ky B.P., decadal to centennial variations in monsoon precipitation are in phase with temperature fluctuations recorded in Greenland ice cores, indicating that early Holocene monsoon intensity is largely controlled by glacial boundary conditions. After approximately 8 ky B.P., monsoon precipitation decreases gradually in response to changing Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation, with decadal to multidecadal variations in monsoon precipitation being linked to solar activity."

In this study, 903 murine leukemia virus (MLV) and 379 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrations in the human genome were mapped. The data showed that MLV preferred integration near the start of transcriptional units (either upstream or downstream) whereas HIV-1 preferred integration anywhere in the transcriptional unit but not upstream of the transcriptional start. Defining different integration site preferences for retroviruses will have important ramifications for gene therapy and may aid in our understanding of the factors directing the integration process."
https://openalex.org/W1649401714,"Carbon capture and storage (or sequestration) is receiving increasing attention as one tool for reducing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. In his Perspective,
 Lackner
 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different methods of carbon sequestration. He advises against sequestration in environmentally active carbon pools such as the oceans, because it may merely trade one environmental problem for another. Better sequestration options include underground injection and (possibly underground) neutralization. Taking into account carbon capture, transport, and storage, the author concludes that in the short and medium term, sequestration would almost certainly be cheaper than a full transition to nuclear, wind, or solar energy."
https://openalex.org/W2104216356,"Most cultivated and characterized eukaryotes can be confidently assigned to one of eight major groups. After a few false starts, we are beginning to resolve relationships among these major groups as well. However, recent developments are radically revising this picture again, particularly (i)the discovery of the likely antiquity and taxonomic diversity of ultrasmall eukaryotes, and (ii)a fundamental rethinking of the position of the root. Together these data suggest major gaps in our understanding simply of what eukaryotes are or, when it comes to the tree, even which end is up."
https://openalex.org/W2078176020,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor that mediates the antidiabetic effects of thiazolidinediones. PPARγ is present in adipose tissue and becomes elevated in fatty livers, but the roles of specific tissues in thiazolidinedione actions are unclear. We studied the function of liver PPARγ in both lipoatrophic A-ZIP/F-1 (AZIP) and wild type mice. In AZIP mice, ablation of liver PPARγ reduced the hepatic steatosis but worsened the hyperlipidemia, triglyceride clearance, and muscle insulin resistance. Inactivation of AZIP liver PPARγ also abolished the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of rosiglitazone, demonstrating that, in the absence of adipose tissue, the liver is a primary and major site of thiazolidinedione action. In contrast, rosiglitazone remained effective in non-lipoatrophic mice lacking liver PPARγ, suggesting that adipose tissue is the major site of thiazolidinedione action in typical mice with adipose tissue. Interestingly, mice without liver PPARγ, but with adipose tissue, developed relative fat intolerance, increased adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Thus, liver PPARγ regulates triglyceride homeostasis, contributing to hepatic steatosis, but protecting other tissues from triglyceride accumulation and insulin resistance."

Proteins of known structure can be matched to about 50% of genome sequences, and these data provide a quantitative description and can suggest hypotheses about the origins of these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2144983282,"In eukaryotes, the combinatorial association of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins is essential for transcription. We have used protein arrays to test 49 2 pairings of a nearly complete set of coiled-coil strands from human basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. We find considerable partnering selectivity despite the bZIPs' homologous sequences. The interaction data are of high quality, as assessed by their reproducibility, reciprocity, and agreement with previous observations. Biophysical studies in solution support the relative binding strengths observed with the arrays. New associations provide insights into the circadian clock and the unfolded protein response."
https://openalex.org/W2039992465,"Obesity, i.e. an excess of white adipose tissue (WAT), predisposes to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Brown adipose tissue is present in rodents but not in adult humans. It expresses uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) that allows dissipation of energy as heat. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) activate mouse UCP1 gene transcription. We show here that human PGC-1α induced the activation of the human UCP1 promoter by PPARγ. Adenovirus-mediated expression of human PGC-1α increased the expression of UCP1, respiratory chain proteins, and fatty acid oxidation enzymes in human subcutaneous white adipocytes. Changes in the expression of other genes were also consistent with brown adipocyte mRNA expression profile. PGC-1α increased the palmitate oxidation rate by fat cells. Human white adipocytes can therefore acquire typical features of brown fat cells. The PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone potentiated the effect of PGC-1α on UCP1 expression and fatty acid oxidation. Hence, PGC-1α is able to direct human WAT PPARγ toward a transcriptional program linked to energy dissipation. However, the response of typical white adipocyte targets to rosiglitazone treatment was not altered by PGC-1α. UCP1 mRNA induction was shown in vivo by injection of the PGC-1α adenovirus in mouse white fat. Alteration of energy balance through an increased utilization of fat in WAT may be a conceivable strategy for the treatment of obesity.

Alteration of energy balance through an increased utilization of fat in WAT may be a conceivable strategy for the treatment of obesity. Two types of adipose tissues coexist in mammals. White adipose tissue (WAT) 1The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; GFP, green fluorescent protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PGC, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RA, retinoic acid; RXR, retinoic acid X receptor; TZD, thiazolidinedione; UCP, uncoupling protein; MCAD, medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; GFP, green fluorescent protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PGC, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RA, retinoic acid; RXR, retinoic acid X receptor; TZD, thiazolidinedione; UCP, uncoupling protein; MCAD, medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase. has an essential role for storage of energy in the form of triacylglycerol. In situations of energy deficit such as fasting, lipolysis in WAT controls the supply of energy to the body through the release of fatty acids into the plasma. The uncontrolled expansion of WAT seen in obesity predisposes to the development of an array of metabolic disturbances leading to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Although it shares many features with WAT, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized in adaptive thermogenesis (1Himms-Hagen J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Differences in gene expression between WAT and BAT, most notably at the mitochondrial level, explain the thermogenic capacity of BAT. Fatty acid oxidation enzymes and respiratory chain components are highly expressed in BAT contributing to a high oxidative capacity. The activity of ATP synthase is low because of a defect in expression of the P1 gene (2Houstek J. Andersson U. Tvrdík P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7689-7694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the most distinguishing feature of BAT is the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (3Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). UCP1 is a 32-kDa protein expressed in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. UCP1 allows the dissipation of the proton electrochemical gradient generated by the respiratory chain. Uncoupling between oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis promotes energy dissipation as heat. The mechanism of action of UCP1 is still controversial. One model depicts UCP1 as a true proton transporter, whereas another model states that UCP1 catalyzes a fatty acid protonophoretic cycle (4Garlid K.D. Jaburek M. Jezek P. Varecha M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Fatty acids and retinoids have been shown to activate UCP1 (5Kligenberg M. Huang S.-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6Rial E. González-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. JiménezJiménez J. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In neonatal mammals, hibernators and rodents, cold-induced thermogenesis in BAT contributes to the maintenance of body temperature. Fuel is provided as fatty acids derived from BAT and WAT lipolysis. In rodents, BAT also participates in diet-induced thermogenesis and may thereby control the energy efficiency of food (7Rothwell N.J. Stock M.J. Obesity Res. 1997; 5: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). UCP1 biosynthesis is mainly controlled at the transcriptional level. During cold exposure, sympathetic nervous system stimulation of BAT is the primary signal that activates UCP1 gene expression. Retinoic acid (RA) and thyroid hormones are other positive regulators. A critical enhancer has been characterized in rodent UCP1 genes (8Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Gelly C. Fox N. Schrementi J. Raimbault S. Klaus S. Forest C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 9Kozak U.C. Kopecky J. Teisinger J. Enerbäck S. Boyer B. Kozak L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This region is required for catecholamine and RA stimulation. The enhancer contains a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) responsive element that mediates the stimulation induced by thiazolidinediones (TZD) (10Sears I.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Kovacs L.G. Graves R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3410-3419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cooperation with PPARγ, the PPARγ coactivator PGC-1α, has been shown to induce mouse UCP1 gene transcription (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). It also stimulates the expression of electron transport chain genes and mitochondrial biogenesis, through induction of nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (12Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). PGC-1α expression is increased in response to cold exposure and β-adrenergic stimulation (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). BAT is present throughout the life in rodents but disappears soon after birth in large mammals. In human fetus and newborn children, it is found in the cervical, axillary, perirenal, and periadrenal depots (13Lean M.E.J. James W.P.T. Trayhurn P. Nicholls D.G. Brown Adipose Tissue. Edward Arnold, London1986: 339-365Google Scholar). There are no BAT depots in adults, and UCP1 mRNA is expressed at very low levels in WAT (14Oberkofler H. Dallinger G. Liu Y.M. Hell E. Krempler F. Patsch W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2125-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BAT is not thought to contribute to a significant part of thermogenesis (15Astrup A. Bulow J. Madsen J. Christensen N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E507-E515PubMed Google Scholar). However, UCP1 is expressed in hibernomas and in perirenal WAT of adult patients with phaeochromocytoma and primary aldosteronism revealing that UCP1 expression can be induced in rare tumors and endocrinological disorders (16Garruti G. Ricquier D. Int. J. Obes. 1992; 16: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zancanaro C. Pelosi G. Accordini C. Balercia G. Sbabo L. Cinti S. Biol. Cell. 1994; 80: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Pharmacotherapy targeted at molecular pathways that regulate adaptive thermogenesis provides a plausible and safe means of increasing energy expenditure (18Crowley V.E. Yeo G.S. O'Rahilly S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Reactivation of brown adipocytes is therefore an important goal. Studies on human white adipocytes are mandatory to substantiate the proof of concept. In an attempt to promote a metabolic shift in white fat cells from lipid storage toward fatty acid utilization, human subcutaneous white adipocytes were transduced with an adenovirus expressing PGC-1α. The cells acquire features of brown adipocytes, i.e. an induction of UCP1 and respiratory chain gene expression, and an increased capacity to oxidize fatty acid. Conversion of white into brown adipocytes may therefore constitute a strategy to regulate fat mass in humans. Adenoviral Expression System and Adenofection Experiment in CV-1 Cells—Recombinant adenovirus was generated as described (19He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). The full-length human PGC-1α cDNA (20Larrouy D. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pAdEasy parent plasmid. Recombination between the pAdEasy and pAdTrack vectors and production of the PGC-1α adenovirus was performed at the Laboratoire de Thérapie Génique de Nantes. The virus contains, in tandem, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and the PGC-1α cDNA downstream of separate cytomegalovirus promoters. An adenovirus containing only the GFP gene was used as control. Viral titers were, respectively, 1.7 × 1011 and 1.4 × 1011 infectious particles per ml. Adenofection experiments were performed in CV-1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). The 6.3-kb UCP1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene construct (21Del Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.-C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cotransfected with expression vectors for PPARγ2 (from Bruce Spiegelman, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and retinoic acid X receptor α (RXRα) (from Pierre Chambon, IGBMC, Strasbourg, France) and a cytomegalovirus promoter-β-galactosidase gene vector to check for transfection efficiency. The PGC-1α or the GFP adenoviruses were added to the LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) transfection mixture at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 200. Cells were exposed for 6 h to the transfection mixture. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was assayed on cell extracts 72 h post-adenofection. Differentiation of Human Preadipocytes, Adenovirus Infection, and Flow Cytometry—Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was obtained from female subjects undergoing plastic surgery in agreement with French laws on biomedical research. Human adipocytes in primary culture were differentiated as described by Hauner et al. (22Hauner H. Entenmann G. Wabitsch M. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. Pfeiffer E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) with modifications (23Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Stromal cells prepared from WAT were cultured for 13 days in a chemically defined medium. At day 13, 60–80% of cells were differentiated into lipid droplet-containing adipocytes. UCP1 mRNA levels in differentiated cells were similar to the levels found in native subcutaneous adipose tissue. 2C. Tiraby and D. Langin, unpublished data. Hence, differentiation of preadipocytes in primary culture did not result in the dysregulation of UCP1 gene expression. The cells were infected at a m.o.i. of 200 for 6 h. The day after infection, cells were treated as indicated in text and figure legends with the following drugs at 1 μm unless otherwise indicated: rosiglitazone (BRL49653, Smith Kline and French, Harlow, UK), Wy14643 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), L165041 (Merck), and 9-cis-RA (Sigma). Cells were harvested after 48 h of treatment for mRNA assays and 72 h of treatment for protein and fatty acid oxidation assays. To isolate adenovirus-transduced cells, GFP-positive cells were sorted, after trypsinization, using an EPICS Altra Hypersort System (Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France). Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Total RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase I (DNase I amplification grade, Invitrogen), then retrotranscribed using random hexamers and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time quantitative PCR was performed on GeneAmp 7000 Sequence Detection System using SYBR green chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) as described (24Clément K. Viguerie N. Diehn M. Alizadeh A. Barbe P. Thalamas C. Storey J.D. Brown P.O. Barsh G.S. Langin D. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Primers were designed using the Primer Express 1.5 software (Table I). Some mRNAs were quantified using Assay-on-Demand gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as control to normalize gene expression using the ribosomal RNA control Taqman assay kit (Applied Biosystems). Similar results were obtained using SYBR green- and Assay-on-Demand-based detections for the quantification of PGC-1α and UCP1 mRNA levels.Table IPrimers used in real time quantitative PCRmRNAAccession numberSense primerAntisense primerAmplicon sizebpALBPBC0036725′-GCATGGCCAAACCTAACATGA-3′5′-CCTGGCCCAGTATGAAGGAAA-3′105Cyt.cBC0084775′-AGGCCCCTGGATACTCTTACACAG-3′5′-TCAGTGTATCCTCTCCCCAGATG-3′69M-CPT1D878125′-TACAACAGGTGGTTTGACA-3′5′-CAGAGGTGCCCAATGATG-3′105GKNT_0163545′-GCAGAAGGAGTCGGCGTATG-3′5′-CCCAACCCATTGACTTCATCA-3′145MCADAF2510435′-AGCTCCTGCTAATAAAGCCTTTACTG-3′5′-CATGTTTAATTCCTTTCTCCCAATC-3′85hPGC-1αAF1597145′-CTGTGTCACCACCCAAATCCTTAT-3′5′-TGTGTCGAGAAAAGGACCTTGA-3′78hmPGC-1αNM_0089045′-AAAGGATGCGCTCTCGTTCA-3′5′-GGAATATGGTGATCGGGAACA-3′65hUCP1NM_0218335′-TGCCCAACTGTGCAATGAA-3′5′-TCGCAAGAAGGAAGGTACCAA-3′80mUCP1NM_0094635′-CCTGCCTCTCTCGGAAACAA-3′5′-TGTAGGCTGCCCAATGAACA-3′75 Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Mitochondria from mouse BAT and human adipocytes were prepared by differential centrifugation in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Mitochondrial proteins (5 μg for human adipocytes and 0.2 μg for BAT) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France), and probed with a polyclonal anti-rat UCP1 antibody (25Ricquier D. Barlet J.P. Garel J.M. Combes-George M. Dubois M.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and an anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen, Le Pont de Claix, France). Immunoreactive protein was determined by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo Adenovirus Injection in Mouse Fat Pad—Studies with mice followed the INSERM and Louis Bugnard Institute Animal Care Facility guidelines. Male B6D2/JIco mice (24–30 weeks old, IFFA-CREDO, L'Arbresle, France) were anesthetized with avertin (Sigma). Following dissection of the skin and body wall, one testis with attached epididymal fat pad was pulled out. The adenoviral preparation (1.7 × 108 infectious particles) was injected to 6 points in the fat pad. A fat pad was injected with PGC-1α adenovirus and the contralateral fat pad with GFP adenovirus. After 5 days, total RNA was prepared from the fat pads for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses. Palmitate Oxidation Experiment—Differentiated human adipocytes were incubated for 3 h in a medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2 mm l-carnitine, 50 μm palmitate, and 118 nm [14C]palmitate (850 μCi/μmol, Amersham Biosciences). Medium was transferred in a flask with a center well containing Carbosorb E (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Courtaboeuf, France). 14CO2 was liberated by acidification with 5 n HCl and collected overnight on Carbosorb. 14CO2 was measured by scintillation counting. The acid-soluble fraction of the medium containing 14C-labeled β-oxidation metabolites were measured by scintillation counting after 1-butanol extraction of palmitate. To inhibit fatty acid oxidation, we used 50 μm etomoxir (from Wolfgang Langhans, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland). To study the effect of mitochondrial uncoupling, m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (Sigma) was added at 10 μm during the 3-h incubation period. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance with least-square difference post-hoc analysis or Student's t test. The Nuclear Receptor PPARγ2 and Its Coactivator PGC-1α Transactivate the Human UCP1 Promoter—To test the transcriptional coactivation of the human UCP1 promoter by PGC-1α, we utilized an adenovirus expressing human PGC-1α in combination with expression vectors for PPARγ2 and its partner, RXRα. PGC-1α functions as a transcriptional coactivator for the two nuclear receptors (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar, 26Delerive P. Wu Y. Burris T.P. Chin W.W. Suen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3913-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The 6300-bp human UCP1 promoter region mediates the stimulation of transcription by TZD in a murine brown adipocyte cell line (21Del Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Pecqueur C. Gelly C. Sanchis D. Alves-Guerra M.-C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31722-31732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In simian CV-1 cells, the PPARγ2/RXRα combination had no transactivation potency (Fig. 1). The expression of PGC-1α alone induced a modest rise of UCP1 gene transcription. However, the addition of PGC-1α to the PPARγ2/RXRα combination led to a marked increase in activity. PGC-1α Induces UCP1 Expression in Human White Adipocyte—Human WAT express low levels of PGC-1α (20Larrouy D. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Laville M. Langin D. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We used a human PGC-1α adenovirus to increase the expression of the coactivator in primary culture of human subcutaneous adipocytes (Fig. 2A). Unlike retroviral vector systems that must be used on proliferating preadipocytes, adenoviruses can transduce quiescent mature adipocytes (27Hertzel A.V. Sanders M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1082-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This method permits to avoid the effect of continuous PGC-1α expression during adipogenesis. The PGC-1α adenovirus efficiently transduced differentiated adipocytes as revealed by GFP labeling of 40–50% fat cells. Remarkably, adenoviral infection occurred exclusively in differentiated cells (Fig. 2B). There was no GFP staining in undifferentiated fibroblasts. To ascertain that preadipocytes were resistant to adenoviral infection, human fibroblasts at day 3 of culture were infected with PGC-1α adenovirus at various multiplicity of infections. No increase in PGC-1α mRNA was observed at an m.o.i. of 500. At m.o.i. of 1000 and 2000, PGC-1α mRNA were only increased by 3- and 5-fold, respectively, whereas the induction was 100–150-fold in day 13 differentiated adipocytes at a m.o.i. of 200. The data reveal that human adipocytes possess much more efficient plasma membrane binding and internalization components for human serotype 5 adenovirus than preadipocytes. The effects mediated by PGC-1α can thereby be ascribed to its selective overexpression in adipocytes. The robust overexpression of PGC-1α in human adipocytes was accompanied by an induction of UCP1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A). UCP1 mRNA was barely detectable in cells infected with control GFP adenovirus. The marked increase associated with PGC-1α expression was amplified in the presence of PPARγ and RXRα ligands (p < 0.01). As shown on Fig. 3B, the mRNA level of UCP1 paralleled that of PGC-1α when cells were transduced at different multiplicity of infections. The expression of GFP allowed us to select the transduced cells using flow cytometry (Fig. 3C). Cells infected with PGC-1α adenovirus and treated with TZD and RA co-expressed PGC-1α and UCP1 mRNA. These data show that the induction of UCP1 is restricted to adipocytes expressing PGC-1α. Western blot analysis showed an increase of a 32-kDa immunoreactive band corresponding to UCP1 (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained using an antibody raised against the whole rat protein (25Ricquier D. Barlet J.P. Garel J.M. Combes-George M. Dubois M.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or an antibody directed against a 19-amino acid C-terminal UCP1 peptide.2 As for the mRNA level, the addition of PPARγ/RXRα ligands further increased UCP1 protein expression. The amount of UCP1 mRNA and protein in transduced and treated human adipocyte cultures represented 1.0 ± 0.4 and 1.6 ± 0.6% (n = 4) of the corresponding levels in mouse brown fat.Fig. 4Western blot analysis of UCP1 and cytochrome c expression. Mitochondrial proteins were prepared from mouse BAT (0.2 μg) and human white adipocytes (5 μg). Adipocytes were treated with rosiglitazone (Rosi) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PPARγ Cooperates with PGC-1α to Induce UCP1 Expression—To determine which PPAR was involved in PGC-1α coactivation of UCP1 expression, we tested ligands for the three subtypes of nuclear receptors (Fig. 3D). Rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, was a potent stimulator of UCP1 expression. Agonists for PPARα and PPARβ and 9-cis-RA had poor inducing potency. The data show the pre-eminent role of the PPARγ/PGC-1α association for the induction of UCP1 in human white adipocytes. PGC-1α-expressing Adipocytes Show Increased Expression of Mitochondrial Proteins and Brown Adipocyte Markers—We wished to determine whether the up-regulation of UCP1 in TZD-treated PGC-1α-overexpressing human adipocytes was associated with other metabolically relevant adaptations in gene expression. PGC-1α induces expression of components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in several cell types (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M.

The mRNAs for cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase 4 were increased (Fig. 5). An induction of cytochrome c was found at the protein level (Fig. 4). We also observed an induction in the mRNA expression of mitofusin 2, a mitochondrial protein essential for mitochondrial network architecture highly expressed in brown adipose tissue (28Bach D. Pich S. Soriano F.X. Vega N. Baumgartner B. Oriola J. Daugaard J.R. Lloberas J. Camps M. Zierath J.R. Rabasa-Lhoret R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Laville M. Palacin M. Vidal H. Rivera F. Brand M.

Ectopic expression of PGC-1α and PPARα in 3T3-L1 murine fibroblasts leads to an increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzyme gene expression (29Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the mRNA levels for muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, the isoform of CPT1 expressed in human white adipocytes (30Brown N.F. Hill J.K. Esser V. Kirkland J.L. Corkey B.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD). Treated PGC-1α-expressing adipocytes showed higher muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and MCAD mRNA levels than control cells. Glycerol kinase activity is very low in WAT while relatively high levels are found in BAT (31Chakrabarty K. Chaudhuri B. Jeffay H. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGC-1α in the presence of TZD and RA led to a 7-fold induction of glycerokinase mRNA levels. PGC-1α Does Not Alter TZD Response of Typical White Adipocyte Target Genes—We next investigated the effect of PGC-1α on the response of WAT genes regulated by TZD (Fig. 6). Adipocyte lipid-binding protein and cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase are direct targets of TZD in white adipocytes with identified PPARγ responsive elements (32Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar, 33Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Rosiglitazone increased adipocyte lipid-binding protein and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 mRNA levels in cells transduced with PGC-1α or GFP adenovirus. Hence, the expression of PGC-1α was not accompanied by a loss of TZD response of target genes. PGC-1α Stimulates UCP1 mRNA Expression in Mouse White Fat Pads in Vivo—We then asked whether overexpression of PGC-1α could induce UCP1 in vivo. The PGC-1α adenovirus was injected in the epididymal fat pad of male mice. This fat pad was selected because it contains very few brown fat cells (34Commins S.P. Watson P.M. Padgett M.A. Dudley A. Argyropoulos G. Gettys T.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Compared with the contralateral side injected with GFP adenovirus, the increase in PGC-1α mRNA level was accompanied by a more than 10-fold induction of UCP1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3E). The experiment reveals that PGC-1α is able to induce UCP1 gene expression in WAT in vivo. PGC-1α Increases Fat Oxidation in Human White Adipocytes—We hypothesized that an induction of UCP1, proteins of the respiratory chain, and enzymes of fatty acid oxidation may lead to an increased capacity of fat oxidation. Fig. 7 shows that PGC-1α-expressing human adipocytes had higher total fatty acid oxidation than cells infected with the GFP adenovirus. The effect was mimicked by the chemical mitochondrial uncoupler, m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone. This data reveals that, in human adipocytes, uncoupling of the respiratory chain is associated with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. There was both an increase in the production of CO2 and β-oxidation metabolites.2 Addition of rosiglitazone potentiated the effect of PGC-1α (p < 0.01). Compared with basal conditions, total oxidation was doubled. Addition of etomoxir, a CPT1 inhibitor, abolished palmitate oxidation. The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α may play an important role in adaptive thermogenesis in rodents through a positive regulation of mitochondrial proteins (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W.

The mechanisms through which gastric epithelial cells recognize this organism are unclear. In this study we evaluated the interactions between the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and H. pylori-mediated NF-κB activation and the induction of chemokine mRNA expression. By reverse transcriptase-PCR we determined that MKN45 gastric epithelial cells express low but detectable amounts of TLR2, -4, and -5 but no MD-2. To determine which, if any, TLRs may play a role in the response of epithelial cells to H. pylori, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the NF-κB-Luc reporter, CD14 and MD2 expression plasmids, and expression plasmids for TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5. Infection of the cultures with H. pylori (strain 26695) induced NF-κB activity in cells transfected with TLR2 and TLR5, but not TLR4. Consistent with the HEK293 experiments, H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation was decreased in MKN45 gastric epithelial cells by transfection of dominant-negative versions of TLR2 and TLR5 but not TLR4. Highly purified lipopolysaccharide from H. pylori strain 26695 activated NF-κB in HEK293 via TLR2 but not TLR4. Partially purified flagellin from H. pylori was also capable of inducing NF-κB activation in HEK cells transfected with TLR5. Additionally, chemokine gene expression was induced by H. pylori in HEK293 cells following stable transfection with TLR2 or TLR5 expression plasmids. These studies demonstrate that gastric epithelial cells recognize and respond to H. pylori infection at least in part via TLR2 and TLR5. Furthermore, the unique lipopolysaccharide of H. pylori is a TLR2, not a TLR4 agonist.

Furthermore, the unique lipopolysaccharide of H. pylori is a TLR2, not a TLR4 agonist. Helicobacter pylori is a spiral, microaerophilic, Gram-negative bacteria that colonizes gastric epithelial cells and the gastric mucosal layer in 25–50% of the population in developed countries and 70–90% in developing countries, for an estimated 2 billion people worldwide. Whereas most infected individuals are asymptomatic, H. pylori is a causative agent of peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. The specific clinical outcome is determined by the interplay of H. pylori virulence factors, host gastric mucosal factors, and the environment. However, the mechanisms by which bacterial and/or host factors cause disease remain unclear. Gastric epithelial cells respond to infection with H. pylori by activating numerous signal transduction cascades. To date, the responses that have been best characterized are those which lead to expression and activation of c-fos and c-jun via mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (1Meyer-ter-Vehn T.

One result of the activation of these pathways is the production of large amounts of IL-8 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8, interleukin-8; TLR, Toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RT, reverse transcriptase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. by the gastric epithelial cells (2Keates S.

The mechanisms involved in the regulation of IL-8 production by H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells have been extensively studied. Aihara et al. (4Aihara M. Tsuchimoto D. Takizawa H. Azuma A. Wakebe H. Ohmoto Y. Imagawa K. Kikuchi M. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3218-3224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that AP-1 and NF-κB cooperate to regulate IL-8 gene expression in MKN45 cells. Mutation of both the AP-1 and NF-κB-binding sites in the IL-8 promoter resulted in a decrease in the response to H. pylori infection. Mutation of the AP-1 site alone resulted in a crippled promoter that was only partially responsive to H. pylori. In contrast, mutation of the NF-κB site resulted in a promoter that was completely nonresponsive to H. pylori infection demonstrating the critical importance of NF-κB in the response. Maeda et al. (6Maeda S. Yoshida H. Ogura K. Mitsuno Y. Hirata Y. Yamaji Y. Akanuma M. Shiratori Y. Omata M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) further demonstrated that H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation in gastric epithelial cells involved IκB kinases, NIK, TRAF2, and TRAF6. Cells of the innate immune system sense and respond to microbial products via the Toll-like receptor family. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are an evolutionarily conserved family of cell surface molecules that participate in innate immune recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (7Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Pathogen-associated molecular patterns are generally unique, chemically diverse products with conserved motifs that are produced by microorganisms. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns often have an essential role in the structure of bacteria and generally cannot be subtly modified as a result of mutation without adversely affecting microbial growth or pathogencity. Examples include LPS (specifically lipid A), peptidoglycan, lipoproteins, bacterial DNA, and bacterial flagella. At least 10 different TLRs have been identified. In some cases the bacterial ligand has also been identified. For example, TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan (8Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) and bacterial lipoproteins (9Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14459-14463Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). TLR4 recognizes LPS from most Gram-negative species (10Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D.

The signaling events occurring downstream of the TLRs are rapidly being elucidated and appear to have many common features. In general, the cascade of events occurring following ligation of the different TLRs involves the activation of a common set of adapter proteins and protein kinases, the best characterized of which leads to the activation of NF-κB (reviewed in Refs. 13Vasselon T. Detmers P.A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and 14Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys.

Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) as being involved in H. pylori-induced NF-κB activation are also associated with responses downstream of the Toll-like receptors. The identity of the cell surface signaling molecule(s) responsible for the H. pylori-induced responses is still unclear. One potential signaling receptor for H. pylori that has been examined in the literature is TLR4, originally identified as the signaling molecule responsible for cellular responses to LPS (10Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Immun. 2001; 69: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) demonstrated that H. pylori LPS stimulates TLR4 and induces mitogen oxidase 1 gene expression in guinea pig gastric pit cells. However, other investigators have provided evidence that H. pylori LPS does not stimulate human gastric epithelial cell lines (3Maeda S. Akanuma M. Mitsuno Y. Hirata Y. Ogura K. Yoshida H.

To better clarify the role of Toll-like receptors in the responses of epithelial cells to H. pylori infection, we examined the activation of NF-κB in HEK293 cells transfected with specific TLR expression constructs and in the human gastric cancer cell line MKN45 expressing dominant negative versions of TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5. Our results indicated that live H. pylori induced NF-κB activation because of ligation of TLR2 and TLR5, but not TLR4. In addition, we have determined that LPS derived from H. pylori strain 26695 is a TLR2 agonist and demonstrate that the inability of MKN45 cells to respond to typical TLR4 agonists is because of a lack of the TLR4 accessory molecule MD2. Reagents—LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5) was obtained from Sigma and H. pylori LPS was purified as described below. Prior to use, both LPS preparations were subjected to an additional purification procedure as described by Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immun. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in E. coli LPS that was free from contaminating endotoxin protein and is a specific TLR4 agonist. The synthetic lipopetide PAM3CSK4 was provided by Prof. G. Jung, Tübingen, Germany. Peptidoglycan purified from Staphyloccous aureus was purchased from Fluka. Plasmid Constructs—Human TLR2, TLR4, and MD-2 expression plasmids were previously described (19Carl V.S. Brown-Steinke K. Nicklin M.J. Smith Jr., M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17448-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The TLR5 cDNA corresponding to the entire coding region was generated by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using primers corresponding to the published sequences and cloned into pcDNA3.1Zeo (Invitrogen). Dominant-negative versions of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 were created by generating truncated cDNAs that resulted in deletion of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule (TLR2 truncated at amino acid 670, TLR4 at 700, and TLR5 at 685). Sequences of all clones were confirmed by automated sequencing. The human CD14 expression vector, pRc/RSVCD14, was a gift of R. Ulevitch (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA); NF-κB-Luc was from Clontech. All plasmid DNAs were isolated by using endotoxin-free preparation kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and AGS cells were from ATCC, MKN45 cells were purchased from the JCRB Cell Bank (Japan), and CHO-CD14 cells were a gift of D. Golenbock (University of Massachusetts). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS (Hyclone), AGS cells in Ham's F-12 + 10% FBS and MKN45 in RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS. All cells were transfected in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Each transfection contained 500 ng of NF-κB-Luc (Clontech), 50 ng of TLR expression vector or pcDNA3.1Zeo, 50 ng of pEF6-MD2, 100 ng of pRc/RSVCD14, and 200 ng of pTK-Renilla (Promega) and 4 μl of LipofectAMINE. Transfections were performed in triplicate, cultured for 24 h, and then stimulated as indicated. Luciferase activities were determined using the dual luciferase kit from Promega and all activities were normalized to the activity of the cotransfected TK-Renilla plasmid. RT-PCR of TLR mRNA—Total RNA was purified from cell lines using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription (RT) of 0.5 μg of total cellular RNA was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 1 mm of each dNTP, 20 units of placental RNase inhibitor, 5 μm random hexamer, and 9 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, the samples were heated for 5 min at 92 °C to end the reaction and stored at –20 °C until PCR use. PCR was performed for 30 cycles under standard conditions using 2 μl of cDNA. Primers were generated such that the 5′ and 3′ primers were in separate exons.

Open table in a new tab Primary Culture of H. pylori—Gastric antrum specimens were taken from two patients recruited at the endoscopy unit at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, according to the protocols outlined in a study approved by their Institutional Review Board. The specimens were placed in sterile normal saline and transported on ice. Homogenized tissues were cultured for <7 days at 37 °C on blood agar in an incubator containing 10% CO2. H. pylori growth was confirmed by Gram stain, and oxidase, catalase, and urease reactivity. The two isolates used in these studies were termed Hp98 and Hp99. H. pylori strain LC11 was a gift from P. Sherman (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (5Crowe S.E. Alvarez L. Dytoc M. Hunt R.H. Muller M. Sherman P. Patel J. Jin Y. Ernst P.B. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 65-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and strain 26695 was from K. Eaton (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). H. pylori in Vitro Infection—All H. pylori strains were grown for 24 h on Remel sheep blood agar plates, in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. One plate of bacteria was harvested with a sterile cotton swab and resuspended in 1 ml of Brucella broth. The bacteria were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 6000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 1 ml of Brucella broth. This wash procedure was repeated and the bacteria were thoroughly resuspended in 1 ml of Brucella broth. Thirty microliters of the H. pylori suspension were plated to verify the multiplicity of infection. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the media was removed from the HEK293 or MKN45 cells and was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS or RPMI with 10% FBS, respectively. H. pylori then were added to the eukaryotic cells at a multiplicity of infection of 200–300:1. The infection proceeded for 24 h at 37 °C and 10% CO2. H. pylori LPS Extraction—H. pylori strain 26695 was grown on Remel sheep blood agar at 37 °C, in 10% CO2 for 72 h. The confluent bacterial growth from 900 plates was harvested from each plate with 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The biomass was pooled and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently freezedried, yielding ∼5 g of dried biomass. The LPS was extracted using the hot phenol-water protocol of Moran et al. (20Moran A.P. Lindner B. Walsh E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6453-6463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by protease treatment. All equipment was treated with EtoxaClean to remove all endotoxin contaminants. Briefly, the biomass was resuspended in endotoxin-free water at a concentration of 1 g/ml and homogenized for 10 min at high speed in a Sorvall Omni mixer. An equal volume of liquified phenol was added to the bacterial suspension and heated at 65 °C for 1 h. The solution was then blended for regular 2-min intervals, for a total of 10 min, at high speed in a Sorvall Omni mixer, and then cooled on ice. The mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the aqueous layer was collected. An equal volume of endotoxin-free water was added to the remaining phenol layer, mixed, and the centrifugation and collection steps were repeated for a total of 3 aqueous layer collections. The aqueous phases were combined and dialyzed against 6 liters of endotoxin-free water for 72 h to remove all residual phenol and freeze-dried. The crude LPS was resuspended at 10 mg/ml in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mg/10 ml of DNase II and RNase A, and 0.1 mg/10 ml of proteinase K. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and then at 65 °C for an additional 16 h. The enzyme-treated LPS was dialyzed again against 6 liters of endotoxin-free water over 72 h to remove degraded compounds. The resulting solution was freeze-dried for 48 h. Prior to use, LPS was subjected to an additional purification procedure as described by Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immun. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). H. pylori Flagellin Preparation—H. pylori 26695 were grown on Remel sheep blood agar at 37 °C, in 10% CO2 for 72 h. The bacteria were harvested from each plate with 1 ml of sterile Brucella broth. Bacteria from 100 plates were pooled and were blended for 1 min at high speed in a Sorvall Omni mixer. Bacterial cells were removed from solution by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min. The supernatant containing the sheared H. pylori flagella was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min. The supernatant was discarded and the flagellar pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Total protein concentration of the flagellin preparation was determined by the Bradford method using Pierce BCA reagents and protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was purified using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RT of 0.5 μg of total cellular RNA was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 1 mm of each dNTP, 20 units of placental RNase inhibitor, 5 μm random hexamer, and 9 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, the samples were heated for 5 min at 92 °C to end the reaction and stored at –20 °C until PCR use. Two μl of cDNA was subjected to real-time quantitative PCR using the Opticon system (MJ Research) with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) as a fluorescent reporter. Chemokine and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase cDNAs were amplified in separate reactions. Threshold cycle number, of duplicate reactions, was determined using the Opticon software and levels of chemokine mRNA expression were normalized to hypoxanthine phsophoribosyltransferase levels using the formula 2( Rt – Et ), where Rt is the mean threshold cycle for the reference gene (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase) and Et is the mean threshold cycle for the experimental gene. Data are thus expressed as arbitrary units. Primer sequences are provided in Table I. Toll-like Receptor mRNA Expression in AGS and MKN45 Gastric Epithelial Cell Lines—To determine which TLRs are expressed on gastric epithelial cells and thus may participate in the response to H. pylori we examined TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and MD2 mRNA expression by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, AGS and MKN45 cells express mRNA for TLR4 and TLR5. TLR2 mRNA expression was not detectable in AGS cells, but could be readily detectable in MKN45 cells. The expression of MD2, a critical co-factor for the ability of TLR4 to recognize LPS, was not detected in AGS or MKN45 cells. Thus, although both gastric epithelial cell lines examined express the mRNA for the LPS signaling molecule TLR4, the lack of MD2 expression suggests that these cells may lack the ability to signal via TLR4. We next determined the capacity of MKN45 cells to activate NF-κB in response to TLR ligands. MKN45 cells were transiently transfected with a NF-κB/luciferase reporter plasmid and abilities of the synthetic lipopetide PAM3CSK4 (a TLR2 agonist), highly purified E. coli LPS (a TLR4 agonist), or live H. pylori, to induce luciferase expression were determined. As shown in the transfection experiment in Fig. 2A, PAM3CSK4 and H. pylori were capable of activating NF-κB in MKN45 cells, whereas E. coli LPS could not. Similar results were seen using another TLR2 agonist, peptidoglycan (data not shown). Thus, MKN45 cells are in fact responsive to at least some TLR agonists. To determine whether the inability of MKN45 cells to respond to E. coli LPS was because of the lack of MD2 expression, the experiment in Fig. 2B was performed. MKN45 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for CD14 and MD2 (or empty vector control) along with the NF-κB reporter. E. coli LPS was capable of activating NF-κB but only when the MD2 expression plasmid was cotransfected. These results indicate that MKN45 cells do in fact express a functional TLR4 protein but because of the lack of MD2 expression they are incapable of responding to LPS. This then provides a potential explanation for the lack of effect of H. pylori LPS on MKN45 cells observed by Aihara et al. (4Aihara M. Tsuchimoto D. Takizawa H. Azuma A. Wakebe H. Ohmoto Y. Imagawa K. Kikuchi M. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3218-3224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori Activates NF-κB in HEK293 Cells via TLR2 and TLR5—To determine which, if any, TLRs may play a role in the response of epithelial cells to H. pylori, we chose to examine the H. pylori-induced NF-κB response in HEK293 cells transfected with TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5. In the representative transfection experiment (of 3 total) shown in Fig. 3, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the NF-κB-Luc reporter, CD14 and MD2 expression plasmids, and either empty pcDNA3.1 vector or expression plasmids for TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5. Cultures were stimulated with either purified TLR ligands (Pam3CSK4 for TLR2 or E. coli LPS for TLR4) or live H. pylori for 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity. The results indicated that cells transfected with TLR2 or TLR5 expression plasmids, but not TLR4, were capable of activating NF-κB in response to H. pylori. The transfected TLR4 was indeed functional as demonstrated by the ability of the cells to activate NF-κB in response to E. coli LPS. This surprising result prompted us to examine other H. pylori strains to determine whether the lack of TLR4 response observed for strain 26695 was a specific attribute of that particular laboratory-adapted strain. To address this question, we performed infections of HEK293 cells transfected with either TLR2 or TLR4 expression plasmids using three additional strains of H. pylori: LC11 and two primary clinical isolates: HP98, and HP99. As shown in Fig. 3B, cotransfection of TLR2 but not TLR4 was able to confer the ability to activate NF-κBin response to infection with all three strains. These results additionally suggested that although H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium, it has either developed a mechanism to avoid detection via TLR4 or its unique LPS is not recognized by TLR4. Thus in HEK293 cells TLR2 and TLR5 can confer responsiveness to live H. pylori infection. Role of Toll-like Receptors on Gastric Epithelial Cells in Response to H. pylori Infection—The studies described above indicated that in a reconstitution experiment, TLRs can participate in the response of epithelial cells to H. pylori. To determine the role of endogenously expressed TLRs in the response of gastric epithelial cells to H. pylori we chose to inhibit TLR function through the expression of dominant-negative TLR constructs. The TLRs function as dimers and expression of a mutated receptor, deleted of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain has been demonstrated to act as a repressor of TLR signaling. MKN45 cells were cotransfected with NF-κB-Luc and either empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1) or expression plasmids encoding truncated versions of TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5. Cultures were stimulated by addition of live H. pylori for 24 h. The results of a representative transfection experiment (of three) are shown in Fig. 4. Consistent with the results from the HEK293 experiments, cotransfection with dominant-negative TLR2 and TLR5, but not TLR4, resulted in an inhibition of the response of MKN45 cells to H. pylori infection. Thus, in a gastric epithelial cell line, as in the HEK293 cells, H. pylori activated NF-κB primarily via TLR2 and TLR5 but not TLR4. LPS from H. pylori Is a TLR2 Agonist—The data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 indicated that TLR2 and TLR5, but not TLR4, participated in the response to live H. pylori infection. This was a surprising result because H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium. However, this bacterium can produce two types of lipid A, a major tetraacyl and a minor hexaacyl variety with exceptionally long fatty acid chains (20Moran A.P. Lindner B. Walsh E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6453-6463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the tetraacyl lipid A moiety is clearly distinct from that found in Enterobacteriaceae and more closely resembles that found in Porphyromonas gingivalis, which is a TLR2 agonist (20Moran A.P. Lindner B. Walsh E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6453-6463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hirschfeld M. Weis J.J. Toshchakov V.V. Salkowski C.A. Cody M.J. Ward D.C. Qureshi N. Michalek S.M. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Notably, LPS from H. pylori has been shown to be less toxic than that of E. coli. To determine whether the H. pylori LPS is a TLR2 or a TLR4 agonist, we purified the LPS from strain 26695 according to the procedure of Moran et al. (20Moran A.P. Lindner B. Walsh E.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6453-6463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of three more extractions as described by Hirschfeld et al. (18Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immun. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) to yield highly purified, protein-free LPS. As shown in Fig. 5, HEK293 cells transfected with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter and TLR2, but not TLR4, responded to H. pylori 26695 LPS indicating that the LPS derived from this organism is predominantly a TLR2 agonist.

https://openalex.org/W2013139454,"Little is known about the biochemical basis of the action of free fatty acids (FFA) on breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here we report that unsaturated FFAs stimulated the proliferation of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, whereas saturated FFAs inhibited it and caused apoptosis. Saturated FFA palmitate decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and caused cytochrome c release. Palmitate-induced apoptosis was enhanced by the fat oxidation inhibitor etomoxir, whereas it was reduced by fatty-acyl CoA synthase inhibitor triacsin C. The non-metabolizable analog 2-bromopalmitate was not cytotoxic. This indicates that palmitate must be metabolized to exert its toxic effect but that its action does not involve fat oxidation. Pharmacological studies showed that the action of palmitate is not mediated via ceramides, reactive oxygen species, or changes in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. Palmitate caused early enhancement of cardiolipin turnover and decreased the levels of this mitochondrial phospholipid, which is necessary for cytochrome c retention. Cosupplementation of oleate, or increasing β-oxidation with the AMP-activated protein kinase activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribonucleoside, both restored cardiolipin levels and blocked palmitate-induced apoptosis. Oleate was preferentially metabolized to triglycerides, and oleate cosupplementation channeled palmitate esterification processes to triglycerides. Overexpression of Bcl-2 family members blocked palmitate-induced apoptosis. The results provide evidence that a decrease in cardiolipin levels and altered mitochondrial function are involved in palmitate-induced breast cancer cell death.

Epidemiological studies and experiments using animals have suggested that dietary fatty acids contribute to the risk of breast cancer (1Fay M.P. Freedman L.S. Clifford C.K. Midthune D.N.

They serve as a source of energy and as precursors of many signaling and structural molecules (4McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Foxworth W.D. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1371-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little information exists on the biochemical pathways by which different types of fatty acids influence breast cancer cell growth and death. The observation in breast cancer cells that overexpression of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis (fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase) correlates with poor prognosis strengthens the hypothesis that fatty acids are involved in the regulation of tumor cell growth (5Witters L.A. Widmer J. King A.N. Fassihi K. Kuhajda F. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Pizer E.S. Jackisch C. Wood F.D. Pasternack G.R. Davidson N.E. Kuhajda F.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2745-2747PubMed Google Scholar). Also, consistent with this view is the recent observation documenting an interaction of the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 with acetyl CoA-carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis (7Magnard C. Bachelier R. Vincent A. Jaquinod M. Kieffer S. Lenoir G.M. Venezia N.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6729-6739Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, we reported that various types of FFAs are not equivalent with respect to their actions on breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis: the monounsaturated FFA oleate (C18:1) stimulated the proliferation of breast cancer cells, whereas the saturated palmitate (C16:0) induced apoptosis (8Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the differential effect of these two FFAs came from the surprising observation that oleate and palmitate increased and decreased, respectively, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. The antagonistic action of saturated versus unsaturated FFAs on breast cancer cell growth control may explain the contradiction reported in the epidemiological literature with respect to fatty acids and cancer by pointing out that different FFAs are not equivalent as far as cell growth and tumor promotion are concerned (8Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar).Induction of apoptosis by palmitate has also been observed in other cell types, including cardiomyocytes (9Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), hematopoietic cells (10Paumen M.B. Ishida Y. Muramatsu M. Yamamoto M. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3324-3329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), pancreatic β-cells (11Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), and astrocytes (12Blazquez C. Galve-Roperh I. Guzman M. FASEB. J. 2000; 14: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), but, for most of these cell types, the mechanism by which palmitate induces cell death remains elusive. It has been proposed that excess palmitate could induce cell death through increased intracellular concentration of ceramide (10Paumen M.B. Ishida Y. Muramatsu M. Yamamoto M. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3324-3329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), a metabolite exclusively produced from saturated FFAs. However, this hypothesis has been challenged by work suggesting that apoptosis induced by palmitate could occur through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and not through ceramide synthesis (13Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Alternatively, palmitate-induced apoptosis in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes has been attributed to an important diminution of cardiolipin (CL) synthesis, correlating well with the extent of cytochrome c release into the cytosol (14Ostrander D.B. Sparagna G.C. Amoscato A.A. McMillin J.B. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38061-38067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CL is an anionic phospholipid containing four unsaturated fatty acids responsible for insertion and retention of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial membrane (15Choi S. Swanson J.M. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 54: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Rytomaa M. Kinnunen P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is located exclusively in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion and particularly at intermembrane contact sites (17Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Whether palmitate influences the CL level in breast cancer cells remains unknown.The central role of mitochondria, the main intracellular source of energy, in palmitate metabolism raises the possibility that palmitate-induced changes in mitochondria could impact the process of breast cancer cell death. Mitochondria play a crucial role in several processes linked to apoptosis (18Thress K. Kornbluth S. Smith J.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Apoptotic stimuli produce the release of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins into the cytosol, like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis-inducing factor (19Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 20Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Release of cytochrome c in the cytosol subsequently triggers the activation of caspases, substrate cleavage, and cell death (19Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). The mechanism that mediates the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria is unclear. In one view, the release occurs following mitochondrial permeability transition as a consequence of the opening of a large pore called the permeability transition pore (22Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cytochrome c release has been attributed to the formation of nonspecific holes in the mitochondria that does not involve mitochondrial permeability transition (23Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). By whatever mechanism cytochrome c is released, members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins control this key step in the apoptotic process. Some members inhibit cytochrome c release and promote cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w), whereas others, by mediating cytochrome c release, promote apoptosis (Bax, Bak, and Bid) (24Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar).In the present study, the mechanism by which the saturated fatty acid, palmitate, induces apoptosis in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was investigated. The results suggest that mitochondria and CL play a critical role in palmitate-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In addition, they allow us to propose a model explaining the lipotoxic action of palmitate and other saturated fatty acids.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC, triacsin C, fumonisin B1, and LY294002 were from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Fatty acids sodium salts were purchased from Nu-Check Prep (Elysian, MN). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fraction V), etomoxir, and AICAR were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6)(3) was from Molecular Probes Inc.

[3H]Thymidine (specific activity, 71 Ci/mmol) and [14C]palmitate (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA), and [14C]oleate (specific activity, 60 mCi/mmol) and [32P]H3PO4 were from Amersham Biosciences (Baie d'Urfé, Québec, Canada).Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in phenol red-free minimal essential medium (MEM) containing non-essential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (standard medium). Albumin-bound fatty acids were prepared by stirring fatty acid sodium salts (≥99% purity) at 37 °C with 5% BSA essentially fatty acid-free as described before (25Roche E. Buteau J. Aniento I. Reig J.A. Soria B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2007-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After being adjusted to pH 7.4, the solution was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and the fatty acid concentration was measured using a NEFA C kit (Wako Chemicals, GmbH). When BSA-bound fatty acids were added to serum-free culture medium, the final concentration of BSA was always adjusted to 0.5%.[3H]Thymidine Incorporation—For cell growth experiments, a protocol similar to the one already detailed was used (8Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h in standard medium. After a 24-h starvation period in medium without serum but with 0.5% BSA, cells were incubated without or with BSA-bound fatty acids for 24 h. DNA synthesis was then assayed with a pulse of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) during the last 4 h of incubation. Cells were harvested with a PHD cell harvester from Cambridge Technology (Watertown, MA), and the radioactivity retained on the dried glass fiber filters was measured by liquid scintillation.Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Cells were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish and incubated for 24 h in standard medium. After 12 h of serum starvation in medium containing 0.5% BSA, cells were incubated in serum-free medium without or with BSA-bound fatty acids. Caspase activity was determined using the ApoAlert caspase assay kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in lysis buffer. After determination of protein concentration using the BCA colorimetric assay (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) with BSA as a standard, 50 μg of protein was incubated with the fluorogenic peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC). The initial rate of release of free AFC was measured using a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Inc., Durham, NC) at an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm.Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Cells were cultured and incubated as described above. After treatment, cells were trypsinized, washed two times with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% BSA (PBS-BSA) and 0.2 μm DiOC6(3) (26Bedner E. Li X. Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed, resuspended in PBS-BSA, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected and resuspended in PBS-BSA containing 1 μm propidium iodide. DiOC6(3) fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using an Epics XL flow cytometer from Coulter (Miami, FL) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 500 nm. The percentage of cells with low mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) represents the percentage of gated cells displaying decreased DiOC6(3) fluorescence.Cytochrome c Release Analysis—Cells were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes at 1 × 106 cells/dish, cultured, and incubated as described above. At different times, cells were collected and resuspended in extraction buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors. After 10 min of incubation on ice, cells were homogenized with a syringe needle (25-gauge), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h. The supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was removed and stored at –80 °C until analysis by immunoblot as described previously (27Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar).Measurement of Ceramide Levels—Cells were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish and incubated as described above. Lipids were collected according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42178) Google Scholar). Ceramide levels were determined using the diacylglycerol kinase assay as described previously (29Perry D.K. Carton J. Shah A.K. Meredith F. Uhlinger D.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).Incorporation of Palmitate and Oleate into Various Complex Lipids— Cells seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish were incubated for 24 h in standard medium. After 12 h of serum starvation in medium containing 0.5% BSA, they were incubated for 1 h in serum-free medium supplemented with BSA-bound palmitate and/or oleate (0.1 mm) in the presence of 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]palmitate or [14C]oleate. Then, total lipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography as described (30Segall L. Lameloise N. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Roche E. Corkey P. Thumelin S. Corkey B.E. Prentki M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E521-E528PubMed Google Scholar). Spots corresponding to triacylglycerol (TG), diacylglycerol (DAG), cholesterol ester, and phospholipids were individually scraped and counted by liquid scintillation. Incorporation in neutral lipids and phospholipids was normalized for lipid recovery.Measurement of Phospholipid Levels—Phospholipid measurements were performed essentially as described previously (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42178) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes at 5 × 105 cells/dish and incubated for 24 h in standard medium. Cells were labeled for 24 h with [32P]Pi (20 μCi/ml), after which cells were incubated in serum-free medium without or with BSA-bound fatty acids in the presence of [32P]Pi (20 μCi/ml). For cardiolipin (CL) turnover experiments, cells were labeled as described above for 24 h, washed twice in PBS, and incubated in serum-free medium lacking [32P]Pi without or with BSA-bound fatty acids. After treatment, cells were washed, and lipids were extracted using a solution of CH3OH/CHCl3/0.1 m HCl (10:5:4). Lipids were then isolated by acid organic extraction (half volumes each of CHCl3 and 0.1 m HCl, 0.5 m NaCl), dried, and resuspended in an appropriate volume of CHCl3. Phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using silica gel plates (31Esko J.D. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4474-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and individual species were identified by comigration of standards (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO). The spots corresponding to CL and to phosphatidic acid (PA) plus phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were individually scraped, counted by liquid scintillation, and normalized to the total amount of label present in each sample.Adenovirus Infection—The adenovirus recombinants AdTREx-FLAG-Bcl-xL, AdTREx-FLAG-Bcl-w, and AdTREx-GFP expressing, respectively, the antiapoptotic mouse Bcl-xL and human Bcl-w proteins and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were provided by Gordon Shore. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 1.5 × 105 cells/well 24 h prior infection with the adenovirus recombinants at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units per cell. After 12 h of adsorption in MEM without serum in the presence of 0.5% BSA, cells were incubated in serum-free medium without or with BSA-bound palmitate for 24 h prior harvesting.RESULTSOpposite Effects of Unsaturated and Saturated Fatty Acids on the Proliferation and Apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 Cells—We showed previously that the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate stimulated the proliferation of three different breast cancer cell lines (8Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the saturated fatty acid palmitate induced apoptosis in these cells. Here, the effects of different unsaturated and saturated FFAs on the proliferation of serum-starved MDA-MB-231 cells were studied. All the tested unsaturated FFAs stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1A). The extent of stimulation ranged from 250% for oleate (C18:1) and linoleate (C18:2) to 170% for arachidonate (C20:4) and docohexanoate (C22:6). In contrast, the saturated FFAs myristate (C14:0), palmitate (C16:0), and stearate (C18:0) decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation by 50–95% when compared with control. Interestingly, 2-bromopalmitate, a non-metabolizable analog of palmitate, did not affect [3H]thymidine incorporation suggesting that palmitate has to be metabolized to exert its effect. The results indicate that, whereas unsaturated FFAs stimulate DNA replication in breast cancer cells, saturated FFAs inhibit it.The saturated fatty acid palmitate has been shown to be proapoptotic in MDA-MB-231 cells, because it induced the proteolysis of poly-ADP ribose polymerase and the cleavage of DNA into nucleosomal fragments, two hallmark features of apoptosis (8Hardy S. Langelier Y. Prentki M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6353-6358PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the cell proliferation inhibitory effect of the other saturated FFAs was related to apoptosis, we examined the activation of caspase-3 in serum-starved cells. Saturated FFAs increased caspase-3 activity by 2- to 7-fold, and this increase was correlated with their chain length (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the unsaturated FFA oleate decreased caspase-3 activity by 80%. Moreover, oleate protected cells against apoptosis triggered by saturated FFA, because the activity of caspase-3 was blocked when oleate was mixed in equimolar ratio with saturated FFAs. The results establish that saturated FFAs induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, an effect that can be counteracted by oleate.Mitochondria Play a Central Role in Palmitate-induced Apoptosis—To examine the mechanism by which saturated FFAs induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, we chose palmitate because it is the most abundant saturated FFA in the plasma. An examination of the time course of caspase-3 activation induced by palmitate revealed that the activation first seen at 6 h became significant at 8 h and thereafter continued to increase (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Time course of the effects of palmitate on various parameters of the apoptotic process in MDA-MB-231 cells. After 12 h of serum starvation in MEM in the presence of 0.5% BSA, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1 mm palmitate bound to BSA for the indicated times. A, caspase-3 activity in lysates from cells incubated with palmitate bound to BSA (0.5%) (Pal) or BSA alone (Cont) was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results represent the means ± S.E. of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.01 versus control. B, Δψm was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” “Δψmlow” represents the percentage of cells with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in the presence of palmitate (•) or oleate (0.1 mm) alone (▪). Values represent means ± S.E. of three separate experiments. *, p < 0.01 versus control. C, release of cytochrome c in the cytosol was studied using immunoblot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The figure shows a representative experiment that has been repeated two times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In certain types of cells, loss of Δψm is one of the steps preceding caspase activation during apoptosis (32Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The effect of palmitate on Δψm was analyzed by flow cytometry in intact cells with the strong cationic dye DiOC6(3). Damaged mitochondria lose membrane integrity and, as a consequence, are no longer able to maintain their transmembrane potential, resulting in a decreased binding of DiOC6(3). Palmitate induced within6ha significant increase in the percentage of cells with low Δψm, whereas no change occurred after 10 h of treatment with the unsaturated FFA oleate (Fig. 2B). Palmitate-induced depolarization of the membrane potential preceded the activation of caspase-3, suggesting that alteration of the mitochondria could be among the first steps in the apoptotic process induced by the fatty acid.The time dependence of cytochrome c release in the cytoplasm was examined by immunoblotting analysis. Basal amounts of cytochrome c were detected in cytosolic fraction until 4 h following palmitate treatment (Fig. 2C). A more than 3-fold increase in cytochrome c release was seen 6 h posttreatment, and, thereafter, cytochrome c levels remained elevated in the cytoplasm. Moreover, as for the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, palmitate-induced cytochrome c release preceded caspase-3 activation, suggesting that the mitochondrion is involved in the mechanism underlying palmitate-induced cell death.Alterations of Lipid Partitioning Affects Palmitate-induced Apoptosis—To provide further evidence that palmitate must be metabolized to exert its proapoptotic effect, we used the acyl-CoA synthetase specific inhibitor, triacsin C. Acyl-CoA synthetase activates fatty acids to fatty acyl-CoA, which are then channeled to different metabolic pathways (33Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Omura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To minimize the long term cytotoxic effect of triacsin C, caspase-3 activity was measured after a 12-h treatment. Under these conditions, triacsin C, which slightly increased apoptosis in control cells, reduced by 50% the proapoptotic effect of palmitate (Fig. 3A). Taken together, the results obtained with 2-bromopalmitate and triacsin C demonstrate that palmitate must be metabolized at least to the CoA derivative step (fatty acyl-CoA) to promote apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells.Fig. 3Alterations of lipid partitioning affect palmitate-induced apoptosis. A, after 12 h of serum starvation in the presence of 0.5% BSA in MEM, cells were incubated for 12 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1 mm palmitate bound to BSA (0.5%) (Pal) or BSA alone (Cont) in the absence or presence of 5 μm triacsin C. Apoptosis was evaluated by measuring caspase-3 activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent means ± S.E. of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.01 versus control; **, p < 0.01 versus palmitate. B, after 12 h of serum starvation in MEM in the presence of 0.5% BSA, cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1 mm palmitate bound to BSA (0.5%) (Pal) or BSA alone (Cont) in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm AICAR or 0.2 mm etomoxir. Values of caspase-3 activity represent the means ± S.E. of two (AICAR) or three (etomoxir) independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.01 versus palmitate alone.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2079136072,"We modeled how the charged levels of different transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that carry the same amino acid (isoacceptors) respond when this amino acid becomes growth-limiting. The charged levels will approach zero for some isoacceptors (such as tRNA2Leu) and remain high for others (such as tRNA4Leu), as determined by the concentrations of isoacceptors and how often their codons occur in protein synthesis. The theory accounts for (synonymous) codons for the same amino acid that are used in ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation, the choices of synonymous codons in trans-translating transfermessenger RNA, and the overrepresentation of rare codons in messenger RNAs for amino acid biosynthetic enzymes."

For RA to induce its biological effects in target cells, binding to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors is required. The resulting complexes bind to RA-responsive elements (RAREs) in the promoters of RA-inducible genes to initiate gene transcription and to generate protein products that mediate the biological effects of RA. In this report, we provide evidence that a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins, PKCδ, is activated during RA treatment of the NB-4 and HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Such RA-dependent phosphorylation was also observed in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and resulted in activation of the kinase domain of PKCδ. In studies aimed at understanding the functional relevance of PKCδ in the induction of RA responses, we found that pharmacological inhibition of PKCδ (but not of other PKC isoforms) diminished RA-dependent gene transcription via RAREs. On the other hand, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the kinase strongly enhanced RA-dependent gene transcription via RAREs. Gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that PKCδ associated with retinoic acid receptor-α and was present in an RA-inducible protein complex that bound to RAREs. Pharmacological inhibition of PKCδ activity abrogated the induction of cell differentiation and growth inhibition of NB-4 blast cells, demonstrating that its function is required for such effects.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate the induction of the biological effects of retinoids include a series of signaling events that are initiated by the binding of retinoids to specific receptors in the nucleus of target cells. Two families of retinoid receptors have been identified so far: retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (types α, β, and γ), which are activated by both RA and 9-cis-retinoic acid, and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (types α, β, and γ), which are activated only by 9-cis-retinoic acid (15Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 16Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

RA binds to the nuclear RARs and induces the formation of RAR·RXR heterodimers, which associate with specific DNA-binding sequences present in the promoters of RA-responsive genes called retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs). Such binding of RAR nuclear complexes to promoter RAREs results in initiation of transcription of genes whose protein products mediate RA biological responses (15Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 16Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

In addition to the induction of formation of RAR·RXR complexes, RA induces a variety of other cellular effects that appear to play a role in the generation of its effects on target cells. Such mechanisms via which retinoids induce their biological effects on malignant cells include inhibition of activation of the AP-1 protein via a CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein)-regulated mechanism (18Kamei Y.

On the other hand, RA induces activation of the MAPK ERK2 (23Yen A. Roberson M.S. Varvayanis S. Lee A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3163-3172PubMed Google Scholar) as well as activation of the p38 MAPK (24Alsayed Y. Uddin S. Mahmud N. Lekmine F. Kalvakolanu D. Minucci S. Bokoch G. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

The protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins is a multigene family of at least 12 serine/threonine kinases that participate in signal transduction events and are classified into three groups based on the differences in their structure and regulatory domains as well as differences in their activation requirements (25Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The protein members of this family of kinases exhibit serine kinase activities and, upon their activation, regulate phosphorylation/activation of other serine kinases, resulting in signals that ultimately mediate multiple biological responses. The tissue distribution of PKC isoforms varies considerably, with PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCζ being widely expressed, whereas most of the other isoforms are selectively expressed in different types of cells and tissues (25Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). PKCδ belongs to the group of novel PKC isoforms, which are Ca2+-independent and are activated by phorbol esters, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine (26Kikkawa U. Matsuzaki H. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that this kinase plays important roles in the induction of antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic responses in response to DNA-damaging agents and ionizing radiation (27Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 28Denning M.F.

Consistent with this, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of its catalytically active fragment is capable of inducing apoptosis of target cells (29Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Allen J. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that PKCδ is activated during treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and breast cancer cell lines with RA. Our data demonstrate that this PKC isoform forms complexes with RARα and binds to RAREs. Such a function of PKCδ plays a critical role in RA-dependent transcriptional regulation, as evidenced by the fact that inhibition of PKCδ kinase activity blocks RA-dependent gene transcription via RAREs. Consistent with this, pharmacological inhibition of PKCδ diminishes induction of cell differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia blast cells by RA and blocks RA-dependent suppression of cell growth, underscoring the critical role that this PKC isoform plays in the induction of RA responses. Cells and Reagents—The RA-sensitive human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB-4 and the acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Polyclonal antibodies against PKCδ and Stat1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An antibody against PKCδ phosphorylated/activated at Thr505 was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). An antibody against Stat1 phosphorylated at Ser727 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin and the PKCα inhibitor Go 6976 were obtained from Calbiochem. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia, after obtaining informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University.

Briefly, cells were treated for the indicated times with retinoic acid and were then lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCδ antibody, and immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 20 μm ATP) and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of histone H1 as an exogenous substrate, to which 20–30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added. The reaction was incubated for 15–30 min at room temperature and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer.

The cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline; and after cell lysis, luciferase activities were measured following the protocol of Promega. The measured luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activity for each sample. In other experiments, MCF-7 cells were transfected with a 8XGAS-luciferase construct; and 48 h after transfection, triplicate cultures were either left untreated or treated with interferon (IFN)-α (5000 units/ml), RA, rottlerin, or combinations of the these agents. In the experiments in which the effects of overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active PKCδ on RARE-dependent gene transcription were evaluated, the cells were transfected with the pcDNA3-PKC-WT construct (42Soh J.-W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) or the pcDNA3-PKC-CAT construct, which encodes a truncated protein in which the catalytic domain (CAT) of PKC is preserved and the regulatory N-terminal domain is deleted, thereby generating a constitutively active catalytic domain (provided by Dr. J.-W.

Cell Proliferation Assays—Cell proliferation assays using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay system were performed as described in a previous study (43Mayer I.A.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed essentially as described previously (44Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M.

ChIP DNA was used as a template for PCR using DR5 RARE forward (5′-CAC TGC AGA AAC AGC CAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CAT GGG CAG GCT GAT AAG-3′) primers. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometric studies were performed as in our previous study (24Alsayed Y. Uddin S. Mahmud N. Lekmine F. Kalvakolanu D. Minucci S. Bokoch G. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4012-4019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, NB-4 cells were treated with Me2SO or RA in the presence or absence of 1 μm rottlerin for 5 days, and cell differentiation was determined by staining with anti-CD11b monoclonal antibody. The anti-CD11b monoclonal antibody and a matched isotype control were purchased from Coulter Immunotech. We first determined whether treatment of cells with RA induces activation of PKCδ in the NB-4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, which expresses the t(15;17) translocation. NB-4 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of RA for different times and subsequently lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer. After cell lysis, total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against PKCδ phosphorylated at Thr505. As shown in Fig. 1, RA treatment of NB-4 cells induced strong phosphorylation of PKCδ, which was time-dependent, with the intensity of the signal being strong at 12 h of RA treatment and gradually declining to base-line levels at 48–72 h (Fig. 1A). Stripping and reprobing the same blot demonstrated that equal amounts of PKCδ protein were detectable prior to and after RA treatment, indicating that RA treatment does not affect the levels of PKCδ protein expression (Fig. 1B). Similarly, phosphorylation of the PKCδ protein was inducible by in vitro treatment of primary leukemia cells, isolated from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia with the t(15;17) translocation (Fig. 1C). To directly determine whether the phosphorylation of PKCδ results in induction of its kinase activity, NB-4 cells were treated with RA; cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCδ antibody; and in vitro kinase assays were carried out on the immunoprecipitates using histone H1 as an exogenous substrate. PKCδ immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells treated with RA induced strong phosphorylation of histone H1 in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1D), indicating that the catalytic activity of PKCδ is induced in an RA-dependent manner during its phosphorylation at Thr505. In subsequent studies, we sought to determine whether phosphorylation/activation of PKCδ occurs in other RA-sensitive cell lines. We performed experiments using the HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines, both of which are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of RA (23Yen A. Roberson M.S.

Treatment of HL-60 (Fig. 2, A and B) or MCF-7 (Fig. 2, C and D) cells with RA resulted in strong phosphorylation/activation of PKCδ, indicating that the RA-inducible activation of this serine kinase is not restricted to acute promyelocytic leukemia cells expressing the t(15;17) translocation, but also occurs in other RA-sensitive neoplastic cells. It is well established that retinoids induce their biological effects by regulating gene transcription for proteins that mediate cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and/or apoptosis of target neoplastic cells (15Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 16Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

Such RA-dependent gene transcription is regulated by binding of retinoid·retinoid receptor complexes to RAREs present in the promoters of sensitive genes (15Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 16Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P.

As our data demonstrated that PKCδ was activated during treatment of cells with RA, we sought to determine whether it plays a role in RA-dependent transcriptional regulation. We first examined whether H-7, a nonspecific pan-PKC inhibitor, inhibits RA-dependent gene transcription. We performed experiments in which MCF-7 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing an RARE-luciferase construct and treated with RA in the presence or absence of H-7. As shown in Fig. 3A, H-7 significantly abrogated RA-dependent RARE-mediated luciferase activity, suggesting that PKC activity is required for RA-dependent gene transcription. We subsequently determined whether rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKCδ (25Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 33Uddin S. Sassano A.

Additionally, several chaperones, including GRP94/gp96, have been implicated in stimulating nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages and DC (18Chen W. Syldath U. Bellmann K. Burkart V. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3212-3219PubMed Google Scholar, 20Panjwani N.N. Popova L. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2997-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Importantly, these peptide-independent activities are, under some circumstances, apparently sufficient to account for GRP94/gp96-elicited tumor rejection. For example, prophylactic vaccination of mice with irradiated fibroblasts, engineered to secrete GRP94/gp96 or the GRP94/gp96 N-terminal domain, yielded a marked suppression of 4T1 mammary carcinoma growth and metastasis following tumor cell challenge (15Baker-LePain J.C. Sarzotti M. Fields T.A. Li C.Y. Nicchitta C.V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It thus appears that GRP94/gp96-elicited, peptide-independent APC stimulation can play a prominent, if not primary, role in the phenomenon of chaperone-elicited tumor rejection. Several recent studies have investigated the peptide-independent mechanism(s) by which chaperones stimulate APC, implicating Toll-like receptors (TLR) and CD14 as well as a variety of downstream signaling cascades. TLR generally recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CpG oligonucleotides, and bacterial surface proteins such as flagellin (21Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). Hsp60, for example, elicits TNF-α and NO release from murine macrophages in a TLR4-dependent manner, suggesting that TLR4 serves as a signaling receptor for Hsp60 (22Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). TLR2 and 4 have also been identified as Hsp70 signaling receptors, as determined through ectopic receptor expression studies (23Asea A. Rehli M. Kabingu E. Boch J.A. Bare O. Auron P.E.

Issels R.D. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15107-151112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), and as GRP94/gp96 signaling receptors, based on similar experiments, as well as studies performed on cells derived from TLR4–/– mice (25Vabulas R.M. Braedel S. Hilf N. Singh-Jasuja H. Herter S. Ahmad-Nejad P. Kirschning C.J. da Costa C. Rammensee H.-G. Wagner H. Schild H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20847-20853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). CD14 is a GPI-anchored co-receptor for LPS that may interact with signaling receptors (26Dobrovolskaia M.A. Vogel S.N. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar); work with Hsp70 indicates a CD14 requirement for cytokine release (19Asea A. Kraeft S.-K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Evidence thus suggests that chaperone proteins are recognized by receptors of the innate immune system, principally those involved in the recognition of LPS and other PAMPs, to yield peptide-independent activation of APC function. At least four signaling pathways have been described in the literature for GRP94/gp96-elicited APC activation. First, GRP94/gp96 signaling by activation of NF-κB has been identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (12Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) and by the loss of IκBα by immunoblot (25Vabulas R.M. Braedel S. Hilf N. Singh-Jasuja H. Herter S. Ahmad-Nejad P.

Additionally, MAP kinase phosphorylation has also been observed in response to GRP94/gp96; immunoblotting for phospho-p38, JNK, and ERK demonstrated increases in the phosphorylated (active) form of each, in response to GRP94/gp96 addition (25Vabulas R.M. Braedel S. Hilf N. Singh-Jasuja H. Herter S. Ahmad-Nejad P. Kirschning C.J. da Costa C. Rammensee H.-G. Wagner H. Schild H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20847-20853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). It has been observed that the patterns of APC stimulation by GRP94, Hsp70, and Hsp60 bears many similarities to stimulation by LPS, in their kinetics, signaling pathways, and resulting cellular changes (12Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 22Ohashi K. Burkart V. Flohe S. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 24Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. Ghose S. Kirschning C.J. Issels R.D. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15107-151112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), though significant differences between LPS and GPR94/gp96, with respect to specific cellular effects and kinetics of activation, have been reported (12Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). LPS, which is found on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria, is a problematic contaminant: it is very chemically stable and a potent activator of APC activation (26Dobrovolskaia M.A. Vogel S.N. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and is generally present in protein preparations unless specifically excluded. In fact, LPS levels as low as 15 pg/ml can stimulate some markers of activation in APC, including p38 phosphorylation and IL-6 release (27Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.-P. Cazenave J.-P. Muller S. Haeuw J.-F. Ravanat C. de la Salle H. Hanau D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Several recent reports have revived longstanding concerns about LPS contamination in purified chaperone preparations. The ability of recombinant human Hsp70 to induce TNF-α release from macrophages has recently been attributed to LPS contamination (28Gao B. Tsuan M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Similarly, Bausinger et al. (27Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.-P. Cazenave J.-P. Muller S. Haeuw J.-F. Ravanat C. de la Salle H. Hanau D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) report that recombinant human Hsp70 does not cause DC maturation or cytokine release when endotoxin levels are extremely low (less than 10 EU/mg protein). On a related note, an established GRP94/gp96 purification protocol was recently found to result in substoichiometric contamination of GRP94 by concanavalin A (29Monks S.A. Hassan-Zahraee M. Rottman J.B. Weng J. Wang Y. Sawlivich W. Simha S. Principato J. Carpenter J. Desroches B. Burke J. Truneh A. Srivastava P. Zabrecky J.R. American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. 44. Cadmus Professional Communications, Toronto, Ontario, Canada2003: 2854Google Scholar), raising the possibility that other, heretofore undetected, contaminants may be present in biochemically enriched chaperone preparations. Peptide-independent stimulation of APC appears to be a central event in chaperone-mediated immune tumor rejection. Moreover, despite reports that LPS contamination accounts for some of the APC stimulation attributed to chaperones, it is evident that GRP94/gp96, at least, elicits tumor suppression in the absence of LPS. In systems in which GPR94 is secreted from cultured cells in vivo, suppression of tumor growth and metastasis is significant, peptide independent, and characterized by activation of innate immune mechanisms including DC maturation and NK cell activation (15Baker-LePain J.C. Sarzotti M. Fields T.A. Li C.Y. Nicchitta C.V. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Strbo N. Oizumi S. Sotosek-Tokmadzic V. Podack E.R. Immunity. 2003; 18: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It becomes paramount, then, to understand the mechanism whereby GRP94/gp96 elicits APC activation. For these reasons, we investigated whether LPS was responsible for any of the immunostimulatory activities reported for GRP94/gp96. We also tested CRT, a luminal chaperone with tumor-rejection activity similar to that of GRP94/gp96 (3Nair S. Wearsch P.A. Mitchell D.A. Wassenberg J.J. Gilboa E. Nicchitta C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6426-6432PubMed Google Scholar, 4Basu S. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), whose ability to stimulate an innate immune response has not been characterized. Here, we report that GRP94/gp96 specifically binds LPS, and that low endotoxin preparations of GRP94/gp96 and CRT do not stimulate NF-κB activation or NO release in macrophages; both responses are, however, robustly stimulated by LPS. Low endotoxin GRP94/gp96 and CRT do induce ERK phosphorylation in macrophages, implicating the MAP kinase cascade in the phenomenon of peptide-independent GRP94/gp96- and CRT-elicted APC activation. Materials—LPS levels were determined using the QCL-1000 Limulus amoebocyte lysate kit (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). Escherichia coli LCD25–09 LPS was labeled and purified by the method of Munford et al. (32Munford R.S. DeVaux L.C. Cronan J.E.J. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and was generously provided by Dr. Robert Munford (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Unlabeled LPS is from E. coli strain 026:B6 and was purchased from Sigma. N-[3H]ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) was obtained from Roche Applied Science (Basel, Switzerland). Phosphorothioate CpG oligonucleotide (5′ TCCATCACGTTCCTGACGTT 3′) was the generous gift of Dr. David Pisetsky (Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, NC). PD98059 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Anti-phospho-p38, JNK, and ERK antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). DU-120 is a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a domain in the GRP94 N terminus and was prepared by contract service with Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). A rabbit antiserum against BiP was prepared by contract service with Cocalico Biologicals, using a synthetic peptide representing the 15 N-terminal amino acids of the human protein. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Purification of GRP94/gp96 and Calreticulin—Low endotoxin GRP94/gp96 was purified from porcine pancreas rough microsomes by a modification of the method of Wearsch and Nicchitta (33Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this modification, chromatography buffers were supplemented with detergents, as described below, to yield the efficient removal of LPS. All materials were decontaminated prior to use, either by soaking in 70% EtOH, 0.5 m acetic acid (34Girot P. Moroux Y. Duteil X.P. Nguyen C. Boschetti E. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 510: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), or by baking for 4 h at 200 °C. All buffers were made in pyrogen-free water. Following microsome permeabilization, luminal proteins were loaded on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in TTTE buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 10 mm EDTA). The column was washed sequentially with 400 ml of TTTE, 400 ml of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-114, and 250 ml of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl. A 50–750 mm NaCl gradient was run to elute the column, and gel filtration was performed as usual, except that the column was equilibrated and run in sterile PBS. CRT was purified from porcine pancreas rough microsomes by the method of Wearsch and Nicchitta (33Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and subsequently decontaminated of LPS using polymyxin B-agarose beads, by the method of Wright et al. (35Wright J.R. Zlogar D.F. Taylor J.C. Zlogar T.M. Restrepo C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L650-L658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified CRT was incubated overnight with polymyxin B-agarose beads in a buffer containing 25 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaCl, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm N-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, at 4 °C with mixing. The supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C against several changes of PBS, to exchange buffer and remove traces of N-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. [3H]LPS and [3H]NECA Binding Assays—[3H]LPS binding was determined by incubating 2 μg of GRP94/gp96 with various concentrations of [3H]LPS for 1 h on ice in a final volume of 250 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Bound versus free [3H]LPS was assayed by vacuum filtration of the binding reactions on Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). Vacuum filtration was performed with a vacuum filtration manifold (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were rapidly washed with 3 × 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, placed in 5 ml of scintillation fluid (SafetySolve, RPI, Mt. Prospect, IL), vortexed, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. All binding reactions were performed in triplicate and corrected by subtraction of background values, determined in binding reactions lacking GRP94. [3H]NECA binding assays were performed as in Rosser and Nicchitta (36Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22798-22805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). GRP94/gp96 Fluorescent Labeling and Cell Binding—Low endotoxin GRP94/gp96 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to a ratio of ∼1 mol of FITC:mol GRP94/gp96 dimer. Labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. FITC-GRP94 binding to cells was performed as described in Wassenberg et al. (37Wassenberg J.J. Dezfulian C. Nicchitta C.V. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2167-2175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and evaluated by flow cytometry. Citrate Synthase Aggregation Assay—The effects of low endotoxin GRP94/gp96 on the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase were assayed essentially as described in Buchner et al. (38Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) was preheated to 43 °C. Samples containing no protein, or GRP94 (0.6 μm final), were then added to 400 μl of preheated binding buffer in a quartz microcuvette. The cuvette was placed in a spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Inc., Edison, NJ) thermostatted at 43 °C. Citrate synthase was then added to 0.15 μm final concentration, with stirring. Thermal aggregation of citrate synthase was recorded as light scattering, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 nm and a 1-nm slit width. The time course of citrate synthase aggregation was followed for 1200 s. Readings were taken every 15 s with a 5-s integration. NF-κB Activation Assay—Activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway was determined using the PathDetect NF-κB cis-reporting system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). RAW264.7 cells were plated to 80% confluence in 24-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg each of pLuc-NFκB and pCMV-βGal (as a transfection efficiency control) for 5 h in the presence of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), as per manufacturer's protocols, then cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 21 h. Transfected cells were stimulated with GRP94/gp96, CRT, ConA and/or LPS for 4 h and lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) with a freeze-thaw cycle. Luciferase levels were measured using the Promega luciferase assay system. β-Galactosidase levels were determined by CPRG assay, as in Reed et al. (39Reed R.C. Zheng T. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25082-25089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Luciferase levels were normalized to β-galactosidase levels for analysis. All reactions were performed in triplicate and corrected by subtraction of the luciferase level of transfected, untreated cells. Nitrite Release Assay—Production of nitrite, a measure of nitric oxide release, was determined with the method of Misko et al. (40Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), using 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (Molecular Probes). Fluorometer (Spex Industries, Inc.) slit widths were set to 1 nm for both excitation and emission. Samples were excited at a wavelength of 365 nm and the emission at 450 nm was recorded. All reactions were performed in duplicate and corrected by subtraction of background fluorescence. Determination of MAP Kinase Activation—Peritoneal mouse macrophages were isolated from BALB/c mice by peritoneal lavage with DMEM, 10% FCS, 5–7 days after intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml 4.2% (w/v) brewer's thioglycollate broth. Macrophages were plated in 24-well plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and selected by adherence for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated for 7 h at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM. Cells were supplemented with the indicated concentrations of low endotoxin GRP94/gp96, low endotoxin calreticulin or CpG oligonucleotide in serum-free DMEM for the times indicated. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed in PBS, and lysed on ice in phosphoprotein lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.05% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Cells were removed from the wells with a cell scraper, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. After washing in acetone, protein pellets were resuspended in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-phosphoprotein antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. As an internal loading control, endogenous GRP94/gp96 levels were determined by Western blot using DU120. Quantification was performed with NIH Image 1.63 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). GRP94/gp96 Is an LPS-binding Protein—Current evidence indicates that peptide-independent activation of APC by chaperone proteins plays a fundamental role in the phenomenon of chaperone-elicited antitumor immunity. However, LPS is a common contaminant in purified chaperone preparations, and in the case of Hsp70, recent studies have indicated that contaminating LPS is responsible for all aspects of APC activation tested (27Bausinger H. Lipsker D. Ziylan U. Manie S. Briand J.-P. Cazenave J.-P. Muller S. Haeuw J.-F. Ravanat C. de la Salle H. Hanau D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3708-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Gao B. Tsuan M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine, in the case of GRP94/gp96 and CRT, which aspects of APC activation were chaperone versus LPS-mediated. To distinguish the effects of LPS from those of GRP94/gp96 and CRT on macrophage stimulation, we set out to purify very low endotoxin GRP94/gp96 and CRT. CRT can be decontaminated by incubation with polymyxin B-agarose beads (41Karplus T.E. Ulevitch R.J. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 105: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, we observed that GRP94/gp96 binds polymyxin B beads, making this purification method unsuitable (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, during the gel filtration step of our GRP94 purification (33Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), LPS present in the Mono Q pool eluted in the same fractions as GRP94/gp96 (Fig. 1B). Subsequent attempts to separate GRP94/gp96 from LPS by repeating this gel filtration step demonstrated that LPS continued to coelute with purified GRP94/gp96 (data not shown). These findings, which suggested a GRP94/gp96-LPS association, raised the question of whether GRP94/gp96 specifically binds LPS. LPS-GRP94/gp96 interactions were examined in a radioligand binding assay. In this assay, [3H]LPS and GRP94/gp96 were mixed in solution and the free versus GRP94/gp96-bound [3H]LPS resolved by vacuum filtration. [3H]LPS binding to a control protein, ovalbumin, was negligible; by contrast, we observed significant [3H]LPS binding to GRP94/gp96 (Fig. 1C). The binding was competed by an 50-fold excess of cold LPS, but was un"
https://openalex.org/W2125713429,"The Crim1 gene is predicted to encode a transmembrane protein containing six von Willebrand-like cysteine-rich repeats (CRRs) similar to those in the BMP-binding antagonist Chordin (Chrd). In this study, we verify that CRIM1 is a glycosylated, Type I transmembrane protein and demonstrate that the extracellular CRR-containing domain can also be secreted, presumably via processing at the membrane. We have previously demonstrated Crim1 expression at sites consistent with an interaction with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Here we show that CRIM1 can interact with both BMP4 and BMP7 via the CRR-containing portion of the protein and in so doing acts as an antagonist in three ways. CRIM1 binding of BMP4 and -7 occurs when these proteins are co-expressed within the Golgi compartment of the cell and leads to (i) a reduction in the production and processing of preprotein to mature BMP, (ii) tethering of pre-BMP to the cell surface, and (iii) an effective reduction in the secretion of mature BMP. Functional antagonism was verified by examining the effect of co-expression of CRIM1 and BMP4 on metanephric explant culture. The presence of CRIM1 reduced the effective BMP4 concentration of the media, thereby acting as a BMP4 antagonist. Hence, CRIM1 modulates BMP activity by affecting its processing and delivery to the cell surface.

The TGFβ 1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; CHRD, chordin; CRR, cysteine-rich repeat; GHR, growth hormone receptor; FGFR, fibroblast growth receptor; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; CHRD, chordin; CRR, cysteine-rich repeat; GHR, growth hormone receptor; FGFR, fibroblast growth receptor; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin. superfamily of ligands have prominent roles in nearly all tissues during development. There are over 30 members of this superfamily, including the TGFβ isoforms, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and the closely related growth and differentiation factors, activins, and nodals (reviewed in Ref. 1Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). BMPs, like all members of the TGFβ superfamily, are synthesized as preproteins, which are subsequently cleaved by furin and related subtilisin-like convertases within the Golgi apparatus at a conserved multibasic amino acid motif (Arg-X-X-Arg) to yield a dimeric C-terminal mature domain (2Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Once secreted BMPs bind and facilitate the formation of heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors (1Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). These signal via phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which can translocate into the nucleus and effect gene regulation and expression (reviewed in Ref. 1Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Although TGFβ-1, -2, and -3 are secreted as a member of a large inactive complex containing the latency-associated peptide and a latent TGFβ-binding protein, the BMPs are currently thought to be processed and secreted as active mature molecules and not complexed with a latent TGFβ-binding protein-like molecule. However, like the TGFβs, BMPs do not seem to act over a range of more than one to two cells, suggesting that there is some mechanism of “tethering” (3Jones C.M. Armes N. Smith J.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1468-1475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This limit in signaling range is in part influenced by the prodomain of BMPs (3Jones C.M. Armes N. Smith J.C. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1468-1475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prodomain of the BMPs also influences the efficiency of processing and the stability of the mature BMP (2Constam D.B. Robertson E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 4Dick A. Hild M. Bauer H. Imai Y. Maifeld H. Schier A.F. Talbot W.S. Bouwmeester T. Hammerschmidt M. Development. 2000; 127: 343-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During development, TGFβ superfamily members, and in particular BMPs, specify cell types by forming precisely controlled concentration gradients. The amount of active ligand is regulated via modulation of protein processing, receptor binding, regulation of Smad function, and, as has been discovered recently, extracellular antagonism of BMPs. One of the extracellular BMP antagonists is Chordin (Chrd) and its homologue in Drosophila, short gastrulation (sog) (5Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. Geissert D. Gont L.K. Derobertis E.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 6Francois V. Solloway M. O'Neill J.W. Emery J. Bier E.

Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The Chordin protein (CHRD) is a dorsalizing factor expressed by the organizer in Xenopus, which functions by directly binding BMP4 to inhibit its receptor binding (5Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. Geissert D. Gont L.K. Derobertis E.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 8Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Sog, the functional homologue of Chrd in Drosophila, is expressed ventrally and partly establishes the dorso-ventral body axis by inhibiting the activity of dpp (most closely related to vertebrate BMP2/4) (6Francois V. Solloway M. O'Neill J.W. Emery J. Bier E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2602-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SOG protein can inhibit BMP4 signaling in Xenopus, revealing functional conservation of this interaction between vertebrates and invertebrates (7Schmidt J. Francois V. Bier E. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 4319-4328PubMed Google Scholar). The BMP-antagonizing activity of CHRD and SOG is itself regulated via secreted metalloproteases related to BMP1 (9Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De R.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 10Marques G. Musacchio M. Shimell M.J. Wunnenbergstapleton K. Cho K. Oconnor M.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Xolloid in Xenopus cleaves CHRD, effectively abolishing its ability to antagonize BMP4 (9Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De R.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Tolloid functions in a similar way in Drosophila to cleave SOG (10Marques G. Musacchio M. Shimell M.J. Wunnenbergstapleton K. Cho K. Oconnor M.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). CHRD and SOG proteins are characterized by multiple cysteine-rich repeats, similar to the von Willebrand Factor type C domain (5Sasai Y. Lu B. Steinbeisser H. Geissert D. Gont L.K. Derobertis E.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Such cysteine-rich repeats (CRRs) have a conserved consensus sequence based on ten cysteines (CXnWX 4CX 2CXCX 6CX 4CX 4–6CX 9–11CCPXC). Specific individual CRRs in CHRD can bind directly to BMP4 (11Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a number of novel CRR-containing proteins have been identified, including Neuralin1 (also known as Ventropin) (12Nakayama N. Han C.E. Scully S. Nishinakamura R. He C. Zeni L. Yamane H. Chang D. Yu D. Yokota T. Wen D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 372-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Coffinier C. Tran U. Larrain J. De Robertis E.M. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Sakuta H. Suzuki R. Takahashi H. Kato A. Shintani T. Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Ueno N. Noda M. Science. 2001; 293: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), Drosophila Crossveinless2 (15Conley C.A. Silburn R. Singer M.A. Ralston A. Rohwer-Nutter D. Olson D.J. Gelbart W. Blair S.S. Development. 2000; 127: 3947-3959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Xenopus Kielen (16Matsui M. Mizuseki K. Nakatani J. Nakanishi S. Sasai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5291-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although possessing varying numbers of CRRs, all of these proteins bind to BMPs. CRR motifs in other proteins mediate binding to other members of the TGFβ superfamily. The CRR of procollagen type IIA can interact with TGFβ2 and BMP2 (11Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhu Y. Oganesian A. Keene D.R. Sandell L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has therefore been speculated that this domain has evolved to modulate interactions with TGFβ superfamily members (11Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Connective tissue growth factor contains one CRR and has been shown to antagonize BMP4 by inhibiting receptor binding but acts synergistically with TGFβ1 to enhance receptor binding (18Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Therefore this novel family of proteins appear critical in regulating the activity of TGFβ/BMP signaling in development. The Crim1 gene encodes a protein with six chordin-like CRRs, an N-terminal insulin-like growth factor binding protein-like motif and a putative transmembrane domain (19Kolle G. Georgas K. Holmes G.P. Little M.H. Yamada T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By analogy to other CRR proteins, we have hypothesized that CRIM1 may also function as an antagonist to one or more members of the TGFβ superfamily by direct binding via the CRR repeats (19Kolle G. Georgas K. Holmes G.P. Little M.H. Yamada T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Crim1 shows developmentally regulated expression in the mouse embryo localized to the developing kidney and testis (20Georgas K. Bowles J. Yamada T. Koopman P. Little M.H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the lens of the eye (21Lovicu F.J. Kolle G. Yamada T. Little M.H. McAvoy J.W. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), vibrissae, pinna, tooth primordia, as well as specific regions within the central nervous system (19Kolle G. Georgas K. Holmes G.P. Little M.H. Yamada T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A study of the spatial and temporal expression of Crim1, BMP2, and BMP7 during mouse urogenital development, showed a pattern of overlapping expression for these proteins implying a possible physiological interaction (20Georgas K. Bowles J. Yamada T. Koopman P. Little M.H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we show that CRIM1 interacts with members of the TGFβ family, including BMP4 and BMP7, when co-expressed with these growth factors and that this interaction occurs via the CRR repeat domains. Co-expression of CRIM1 with BMP4 or BMP7 results in a reduction in the processing of pre-BMPs to their mature form and a consequent reduction in the amount of BMP secretion. However, CRIM1 is trafficked with its preprotein ligand to the plasma membrane, whereupon a proportion of the complex remains tethered to the cell surface in an inactive preprotein form. Hence CRIM1 can antagonize members of the TGFβ superfamily. Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors—A full-length human CRIM1 (GenBank™ accession number AF167706) expression construct was created from existing subclones, which covered the entire open reading frame of CRIM1. Intrinsic PmeI and DraII restriction enzyme sites were used for insertion into pCDNA3. An myc (EQKLI-SEEDL) or HA (YPYDVPDY) tag was introduced into CRIM1-Nmyc/HA constructs after residue 78 (Phe) by PCR. CRIM1-E was made by truncating the protein at residue 901, and inserting an myc or HA tag at the C terminus. BMP7preHA was derived from mouse BMP-7 (pMTAD1-BMP7myc, a gift of Dr. Elizabeth Robertson) by inserting the HA epitope after residue 87 (Tyr) as a linker in an intrinsic BsrGI site. Other constructs used in this study were human BMP4 (PMT21-BMP4myc, a gift of Dr. Tom Jessell), chicken Chordin (pMT21-CHRDHA, a gift of Dr. Kevin Lee), and human growth hormone receptor (pcDNA3-GHRHA, a gift of Prof. Michael Waters). Generation of Anti-CRIM1 Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised and purified as described previously (26Little M.H. Wilkinson L. Brown D.L. Piper M. Yamada T. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C486-C495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-NC was raised toward a synthetic peptide: KVCQPGYLNILVSKASGKPGEC (Chiron Technologies). α-CC was raised toward a glutathione S-transferase-conjugated C-terminal epitope of mouse CRIM1 (residues 998–1036; GenBank™ accession number AF168680), which was cloned into pGEX as described previously (26Little M.H. Wilkinson L. Brown D.L. Piper M. Yamada T. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C486-C495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—COS7 cells were transfected when at 50–70% confluence with 1 μg of DNA (or as indicated), in 3 μl of FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). Transfected cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum or OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) for serum-free conditions for 2–3 days. Conditioned media was harvested and concentrated 10× using Amicon Ultra concentraters (Millipore). Cell Fractionation and Western Blotting—CRIM1-Nmyc-transfected COS7 cells were fractionated into light membrane, heavy membrane, and soluble fractions as previously described (22Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting, of fractionated samples, cellular extracts, or media as described below, was performed as described previously (26Little M.H. Wilkinson L. Brown D.L. Piper M. Yamada T. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C486-C495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence of Cells—Immunofluorescence on cell lines using the antibodies indicated was performed as described previously for permeabilized cells (26Little M.H. Wilkinson L. Brown D.L. Piper M. Yamada T. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C486-C495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cell surface binding, antibody incubations were performed on live cells incubated on ice to inhibit internalization. Cells were finally fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Antibody labeling was captured on an Olympus AX70 compound fluorescence microscope. Protein Expression and Glycosylation Assay—For production of CRIM1, CHRD, BMP4, or BMP7 for in vitro binding studies, transiently transfected COS7 cells were incubated in serum-free OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) for 2 days. Conditioned media was concentrated 1:10 and snap-frozen. Conditioned media from transfections using pcDNA3 without insert were used as a control. CRIM1-E protein was expressed by using a stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The protein was purified from conditioned media on an α-myc affinity column. The α-myc produced by the hybridoma 9E10 was cross-linked to protein A-agarose (Sigma) using the method supplied with the cross-linker (Pierce). Protein concentrations were estimated against samples of known concentration by Western blotting. N-Glycosidase S was used to determine N-linked glycosylation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation—For in vitro binding experiments, conditioned concentrated media (see above) were incubated in 200 μl of 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for3hon ice. Cross-linking was performed where indicated using disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation of co-expressed samples, media was used without concentration. Immunoprecipitations were performed by the addition of 5 μl of α-myc antibody and a 2-h incubation at room temperature, followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry, Sigma) and a further 1-h incubation. The beads were pelleted and washed four times with PBS 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with PBS. Protein was eluted by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. For cellular extracts, transfected cells were suspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.5, Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 0.5% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as above, except that beads were pelleted and washed in lysis buffer three times, and twice in PBS. Biotinylation—Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Explant Culture—Embryonic mouse kidneys were dissected at 11.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and grown in culture medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 20 mm glutamine, 5 μg/ml holo-Transferrin as described in a previous study (27Piper M. Georgas K. Yamada T. Little M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium (5 μl) was added where indicated. For immunofluorescence analyses, explants were fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol, 10 min, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Antibody incubations were performed for 1 h at 37 °C in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Primary antibodies used were WT1 (DAKO, 1/100 dilution) and calbindin 28K (Sigma, 1/200 dilution). Secondary antibodies were Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Ureteric tip and nephron number were counted manually, and statistics were performed using InStat3. Due to variability in the age of explants between litters, one-way analysis of variance could only be performed within a given experiment. CRIM1 Is a Type I Transmembrane Protein—Sequence analysis of the CRIM1 open reading frame reveals a C-terminal transmembrane domain, suggesting the large N-terminal CRR-containing domain localizes in the extracellular space (19Kolle G. Georgas K. Holmes G.P. Little M.H. Yamada T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To test this, we designed mammalian expression constructs of human full-length CRIM1, differentially tagged with myc or HA epitope tags (CRIM1-Nmyc/HA). We also produced myc- and HA-tagged constructs with a deletion of the potential transmembrane domain and C-terminal sequence (CRIM1-Emyc/HA) (Fig. 1A). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits to epitopes in the N and C termini of CRIM1 (α-NC and α-CC, respectively) (Fig. 1A). Western blotting with α-myc, α-NC, and α-CC of cellular extracts of COS7 cells transfected with the CRIM1 constructs identified bands of ∼140 kDa for CRIM1-Nmyc and 120 kDa for CRIM1-Emyc (Fig. 1, B and C). CRIM1-E was detected with the α-NC antibody (Fig. 1C), but the α-CC epitope is deleted in this construct. A sequence of LVXLPX-DESK (where X is presumably cysteine) was obtained after N-terminal amino acid sequencing of purified CRIM1-E, which confirms a functional signal peptide sequence with a cleavage site between amino acids Ala-34 and Leu-35. To analyze subcellular localization we fractionated CRIM1-transfected cells to determine if it was localized to membrane fractions. CRIM1 was detected predominantly in the light membrane fraction, which corresponds to the plasma membrane compartment. A smaller concentration was evident in the heavy membrane fraction, which corresponds to intracellular trafficking compartments (Fig. 1D) (22Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine potential plasma membrane localization and orientation, we analyzed CRIM1-Nmyc transfected cells by immunofluorescence. In transfected cells that had been permeabilized by treatment with Triton X-100, there was a strong signal from antibodies to the N-terminal domain (α-myc) and the C-terminal domain (α-CC) (Fig. 1, E and F). Without permeabilization, only the N-terminal domain appeared to be accessible to antibody binding, suggesting the C-terminal was located within the cell (Fig. 1, G and H). In cells transfected with the deletion construct CRIM1-E, no cell surface localization of CRIM1-E was evident (Fig. 1J), yet immunofluorescence of permeabilized cells clearly showed the protein was expressed (Fig. 1I), suggesting that without the transmembrane domain CRIM1 is secreted. Therefore the CRIM1 protein adopts a type I transmembrane conformation with the cysteine-rich N-terminal end localized to the extracellular space (Fig. 1K). CRIM1 Can Be Cleaved to Secrete a Soluble Ectodomain— Because CHRD and other CRR-containing proteins encode secreted molecules, we determined whether a secreted form of CRIM1 exists. Media harvested from COS7 cells transfected with full-length CRIM1 (CRIM1-Nmyc) showed a small amount of CRIM1 in the media (Fig. 1B). The molecular mass of this form was found to be ∼10–15 kDa smaller than from cellular lysates. Although CRIM1-Nmyc from cell lysates was able to be immunoprecipitated by both α-NC and α-CC CRIM1 antibodies, only the α-NC antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the secreted form of CRIM1-Nmyc from the conditioned media (Fig. 1L). These results suggest that CRIM1 is cleaved to release the N-terminal cysteine-rich ectodomain. CRIM1 Is N-Glycosylated—Careful analysis of cell lysates and media from COS7 cells transfected with CRIM1-Emyc suggested a minor molecular weight disparity. To determine if this was due to N-linked glycosylation, we treated CRIM1-Emyc from media with N-glycosidase. This resulted in a molecular mass change of ∼10 kDa suggesting that CRIM1 is N-glycosylated (Fig. 1M). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of CRIM1 suggests that there are five potential N-glycosylation sites (NX(S/T), where X is not P) in the extracellular domain (Fig. 1N). CRIM1 and Members of the TGFβ Superfamily Can Interact—Strong evidence has suggested that CHRD-like CRR proteins bind to members of the TGFβ superfamily, particularly the BMPs (11Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the similarity of CRIM1 CRRs to CHRD, we have focused our analysis on BMP4 (8Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 11Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nakayama N. Han C.E. Scully S. Nishinakamura R. He C. Zeni L. Yamane H. Chang D. Yu D. Yokota T. Wen D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 372-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Sakuta H. Suzuki R. Takahashi H. Kato A. Shintani T. Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Ueno N. Noda M. Science. 2001; 293: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have also investigated the possibility of interaction with BMP7, which shows overlapping sites of expression with CRIM1 in the developing kidney (19Kolle G. Georgas K. Holmes G.P. Little M.H. Yamada T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Georgas K. Bowles J. Yamada T. Koopman P. Little M.H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We first tested whether CRIM1 ectodomain protein harvested in media from cells transfected with CRIM1-EHA or CRIM1-NHA could bind mature BMPs similarly secreted into the media from BMP-transfected cells. After incubation of CRIM1 (5–10 nm) and BMP4 or BMP7 (2–10 nm) at room temperature for 1 h, there was no evidence of binding (Fig. 2A). Under similar binding conditions, CHRD was co-immunoprecipitated together with BMP4, and weakly with BMP7 (Fig. 2A), as previously described (8Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the absence of observable binding was due to a low affinity interaction between CRIM1 and BMP4, chemical cross-linking of the proteins in solution was also performed. Although the presence of cross-linked dimeric BMP4, BMP7, and BMP4·CHRD complexes analyzed under reducing conditions showed that the cross-linking was effective, no binding of CRIM1 to BMP4 was apparent (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the recombinant CRIM1 ectodomain does not bind BMP4 and BMP7 directly in solution. We next determined if CRIM1 could interact with BMPs intracellularly when transiently co-transfected in COS7 cells. CRIM1-NHA was co-immunoprecipitated with BMP4myc and BMP7myc (Fig. 2C). In addition, the unprocessed form of BMP4 (Fig. 2D) was co-immunoprecipitated with CRIM1-NHA. This suggests that full-length CRIM1 can bind to the precursor form of BMP4. Because CRIM1 can be secreted into the media as an ectodomain, we determined if this form was still bound to BMPs. Both CRIM1-EHA and CRIM1-NHA secreted into media were able to be co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc antibody from conditioned media if co-expressed with BMP4myc or BMP7myc (Fig. 2E). CRIM1-Nmyc was only weakly co-immunoprecipitated, but this may be due to the low amount of secreted CRIM1 (Fig. 1A). This suggests that CRIM1 can be secreted into the media as a complex with BMPs. CRIM1 Associates with BMP7 at the Cell Surface—Because CRIM1 associates with BMPs in the cell, we used immunofluorescence analysis on non-permeabilized cells to determine if BMP7myc is tethered to the cell surface when co-expressed with full-length CRIM1 (CRIM1-NHA). When BMP7 is expressed alone, or co-expressed with human growth hormone receptor (GHRHA), there is no BMP7-specific cell surface staining (Fig. 2, F and G). However, when BMP7 was co-expressed with full-length CRIM1, BMP7 was detected on the cell surface (Fig. 2, H and I). To determine whether CRIM1 was interacting with the mature or precursor form of BMP7 at the cell surface, an HA tag was introduced into the N-terminal precursor domain of the BMP7 construct. Co-immunofluorescence was performed on non-permeabilized COS7 cells co-transfected with this construct and CRIM1 using a CRIM1 antibody (α-CN) and α-HA. The results in Fig. 2 (J and K) show that the BMP7 precursor was present on the cell surface of CRIM1-expressing cells. Biotinylation assays were used to investigate the levels of cell-surface pre-BMP7 in the presence and absence of CRIM1. COS7 cells were co-transfected with CRIM1 and BMP7 or empty vector and BMP7. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated and precipitated with streptavidin-agarose. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting and densitometry. Fig. 3 (A and B) show that the CRIM1-producing cells retained a higher percentage of pre-BMP7 on the cell surface than non-expressing cells. To determine whether the tethered pre-BMP7 can be removed from the cell surface, COS7 cells co-transfected with CRIM1 and BMP7 or empty vector and BMP7 were subjected to a 5-min PBS wash followed by a 5-min DTT (20 mm) wash. The washes were concentrated and analyzed for the presence of pre-BMP7 by Western blotting. Fig. 3C shows that a greater amount of pre-BMP7 was washed from the surface of CRIM1-producing cells, with further pre-BMP7 released from the CRIM1-producing cells after DTT treatment. These results are consistent with those of the previous experiment showing that CRIM1-producing cells retain more BMP7 on the cell surface and that the retention involves a conformation reliant on oxidized cysteine residues. The CRR Repeats in CRIM1 Interact with BMP7—To determine whether the CRR repeats are responsible for the interaction of CRIM1 with BMPs, as in CHRD (11Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Development. 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a series of CRIM1 deletion constructs were made (shown schematically in Fig. 3D). These constructs were co-transfected with BMP7 in COS7 cells and the interaction investigated by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3E). The constructs in which one of the two CRR domains were deleted (D2 and D4) interact poorly with BMP7 compared with the full-length CRIM1 and the other deletion constructs. These results suggest that the two blocks of CRR repeats, CRR1–2 and CRR3–6, bind cooperatively to ligand. CRIM1 Inhibits Expression of BMP4 and BMP7—One unexpected observation of CRIM1-BMP co-transfections compared with BMP transfections alone was that the level of expression of the BMP4 or BMP7 was reduced when co-expressed with CRIM1. To confirm that this was a specific effect of CRIM1 expression and not an artifact due to co-expression of two constructs, COS7 cells were co-transfected with BMP7myc or BMP4 myc and equimolar amounts of either CRIM1myc, GHRHA, or CRIM1-D2 myc. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using an α-myc antibody and then stripped and reprobed with the HA antibody to ensure co-expression of GHRHA. The level of BMP7 and BMP4 expression in the lysate was reduced markedly when co-expressed with CRIM1 but not with GHR or with CRIM1 D2 (Fig. 4A). COS7 cells were co-transfected with BMP7 and increasing concentrations (0.5–3 μg) of CRIM1 construct. Analysis of the conditioned media showed that secretion of BMP7 was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentration of CRIM1 (Fig. 4B). CRIM1 Co-localizes with BMP7 Intracellularly—Because CRIM1 appeared to interact with the BMPs intracellularly during processing, it would follow that the two proteins should be trafficked through the same intracellular compartments. Immunofluorescence of permeabilized COS7 cells that had been transfected with either CRIM1HA or BMP7 myc showed co-localization of these proteins with GM130, a Golgi-specific antibody (Fig. 4, C–F). COS7 cells co-transfected with CRIM1HA and BMP7myc showed marked co-localization (Fig. 4, G and H). Taken together our results suggest that CRIM1 interacts with the BMP7 precursor intracellularly, and this interaction results in decreased production of BMPs. The interaction with pre-BMPs appears to be maintained during trafficking of CRIM1 to the cell surface, where pre-BMP7 remains tethered to the cell surface. CRIM1 Antagonizes BMP4 —To examine the functional effect of CRIM1 tethering pre-BMP to the cell surface we used a kidney explant assay. BMP4 is known to retard the development of embryonic mouse kidneys grown in culture in a dose-dependent manner (23Martinez G. Mishina Y. Bertram J.F. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 525-533PubMed Google Scholar). Kidneys were dissected from embryonic mice at 11.5 or 12 dpc and were grown in culture for 3 days. Conditioned media from COS7 cells transfected with empty vector alone, BMP4 plus empty vector, BMP4 plus CRIM1, or BMP4 plus D2 were added to the cultures (Fig. 5, A–D). Kidneys grown in BMP4-conditioned media displayed reduced ureteric tree branching and reduced numbers of comma and S-shaped bodies compared with kidneys grown in control or CRIM1-conditioned media. BMP4 plus CRIM1-conditioned media showed a reduced BMP4 effect (Fig. 5, E and F), whereas BMP4 plus CRIM1 D2-conditioned media showed an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 5F). Hence CRIM1 can ameliorate the effect of BMP4. Removal of CRR1 and -2 decreases the ability of CRIM1 to act in this way. Analysis of the conditioned media by Western blotting and densitometric analysis (Fig. 5, G and H) showed that the media from the CRIM1-expressing cells contained less mature BMP4. These results support our other analyses and suggest that in vivo the effect of CRIM1 on BMP expression and secretion may result in a reduced concentration of active mature BMPs available to the tissues. Proteins containing chordin-like CRRs are an important and growing family of extracellular regulators of the TGFβ superfamily. Most identified to date are secreted diffusible proteins, such as CHRD and SOG, which inhibit BMP function. Unlike CHRD and SOG, we have shown that CRIM1 is an N-glycosylated transmembrane protein predominantly localized to the cell membrane, but that a proportion of CRIM1 can be cleaved and released from the cell membrane as a secreted ectodomain. We also demonstrate that CRIM1 can interact intracellularly with BMP4 or BMP7, supporting the hypothesis that it will act as a mediator of TGFβ superfamily ligand activity, although not defining the specific physiological ligand. Binding of Crim1 appears to affect BMP production in three ways. There is a decrease in the production and processing of preprotein to mature BMP, the secretion of mature BMP is reduced, and a proportion of the BMP released from the cell remains associated with CRIM1, either tethered to the cell surface or as a complex in the media. These represent novel modes of BMP antagonism. We have verified that it is the CRR repeats of CRIM1 that mediate the binding of BMPs, because CRIM1 D2 (CRRs 1 and 2 deleted) and D4 (CRRs 3–6 deleted) interact only weakly with BMP7. CHRD and other CRR-containing proteins bind to the mature, secreted form of BMP via one or more CRR. Unlike these proteins CRIM1 binds to pre-BMPs. However, because the CRR repeats of CRIM1 are necessary for binding, it is likely that interaction is still between the CRRs and the mature domain of the dimeric BMP precursor. The intracellular interaction of CRIM1 and BMPs appears to be specific and not due to an artifact of overexpression. A nonspecific interaction between CRIM1 and BMPs within the cell would suggest the proteins were misfolded. However, the editing machinery within the cell would target the misfolded proteins for degradation within the ER (24Ruddon R.W. Sherman S.A. Bedows E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1443-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CRIM1 and BMP7 are clearly trafficked from the ER through the Golgi and can be secreted. Furthermore, the two CRIM1 deletion constructs D2 and D4 interact with BMP7 only weakly, whereas GHR does not interact with BMP7 at all. That BMP expression is reduced in the presence of CRIM1 also appears to be specific for CRIM1, because it does not occur with CRIM1 D2 or GHR. The apparent role of CRIM1 in the retardation of ligand secretion is not unique. The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR, also called E selectin) is localized both to the Golgi and the cell membrane. Within the cell, FGFR inhibits the secretion of its ligand, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and maintains an intracellular pool of FGF (25Kohl R. Antoine M. Olwin B.B. Dickson C. Kiefer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15741-15748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Co-expression of CRIM1 with BMPs resulted in the reduced production of BMPs. CRIM1 may inhibit processing of pre-BMPs to BMPs and thereby target the pre-BMPs for degradation or, like the FGFR, CRIM1 may sequester pre-BMPs into an intracellular pool that is limited in capacity. Once the pool is full, further expression may be inhibited. Whatever the mechanism may be, the overall effect of CRIM1 co-expression with BMPs is to reduce the amount of active mature BMPs secreted into the media, effectively resulting in antagonism. The function of tethering of BMPs to the cell surface by Crim1 is unclear, as is the role of cleavage of the ectodomain. Tethering by CRIM1 may act to increase the effective half-life of BMPs by facilitating their slow and prolonged release from the surface, may regulate the distance over which BMPs can act, or may deliver BMPs to receptors on the cell surface. Curiously, however, our biotinylation studies suggest that it is the pre-BMP form of BMPs, which are tethered to the cell. CRIM1 cleavage does appear to occur and complexes between BMP and cleaved CRIM1 do exist in the media of co-transfected cells. This might again support the concept of delivery to receptors on another cell, restriction of the distance over which BMPs can act, or regulation of half-life in solution. Repression of secretion, tethering, and binding to the ectodomain may represent different actions tailored for different ligands. Another CRR-containing protein, connective tissue growth factor, has already been shown to bind both TGFβ1 and BMP4, delivering the former to its receptor and therefore acting as a facilitator but antagonizing the binding of the latter, thereby acting as an antagonist (18Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). It is possible that there are multiple roles, both positive and negative, being played by Crim1 depending upon the particular ligand bound. Further studies will be needed to clarify the versatility of Crim1 with respect to TGFβ superfamily ligand binding. However, these studies suggest that Crim1, unlike the CRR-containing proteins previously described, may function by reducing the production and secretion of active BMPs from the cells in which it is expressed. This would provide a novel level of regulation of BMP action during development and beyond. We thank Michael Waters, Tom Jessell, Kevin Lee, and Elizabeth Robertson for expression constructs."

One gene identified by this approach encodes a type I transmembrane receptor that shares sequence homology with the intracellular domain of members of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) receptor family. Real-time quantitative PCR and Northern analyses revealed that this gene is highly expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in several highly vascularized tissues such as kidney, colon, skeletal muscle, heart, and small intestine. In addition, we also found that it is also highly expressed in the ductal epithelial cells of human salivary glands, seminal vesicles, and the collecting tubules of the kidney by in situ hybridization. This putative receptor, which we have termed human SEF (hSEF), is also expressed in a variety of breast cancer tissues. In co-immunoprecipitation assays, this receptor is capable of forming homomeric complexes and can interact with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 1. Overexpression of this receptor inhibits FGF induction of an FGF-responsive reporter gene in human 293T cells. This appears to occur as a result of specific inhibition of p42/p44 ERK in the absence of upstream MEK inhibition. This inhibitory effect is dependent upon a functional intracellular domain since deletion mutants missing the IL-17 receptor-like domain lack this inhibitory effect. These findings are consistent with the recent discovery of the zebrafish homologue, Sef (similar expression to fgf genes), which specifically antagonizes FGF signaling when ectopically expressed in zebrafish or Xenopus laevis embryos. Based on sequence and functional similarities, this novel IL-17 receptor homologue represents a potential human SEF and is likely to play critical roles in endothelial or epithelial functions such as proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.

These newly identified IL-17-like family members (e.g. IL-17B to IL-17F) share ∼20–30% homology with IL-17, have four invariant cysteines, and all contain an amino-terminal putative signal peptide typically required for secretion (12Shi Y.

The most recently described family member, IL-17F, is expressed selectively in activated T cells and monocytes, has been shown to be capable of inhibiting angiogenesis in human endothelial cells (EC), and can induce EC to produce IL-2, transforming growth factor-β, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 cytokines (16Starnes T.

However, the endothelial receptor for IL-17F has remained elusive. ECs play a key role in a variety of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, such as angiogenesis, inflammation, cancer metastasis, and atherosclerosis (17Cines D.B. Pollak E.S. Buck C.A.

We have previously applied a genome-scale strategy to identify all genes expressed in human EC by a combination of large scale EST sequencing and genome-wide microarray expression profiling in human vascular EC cultured under various stimuli (flow, cytokine, angiogenic, etc.) (21Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46364-46373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). One full-length cDNA identified by this approach encoded a potential type I transmembrane protein. The deduced reading frame of this novel gene contains a putative signal peptide followed by a distinct extracellular domain, one membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic domain that shares sequence homology with the intracellular domain of members of the IL-17 receptor (11Moseley T.A. Haudenschild D.R. Rose L. Reddi A.H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In addition to endothelial expression, this novel receptor (termed human SEF (hSEF)) is also found in the ductal epithelial cells of several human tissues by in situ hybridization. This novel receptor is capable of forming a homomeric complex and also interacts with human fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Most interestingly, overexpression of this protein resulted in an attenuation of FGF-mediated induction of a FGF-responsive reporter gene in human 293T cells. This inhibitory effect appears to act downstream (or at the level) of MEK and upstream (or at the level) of ERK. Based on sequence and molecular functions, this novel IL-17 receptor-like protein (hSEF) appears to be a human homologue of a recent discovered zebrafish gene, Sef (similar expression of fgf genes) (22Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Reagents—Human basic FGF was from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against activated-ERK1/2, pan-ERK1/2, activated-MEK1/2, and pan-MEK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody was from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Anti-human FGFR1 monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Full-length Cloning and Expression Plasmids—A full-length clone of human SEF (hSEF) was identified by searching databases (NCBI) for sequences similar to the IL-17 receptor coding region using the BlastX algorithm (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Based on gene prediction and public information (GenBank™ accession number AF458067), the entire open reading frame of hSEF was amplified by PCR via PLATINUM Taq DNA polymerase (BD Biosciences) from a mixture of human umbilical vein endothelial cDNAs and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequence of hSEF was confirmed by sequencing. The following constructs were prepared by cloning of the corresponding PCR fragments into the mammalian expression vectors. The FLAG.hSEF-FL constructs with the predicted mature hSEF (amino acids 28–739), FLAG.hSEF-ΔICD (amino acids 28–353), and FLAG.hSEF-ΔECD (amino acids 284–739) were made using the pFLAG-CMV-1 expression vector (Sigma). The hSEF-FL.Myc (amino acids 28–739) was constructed by PCR in a similar manner into pcDNA4-Myc/His (Invitrogen). Quantitative Real-time PCR (TaqMan) Analysis—hSEF mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR on a panel of cDNAs from a variety of human primary cells or normal tissues. Probes were designed by PrimerExpress software (PE Biosystems) based on the sequence of hSEF gene. Each hSEF gene probe was labeled using 6-carboxyfluorescein, and the β2-microglobulin reference probe was labeled with a different fluorescent dye (VIC™, ABI, Foster City, CA). The differential labeling of the target gene and internal reference gene thus enabled measurement in the same well. Normalization was performed using β2-microglobulin mRNA levels as controls in the same reaction. TaqMan experiments were carried out on an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycler conditions were as follows: hold for 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by two-step PCR for 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s followed by 60 °C for 1 min. Northern Blot Analysis—The human tissue Northern blot was purchased from Clontech and hybridized with a radiolabeled human SEF cDNA probe (nucleotides 206–633) per the manufacturer's protocol. Construction of FGF-responsive Reporter Gene—The FGF-inducible response element (FiRE) of the mouse syndecan-1 gene was defined as described previously (25Jaakkola P. Vihinen T. Maatta A. Jalkanen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3210-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The FiRE fragment amplified from mouse genomic DNA was confirmed by sequencing and cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3 (Promega). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates overnight before transfection. The transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). We constantly observed greater than 90% of transfection efficiency in 293T cells, accessed by the transfection of green fluorescent protein vector (Clontech) as reporter and examined by flow cytometry. The total amount of DNA was kept constant in all transfections by supplementing empty vector DNA. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured as previously described (26DiChiara M.R.

Luciferase Reporter Assay—293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmids together with 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-FiRE and 0.05 μg of the Renilla luciferase reporter vector as an internal control (27Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). After serum-free conditions for 20 h, cells were treated with bFGF (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured by using reagents from Promega and was expressed as relative luciferase activity by dividing firefly luciferase by that of Renilla luciferase. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 15 min on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Cells lysates were incubated with 1 μg of the indicated antibody and 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-agarose (Pierce) for 2 h with gentle rocking. After three washes with lysis buffer, precipitated complexes were solubilized by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% gelatin and 0.05% Tween 20 and were blotted with the indicated antibodies. After two washes, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. After washing the membranes, the reactive bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Tissue Samples—Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of normal human tissues, breast tumor tissues, and breast carcinoma cell lines were obtained from DAKO Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). The breast cancer tissue samples were either individual samples or were represented in tissue microarray slides. Altogether the various tissue samples analyzed are from more than 50 individuals. In Situ Hybridization—The details of tissue preparation and in situ hybridization have been described earlier (28Komuves L.G. Hanley K. Lefebvre A.M. Man M.Q. Ng D.C. Bikle D.D. Williams M.L.

Following the manufacturer's protocol, digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes were synthesized from hSEF cDNA templates (nucleotides 206–633) using reagents supplied by Roche Applied Science. Sectioning, pretreatment of the sections, and hybridization of the probes were done under strict RNase-free conditions. All reagents were prepared using diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled water. Sections of 15-μm-thick were collected on positively charged slides and dried at 55 °C overnight. The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated in Histosolve (ThermoShandon, Pittsburgh, PA) and ethanol, and rinsed in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled water. The sections were treated at room temperature with 0.2 n HCl (20 min), 1.5% H2O2 (15 min), 0.3% Triton X-100 (15 min) followed by proteinase K treatment at 37 °C (30 min). The sections then were washed with triethanolamine buffer followed by acetylation with acetic anhydride. After prehybridization in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) containing 50% formamide at 37 °C (1 h), the sections were air-dried at room temperature. Sections were hybridized with the probes diluted in hybridization solution (2× SSC, containing 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's, 0.001% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.005% sodium pyrophosphate, and 500 μg/ml yeast tRNA) at 55 °C overnight. After hybridization, the sections were washed with 4× SSC (2 × 15 min) and 2× SSC (2 × 15 min). The sections then were treated with RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min followed by washes in 2× SSC at 37 °C (15 min), 0.1× SSC at 42 °C (40 min), and finally in 0.1× SSC at room temperature (2 × 15 min). The sections were washed with maleate buffer (30 min) and then blocked with 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 500 mm NaCl, 4% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% cold-water fish skin gelatin, and 0.05% Tween 20. The sections were then incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h. The signal was amplified using TSA-Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the signal was detected with Vector Blue substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After incubation with substrate, the sections were dehydrated in ethanol and Histosolve and coverslipped. Hybridization with the sense control probe did not result in detectable signal, indicating the specificity of hybridization. Microscopy—Slides were observed with an Olympus BX50 microscope (Olympus US, Inc., Melville, NY), using differential interference contrast illumination. The microscope was equipped with a NIKON DXM1200 digital camera (Technical Instruments San Francisco, Burlingame, CA). Digitized images (1280 × 1024-pixel resolution) were acquired using ACT-1 software (Nikon USA, Melville, NY). Images were resized, cropped and assembled using Photoshop version 6.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Apart from equalizing the background intensities, no other digital modifications of the original digital images were carried out. Identification and Full-length Cloning of hSEF—We have previously utilized a combination of high throughput sequencing and genome-wide microarray profiling analyses to identify novel cell-surface proteins expressed in HUVEC (21Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Colman S.D. Shenoy S. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Tomlinson J.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46364-46373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). One cDNA identified by this approach encodes a protein sequence homologous to the cytoplasmic domain of human IL-17R. To obtain the full-length cDNA of this gene, the original cDNA fragment was mapped to human genomic sequence (www.ensembl.org) and was found to be localized on chromosome 3p14.3, where a human gene was predicted based on its homology to zebrafish and mouse Sef (similar expression of fgf genes) (22Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Multiple oligonucleotides, based on the public sequence, were used to amplify the entire open reading frame from a mixture of HUVEC cDNAs. This cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2217 nucleotides and encodes a polypeptide of 739 amino acids (Fig. 1a). Hydropathy (31Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) and protein family (32Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Durbin R. Proteins. 1997; 28: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) analyses predict one 27-residue amino-terminal signal peptide (SP) followed by a 272-residue extracellular domain (ECD), one 20-amino acid membrane-spanning (TM) domain, and a 420-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (ICD) (Fig. 1b). The ECD contains seven potential sites for N-linked glycosylation and shares apparent homology with mouse and zebrafish (mSef and zSef) (22Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) but is otherwise distinct to all other proteins in the data base. Interestingly, the ICD is highly homologous to that of mSef and zSef, and the sequence similarity extends to the ICD of other members of the IL-17R family (15–20% identical) as well (11Moseley T.A. Haudenschild D.R. Rose L. Reddi A.H. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that eight cysteine residues are invariant among the ECD of human, mouse, and zebrafish SEF homologues, suggesting that these residues probably play a critical role in maintaining the secondary structure and/or functions of SEF. Cell Type and Tissue Distribution of hSEF Transcript—To validate the EC origin of this novel receptor, hSEF expression was measured by real-time quantitative PCR (TaqMan) in a cDNA panel derived from a variety of human primary cells and tissues (Fig. 2a). We found that hSEF is highly enriched in cultured HUVEC but found low or no expression in human primary coronary smooth muscle cells, peripheral blood leukocytes, macrophages, CD34+ progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, neutrophils, or erythroids (Fig. 2a , top panel). Interestingly, when a panel of human tissues was assessed for hSEF expression by TaqMan, hSEF mRNA was expressed in a variety of normal human tissues with highest levels in ovary and breast (Fig. 2a , bottom panel). This expression pattern suggests that hSEF may also be expressed in epithelial cells. To further validate this tissue distribution, a Northern blot containing poly(A)-enriched mRNA (1 μg) from a variety of human adult tissue was hybridized with a hSEF cDNA radiolabeled probe. The expression level of the hSEF transcripts was highest in kidney followed by heart, skeletal muscle, colon, and small intestine and barely detectable in brain, spleen, liver, placenta, and lung (Fig. 2b), which is broadly consistent with the TaqMan analysis (Fig. 2a , bottom panel). Expression of hSEF in several highly vascularized tissues, such as kidney or heart, is consistent with the endothelial origin of hSEF; however, we were unable to confirm the EC expression pattern by in situ hybridization. It is possible that the mRNA expression level in tissue ECs is below the sensitivity limit of in situ hybridization method we used. High expression levels of hSEF in human breast prompted us to further examine a variety of epithelial-rich normal and tumor tissues. Intriguingly, we observed that hSEF mRNA expression was localized to ductal epithelial cells in human salivary gland, seminal vesicle, and the collecting tubules of the kidney by in situ hybridization (Fig. 3). hSEF message is uniformly expressed in normal epithelial cells in the intercalated ducts of the salivary glands (both in the parotid and submandibular glands) (Fig. 3a) and the collecting ducts in kidney (Fig. 3c). In the seminal vesicle, hSEF is expressed in scattered solitary cells in the connective tissue stroma and in the epithelium (Fig. 3b). The precise identity of those cells is currently unknown. hSEF Expression in Human Breast Tumors and Breast Carcinoma Cell Lines—We also examined hSEF expression in a number of breast tumor samples with different pathologies by in situ hybridization. As shown in Fig. 4, samples of well differentiated ductal carcinomas of the breast expressed hSEF uniformly in the epithelial cells, whereas the connective tissue stroma was negative in all cases (Fig. 4, a and b). Less differentiated forms of ductal carcinomas expressed hSEF at varying levels (Fig. 4c); several of those cases were negative (data not shown). Variable, non-uniform expression of hSEF was found in other types of breast tumors analyzed, such as fibroadenoma, cribriform carcinoma, and mucus adenocarcinoma (data not shown). hSEF expression was also studied in three human breast carcinoma cell lines (DAKO HercepTest). These cell lines express the HER-2/neu receptor at various levels scored at 3+ (SKBR-3), 1+ (MDA-175), and 0 (MDA-231) (33Brown R.E. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 32: 12-21PubMed Google Scholar). hSEF expression, which showed high cell-to-cell variations, correlates well with HER-2/neu oncogene expression in these breast carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 4, d–f). That is, MDA-231 (grade 0, no expression of HER-2/neu) has the weakest hSEF expression (Fig. 4d), whereas SKBR-3 (grade +3 for high expression of HER-2/neu) has the strongest hSEF expression (Fig. 4f). MDA-175 (grade +1 for intermediate expression of HER-2/neu) displayed moderate hSEF expression as compared with SKBR-3 cells (Fig. 4e). Taken together these expression studies indicate that hSEF is expressed in certain epithelial cell type in vivo and may play a role in the pathology of certain tumors of epithelial origin. In addition, reproducible evidence of hSEF expression is seen in primary cultured human endothelial cells. hSEF Is Capable of Forming a Homomeric Complex and Interacts with FGFR1—To elucidate the functions of hSEF, several epitope-tagged expression plasmids were constructed to produce the full-length (FL), ICD-truncated (ΔICD), or ECD-truncated (ΔECD) version of hSEF (Fig. 1b). The FLAG epitope was added at the amino terminus followed by signal peptide cleavage site, whereas the Myc tag was joined at the carboxyl terminus for the detection of the recombinant protein expression. We first examined whether or not hSEF, behaving like a putative receptor, could be expressed and targeted to the cell surface. The FLAG.hSEF-FL, ΔICD, or ΔECD proteins were expressed by means of transient expression in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were collected and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, then analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that expression of all three forms of recombinant hSEF proteins resulted in a shift of a population of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown), suggesting that hSEF indeed behaves like a receptor and is targeted to the cell surface. Because families of cytokine receptors or growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases are often capable of forming dimeric or higher ordered structures (34Davies D.R. Wlodawer A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Sun P.D. Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 269-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because hSEF is an apparent receptor, we hypothesized that oligomeric forms of hSEF may exist. The differential epitope-tagged versions of hSEF were singly or co-transfected in 293T cells, and we then examined their association by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 5a). Lysates of these cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with"

The level of MMP-2 expression was not altered by serum withdrawal, suggesting that MMP-2 expression is regulated by a series of steady-state conditions that impinge on the MMP-2 promoter. Expression of a dominant-negative Ras protein significantly inhibited MMP-2 transcription, thereby suggesting a role for steady-state Ras function in the regulation of MMP-2 expression. Kirsten-Ras (K-Ras) knockout fibroblasts express undetectable basal levels of MMP-2, whereas N-Ras knockout fibroblasts expressed constitutive levels of MMP-2 similar to those observed in wild-type control fibroblasts. Using an MMP-2 promoter-luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that the transcription of MMP-2 in K-Ras knockout fibroblasts was partially restored by transient expression of c-K(B)-Ras but not c-K(A)-Ras. A phosphoinositide-3 (PI-3) kinase-specific inhibitor (LY294002) decreased the basal level of MMP-2 in wild-type fibroblasts. Blocking PI-3 kinase signaling by overexpression of the regulatory domain of PI-3 kinase (p85) also down-regulated the steady-state MMP-2 levels. Fibroblasts that fail to express AKT1 also expressed decreased amounts of MMP-2 compared with wild-type fibroblasts. These data suggest that steady-state MMP-2 expression is regulated by c-K(B)-Ras through a PI-3 kinase:AKT-dependent signaling pathway. Because the majority of the MMP-2 assays were performed using conditioned media from serum-starved fibroblasts, these data also highlight our previous observations that Ras proteins have functions in the absence of acute mitogenic stimulations. In addition, this is the first demonstration of a specific steady-state function attributable to K(B)-Ras.

MMP-2 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PI-3, phosphoinositide-3; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast. belongs to an evolutionarily conserved proteinase family that requires Zn2+ for enzymatic activity. MMP-2 is synthesized and secreted as inactive zymogen. The activation of MMP-2 requires the removal of prodomain by the membrane-type MMPs. The activity of MMP-2 is tightly regulated by its natural inhibitor TIMP2 (1Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3239) Google Scholar, 2Curran S. Murray G.I. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 3Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). The expression of MMP-2 is tissue and developmentally regulated. MMP-2 is expressed in the developing murine lung and kidney, with minimum expression in bone and the central nervous system. In the adult animal, MMP-2 is minimally expressed, primarily confined to cells of mesangial origin (4Reponen P. Sahlberg C. Huhtala P. Hurskainen T. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7856-7862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of MMP-2 is relatively constitutive. Sequence analysis revealed that the transcription of MMP-2 is under control of a number of cis-acting regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking region, including P53, Y-box, AP2, AP-1, ETS, C/EBP, CREB, PEA3, and Sp1 (5Qin H.

The high specific activity of MMP-2 toward collagen and its pericellular localization imply that it is a key component in the degradation of basement membranes and cell migration (1Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z.

The most common forms of oncogenic Ras have mutations at either codon 12, 13, or 61 (18Bos J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations result in a higher proportion of Ras proteins with GTP in their binding site. Introduction of oncogenic H-Ras into fibroblasts results in increased expression of MMP-2 (14Giunciuglio D. Culty M. Fassina G. Masiello L. Melchiori A. Paglialunga G. Arand G. Ciardiello F.

Three genes encode the four immediate members of the Ras family: H-, N-, K(A)-, and K(B)-Ras. K(A)- and K(B)-Ras proteins arise from alternative splicing of the K-Ras mRNA (20Shields J.M. Pruitt K.

We have generally found c-Ha-Ras protein expression to be detectable only in cells of neuronal origin, whereas c-N-Ras and both K-Ras isoforms are expressed in all tested cell lines. Recent data suggest that different Ras isoforms possess distinct cellular functions. The most compelling evidence is that both the H-Ras knockout and the N-Ras knockout mice are viable, whereas the K-Ras knockout is embryonic lethal. The loss of two K-Ras proteins was not mimicked by the Ha-, N-Ras double knockout mice, which, similar to the single knockouts, were viable (22Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E.

The N-Ras and K-Ras knockout fibroblasts provide excellent tools to study the role the K- and N-Ras isoforms in regulating the expression of MMP-2. Reagents—Gelatin was obtained from Sigma. MMP-2 cDNA probe was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. PD098059, SB203580, LY294002, genistein, PD153035, and the AKT-specific inhibitor were obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies—MMP-2 (Ab-3) was obtained from Oncogene. Anti-HSP90 monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-AKT1 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. The polyclonal antibody against K(B)-Ras, P85, and the monoclonal antibodies against N-Ras and Ha-Ras were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotchnology, Inc. Cell Culture—All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. For the preparation of conditioned medium for zymography, cells (at ∼80% confluence) were washed three times with serum-free medium. Cells were then cultured for an additional 18 h in serum-free medium before collection of the conditioned medium for MMP assays. When using pharmacological inhibitors, cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of the inhibitor, washed, and then placed in serum-free medium containing the same concentration of the specific inhibitor for an additional 18 h. Preparation of Cell Lysates—All lysis buffers contained the following phosphatase and protease inhibitors: 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm phosphoserine, 1 mm phosphothreonine, 0.2 mm phosphotyrosine, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 25 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in p21 buffer (20 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) containing 1% CHAPS (United States Biochemical Corp.). The cells were lysed for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant solution was retained for further experiments. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Zymography of MMP in Conditioned Medium—Conditioned, serum-free medium was prepared as described above. The medium was centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove cellular debris. The amount of conditioned medium was normalized to the amount of protein in the corresponding parallel cell lysates (prepared as described above). Non-reducing sample buffer was added to the appropriate amount of conditioned medium and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using gels made with 1 mg/ml gelatin in the separating gel. The gels were electrophoresed at 25 mA until the bromphenol blue dye front reached the bottom. The gels were rinsed three times for 10 min each with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 2% Triton X-100 followed by three washes (5 min each) with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The gels were then incubated overnight at 37 °C in developing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, and 5 mm CaCl2). The next day, the gels were rinsed and stained with 0.2% Coomassie blue in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 1 h. Finally, the gels were destained in 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid. MMP activity was observed by the generation of a negative clear band in the blue-gelatin staining background. The gels were quantitated using a Microtek scanner and NIH Image software version 1.60b7 and normalized with respect to untreated controls. Reverse Transcription-PCR—1 μg of total RNA from K+C, K+13, K-2B, and K-6 were used for reverse transcription with Roche TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (poly-dT primer). Reverse transcription was performed at 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min. PCR were performed with Roche High-Fi polymerase. The denature temperature was 94 °C, annealing temperature was 60 °C, and elongation temperature was 72 °C. The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Sigma. The sequences of primers were: atg gag gca cga gtg gcc tg (MMP-2 sense primer), tca gca gcc cag cca gtc tg (MMP-2 antisense primer), tcg gcg tgaa cgg att tgg ccg ta (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense primer), and tgg cat gga ccg tgg tca tga gtc (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense primer). Immunoblotting—Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with blocker casein in phosphate-buffered saline (Pierce Chemical Co.) containing 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). The washed blots were incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000) for 2 to 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20, the blots were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the signals were detected using standard enhanced chemiluminescence techniques. The signals were quantitated using a Microtek scanner and NIH Image software version 1.60b7 and normalized to untreated controls. Luciferase Reporter Assay—1 × 105 cells per well were seeded into 12-well dishes. The MMP-2 promoter luciferase reporter and pRL-CMV were transiently introduced into fibroblasts in combination with other indicated constructs using LipofectAMINE/Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). The amount of total DNA was kept constant using the appropriate empty vectors. The luciferase activity of the MMP-2 reporter was analyzed with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and normalized to the activity of the Renilla reniformis luciferase. The basal level of luciferase activity was analyzed by transfection with pGL2-Basic plasmid and pRL-CMV. The relative luciferase activity is reported as the fold increase of the MMP-2 reporter luciferase activity compared with the basal level of luciferase activity. Steady-state Expression of MMP-2 in Mouse Fibroblasts—We first tested whether the production of MMP-2 maintains its tissue specificity in cultured cells. Conditioned medium from each cell line was analyzed either by gelatin zymography (Fig. 1A, top) or by immunoblotting the conditioned media for MMP-2 (Fig. 1A, bottom). Both murine fibroblast cell lines, NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2, secrete easily detectable amounts of MMP-2. Epithelial cells (IEC-6 and COS-7), however, did not secrete detectable levels of MMP-2 (Fig. 1A). We next tested whether the generation of MMP-2 was a constitutive, steady-state phenomenon or might be regulated through short-term signal transduction mechanisms. In Fig. 1B, the expression of MMP-2 activity in conditioned medium was monitored through a serum-deprivation time course. Cells were serum-starved for a 24-hour period. After this initial starvation period, cells were incubated with fresh serum-free medium. Aliquots of this medium were taken every 6 h and analyzed for the presence of MMP-2 by zymography. The data suggest that MMP-2 production continue at a linear rate (Fig. 1B, right), even after this prolonged period of serum withdrawal. These data suggest that the generation of MMP-2 in the extracellular medium is not regulated through a serum-dependent mechanism. The converse experiment, examining whether MMP-2 expression was altered upon serum addition, confirmed the steady-state nature of MMP-2 expression (Fig. 1C). Challenging quiescent cultures with serum did not induce any further expression or secretion of MMP-2. Interestingly, however, we did observe a reproducible increase in MMP-9 activity 24 h after serum addition. These data suggest that MMP-2 expression and secretion are regulated through a steady-state mechanism, rather than an inducible mechanism that might be dependent on acute signal transduction. K-Ras Knockout Fibroblasts Fail to Secrete MMP-2—The constitutive production of MMP-2 by mouse fibroblasts allowed us to use N-Ras and K-Ras negative cell lines to examine the role of each Ras isoform in the maintenance of MMP-2 synthesis and secretion. To avoid potential artifacts arising from cell line divergence, we generated multiple immortalized cell lines from the K-Ras knockout and control MEF populations. These are represented by K-1C, K-2B, K-3, K-4, and K-6 for the K-Ras negative cell lines and K+C, K+2, K+13, and K+14 for the control cell lines. N–/– and N+/+ indicate, for these experiments, a single N-Ras negative and control immortalized fibroblast population. We verified, by immunoblotting, the presence and absence of the different Ras isoforms in this spectrum of cell lines (Fig. 2A). As expected, the K-Ras negative cell lines fail to express K(B)-Ras and K(A)-Ras, whereas the N-Ras negative cells express both K(B) and K(A)-Ras but not N-Ras. There was no significant difference in the level of c-N-Ras expressed by the control K-Ras-expressing cells and the K-Ras negative cells (expressing 9 ng of c-N-Ras per 30 μg of cell lysate). Consistent with our previous experience using mouse fibroblasts, c-Ha-Ras was not detected. In this case, a lysate generated from C3H10T1/2 cells transformed by the minimal expression of an oncogenic G12V-Ha-Ras (11A) and PC12 cell lysate were used as positive controls for Ha-Ras expression. As has been our experience with cultured cell lines, c-Ha-Ras is only detectable in cell lines of neuronal origin (with a 2-ng sensitivity). The five K-Ras negative fibroblast cell lines did not possess detectable MMP-2 activity. In contrast, all the wild-type, control fibroblast cell lines expressed MMP-2 activity comparable with that of other mouse fibroblast cell lines (Fig. 2B, top). Both N-Ras knockout and wild-type, N+/+, control fibroblasts expressed levels of MMP-2 activity consistent with that observed for both the NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 cell lines. These data were confirmed by Western analysis of the conditioned media (Fig. 2B, bottom). These data indicate that the steady-state level of MMP-2 in mouse fibroblasts requires the function(s) of a c-K-Ras gene product rather than that of c-N-Ras. The failure to detect c-Ha-Ras protein in any of these cell lines rules out its involvement in the regulation of steady-state MMP-2 expression. K-Ras Regulates MMP-2 Levels through a Transcriptional Mechanism—We first tested whether the K-Ras negative cells were producing MMP-2 but failing to secrete the protein into the extracellular milieu. Similar to our observations with conditioned medium, whole-cell extracts generated from the K-Ras knockout fibroblasts possessed significantly less (an 85% decrease) MMP-2 protein compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). MMP-2 mRNA, as detected by reverse transcription-PCR analysis, suggested that K-Ras regulated the steady-state transcription of the MMP-2 gene (Fig. 3B). In contrast, there was a lack of MMP-2 mRNA amplification in the K-Ras negative cell lines suggesting the absence of MMP-2 mRNA. The 519-bp glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment was amplified in all samples as a loading control. Similar results were obtained by Northern analysis in that we did not detect significant levels of MMP-2 mRNA in the K-Ras-negative cell lines. MMP-2 mRNA was detected in both K+/+ cell lines and the positive control, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma transformed by an activated N-Ras allele (data not shown). We confirmed this observation using a transient, luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 3C). MMP-2 transcription levels from K-Ras knockout and wild-type fibroblasts were measured by transfection of a rat MMP-2 promoter luciferase reporter construct and pRL-CMV. The luciferase activity of the MMP-2 reporter construct was analyzed with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and normalized to the activity of R. reniformis luciferase. The relative luciferase activity indicates the fold increase of MMP-2 reporter luciferase activity related to the basal level luciferase activity. Only minimal reporter activity was detected in the K-Ras negative cell lines, whereas 10–30-fold higher reporter activity was detected in the K-Ras-expressing control fibroblasts. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that K-Ras function is required for the transcription of the MMP-2 gene. Ras Signaling Is Required for Transcription of MMP-2—To explore the possible role of Ras signaling in the regulation of steady-state MMP-2 expression, a dominant-negative Ha-Ras-N17 vector was co-transfected with the previously described Rat MMP-2 promoter luciferase reporter construct. Ras-N-17 blocks Ras activity be tying up Ras exchange factors into a non-productive cycle (32Schweighoffer F. Cai H. Chevallier-Multon M.C. Fath I. Cooper G. Tocque B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity of the MMP-2 reporter construct was analyzed as described in Fig. 3C. Expression of the dominant-negative Ha-Ras-N17 inhibited MMP-2 promoter activity by ∼80% in the K-Ras-expressing control fibroblasts (Fig. 4A). We next used expression plasmids encoding the separate K-Ras isoforms in an attempt to modulate MMP-2 reporter activity (Fig. 4B). Only c-K(B)-Ras restored MMP-2 reporter activity in the transient transfection assay described in Fig. 4A (p < 0.05). In this instance, we used phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate addition as a positive control. In separate experiments, we found that phorbol ester addition increased the basal expression of MMP-2 protein by 2-fold (data not shown). Therefore, the level of transcriptional activation by K(B)-Ras, though only 50% above the vector control, is consistent with the level of transcriptional activation by the positive control. Combining both K(A)- and K(B)-Ras encoding plasmids did not give rise to a synergistic activation of MMP-2 luciferase activity. These results suggest that constitutive expression of MMP-2 is controlled through the function(s) of only c-K(B)-Ras and not c-K(A) or c-N-Ras. PI-3 Kinase/AKT Signaling Pathway Is Required for the Steady-state MMP-2 Expression in Fibroblasts—Ras proteins are key molecular switches that mediate transmembrane signaling through the activation of multiple downstream pathways, which include the MAPK and PI-3 kinase pathways (33Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). A series of pharmacological inhibitors were used to test the potential contribution of one or more Ras-dependent signaling pathways that might regulate the steady-state transcription of the MMP-2 gene. Secretion of MMP-2 into the medium of K-Ras-expressing control fibroblasts was analyzed by immunoblotting for MMP-2 after a 48-h treatment with one of the following signaling inhibitors: PD098059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-specific inhibitor, 37 μm), SB203580 (p38-specific inhibitor, 10 μm), LY294002 (PI-3 kinase-specific inhibitor, 20 μm), genistein (tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 100 μm) or PD153035 (epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 10 μm). LY294002 treatment dramatically inhibited the secretion of MMP-2 in wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). There was also a less pronounced, but reproducible, effect using the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Others have also reported the inhibition of MMP-2 expression by genistein (34Alhasan S.A. Aranha O. Sarkar F.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4174-4181PubMed Google Scholar). The PI-3 kinase-dependent, constitutive expression of MMP-2 was mimicked upon examination of the protein levels in whole-cell lysates (Fig. 5B). The specific PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 was effective in blocking the steady-state accumulation of MMP-2 in whole-cell lysates, again suggesting that the expression of MMP-2 is regulated through a K-Ras-dependent pathway that flows through PI-3 kinase. We used overexpression of the regulatory p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase as a dominant negative to block basal signaling through receptor-mediated tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of the p85 regulatory subunit inhibited MMP-2 promoter activity in both K-Ras-expressing control cell lines (Fig. 5C). The K+C control cell line was more susceptible to this inhibition, which is consistent with this cell line's increased sensitivity of MMP-2 promoter activity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (Fig. 5B). These data all support the hypothesis that constitutive MMP-2 expression is regulated through a steady-state signaling event passing through c-K(B)-Ras and PI-3 kinase. The lipid products of PI-3 kinase activity result in the activation of a downstream serine kinase, AKT. Using a similar strategy, we examined the levels of MMP-2 secretion in cells that were wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous knockouts for AKT1. In complete agreement with our previous observations and the documented relationship between PI-3 kinase lipid products and AKT activation, there was a significant decrease in constitutive MMP-2 expression in the AKT1-negative MEF populations (Fig. 6A, top). It is interesting that the decreased MMP-2 expression was similar between the AKT1+/– and the AKT1–/– MEFs, suggesting a possible threshold effect for AKT expression. We have observed a similar phenomenon in N-Ras heterozygous MEFs in their heightened response to apoptotic agents; N-Ras+/– cells responded in a manner more similar to the N–/– cells than the N+/+ cells. 2J. C. Wolfman and A. Wolfman, unpublished observations. Western analysis of AKT1 verified that the AKT1+/– cells expressed AKT1 at about 50% of the level observed in the AKT1+/+ MEFS. To verify the threshold nature of the MMP-2 expression of AKT levels, we quantitated the amount of AKT in the different MEF populations (Fig. 6A, bottom). To confirm the role of AKT signaling in mediating MMP-2 expression, we used an AKT-specific inhibitor (20 μm) to block AKT-dependent gene expression in control K-Ras-expressing fibroblasts. Similar reductions in the steady-state levels of MMP-2 in whole-cell lysates were observed in the presence of either the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 or the specific AKT inhibitor (Fig. 6B). These data support the hypothesis that constitutive MMP-2 expression is regulated through the steady-state functions of c-K(B)-Ras, PI-3 kinase and AKT. The data presented in this manuscript support the newly established consensus that the different immediate Ras isoforms do not have completely overlapping functions (20Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 21Ellis C.A. Clark G. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Several groups have shown that the Ras isoforms possess different potencies in their respective abilities to activate Raf-1 and PI-3 kinase (27Voice J.K. Klemke R.L. Le A. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17164-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). We have also shown, in mouse fibroblasts, that plasma membrane associated c-N-Ras is the preferential binding partner for Raf-1 (29Hamilton M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1417-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Hamilton M. Liao J. Cathcart M.K. Wolfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29079-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here, using immortalized N-Ras and K-Ras knockout fibroblasts, we have shown that, in the absence of short-term mitogenic stimulation, the expression of MMP-2 is regulated through a c-K(B)-Ras dependent process. Every K-Ras-negative cell line tested was devoid of MMP-2 secretion, whereas the N-Ras-negative cells expressed levels of MMP-2 consistent with that observed in control fibroblasts. The decreased expression of MMP-2 in K-Ras-negative cells was mimicked by incubation of control cells with either a PI-3 kinase or AKT inhibitor, by expression of a dominant-negative PI-3 kinase, or by the failure to express AKT-1, suggesting the involvement of these signaling intermediates in the regulation of MMP-2 levels. Indeed, cells failing to express AKT1 were also deficient in the expression of MMP-2. The data presented in this manuscript are the first to document a specific signaling pathway endpoint regulated solely by K(B)-Ras. It is likely that other Ras isoforms regulate PI-3 kinase and AKT. In previous work, we have shown that the N-Ras-negative cell lines also have depressed steady-state levels of activated AKT (31Wolfman J.C. Wolfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19315-19323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Wolfman J.C. Palmby T. Der C.J. Wolfman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1589-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although this does not apparently affect their ability to regulate MMP-2 expression. The mechanism that renders the PI-3 kinase/AKT-dependent regulation of MMP-2 expression specific for K(B)-Ras is unclear. It is possible that the subcellular localization of the specific K(B)- Ras, PI-3 kinase and AKT molecules that function to control the MMP-2 promoter significantly contribute toward specificity between c-K(B)-Ras, AKT and MMP-2 expression. Based on previous results and those reported in this communication, regulation of a specific downstream target is not necessarily sufficient to obtain an identical phenotype. Both c-N-Ras and c-K(B)-Ras can regulate steady-state AKT activity, but only c-K(B)-Ras does so in a manner that results in the corresponding regulation of MMP-2 expression. These subtle differences highlight the importance of performing experiments at endogenous levels of protein expression to avoid upsetting the delicate balance between these unique steady-state signaling pathways. Signal transduction has traditionally been examined by short-term stimulation of cells with agents that induce mitogenesis, differentiation, or apoptosis (36Crespo P. Leon J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1613-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 37Kerkhoff, E., and Rapp, U. R. (1998) 17, 1457–1462Google Scholar, 38Rebollo A. Martinez A.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found, however, that maintenance of basal cell function also requires “steady-state” signal transduction. In this specific instance, the steady-state production of a single matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-2, is regulated through the steady-state functions of c-K(B)-Ras, PI-3 kinase, and AKT. Our previous work using N-Ras-negative cells suggested that short-term signaling pathways readily adapt to the absence of essential signal transduction components (31Wolfman J.C. Wolfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19315-19323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Wolfman J.C. Palmby T. Der C.J. Wolfman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1589-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have found that cellular steady-state functions do not adapt as rapidly. Using immortalized N-Ras- and K-Ras-negative cell lines, we have identified a novel steady-state function for c-K(B)-Ras. The K-Ras-negative cell lines expressed detectable levels of only c-N-Ras. Consistent with our previous observations, we have not observed detectable levels of c-Ha-Ras in mouse fibroblasts, even as a compensatory mechanism for the loss of either the N-ras or K-ras genes. The K-Ras-negative cells failed to synthesize detectable levels of MMP-2, one of the matrix metalloproteinases involved in cell detachment, migration, and metastasis of invasive tumors. Failure to express the c-N-Ras gene product did not alter the levels of MMP-2 generation, suggesting a direct relationship between one of the K-Ras gene products and the steady-state production of MMP-2. Transient assays confirmed that only one of the K-Ras gene products, c-K(B)-Ras, is responsible for controlling the transcriptional activity of the MMP-2 gene. This observation is supported by the inhibition of basal MMP-2 production by transient expression of a dominant-negative Ras construct, N17-Ha-Ras, which functions through the sequestering of Ras exchange factors. The identification of steady-state Ras dependent functions opens novel possibilities regarding the role of each oncogenic Ras isoform in specific cancers. The common hypothesis of the involvement of Ras in the development of tumors has always stemmed from their role in short-term signal transduction. Given the data presented in this manuscript, we could now predict that tumors containing an activating K(B)-Ras rather than N-Ras should expressed elevated levels of MMP-2. This should result in a higher metastatic potential and probably a poorer overall prognosis. Therefore, although much of the transforming potential of each Ras isoform might arise from “continuous short-term signaling,” there is probably a secondary component that arises from changes in Ras isoform-dependent “steady-state” signal transduction that has been overlooked.

In this work, the conformational and functional properties of the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase have been determined using a wide array of biochemical and biophysical techniques. The results obtained clearly indicate that E. coli RecQ helicase is monomeric in solution up to a concentration of 20 μm and in a temperature range between 4 and 37 °C. Furthermore, these properties are not affected by the presence of ATP, which is strictly required for the unwinding and translocating activity of the protein, or by its nonhydrolyzable analogue 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. Consistent with the structural properties, functional analysis shows that both DNA unwinding activity and single-stranded DNA-stimulated ATPase specific activity were independent of RecQ concentration. The monomeric state was further confirmed by the ATPase-deficient mutants of RecQ protein. The rate of unwinding was unchanged when the wild type RecQ helicase was mixed with the ATPase-deficient mutants, indicating that nonprotein-protein interactions were involved in the unwinding processes. Taken together, these results indicate that RecQ helicase functions as a monomer and provide new data on the structural and functional properties of RecQ helicase that may help elucidate its mechanism action.

Genetic information is stored into the double-stranded DNA molecule that is stabilized through specific hydrogen-bonded base pairs. However, replication and repair as well as recombination of the DNA molecule require a single-stranded DNA to be available at least transiently. In cells, unwinding and separation of the complementary strands of duplex DNAs (dsDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-adenyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; TFA, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; NTP, nucleotide triphosphate; DNP, nucleotide diphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-adenyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; TFA, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; NTP, nucleotide triphosphate; DNP, nucleotide diphosphate. into single-stranded DNAs (ssDNA) are catalyzed by a class of enzymes known as helicases. DNA helicases destabilize and unwind the duplex DNA through a series of energetic states, driven by the binding and hydrolysis of NTP, usually ATP, and subsequent release of NDP and inorganic phosphate. Thus, DNA helicases convert the chemical energy into mechanical energy for DNA unwinding and translocation along the nucleic acid lattice (for reviews, see Refs. 1Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (2227): 2269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 3Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). During unwinding of dsDNA, and to translocate processively without dissociation from DNA, the helicase must use at least two DNA-binding sites to keep contact with the DNA lattice; one binds to ssDNA for translocating, whereas the other binds to dsDNA for DNA unwinding. These two DNA binding sites may be located at different domains within a single polypeptide of a monomer or be held by two different polypeptides within a dimer or an oligomer for providing multiple DNA-binding sites. Corresponding to the first possibility, the “inchworm” model was proposed, in which the helicase is assumed to possess two nonidentical DNA binding sites (4Yarranton G.T. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); the “leading” site binds both ssDNA and dsDNA and interacts with the duplex to be unwound during successive unwinding cycles, whereas the “lagging” site interacts only with ssDNA. The disruption of the dsDNA at the leading site and the translocation of the enzyme are the result of conformational change of the enzyme modulated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Recent crystal structures of complexes of PcrA helicase with a partial dsDNA duplex substrate show that the ssDNA and dsDNA bind, respectively, on two domains of this monomeric helicase (5Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). These data provided direct proof to support an inchworm mechanism (6Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Corresponding to the second possibility, the active “rolling” model requires that the enzyme be oligomeric and at least dimeric. Each protomer possesses an identical DNA binding site. Both sites could bind either ssDNA or dsDNA, and binding of ssDNA and dsDNA cannot occur simultaneously in the same subunit. Binding of ATP leads to the enzyme interacting alternatively with the ssDNA and dsDNA at the junction region. Furthermore, hydrolysis of ATP destabilizes hydrogen bonds between the base pairs of the duplex. This model was originally based on the observed allosteric effects of ATP and ADP on the ssDNA and dsDNA binding properties of the Escherichia coli Rep dimer (7Wong I. Lohman T.M. Science. 1992; 256: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structures of Rep helicase bound to ssDNA alone or bound to both ssDNA and ADP have revealed that the protein remained monomeric; no protein-protein interactions were observed (8Korolev S. Hsieh H. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). An essential difference between the “inchworm” and “rolling” model is that an oligomer, at least a dimer, is absolutely required for translocation and unwinding in the case of the rolling model, whereas a monomeric form or any oligomeric form could function in the inchworm model. Thus, the knowledge of the oligomeric structure of a helicase is of fundamental concern in understanding the mechanism by which the protein unwinds DNA. The objective of this work is to investigate the structural state of the E. coli RecQ helicase in solution, a protein of 610 amino acids, which is highly conserved across a wide variety of organisms including Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 (9Gangloff S.

The protein displays a 3′–5′ polarity in DNA unwinding, since it has been observed using nonsymmetrical DNA substrates (16Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this report, both structural and functional analyses show that the RecQ helicase functions as a monomer. These results should be helpful in understanding the mechanism of action of E. coli RecQ helicase and possibly of other members of the RecQ helicase family. Reagents—Chemicals were reagent grade, and all solutions were prepared using ELGApure water. ATP and AMPPNP were purchased from Sigma. Buffer A is 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Nucleic Acid Substrates—Oligonucleotides were purchased from Genset and further purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. A 100 μm working stock of double-stranded DNA was prepared by mixing equal concentrations of each oligonucleotide in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 100 mm NaCl, followed by heating the mix for 5 min at 85 °C and then cooling it slowly to room temperature.Table IOligonucleotide sequences used in this studySubstrateLengthStructure and sequenceaF represents the fluorescein chemical group.A215′-GTG TGG AAA ATC TCT AGC AGT-3′3′-CAC ACC TTT TAG AGA TCG TCA-F-5′B63/455′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGCTGCGGA(t18)-3′3′-F-TTAGGCAGCTCGTCTCAATCCCAATCCCAATCCCAATCGACGCCT-5′C335′-TTGATAGCAAAGGGATGCTCCGCCACCAGTGGG-3′D275′-GGAGATACAGTGCGCTGCAGCAACGGC-3′a F represents the fluorescein chemical group. Open table in a new tab Protein Expression—A full coding region of RecQ DNA was prepared by PCR using E. coli chromosome DNA. A 2.2-kb PCR product was cloned into pGEM®-T easy vector, and the sequence of this insert was shown to be identical to the published RecQ gene sequence (20Irion N. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The DNA corresponding to the coding sequence of the RecQ helicase gene was amplified again by PCR-mediated amplification, using a set of oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene. These primers had additional bases at each end for creation of restriction sites: NdeI at the 5′-end (5′-CAT ATG AAT GTG GCG CAG GCG GAA GTG TTG-3′) and XhoI at the 3′-end of the gene (5′-GCG CAT GTT GAT GGC GAT GAC GAA GAG TAG CTC GAG-3′) for expression of RecQ helicase bearing a hexahistidine tag at the NH2-terminal end or c-myc tag sequence at the 3′-end of the gene (5′-GCG CAT GTT GAT GGC GAT GAC GAA CAA AAA CTC ATC TCA GAA GAG GAT CTG TAG CTC GAG CGG-3′) for expression of RecQ helicase with c-myc epitope at the amino terminus. The amplified product was digested with NdeI and XhoI enzymes, and the appropriate size fragment (2100 bp) was gel-purified and subcloned, respectively, into NdeI/XhoI sites of the vector PET-15b and pNB5 (21Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The PET-15b vector encodes a hexahistidine tag at the amino terminus that allows purification of the expressed protein on a nickel-chelating column. A thrombin cleavage site was adjacent to the histidine tag. The constructed plasmid was expressed in E. coli strain BL 21(DE3). The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in terrific broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The expression of the protein was induced by adding isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside to 0.5 mm at low log phase (A 600 = 0.6). The culture was then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For expression of the RecQ helicase bearing a c-myc tag at the carboxyl terminus, but without the histidine tag at the amino terminus, the pNB5 vector containing the RecQ gene was transformed into EK 1104. The protein expression and purification were essentially as described by Benaroudj et al. (21Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—His-tagged RecQ helicase was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified under native conditions. Briefly, harvested cells were suspended in 30 ml of suspension buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl) and were lysed using a French pressure cell. The lysate was then sonicated in order to shear DNA into small fragments. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 70,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to the column charged with histidine binding resin (Novagen). The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole. The proteins bound to the column were eluted stepwise using 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) buffer containing 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 mm imidazole. RecQ helicase-containing fractions, identified by both DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and helicase activity assays, were pooled. The histidine tag was cleaved using biotinylated thrombin during a dialysis step. The removal of biotinylated thrombin was accomplished using streptavidin-agarose magnetic beads (Novagen, Madison, WI). RecQ helicase was further purified by FPLC size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200; Amersham Biosciences). Finally, ion exchange chromatography (DEAE Sephadex A-50) was used to remove the contaminating DNA. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol), and stored at –80 °C. The protein was pure as judged by Coomassie staining and electrospray mass spectrometry. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.54×104m–1 cm–1. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amino acid substitutions were made in conserved motif I (K55A) and in conserved motif II (D148A) using oligonucleotides C and D (Table I). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech). The mutant helicases were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified as described above for wild type enzyme. Immunoprecipitation—Anti-His tag monoclonal antibodies were immobilized onto CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B at 2.5 mg of protein/ml of packed beads (22Hsu Y.-T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 23Hsu Y-T. Molday R.S. Nature. 1993; 361: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). For homodimerization studies, 0.2 ml of the mix of 5 or 10 μm His-tagged and c-myc-tagged helicase was incubated at 4 °C in buffer A for 1 h. The samples were mixed with 150 μl of anti-His tag antibody beads. The beads were then washed twice with 5 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads by the addition of 180 μl of 0.1 m acetic acid containing 0.2% Triton X-100. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gels. For Western blotting analysis, 23 μl of the samples from immunoprecipitation experiments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were electroblotted onto Immobilon membranes. For immunoblotting analysis, the blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk, and incubated with anti-c-myc monoclonal antibodies (dilution 1:1000) for 45 min. The blots were then washed in phosphate buffer (0.05% Tween 20) and further incubated in blocking buffer containing 1:1000 anti-mouse immunoglobulin peroxidase for 30 min. The blots were washed again in phosphate buffer (0.05% Tween 20) and visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection kit. ATPase and Helicase Assay—The ATPase activity was measured according to the literature (24Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 260: 2281-2287Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). One unit of ATPase activity is defined as the amount of RecQ protein required to hydrolyze 1 nmol of ATP/min at 37 °C (16Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Helicase activity was determined by Xu et al. (25Xu H.Q. Zhang A.Z. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using DNA substrate B (Table I). Helicase-DNA Binding Activity Assay—Binding of RecQ helicase to DNA was analyzed by fluorescence polarization using a Beacon fluorescence polarization spectrophotometer (PanVera). RecQ helicase (200 nm) was added to a 150-μl aliquot of buffer A containing 1 nm of 21-mer fluorescein-labeled DNA (substrate A). Each sample was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C, after which fluorescence polarization was measured. In order to ensure that the mixture had reached equilibrium, the sample was further incubated for 30 min, and a second reading then was taken. No significant change was observed between the two measurements, indicating that equilibrium was reached. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was done at 25 °C, using an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences), on a Superdex 200 (analytical grade) column equilibrated with buffer A. Elution was performed using the same buffer. RecQ helicase was also analyzed using the buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and absorbance was measured at 280 and 260 nm. For ATP and AMPPNP experiments, 1 mm ATP or AMPPNP was present in all buffers. It is well known that proteins migrate through a gel filtration column as a function of both the molecular weight and the molecular shape. The RS values (RS designates the Stoke radius of the protein) of the RecQ molecule in different conditions were determined from the plot of log RS versus K av using the different Stokes radii of the standards. The partition coefficient K av was calculated using the formula K av = (Ve – V 0)/(Vt – V 0), where Ve is the elution volume of the sample, V 0 is the excluded volume of the column, and Vt is the total volume of the column. The excluded volume, V 0 (7.52 ml), and the total volume, Vt (23.5 ml) were measured by calibration with dextran blue and thymidine. The calibration graph of log RS versus K av was constructed using a high and low molecular weight calibration kit from Sigma (26Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar): cytochrome c (12.4 kDa; RS = 12 Å), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa; RS = 22.5 Å), albumin (67 kDa; RS = 35.5 Å), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa; RS = 38.75 Å), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa; RS = 85 Å). Assuming similar shape factors, the plot calibration of log M r versus Kav allowed the determination in a first approximation of the molecular weight of helicase. Sedimentation Velocity—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 4 °C with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An Ti 60 titanium four-hole rotor with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. Sample volumes of 400 μl in the buffer A were centrifuged at 55,000 rpm, and radial scans of absorbance (λ = 280 nm) were taken at 10-min intervals. The experimental base lines were measured for each sample at the end of the run. RecQ protein remained stable over the course of the run as shown by both the ATPase and the helicase activity assays. Data analysis and determination of the hydrodynamic parameters (the diffusion constant D and the sedimentation coefficient s) were performed using the computer programs supplied by Beckman, SEDNTERP and SVEDBERG supplied by John Philo. The partial specific volume v, 0.7286 ml/g, was calculated from the amino acid composition. Molecular mass is related to D and S by the equation, Mass=RTS/D(1-νρ)(Eq. 1) where ρ is the solvent density, and R and T are the molar gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out as described by Bailey et al (27Bailey M.F. Davidson B.E. Minton A.P. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). at 4 °C using different rotor speeds (from 4,500 to 15,000 rpm). Enzyme samples were dialyzed extensively against buffer A. During the dialysis, the buffer was changed three times. The reference cells were filled by the buffer used for the last dialysis. Radial scans of the absorbance at 280 nm were taken at 2-h intervals, and samples were judged to be at equilibrium by the absence of systematic deviation in overlaid successive scans and when a constant average M r was obtained in the plot of M r versus centrifugation time. RecQ protein remained stable over the course of the run as judged by both the ATPase and the helicase activity assays. The experimental data were fitted to a model for a single homogeneous species following the equation, A(r)={A(rm)expσ(r2-rm2)}+δ(Eq. 2) where σ = Wω2/2RT and W = M(1 – νρ), A(rm) is the absorbance of the solute at the meniscus, A(r) is the absorbance at a radial distance r from the center of rotation, and W is the buoyant molecular weight. M r and ν are the relative molecular weight and partial specific volume of solute, respectively, ρ is the density of the solvent, ω is the angular velocity, R and T are the molar gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively, and δ is the base line offset. The partial specific volume for the protein was calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein sample, and the densities of the different buffers were determined from published tables (28Wolf A.V. Brown M.G. Prentiss P.G. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: D219-D269Google Scholar, 29Durchschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-115Crossref Google Scholar). Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—The time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy was obtained from the two polarized emission decays Ivv(t) and Ivh(t), using the time-correlated single-photon counting technique. Ivv corresponds to the emission intensity (I) when both excitation and emission polarizers are vertical (v). Ivh corresponds to the emission intensity (I) when excitation polarizer is vertical (v) and emission polarizer is horizontal (h). The excitation light pulse source was a Ti-sapphire subpicosecond laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) associated with a third harmonic generator tuned at 299 nm for tryptophan fluorescence. The repetition of the laser was set down to 4 MHz, and to ensure the single-photon counting condition, the counting rate never exceeded 40 kHz. The excitation light pulse was triggered by a Hamamatsu photodiode (S4753). The fluorescence emission was detected through a monochromator (SpectraPro 150, ARC) set at the appropriate wavelength (Δλ = 15 nm) (emission wavelength was 350 nm). A time-correlated single photon-counting SPC-430 card (Becker-Hickl GmbH) was used for the acquisition. The function of the instrumental response of the laser pulse (100 ps) was recorded by detecting the light scattered by a water solution. The time scaling was 11 ps/channel, and 4096 channels were used. The two polarized components of the emission decay were collected until the total count of the Ivv component reached 15–20 million for tryptophan fluorescence or 25–35 million for fluorescein fluorescence. The microcell (volume 50 μl) was thermostated with a Haake type-F3 circulating bath. Unless otherwise specified, the Trp fluorescence measurement mixture included 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and helicase RecQ at the appropriate concentration in the presence of either 75 or 500 mm NaCl. The data were analyzed by the quantified maximum entropy method (30Brochon J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 262-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 31Livesey A.K. Brochon J-C. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 693-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), which displays the lifetime (τ) and the correlation time (Θ) distributions according to Equations 3 and 4, Ivv(t)=13×[∑i=1nαie-1/τ1(1+2∑j=1mρje-1/θj)](Eq. 3) Ivh(t)=13×[∑i=1nα1e-1/τ1(1-∑j=1mρje-1/θj)](Eq. 4) with ∑i=1nα1=1(Eq. 5) and ∑j=1mρj=r0(Eq. 6) where α i represents the relative population of fluorophores with life-time τ i , and ρ j represents the initial anisotropy of molecules characterized by the rotational correlation time Θ j. The decay of the total fluorescence intensity, IT (t), is calculated from both polarized components by the equation, Iτ(t)=Ivv(t)+2G×Ivh(t)(Eq. 7) where G represents the correction factor for the difference in the monochromator transmission between parallel and perpendicular polarized components (G-factor = Ivv/Ivh). The anisotropy (r) is then defined by the following relation. r(t)=Ivv(t)-G×Ivh(t)Iτ(t)=∑j=1mρje-1/θj(Eq. 8) For a spherical macromolecule, the hydrated molecular volume (V) is related to Θ by the Perrin equation, θ=ηVkT(Eq. 9) where η represents the viscosity, T the absolute temperature, and k is the Boltzman constant. Purification and Characterization of the RecQ Helicase—The RecQ helicase was overexpressed in and purified from E. coli. Gel electrophoresis of the protein in denaturing conditions gave a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of about 70 kDa, consistent with the value determined from the amino acid sequence (68,290 Da). The purity and the molecular mass of the protein were further confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, which gives a mass of 69,000 ± 250, with purity exceeding 95%. The protein purified as above is active as an ATPase with a specific activity of 420 units/μg of protein, which is comparable with the previous determinations (16Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The protein also displays DNA unwinding activity with an apparent unwinding rate of 2 bases/s, consistent with previous results (19Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 232-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Analysis of RecQ Helicase by Immunoprecipitation—RecQ helicase was first studied qualitatively by immunoprecipitation analysis. We reasoned that if RecQ helicase functions as an oligomer, the protein-protein interactions in the oligomer could be revealed by immunoprecipitation analysis. For this purpose, two different recombinant proteins were prepared; one was His-tagged at the NH2-terminal end, and the other had a c-myc epitope at the COOH-terminal end. A complex between the purified His-tagged and c-myc-tagged helicases was allowed to form at different concentrations of salt or different temperatures (between 20 and 42 °C) and in the absence or in the presence of ATP. Anti-His tag monoclonal antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate RecQ helicase in the complexes. The immunoprecipitated samples were then analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against c-myc epitope for detection of the c-myc-tagged helicase. The immunoprecipitation of His-tagged helicase by the anti-His tag monoclonal antibodies failed to co-precipitate the helicase having the c-myc epitope, even in the presence of ATP (results not shown). However, it is"

These include the 43–45-amino acid autoinhibitory element (AI) that attenuates electron transfer in the absence of CaM, and the C-terminal 20–40-amino acid tail that attenuates electron transfer in a CaM-independent manner. We constructed models of the reductase domains of the three NOS isoforms to predict the structural basis for CaM-dependent regulation. We have identified and characterized a loop (CD2A) within the NOS connecting domain that is highly conserved by isoform and that, like the AI element, is within direct interaction distance of the CaM binding region. The eNOS CD2A loop (eCD2A) has the sequence 834KGSPGGPPPG843, and is truncated to 809ESGSY813 (iCD2A) in iNOS. The eCD2A contributes to the Ca2+ dependence of CaM-bound activity to a level similar to that of the AI element. The eCD2A plays an autoinhibitory role in the control of NO, and CaM-dependent and -independent reductase activity, but this autoinhibitory function is masked by the dominant AI element. Finally, the iCD2A is involved in determining the salt dependence of NO activity at a post-flavin reduction level.

The NOS oxygenase domain is completely different from a P450, however, in that it has no sequence identity with that family of enzymes and has an α,β-fold structure distinct from the highly α-helical structure of the P450 enzymes (3Crane B.R.

Furthermore, the two-stage mechanism for the oxidation of l-arginine to l-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO) by NOS is more complex than that of a P450 enzyme, as it requires tetrahydro-biopterin (H4B) as a transient electron donor (7Bec N.

In contrast, the NOS reductase domain exhibits considerable sequence identity with CPR, and the electrons, as in P450/CPR, flow from NADPH to the FAD, then to the FMN, and finally, upon substrate binding, to the heme (2Nathan C.

In the cytochrome P450 system, the principal control on inter-protein electron transfer is the requirement for association of the P450 with CPR.

However, inter-domain electron transfer in NOS also requires the binding of CaM, and the Ca2+ dependence of CaM binding differs between the constitutive and inducible isoforms (11Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 12Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The three NOS isoforms are classified according to their dependence on Ca2+ for CaM binding (2Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar). The inducible isoform (iNOS or NOS II) is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. It irreversibly binds CaM in a Ca2+-independent manner and exhibits the highest catalytic activity of the three isoforms (11Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The constitutively expressed isoforms, eNOS (or NOS III) and nNOS (or NOS I), bind CaM reversibly in a Ca2+-dependent manner (10Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30036-30042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp.

These differences in activity and regulation reflect the functions of the proteins; a tempered activity is consistent with the roles of the constitutive forms in functions such as blood pressure regulation and neuronal signaling, and a strong burst of activity with that of the inducible form in the immune response to pathogens. Interest in controlling the activities of the individual NOS isoforms currently centers on their roles in inflammatory responses such as arthritis and septic shock as well as in homeostatic diseases such as hypertension (14Christopherson K.S. Bredt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2424-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We have sought to define the structural and chemical elements that control electron transfer in the different NOS isoforms by comparing the NOS family with homologous proteins. The redox behavior of the iNOS reductase domain is similar to that of CPR, and iNOS is capable of high electron transfer rates to exogenous acceptors in the absence of CaM. The flavin domain of iNOS is most similar to that of CPR in sequence, whereas those of eNOS and nNOS exhibit slightly lower identity to CPR as a result of the site-specific insertion of additional residues (Ref. 1Nishida C.R. Knudsen G.M. Straub W. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Drug Metab. Rev. 2001; 34: 479-501Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar and references therein). The elements within the eNOS and nNOS reductase domains that distinguish them from the iNOS reductase domain and CPR may help to govern the high and low activities of the CaM-bound and CaM-free enzymes, respectively, because CaM binding strictly regulates electron transfer between the reductase and heme domains as well as between flavins within the reductase (15Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences in electron transfer activity with and without CaM can be observed when the nNOS heme and reductase domains are independently expressed (16McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the elements that control the CaM dependence and relatively low rate of electron transfer to the heme domain in eNOS appear to be localized entirely within the reductase domain because NOS chimeras with the eNOS oxygenase domain fused to the iNOS or nNOS reductase domain exhibit high activities (18Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Conversely, chimeras in which the eNOS reductase domain is fused to the iNOS or nNOS oxygenase domain have low, eNOS-like activities (18Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This CaM regulation of electron transfer rates is postulated to be mainly conformational in nature, because CaM binding has been shown to have no effect on the midpoint potentials of the flavins (19Noble M.A. Munro A.W. Rivers S.L. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Yellowlees L.J. Shimizu T. Sagami I. Guillemette J.G. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16413-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and no effect on spin-relaxation rates of the flavin radical (20Perry J.M. Moon N. Zhao Y. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 355-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in nNOS. CaM binding accelerates electron flow within the reductase domain, but electron transfer through the flavins and from them to alternate exogenous acceptors still occurs at low rates even in the absence of CaM (21Matsuda H. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Alignment of the NOS primary sequences identifies differences that could be responsible for the differences in the constitutive and inducible isoforms. The largest sequence difference between the reductase domains of the three NOS isoforms is a 43–45-amino acid insert (at residue 595 of eNOS and 835 of nNOS) that is absent in iNOS. Excision of this autoinhibitory (AI) element from eNOS or nNOS enhances the CaM-dependent NO-synthesizing activity to a level approaching that of iNOS (22Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20116-20124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, complete Ca2+ independence analogous to that of iNOS is not obtained upon deletion of the AI element, so other reductase domain elements must also interact with CaM. An ∼20–40-amino acid extension at the C terminus is a second feature that distinguishes the NOS enzymes from CPR (24Lane P. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19087-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Trimming this extension causes CaM-independent hyper-activity of interflavin electron-transfer in all three NOS isoforms, but NO production is only slightly increased in iNOS and is decreased in eNOS and nNOS (25Roman L.J. Miller R.T. de la Garza M.A. Kim J-J.P. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Roman L.J. Martasek P. Miller R.T.

However, in contrast to removal of the AI insert, truncation of the terminal extensions does not alter the Ca2+ dependence of CaM binding. In eNOS, phosphorylation of the C terminus provides an alternative route for activation of electron transfer that is independent of the Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism (24Lane P. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19087-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Altering the C terminus may loosen a tightly tuned electron transfer system, so that either deletion of the unique tails or phosphorylation increases flavin reduction and consequently NO activity in a CaM-independent manner. Further supporting this argument, mutation of the FNR-family conserved C-terminal aromatic residue in nNOS similarly increases electron transfer rates in the absence of CaM (27Adak S. Sharma M. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 13516-13521Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have added structural models to the sequence-based analysis of CaM-related regulatory elements. Partial reductase structures of nNOS have been solved (28Zhang J. Martasek P. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Kim J-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37506-37513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or predicted (29Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), but our models of the full reductase domain allow placement of the various regulatory elements relative to the flavin subdomains. Furthermore, comparison between isoforms identifies a unique loop (CD2A) within the connecting domain that is highly conserved by isoform, but non-conserved between them and CPR (Fig. 1). In eNOS, the NOS isoform with the slowest electron transfer and overall activity rates, this loop is 5 amino acids longer than in iNOS. In our models, this CD2A is extended toward the base of the CaM-binding helix (30Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Kent J.D. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (6440): 6535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and is able to provide several electrostatic interactions with either the FMN subdomain or CaM itself. The structure of CaM bound to a peptide corresponding to eNOS residues 492–510 was recently solved and includes residues at the N terminus of the eNOS model (31Aoyagi M. Arvai A.S. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Given the distance and orientation constraints for the position of the peptide bound by CaM, both the CD2A and the AI elements are modeled to be within contact distance of the CaM-binding region (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Subdomain structure of the NOS reductase domain. The homology model of the eNOS reductase domain is shown as a ribbon diagram, with the FMN, FAD, and NADPH cofactors shown in black stick representations. Below is a schematic alignment of the NOS reductase domain against CPR, flavodoxin, and ferredoxin reductase. Gray colors in the schematic sequence correspond to grays in the ribbon diagram. In medium gray, the FMN subdomain is shown to be of the flavodoxin fold, and it contains the last turn of the CaM-binding helix at the N terminus. Only eNOS and nNOS contain the AI, and its insertion point is indicated on the structure by arrows and within the sequence as a black inset. The connecting domain is shown in dark gray and is split into two portions, the CD1 and CD2, by a short section of the FAD/NADPH domain. The FAD/NADPH subdomain in pale gray corresponds to the fold of ferredoxin reductase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the hypothesis that the CD2A loop provides a control mechanism that links CaM binding to intra-reductase electron flow, we have investigated mutants of both the wild-type and chimeric enzymes in which the AI and CD2A sequences were either deleted or exchanged. We report here that the CD2A loop, in concert with the AI element, cooperatively governs electron transfer within the reductase domains of the constitutive NOS isoforms. Alignments—Related proteins were identified using PSI-BLAST (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), and sequence conservation was evaluated. Multiple rounds of modeling were performed, using various sets of templates ranging from CPR alone to a maximum of five templates. Reported here are the final models generated using the following templates: 1AMO, 1B1C, 1BVY (chain F), 1DDG, and 1F20 (8Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.-J.P. Proc.

These structures represent CPR, P450BM-3, the β-subunit of sulfite reductase (SiR-FP), and nNOS, all of which had >20% conserved sequence identity with the NOS reductase domains. The templates were structurally aligned using COMPARER (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 203-428Crossref Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To align each NOS reductase to the templates, pair-wise alignments between NOS and 1AMO were initially created using PSI-BLAST.

In the C-terminal portion of the NOS reductase for which the rat nNOS structure was solved in 1F20, the human NOS sequences were aligned to 1F20 using ClustalW. The final NOS-to-templates alignment was combined with the template alignment from COMPARER and used as input for MODELER (43Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). Model Validation—After processing in MODELER, the AMBER simulation package version 6.0 was used to minimize the proteins (44Cornell W. Cieplak P. Gould B.C.I. Merz K. Ferguson D. Spellmeyer D. Fox T. Caldwell J. Kollman P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar). To do this, the LEAP program of AMBER was used to prepare the structures. The structures were minimized by performing 4000 steps of steepest-descent minimization to resolve moderate and large energy conflicts. After minimization, the models were evaluated and compared with the template structures as well as unminimized models using WHAT IF version 4.99, PROCHECK version 3.5.4, and PROSA version 2.0 (45Sippl M.J.

Huang C.C. Jarvis L.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 13-27Crossref Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Materials—HEPES and agarose were from Fisher. DNA manipulations were done using enzymes, buffers, and reagents from New England Biolabs and purification kits from Qiagen, which also supplied the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized, and the DNA sequenced, by the Biomolecular Resource Center (University of California, San Francisco). Agar was from Invitrogen, H4B from Alexis (San Diego, CA), isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside from Promega, and LB, yeast extract, and tryptone from Difco. All other materials were purchased from Sigma. General PCR Cycling—A Progene thermocycler from Techne (Cambridge, United Kingdom) was employed. Mutagenesis was accomplished by standard overlap extension PCR techniques, utilizing as the template previously constructed NOS chimeras that possess engineered NheI splice sites at amino acids 760–761, 538–539, and 527–528 in nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS, respectively (18Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). End primers utilized the NheI splice site, the post-termination XbaI cloning site, or preexisting unique sites within the gene (iNOS BsrGI and eNOS KpnI). All PCR reactions utilized 0.5 μm primers, Vent® polymerase, which possesses 3′ to 5′ proofreading activity, and Vent® polymerase buffer. Me2SO was added when necessary as specified. Construction of Parental N/I(eCD2A)—The first step toward creating CD2A-swapped mutants was construction of N/I(eCD2A), which was the parent for the /iNOS(eCD2A) reductase module. A “megaprimer” method was used to fuse sequences from iNOS and eNOS (52Ke S.-H. Madison E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2271-3372Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). First, flanking primers (forward, 5′-CAAACTGTGT GCCTGGAGGT TCTGGAGAAA GGATCCCCAG GCGGCCCTC; and reverse, 5′-GGCTGAGTGA GCAGGGGGGC AGCCGTGGGT CCCGCACCCA GCTGGGAGGA GGGCCGCCTG GGGATC) produced megaprimer Iecdmega, which possessed external sequences corresponding to iNOS (up to Leu-800 and after Lys-811), an internal sequence corresponding to the eNOS CD2A domain (Glu-835 to Pro-850), and a silent BamHI site to facilitate screening. This megaprimer was used with primer “pre-BsrGI” (5′-CACAGTCCTC TTTGCTAGCG AGACAGGGAA GTCT) to produce PCR product A, and with primer (5′-GCGCGCCGAA GCTTTCAGAG CCTCGTGGCT TTG) to give B. Final PCR product AB was synthesized using 10 ng each of A, B, and the two end primers (A plus B, 3% Me2SO, one cycle of 5 min at 94 °C and 5 min at 72 °C; the end primers were then added, followed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, then one 15-min 72 °C extension). AB was subcloned into the N/I via BsrGI and XbaI sites to produce the N/I(eCD2A) chimera. Construction of I/I(eCD2A)—I/I(eCD2A) was subcloned from N/I-(eCD2A) into I/E via NheI and XbaI sites. Construction of E/E(iCD2A) and E/E(ΔAI)(iCD2A)—The procedure was identical to that used for the construction of N/I(eCD2A), except primers EimF (5′-GTCTGTGGCT GTGGAGCAGC TGGATGAGAG CGGATCCTAC TGGGTCAAAG AC) and EimR (5′-CGCACGGTGC ACGGGGGCAG CCTCTTGTCT TTGACCCAGT AGGATC) were used to synthesize the megaprimer, and 5′ primer (5′-CCAGACCCCT GGAAAACTAG TGCGACCAAG GGCGC) and 3′ primer (5′-GCCCTTTCGT CTTCAAGCAG ATCTGAAAAA AAAGCC) were used as end primers. Two-minute steps at 94 °C were used in place of 1-min 94 °C steps. Subcloning into E/E or E/E(ΔAI) was accomplished using KpnI and XbaI to produce E/E(iCD2A) and E/E(ΔAI)(iCD2A), whose eNOS reductase CD2A sequence (Glu-835 to Pro-850) has been replaced by that of iNOS CD2A (Asp-801 to Lys-811). Activity Assays—The rate of NO synthesis, determined using the oxyhemoglobin assay, and the cytochrome c reduction rate were both determined at 37 °C according to previously published methods (18Nishida C.R.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine the Ca2+ dependence of activity, free Ca2+ was calculated at a constant ionic strength of 100 mm KCl using the K d (Ca2+-EGTA) = 27.9 nm at pH 7.50, 37 °C (22Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Alignments and Template Selection for Modeling—Modeling of the reductase domains for each NOS isoform was accomplished through several iterations of sequence alignment followed by structural modeling with MODELER (43Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). Initially PSI-BLAST was used to query the peptide data bank hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information for non-redundant proteins with sequence homology to the NOS reductase domains (53National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, Building 38A, Bethesda, MDGoogle Scholar). After three iterations of PSI-BLAST, the diverse list of homologous proteins included, as expected, the NOS isoforms, the CPR family, flavodoxins, and ferredoxin reductases (FNR).

https://openalex.org/W2058469793,"A fundamental aspect of visuomotor behavior is deciding where to look or move next. Under certain conditions, the brain constructs an internal representation of stimulus location on the basis of previous knowledge and uses it to move the eyes or to make other movements. Neuronal responses in primary visual cortex were modulated when such an internal representation was acquired: Responses to a stimulus were affected progressively by sequential presentation of the stimulus at one location but not when the location was varied randomly. Responses of individual neurons were spatially tuned for gaze direction and tracked the Bayesian probability of stimulus appearance. We propose that the representation arises in a distributed cortical network and is associated with systematic changes in response selectivity and dynamics at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing."

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis remain obscure. The first biological activity linked to HBx was transcriptional transactivation activity on a variety of viral and cellular promoters (6Murakami S. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 36: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). HBx does not directly bind to ds DNA but has been shown to interact with components of basal transcription machinery (7Qadri I. Maguire H.F. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, HBx is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm, and very little, if any, is distributed to the nucleus of transfected cells (13Henkler F. Hoare J. Waseem N. Goldin R.D. McGarvey M.J.

Buendia M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2115-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In Chang liver cells, HBx failed to induce apoptosis; however, it did sensitize cells to apoptosis triggered by TNF-α through c-Myc activation and stress-related MAP kinase pathways (33Su F. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8744-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Taken together, these seemingly contradictory results suggest that HBx may modulate both preapoptotic and antiapoptotic pathways, dependent upon different cell settings. Previously, we demonstrated that HBx can effectively suppress TGF-β-induced apoptosis in Hep 3B hepatoma cell line by stimulating PI 3-kinase activity (24Shih W.L. Kuo M.L. Chuang S.E. Cheng A.L. Doong S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25858-25864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized the mechanism by which HBx activated PI 3-kinase. Src tyrosine kinase activity was activated by transactivation-proficient HBx. The Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 and C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) alleviated HBx-mediated PI 3-kinase activation and protection from TGF-β-induced apoptosis. The link from Src to PI 3-kinase was demonstrated to provide a survival signal in HBx-expressing hepatoma cells. In addition to the reported compartmentalization of HBx in nucleus and cytoplasm (cytosol, mitochondria), the association of HBxGFP fusion proteins with periplasmic membrane was observed. Neither periplasmic membrane-targeted nor nucleus-targeted HBxGFP was able to activate Src activity or to augument p85 phosphorylation. Antibodies, Reagents, and Plasmids—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GFP expressed in Escherichia coli were employed for detection of HBx-GFP fusion protein. The anti-Csk antibody, anti-Src antibody and anti-phosphotyrosine(clone 4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibody for the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PP2, TGF-β, enolase, phosphatidylinositol were purchased from Sigma. pRT-GFP, pRT-HBxGFP, pRT-HBx7GFP, pRT-HBx61GFP, pRT-HBx69GFP, and pRT-HBx90–91GFP were generated in previous study (24Shih W.L.

Briefly, point mutations were introduced to alter the following amino acids HBx7 (amino acid 7; Cys changed to Ser), HBx61 (amino acid 61; Cys changed to Leu), HBx69 (amino acid 69; Cys changed to Leu), and HBx90–91 (amino acid 90; Pro changed to Val, and amino acid 91; Lys changed to Leu). While HBx7GFP retained its transactivation activity, HBx61GFP, HBx69GFP, and HBx90–91GFP lost their transactivation ability (24Shih W.L. Kuo M.L. Chuang S.E. Cheng A.L. Doong S.L. J. Biol.

Virol. 1998; 72: 266-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSRα-Csk (kindly provided from Dr. M. Okada) was digested with MluI. The 1.4-kbp Csk cDNA fragment was isolated, treated with Klenow fragment, and ligated into BamHI/Klenow treated pREV-TRE retroviral vector, generating pRT-Csk. For construction of periplasmic membrane-targeted HBx-GFP fusion protein expression vector, pRT-HBxGFPRas4B, Ras4B prenylation signal was fused into the C-terminal domain of the HBx-GFP fusion protein. Briefly, two oligonucleotides (Ras4B-U: 5′-GAG CAA AGA TGG TAA AAA GAA GAA AAA GAA ATC AAA GAC AAA GTG TGT AAT TAT GTG A-3′, Ras4B-L: 5′-TCA CAT AAT TAC ACA CTT TGT CTT TGA CTT CTT TTT CTT CTT TTT ACC ATC TTT GCT C-3′) were synthesized, annealed, treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and ligated into SmaI-cut pGFPemd-bm, generating pGFPRas4B. An 800-bp DNA fragment, isolated from HindIII-digested pGFPRas4B, was ligated with the 7029-bp DNA fragment isolated from HindIII-digested pRT-HBxGFP, generating pRT-HBxGFPRas4B. For construction of nucleus-targeted HBx-GFP fusion protein expression vector, pRT-HBxGFPNLSMYC, nucleus localization signal of SV40 large T antigen was fused into the C-terminal of HBx-GFP fusion protein. A 130-bp DNA fragment, isolated from NotI- and XbaI-digested pCMV/GFP/NLS/myc (Invitrogen) was ligated with SmaI-cut pGFPemd-bm, generating pGFPNLSMYC. A 840-bp DNA fragment, isolated from HindIII-digested pGFPNLSMYC, was ligated with the 7029-bp DNA fragment isolated from HindIII-digested pRT-HBxGFP, generating pRT-HBxGFPNLSMYC. Cell Culture—Hep 3B cells were cultured in a minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with Earle's salt, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), fungizone 1.25 μg/ml at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. PT67, retrovirus packaging cell line, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), fungizone 1.25 μg/ml at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Hep 3B stable transfectants, with doxycycline-inducible expression of GFP, HBx, HBx-GFP, HBx7-GFP, HBx61-GFP, HBx69-GFP, HBx90–91-GFP, HBxGFPNLSMYC, or HBxGFPRas4B were generated as described previously (24Shih W.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25858-25864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and cultured in complete MEM medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml hygromycin. Transfection and Retrovirus Infection—DNAs were introduced into cells through transfection or retrovirus infection. Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method according to the procedure described by Chen et al. (35Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). For retrovirus infection, media was collected from virus-producing PT67 cell line, filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. After addition of polybrene to final 0.4 μg/ml, the whole mixture was poured into target cells. After incubation for 16 h, the virus-containing media were aspirated. Cells were washed, incubated for two additional days before they were ready for selection or analysis. Src Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed with Src lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet-40, 2 mm orthovanadate, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 mm EDTA), immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibody followed by protein-A Sepharose. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer, once with 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, once with kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2), then resuspended in kinase assay buffer containing 0.2 μg of acid-denatured enolase, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Kinase reaction was stopped with 2× sample loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Src kinase activity assay kit using peptide KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. TGF-β-induced Cytotoxicity Assay—2 × 105 Hep 3B cells were seeded onto a 35-mm tissue culture plate. 24 h after inoculation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in serum free MEM for 48 h. TGF-β were then added to a culture medium at various concentrations. 48 h after treatment, cells were collected by trypsinization and suspended in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Viable and non-viable cells were then determined by direct counting using hemocytometer in the presence of trypan blue. Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Assay—PI 3-kinase activities were assayed according to a procedure described previously (36Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm orthovanadate). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Clone 4G10) overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for1hat 4 °C, washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6) and twice with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The immunocomplex was preincubated on ice for 10 min with 10 μlof20mm Hepes (pH 7.4), containing 2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Sigma). Kinase reaction was performed by the addition of 40 μl of the reaction buffer (10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2) at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl and extracted with 200 μl of a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol. The radiolabeled lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography and visualized using a phosphorimager. DNA Fragmentation Analysis—Cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40). The supernatant was collected and incubated with RNase at a final concentration of 500 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. The mixtures were then incubated overnight at 55 °C. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in TE8.0 and subjected to 1.7% agarose gel electrophoresis. Subcellular Fractionation—This experiment was performed as described by Krajewski et al. (37Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 15 min before disruption of cells by passing through 26-gauge needle 15 times. Unbroken cells and nuclei were obtained by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets (containing mitochondria, lysosome, Golgi, and rough endoplasmic reticulum) were collected and designated as heavy membrane fraction. The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation again at 150,000 × g in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor for 60 min. The pellets were collected and designated as light membrane fraction. The resulting supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction. All fractions were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using various antibodies. Membrane Flotation—The analysis was performed as described by Matsumato et al. (38Matsumato M. Hsieh J.Y. Zhu N. Vanarscdle T. Hwang S.B. Jeng K.S. Gorbalenya A.E. Lo S.Y. Ou J.H. Ware C.F. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 15 min before disruption of cells by passing through 26-gauge needle 15 times. Unbroken cells and nuclei were obtained by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. 0.5 ml of the resulting supernatant was dispersed into 2 ml 72%(wt/wt) sucrose in low salt buffer (LSB) (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and overlaid with 2.5 ml of 55%(w/w) sucrose in LSB and 0.6 ml of 10% (w/w) sucrose in LSB. Centrifugation was done in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C for 12 h at 38,000 rpm. After centrifugation, fractions (0.8 ml per fraction) were collected from the top of the gradient. The pelleted fraction contained cytoplasmic organelles. The first fraction from the top contained plasma membrane. The plasma membrane fraction was diluted with 4 ml of LSB and subjected to centrifugation in Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C for 1.5 h at 46,000 rpm. Proteins from nuclei, organelles and plasma membrane pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane then detected by Western blot using various antibody. Enhancement of Src Tyrosine Kinase Activity by Transactivation-proficient HBx—The synthetic peptide KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK or enolase was utilized as a substrate to measure Src kinase activity in Hep 3B cells with doxycycline-regulatable expression of GFP, HBx, and various HBx-GFP fusion proteins. The activity assay was performed 24h after induction of the indicated proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, transactivation-proficient HBx, HBx-GFP, HBx7-GFP resulted in a substantial increase of Src kinase activity but transactivation-deficient HBx61-GFP, HBx69-GFP, HBx90–91-GFP did not. The same results were observed 48 h after induction, indicating that activation of Src kinase activity by HBx was constitutive. The ability of HBx to activate Src correlated well with its ability to activate PI 3-kinase and to protect cells from TGF-β-induced apoptosis (24Shih W.L. Kuo M.L. Chuang S.E. Cheng A.L. Doong S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25858-25864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Src Family Kinase Inhibitor, PP2, Alleviated the HBx Anti-apoptotic Response—To examine the involvement of Src tyrosine kinase in HBx-mediated anti-apoptotic effects in Hep 3B cells, the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2, was utilized. As shown in Fig. 2, cells overexpressing the transactivation-proficient HBx (including HBx, HBx-GFP, HBx7-GFP) lost their ability to resist TGF-β-induced apoptosis in the presence of PP2. This result indicated that Src plays an important role in mediating the HBx anti-apoptotic signaling against TGF-β. Csk Diminished HBx-induced PI 3-Kinase Activation and HBx-mediated Anti-apoptotic Effect Against TGF-β—Having identified both Src and PI 3-kinase as important signaling molecules in mediating the HBx anti-apoptotic effect, we next attempted to determine the relationship between the two signaling molecules. Csk is a tyrosine kinase that specifically phosphorylates the C-terminal tyrosine of Src kinases and returns them to an inactive state (39Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Csk can be used to block the activity of Src family kinases and test whether Src is functioning upstream of PI 3-kinase. Vectors with doxycycline-inducible expression of Csk were introduced into Hep 3B cells with doxycycline-regulatable expression of GFP, HBx, and HBx-GFP. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, expression of Csk diminished Src activation mediated by HBx or HBx-GFP. Csk alleviated HBx-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, and consequentially PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 4B). HBx-mediated protection against TGF-β-induced DNA fragmentation was not evident in cells expressing Csk as shown in Fig. 4C. Thus, HBx activated Src and subsequently PI 3-kinase, thereby transmitting a crucial survival signaling against TGF-β-induced apoptosis.Fig. 4Csk alleviated HBx-mediated anti-apoptotic effect. Hep 3B cells with doxycycline-regulatable expression of GFP, HBx or HBx-GFP were infected with recombinant retrovirus containing a doxycycline-regulatable expression cassette of Csk. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were collected and treated with doxycycline for 24 h or were not treated. Subsequently, lysates from cells treated with (+) or without (–) doxycycline were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (panel A) or subjected to PI 3-kinase activity assay (panel B). A, elevation of p85 phosphorylation level by HBx or HBx-GFP was abolished by the expression of Csk. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody. The immunocomplex was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) or anti-p85 antibody. Cell lysates were separated on polyacrylamide gels and subjected to direct immunoblotting with anti-Csk or anti-HBx antibody. B, the elevated PI 3-kinase activity induced by HBx or HBx-GFP was diminished by the expression of Csk. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The immunocomplex was subjected to in vitro kinase assay using phosphatidylinositol as the substrate. The production of 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was analyzed by thinlayer chromatography. C, HBx-mediated protection against TGF-β-induced DNA fragmentation was not evident in cells with Csk expression. Cells treated with (+) or without (–) doxycycline were cultured in serum-free media for 48 h, treated with (upper panel) or without (lower panel) TGF-β (5 ng/ml) for 16 h. DNAs were then extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HBx Was Able to Associate with Periplasmic Membrane— Analogous to its promiscuous biological functions, the subcellular localization of HBx also remains controversial.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2051-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that HBx stimulates the activity of several periplasmic membrane-associated signaling molecules, such as Src, Ras, and PI 3-kinase, HBx might work in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. We examined the possible distribution of HBx in the periplasmic cellular membrane and elucidated its role in activation of Src. Systemic subcellular fractionation was utilized to examine the distribution of ectopically expressed HBx-GFP in different cellular compartment. Antibodies against specific molecules in each compartment were utilized to verify the fractionation efficiency. As shown in Fig. 5A, 51.4% of HBx-GFP was found to be associated with the nucleus, 14.5% in the cytosol, 32.6% in the heavy membrane fraction, and 1.5% in the light membrane fraction. Membrane flotation assay revealed that a small proportion of HBx-GFP was indeed associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B). GFP alone was never detected in the plasma membrane fraction. As expected, the majority of Src was found to be associated with the plasma membrane, as revealed by the presence of Src in the light membrane fraction. Neither Membrane-bound nor Nucleus-targeted HBx-GFP Fusion Protein Was Able to Activate Src and Augument Tyrosine Phosphorylation of p85—To examine the biological role played by HBx-GFP in the nucleus or periplasmic membrane, vectors with periplasmic membrane-targeted (HBxGFPRas4B) or nucleus-targeted (HBxGFPNLSMYC) fusion proteins were constructed. When introduced into cells, HBxGFPNLSMYC was primarily detected in the nucleus and HBxGFPRas4B was mainly localized in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 6). However, in contrast with HBx or HBx-GFP, induced expression of HBxGFPRas4B or HBxGFPNLSMYC (Fig. 7A) failed to activate Src (Fig. 7B). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 was not altered by either nucleus-targeted or periplasmic membrane-targeted forms of HBx-GFP (Fig. 7C).Fig. 7Src activity and tyrosine phosphorylation level of p85 were not altered by HBxGFPNLSMYC or HBxGFPRas4B. After incubation with doxycycline for 24 h or not, Hep 3B cells with expression of indicated gene products were harvested and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation. A, Western blot analysis showing inducible expression of indicated gene products using anti-HBx polyclonal antibody. Actin was included as an internal control. B, lysates of cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibody. The immunocomplex was analyzed for Src activity (upper panel) using synthetic peptide as a substrate or immunoblotted with anti-Src antibody (lower panel) to monitor the expression level of Src. C, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody. The immunocomplex was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) (upper panel) or anti-p85 antibody (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, we have shown that HBx activates PI 3-kinase and protect Hep 3B cells from TGF-β-induced apoptosis (24Shih W.L.

In this study, we tried to elucidate mechanism(s) by which HBx activates PI 3-kinase. Src activity was elevated in Hep 3B cells following expression of transactivation-proficient HBx and HBx-GFP. Both Csk and PP2 alleviated the effect of HBx on activation of PI 3-kinase and protection against TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that HBx up-regulated a survival signal by linking Src to PI 3-kinase. HBx activation of Src promotes reverse transcription in the HBV DNA replication (3Klein N.P. Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Kobarg C. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), cell cycle transition from G1 to S (28Bouchard M. Giannakopoulos S. Wang E.H. Tanese N. Schneider R.J. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Our study provided an additional biological function of HBx via the activation of Src. Biochemical studies of Src-dependent signaling in vitro and genetic studies of knockout mice have revealed an extraordinary range of functions for Src family kinases, including control of development, regulation of apoptosis, and control of cell cycle progression (43Martin G.S. Nature Rev. 2001; 2: 467-475Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that many of the other phenotypic effects of HBx expression that have been described may be attributable to the signaling pathway that is dependent on Src. However, HBx protein has been shown to stimulate many additional signaling cascades, such as PKC (17Kekule A.S. Laner U. Weiss L. Luber B. Hofschneider P.H.

Dependent upon different cell settings, the possibility that HBx could result in different ultimate functions within a given cell line cannot be excluded. Genistein, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was also able to alleviate HBx-mediated anti-apoptotic effect in our model system (data not shown). In addition to the Src kinase, the involvement of other tyrosine kinase signaling molecules cannot be excluded. The exact contribution and significance of various signaling transduction pathways on HBx-mediated biological functions remains to be defined. Benn and Schneider (44Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) indicated that HBx leads to the formation of the active Ras-GTP complex in NIH 3T3 and Chang liver cells. Activation of Src family kinases was demonstrated to be indispensable for HBx-mediated activation of Ras (16Klein N.P. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The activated Ras-GTP complex was reported to bind to p110, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, thereby resulting in the activation of PI 3-kinase (45Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Is Ras activation required by HBx in the signaling pathway from Src to PI 3-kinase? Ras activity was not altered in the presence of HBx in Hep 3B cells (data not shown). Therefore, HBx activated Src and subsequently PI 3-kinase in the absence of Ras activation in our model system. The observation that the binding of the SH3 domain of Src family kinases to a proline-rich region within the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase could result in the activation of PI 3-kinase (46Pleiman C.M. Hertz M.W. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) implies that Src does not require Ras or another intermediate molecule for activation of PI 3-kinase, and therefore substantiates our finding. Polyoma Middle T Antigen (PMT) is identified as the tumorigenic component of the polyoma virus. PMT forms a complex with Src and PI 3-kinase, subsequently activating PI 3-kinase (47Courtneidge S.A. Heber A. Cell. 1987; 50: 1031-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Unlike PMT, HBx does not directly bind to Src (data not shown, Refs. 3Klein N.P. Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Kobarg C. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and 16Klein N.P. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). HBx does not act on Src α-phosphatase or Csk either (3Klein N.P. Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Kobarg C. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Klein N.P. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These data indicate that some other upstream regulators of the Src family are involved in HBx-mediated effects. Recently, Bouchard et al. (48Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Schneider R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HBx increased cytosolic calcium concentrations leading to the activation of Pyk2, a Src kinase activator, and consequentially activation of Src kinase. It remains to be elucidated whether Pyk2 is involved in the HBx-mediated survival signaling pathway from Src to PI 3-kinase. The cellular localization of HBx has been controversial, but the general consensus is that most HBx is located in the cytoplasm, with only a small fraction in the nucleus. Henkler et al. (13Henkler F. Hoare J. Waseem N. Goldin R.D. McGarvey M.J. Koshy R. King I.A. J. Gen Virol. 2001; 82: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that HBx was predominantly localized in nuclei in weakly expressing cells. However, at elevated levels, HBx accumulated in the cytoplasm leading to a proportional decrease of its nuclear fraction. These data indicate that compartmentalization of HBx is complex and may be influenced by its level of expression. In our study, the fusion of GFP did not affect HBx-mediated effects on transcriptional transactivation or anti-TGF-β-induced apoptosis, but greatly increased the half-life of HBx (data not shown). Systemic subcellular fractionation indicated that HBx-GFP distributed not only in the nucleus, cytosol, and organelles such as mitochondria but also in the periplasmic membrane, albeit at a very low level (Fig. 5). Since HBx did not possess a membrane-targeting signal, the nature of this association might be through the interaction with membrane-bound proteins. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these phenomena might occur only when HBx-GFP is overexpressed. The biological significance of the association remains to be investigated. The intracellular distribution of HBx has not been considered adequately in explorations of its biological role, and it is still difficult to relate its expression patterns with proposed functions. We applied artificial methods to recruit HBx to the nucleus by nuclear localization signal (NLS) tagging or to the periplasmic membrane by prenylation signal tagging to investigate the functional sites of HBx involved in mediating Src activation. Neither nucleus-targeted nor periplasmic membrane-targeted HBx-GFP fusion proteins were able to activate Src (Fig. 7). Cyclosporin A (CsA), which could disrupt mitochondrial calcium signaling (49Calpham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar), prevents HBx activation of Pyk2 (48Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Schneider R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). CGP37157, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial sodium-calcium pump (50Baron K.T. Thayer S.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 340: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), abolishes HBx-mediated Src activation of HBV DNA replication (48Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Schneider R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). These data suggest that HBx acts on mitochondria calcium control. Since a large proportion (about 1/3) of HBx-GFP fusion proteins were found to be associated with heavy membrane fraction (Fig. 5), it is tempting to speculate that heavy membrane associated HBx might influence the activation of Src through the regulation of Ca+2 release from these organelles."

A clue to the mechanism is given by our finding that heat shock leads to intracellular accumulation of heavy metals. We propose that the known anti-apoptotic effect of heat shock proteins allows for cell survival despite heavy metal accumulation and, consequently, results in a hyperactivation of the metal response pathway.

The best characterized target genes of MTF-1 are those encoding metallothioneins (MTs), a family of small, cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins with roles in heavy metal detoxification and homeostasis of heavy metals, radical scavenging, and maintenance of cellular redox state (4Vasak M.

The expression of metallothioneins can be induced by a variety of physiological and environmental stresses such as heavy metals, oxidizing agents, hypoxia, phorbol esters, ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, glucocorticoid hormones, and infectious agents. MTF-1 activates metallothionein gene expression through MRE (metal response element) sequences of core consensus TGCRCNC; multiple MREs are present in the promoter regions of MT-I and MT-II genes (1Lichtlen P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In resting cells, MTF-1 resides in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus in response to heavy metal exposure (9Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Heat is another important stress condition that elevates, through HSF1, transcription of the genes for heat shock proteins (Hsps), which can maintain/restore cellular protein functions via chaperone activity (12Nollen E.A.

Moreover, some Hsps, notably Hsp70, have been shown to protect cells against apoptosis (19Wei Y.Q. Zhao X. Kariya Y. Teshigawara K. Uchida A. Cancer Immunol.

Conversely, in several species, cadmium induces heat shock genes as well as metallothionein genes (25Lee M.J. Nishio H. Ayaki H. Yamamoto M. Sumino K.

In mammalian cells, heat shock-induced nuclear translocation of MTF-1 has been shown to be insufficient to activate transcription from a metallothionein gene promoter (11Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F. Schaffner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we could not find any heat shock element (HSE) consensus sequence in the mouse metallothionein gene promoter. In this study, we report that a metallothionein promoter is hyperactivated in an MTF-1-dependent manner by a combined exposure to heat and heavy metals. This induction is associated with an accumulation of heavy metals in the cell during heat exposure. Unlike a similar hyperactivation of the heat shock 70 gene promoter by heat and cadmium where heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 plays a crucial role, HSF-1 is apparently not required for metallothionein promoter activation. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—HEK293 (adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney) cells and HeLa (cervix carcinoma) cells were used for transient transfections. Reporter genes consisted of the firefly luciferase coding sequence driven either by a mouse metallothionein I promoter, a synthetic 4xMREd/TATA box promoter, or by the mouse Hsp70 promoter (kindly provided by Olivier Bensaude). References were β-galactosidase (CMV-LacZ) or Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV) genes under the control of the ubiquitously active CMV promoter. Reporter and reference genes were transfected into cells by the calcium phosphate method (28Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6485) Google Scholar). 36 h post-transfection, cells were exposed to heat shock at 43 °C during the indicated time periods. Heavy metals, H2O2, serum, low pH (6.0), and cycloheximide were administered to the culture either during heat shock at 43 °C or at 37 °C as indicated. After heat treatments, cells were transferred to 37 °C and incubated for another 3 h to allow for the recovery of the reporter protein, luciferase (29Michels A.A. Kanon B. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H.

Cells were harvested and analyzed by measuring luciferase activities according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). Firefly luciferase units were normalized to either β-galactosidase values or Renilla luciferase values (30Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates/J.

After a 3-h recovery period of cells at 37 °C, nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3913) Google Scholar). 30 μg of nuclear extracts was loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using Transblot-SD Semi-dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Before blocking, the membrane was stained with Ponceau to verify the amount of proteins loaded into each well. Before incubation with the primary antibody, the membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk, 0.5% Tween 20 in 1× PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with mouse anti-VSV antibody (1:10,000, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times for 10 min each with washing buffer (0.5% Tween 20 in 1× PBS), the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody, anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled (1:10,000, Vector Laboratories) in a buffer containing 2.5% nonfat milk, 0.5% Tween 20 in 1× PBS. After three washes of 15 min each, the horseradish peroxidase signal was detected using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Heavy Metal Determination in Cell Extracts—HEK293 cells were treated with 100 μm zinc or 60 μm cadmium (final concentration in DMEM culture medium containing 5% fetal calf serum), and left either at 37 °C or 42 °C for 1 h. The cells were scraped off with 5 ml of PBS ultra pure (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4,2mm KH2PO4). A total of 1 ml of cell suspension was diluted with 1 ml of 65% HNO3. All samples were microwave-digested (MLS Ethos 900, MLS, Leutkirch, Germany) at 210 °C and subsequently diluted with Milli Q water up to 10 ml before inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICN-MS) analysis. For analysis of metal concentrations, ICP-MS was performed using a HP4500 Series 300 ShieldTorch System instrument (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) in peak-hopping mode with a spacing at 0.05 atomic mass unit, 3 points/peak, 3 scans/sample, and an integration time of 300 ms/point. The rate of plasma flow was 15.5 liters/min with an auxiliary flow of 1.0 liter/min. The radio frequency power was 1.18 kilowatts. The samples were introduced using a cross-flow nebulizer at a flow rate of 1.02 liter/min. The apparatus was calibrated using a 6.5% HNO3 multielement solution containing Cu2+ (1.95, 3.9, 19.5, 39, 97.5, and 195 ppb), Zn2+ (2, 4, 20, 40, 100, and 200 ppb), and Cd2+ (1.82, 3.64, 18.2, 36.4, 91, and 182 ppb) with 103Rh, the internal standard for all isotopes of Cu, Zn, and Cd. The transport of MTF-1 to the nucleus is induced not only by treatment with zinc and cadmium but also by a number of other stress conditions (11Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F. Schaffner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which led us to test whether any of these could synergize with heavy metal induction. A luciferase reporter gene driven by a natural mouse metallothionein-I promoter or a synthetic metal-responsive promoter with four copies of the MREd sequence (“4xMREd”) was tested in HEK293 cells. Although heat shock alone did not induce reporter gene transcription, strong synergistic activation of the 4xMREd promoter was observed with zinc (34-fold versus 3-fold with metal alone) and even more pronounced with cadmium (85-fold versus 1.6-fold) in the synthetic MTF-1-dependent promoter (Fig. 1A). A less pronounced but still impressive synergy was observed at the natural metallothionein promoter with zinc (8.7× versus 1.9×) and with cadmium (9.1× versus 2.5×) (Fig. 1B). By contrast, none of the other stress conditions, including hydrogen peroxide, low extracellular pH, and cycloheximide, or a high serum concentration, acted in synergy with heavy metal treatment; in some cases metal inducibility was even reduced (Fig. 1A). The synergistic activation of the MTF-1-dependent 4xMREd promoter by heat and heavy metal load was also observed in another human cell line (HeLa) (data not shown). To test whether the strong activation observed was perhaps a peculiarity of the luciferase reporter system, we repeated the experiment in HEK293 cells with the established OVEC reporter that measures RNA levels directly (34Westin G. Gerster T. Muller M.M. Schaffner G. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6787-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Again there was a clear synergy of heavy metal and heat shock treatment, particularly evident with cadmium (8-fold instead of 1.8-fold with zinc, and 52-fold instead of 1.4-fold with cadmium; Fig. 2A). One possible explanation for this boost of activity might have been an increased accumulation of MTF-1 in the nucleus upon a combined heat/metal treatment. This was, however, not the case; the amount of MTF-1 that became associated with nuclear structures was the same with both metals irrespective of heat shock (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Synthetic metal-responsive promoter (4xMREd) is activated by heat shock/heavy metal treatment at the transcriptional level. 4xMREd-OVEC and CMV-OVEC-ref constructs were transfected into 293 cells. 36 h after transfection, cells were simultaneously treated with heavy metals and heat (43 °C) as indicated in the concentrations and time course. Cells were then collected and transcripts analyzed by S1 nuclease mapping. ct, correct transcripts of reporter gene; ref, reference gene transcripts. The basal level was taken as 1 to calculate the -fold activation (A). 293 cells transfected with a VSV-tagged MTF-1 expression vector were treated with heat (42 °C, 1.5 h) and heavy metals as above. After3hof recovery at 37 °C, nuclear extracts were prepared, and Western blot was performed. VSV-tagged MTF-1 was detected by anti-VSV antibody (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we considered the possibility that the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the major transcription factor involved in the heat shock response, was directly or indirectly participating in this synergy effect. HSF1 is conserved from yeast to humans and binds to so-called heat shock elements (HSEs) of consensus sequence nGAAnnTTCn (35Bienz M. Pelham H.R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Unlike the situation in yeast, where heat shock activates metallothionein (CUP1) expression via a heat shock response element, there are no obvious binding sites for HSF-1 in the mouse metallothionein-1 promoter, let alone the synthetic 4xMREd promoter; however, an indirect effect seemed also possible, e.g. with a cofactor-like binding of HSF-1 to MTF-1, rather than to DNA. To test this possibility, we cotransfected an expression plasmid for HSF1 together with the 4xMREd promoter. The effect of HSF1 on this promoter was at most marginal (Fig. 3). By contrast, activity of an Hsp70 promoter was strongly boosted by the combination of HSF1 and heavy metal (Fig. 4). (The poor inducibility by heat without transfected HSF1 can be explained by the relatively high basal activity of the Hsp70 promoter in HEK293 cells (39Williams G.T. McClanahan T.K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2574-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).)Fig. 4Expression of the Hsp70 promoter by cadmium and heat in presence or absence of HSF1. HEK293 cells were transfected with the Hsp70-Luc promoter-reporter construct, the CMV-LacZ reference construct, and the mouse HSF1 expression vector. 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 μm zinc chloride or 60 μm cadmium chloride with or without heat shock at 43 °C for 1 h. Cells were collected, and reporter gene activities were determined by luciferase assay. The basal level was taken as 1 to calculate the -fold activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From this data it still seems possible that, if not HSF-1 itself, at least some heat shock proteins might be involved in the hyperactivation of the 4xMREd promoter. Chaperones are known to facilitate formation of some transcriptional regulatory complexes, which in turn activate or repress transcription from certain promoters (40Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L.

Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Neckers L. Liu Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10519-10526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). First, to test if Hsp90 is involved in the transcriptional activation of MTF-1, we treated HepG2 cells with geldanamycin, which specifically blocks the ATP binding cassette of Hsp90 and thereby abolishes its chaperone activity (46Kang K.I. Meng X. Devin-Leclerc J. Bouhouche I. Chadli A. Cadepond F. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1439-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In our case, however, neither the transcriptional activity nor the nuclear translocation of MTF-1 was affected by geldanamycin (data not shown). In contrast to the role of chaperones in assisting the formation of transcription complexes, recent studies by Freeman and Yamamoto indicate that some chaperones, notably p23 and Hsp90, can interfere with transcription by disassembling regulatory complexes; this was revealed by tethering chaperone-Gal4 fusion proteins to a reporter promoter (47Freeman B.C. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 2002; 296: 2232-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Along this vein of thought, it could be argued that, upon heat shock, such interfering hsps are titrated by unfolded proteins, which would boost the transcriptional response of some promoters. To test whether the molecular chaperones p23, Hsp90, and Hsp70 mediate disassembly of the MTF-1-containing transcriptional complexes, each of these proteins was fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and tested on a luciferase gene driven by three Gal4 binding sites followed by four metal response elements (MREd). However, neither Gal4-p23, Gal4-Hsp90, nor Gal4-Hsp70 significantly affected basal or heat/heavy metal-stimulated levels of transcription from this reporter gene (data not shown). Because we could not observe any involvement of the key proteins of the heat shock response in the synergistic activation of MTF-1, we considered the possibility that MTF-1 was the principal effector of transcriptional activation, whereas heat shock somehow altered the cellular handling of heavy metals. This indeed appears to be the case, because determination of zinc and cadmium concentrations in HEK293 cells shows that heat stimulates the intracellular accumulation of these metals (Fig. 5). Recent work from our laboratory pointed to a relationship between MTF-1 and heat shock stress: not only heavy metals but also heat causes the translocation of MTF-1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Other conditions tested, such as low pH (6.0), H2O2, and high serum concentration, were also found to induce, at least to some extent, this translocation. However, none of these other conditions was able per se to activate MTF-1-dependent transcription under our assay conditions (11Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F. Schaffner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25487-25495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we show that heat shock is ineffective by itself, but heat and heavy metals can synergize to hyperactivate metal-inducible promoters. A straightforward explanation for this effect, cooperative action of MTF-1 and heat shock transcription factor (HSF1), was ruled out. Unlike the mouse Hsp70 promoter, which is also synergistically activated by heat and cadmium and where transfected HSF1 potentiates the effect, the presence or absence of HSF1 had no influence on the 4xMREd promoter. Because zinc is the main physiological inducer of MTF-1 in mammalian cells, one could simply postulate that heat shock triggers a zinc release from cellular zinc stores, which in turn binds to MTF-1 allowing it to activate its target genes. However, zinc liberated by heat shock alone would be expected to activate MTF-1, which is not the case: transcription is only induced when exogenous zinc or cadmium is provided during heat shock. Interestingly, relatively low concentrations of these heavy metals, which by themselves hardly induce transcription, are sufficient for synergistic activation. We find that the amount of MTF-1 associated with nuclear structures is not increased by heat/metal treatment versus metal alone (Fig. 2B). Alterations in the phosphorylation state of MTF-1 have been invoked in the process of transcriptional induction (48LaRochelle O. Gagne V. Charron J. Soh J.W. Seguin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41879-41888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 49Saydam N. Adams T.K. Steiner F. Schaffner W. Freedman J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20438-20445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is unknown at present whether heat treatment results in additional modifications of MTF-1 and/or of a putative cofactor that remains to be identified. Taken together, the hyperactivation of the metallothionein promoter by heat and metal is best explained by the propensity of cells to accumulate heavy metal under heat shock. Indeed we find that at a given heavy metal concentration in the culture medium, heat shock resulted in 2.5- and 2.3-fold higher intracellular concentrations of zinc and cadmium, respectively. However, our attempts to achieve the same high level of activation by merely increasing extracellular heavy metal concentration at 37 °C were unsuccessful, invariably resulting in massive cell death (not shown). This finding of course raises the question why the cells did not die in the combination of metal and heat shock. It is well-documented that heat shock proteins, notably Hsp70, exert a strong anti-apoptotic effect (13Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that heat treatment not only results in heavy metal accumulation but also allows for survival at intracellular metal concentrations that could not be tolerated otherwise. Although cadmium is not a physiological trace element, zinc is essential for proper functioning of the immune system (50Rink L. Kirchner H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1407S-1411SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is tempting to speculate that fever, a natural heat shock condition (51Hasday J.D. Singh I.S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), contributes to the defense against infectious agents by promoting zinc uptake, among other effects.

https://openalex.org/W2065414469,"Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains are phosphothreonine-binding modules prevalent in proteins with important cell cycle and DNA damage response functions. The yeast checkpoint kinase Rad53 is unique in containing two FHA domains. We have generated novel recessive rad53 alleles with abolished FHA domain functions resulting from Ala substitution of the critical phosphothreonine-binding residues Arg70 and Arg605. In asynchronous cells, inactivation of the N-terminal FHA1 domain did not impair Rad53 activation and downstream functions, whereas inactivation of the C-terminal FHA2 domain led to reduced Rad53 activation and significantly increased DNA damage sensitivity. Simultaneous inactivation of both FHA domains abolished Rad53 activation and all downstream functions and dramatically increased the sensitivity to DNA damage and replication blocks similar to kinase-defective and rad53 null alleles, but did not compromise the essential viability function of Rad53. Interestingly, in G2/M synchronized cells, mutation of either FHA domain prevented Rad53 activation and impaired the cell cycle arrest checkpoint. Our data demonstrate that both FHA domains are required for normal Rad53 functions and indicate that the two FHA domains have differential but partially overlapping roles in Rad53 activation and downstream signaling."

Since thrombin can effect a variety of procoagulant, anticoagulant, antifibrinolytic, or cellular responses depending on the local environment, fII activation has been extensively studied. fII is converted to α-thrombin by proteolytic cleavages at Arg-271–Thr-272 and at Arg-320–Ile-321 (2Rosing J.

Assembly of the prothrombinase complex results in a 278,000-fold enhancement in the rate of fII activation as compared with fXa alone (5Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). fVa functions both as a K-type and a V-type effector in the reaction, decreasing the Km and increasing the k cat, respectively. Additionally, in the presence of fVa and phospholipids, fII activation proceeds almost exclusively via a meizothrombin intermediate (initial cleavage at Arg-320), whereas in the absence of these two components, the activation proceeds via a prethrombin 2 intermediate (initial cleavage at Arg-271) (2Rosing J.

Therefore, the substrate specificity of fXa is altered in the presence of fVa and phospholipids. fXa bears extensive structural and sequential homology to other vitamin K-dependent serine proteases (10Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The mature glycoprotein circulates in plasma as two chains connected by a single disulfide linkage. The N-terminal region of the light chain is rich in post-translationally modified γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues and hence is termed the Gla domain. The Gla domain is followed by two domains that bear structural similarity to epidermal growth factor (epidermal growth factor-like repeats). The heavy chain of fXa contains the serine protease domain. The heavy chain of fXa is highly homologous to other serine proteases such as thrombin, chymotrypsin, and activated protein C, and six variable regions and seven conserved regions have been identified (11Furie B.

Chem. 1982; 257: 3875-3882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). fII also belongs to the vitamin K-dependent protein family and hence has a Gla domain (residues 1–40) that is homologous to fXa Gla domain (10Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). However, instead of the two epidermal growth factor-like repeats in fXa, fII has two kringle domains (residues 41–155 and 156–271, respectively) followed by the serine protease domain (residues 272–579). Identifying functionally important amino acid sequences that mediate protein-protein interaction is a central problem in biochemistry. For the prothrombinase complex, some progress has been made although the picture is still very incomplete. For example, of the 139 amino acids in the light chain of fXa, a few of the amino acids seem to be critical in the fXa-fVa interaction. Gla domainless-fXa shows impaired binding to fVa and phospholipid-bound fVa (12Morita T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4015-4023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Skogen W.F.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2453-2458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the second epidermal growth factor repeat in fXa may also bind fVa, albeit weakly (14Persson E. Valcarce C. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2453-2458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hertzberg M.S. Ben-Tal O. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14759-14766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the heavy chain of fXa, amino acids 211–222 (CHT32–44) and 254–274 (CHT74–94) in the variable region 1 and 2, respectively, of the catalytic domain of fXa may be involved in fVa binding (16Chattopadhyay A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22037-22045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas amino acids representing the regions 275–287 (CHT95–107) and 415–425 (CHT241–252C) were suggested to play a key role in substrate recognition (16Chattopadhyay A. James H.L. Fair D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12323-12329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another study using an exosite-directed antibody, overlapping regions, namely amino acids 262–271 (CHT82–91) and 282–296 (CHT102–116), were suggested to be critical for substrate recognition (18Wilkens M. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9366-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Arg-347 (CHTArg165) and the autolysis loop might contribute to the interaction of fXa with fVa (17Sabharwal A.K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Mathur A. Gorka J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5123-5128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As in fXa, several fVa binding loci seem likely to exist on fII. Both fII kringle domains have been reported to interact with fVa (21Kotkow K.J. Deitcher S.R. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol.

Based on the homology of protein C with fXa and fII (28Plutzky J. Hoskins J.A. Long G.L. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins. 1990; 7: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we used synthetic peptides comprising related sequences in fXa and fII to test their ability to inhibit assembly of the prothrombinase complex. Here, we identified distinct sequences in fXa and fII that are essential for interactions with each other and with their fVa cofactor. Materials—Human fII was isolated as reported previously (31Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 355-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a molecular weight of 72,000 daltons and an extinction coefficient (ϵ280cm1mg/ml ) of 1.44 (32Francis R.T. McDonagh J. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9787-9792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments, purified human fVa was obtained as a gift from Drs. Guido Tans and Jan Rosing (University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands) (33Tans G. Rosing J. Thomassen M.C. Heeb M.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1991; 77: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For other experiments, fVa was purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Human thrombin and human fXa were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN), and the molar concentrations were determined by active site titration as described (34Chase T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). All proteins appeared to be >95% purity judged by SDS-PAGE. The chromogenic substrates S-2222 and S-2238 were purchased from Kabi-Vitrum (Franklin, OH), and CBS 34–47 was purchased from Diagnostica Stago Inc. (Parsippany, NJ). Rabbit brain cephalin was obtained from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin, human fibrinogen, and d-Phenylalalyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl (FPR) chloromethylketone were purchased from Calbiochem, and normal human citrate-anticoagulated plasma (NHP) was obtained from George King BioMedical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS). Fluorescein-labeled fXa (Fl-fXai) was prepared as described (35Yegneswaran S. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 485-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles were made as described (36Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using synthetic dioleolyphosphatidylcholine (PC) and dioleolyphosphatidylserine (PS) purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). l-3-Phosphatidylcholine-1, 2-di [1-14C]oleoyl PC was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Peptide Synthesis and Characterization—Fifteen-amino-acid-long synthetic peptides were prepared, purified to homogeneity using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized as described earlier (25Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some control experiments, scrambled peptides were obtained from Bio Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Mass spectroscopic analyses of the purified peptides using the previously reported method yielded, in each case, the exact expected molecular weight for each individual peptide. Solutions of each peptide were prepared, and the concentrations were determined as described (25Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). fXa-1 Stage Coagulation Assay—Peptides were screened for effects on fXa coagulant activity using an fXa-1 stage coagulation assays and NHP as described previously (25Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit brain cephalin (100 μl at 200 μg/ml) was preincubated with 100 μl of NHP or factor VIIIa-deficient plasma for 200 s at 37 °C. Coagulation was then initiated by the addition of fXa (200 μl at 0.31 nm in 50 mm Tris/HCL (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% BSA, 0.02% NaN3 (TBS-BSA) plus 15 mm CaCl2) that had been preincubated for 10 min with the peptide of interest at 37 °C. The residual fXa clotting activity in the presence of each different peptide concentration was calculated from a standard curve derived from the double-logarithmic plot of clotting time versus fXa. fXa and Thrombin Amidolytic Assays—Amidolytic activities of fXa and thrombin toward their respective peptide chromogenic substrates S-2222, CBS 34–47, and S-2238 were assayed (25Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the effect of synthetic peptides on amidolytic activity was determined. The peptide of interest (0–350 μm) was incubated with the enzyme (typically 5–10 nm) in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.5% BSA for 10 min at room temperature. Then the activity of the enzyme toward its respective chromogenic substrate was assayed at six different substrate concentrations (ranging between 0 and 2 mm) using an OPTIMAX tunable microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Fibrinogen Clotting—Human thrombin (0.5 units/ml) was preincubated with the peptide of interest (0–1 mm) at five different concentrations in 200 μl of buffer containing TBS-BSA plus 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C in polystyrene cuvettes. Clotting was initiated by addition of 200 μl of human fibrinogen (5 mg/ml) in TBS-BSA plus 2.5 mm CaCl2, and time in seconds from addition of fibrinogen to clot formation was measured using an Electra 700 automatic coagulation timer (Medical Laboratory Automation, Inc., Mount Vernon, NY). Prothrombinase Assay—fII activation was measured in a two-stage assay (25Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step involved the generation of thrombin, which was subsequently measured in the second step using a chromogenic substrate S-2238 or CBS 34–47. Amounts of fXa, phospholipids, and fII present in the assay were such that the rate of thrombin generation was linearly proportional to the amount of fVa present in the reaction mixture. In a typical experiment, the peptide of interest was preincubated with fVa (0.4 nm final) in TBS-BSA plus 2 mm CaCl2 for 20 min at 22 °C. After preincubation, an aliquot of this solution was added to a solution containing fII (1.2 μm final) and PC/PS vesicles (50 μm final) in TBS-BSA plus 2 mm CaCl2. Thrombin generation was initiated by the addition of fXa (1 nm). To measure the amount of thrombin generated, a 20-μl aliquot of the activation mixture was withdrawn every minute and quenched into 80 μl of buffer containing TBS-BSA plus 10 mm EDTA. Finally, the amount of thrombin present was quantified by adding 50 μl of 2 mm S-2238, and rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm for 2.5 min. The change in A 405 was directly proportional to the thrombin generation. For the assays performed in the absence of fVa, the protocols were the same except that the synthetic peptides were preincubated with fII before thrombin generation was initiated by the addition of fXa. For some kinetic studies, a modified prothrombinase assay was used to conserve reagents. Briefly, different concentrations of fII (ranging from 0 to 6.5 μm) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.5% BSA, and 0.02% NaN3 were incubated with PC/PS (25 μm) and fVa (114 pm) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of the peptide of interest at room temperature for 10 min in a total volume of 35 μl. fII activation was initiated with 10 μl of fXa (320 pm) in the same buffer. After 2.5 min, the reaction was quenched with 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA. Thrombin generated was estimated by using CBS 34–47 (50 μl, 1.3 mm), and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm for 5 min. The change in A 405 was directly proportional to the thrombin generation. For fII activation without fVa, different concentrations of fII (ranging from 0 to 1.2 μm) in 150 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% BSA were incubated with PC/PS (25 μm) in the presence or absence of the peptide of interest for 10 min at room temperature. fII activation was then initiated with fXa (7.5 nm). Aliquots (15 μl) were withdrawn at 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 min, and the reaction was quenched in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA. Finally, the amount of thrombin generated was quantified using 50 μl of CBS 34–47 (1.5 mm) as described before. Spectral Measurements—Steady state fluorescence intensity and anisotropy measurements were made using a SLM AB2 Luminescence spectrometer (SLM Aminco, Rochester, NY) equipped with a 150-watt xenon arc lamp, two holographic gratings in the excitation light path, and an IBM computer for data analysis. Fluorescein fluorescence was detected at its excitation and emission maxima wavelengths at 490 and 525 nm, respectively, using a 345-nm cut-off filter (Schott Glass Technology, Duryea, PA) in the excitation beam path. Shutters were closed except during measurements to minimize photodegradation of samples. A circulating water bath was used to maintain the sample compartment at 25 °C. All fluorescence experiments were performed in 5 × 5 mm quartz cuvettes. Samples were mixed using a small teflon-coated 2 × 2 mm magnetic spinbar as described (37Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dell V.A. Miller D.L. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry,. 1990; 29: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Absorption of protein to the cuvette walls was minimized by coating the cuvettes with 100% PC vesicles as described (39Ye J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a typical fluorescence experiment, two samples were prepared in parallel. The sample cuvette received 200 nm Fl-fXai in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, whereas the blank cuvette received an equal concentration of unlabeled active site inhibited FFR-fXai in the same buffer. The initial net fluorescence intensity of the sample, designated Fo , was obtained by the subtraction of a dye-free blank cuvette from the sample cuvette signal. For the peptide titrations, equimolar concentrations of peptides were added to each cuvette. The signal of the blank cuvette was never greater than 0.2% of the sample cuvette. After the signal observed in the absence of the dye (sample B) was subtracted from that in the presence of the dye (sample A), the net volume-corrected signal was designated F at that point in the titration. Phospholipid and protein titrations in the presence or absence of peptides were performed analogously. Steady state anisotropy was measured using Glan-Thompson prism polarizers on both the excitation and emission beams. The emission intensity measured when the sample was excited by vertically (V) plane-polarized light and the emission was detected through a horizontal (H) polarizer is termed IVH. IHH, IHV, and IVV are defined analogously. The component intensities of a dye-free blank were subtracted from the component sample intensities to give the net emission intensities. Anisotropy (r) was then calculated from the net intensities using r = (Ivv – GIHV)/(Ivv + 2GIVH), where the grating factor, G, equals IHV/IHH. Curve Fitting and Data Analysis—The curves obtained from the fluorescence assays were fit using GraphPad Prism Version 3.03 using procedures similar to those described earlier (40Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6210-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximum theoretical change in fluorescence parameter obtained for each titration (F max) was then used to normalize all curves to 100% maximum change. Inhibition of fXa-induced Clotting Activity by fII-derived and fXa-derived Peptides— Table I illustrates homology between functionally important sequences in protein C comprising residues 390–404 (25Mesters R.M. Houghten R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24514-24519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and residues 142–155 (27Mesters R.M. Heeb M.J. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12656-12663Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and sequences in fXa (41Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofstenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and fII (42Degen S.J.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides of fII and fXa derived from these regions of homology were screened for their ability to inhibit fXa clotting activity in normal human plasma. Table II shows the amino acid sequences that were assayed and the residual fXa activity observed in an fXa-1 stage clotting assay in the presence of 500 μm of each peptide. Three peptides, namely PT557–571, X404–418, and X415–429, inhibited more than 80% of fXa clotting activity at 500 μm peptide, whereas peptide PT294–306, which is homologous to amino acid stretch 142–155 of protein C, inhibited only about 25% of fXa activity.Table IAlignment of residues 390-404 and 142-155 in protein C with homologous sequences in fX and fIIProteinResiduesSequenceaBold and underlined letters indicate amino acids that are identical among Protein C, fX, and fII.Protein C390-404YG VYTKV SRYLDWI HFactor X409-423YG IYT KV TAFLKWI DProthrombin557-571YG FYT HV FRLKKWI QChymotrypsin225-239RG CNT RKKPVVYTRVProtein C142-155G.RP WKRMEKK RS H LProthrombin294-304G LRP LF..EKK.S.La Bold and underlined letters indicate amino acids that are identical among Protein C, fX, and fII.

Two of the three scrambled sequences did not show any significant inhibition in the fXa-1 stage assay, whereas the X415–429SCR, a scrambled sequence of amino acids 415–429 in fXa, showed ∼46% inhibition as compared with 93% inhibition by the native sequence (Table II). Thus, none of the scrambled sequences was as effective as PT557–571, X404–418, and X415–429 at inhibiting fXa-induced clotting, thus suggesting sequence specificity of these peptide in inhibiting fXa activity. In dose-response studies, PT557–571, X404–418, and X415–429 inhibited fXa clotting activity with 50% inhibition between 41 and 115 μm (Fig. 1). Inhibition of clotting by X415–429SCR was due to an artifactual inhibition because this peptide was found to inhibit clotting of fibrinogen by thrombin. None of the other peptides inhibited clotting of fibrinogen by thrombin (data not shown). fVa-dependent Inhibition of Prothrombinase by Peptide X404–418 —To characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of the three most anticoagulant peptides in a prothrombinase assay both in the presence and absence of fVa, studies were performed using purified proteins. Each peptide was tested for its ability to inhibit the generation of thrombin by fXa. Fig. 2 shows that peptide X404–418 dose-dependently inhibited prothrombinase activity in the presence of fVa with 50% inhibition at 83 μm. However, X404–418 did not significantly affect prothrombinase activity in the absence of fVa for the concentrations of peptide tested (Fig. 2). Thus, X404–418 absolutely required the presence of fVa to exert its inhibitory effect on prothrombinase activity. The control scrambled peptide, X404–418SCR, did not inhibit prothrombinase in either the presence or the absence of fVa (Fig. 2). Thus, the fVa-dependent inhibition of prothrombinase by X404–418 was sequence-specific. To further elucidate the mechanism of inhibition by X404–418, prothrombinase assays were performed at varying fII and X404–418 concentrations (Fig. 2 Inset). Plots of 1/fII against 1/velocity of reaction generated (Fig. 2, inset, Lineweaver-Burk plot) straight lines when X404–418 was not present or present in increasing concentrations. The inhibition pattern can be described as non-competitive inhibition. The plot of X404–418 concentration against the slope gave an estimated inhibition constant, Ki , value of 22 μm. fVa-independent Inhibition of Prothrombinase by Peptides PT557–571 and X415–429 —In contrast to the fVa-dependent effects of X404–418, PT557–571 and X415–429 exhibited similar dose-dependent inhibition of prothrombinase activity in the presence and in the absence of fVa (Fig. 3) with half-maximal effects between 25 and 50 μm peptide. Thus, the inhibition of fXa by PT557–571 and X415–429 was fVa-independent. Scrambled peptides PT557–571SCR and X415–429SCR did not significantly inhibit prothrombinase (Fig. 3), indicating that the inhibition of prothrombinase by PT557–571 and X415–429 was sequence-specific. When prothrombinase assays were performed at different fII and peptide concentrations and in the absence of fVa, PT557–571 showed an inhibition pattern si"
https://openalex.org/W1964900428,"RhoG is a new GTPase that has high sequence similarity with members of the Rac subfamily (Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3), including the regions involved in effector recognition and binding. To characterize its biological properties, we have compared the activity of RhoG and Rac1 in a number of experimental systems, including the study of their subcellular localization, oncogenic potential, activation of effectors, and effect on F-actin dynamics. Our study indicates that RhoG and Rac1 share overlapping, but not identical, signal transduction pathways. In contrast to previous results, we also provide evidence that RhoG works in parallel to Rac1 rather than as a Rac1 upstream activator. Using an extensive collection of Rho/Rac1 chimeras and point mutants, we demonstrate that the different biological properties of RhoG and Rac1 can be traced to specific amino acid variations in their switch I, β2/β3 hairpin, α5 helix, and C-terminal polybasic regions. Taken collectively, our results highlight the complexity of the signal transduction pathways activated by Rho/Rac GTPases and provide insight into the structural determinants that mediate the differential engagement of biological responses by GTPases of very similar structure.

The majority of these proteins are characterized by a common mechanism of activation during signal transduction (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). In non-stimulated cells, Rho/Rac proteins are maintained in an inactive state because of the presence of bound GDP molecules. After cell stimulation, they exchange GDP by GTP, an event inducing structural changes in their switch I and II regions that makes them competent for effector binding. At the end of the stimulation cycle, Rho/Rac GTPases become inactive again because of the hydrolysis of GTP to yield GDP. This cycle is regulated by GEFs 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanosine nucleotide exchange factor; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; GAP, GTPase activating protein; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PAK1, p21-associated kinase 1; WASP, Wiscott-Aldrich protein. and GAPs. GEFs accelerate the activation of the GTPases during cell stimulation by catalyzing the release of the bound GDP. By contrast, GAP catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP into GDP, therefore allowing the rapid inactivation of the GTPases at the end of the stimulation cycle (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). In addition to these regulatory molecules common to all GTP-binding proteins, Rho/Rac proteins utilize regulatory mechanisms that are different from other GTPase families. Thus, the expression of some Rho/Rac family members is inducible during cell stimulation or differentiation (i.e. Rac2 and RhoG) (3Li B. Yu H. Zheng W. Voll R. Na S. Roberts A.W. Williams D.A. Davis R.J. Ghosh S. Flavell R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 2219-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4Vincent S. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3138-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, most Rho/Rac proteins bind to negative regulatory molecules known as Rho GDIs. These proteins regulate the subcellular localization of Rho/Rac GTPases by extracting them from the plasma membrane and keeping them sequestered in the cytosol (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 5Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 6Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In addition, recent data suggest that GDIs may inhibit Rho/Rac signaling by removing effector molecules from the activated GTPase (7Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). One key biological function of Rho/Rac family members is the regulation of F-actin polymerization and cytoskeletal dynamics (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3874) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been shown that Rac1 promotes the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffling, that RhoA induces stress fibers and focal adhesions, and that Cdc42 is in charge of generating microspikes and filopodia in a number of cell types (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3874) Google Scholar). These proteins have also been linked to other cellular processes such as apoptosis/cell survival, immune functions, vesicle trafficking, tissue contractility, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional changes (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3874) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 8Bustelo X.R. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These activities are the result of the direct activation of different subsets of effector molecules, including adaptor proteins, actin polymerization/branching agents, and kinases of different substrate specificity (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3874) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 8Bustelo X.R. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The function of Rho/Rac-dependent pathways have also been associated with a number of human disorders such as cancer, hereditary immunodeficiencies, human immunodeficiency virus replication, X-linked mental retardation, deafness, and other developmental abnormalities (9Boettner B. Van Aelst L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These observations have fueled the interest for the functional characterization of all members of this GTPase family. RhoG is a new member of the Rho/Rac family that is still poorly characterized. This GTPase was initially discovered as a ubiquitously expressed immediate early gene that was induced by a number of extracellular stimuli such as serum, thrombin, and fibroblast growth factor (4Vincent S. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3138-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Later on, the activity of this GTPase has been linked to cytoskeletal changes and the abrogation of cell contact inhibition in fibroblasts (10Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma cells (11Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and axogenesis in primary sympathetic postganglionic neurons (12May V. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6980-6990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, RhoG has been linked to the stimulation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (13Vigorito E. Billadeu D.D. Savoy D. McAdam S. Doody G. Fort P. Turner M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 330-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a transcriptional factor important for the activation of genes encoding interleukin 2 and other cytokines (14Serfling E. Berberich-Siebelt F. Chuvpilo S. Jankevics E. Klein-Hessling S. Twardzik T. Avots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). One interesting property of RhoG is its close structural relationship with Rac1. These two GTPases share a 72% overall sequence identity and, perhaps more importantly, are very similar in the regions involved in effector binding, such as the switch I (92% sequence identity), the β2/β3 hairpin (75% sequence identity), and the switch II domain (89.5% sequence identity). This structural likeness suggests that these two proteins must utilize similar signal transduction pathways. However, one unexpected observation is that RhoG appears to act not in parallel but upstream of Rac1, allowing the activation of this GTPase during specific cellular responses (10Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A similar relationship has also been reported for RhoG and Cdc42 (10Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been shown that the constitutively active version of RhoG can induce the formation of membrane ruffles and filopodia that can be blocked in turn by the expression of dominant negative mutants for Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively (10Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that the RhoG-dependent neurite outgrowth can be eliminated by the expression of the same interfering mutants in rat pheochromocytoma cells (11Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although linear pathways of activation between different Rho/Rac GTPases have been previously described (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3874) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar), this is the first example of an activation of one GTPase by one closely related member of the same subfamily. The structural similarity of RhoG and Rac1 prompted us to investigate in detail their effector specificities and signaling relationships. To this end, we compared the biological properties of these two GTPases in a number of cellular responses, including subcellular localization, activation of signaling pathways, and oncogenesis. Moreover, we have used two independent techniques to verify the upstream position of RhoG over Rac1 in signal transduction. The results obtained indicate that RhoG and Rac1 act in non-linear, parallel pathways that share overlapping, but not identical, signaling elements. Specifically, we found that RhoG and Rac can promote JNK activation and induce similar changes in the F-actin cytoskeleton. However, they differ in subcellular localization, ability to bind PAK1, and transforming activity. To understand in detail the structural basis that allows the engagement of separate signaling elements by these two GTPases, we used an extensive collection of chimeric proteins in which specific fragments of Rac1 were swapped by the equivalent regions of RhoG. In addition, we utilized point mutants that targeted divergent residues between these two GTPase in the regions presumably involved in assuring substrate selectivity. All these mutant proteins were tested in PAK1 binding, cellular transformation, and subcellular localization. Our results indicate that amino acid residues within the switch I, β2/β3 hairpin, α5, and hypervariable region of RhoG and Rac1 are involved in the differential engagement of those cellular responses. Expression Vectors—All RhoG and Rac1 point mutants described in this work were generated using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RhoGQ61L/Rac1 chimeric cDNAs were generated by PCR using the Elongase polymerase (Invitrogen) following a previously described protocol (15Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequences and protocols for generating each specific chimera are available upon request. The pGEX vector containing the PAK1 CRIB domain was provided by Dr. R. Cerione (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The GST-PAK1 CRIB domain was expressed in Escherichia coli according to standard procedures (16Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors encoding different versions of RhoG, Rac1, H-Ras, Cdc42, Vav(Δ1–66), RhoA, and H-Ras have been previously described (17Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 18Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Tissue Culture Conditions—All cell types were cultured at 37 °C and an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on uncoated glass coverslips introduced into six-well plates (50,000 cells/plate) and transfected with 1 μg of the indicated plasmids for 30 h using liposomes (FuGENE 6, Roche Diagnostics), as described previously (18Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Cells were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, permeabilized by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked for 10 min in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 25 mm Tris-buffered solution. Cells were incubated with anti-AU5 antibodies (Babco) (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h and then incubated with a anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to Cy2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) (1:200 dilution) for 45 min. For staining the F-actin cytoskeleton, cells were incubated with rhodaminephalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 20 min (18Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). After three washes in 25 mm Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using a standard mounting medium (Slowfade, Molecular Probes). Antibody dilutions were made in blocking solution. All steps were conducted at room temperature. Fluorescence images were captured with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Fluorochromes were excited using an 18Ar laser (488 nm excitation-wavelength) for Cy2 and a 2He/10Ne laser (543 nm excitation wavelength) for both Cy3 and rhodamine. Focus Formation Assays—NIH3T3 cells (150,000 cells/10-cm plate) were transfected with 20 μg of high molecular weight calf thymus DNA (Roche Diagnostics) and the indicated plasmids using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (19van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). After 24 h, DNA/calcium phosphate precipitates were removed by two washes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum for 15 days. After this period, cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with Giemsa to count the foci of transformed cells. All transfections were done in duplicate. GST Pull-down and Kinase Assays—COS1 cells growing in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of the indicated constructs using the DEAE-dextran method (20Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were washed on ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and then disrupted in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, a protease-inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 μg of the GST-PAK1 CRIB domain fusion protein. Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer without GST-PAK1 CRIB domain and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer to release the bound proteins. Eluates were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to the AU5 epitope (Babco). Immunocomplexes and pulled down proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence techniques using a commercial kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). JNK immunocomplex assays were done as described (20Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar), using a GST-ATF2 fusion protein as phosphate acceptor. Hemagglutinin antibodies used in the immunocomplex assays were from Babco. Informatics—Confocal image analysis was carried out with the LSM 5 Image Browser program (version 2.8). Protein tertiary structures were elaborated using the Cn3D 4.0 program. RhoG and Rac1 Have Overlapping, but Not Identical, Signaling Pathways—To compare the signaling specificities of RhoG and Rac1, we studied their respective activities in four different biological assays. First, we analyzed their subcellular localization and their effects on the F-actin cytoskeleton in COS1 and NIH3T3 cells. As previously described (21Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar), the constitutively active version of Rac1 (Q61L mutant) induces robust membrane ruffling in COS1 cells, showing a preferential subcellular localization in plasma membrane and membrane ruffles (Fig. 1A). A small fraction of Rac1Q61L was also detected in the cytosol (Fig. 1A). Wild type Rac1 induced no detectable morphological change and displayed a uniform distribution in the cytosol (Fig. 1A), a result consistent with its high GDP content and its constitutive association with Rho GDIs (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1) (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Wild type RhoG showed identical distribution as that of Rac1 in COS1 cells (Fig. 1A). However, RhoGQ61L was localized in intracellular vesicles and, unlike Rac1Q61L, was totally absent from the plasma membrane and ruffles (Fig. 1A). The differential localization of RhoG and RhoGQ61L correlated with their differential binding to Rho GDI (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1), as previously described for other Rho/Rac GTPases (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The RhoG-containing vesicles are from endocytic origins, because they co-localize with internalized epidermal growth factor receptor. 2R. M. Prieto-Sánchez and X. R. Bustelo, manuscript in preparation. In contrast to previous reports (22Vignal E. Blangy A. Martin M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fort P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8022-8034Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), no association of RhoGQ61L could be found with the endoplasmic reticulum or lysosomes. Despite the differential localization of the activated forms of RhoG and Rac1, both induced strong membrane ruffling when expressed in COS1 cells (Fig. 1A). When tested in murine fibroblasts, Rac1Q61L and RhoGQ61L induced extensive lamellipodia in the cell periphery (Fig. 1B). In the case of Rac1, this phenotype was associated with the formation of a perinuclear actomyosin ring (Fig. 1B). This morphological phenotype was similar to that induced by the Vav oncoprotein (Fig. 1B), a well known Rac1/RhoG activator (23Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 24Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). RhoGQ61L-expressing cells lacked this contractile structure and, instead, displayed a continuous membrane ruffle around the cell periphery. In contrast to previous results (10Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), no filopodia were found in RhoGQ61L-expressing cells (Fig. 1, A and B). For the sake of comparison, we found that RhoAQ63L induced cell rounding and Cdc42Q61L promoted extensive filopodia formation when expressed in the same cell context (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that, despite their different subcellular localizations, RhoG and Rac1 induce similar morphological phenotypes. Next, we analyzed the transforming potential of these GTPases when transfected into mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells). Rac1Q61L induces cellular transformation in this system (approximately 1.4–3.0 × 103 foci μg-1 of transfected DNA) (Fig. 1C). This transformation is characterized by the generation of foci of transformed cells of very small size (Fig. 1C). In contrast, RhoGQ61L does not induce cell transformation under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 1C). The lack of transforming activity of RhoGQ61L is not because of lack of GDP/GTP cycling, because a fast cycling mutant of RhoG (F28L) also lacked transforming activity (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S2) (25Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23633-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The wild type versions of Rac1 and RhoG showed no transforming activity even at saturating concentrations of transfected DNA. 3R. M. Prieto-Sánchez and X. R. Bustelo, unpublished data. Finally, we compared the activity of RhoG and Rac1 toward two specific Rac1 downstream elements, the serine/threonine kinases PAK1 and JNK (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Because the activation of PAK1 is mediated by the physical interaction with their upstream GTPases, we measured the PAK1 binding activity of Rac1 and RhoG proteins using pull-down experiments with the GST-PAK1 CRIB domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1D (left panel), RhoGQ61L could not bind to PAK1 in conditions under which the constitutively active version of Rac1 showed a strong association. Similar negative results were obtained with the fast cycling RhoGF28L mutant (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S3). Instead, Rac1F28L did show efficient binding to PAK1 under the same experimental conditions (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S3). The different binding properties of Rac1 and RhoG proteins toward PAK1 were not because of different expression levels, since all proteins were detected at similar levels in the transfected cells (Fig. 1D, left panel; Supplemental Materials, Fig. S3, lower panel). Finally, we determined whether these GTPases could activate JNK. To this end, we transfected hemagglutinin-tagged JNK1 in COS1 in the absence or presence of either Rac1Q61L or RhoGQ61L. As positive control, we included a cotransfection of JNK with the vav oncogene product, a well known activator of this kinase (20Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar, 23Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The activity of JNK under these conditions was evaluated 24 h post-transfection using in vitro immunocomplex assays. Rac1Q61L, RhoGQ61L, and the Vav oncoprotein promoted the activation of JNK in these conditions (Fig. 1D, right panel). These results indicate that RhoG and Rac1 induce overlapping, but not identical, signaling pathways and biological responses despite their high structural similarity. RhoG Is Not an Upstream Activator of Rac1—It has been previously described that RhoG appears to activate Rac1 and Cdc42 (10Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, our results showing that RhoGQ61L and RhoGF28L are not transforming argues against such a simplistic interpretation for the RhoG and Rac1 relationship. Indeed, if RhoG were the upstream activator of Rac1, one would expect a transforming activity of this protein identical or higher than that displayed by Rac1Q61L. Because of this discrepancy, we decided to further evaluate the possible upstream situation of RhoG over Rac1. First, we explored the possibility that RhoG could activate Rac1 or Cdc42 in vivo using focus formation assays. As previously described for Ras GEFs (27Bustelo X.R. Suen K.L. Leftheris K. Meyers C.A. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2405-2413PubMed Google Scholar), the co-transfection of an upstream activator with the wild type GTPase should result in higher levels of transforming activity. However, the upstream activator should have no effect over the constitutively active form of the GTPase, because this protein is already locked in the GTP-bound, activated state. Using this experimental approach, we observed that RhoGQ61L could not enhance the transforming activity of wild type Rac1 or Rac1Q61L when co-expressed in rodent fibroblasts (Fig. 2A, both panels). In contrast, the latent transforming activity of Rac1 could be increased by the co-expression of a bona fide upstream activator, the vav oncogene product (Fig. 2A, right panel). RhoGQ61L did enhance the transforming activity of wild type Cdc42, (Fig. 2A, left panel). However, this effect was also observed when wild type Cdc42 was substituted in the experiments by its constitutively active counterpart (Ccd42Q61L) (Fig. 2A, left panel), indicating that this enhanced response is probably a synergistic effect induced by the activation of parallel pathways rather than the direct activation of Cdc42 by RhoGQ61L. In this respect, a similar biological response was found when RhoGQ61L was co-expressed in the same cell system with an unrelated GTPase, the H-Ras oncoprotein (G12V mutant) (Fig. 2A, left panel). These results indicate that the activated version of RhoG does not seem to act as a bona fide activator of Rac1 and/or Cdc42. To further confirm these empirical observations, we investigated whether RhoGQ61L could promote the incorporation of GTP into wild type Rac1 in vivo. To this end, we expressed wild type Rac1 in COS1 cells either alone or in the presence of RhoGQ61L or its switch I mutants (F37L and Y40H). As positive control, we included a well known activator of Rac1, the Vav oncoprotein. After the transfection, the levels of GTP-Rac1 were evaluated by GST pull-down experiments using the GST-PAK1 CRIB fusion protein. These experiments revealed that RhoGQ61L was totally inactive as a Rac1 activator under conditions in which Vav promoted effective GTP loading of this GTPase (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained when RhoGQ61L was replaced by RhoGF28L in these experiments (see Supplementary Materials, Fig. S4). Collectively, these results indicate that there is no linear si"
https://openalex.org/W2116806126,"The prognosis for patients with malignant glioma has not significantly changed in two decades, despite advances in surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, emphasizing the growing need for novel approaches to glioma therapy. Perillyl alcohol (POH) is a naturally occurring monoterpene that has been shown to possess chemotherapeutic as well as chemopreventive activity in animal tumor models and is currently in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. In the present study, we have demonstrated that POH is an effective radiosensitizer at clinically relevant doses of radiation using established glioma cell lines. POH caused a transient arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and induced apoptosis in glioma cells. POH treatment sensitized glioma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis, which was further augmented in the presence of ionizing radiation and abrogated in the presence of antagonistic antibody. POH-induced radiosensitization was partially inhibited in glioma cells expressing dominant negative Fas-associated death domain and completely inhibited in glioma cells overexpressing the cytokine response modifier A. In addition, POH treatment resulted in a dose-dependent sensitization to cisplatin and doxorubicin induced cytotoxicity in glioma cells, highlighting its usefulness as a potent radio/chemosensitizer in the treatment of malignant glioma. The prognosis for patients with malignant glioma has not significantly changed in two decades, despite advances in surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, emphasizing the growing need for novel approaches to glioma therapy. Perillyl alcohol (POH) is a naturally occurring monoterpene that has been shown to possess chemotherapeutic as well as chemopreventive activity in animal tumor models and is currently in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials.

Over the past 2 decades, minimal survival gains for malignant glioma have been recorded, and the disease remains almost universally fatal (1Fine H.A. Dear K.B. Loeffler J.S. Black P.M. Canellos G.P.

To date, radiotherapy has proven to be the most effective treatment for malignant glioma, extending median survival to 8–9 months, and hence the development of an effective radiosensitizer should be particularly relevant in the management of malignant glioma, since 90% of these patients will ultimately develop recurrences immediately within the treatment field (4Mehta M.P.

The malignant cells treated with 100, 300, and 500 μM POH exhibited a 2.6, 8.8, and 18-fold higher rate of apoptosis than the untreated malignant cells. As little as 2000 ppm of POH in the diet inhibited azoxymethane-induced adenoma and adeno-carcinoma development in rat colons (6Kelloff G.J. Boone C.W. Crowell J.A. Steele V.E. Lubet R.A. Doody L.A.

The present paper demonstrates the usefulness of POH as an effective, radio-/chemosensitizer using malignant glioma cell lines (primarily T98G) via activation of the Fas/Fas-ligand (Fas-L) signaling cascade. The Fas receptor (CD95/APO-1) and Fas-ligand (CD95 L) are an interacting receptor ligand pair that elicit apoptosis in many cell types (29Shinohara H. Yagita H. Ikawa Y. Oyaizu N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1766-1772PubMed Google Scholar). Faulty regulation of the Fas system has been described in a variety of human tumors with different histogenetic origin (30Pinkoski M.J.

For as yet unknown reasons, glioma cells co-express Fas and Fas-L in vitro without undergoing suicide or fratricide (34Weller M. Kleihues P. Dichgans J. Ohgaki H. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have demonstrated the apoptotic potential of human glioma cell lines in response to cross-linking of Fas with agonistic anti-Fas antibodies (35Weller M. Frei K. Groscurth P.

Recently, viral vector transduction of the Fas-L gene has been suggested as a potential tool for gene therapy of glioma (42Ambar B.B. Frei K. Malipiero U. Morelli A.E. Castro M.G. Lowenstein P.R.

The ability of POH to modulate the expression of Fas-L on the surface of glioma cells and enhance their susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation is a novel treatment approach that can be extended to other malignancies harboring abnormalities in the Fas signaling cascade (colon, pancreas, and lung) and could form the basis for clinical studies evaluating POH as a radiosensitizer in newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients.

Shitara N. Yamaoka K. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) cell lines were obtained from Dorothy Dougherty (Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco). All of the cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and streptomycin. Cell Treatments and Clonogenic Survival Assays—The clonogenic survival assay was performed to determine the effect of different doses of POH or radiation and a combination of both in a panel of glioma cell lines. A stock solution of POH was made in medium. U251, T98G, MO59K, and C6 cells were treated with varying doses of POH (0.1–1 mm) for 72 h. Control dishes were treated with different doses of radiation, and the plating efficiency was determined by treating cells with medium alone. All cells were irradiated at a dose of ∼7.5 Gy/min using a 137Cs irradiator. The dose of irradiation varied from 1 to 8.5 Gy. Following irradiation, both POH-treated and untreated cells were harvested, washed with PBS, plated at the desired cell number, and incubated for 2 weeks. The colonies were stained with crystal violet and subsequently counted. Survival was determined as the ratio of plating efficiencies for each irradiated group to that of the unirradiated control. The same protocol was used to determine the surviving fraction in T98G cells expressing dominant negative FADD and cytokine response modifier A (Crm A) proteins. For chemosensitization experiments, T98G cells were pretreated with 0.1–0.5 mm POH for 36 h and subsequently treated with increasing doses of cisplatin (1–5.5 μm) or doxorubicin (0.01–0.1 μm) for 36 h. Control cells were treated with the above mentioned doses of POH, cisplatin, doxorubicin, or medium alone. At the end of the incubation, the cells were harvested, and the surviving fraction was determined by clonogenic survival assays as described above. Apoptosis Assays—The percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis and the different phases of the cell cycle were quantified by the method described by Darzynkiewicz et al. (51Darzynkiewicz Z. Traganos F. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 62: 33-73PubMed Google Scholar, 52Gorczyca W. Melamed M.R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 91: 217-238PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were treated with 0.1–1 mm POH for 72 h. The cells were harvested, washed with PBS, fixed in ice-cold 95% ethanol, and stained using a propidium iodide staining solution containing 20 μg/ml PI, 200 μg/ml RNase H, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 solution. The cells were filtered through a 40-micron pore nylon mesh (Tetkop, Inc.) and analyzed using a Beckton-Dickinson FACStar Plus flow cytometer with excitation of 488 nm. The percentage of cells in sub-G0/G1 (apoptotic) peak and the distribution of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were determined using the ModfitLT version 2.0 (Verity Software, Topham, ME) and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). POH-induced cell death was confirmed by a dual staining technique of glioma cells with annexin V and PI, via flow cytometry (53Del Bino G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Degraef C. Mosselmans R. Fokan D. Galand P. Cell Prolif. 1999; 32: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cell lines were treated with POH, harvested by cell dissociation solution, washed, and subsequently stained with antibody to annexin V conjugated to FITC and with PI (10 μg/ml) using the Apoalert kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viable (annexin V-/PI-], preapoptotic (annexin V+/PI-), apoptotic (annexin V+/PI+), and residual damaged cells (annexin V-/PI+) were quantified using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Labeling Cells with BrdUrd—Subconfluent cells of T98G and MO59K cell lines were treated with 0.3–1 mm POH for 48 h. Both POH-treated and untreated cells were pulsed with 10 mm BrdUrd solution 30 min prior to harvesting of cells. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed in ethanol. The cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of pepsin HCl solution (0.4 mg/ml pepsin in 0.1 n HCl), and incubated for 30 min in the dark to digest the plasma membrane. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging at 2000 rpm and resuspended in solution containing 2 n HCl and 0.1 m sodium tetraborate. The nuclear pellet was centrifuged and resuspended in PBS-TB (i.e. PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 90 min at room temperature, after which the pellet was washed again and incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to FITC (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The pellet was washed and resuspended in propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) staining solution overnight. The distribution of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were determined using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Dual Staining of Fas-L and Receptor—Glioma cell lines were treated with 0.1–0.5 mm POH in the presence and absence of 5.5-Gy radiation for 72 h. At the end of the incubation, the cells were harvested using cell dissociation solution. The resulting cell pellet was incubated with biotinylated antibody specific to the human Fas-L or biotinylated IgG1 k isotype control for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with APC-conjugated antibody specific to the human Fas receptor (Pharmingen) and streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin. The cells incubated with biotinylated IgG1 k isotype were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin as well as streptavidin conjugated to APC to determine the nonspecific fluorescence of each treated sample. The cells were washed, and before analysis, propidium iodide was added to the cells at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. This was done to determine the live cells, and the staining in this population was determined. The cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The mean fluorescence intensity of Fas-L was determined on a linear scale, whereas the Fas staining was determined on a log scale using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Assessment of Anti-Fas Antibody-mediated Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis—Glioma cell lines were treated with 1 mm POH in the presence and absence of 5.5 Gy radiation. To determine Fas-mediated cell death, anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (CH11) was added to the cultures at a concentration of 100 ng/ml in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). For inhibition experiments, the antagonistic antibody ZB4 was added at a concentration of 250 ng/ml to the cells. Following a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested and rinsed, and the percentage of viable cells was determined by trypan blue staining. Quantitative analysis of apoptosis was performed by flow cytometric analysis of fixed cells stained with propidium iodide to identify cells with a subdiploid DNA content. Construction of FADD Dominant Negative (FADD-DN) and Crm A-overexpressing Transformants—T98G cells were transfected with the expression vector for FADD-DN (a pEF vector containing an N-terminal 79-amino acid deletion mutant of human FADD (i.e. pEF FLAG FAD-DDN79 puro vector) and Crm A (pEF FLAG-crmA pGK puro vectors) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and the transformants were selected by 1 μg/ml puromycin. Both of the expression vectors were a generous gift from Dr. Andreas Strasser (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3050, Australia) (54Smith K.G. Strasser A. Vaux D.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 55Newton K. Strasser A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The presence of the transfected gene was confirmed by performing Western blots with total cell lysates of the selected clones, and probing with anti-FLAG antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Quantification of Fas-Ligand and Receptor Transcripts by Real Time Quantitative PCR Assay—T98G control cells and two stable transfectants expressing FADD-DN (T98G-FADD-DN6) and overexpressing Crm A (T98GCrmA4) proteins were treated with 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mm POH in the presence and absence of 5.5-Gy radiation. The cells were harvested at 2, 6, 24, and 72 h, respectively. Total RNA was extracted by using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the RNA samples was determined by electrophoresis through agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide, and the 18 and 28 S RNA bands were visualized under UV light. For cDNA synthesis, the reverse transcription polymerase reaction was performed using Ready to Go reverse transcriptase-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) using 1 μg of purified RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers—Primers and probes for the Fas-ligand and Fas receptor genes and 18 S genes were chosen with the assistance of the Primer Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) computer programs. We conducted searches on GenBank™ and EMBL data base sequences to confirm the total gene specificity of the nucleotide sequences chosen for the primers. Primers were purchased from Invitrogen. The sequences of the primers used for the real time quantitative PCR were 5′-CCCTGAGCCACAAGGTCTACA-3′ (up) and 5′-GCCCACATCTGCCCAGTAGT-3′ (down) for Fas-ligand, 5′-TTGGAAGGCCTGCATCATG-3′ (up) and 5′-CAGTCTGGTTCATCCCCATTG-3′ (down) for Fas receptor, and 5′-CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT-3′ (up) and 5′-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCT-3′ (down) for the 18 S gene. Both the primer sets for Fas-L and Fas receptor gave rise to a 100-bp product of Fas-ligand and Fas. Quantitative PCR was performed by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye using the I Cycler detection system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for each reaction, 12.5 μl of the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was mixed with 10.5 μl of water, 10 μm each primer (Fas-L or Fas receptor or 18 S), and 1 μl of each appropriate reverse transcriptase sample. All PCRs were performed in duplicate with a final volume of 25 μl. The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min recommended by the manufacturer. Cycle conditions were 15 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 65 °C. Each sample underwent 50 cycles of amplification to detect the presence of Fas-L, Fas, and 18 S genes. The relative quantification of the Fas-L and Fas expression against an internal standard (18 S) was done by determining the cell cycle number (Ct), revealing the exponential growth of PCR product distinguished from the background. The analysis of each sample was normalized on the basis of its 18 S content, which served as an endogenous control to account for variability in the initial concentration quality of the total RNA and the conversion efficiency of the reverse transcription reaction. N-fold differences in Fas-L and Fas receptor gene expression relative to the 18 S gene were calculated using the formula N(Fas-L or Fas) = 2(ΔCt(Fas-L or Fas)-(ΔCt(18 S)) (56Su S. Vivier R.G.

Perillyl Alcohol Induced Radiosensitization in T98G Cells— Clonogenic survival assays were performed on T98G cells pretreated with varying doses of POH (0.1–1 mm) and radiation (1 to 5.5 Gy). As seen in Fig. 1, pretreatment of T98G with 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mm POH for 72 h did not drastically affect cell survival. Treatment of cells with higher concentrations between 0.7 and 1mm for 72 h resulted in the reduction of the surviving fraction of these cells. Hence, radiosensitization experiments were designed in the dose range between 0.1 and 0.5 mm of POH. T98G (Fig. 1) showed a dose-dependent radiosensitization by POH pretreatment to radiation-induced cell death. Since pretreatment with 0.5 mm POH revealed the greatest radiosensitization, a time course radiosensitization experiment was conducted with 0.5 mm POH and 5.5-Gy radiation. T98G cells were pretreated with 0.5 mm POH for various time intervals between 2 and 24 h. At the end of each time point, the cells were irradiated with 5.5 Gy radiation, immediately replated at an optimum cell number, and incubated for 2 weeks. The colonies were stained with crystal violet, and the surviving fraction was determined as the ratio of plating efficiencies for each irradiated group to that of the unirradiated control. At each time point, there was a parallel set of cells treated with either 0.5 mm POH or 5.5-Gy radiation or medium alone. The results show that the earliest onset of radiosensitization was observed after 8 h of POH treatment (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Time course for POH-"

To assess the role of these “signature” residues in transporter function, the Asp389 and Arg393 residues within the LdNT2 nucleoside transporter from Leishmania donovani were mutated and the resultant phenotypes evaluated after transfection into Δldnt2 parasites. Whereas an R393K mutant retained transporter activity similar to that of wild type LdNT2, the R393L, D389E, and D389N mutations resulted in dramatic losses of transport capability. Tagging the wild type and mutant ldnt2 proteins with green fluorescent protein demonstrated that the D389N and D389E mutants targeted properly to the parasite cell surface and flagellum, whereas the expression of R393L at the cell surface was profoundly compromised. To test whether Asp389 and Arg393 interact, a series of mutants was generated, D389R/R393R, D389D/R393D, and D389R/R393D, within the green fluorescent protein-tagged LdNT2 construct. Although all of these ldnt2 mutants were transport-deficient, D389R/R393D localized properly to the plasma membrane, while neither D389R/R393R nor D389D/R393D could be detected. Moreover, a transport-incompetent D389N/R393N double ldnt2 mutant also localized to the parasite membrane, whereas a D389L/R393L ldnt2 mutant did not, suggesting that an interaction between residues 389 and 393 may be involved in LdNT2 membrane targeting. These studies establish genetically that Asp389 is critical for optimal transporter function and that a positively charged or polar residue at Arg393 is essential for proper expression of LdNT2 at the plasma membrane.

Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, a disease that is invariably fatal if untreated. These protozoan parasites exhibit a digenetic lifecycle, existing as extracellular, flagellated promastigotes within the sandfly vector, and as intracellular amastigotes within the phagolysosome of macrophages and reticuloendothelial cells of the mammalian host. Since there is no immediate prospect of an antileishmanial vaccine, and current drug regimens are complicated by toxicity and curative failure, the need for new drugs to treat leishmaniasis is acute. Rational therapeutic approaches for antiparasitic drug development require the exploitation of fundamental biochemical differences between parasite and host. Perhaps the most striking metabolic discrepancy between parasites and their mammalian hosts is the disparate mechanisms by which they generate purine nucleotides. Whereas mammalian cells synthesize purine nucleotides from amino acids and 1-carbon compounds, all of the protozoan parasites studied to date are incapable of de novo synthesis of the purine ring (1Carter N.S. Rager N. Ullman B. Marr J.J. Nilsen T.W. Komuniecki R.W. Molecular Medical Parasitology. Elsevier Science Ltd., London2003: 197-223Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, purine acquisition from the host is an indispensable nutritional function for which each genus of protozoan parasite has evolved a unique complement of purine salvage enzymes. The initial step in purine salvage involves the translocation of host purines across the parasite surface membranes, a process that is mediated by nucleoside and nucleobase transporters. Nucleoside permeation into L. donovani is mediated by two high affinity transporters with non-overlapping ligand specificity, LdNT1 and LdNT2. LdNT1 transports adenosine and pyrimidine nucleosides, whereas LdNT2 is selective for inosine and guanosine (2Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Sanchez M. Vasudevan G. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc.

Mutants genetically deficient in either LdNT1 or LdNT2 activity have been created by negative selection, and the genes coding for these permeases were subsequently cloned from a cosmid library by functional rescue of nucleoside transport-deficient Leishmania (2Carter N.S.

Based on their primary structures and predicted membrane topologies, LdNT1 and LdNT2 belong to the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) 1The abbreviations used are: ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; TM, transmembrane; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FoB, formycin B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MIT, myo-inositol transporter; IFB, immunofluorescence buffer. family first described in mammals (4Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Numerous putative members of the ENT family have subsequently been characterized (5Carter N.S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 142-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or unveiled within available genome databases (6Acimovic Y. Coe I.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the elucidation of the functional determinants within the ENT family that govern ligand translocation and specificity are still largely unknown. Glycine residues within TM5 of hENT1 and LdNT1 have emerged as important determinants of uridine transport (7SenGupta D.J. Lum P.Y. Lai Y. Shubochkina E. Bakken A.H. Schneider G. Unadkat J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1512-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, by far the majority of analyses focused on the interactions between mammalian ENTs and their specific inhibitors and thus do not easily extrapolate to other members of the ENT family. These studies support a role for transmembrane (TM) domains 3–6 within hENT1 in the binding of the potent inhibitor 4-nitrobenzylthioinosine (8Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Griffiths M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), while Met33 within TM1 of hENT1 has emerged as a determinant of dipyridamole and dilazep sensitivity (9Visser F. Vickers M.F. Ng A.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The elucidation of functional determinants for ENT-mediated transport is hindered by the overall diversity that members of the ENT family exhibit for ligand selectivity and affinity (5Carter N.S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 142-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although ENT members exhibit strikingly low amino acid sequence identities (5Carter N.S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 142-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), multiple sequence alignments of ENT family members from both parasite and mammalian cells reveal a number of conserved or “signature” residues predominantly located in predicted TM spanning regions (5Carter N.S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 142-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Acimovic Y. Coe I.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The most striking of these residues are Asp and Arg, two charged residues that reside in predicted TM8 (see Fig. 1). The preservation of these residues and their topological prediction implies a role in the translocation mechanism. Using the LdNT2 inosine-guanosine transporter as a paradigm for all ENT family members, we describe studies on the role of these two conserved charged residues within LdNT2, Asp389 and Arg393. These investigations demonstrate that Asp389 is critical in the translocation mechanism and imply a structural role for both Asp389 and Arg393. Cell Culture—L. donovani was cultured at 26 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Leishmania (Invitrogen) as described previously (10Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The construction and phenotypic characterization of the null mutant Δldnt2 in which both wild type LdNT2 copies have been eliminated by targeted gene replacement and loss-of-heterozygosity will be described elsewhere. The Δldnt2 strain was cultured continuously in 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science) for which the selective marker, hygromycin phosphotransferase, used in the gene replacement strategy confers resistance. Cell lines generated by transfection of Δldnt2 with plasmids pALTNEO (11Laban A. Tobin J.F. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Wirth D.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and pXG-GFP+2′ (12Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) were selected and maintained in 25 μg/ml G418 (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD), as well as 50 μg/ml hygromycin. Generation and Expression of Site-directed Mutants—Mutations in LdNT2 were generated by the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis protocol, a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations were inserted within the LdNT2 open reading frame that had been ligated into the pALTNEO leishmanial expression plasmid (11Laban A. Tobin J.F. Curotto de Lafaille M.A. Wirth D.F. Nature. 1990; 343: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing and the mutant constructs transfected into the Δldnt2 cell line using standard electroporation conditions (13Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Δldnt2 cells were also transfected with pALTNEO-LdNT2 (wild type LdNT2). The wild type LdNT2 open reading frame was subsequently cloned into the BamHI site of pXG-GFP+2′ (12Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), a leishmanial expression plasmid that tags proteins at the NH2 terminus with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the mutants recreated using the QuikChange® method with the same mutagenic primers as above. All strains transfected with pXG-GFP+2′ constructs were obtained by standard electroporation protocols as for the pALTNEO transfectants. Formycin B Growth Curves—The Δldnt2 parental knock-out and its transfectants were tested for their sensitivity to formycin B (FoB) (Sigma), an inosine isomer that is a potent inhibitor of L. donovani growth (14Robinson N. Kaur K. Emmett K. Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7637-7643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parasites were incubated with various concentrations of FoB and enumerated after ∼6 days on a Coulter counter model ZM. The EC50 value reported is the effective concentration of FoB that inhibits growth by 50%. Transport Assays—Nucleoside transport measurements were performed by a previously described oil-stop method (15Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Time courses were generated at 10 μm [3H]inosine (0.38 Ci/mmol) and 10 μm [3H]guanosine (0.06 Ci/mmol) and kinetic data obtained by measuring rates of inosine transport at concentrations between 0.3 nm and 10 μm. [3H]Inosine (38.4 Ci/mmol) and [3H]guanosine (5.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). Rates of uptake were calculated by linear regression analysis, and kinetic parameters were determined by the method of Hanes (16Hanes C.S. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integral Membrane Protein Preparations—Leishmania at a density of 1 × 107 parasites/ml were pelleted at 2000 × g, resuspended in 1.0 ml of double deionized water in which a Complete™ Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) had been dissolved, and lysed with one round of freezing at –70 °C and thawing at room temperature. The lysates were then sedimented in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at room temperature and the pellets resuspended on ice in 1.0 ml of 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 11.0. After an additional 30 min of sedimentation in the microcentrifuge at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) supplemented with 8 m urea and stored at –20 °C until further use. Cell Surface Labeling—1 × 108 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated on ice with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 2 h. The biotinylation reaction was quenched by washing the cells three times with 50 mm glycine made up in PBS. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol). The cell lysate was pelleted in a microcentrifuge, after which the supernatant was removed to a new microcentrifuge tube and incubated for1hat room temperature with 20 μl of packed streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) prewashed in lysis buffer. After the 1-h incubation the beads were washed two times with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer supplemented with 8 m urea. All samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% slab gel using standard conditions (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and biotinylated GFP-tagged LdNT2 protein detected by immunoblotting with a GFP monoclonal antibody (see below). To quantitate the amount of mutant and wild type GFP-tagged LdNT2 protein labeled at the cell surface, Western blot films were scanned using a model GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) and the intensity of each band corresponding to GFP-tagged transporter assessed by the Molecular Analyst Software version 2.1.2 (Bio-Rad). Background signal was subtracted for each sample and the percentage of cell surface expression calculated for each mutant GFP-tagged transporter relative to wild type GFP-tagged LdNT2. Immunoblotting—Protein samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% slab gel using standard conditions (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). A mouse GFP antibody (living colors A.v. monoclonal JL-8, BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) was used at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% nonfat dry milk. Secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Westgrove, PA) was used at a 1:10,000 dilution in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% nonfat dry milk and signal detected by the CDP-Star chemiluminescence detection system (Roche Applied Science). A rabbit antibody to the L. donovani myo-inositol transporter (MIT) (19Drew M.E. Langford C.K. Klamo E.M. Russell D.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:1,000 dilution in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% nonfat dry milk as a control to normalize protein loading onto each lane of the slab gel. Goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used at 1:10,000 to detect anti-myo-inositol transporter signal. Fluorescence Microscopy—Lab-Tek® II chambered coverglass slides (Fisher) were coated with a 1:10 dilution of poly-l-lysine (Sigma) for 15 min. The chambers were rinsed with double deionized water to remove excess poly-l-lysine, allowed to dry for 1 h at 60 °C, and then cooled to room temperature. 1 × 107 Leishmania promastigotes were resuspended in 1.0 ml PBS, pipetted into the coverslip chamber, and allowed to attach for 15 min. Chambers were rinsed once with PBS and then overlaid with 500 μl PBS. Images were acquired by Aurelie Snyder of the Oregon Health and Science University-Molecular Microbiology & Immunology Research Core Facility at this institution (www.ohsu.edu/core) with the Applied Precision Deltavision® image restoration system. Deconvolution was performed using the iterative constrained algorithm of Sedat and Agard (20Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and additional image processing performed on an SGI Octane work station. Immunofluorescence Microscopy (Live Cells)—1 × 107 Leishmania promastigotes were washed twice with 1.0 ml of PBS and resuspended in 30 μl of immunofluorescence buffer (IFB) consisting of PBS, 1% glucose, 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing with either 50 μl of IFB containing mouse anti-GFP (living colors A.v. monoclonal JL-8, BD Biosciences) diluted 1:100 or 50 μl of IFB containing rabbit anti-tubulin (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) diluted 1:10. Cells were washed twice with 1.0 ml of ice-cold IFB at 2000 × g and incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing with either 30 μl of goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit conjugated to rhodamine red (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and both diluted to 1:150 in IFB. Finally, cells were washed twice with 1.0 ml of ice-cold IFB at 2000 × g, resuspended in 250 μl of ice-cold IFB, and then overlaid on Lab-Tek® II chambered coverglass slides (Fisher) coated with poly-l-lysine and processed for imaging as described in the previous section. Immunofluorescence Microscopy (Permeabilized Cells)—1 × 107 Leishmania promastigotes were washed twice in 1.0 ml of PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde made up in PBS. Cells in fixative were incubated for 30 min at room temperature after which time they were overlaid on Lab-Tek® II chambered coverglass slides (Fisher) coated with poly-llysine. Attached cells were washed twice with PBS containing 2% goat serum (PBS-gs) (Sigma) and permeabilized with 500 μl of PBS-gs containing 0.1% Triton-X-100 (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature. At this time all subsequent steps were performed in the dark to prevent the bleaching of GFP within the permeabilized cells. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either 250 μl of mouse anti-GFP (living colors A.v. monoclonal JL-8, BD Biosciences) diluted 1:100 in PBS-gs or 250 μl of rabbit anti-tubulin (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) diluted 1:10 in PBS-gs. Attached cells were washed twice with 1.0 ml of PBS-gs and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with either 250 μl of goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Rhodamine Red (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) diluted 1:150 in PBS-gs. After this final incubation the cells were washed twice with 1.0 ml of PBS-gs and then overlaid with 500 μl of PBS for imaging. The images were acquired as described previously above. Creation and Growth Phenotype of ldnt2 Mutants—Multiple sequence alignments have revealed the presence of ∼16 conserved amino acids residues among functionally characterized ENT family members from mammalian and parasitic organisms (5Carter N.S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 142-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two of these, Asp389 and Arg393 in LdNT2, are charged, and according to the hidden Markov topological algorithm (21Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) are located within predicted TM8 (Fig. 1). To assess the functional roles of these two charged residues in ligand permeation, the mutations D389E, D389N, R393K, and R393L were inserted into the LdNT2 gene within the expression construct pALTNEO-LdNT2 and the mutant constructs transfected into Δldnt2 L. donovani to create Δldnt2[D389E], Δldnt2[D389N], Δldnt2[R393K], and Δldnt2[R393L], respectively. A wild type LdNT2 transfectant, Δldnt2[LdNT2], was also created as a control. The Δldnt2 cell line was obtained by deleting both copies of the LdNT2 gene from wild type L. donovani and is, consequently, deficient in inosineguanosine transport. Each of these transfectant lines was initially evaluated for sensitivity to FoB, a cytotoxic inosine analog to which the nucleoside transport-deficient parental Δldnt2 strain is highly resistant (Table I). The transfectants harboring wild type or mutated copies of LdNT2 varied greatly in their growth susceptibility to the drug. Whereas, the EC50 value of FoB that inhibited Δldnt2 cell growth was ∼8.3 μm, transfection and amplification of an episomal copy of wild type LdNT2 within Δldnt2 (Δldnt2[LdNT2]) increased the sensitivity of the null mutant to FoB by 3 orders of magnitude (EC50 value = 7.3 nm). This nanomolar level of sensitivity to FoB is comparable with that previously reported for wild type L. donovani (2Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Sanchez M. Vasudevan G. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Three of the four mutant transfectant lines, Δldnt2[D389E], Δldnt2[R393K], and Δldnt2[R393L], also exhibited varying degrees of sensitivity to FoB compared with the parental recipient knockout strain but not to the extent of the Δldnt2[LdNT2] wild type transfectant. The only exception, Δldnt2[D389N], exhibited an EC50 value of 5.7 μm, a value close to that of the parental Δldnt2 line (Table I).Table ISensitivity to formycin BCell lineEC50μ mΔldnt28.3 ± 0.9Δldnt2[LdNT2]0.0073 ± 0.0017Δldnt2[R393K]0.19 ± 0.04Δldnt2[R393L]0.6 ± 0.1Δldnt2[D389E]0.71 ± 0.15Δldnt2[D389N]5.7 ± 1.4Δldnt2[D389R]5.7 ± 0.9Δldnt2[R393D]7.3 ± 0.9Δldnt2[D389R/R393D]6.3 ± 1.3Δldnt2[GFP-LdNT2]0.0079 ± 0.0008Δldnt2[GFP-D389N/R393N]6.0Δldnt2[GFP-D389L/R393L]7.5 Open table in a new tab Transport Capabilities of the ldnt2 Mutants—The altered sensitivities of transfectant lines harboring Asp389 and Arg393 mutations toward FoB implied that LdNT2 transport capacity was impaired. To determine the effects of these mutations on transport directly, each of the transfectants was evaluated for [3H]inosine and [3H]guanosine uptake at a saturating ligand concentration for LdNT2 (10 μm) (2Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Sanchez M. Vasudevan G. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The ability of the transfectant cell lines to take up both 6-oxypurine nucleosides was directly proportional to the sensitivity of the strain to FoB (Fig. 2, A and B). Whereas Δldnt2[R393K] cells incorporated both inosine and guanosine at a rate comparable with the wild type Δldnt2[LdNT2] transfectant, the capacities of the Δldnt2[D389E] and Δldnt2[R393L] lines to take up both ligands was less than 10% of the wild type transfectant (Fig. 2). The D389N mutation was even more incapacitating, since the Δldnt2[D389N] line, like the Δldnt2 knock-out, exhibited no measurable [3H]inosine or [3H]guanosine uptake capability under these parameters. Because these radiolabel incorporation assays were carried out over a 4 min interval, uptake measurements were also performed over shorter intervals to assess impaired transport capabilities more accurately and to minimize metabolic contributions to the uptake measurements. The results of rapid transport assays (see “Experimental Procedures”), where the uptake of 10 μm [3H]inosine or [3H]guanosine was measured over intervals up to 10 s, correlated well with the results of the longer 4 min uptake assays (Fig. 2, C and D). To determine whether these transport-incapacitating mutations affected the affinity of the LdNT2 protein for ligand, transport assays were performed at varying [3H]inosine concentrations over time intervals where uptake was linear. Km values of 0.4 ± 0.19 μm, 2.5 ± 1.2 μm, 1.8 ± 1.1 μm, and 2.0 ± 1.6 μm were calculated by Hanes analysis for Δldnt2[LdNT2], Δldnt2[R393K], Δldnt2[R393L] and Δldnt2[D389E], respectively (data not shown). The lack of transport by Δldnt2[D389N] cells obviously precluded an accurate Km determination Cell Surface Targeting of GFP-LdNT2 and GFP-ldnt2— Since the ligand affinities of the mutant transporters were apparently not altered in comparison with the wild type transporter, to determine whether the impaired transport capacity of the ldnt2 transfectants affected proper targeting or expression of the transporter both wild type and all of the mutant transporters were tagged with GFP at the NH2 terminus and the corresponding genes transfected into the Δldnt2 background. The wild type transfectant, Δldnt2[GFP-LdNT2], exhibited an EC50 value of 7.9 + 0.8 nm for FoB, a value virtually identical to that observed for Δldnt2[LdNT2] (Table I). Moreover, Δldnt2[GFP-LdNT2] parasites also displayed robust [3H]inosine uptake with a Km value of 1.3 + 0.6 μm (n = 3) (Fig. 3 and Table II), an inosine affinity slightly less than that observed with the Δldnt2[LdNT2] transfectant described above. Localization studies using direct GFP fluorescence and deconvolution microscopy demonstrated that GFP-LdNT2 was robustly synthesized and targeted to both the plasma membrane and flagellum (Fig. 4A). A diffuse and relatively weak cytosolic GFP fluorescence was observed with Δldnt2 parasites transfected with the empty pXG-GFP+2′ vector alone (Fig. 4B).Table IIKinetic parameters of GFP-LdNT2 and Asp389 and Arg393 GFP-ldnt2 mutants.Cell lineVmaxExpressionAdjusted VmaxKmpmol/min/108 cells%mmΔldnt2[GFP-LdNT2]14 ± 5.3100141.3 ± 0.6Δldnt2[GFP-R393K]3 ± 0.867 ± 2551.7 ± 0.3Δldnt2[GFP-R393L]0.8 ± 0.37.1 ± 0.7111.6 ± 0.4Δldnt2[GFP-D389E]0.8 ± 0.4120 ± 370.71.1 ± 0.5Δldnt2[GFP-D389N]ND140 ± 20NDND Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Deconvolution microscopy of Δldnt2 transfectants.

The Δldnt2[GFP-R393K], Δldnt2[GFP-R393L], and Δldnt2[GFP-D389E] lines transported [3H]inosine at 21, 6, and 6% of the rate of Δldnt2[GFP-LdNT2] parasites, respectively (values based upon the observed V max reported in Table II), whereas the Δldnt2[GFP-D389N] transfectant showed no [3H]inosine uptake capability (Table II). Km values for [3H]inosine transport were equivalent among all the transport-competent transfectants (Fig. 3 and Table II). All of the mutant ldnt2 transporters localized to the parasite plasma membrane, except GFP-R393L, which predominantly localized to the flagellar membrane (Fig. 4, C–F). Additionally, a rod-like formation was observed in the Δldnt2[GFP-R393L] mutant (Fig. 4D). A similar structure, a novel multivesicular tubular compartment, was previously described in Leishmania parasites where the cell surface trafficking of membrane proteins was impaired (22Mullin K.A.

Here we show that Escherichia coli bacteria expressing fibrous surface proteins, known as curli, assemble and activate factors of the human coagulation cascade at their surface. As a result of this interaction, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin and fibrinogen-derived peptides, termed fibrinopeptides, are generated. The molecular mechanisms behind the bacteria-induced formation of fibrinopeptides were investigated and shown to be triggered by the activation of the contact system, also known as the kallikrein/kinin system or the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Samples containing fibrinopeptides generated by the interaction between bacteria and plasma were injected into animals and the inflammatory response was monitored. We found that this treatment provoked an infiltration of white blood cells, and the induction of the proinflammatory cytokine MCP-1 at the inflamed site. Our results therefore demonstrate that activation of the coagulation system at the bacterial surface contributes to the pathophysiology of bacterial infectious diseases.

Our results therefore demonstrate that activation of the coagulation system at the bacterial surface contributes to the pathophysiology of bacterial infectious diseases. Bacterial binding to eukaryotic cells, extracellular matrix proteins, or soluble components such as plasma proteins, is an important mechanism that allows the invading microorganism to establish, proliferate, and modulate the host response. In order to facilitate host specificity and tissue tropism, Gram-negative bacteria produce a number of different surface organelles, which can be classified into non-fimbrial and fimbrial adhesins (for a review see Ref. 1Klemm P. Schembri M.A. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Most Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains carry a set of genes coding for a fimbrial organelle that is termed “curli” in E. coli (2Olsén A. Jonsson A. Normark S. Nature. 1989; 338: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and “thin, aggregative fimbriae” in Salmonella (3Collinson S.K. Emödy L. Müller K.H. Trust T.J. Kay W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4773-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For simplification, these structures are collectively referred to as curli in this study. Electron microscopy has revealed that curli form thin, wiry, and highly aggregative coiled surface structures that are morphologically distinct from other types of fimbriae (2Olsén A. Jonsson A. Normark S. Nature. 1989; 338: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 4Stathopoulos C. Hendrixson D.R. Thanassi D.G. Hultgren S.J. St Geme 3rd, J.W. Curtiss 3rd., R. Microbes. Infect. 2000; 2: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The finding that this organelle is preferentially expressed by enterohemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic, and sepsis strains, but not by enteroinvasive and enteropathogenic bacteria, implicates curli as an important virulence factor (5Olsén A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Ben Nasr A.B. Olsén A. Sjöbring U. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Curli have a broad range of binding specificity. Like other fimbriae, curli fibers are involved in bacterial attachment to, and invasion of eukaryotic cells, which is promoted by the interaction between curli and fibronectin (7Dibb-Fuller M.P. Allen-Vercoe E. Thorns C.J. Woodward M.J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Gophna U. Oelschlaeger T.A. Hacker J. Ron E.Z. FEMS Microbiol.

Other ligands for curli are laminin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator, MHC class I antigen, and fibrinogen, as well as most coagulation factors (5Olsén A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Sjöbring U. Pohl G. Olsén A. Mol.

Mörgelin M. Lindbom L. Alm P. Björck L. Herwald H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In E. coli, formation of curli organelles is regulated by two operons, csgDEFG and csgBA, which code for six proteins, termed CsgA to CsgG (for a review see Ref. 4Stathopoulos C. Hendrixson D.R. Thanassi D.G. Hultgren S.J. St Geme 3rd, J.W. Curtiss 3rd., R. Microbes. Infect. 2000; 2: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that CsgA carries two binding-sites for the different ligands, located at the N- and C-terminal part of the molecule (13Olsén A. Herwald H. Wikström M. Persson K. Mattsson E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34568-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In solution, purified CsgA assembles into amyloids that are indistinguishable from curli fibers, indicating that CsgA is the major subunit in curli (14Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the organelle has demonstrated that CsgB acts as a nucleator and CsgG as an outer membrane-located lipoprotein, whereas CsgD is a transcription regulator that belongs to the LuxR/UhpA family. The functions of CsgE and CsgF are still unknown (4Stathopoulos C. Hendrixson D.R. Thanassi D.G. Hultgren S.J. St Geme 3rd, J.W. Curtiss 3rd., R. Microbes. Infect. 2000; 2: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The role of curli-expressing bacteria in infectious diseases has been demonstrated in different in vitro and in vivo studies. When injected into animals, curli-expressing bacteria disrupt the coagulation cascade by modulating the contact system and trigger inflammatory reactions by activating inducible nitricoxide synthase (12Persson K. Mörgelin M. Lindbom L. Alm P. Björck L. Herwald H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Olsén A. Rhen M. Dahlbäck B.

Dis. 2001; 183: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been observed that E. coli bacteria expressing curli and a mutant strain secreting soluble CsgA stimulate a human macrophage cell line to produce proinflammatory cytokines (17Bian Z. Brauner A. Li Y. Normark S. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the same study it was also shown that serum samples from convalescent patients with sepsis, but not sera from healthy controls contain antibodies against CsgA, indicating that curli are expressed during the course of disease (17Bian Z. Brauner A. Li Y. Normark S. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen plays an important role in blood clotting, fibrinolysis, cellular and matrix interactions, and wound healing (18Mosesson M.W. Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 11-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In addition to these functions fibrinogen also acts as a powerful initiator of inflammation, which is in part caused by its interaction with integrins expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and several subsets of lymphocytes (19Ugarova T.P. Yakubenko V.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 368-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Amplification of the inflammatory response may also result from the formation of fibrin by thrombin and/or its subsequent degradation by plasmin. This leads to the generation of proinflammatory fibrinopeptides and fibrin degradation products, respectively. While fibrinopeptides, in particular fibrinopeptide B, are potent neutrophil chemoattractants (20Senior R.M. Skogen W.F. Griffin G.L. Wilner G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Skogen W.F. Senior R.M. Griffin G.L. Wilner G.D. Blood. 1988; 71: 1475-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Singh T.M.

Montes R. Panizo C. Haematologica. 1998; 83: 1024-1037PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to investigate whether curli-expressing bacteria can induce the formation of a fibrin network around the bacterium, leading to the release of fibrinopeptides. In addition, experiments were performed to determine if inhibition of the contact system in vitro and in vivo could revert some of the complications caused by bacterial-induced activation of this system. Bacterial Strains and Culture Media—The E. coli K12 strain YMel was used in this study (24Richenberg H.V. Lester G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1955; 13: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A mutant strain YMel-1 was generated by insertional mutagenesis of the CsgA gene in YMel (5Olsén A. Arnqvist A. Hammar M. Sukupolvi S. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown on colonization factor antigen agar (25Evans D.G. Evans D.J.J. Tjoa W. Infect. Immun. 1977; 18: 330-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 28 °C for 48 h, washed, and resuspended in buffer A (0.03 m NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2), buffer B (buffer A + 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), buffer C (15 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl2, pH 7.4), or buffer D (13 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4). Sources of Proteins and Reagents—Fibrinogen, fibrinopeptide A and B (FPA and FPB), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EM, electron microscopy; WBC, white blood cell; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; aPTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; TCT, thrombin clotting time. E. coli, O55:B5) were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. Fibrin was from Biopool, Umeå, Sweden and the H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK peptide was from Bachem Feinchemikalien AG, Switzerland. Peptides based on the sequence of the CsgA curli subunit, were synthesized at Innovagen, Lund, Sweden and characterized as described earlier (13Olsén A. Herwald H. Wikström M. Persson K. Mattsson E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34568-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The peptides were GVV24 (GVVPQYGGGGNHGGGGGNNSGPNSE), NNS24 (NNSGPNSELNIYQYGGGNSALALQ), ALQ26 (ALQTDARNSDLTITQHGGGNGADVGQ), ADV20 (ADVGQGSDDSSIDLTQRGFG), GFG24 (GFGNSATLDQWNGKNSEMTVKQFG), KQF22 (KQFGGGNGAAVDQTASNSSVNV), and VDQ26 (VDQTASNSSVNVTQVGFGNNATAHQY). Proteins were iodinated by the chloramine-T method of Fraker and Speck (26Fraker P.J. Speck S.C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Plasma—Blood samples were drawn from healthy volunteers into Vacutainer tubes (BD Vacutainer, Plymouth, UK) containing 1:9 vol, 129 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4. Samples were pooled and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 20 min. The pellet was removed and plasma was stored at –80 °C. Fresh frozen plasma samples from healthy individuals were obtained from the blood bank at Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden and kept frozen at –80 °C until use. Binding and Competition Assays—Bacteria resuspended in buffer B, were adjusted to concentrations of 2 × 109,1 × 109,2 × 108, and 2 × 107 cells/ml. Binding assays were performed as previously described (15Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Olsén A. Rhen M. Dahlbäck B. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of bacterial suspensions were incubated with 25 μl(∼8 × 105 cpm/ml) radioactively labeled protein for 1 h at room temperature. For the competition assays the radiolabeled protein (25 μl; ∼8 × 105 cpm/ml) was mixed with various concentrations of the unlabelled competitor (fibrinogen or fibrin) before the addition of 200 μl of bacteria (2 × 108 cfu/ml). Samples were washed with 1 ml of buffer B, followed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were removed, and the remaining radioactivity in the pellet was counted. Binding was expressed as the percentage of bound versus total radioactivity. Scatchard Analysis—The affinity constants of 125I-labeled fibrinogen or fibrin and YMel bacteria using the Scatchard formula were performed as previously reported (27Åkerström B. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19740-19746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Slot Binding Experiments—Peptides spanning the CsgA curli subunit were dissolved in buffer A and applied to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Milliblot-D system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with buffer B, containing 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Membranes were incubated with 10 ml 125I-labeled fibrinogen or fibrin (∼2 × 105 cpm/ml) for3hat room temperature, washed in buffer B, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film using an intensifying screen (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Negative Staining EM of Peptides—The structure of complexes between fibrinogen and curli-derived peptides was analyzed by negative staining and electron microscopy as described previously (28Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The peptides were identified by labeling with colloidal thiocyanate gold (29Baschong W. Lucocq J.M. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1985; 83: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Sample concentrations were usually in the range of 10–20 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS). Fibrinogen and gold-labeled curli peptides were mixed in TBS buffer and allowed to react for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, 5-μl aliquots were adsorbed onto carbon-coated grids for 1 min, washed with two drops of water, and stained on two drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. Clotting Assays—The fibrinogen polymerization time was measured in a coagulometer (Amelung, Lemgo, Germany). 30 μl of bacterial suspensions (2 × 1010 bacteria/ml, resuspended in buffer D) were incubated with 200 μl plasma or fibrinogen solutions (3 mg/ml) for 2 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 100 μl thrombin clotting time (TCT) reagent (Accuclot, Sigma Diagnostic). For inhibition studies, 30 μl of solution containing increasing amounts of H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK (3–75 μg/ml final concentration) were incubated with 100 μl of plasma for 1 min to measure activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or with 200 μl of plasma for 2 min for TCT at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of Platelin LS (aPTT kit; Diagnostica Stago, Asnières, France) for 200 s at 37 °C followed by the addition of 100 μl of a 25 mm CaCl2 solution (aPTT) or 100 μl of TCT reagent, respectively. Chromogenic Substrate Assay—YMel bacteria were washed and adjusted to 2 × 1010 bacteria/ml in buffer C. Equal volumes (0.5 ml) of bacteria and plasma were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK (final concentration). The samples were then washed three times in buffer C and resuspended in 0.25 ml of 1 mm chromogenic substrate S-2302 (H-d-prolyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride, substrate for FXII and PK), S-2222 (N-benzoyl-l-isoleucyl-l-glutamyl-gly-cyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline hydrochloride and its methyl ester, substrate for FX), S-2238 (H-d-Phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride, substrate for thrombin), or 0.3 mm chromogenic substrate S-2366 (l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline hydrochloride, substrate for FXI). All substrates were purchased from Haemochrom Diagnostica AB, Göteborg, Sweden. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the bacteria were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 2 min, and the absorbance of the supernatants at 405 nm was measured. Thin Sectioning and Transmission Electron Microscopy—YMel and YMel-1 bacteria were washed and adjusted to 2 × 1010 bacteria/ml in buffer D. Equal volumes (0.1 ml) of bacteria and plasma were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK (final concentration). The samples were then washed three times in buffer D and after the final centrifugation step the bacteria were resuspended in buffer D. Samples were fixed for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4 (cacodylate buffer). Afterward, they were washed with cacodylate buffer and postfixed for 1 h at room temperature in 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and then embedded in Epon 812 using acetone as an intermediate solvent. Specimens were sectioned with a diamond knife into 50-nm thick ultrathin sections on an LKB ultramicrotome. The ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at 80 kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. Bacterially Triggered Generation of Fibrinopeptides—YMel and YMel-1 bacteria were washed and adjusted to 2 × 1010 bacteria/ml in buffer C. Equal volumes (0.5 ml) of bacteria and citrate-treated plasma were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C on a rotator in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK (final concentration). The bacteria were then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatants were measured using the Zymutest FPA kit (Hyphen BioMed, Andrésy, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Determination of Bradykinin—YMel and YMel-1 bacteria were washed and adjusted to 2 × 1010 cells/ml in buffer C. Bacteria were then treated as described above (see “Bacterially triggered generation of fibrinopeptides”). After removal of the bacteria by centrifugation (3000 × g), plasma supernatants were ultrafiltrated through a Microcon device (cut off 3000 Dalton; Millipore, Bedford, MA) and the bradykinin concentrations in the filtrates were determined by the Markit-A kit (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) as described (30Herwald H. Collin M. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Animal Experiments—8-week-old female Balb/c mice (Taconic M&B A/S, Ry, Denmark) were used in the experiments. Animals were housed in a controlled environment at an ambient temperature of 20 °C on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum. The regional ethical committee for animal experimentation approved the animal experiments (permit number M251–01). A subcutaneous air pouch was formed as previously described (31Edwards J.C. Sedgwick A.D. Willoughby D.A. J. Pathol. 1981; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) when animals were under anesthesia (Forene®, Abbott Scandinavia AB, Solna, Sweden). Briefly, 100 μl of test substances were injected together with 0.9 ml of air into the dorsal region of the mouse. Low molecular weight filtrates were obtained by incubating plasma with bacteria in the absence (LMWF-Inh) or presence (LMWF+Inh) of 50 μg/ml H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK (final concentration) as described above (see “Bacterially triggered generation of fibrinopeptides”). Control substances were bradykinin (2,4 ng/ml), H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK (50 μg/ml), a mixture of FPA and FPB (0.5 μg/ml of each peptide), LPS (0.5 μg/ml), and vehicle alone (buffer A). After 72 h, the mice were sacrificed and the inflammatory exudates in the air pouches were recovered by lavaging the pouch with 1 ml of sterile buffer A. The lavage fluid was quickly aspirated and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were removed and frozen immediately for later determination of the MCP-1 concentration by the OptEIA™ Mouse MCP-1 Set (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. The pelleted cells were resuspended in sterile buffer A and counted. Curli-expressing E. coli Bacteria Bind Fibrinogen and Monomeric Fibrin—The conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is a critical step in infectious diseases that may lead to severe complications such as the formation of microclots, which can deposit in various organs. In order to study the influence of pathogenic bacteria on fibrin network formation, the binding of a curli-expressing E. coli strain (YMel) to fibrinogen and monomeric fibrin was investigated. The isogenic mutant strain YMel-1 that lacks curli was used as a control. Fig. 1A shows that 125I-fibrinogen and 125I-fibrin bound to YMel bacteria equally well. The binding was blocked in the presence of a molar excess of unlabelled fibrinogen or fibrin, respectively (Fig. 1B). By contrast, no binding to YMel-1 was observed. To further characterize this interaction at the molecular level, we sought to map fibrinogen/fibrin binding sites in curli. Thus, seven over-lapping synthetic peptides covering the entire CsgA curli subunit (13Olsén A. Herwald H. Wikström M. Persson K. Mattsson E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34568-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were applied to membranes and probed with radiolabeled fibrinogen or fibrin. As previously reported (13Olsén A. Herwald H. Wikström M. Persson K. Mattsson E. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34568-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), fibrinogen bound to peptides NNS24 and VDQ26 (Fig. 2B), which are located at the N- and C-terminal region of the CsgA molecule, respectively (Fig. 2A). Fibrin was also found to interact with peptides NNS24 and VDQ26 (Fig. 2C). All other peptides showed little or no affinity for fibrinogen or fibrin. Of note, the binding of 125I-fibrinogen to peptides NNS24 and VDQ26 was inhibited by the addition of unlabeled fibrinogen. The determined half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) are 2.93 ± 1.63 nmol for the interaction with NNS24 and 2.49 ± 1.38 nmol for the interaction with VDQ26.Fig. 2Binding of radiolabeled fibrinogen or fibrin to synthetic peptides covering the CsgA curli subunit. A, a schematic drawing showing the positions of the synthetic peptides in CsgA. Each peptide is named by its first three amino acids followed by the total number of amino acids in the peptide. Various amounts (0.5–5 μg) of each peptide was applied to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with ∼5 × 105 cpm of 125I-labeled fibrinogen (B) or 125I-labeled fibrin (C) (corresponding to ∼20–50 ng of protein). After 3 h of incubation the membrane was washed extensively and exposed to autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To visualize the interaction between fibrinogen and curli-derived peptides negative staining and electron microscopy was employed. Fig. 3 shows that peptides NNS24 and VDQ26, labeled with colloidal gold, bound avidly to fibrinogen. A statistical evaluation (some 300 molecules in each case) of the binding properties of the different peptides revealed that ∼22% of the added gold-labeled NNS24 peptide and 39% of the gold-labeled VDQ26 peptide were associated with fibrinogen. In contrast, only 7% of the control peptide KFQ22 bound fibrinogen. It appeared that NNS24 interacts preferentially with the central globular D-domains of fibrinogen (77% of the bound gold-labeled NNS24 was associated with the D domain), while VDQ26 has more affinity for terminal globular E-domains (79% of the bound gold-labeled peptide was associated with the E domain). In contrast, control peptide KQF22 had only limited affinity for the globular, but not the extended domains of fibrinogen (43 and 57% of the total bound gold-labeled peptide was associated with the D and E domains, respectively). Taken together the presented data demonstrate that curli fibers have a high affinity to fibrinogen and fibrin, which is mediated by two regions in the CsgA molecule and the D and E globular domains of fibrinogen. Curliated Bacteria Interfere with Fibrin Polymerization— Based on the results obtained from the binding studies, we wondered whether the interaction between fibrinogen and curliated bacteria could influence the ability of normal human plasma to clot. Thus, the effect of these bacteria on fibrin network formation was studied by measuring the fibrin polymerization time (TCT). Fig. 4A shows that addition of YMel bacteria to plasma provoked a prolongation of the clotting time in the TCT assay, whereas incubation with YMel-1 resulted in values that were in the same range as the plasma control. The effect of YMel bacteria on the TCT was dose-dependent (data not shown). As these results implicate that the interaction between curli and fibrinogen is at least partially responsible for this effect, purified fibrinogen (3 mg/ml; the physiological concentration in plasma) was incubated with bacteria and then subjected to the TCT assay. As seen in experiments using normal plasma, the incubation of YMel bacteria with purified fibrinogen impaired the clotting times, whereas YMel-1 had no effect. Thus, the data demonstrate that the interaction between curli fibers and fibrinogen contributes to the observed clotting abnormalities. Curli-induced Clotting Disturbances Are Prevented by Contact System Inhibition—Previous studies have shown that the assembly and activation of the contact system at the surface of curli-expressing bacteria triggers not only the release of bradykinin from the bacterium, it also influences normal clotting (12Persson K. Mörgelin M. Lindbom L. Alm P. Björck L. Herwald H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Olsén A. Rhen M. Dahlbäck B. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, experiments were performed to address the question of how contact activation triggers the coagulation system on bacteria. To identify the role of bacteria-induced contact activation, an inhibitor of FXII and PK (H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK) (32Ghebrehiwet B. Randazzo B.P. Dunn J.T. Silverberg M. Kaplan A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1450-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was used. Fig. 5A shows that when increasing concentrations of H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK were added to human plasma in the absence of bacteria, there was approximately a 19-fold prolongation of the aPTT. The finding that H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK had only a marginal effect on the TCT (∼1.5-fold), suggests the inhibitor is specific for the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. To confirm these results, the effect of H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK on the amidolytic activity of purified activated thrombin, FX, and kallikrein was analyzed using chromogenic substrate assays. The determined half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) are 4.9 × 10–6m, 1.35 × 10–6m, and 1.77 × 10–8m for thrombin, FX, and kallikrein, respectively, demonstrating that the inhibitor preferentially blocks the activity of PK. We next investigated whether contact activation at the bacterial surface leads to an activation of other coagulation factors involved in the initiation of clot formation. Incubation of YMel bacteria with plasma led to an increased FXII/PK activity at the bacterial surface, as indicated by the hydrolysis of a FXII/PK-specific substrate (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained when the enzymatic activities of FXI, FX, and thrombin were investigated (Fig. 5B). However, in the presence of H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-CMK the activities of all factors tested were comparable to control levels. Taken together, the data implicate that activation of coagulation f"

Although much is known about these receptors, the mechanism of nucleotide transport out of the cytoplasm is unknown. We developed a functional screen for ATP release to the extracellular space and identified Mcd4p, a 919-amino acid membrane protein with 14 putative transmembrane domains, as a participant in glucose-dependent ATP release from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This release occurred through the vesicular trafficking pathway initiated by ATP uptake into the Golgi compartment. Both the compartmental uptake and the extracellular release of ATP were regulated by the activity of the vacuolar H+-ATPase. It is likely that the Mcd4p pathway is generally involved in non-mitochondrial ATP movement across membranes, it is essential for Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum function, and its occurrence led to the appearance of P2 purinergic receptors.

Expression of CD39 in Xenopus oocytes is associated with an ATP-associated current, suggesting the involvement of CD39 in ATP movement (30Bodas E. Aleu J. Pujol G. Martin-Satue M. Marsal J.

Thus far, the protein components involved in nucleotide export have not been identified conclusively and the molecular mechanisms for the process remain obscure.To directly tackle this question, we have developed a novel functional screen that provides an effective system to identify genes involved in ATP transport. A highly conserved Mcd4p protein family, present in yeast and man, was found to mediate ATP release from cells. Interestingly, Mcd4p-mediated ATP release occurred through the membrane-trafficking pathway initiated by ATP uptake into the Golgi. Both the ATP uptake and the extracellular release were dependent on the activity of the vacuolar H+-ATPase. We suggest that this pathway is the mechanism for ATP release in eukaryotic cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Media, and Chemicals—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used were RH407-6b (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 ura3 trp1 bar1) (31Maser P.

Plasmid DNA (ATP1–3) from colonies surrounded with tiny pink colonies was isolated, sequenced, and analyzed on the yeast genomic data base. ATP1–3 contained a roughly 15-kb DNA insert including the MCD4, PIR1, and PIR3 genes.Measurement of ATP Release—Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C overnight on complete minimum uracil drop-out medium containing 2% glucose (A 650 ≈ 2.5) and then transferred to fresh medium at a cell density of roughly 6 × 107 cells ml–1 (A 650 = 1 corresponded to 1.6 × 107 cells ml–1). The cells were kept at 30 °C on a rotatory shaker. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were taken at each time point, as indicated in Figs. 3B, 4, B and C, and 5B, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. To determine the ATP content of the supernatants, an aliquot of 100 μl of the sample was mixed with 100 μl of a luciferase/luciferin reagent (ENLITEN™ ATP assay system, Promega, Madison, WI) and the light emission was read with a luminometer (model TD-20/20, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). An ATP standard curve was obtained under the same conditions with the provided ATP standards. Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity of the cell suspensions was determined according to Crotti et al. (37Crotti L.B. Drgon T. Cabib E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with the Sigma Diagnostics isocitrate dehydrogenase kit (Sigma) by measuring the rate at which NADP was converted to NADPH+. To cells suspended in 1 ml of isocitrate buffer at a density of 108 cells/ml, 1 ml of NADP solution containing 0.6 mg of NADP was added. At intervals, a 0.25-ml aliquot of the suspension was centrifuged at 5000 × g to pellet the cells and the A 340 of the supernatant solution was measured with a Beckman DU-50 spectrophotometer. The integrity of the cells was determined by incubation of the cells with 0.01% methylene blue (w/v). Total cells and blue cells were counted.Fig. 4Overexpression of three other members of the Mcd4p protein family also stimulates ATP efflux.

The relationships were derived from neighbor-joining weighted progressive alignments of the protein sequences using the ClustalW program (68Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of the alignment was performed with the software PAUP, version 4.0b1 for Macintosh (Ref. 69Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, Version 4.0b1.

Overnight cultures of CTY182 (wild type), CTY182-A (ynd1Δ), G2–6 (wild type), and G2–7(gda1Δ) in YPD at 30 °C were measured for their extracellular ATP (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was done as described by Berninsone et al. (38Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Cells were grown to A 600 = 4 in medium at 30 °C, isolated by centrifugation, and converted to spheroplasts. Spheroplasts were lysed by dilution in hypo-osmotic buffer, and the lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove large particles. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g (P13) and 120,000 × g (P120) for 20 and 60 min, respectively. The P13 and P120 pellets were suspended in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 0.8 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA.Plasmids and Antibodies—To overexpress MCD4, GPI7, and GPI13 genes in yeast, PCR fragments generated from chromosomal DNA of YPH500 with the following primers were cloned into pVT101U (39Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Primer 176 (5′-AACTGCAGGTAACCATGTGGAACAAAACCAGAACGACG-3′ containing a PstI site and a sense sequence of the MCD4 open reading frame (nucleotides 1–24)) and primer 17 (5′-CGCGGATCCCTACAAGTCCTCTTCAGATATCAGCTTTTGCTCTTGTGTTTTTTTGGTTTTATCCTG-3′ containing a BamH1 site, an antisense sequence of a myc tag and the MCD4 open reading frame (nucleotides 2734–2757)) were used for the MCD4 gene (resulting plasmid pGZ170).

To overexpress a His-tagged N-terminal soluble domain of Mcd4p (sMcd4p) for antisera generation, a PCR fragment generated with primer 194 (5′-CGCGGATCCGACCACTTTTGATAAAGTCACT-3′ containing a BamHI site and a sense sequence of the MCD4 open reading frame (nucleotides 187–207)), primer 195 (5′-AACTGCAGTCAAGTTCTAATGAATCTCCAATTATA-3′ containing a PstI site and an antisense sequence of the MCD4 open reading frame (nucleotides 1348–1371)), and the template pGZ170 was cloned into pTrcHisB (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pGZ177 was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, and overproduction and purification of the His6-sMcd4p protein were performed as described previously (40Zhong X. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1347-1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antisera for Mcd4p were raised against purified His6-sMcd4p proteins (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA). To make the vector to express the human MCD4 gene (hMCD4), a PCR fragment was generated with primer 189 (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGCTGCTGTTCTTTACTTTGGGA-3′ containing a HindIII site and a sense sequence of the hMCD4 open reading frame (nucleotides1–24)), primer 190 (5′-CGGAATTCCATGAAGTGACTTTTGGGTTTGCC-3′ containing an EcoRI site and an antisense sequence of the hMCD4 open reading frame (nucleotides 2770–2793)), and the human testis marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR fragment was cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen).

The fragment was cloned into pVT101U (pGZ175).RESULTSDevelopment of a Functional Screen to Identify Genes Involved in Nucleotide Release—The screen is based on the use of a yeast strain that is able to sense the presence of adenine nucleotides in the medium (Fig. 1A). We took advantage of the fact that the ade2 mutant strain of S. cerevisiae is not able to grow in an adenine-deficient medium. This strain cannot utilize exogenous adenosine and adenine nucleotides since yeast cells do not take up these molecules (31Maser P. Sutterlin C. Kralli A. Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, when nucleoside transporter TbAT1 was expressed in the strain, it was able to grow with adenosine as a sole purine source (Fig. 1B) (31Maser P. Sutterlin C. Kralli A. Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the modified yeast strain could also grow in the adenine-deficient medium when supplemented with AMP, ADP, or ATP (Fig. 1B) since adenine nucleotides can be hydrolyzed to adenosine by acid phosphatases at the cell surface (41Vogel J.P. Lee J.N. Kirsch D.R. Rose M.D. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3040-3043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the yeast strain developed a pink color when grown in these media, making it an ideal indicator for functional screening.Fig. 1Construction of adenine nucleotide-sensing yeast strain. A, diagram of the construction of adenine nucleotide-sensing yeast strain. Yeast cells defective in purine biosynthesis can utilize adenosine and adenine nucleotides as a sole purine source if they express an exogenous nucleoside transporter. B, growth of adenine nucleotide-sensing yeast strain in adenine-deficient medium supplemented with different adenine sources. RH407–6b cells carrying plasmid TbAT1 were streaked on synthetic minimal adenine/methionine drop-out medium plates containing 200 μm adenine, adenosine, AMP, ADP, or ATP as indicated.

Colonies from cells overexpressing ATP transporters or their activators were identified by a ring of small pink colonies representing the nucleotide-sensing cells that grew in the presence of adenosine (Fig. 2B). When cells of strain YMR4 that lack expression of periplasmic acid phosphatases (41Vogel J.P. Lee J.N. Kirsch D.R. Rose M.D. Sztul E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3040-3043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were transformed with one of the positive clones (called ATP1–3), they secreted six times more ATP than control yeast cells as measured with a luciferin/luciferase assay (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Functional screen for ATP transporters.

Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Yeast cells transformed with the pVT101U vector containing the MCD4 gene placed behind a constitutive promoter expressed Mcd4p (Fig. 3B, insert) and released 20 times more ATP than did cells transformed with vector alone (Fig. 3B). In cells containing a temperature-sensitive mutant of Mcd4p, mcd4–174 (kindly provided by Peter Orlean), ATP efflux was strongly reduced at semi-permissive temperature (Fig. 3C). In this figure, SEY6210 is the wild type strain, whereas GY1450 and GY1451 are two mcd4–174 mutant strains. Mcd4p-mediated ATP release was dependent on the presence of glucose (Fig. 3D), in accordance with the report that ATP release is stimulated by a rise in intracellular cAMP brought about by the addition of glucose to starved cells (18Boyum R. Guidotti G. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 19"
https://openalex.org/W2130637005,"A novel bo 3-type quinol oxidase was highly purified from Bacillus cereus PYM1, a spontaneous mutant unable to synthesize heme A and therefore spectroscopically detectable cytochromes aa 3 and caa 3. The purified enzyme contained 12.4 nmol of heme O and 11.5 nmol of heme B mg–1 protein. The enzyme was composed of two subunits with an M r of 51,000 and 30,000, respectively. Both subunits were immunoreactive to antibodies raised against the B cereus aa 3 oxidase. Moreover, amino-terminal sequence analysis of the 30-kDa subunit revealed that the first 19 residues were identical to those from the 30-kDa subunit of the B. cereus aa 3 oxidase. The purified bo 3 oxidase failed to oxidize ferrrocytochrome c (neither yeast nor horse) but oxidized tetrachlorohydroquinol with an apparent K m of 498 μm, a V max of 21 μmol of O2 min–1mg–1, and a calculated turnover of 55 s–1. The quinol oxidase activity with tetrachlorohydroquinol was inhibited by potassium cyanide and 2-n-heptyl 4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide with an I50 of 24 and 300 μm, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the bo 3 oxidase of this mutant is not the product of a new operon but instead is a cytochrome aa 3 apoprotein encoded by the qox operon of the aa 3 oxidase of B. cereus wild type promiscuously assembled with hemes B and O replacing heme A, producing a novel bo 3 cytochrome. This is the first reported example of an enzymatically active promiscuous oxidase resulting from the simultaneous substitution of its original hemes in the high and low spin sites.

This is the first reported example of an enzymatically active promiscuous oxidase resulting from the simultaneous substitution of its original hemes in the high and low spin sites. Bacteria have exploited unique terminal oxidases depending on the natural habitats and modes of aerobic metabolism (1Anraku Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In most cases, there is more than one terminal oxidase, so that the respiratory systems of bacteria are branched. According to the nature of the electron donor two types of terminal oxidases can readily be distinguished: the cytochrome c oxidases and the quinol oxidases (1Anraku Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additionally, terminal oxidases contain different heme prosthetic groups that have provided a customary way of identification (i.e. aa 3, bo 3, caa 3, bd, cbb 3, ba 3). However this classification is further complicated by the fact that under specific culture conditions (2Sone N. Kutoh E. Sato K. J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11435-11440Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), bacterial oxidases may be assembled promiscuously, accepting a different heme group to that present in its original structure. A single heme substitution (O replacing B) has been reported in the low spin heme site of cytochrome bo 3 of over-expressing strains of Escherichia coli, resulting in the assembly of a functional cytochrome, oo 3. It is noteworthy that the heme of the binuclear O2 reduction site was invariably heme O (6Puustinen A. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M. Thomas J.W. Gennis R.B. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10363-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, the substitution of heme O by heme B in the binuclear O2-reducing site in E. coli cyoE-deleted strains (cyoE encodes for farnesyl transferase that converts heme B to heme O) results in an inactive cytochrome bb 3 enzyme (10Hill J. Groswitz V. Calhoun M. García-Horsman A. Lemieux L. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11435-11440Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly Zikermann et al. (7Zickermann I. Tautu O.S. Link T.A. Korn M. Ludwing B. Richter H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported that in Paracoccus denitrificans ctaB-deleted strains (the ctaB gene is an orthologue of cyoE), a bb 3 variant of bo 3 oxidase is enzymatically inactive. Examples of heme substitutions in the high spin heme site producing functional enzymes have been reported in several bacterial species; for example a novel b(o/a)3 cytochrome c oxidase was purified from Bacillus stearothermophilus K17 mutants defective in caa 3-type oxidase (8Sakamoto J. Handa Y. Sone N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Likewise, the presence of a b(a/o)3-type oxidase was reported in Acetobacter aceti (5Matsushita K. Ebisuya H. Ameyama M. Adachi O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 122-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a ca(a/o)3-type oxidase was found in Bacillus PS3 (4Sone N. Fujiwara Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and an a(a/o)3-type oxidase was isolated from cyanobacteria (11Peschek G.A. Alge D. Fromwald S. Meyer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27937-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Auer G. Mayer B. Wastyn M. Fromwald S. Eghbalzad K. Alge D. Peschek G.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 1173-1185PubMed Google Scholar). Either heme A or O can be bound to the O2-reducing site depending on the growth conditions; high O2 tension favors the assembly with heme A, whereas O2-limited conditions lead to a promiscuous substitution of heme A by heme O. This in good agreement with the fact that the synthesis of heme A from heme O requires an oxidizing/oxygenizing reaction of heme O (13Saiki K. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Svensson B. Andersson K.K. Hederstedt L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, O2 limitation would favor the accumulation of heme O. Heme O is normally not present in the Bacillaceae family; however, the presence of heme O has been reported in wild type cells growing under limited aeration (3Quereshi M.H. Yumoto I. Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 408-485Google Scholar, 4Sone N. Fujiwara Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or in mutants deficient in the ctaA gene that encodes for the oxygenase responsible for the conversion of heme O into heme A (i.e. Bacillus subtilis RB829R (14Svensson B. Andersson K.K. Hederstedt L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) as well as, in other genetically uncharacterized (presumably ctaA) mutants (B. subtilis FG83 (15James W.S. Gibson F. Taroni P. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 58: 277-282Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Bacillus cereus PYM1 (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). In none of these mutants were any type a cytochromes spectroscopically detected; instead, the presence of a functional type o oxidase in membranes was suggested based on a spectral studies of CO-binding and O2 displacement upon photodissociation at subzero temperatures (15James W.S. Gibson F. Taroni P. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 58: 277-282Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Contreras M.L. Escamilla J.E. Del Arenal P. Dávila J.R. D'Mello R. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The nature of these novel oxidases was not further explored. Several promiscuous oxidases with single heme substitutions have been purified and characterized to varying extents (4Sone N. Fujiwara Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Puustinen A. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M. Thomas J.W. Gennis R.B. Wikström M.

To our knowledge, an enzymatically active promiscuous oxidase bearing double heme substitution has yet to be described. In this work, we report on the purification and characterization of a novel cytochrome bo 3 quinol oxidase from B. cereus PYM1. Our results indicate that the purified bo 3 oxidase is a promiscuous enzyme that arises from the simultaneous insertion of hemes B and O in the low and high spin sites, respectively, of the original aa 3 quinol oxidase apocytochrome. On the other hand, a functional promiscuous equivalent was not detected for the caa 3 apocytochrome in the PYM1 strain, thus suggesting that double heme substitution producing active variants is a rare event among oxidases. The molecular and kinetic properties of the promiscuous bo 3 oxidase were analyzed and compared with those of the original aa 3 oxidase. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—A B. cereus wild type strain originally isolated by Andreoli et al. (19Andreoli A.J. Suehiro S. Sakeyama D. Takemoto J. Vivanco E. Lara J.C. Klute M.C. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its spontaneous derivative, PYM1 (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), were used throughout this study. Bacterial cultures were grown at 30 °C in an 80-liter fermentor (Bioflo 5000, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) containing 60 liters of nutrient sporulation medium phosphate (20Hederstedt L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and stirred at 250 rpm with vigorous bubbling (60 liters of air min–1). Cells were harvested during sporulation at stage II (2 h into stationary phase), washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4, and resuspended (0.5 g of wet weight ml–1) in the same buffer. Membrane Isolation and Protein Purification—Procedures for mechanical disruption of cells and membrane isolation were carried out as reported previously (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For the present work, 0.1 mm phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride and one tablet of protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 100 ml of cell suspension were included. The procedure for the purification of the bo 3-like oxidase from PYM1 strain was similar to those used for the purification of the B. cereus oxidases aa 3 and caa 3 reported earlier, with minor modifications (21García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. González-Halphen D. Escamilla J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Escamilla J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This procedure consisted of a bile salt extraction (sonication) of membrane particles followed by a 4% Triton X-100 solubilization of the resulting membrane residues and a 30% polyethylene glycol 6000 precipitation of the light brown-colored supernatant obtained after centrifugation of the Triton X-100 fraction. The purification was continued by two steps of anionic-exchange column chromatography in the following order: DEAE-Sepharose CL6B, QAE-Toyopearl (Sigma), and finally a HA-Ultrogel (Sigma) chromatography column. All purifications steps were carried out with 0.1% Triton X-100 added to buffers. Fractions displaying heme absorption (405 nm) were analyzed for oxidase activity using N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylendiamine (TMPD) 1The abbreviations used are: TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylendiamine; TCHQ, tetrachorohydroquinol; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography. or tetrachlorohydroquinol (TCHQ) reduced with ascorbate as electron donors. Those fractions containing activity were pooled and precipitated with 30% polyethylene glycol 6000 and resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl (potassium phosphate for HA Ultrogel column), pH 8.0, containing 10 μg ml–1 of azolectin. All purification was performed at 4 °C. Spectroscopic Analysis—Conventional optical absorption difference spectra were recorded at room temperature in an SLM-Aminco DW 2000 spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments Inc.) using a 1-cm light path cuvettes. Samples were reduced with solid sodium dithionite, whereas references were oxidized with air (1 min of vortex agitation). The CO-cytochrome complexes were obtained by bubbling reduced preparations with CO during 5 min. An extinction coefficient of 22 mm–1 cm–1 for cytochrome b (555–575 nm) was used in the reduced minus oxidized spectra and of 160 mm–1 cm–1 (417–432 nm) for the cytochrome o CO adduct (17Contreras M.L. Escamilla J.E. Del Arenal P. Dávila J.R. D'Mello R. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Photodissociation Spectroscopy—The purified preparation of cytochrome bo 3-like (50 μg of protein) was lyophilized, then resuspended in aqueous 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol solution, and reduced by the addition of a few grains of dithionite in a 2-mm light path cuvette. The anoxic preparation was bubbled with CO for 5 min and then frozen in an ethanol-solid CO2 bath at 195 K for at least 5 min in the dark prior further cooling to 77 K in the sample compartment of the dual wavelength SLM-Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. The sample was scanned twice between 400 and 750 nm (using 500 nm as the reference wavelength), and the difference was plotted to obtain the base line. The frozen sample was then photolysed with three flashes of a photographic flash placed a few centimeters away from the window of the cuvette, and then the post-photolysis spectrum was obtained. The photodissociation difference spectrum of heme-CO compounds was obtained by subtracting the pre-photolysis spectrum from the post-photolysis spectrum (23Poole R.K. Waring A.J. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Poole R.K. Salmon I. Chance B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic and Western Blot Analyses—To decrease Triton X-100 content in purified preparations of cytochrome bo 3-like, samples were passed through a 0.3 × 5-cm Bio-Beads SM-2 column (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed using a 10–16% gradient of acrylamide containing 2% SDS as described previously (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Half of the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (G-250, Sigma), and the other half was used for Western blot analyses with rabbit antiserum raised against B. cereus cytochrome aa 3 as described previously (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) Amino-terminal Sequence—Purified aa 3- and bo 3-like oxidases from wild type and PYM1 strains, respectively, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic transfer of proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 70: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Both proteins were sequenced by automated Edman degradation using a Beckman Spherogel Micro PTH (2 × 150 mm) column and a sequencer phase-gas (LF 3000, Beckman Instruments) equipped with a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) Gold system and a 168 photodiode array detector setting at 268 and 293 nm for signal and reference, respectively. Respiratory Activities—Oxidase activity was determined polarographically at 30 °C in a YSI model 53 oxygen meter (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH) as described previously (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), using either 0.1 mm TMPD or 3.3 mm TCHQ reduced with 2.5 mm ascorbate. Heme Analysis—Hemes were determined in a Waters chromatography system equipped with a Waters model 996 photodiode array detector and Waters Delta-Pak HPLC18 300° A (2 × 150 mm) reverse-phase HPLC column (MetaChem Technologies, Inc.). Hemes were eluted from the column by acetonitrile gradient in water containing 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and detected by their absorbance at 405 nm as described previously (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Heme preparations were extracted and purified from membranes or from the fractions obtained during each of the purification steps. Samples used for heme extraction were previously passed through a column of Bio-Beads. Other Methods—Protein concentration was determined according to the method described by Lowry and modified by Markwell et al. (26Markwell M.A.K. Hass S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Purification of the bo 3 -like Oxidase from B. cereus PYM1— The preparation obtained after solubilization of membrane components by Triton X-100, was subjected to anionic-exchange chromatography in a DEAE-Sepharose CL6B column (15 × 7 cm). Two heme-containing fractions were separated, one of which was not adsorbed by the column and contained cytochromes b and c as judged by its reduced minus oxidized difference spectra (not shown). This fraction had a CO difference spectrum displaying typical absorbance bands for cytochrome type o (peak at 417 and trough at 427 nm). However, after HPLC analysis, the presence of heme O was not sustained, and only heme B was confirmed (data not shown). Moreover, this fraction did not present oxidase activity when either TMPD or TCHQ (reduced with ascorbate) were used as electron donors. By contrast, the equivalent chromatographic fraction from extracts of the wild type strain of B. cereus contained TMPD oxidase activity, and as reported earlier (22García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Escamilla J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), further purification of this fraction confirmed the presence of cytochrome caa 3 (not shown). A second heme-containing fraction was eluted at a linear gradient of 175 mm NaCl (0–600 mm). This peak showed quinol oxidase activity with TCHQ. The reduced minus oxidized (peaks at 427, 555, and 562 nm) and CO difference spectra (peaks at 415, 538, and 573, troughs at 426 and 556 nm) of this fraction suggested the presence of b- and o-type cytochromes. After HPLC analysis we confirmed the presence of heme B (retention time of 27.5 min) and heme O (retention time of 34 min) in a 1:0.25 ratio (data not shown). Fractions containing TCHQ oxidase activity were pooled and precipitated with 30% polyethylene glycol 6000. The resuspended pellet was applied to a QAE-Toyopearl column. A fraction associated to cytochrome bo 3-like was eluted at a linear gradient of 200 mm NaCl (0–600 mm). This peak contained TCHQ oxidase activity and the spectrally detectable cytochrome o CO adduct (data not shown). Fractions containing activity were precipitated as described above and applied to a HA-Ultrogel column to accomplish the purification to homogeneity of the cytochrome bo 3 -like of B. cereus PYM1. The enzyme was eluted at a linear gradient (0–500 mm)of65mm potassium phosphate buffer (Fig. 1A). The CO difference spectrum of the dithionite reduced preparation (Fig. 1B) and its HPLC analysis (Fig. 1C) confirmed the presence of cytochrome bo 3-like in the purified preparation. A concentration of 11.5 and 12.4 nmol mg protein–1 for cytochromes b and o, respectively, was calculated from the dithionite reduced minus air oxidized difference and the CO difference spectra, respectively (Tables I and II). These results strongly suggest a mol-to-mol ratio between cytochromes b and o in the bo 3 -like oxidase of B. cereus PYM1. The results of the purification are summarized in Table I. The chromatographic behavior described for cytochrome bo 3-like of the PYM1 strain was similar to that described previously for a cytochrome aa 3 of the wild type strain (21García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. González-Halphen D. Escamilla J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Escamilla J.E. Eur. J.

Open table in a new tab Characterization of the bo 3 -like Oxidase from Bacillus cereus PYM1—SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A) of the purified cytochrome bo 3-like showed two subunits with apparent molecular masses of 51 and 30 kDa, respectively. This result resembles that of the cytochrome oxidase aa 3 subunit composition found in B. cereus wild type strain (i.e. 51 and 30 kDa (21García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. González-Halphen D. Escamilla J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)). Apoprotein Analysis—Because the apparent molecular masses of the subunits of the purified cytochrome bo 3 of B. cereus PYMI were closer to those reported for the quinol oxidase aa 3 of B. cereus (i.e. 51 and 30 kDa (21García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. González-Halphen D. Escamilla J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) than to those reported for a typical cytochrome bo 3 of E. coli (i.e. 58, 33, 22, and 17 kDa) (27Carter-Minghetti K. Chepuri-Goswitz V. Gabriel N.E. Hill J.J. Barassi C.A. Georgiou C.D. Chan S.I. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6917-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)), we decided to test whether these polypeptides were indeed aa 3 subunits by carrying out Western immunoblotting analyses using anti-aa 3 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, the two bands present in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) reacted to the anti-aa 3 antibodies (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the apoprotein present in the purified cytochrome bo 3-like from PYM1 strain is in fact the apoprotein from cytochrome oxidase aa 3. Importantly, Coomassie staining and Western analyses were consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 2). Amino-terminal Sequence—To further confirm the identity of the purified bo 3-like oxidase, the amino-terminal sequences of the 51- and 30-kDa subunits of both wild type aa 3- and PYM1 bo 3-oxidases were determined and compared. We failed to sequence the major subunits of both enzymes because their amino-terminal ends were blocked. By contrast, the sequence found for the amino-terminal ends of the 30-kDa subunits of both wild type and PYM enzymes were identical, LAVLNPQGPVAKXQYDLIV. The sequence is highly identical (i.e. 68–73%; www.ncbi.nlm/blast) to the homologous fragment comprising residues 26–46 of subunit II of quinol oxidases aa 3 of B. subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Listeria inocua, and Listeria monocytogenes; and more importantly, the sequence determined here is 94% identical to the homologous fragment present in the very recently released genome sequence of B. cereus AATCC14579 (GenBank™ accession number AE016877). This result demonstrates unequivocally that the cytochrome bo 3 purified here is indeed a promiscuous variant of the aa 3 apocytochrome of B. cereus. Photodissociation Spectra Analyses—CO-complex spectra (as in Fig. 1B) reveal all CO-reactive hemoproteins, including hydroperoxidases and globins as well as putative oxidases. Terminal oxidases in general exhibit relatively slow CO recombination kinetics at subzero temperatures. Accordingly, the dissociated CO is trapped by a Cu proximal to the heme Fe to which CO has been attached (6Puustinen A. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M. Thomas J.W. Gennis R.B. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10363-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) allowing the recording of the photodissociation spectra. Here the cytochrome bo 3-CO complex was photodissociated at 77 K according to experimental procedures. The resulting spectrum showed troughs at 415, 553, and 563 nm; two peaks were present, a prominent peak at 430 nm and the other at 557 nm (Fig. 3). These absorbance maxima arise from the generation of the unligated, reduced cytochrome following dissociation of CO. The spectrum was stable with time, indicating a negligible slow recombination of CO at this cryogenic temperature. Such spectral features and a slow CO recombination kinetics have been reported for cytochrome bo 3 in E. coli (24Poole R.K. Salmon I. Chance B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and cytochrome bo 3 -like of B. cereus (17Contreras M.L. Escamilla J.E. Del Arenal P. Dávila J.R. D'Mello R. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) where the half-times for CO recombination at 168 K were 47 min and 22 min, respectively. Catalytic Activity—Pure preparations of cytochrome bo 3 were able to oxidize quinol (TCHQ) but failed to oxidize ferrocytochrome c (neither yeast nor horse), revealing it as a quinol oxidase. The enzyme showed a hyperbolic kinetic pattern of response to increasing concentrations of TCHQ with an apparent K m for reduced TCHQ of 498 μm and a V max of 21 μmol of O2 min–1mg–1, and the calculated turnover with TCHQ was 55 s–1 (Table II). The turnover value is within the reported range for other bacterial oxidases like the co 3 oxidase of Methylophilus methylotrophus (21 s–1 (28Froud S. Anthony C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 2201-2212Google Scholar)), the promiscuous cao 3 oxidase of Bacillus PS3 (122 s–1 (4Sone N. Fujiwara Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)), the novel b(o/a)3 oxidase of B. stearothermophilus (190 s–1 (8Sakamoto J. Handa Y. Sone N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), and remarkably, the aa 3 oxidase of B. cereus (100 s–1 (21García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. González-Halphen D. Escamilla J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)). The quinol oxidase activity was inhibited by KCN with an I50 of 24 μm, nearly the reported sensitivity of the original oxidase aa 3 of B. cereus wild type strain (10 μm (21García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. González-Halphen D. Escamilla J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) and the novel oxidase b(o/a)3 of B. stearothermophilus (19 μm (8Sakamoto J. Handa Y. Sone N. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, 2-n-heptyl 4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide fully inhibited the TCHQ oxidase activity of the purified bo 3-like cytochrome. The calculated I50 for 2-n-heptyl 4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide was 300 μm, a concentration significantly lower than that required to inhibit (i.e. K i = 1.7 mm) the ubiquinone-1 oxidase activity of cytochrome bo 3 of E. coli (29Sato-Watabe M. Mogi T. Miyoshi H. Anraku Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5356-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Heme O in B. cereus Wild Type—Thus far, our results demonstrate that in the PYM1 spontaneous mutant lacking heme A, the aa 3 apoprotein has the ability to carry hemes B and O, resulting in a functional promiscuous bo 3-like cytochrome. Our previous studies in B. cereus wild type strain showed that cells obtained from well aerated cultures lack heme O (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in Bacillus PS3 showed that only under O2-limited cultures, cytochrome o 3 replaces cytochrome a 3 in the O2-reducing site of the oxidase caa 3 (2Sone N. Kutoh E. Sato K. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 547-602Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore it was interesting to know whether or not heme O is accumulating under O2-limiting culture conditions in B. cereus wild type strain, thus enabling the promiscuous assembly of cytochrome o-like oxidases. HPLC analyses confirmed the presence of hemes B (retention time, 27.5 min) and A (retention time, 32 min) in membranes of wild type cells grown under vigorous aeration (Fig. 4A). No heme O (retention time, 34 min) was detected in these membranes. On the other hand, membranes obtained from cells grown under O2-limited conditions showed a different picture (Fig. 4B): Although heme B was present in a concentration comparable with that of cells from well aerated cultures, the concentration of heme A was significantly lower. Indeed, heme A is seen as a small shoulder in the new peak formed by heme O. A ratio of 1:0.13 was calculated for the concentrations of heme O and A, respectively, in cells obtained from O2-limited cultures. The above results support our prediction that the decrease in the oxygen availability promotes the accumulation of heme O and probably the promiscuity of cytochromes originally containing heme A. Many reports have suggested that the promiscuous assembly of terminal oxidases may be a general phenomenon in bacteria, promoted by different culture conditions or as a consequence of specific mutations (2Sone N.

In most cases, hemes O and A replace each other in the high spin site of the binuclear center, producing functional enzymes with somewhat different kinetic properties (2Sone N. Kutoh E. Sato K. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 547-602Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 4Sone N. Fujiwara Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Matsushita K. Ebisuya H. Adachi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24748-24753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the membrane-bound bo 3-like oxidase purified here has a very high affinity for oxygen (K m = 8.4 nm; (17Contreras M.L. Escamilla J.E. Del Arenal P. Dávila J.R. D'Mello R. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). Promiscuous replacements in the low spin site of terminal oxidases have been reported only in E. coli, where the heme B associated to the oxidase bo 3 can be replaced by heme O to produce a functional oxidase oo 3 (6Puustinen A. Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M. Thomas J.W. Gennis R.B. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10363-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an active promiscuous oxidase resulting from the simultaneous substitution of its original hemes in the high and low spin sites. Therefore, it is highly relevant that the bo 3-like oxidase purified from B. cereus PYM1 strain was in fact a promiscuous oxidase related to the original aa 3 enzyme characterized previously (21García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. González-Halphen D. Escamilla J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by their similar oligomeric structure, the inmunoreactivity of the bo 3 subunits against the B. cereus aa 3 antiserum, and more importantly, the identical NH2-terminal sequences including the first 19 residues of the 30-kDa subunits of both enzymes. According to the spectroscopic analyses (Figs. 1 and 3, Table I), the purified bo 3-like oxidase contains one molecule of each of cytochromes b and o. Because the suitability of heme O replacing heme A in the high spin site has been documented for several oxidases (2Sone N. Kutoh E. Sato K. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 547-602Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3Quereshi M.H. Yumoto I. Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 408-485Google Scholar, 4Sone N. Fujiwara Y.

Escamilla J.E. Del Arenal P. Dávila J.R. D'Mello R. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we propose that the promiscuous enzyme purified here bears cytochrome o in the oxygen reduction site and therefore that cytochrome b should be bound to the low spin site. The occupation of the low spin site by heme B in the PYM1 apocytochrome aa 3 is rather unexpected. There are no previous reports showing an enzymatically active promiscuous oxidase in which heme B replaces the original heme A in either the low or high spin sites. The hydroxy-farnesyl-ethyl group of heme A in the low spin site is almost in the extended conformation, acting as a hydrophobic anchor held by the helical structure of the enzyme (30Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashiota E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 31Riistama S. Verkhovsky M.I. Laakkonen L. Wikström M. Puustinen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This interaction is an important structural feature but one that seems not to be crucial for the activity of the PYM1 promiscuous cytochrome bo 3. The wild type strain of B. cereus contains two terminal oxidases bearing heme A: cytochromes aa 3 and caa 3 (21García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. González-Halphen D. Escamilla J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Escamilla J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Once solubilized from membranes, these cytochromes are readily separated each from other by an anionic-exchange chromatography step, because the caa 3 enzyme is not retained by the column (22García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Escamilla J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although we demonstrated previously that the 37.5-kDa cytochrome c-subunit of the caa 3 enzyme is present in the membranes of PYM 1 strain in amounts comparable to those detected in the wild type strain (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we might conclude that a functional promiscuous variant of the caa 3 apocytochrome seems not to be present in the PYM1 strain based on the following: 1) we could not confirm the presence of oxidase activity (TMPD oxidase) attributable to a promiscuous variant (i.e. cbo 3) of the original caa 3 enzyme; and 2) heme O was not detected by HPLC in the chromatographic fractions that contained cytochrome c (not shown). Perhaps the double heme substitution is not functionally permissive for the caa 3 apocytochrome. The purification and prosthetic group analyses of this enzyme from the PYM1 strain warrant further study. It has been shown that in B. subtilis as well as in B. cereus the oxidase caa 3 is induced during early stages of sporulation (22García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Escamilla J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Lauraeus M. Halüa T. Saraste M. Wikström M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It seems that this oxidase is mainly responsible for the respiration burst observed during early sporulation stages and the rapid removal of organic acids accumulated during growth in fermentable media, thus leading to avoidance of excessive medium acidification. The lack of an active promiscuous variant of the oxidase caa 3 in B. cereus PYM1 strain would explain the phenotype reported earlier (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), consisting of low TMPD oxidase activity, lack of a respiration burst, an excessive acidification of the medium, and the consequent asporogenic behavior shown in normal fermentable media. Raising the buffer capacity of the media restores normal growth and recovery of sporulation to levels comparable with the wild type strain (16Del Arenal I.P. Contreras M.L. Svaeteorova B.B. Rangel O. Dávila J.R. Lledías F. Escamilla J.E. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, B. cereus wild type strain grown under microaerophilic conditions displayed a severe decrease in the concentration of membrane-bound heme A, compensated for by an accumulation of heme O (Fig. 4). This condition would promote the assembly of promiscuous variants of the original cytochromes aa 3 and caa 3, containing different heme formulae, depending on the availability of heme A. Consistently it has been shown that in the Bacillus PS3, O2-limited growth promotes the promiscuous assembly of the enzymatically active cytochrome cao 3 instead of the original cytochrome caa 3. Here, we have demonstrated that under the extreme condition of lack of heme A, the aa 3 oxidase is replaced by its active and promiscuous bo 3 variant. However, under physiological conditions in which O2 becomes limited, a dynamic variation in the promiscuous assembly of oxidases may be a common event resulting in some variants becoming inactive but others possessing kinetic properties more suitable for microaerophilic life.

Transient transfection assays indicate that the segment from –199 to +1 is necessary for the activation of basal transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that the ATTGG sequence, within the –147 to –121 fragment, is critical to bind nuclear proteins in the proximal COL11A1 promoter. We demonstrated that the CCAAT binding factor (CBF/NF-Y) bound to this region using an interference assay with consensus oligonucleotides and a supershift assay with specific antibodies in an EMSA. In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and EMSA using DNA-affinity-purified proteins, CBF/NF-Y proteins directly bound this region in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that four tandem copies of the CBF/NF-Y-binding fragment produced higher transcriptional activity than one or two copies, whereas the absence of a CBF/NF-Y-binding fragment suppressed the COL11A1 promoter activity. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative CBF-B/NF-YA subunit significantly inhibited promoter activity in both transient and stable cells. These results indicate that the CBF/NF-Y proteins regulate the transcription of COL11A1 by directly binding to the ATTGG sequence in the proximal promoter region.

The collagen superfamily, one of the extracellular matrix proteins, plays an important role, not only in stabilizing the tissues as structural components but also in regulating a variety of biological functions, such as development, differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis (1Olsen B.R.

Among them, types I, II, III, V, and XI collagens are included in the group of fibril-forming collagens, based on their structural and functional features, and are divided into two subgroups, major (I, II and III) and minor (V and XI) fibrillar collagen (4Fichard A. Kleman J.-P. Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 515-531Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar) on the basis of their contents in tissues. Type XI collagen is a component of the collagen fibrillar network found in cartilage (5Burgeson R.E. Hollister D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and consists of three genetically distinct polypeptide chains: α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI); the last of these is thought to be overglycosylated α1(II) chains (6Burgeson R.E. Hebda P. Morris N. Hollister D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7852-7856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although type XI collagen is a relatively minor collagen and is buried within the major collagen fibrils, it is important for the regulation of fibril diameter (7Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Chondrodysplasia mice (cho), which do not synthesize α1(XI) chains, show irregular collagen fibrils in their cartilage (8Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T.

Dyn. 1995; 204: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and it was demonstrated that the α1(XI) chain could form a heterotrimer with the α2(V) chain in a 2:1 ratio in non-cartilaginous cells and tissues (15Kleman J.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9381-9386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise function of this cross-type trimer remains unclear, the α1(XI) collagen gene is more broadly expressed than other collagen genes, showing that the α1(XI) collagen gene is the sole collagen gene to be expressed in both cartilaginous and non-cartilaginous tissues. This implies that the regulation of the α1(XI) collagen gene might be more complex than expected. We have previously reported the structural and functional features of the human α1(XI) collagen gene (COL11A1) promoter (17Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S. Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y.

DNase I footprinting has mapped nine areas, FP1 to FP9, covering the region –541 to +1, where nuclear proteins probably bind. In characterizing the –541 to –199 segment, FP9-protein, which has homology to the GATA consensus motif and binds at –531 to –487, was recognized to be a distinct +100-kDa polypeptide (18Kinoshita A.

It was expressed in mesenchymal cells, and its level of binding activity was positively correlated with the degree of cell differentiation in osteoblastic and skeletal muscle cell lines, in vitro. At –395 to –379, the core sequence of FP7 exhibits some homology with that of FPB 1The abbreviations used are: FPB, Foot Printing B; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; CBF, CCAAT binding factor; wt, wild type; CTF, CCAAT transcription factor; NF-Y, nuclear factor for Y box. in COL5A2, and FP7-protein complexes can be competed with an excess of FPB oligonucleotides in an EMSA using nuclear extracts from the 1120 cell line (17Yoshioka H.

Further studies using transfection experiments and EMSAs in A204 cells, however, indicated that the FPB-protein complexes identified were PBX, PREP and HOX proteins and therefore different from the FP7-binding proteins (20Penkov D.

In this study, we have characterized the region downstream of the –541 to –199 region in the human COL11A1 promoter. Transient transfection assays indicate that the segment from –199 to +1 is necessary for the activation of basal transcription, and EMSAs demonstrate that the ATTGG sequence within the –147 to –121 fragment is critical for binding nuclear proteins.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heart-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sanko Junyaku, Tokyo) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2/95% air. Construction of Chimeric Plasmids—Essentially, all COL11A1 promoter-luciferase gene constructs were derived from –1454 COL11A1/CAT plasmid that fused to the CAT gene as described previously (17Yoshioka H. Greenwel P. Inoguchi K. Truter S. Inagaki Y. Ninomiya Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 418-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To obtain various 5′ deletion constructs, these fragments were generated by PCR using sets of oligonucleotide primers, which are SacI site-linked 5′- and XhoI site-linked 3′-primers specific for the promoter sequence. These PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by digestion with SacI and XhoI, and subcloned into the SacI/XhoI site of pGL3-Basic vector. The constructs that contained tandem fragments, PGL3(–199/–65)x2 and pGL3(–147/–121)x4, were chosen. Their DNA sizes were checked on agarose gel, and the direction of the constructs was confirmed by sequence. For internal deletion and mutation constructs, site-directed mutagenesis was apply (21Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The constructs were derived from pGL3–541/+271 plasmid. For 6 base-substitution, we introduced EcoRI sequence, GAATTC, for substitution sites. The primers for 6 base-substitution constructs, pGL3–541E1, pGL3–541E2, pGL3–541E3, and pGL3–541E4, were as follows: E1: sense, 5′-gaattcTGGGTCTGACCCTCAGCCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-gaattcCGACTCTGGGGCGGCCCCAA-3′; E2: sense, 5′-gaattcCTCAGCCTGCTTGTCAGTTT-3′; antisense, 5′-gaattcACCCAATCACACGACTCTGG-3′; E3: sense, 5′-gaattcTGTGATTGGGTCTGACCCTC-3′; antisense, 5′-gaattcTGGGGCGGCCCCAAGCCCGC-3′; and E4: sense, 5′-gaattcCTGACCCTCAGCCTGCTTGT-3′; antisense, 5′-gaattcTCACACGACTCTGGGGCGG-3′ (the EcoRI sites for mutation are indicated by lowercase letters). PCR products were digested with EcoRI, followed by self-ligation. All mutagenesis plasmids were digested with SacI and XhoI and re-cloned into the SacI/XhoI site of pGL3-Basic vector. The primers for pGL3–541CBFm, pGL3-del–147/–121, and pGL3-del–199/–65 were as follows: for CBF mutant construct pGL3–541CBFm: sense, GaaATacGggCTGACCCTCAGCCTGCTT; antisense, ccCgtATttCACGACTCTGGGGCGGCCC (mutated nucleotides are indicated by lowercase letters); for deletion construct pGL3-del-147/–121: sense, 5′-AGCCTGCTTGTCAGTTTCGC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGGGCGGCCCCAAGCCCGCC-3′; for deletion construct pGL3-del–199/–65: sense, 5′-GGCGGAGGAGGGGGCTGCCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAGCAGGCCCAGCCCACCAA-3′. Construct of the dominant-negative CBF-B/NF-YA was generated by reverse transcriptase PCR as described previously (22Mantovani R. Li X.-Y. Pessara U. van Huisjduijnen R.H. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lok C.-N. Lang A.J. Mirski S.E.L. Cole S.P.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 742-751Crossref Google Scholar). Two sets of primers were as follows: for 5′-CBF-B/NF-YAmut: sense, 5′-gtcgacGGAGGGACCATGGAGCAGTATA-3′; antisense, 5′-GCGGCCGCCTTCCGTGCCATGGCATGAC-3′, and for 3′-CBF-B/NF-YAmut: sense, 5′-GCGGCCGCAGGTGGACGATTTTTCTCTC-3′; antisense, 5′-tctagaGGGTTAGGACACTCGGATGATC-3′ (functional mutated nucleotides are indicated by lowercase letters.) These PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and subcloned into the SalI/NotI site for 5′-CBF-B/NF-YA mut, followed by NotI/XbaI site for 3′-CBF-B/NF-YAmut into the empty vector. Finally, this dominant-negative form of CBF-B/NF-YA was cloned into pCXN2 mammalian expression vector (24Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4616) Google Scholar). All constructs mentioned above were sequenced on an ABI 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—The cells were inoculated at a density of 2 × 105 per 35-mm dish 24 h before transfection. For transient transfection, each of plasmid DNA was transfected into these cells by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method followed by a 15% glycerol shock for 60 s (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). After an additional cultivation for 48 h, the transfected cells were harvested, lysed, centrifuged to pellet the debris and performed to luciferase assay as described below. For stable transfection, 1 μg of pGL3–199/+271 or pGL3(–147/–121)x4 luciferase construct with 50 ng of pMAM2-BSD selection vector were transfected into A204 cells by using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent system (Invitrogen) and cultured for 48 h. These transfected cells were replated at a density of 1 × 103 per 100-mm dish with fresh medium containing 8 μg/ml of blasticidin (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan). After an additional cultivation for 2 weeks, the resistant colonies were isolated and further cultured in the present of blasticidin, followed by assayed the luciferase activity to select stable cell lines. Luciferase activities were assayed by the Dual-LuciferaseTM Reporter Assay System according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI) using a luminometer (Lumat L.D. 9507; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Five micrograms of firefly luciferase reporter construct and/or dominant-negative CBF-B/NF-YA expression vector were cotransfected with 0.25 μg of pRL-TK Renilla reniformis luciferase expression vector as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The pGL3-Basic and pGL3-Control vectors were used for each experiment as negative and positive controls, respectively. Relative luciferase activities (percentages) of each construct were normalized against the activity of pGL3-Control vector and results were expressed as mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (26Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) with some modifications. All buffers contained the protease inhibitors leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (2 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), and dithiothreitol (1 mm). Cells (1 × 108) were resuspended in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), followed by incubation on ice for 10 min and homogenized. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, the cell pellets were resuspended in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 420 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol) and rotated at 4 °Cfor1h.The supernatants with nuclear proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 30 min, and protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined by the Bradford's colorimetric reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Wild-type and mutant probes derived from COL11A1 promoter fragment were generated by PCR using each set of HindIII site-linked primers, and all PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Both sense and antisense oligonucleotides of the mutant fragments covering –147 to –121, CBFwt, CBFmt, NF-1, C/EBP, and GATA consensus overhanging HindIII sites at the ends were synthesized (Proligo Japan KK, Kyoto, Japan), annealed to make double-stranded oligonucleotides, digested with HindIII, and cloned into the HindIII site of pBluescript SK vector. The CBFwt, CBFmt, NF-1, C/EBP, and GATA consensus sequences, based on the data from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., used as competitors, were as follows: CBFwt, 5′-AGACCGTACGTGATTGGTTAATCTCTT-3′; CBFmt5′-AGACCGTACGAAATACGGGAATCTCTT-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined); NF-Y, 5′-TTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA-3′; C/EBP, 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′; and GATA, 5′-CACTTGATAACAGAAAGTGATAACTCT-3′. All plasmids were digested with HindIII and the digested fragments were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment to fill in the HindIII overhang sites. For EMSA, the binding reaction was performed for 30 min at 25 °C in 25 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 250 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol) containing 20,000–30,000 cpm of labeled probe, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1–20 μg of nuclear extracts. For competitors and antibody interference assay, unlabeled probes or antibody was added to the reaction mixture for 1 h at 4 °C before the addition of [α-32P]dCTP labeled probe. These antibodies against CBF-A/NF-YB, CBF-B/NF-YB, CBF-C/NF-YC, C/EBP, NF-1, GATA-1, and pre-immune goat IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris-borate/EDTA with 2.5% glycerol at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography using Bio Imaging Analyzer BAS-2000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Purification of DNA Binding Protein Using DNA Affinity Latex Beads—DNA affinity latex beads were prepared as described previously (27Inomata Y. Kawaguchi H. Hiramoto M. Wada Y. Handa H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To purify DNA binding proteins, the DNA-latex beads were added to the nuclear extracts and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, the beads were washed three times with 0.1× buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl. pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.1 m KCl. To elute the binding proteins from the DNA-latex beads, the beads were resuspended in 0.4× buffer A containing 0.4 m KCl and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant containing DNA binding proteins was recovered and concentrated by microcon-10 (Millipore). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All solutions were contained with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. A204 cells were inoculated at a density of 1 × 106 per 100-mm dish 16 h before formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing twice with PBS, cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and sonicated four times for 10 s using ultrasonic homogenizer VP-5S (TAITEC, Tokyo, Japan). After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted in chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CBF-A/NF-YB, CBF-B/NF-YA, and CBF-C/NF-YC antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were recovered by the addition of 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry, followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with both low- and high-salt buffer, then LiCl buffer, and finally Tris/EDTA buffer, the immune complexes were eluted by incubation for 15 min at 25 °C with 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). To reverse the cross-linking of DNA, the elutes were added to 8 μl of 5 m NaCl and incubated for 4 h at 65 °C, followed by treatment with proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was recovered by phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and then the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer. Quantitative PCR was carried out for 35 cycles using 5 μl of sample DNA solution, and PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels in 1× Tris-acetate/EDTA. Deletion Analysis of the Human COL11A1 Promoter—To delineate the proximal regulatory regions in the human COL11A1 promoter, a series of chimeric constructs containing 5′-end deletions linked to the luciferase gene were generated, and then luciferase assays were carried out (Fig. 1A). The activity of each construct was compared with the longest construct, pGL3–291/+271. As shown in Fig. 1B, the promoter activity of pGL3–199/+271 was not significantly reduced compared with that of pGL3–291/+271. However, deletion to –88 produced a significant reduction in the transcriptional activity; furthermore, deletion to +1 produced activity similar to that of the pGL3-Basic negative control vector. This result indicates that the segment spanning the –199 to +1 region is important for basal transcriptional activity of the human COL11A1 promoter. Definition of the Nuclear Proteins Binding Site in the Proximal COL11A1 Promoter—On the basis of the aforementioned data, we examined the binding proteins that interact in this region. We prepared three overlapping oligonucleotides, GS1–GS3, covering the –199 to +1 region (Fig. 2A), and carried out EMSAs. As shown in Fig. 2B, 32P-labeled GS2 probe, covering –147 to –65, and GS3 probe, covering –199 to –121, bound nuclear proteins extracted from A204 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Both probes were found to form DNA-protein complexes with the same mobility in an EMSA. To determine whether GS2 and GS3 oligonucleotides bind the same proteins, these probes were used with each other in a competition assay. The 32P-labeled GS2-protein complexes could be competed away not only by the corresponding unlabeled probe (Fig. 2C, lane 4), but also by the unlabeled GS3 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2C, lane 5). Likewise, the 32P-labeled GS3-specific band also disappeared when either unlabeled GS3 or GS2 oligonucleotides were added as competitors (Fig. 2C, lanes 9 and 10); however, an excess of the unlabeled GS1 (–88 to +1) oligonucleotides did not compete for the binding of 32P-labeled GS2 and GS3 probes (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 8). To further dissect this protein-binding region, another three oligonucleotides covering the GS2 and GS3 regions were generated (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2D shows that 32P-labeled GS4 probe, covering –147 to –121, formed DNA-protein complexes in a dose-dependent manner. However, neither 32P-labeled GS5 nor GS6 probes, which do not possess the GS4 region, could bind protein. These results indicate that a 27-bp sequence from –147 to –121 in the proximal COL11A1 promoter region is necessary to bind nuclear proteins. We subsequently carried out EMSAs using substitution mutation probes within the 27-bp sequence to narrow down the critical region for binding (Fig. 3A). The 32P-labeled GSE1 and GSE4 probes, which contain 6 single bp substitutions, could not form DNA-protein complexes, whereas the 32P-labeled GSE2, GSE3, and GSwt probes bound protein in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, Fig. 3C shows that an excess of the unlabeled GSE2 and GSE3 probes inhibited the binding activity in a manner similar to that of GSwt, whereas both GSE1 and GSE4 could not compete with the 32P-labeled GSwt-specific band. To confirm a core-binding site, we further performed competition experiments using oligonucleotides with 2 single bp mutations. As shown in Fig. 3D, an excess of unlabeled GSM1, GSM2, GSM3, and GSM4 failed to inhibit the binding, whereas GSM5 and GSM6 blocked the binding of nuclear proteins (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the GTGATTGG sequence within the 27-bp region was the critical binding site within the proximal COL11A1 promoter.Fig. 3Definition of the nuclear protein-binding region in the proximal COL11A1 promoter by EMSA.

In the mutated probes, identical and mutated nucleotides are indicated by dots and lowercase letters, respectively. B, binding assay using substituted mutation probes. 32P-labeled GSwt (lanes 1–3), GSE1 (lanes 4–6), GSE2 (lanes 7–9), GSE3 (lanes 10 –12), and GSE4 (lanes 13–15) were incubated with nuclear extracts from A204 cells and separated on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel.

D, interference assays using 2 single bp substituted mutation probes as competitors. 32P-labeled GSwt was incubated with nuclear extract from A204 cells in the presence of competitors GSwt (lane 3) and GSM1-6 (lane 4–9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of DNA-Binding Proteins in the Proximal COL11A1 Promoter—To identify the nuclear binding proteins in the proximal COL11A1 promoter, we searched the computer data base and found four candidate transcription factors: CCAAT binding factor CBF/NF-Y, CCAAT transcription factor NF-1/CTF, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein C/EBP, and GATA (Fig. 4A). An excess of the consensus oligonucleotides of CBF/NF-Y inhibited the binding of the 32P-labeled GSwt probe (Fig. 4B, lane 2), whereas NF-1, C/EBF, GATA consensus, and CBFmt oligonucleotides could not abolish the binding activity observed (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–6). To further characterize the binding protein, we performed an interference assay using specific antibodies against CBF/NF-Y, NF-Y, C/EBP, and GATA1. As shown in Fig. 4C, the DNA-protein complex was only supershifted by anti-CBF antibodies, namely anti-CBF-A/NF-YB (Fig. 4C, lane 3), CBF-B/NF-YA (Fig. 4C, lane 4), and CBF-C/NF-YC (Fig. 4C, lane 5). Specific antibodies against the other proteins (Fig. 4C, lanes 6–8) and control IgG (Fig. 4C, lane 9) failed to inhibit the supershift (Fig. 4B). CBF/NF-Y Binds to the COL11A1 Proximal Promoter both in Vitro and in Vivo—To examine whether CBF/NF-Y binds directly to the COL11A1 proximal promoter, we performed two in vitro and in vivo binding experiments. For the in vitro binding analysis, four tandem copies of the –147 to –121 GS4 oligonucleotide were generated and immobilized on latex beads. These were then used for the purification of binding proteins from A204 cell nuclear extracts, and the purified protein was subsequently used in EMSA analyses. As shown in Fig. 5, the 32P-labeled GS4 probe bound to the affinity-purified proteins (lane 4) at levels similar to those of the crude extracts (lane 1), and the bands were supershifted by anti-CBF-A/NF-YB (lane 6), CBF-B/NF-YA (lane 7), and CBF-C/NF-YC (lane 8) antibodies. Furthermore, the affinity-purified proteins strongly bound to the CBF/NF-Y consensus oligonucleotides (lane 9) and were clearly supershifted by anti-CBF/NF-Y antibodies (lanes 10–12). Next, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis to examine whether CBF/NF-Y binds to the COL11A1 proximal promoter in vivo. Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies, the cross-links reversed, and the recovered DNA fragments were monitored by PCR using primers for the –291 to +1 region of the COL11A1 promoter. DNA fragments immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against CBF/NF-Y could be amplified by PCR using the indicated primers (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6) as well as the positive control (lane 2), whereas those immunoprecipitated with normal goat IgG (lane 4) or without antibody (lane 3) could not. These results indicate that CBF/NF-Y binds directly to the ATTGG region in the COL11A1 proximal promoter.Fig. 6CBF/NF-Y binds the ATTGG region in the COL11A1 proximal promoter, in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed to monitor the binding of CBF/NF-Y to the COL11A1 proximal promoter, in vivo. Protein-DNA complexes were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against CBF-A/NF-YB, CBF-B/NF-YA, and CBF-C/NF-YC, and isolated by immunoprecipitation (lanes 5 and 6). Positive control was prepared before immunoprecipitation (lane 2) and negative controls were isolated by immunoprecipitation with normal goat IgG (lane 4) or without antibody (lane 3), respectively. All immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were analyzed by PCR with the indicated primers, and a 100-bp ladder was used as a molecular weight marker (lane 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2046916214,"At present, there is very limited knowledge about the structural organization of the yeast oligosaccharyl transferase (OT) complex and the function of each of its nine subunits. Because of the failure of the yeast two-hybrid system to reveal interactions between luminal domains of these subunits, we utilized a membrane permeable, thiocleavable cross-linking reagent dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate to biochemically study the interactions of various OT subunits. Four essential gene products, Ost1p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, and Stt3p were shown to be cross-linked to each other in a pairwise fashion. In addition, Ost1p was found to be cross-linked to all other eight OT subunits individually. This led us to propose that Ost1p may reside in the core of the OT complex and could play an important role in its assembly. Ost4p and Ost5p were found to only interact with specific components of the OT complex and may function as an additional anchor for optimal stability of Stt3p and Ost1p in the membrane, respectively. Interestingly, Ost3p and Ost6p subunits exhibited a surprisingly identical pattern of cross-linking to other subunits, which is consistent with their proposed redundant function. Based on these findings, we analyzed the distribution of the lysine residues that are likely to be involved in cross-linking of OT subunits and propose that the OT subunits interact with each other through either their transmembrane domains and/or a region proximal to it, rather than through their luminal or cytoplasmic domains.

Over the past decade it has been established that in both higher eukaryotes and yeast, the enzyme oligosaccharyl transferase (OT), 1The abbreviations used are: OT, oligosaccharyl transferase; DSP, dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate; HA, hemagglutinin; Dol, dolichol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum, PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; LLOS, lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthase.1The abbreviations used are: OT, oligosaccharyl transferase; DSP, dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate; HA, hemagglutinin; Dol, dolichol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum, PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; LLOS, lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthase. is a complex consisting of multiple, nonidentical membrane protein subunits residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the case of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nine different subunits have been cloned and identified. Among them, the genes encoding Ost1p, Ost2p, Stt3p, Wbp1p, and Swplp are essential for the viability of the cell; OST4 gene is essential for growth of the cell at 37 °C, but not at 25 °C; Ost3p, Ost5p, Ost6p subunits are not essential for the viability of the cell, but are required for maximal activity of the enzyme complex in catalyzing N-glycosylation (for review, see Refs. 1Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and 2Dempski Jr., R.E. Imperiali B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 844-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To understand how these nine subunits interact with each other, a genetic approach using the yeast two-hybrid screen was utilized, but it failed to show interactions between any of the luminal domains of the yeast OT subunits (3Park H. Lennarz W.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Studies on the mechanism of enzyme catalysis have proposed that Wbp1p may contain a site for the binding of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide substrate (4Pathak R. Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4179-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and Stt3p was shown to be directly involved in peptide substrate recognition and/or the catalytic glycosylation process (5Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47692-47700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, there is little detailed information on how these two subunits interact to catalyze the glycosylation reaction. Study of the structural interactions of membrane proteins of the ER offers a special challenge because of the hydrophobicity of the proteins and the special environment in which these proteins reside: the hydrophobic bilayer and the aqueous environment both outside of the ER membrane and within its lumen. X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are traditional means to elucidate the structural organization of proteins; however, both techniques require relatively large amounts of pure proteins, and NMR is only useful with low-molecular-weight proteins; therefore these methods have limitations with respect to membrane complexes (6Back W.J. Sanz M.A. De Jong L. De Koning L.J. Nijtmans L.G.J. De Koster C.G. Grivell L.A. Van Der Spek H. Muijsers A.O. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2471-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Structural genomics and protein modeling are also limited in the case of the OT complex because of the lack of an extensive data base of known folds or structures of membrane proteins existing in part in the ER membrane and also in the aqueous environment of either the cytoplasm or the ER lumen. As an alternative approach to study the structural organizations of the OT subunits, we carried out chemical cross-linking experiments using a molecule that contains homo bifunctional amino-reactive groups with a 12 Å hydrophobic spacer arm between them to examine interactions between the potential domains of OT subunits. We took advantage of the membrane permeability and thiocleavability of the cross-linking reagent dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate (DSP) and prepared a collection of 20 yeast strains in which different OT subunits were HA- or Myc-tagged to study the inter-relationship of OT subunits. Based on examination of the interactions between any two subunits of OT, a comprehensive view of the inter-relationship of these proteins was developed. To further explore which segments are involved in the interactions of OT subunits, we investigated the distribution of lysine residues in the nine subunits of OT by which a covalent linkage between two proteins could occur and found that although different OT subunits display different distributions of lysine residues across their peptide backbones, all of them have lysine residues, which are located at the interface of the hydrophilic and transmembrane segments. This finding leads to our speculation that probably these lysine residues located in the peripheral segments of transmembrane domains contribute to the cross-linking reaction. We then tested this idea by monitoring the cross-linking of OT subunits with two other enzymes, Alg1p and Pdi1p, which are not included in the OT complex but act in assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide substrate, and protein folding disulfide bond formation of nascent proteins, respectively (7Albright C.F. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7042-7049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Luz J.M. Lennarz W.J. EXS. 1996; 77: 97-117PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that Alg1p, an ER membrane-associated enzyme, was cross-linked to Ost1p, whereas the ER luminal enzyme, Pdi1p was not cross-linked to any of the OT subunits. Taking these results together, we concluded that the interactions among OT subunits occur through transmembrane domains and/or the region proximal to it, rather than their luminal or cytoplasmic domains. Materials—The cross-linking reagent DSP was purchased from Pierce. Antibodies to HA and Myc epitopes were purchased from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein G-agarose beads were supplied by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Procedures—Yeast microsomes were prepared as described (9Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J.

Lithium acetate transformation was utilized for all yeast transformations in this study; standard yeast media and genetic techniques were used (10Elble R.

Strains—The yeast wild type strain W303-1a (MATa ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) was used as the origin strain to generate QYY102 (W303-1a OST2::HA-his5 + S. pombe), QYY104 (W303-1a SWP::HA-his5 + S. pombe), QYY105 (W303-1a OST5::HA-his5 + S. pombe), AYY7 (W303-1a OST6::HA-his5 + S. pombe), and AYY10 (W303-1a OST4:: myc-KanR ).

Open table in a new tab Construction of Plasmids and Strains—QYY102 (W303-1a OST2:: HA-his5 + S. pombe), QYY104 (W303-1a SWP::HA-his5 + S. pombe), QYY105 (W303-1a OST5::HA-his5 + S. pombe) were prepared using ME-3 plasmid and the same method as mentioned earlier (5Yan Q.

AYY7 (W3031-a OST6::3HA-his5 + S. pombe) and AYY10 (W303-1a OST4:: 13myc::KanR ) were prepared as follows: A 1019-bp DNA fragment encoding the OST6 gene was obtained by PCR amplification using genomic DNA of yeast as the template (primers were: 5′-GCTAGCAGCTGATGAAGTGGTGTAGCACATAC-3′ and 5′-GCTAGGGATCCCAAAAACAATTGGGTACCCTGG-3′). This fragment was then ligated into the PvuII/BamHI-digested plasmid pFA6a-3HA-His3MX6 (14Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shh N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar) followed by subcloning of a 300-base pair DNA fragment encoding the downstream region of the OST6 gene into the SacI/SacII sites to generate the plasmid, pFA6a-OST6–3HA-His3-300 bp downstream of OST6MX6. Using this plasmid as the template, the PCR product, which consisted of the OST6 gene followed by 3 HA epitope repeats, the HIS3 gene, and the 300 base pairs downstream of the OST6 gene, was transformed into the W303-1a strain, resulted in the strain AYY7 (W303-1a OST6::HAhis5 + S. pombe). The colonies were selected on -His plates, and the integration was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the expression of epitope-tagged protein was confirmed by SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis. The same procedure was utilized to generate AYY10 (W303-a OST4::13myc-KanR) except HindIII/SalI sites were used to replace PvuII/BamH I sites and plasmid pFA6a-13myc-KanMX6 was used to replace plasmid pFA6a-3HA-His3MX6. The colonies were consequently selected on YPAD + G418 plate. QYY102, QYY105, AYY7, RGY330, and AYY10 were used as recipient strains for preparing the constructs that contain two chromosomal epitope tags in a single strain (Table I) using the same strategy as described above. All the constructs made in this study were confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the expression of proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using suitable antibodies. The integration of OT complex in these strains was checked by co-immunoprecipitation followed by SDS/PAGE and then Western blot analysis using available antibodies (anti-HA, anti-Myc, and antibodies to Ost1p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, and Stt3p). The Co-immunoprecipitation Procedure Using Mild Detergent—This procedure was modified from Karaoglu et al. (15Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem.,. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Yeast microsomes were collected by centrifugation, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 5% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 1mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration of protein, 10 mg/ml). The microsomal suspention was then adjusted to contain 1.5% digitonin, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2. The mixture was centrifuged for 20 min at 55,000 revolutions/minute, and the clarified supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitation conditions were described earlier (15Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem.,. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved on SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then probed with the indicated antibodies. The Conditions for Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation Using Harsh Detergent—Microsomes were collected as mentioned above, and the membrane pellet (final concentration of protein, 10 mg/ml) was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated on ice for 0.5 h. The cross-linking reagent DSP, which was dissolved in Me2SO, was then added to the suspension to a final concentration of 2 mm; the final concentration of Me2SO was 1% (For control analysis, the same amount of Me2SO alone was added). The cross-linking reaction was carried out at room temperature for 0.5 h followed by the addition of 5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl pH 7.4 to quench the reaction. The resulting membrane proteins were then solubilized with 1 ml of LB buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using mouse anti-HA antibody followed by affinity purification using protein G-agarose beads. After incubation with protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at room temperature, the immunocomplex was washed three times with 1 ml of LB buffer each time and once with 1 ml of TBS. SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm DTT was used to cleave the cross-linking reagent and elute the proteins from protein G-agarose beads. The protein samples were resolved by SDS/PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-Ost1p, -Wbp1p, -Swp1p, or -Stt3p antibodies. The Inter-relationship of Yeast OT Subunits Could Be Studied in a Pairwise Manner Using Cross-linking Reagent—As outlined in Fig. 1, when the microsomes prepared from a series of yeast strains (Table I) were treated with DSP, it was expected that two proteins would be covalently linked together if they contain lysine residues located within 12 Å of each other. To identify the cross-linked proteins, the complex was solubilized using a harsh detergent treatment to disrupt the physical interactions between proteins while still maintaining the previously generated disulfide covalent linkage. Since one of the OT subunits was HA-tagged, its covalent binding partner would be co-precipitated in the subsequent immunoprecipitation procedure using monoclonal HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, in addition to the cross-linked protein with the epitope-tagged protein, obviously, another pair of proteins could also be covalently coupled provided their lysine residues are located within 12 Å. However, they could not be recovered in the immunoprecipitation procedure because of the absence of the epitope tag. After further purification of the co-precipitated complex by immobilizing it on protein G-agarose beads followed by washing, elution, and finally cleaving the disulfide bond, the bound partner could be identified if it reacted to one of the OT subunit antibodies. For those potential binding partners whose antibodies were not available (Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, and Ost6p), we attached two different epitope tags (HA and Myc) to two different subunits in a single strain so that the cross-linked partner could be identified by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1). Thus, the inter-relationship of any two OT subunits could be studied by using different combinations of strains. Based on this pairwise study, a comprehensive view on the inter-relationship of yeast OT subunits could be developed. To obtain the original expression level of the proteins, the chromosomal copy of the corresponding genes were epitope-tagged. The growth rates of these generated strains were the same as the wild-type strain, which indicated that the epitope tags did not disrupt OT complex formation (data not shown). Four Essential Gene Products, namely Ost1p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, and Stt3p Were Found to Be Cross-linked to Each Other—As shown in Fig. 2A, the microsomes of the strains that had Wbp1p, Swp1p, and Stt3p HA epitope-tagged were treated with DSP followed by immunoprecipitation using mouse anti-HA antibody under harsh detergent solubilization conditions. After cleaving the disulfide bond, Western blot analysis revealed that Ost1p had been cross-linked to and then co-precipitated with Wbp1p, Swp1p, and Stt3p, respectively (lanes 3, 6, and 9). In contrast, in the absence of the cross-linking reagent (lanes 2, 5, and 8), no co-precipitation of Ost1p was observed. As expected, immunoblots of the samples that were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation under gentle, non-denaturing conditions (lanes 1, 4, and 7) also showed the corresponding co-precipitation of Ost1p indicating that these three OT subunits individually remained associated with Ost1p under non-denaturing conditions. We further examined these biochemical interactions reversibly by utilizing the strain that had Ost1p HA-tagged to undertake the same experimental procedures and immunoblotting with anti-Wbp1p, Stt3p, and Swp1p antibody. Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 2 confirmed the biochemical interactions between Ost1p with Wbp1p, Swp1p, or Stt3p (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 2, and 3; Fig. 2C, lanes 1, 2, and 3 and Fig. 2D, lanes 4, 5, and 6). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 2, B–D, pairwise biochemical interactions between any of the two proteins among these four essential gene products were demonstrated. However, using the same approach, another essential gene product Ost2p, was found to be cross-linked to Ost1p, Wbp1p, and Stt3p, but not to Swp1p (Fig. 2E), indicating Ost2p and Swp1p are not in close proximity to each other although both are located close to Ost1p, Wbp1p, and Stt3p. We noted that in all cases the bands of expected proteins were more intense under non-denaturing conditions without cross-linking than the corresponding ones after cross-linking followed by harsh detergent treatment. This finding was not unlikely because the chemical cross-linker would not completely couple all the pairs of proteins in a half-hour incubation. Ost1p Directly Interacts with All Other Eight Subunits— A variety of epitope-tagged strains, OST2HA, OST3HA, OST4myc, OST5HA, OST6HA, STT3HA, WBP1HA, and SWP1HA, were used in this cross-linking study. As shown in Fig. 3, Western blot analysis using anti-Ost1p antibody revealed that Ost1p could directly interact with all other eight subunits of OT. Ost1p was the only OT subunit that could be cross-linked to all of the other eight subunits. Since previous studies using techniques of non-denaturing immunoprecipitation and 35S labeling (15Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem.,. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), as well as the result of blue native electrophoresis (16Knauer R. Lehle L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17249-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), revealed that the yeast OT is composed of nine subunits in approximately equimolar amounts, our result led us to propose that Ost1p may reside in the core of the OT complex probably playing an important role in its assembly. This proposal may explain the observations in a number of earlier studies that different subunit compositions of the OT complexes have been proposed using different purification procedures, but in all cases Ost1p was always shown to be one of the components of the complex by different groups (16Knauer R. Lehle L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17249-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Knauer R. Lehle L.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Ost4p and Ost5p Are Found Only to Interact with Specific Components of OT Complex—Ost4p and Ost5p are two small, hydrophobic, non-essential gene products in the OT complex. As shown in Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 8, Ost4p and Ost5p were found to be in close proximity with Ost1p. However, unlike some of the essential gene products in the OT complex, which contain long luminal tails (Wbp1p, Stt3p, and Swp1p) and were found could be cross-linked to Ost1p (see above), Ost4p and Ost5p contain short luminal tails with most of their peptide backbones residing within the ER membrane. Since it was demonstrated that the active site of OT is 30–40 Å away from the ER membrane in the ER lumen (21Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that the close contact between Ost1p with Ost4p and Ost5p may not contribute to the catalytic mechanism of OT; instead, these interactions may indicate their roles on assembly of the complex. Indeed, in contrast to the interaction pattern of the essential gene products that interact with each other as mentioned above, Ost4p and Ost5p are found only to interact with specific components of those essential gene products (Table II). The exact function of these small, hydrophobic proteins is not clear. However, taking together our cross-linking study and the results of a genetic screen on OST5 gene (22Reiss G. te Heesen S. Gilmore R. Zufferey R. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as well as a biochemical study on Ost4p, which demonstrates that Ost4p specifically functions to stabilize the subcomplex of Stt3p-Ost4p-Ost3p (23Kim H. Yan Q. Heijne G. Caputo G. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7460-7464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we suggest that Ost4p and Ost5p may function as additional anchors in the membrane required for optimal stability of the essential gene products, Stt3p and Ost1p, respectively. Despite their common accessory role, Ost4p displays multiple interactions with other OT subunits compared with Ost5p (Table II). This finding may fulfill the genetic observation that deletion of the OST4 gene renders the inviability of the cell at 37 °C (24Chi J.H. Roos J. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) whereas the OST5 gene is not essential for the viability of the yeast cell, and its depletion only results in a reduction of OT activity to about half of wild-type levels (22Reiss G. te Heesen S. Gilmore R. Zufferey R. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Table IISummary of interactions observed among OT subunitsOSt1pOst2pOst3pOst4pOst5pOst6pStt3pWbp1pSwp1pOst1p+a+, detected interactions with DSP.+++++++Ost2p++-b-, not detected interactions with DSP.-+++-Ost3p+-+-+++-Ost4p+++-++--Ost5p+-----+-Ost6p+-++-++-Stt3p++++-+++Wbp1p+++-++++Swp1p+-----++a +, detected interactions with DSP.b -, not detected interactions with DSP. Open table in a new tab Ost3p and Ost6p Showed an Identical Pattern of Cross-linking with Other OT Subunits—Based on the overall cross-linking study of pairs of OT subunits, a comprehensive view on their inter-relationships is summarized in Table II. To our surprise, Ost3p and Ost6p showed an identical pattern of cross-linking to other subunits. Interestingly, these two proteins could not be co-immunoprecipitated by each other under gentle, non-denaturing detergent conditions (1.5% digitonin) (Fig. 4, lane 1), but they could be cross-linked to each other by DSP (Fig. 4, lane 3), indicating that they do not exist in the same complex but nevertheless they are close to each other. Furthermore, the surprising similarity of their interaction pattern with other OT subunits in this study implied that they may have some similar or redundant functions in the cell. This proposal is consistent with a genetic study that revealed that the single null mutant of either ost3 or ost6 exhibits a low level of underglycosylation whereas the double mutants of ost3 and ost6 shows severe underglycosylation, as well as a biophysical analysis, which demonstrated that these two proteins are strikingly similar with respect to their hydropath plot (16Knauer R. Lehle L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17249-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). OT Subunits Are Not Equal Concerning Their Ability to Remain Associated with Other OT Complex Components under Non-denaturing Immunoprecipitation Conditions—We tested all of the nine yeast OT subunits for their ability to co-immunoprecipitate the other OT subunits under gentle, non-denaturing detergent conditions without cross-linking. We found that HA-tagged Ost5p did not remain associated with Swp1p in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment using mouse HA antibody (Fig. 5A, lane 10). Moreover, Ost2p did not remain associated with Stt3p, Ost4p, and Ost6p under the same conditions (Fig. 5B, lanes 1, 4, and 7). These observations indicated that by using this technique, no direct physical interactions can be detected between the pairs of OT subunits mentioned above, namely, Ost5p and Swp1p, Ost2p, and Stt3p, Ost4p, Ost6p, respectively. Among them, the physical interaction between Ost2p and Ost6p as well as between Ost2p and Stt3p was not observed under non-denaturing detergent conditions for co-immunoprecipitation. However, each pair was shown to be cross-linked together by DSP (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 6), which indicated that these two pairs of proteins are within 12 Å to each other, whereas the physical contact between their polypeptide chains, if any, is insufficient to result in co-immunoprecipitation. In the case of Ost5p and Swp1p, and of Ost2p and Ost4p, our results revealed that they are neither in close proximity nor do they physically interact.

https://openalex.org/W2103891110,"Functional studies of cellular proteins are often complicated by the lack of well-defined monoclonal antibodies, the production of which is hampered by the highly conserved nature of these cellular proteins across species. Annexin XI, a member of the Ca2+-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein family, is an example of such a protein and was used in studies to devise a strategy using human autoimmune phage display libraries to generate reagents for biological studies of conserved cellular proteins. An IgG phage display library was generated from bone marrow of an autoimmune patient with high serum antibody titer against annexin XI, which was identified recently as an autoantigen targeted by autoantibodies in several systemic autoimmune diseases. From this phage library, a panel of human monoclonal annexin XI-specific Fabs were isolated and applied to studies of the cellular functions of annexin XI. Confocal microscopy showed a cell cycle-specific redistribution of annexin XI from the cytoplasm to the mitotic spindle. In metaphase, annexin XI was up-regulated and costained with α-tubulin. The subcellular distribution of annexin XI in COS-7 cells was shown to be Ca2+-dependent, and exhibited a predominantly nuclear pattern at low concentrations and a cytoplasmic pattern at high Ca2+ concentrations. Calcyclin, found previously to bind annexin XI in vitro, in vivo coated the nuclear membrane of cultured cell lines and did not colocalize with annexin XI. Ultrastructural analysis by immunoelectron microscopy revealed that annexin XI associated with specific granules in both neutrophils and eosinophils, suggesting a role in the exocytotic pathway. Our results illuminate the multifunctional nature of human annexin XI, provide the first evidence that annexin XI associates with the mitotic spindles and might play a role in cell division, and clearly illustrate the potential of phage display-derived human autoantibodies in broader analyses of the function of highly conserved cellular proteins.

Annexin XI is a member of the annexin superfamily, which is characterized by Ca2+-dependent binding to negatively charged phospholipids, e.g. as found in biomembranes (1Creutz C.E. Pazoles C.J. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3798-3802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blackwood R.A. Ernst J.D. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). All annexin proteins consist of a conserved C-terminal annexin homology domain containing either 4 or 8 repeating units of 70 amino acids and an individually unique N-terminal regulatory domain. The N-terminal of annexin XI is hydrophobic, rich in glycine, tyrosine, and proline residues, and is larger than that of the other annexin members. Annexin XI is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types of eukaryotes, but its subcellular distribution varies considerably. Some growth and differentiation conditions favor the presence of annexin XI in the nucleus, whereas others favor either a cytoplasmic distribution or both. Annexin XI has been found localized predominantly in the nucleus of rapidly developing tissue, such as undifferentiated mesenchymal cells of 14-day-old rat embryos (5Mamiya N. Iino S. Mizutani A. Kobayashi S. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, once this tissue differentiated into connective tissue, as in the 18-day-old embryo, annexin XI was found equally distributed in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The N-terminal domain of annexin XI has been proposed to contain a nuclear localization signal, because deletion of the N-terminal domain shifted the distribution of annexin XI from nuclear to cytoplasmic within COS-7 cells, although no traditional nuclear localization signal has been identified (6Mizutani A. Watanabe N. Kitao T. Tokumitsu H. Hidaka H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal domain also contains a binding site for calcyclin, a Ca2+-binding and growth cycle-regulated EF hand protein (7Sudo T. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Annexin XI also seems to play a role in the secretion or degranulation of neutrophil granules, suggested by its binding to granules in a Ca2+-dependent manner (8Sjölin C. Dahlgren C. Blood. 1996; 87: 4817-4823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sjölin C. Movitz C. Lundqvist H. Dahlgren C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Supporting this concept, annexin XI has been shown to be secreted by activated neutrophils in response to an internal calcium signal (10Boussac M. Garin J. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Annexin XI has also been found in insulin-containing granules and suggested to play a role in insulin release (11Iino S. Sudo T. Niwa T. Fukasawa T. Hidaka H. Niki I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that annexin XI is involved in vesicle formation, because transfection of insect Sf9 cells with recombinant annexin XI-A caused the formation of large “annexin XI-associated vesicles” in the cytoplasm of the cells that were clearly visible with a light microscope (12Sudo T. Mamiya N. Goto M. Watanabe Y. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Autoantibodies to many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are found in the sera of patients with diverse autoimmune conditions (13Tan E.M. Chan E.K. Sullivan K.F. Rubin R.L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1988; 47: 121-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 14Nepartstek Y. Plotz P.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 79-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Antibodies to a particular autoantigen are often associated with a specific autoimmune disease or a disease process that is common to a group of autoimmune diseases. Recently, annexin XI was identified as an autoantigen in ∼10% of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren's syndrome (15Misaki Y. Pruijn G.J.M. van der Kemp A.W.C.M. van Venrooij W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4240-4246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Misaki Y. Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 22: 97-102PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-annexin XI response is predominantly of the IgG subclass and targeted against the unique N-terminal domain of the protein, demonstrated by lack of cross-reactivity with other annexins and with recombinant C-terminal-truncated annexin XI in immunoprecipitation studies (15Misaki Y. Pruijn G.J.M. van der Kemp A.W.C.M. van Venrooij W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4240-4246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that anti-annexin XI antibodies might have relevance for thrombosis because of some degree of co-occurrence (17Jorgensen C.S. Levantino G. Houen G. Jacobsen S. Halberg P. Ullman S. Khamashta M.A. Asmussen K. Oxholm P. Jorgensen M.K. van Venrooij W.J. Wiik A. Lupus. 2000; 9: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To explain the mechanism behind the association with thrombosis, it has been hypothesized that if annexin XI, similar to annexin V, has anticoagulant properties, anti-annexin XI autoantibodies may inhibit this regulatory function (17Jorgensen C.S. Levantino G. Houen G. Jacobsen S. Halberg P. Ullman S. Khamashta M.A. Asmussen K. Oxholm P. Jorgensen M.K. van Venrooij W.J. Wiik A. Lupus. 2000; 9: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although more data on annexin XI are becoming available, its cellular function remains to be clarified. One limiting factor is the lack of annexin XI-specific monoclonal antibodies, which are difficult to generate because of their conserved structure in different species. Because autoantibodies against annexin XI are found in patients with different autoimmune diseases, we decided to clone a panel of annexin XI-specific antibodies by phage display technology and use them as probes to examine the subcellular localization of annexin XI in various human cells using confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Our results show for the first time that annexin XI is up-regulated in mitotic cells and stains mitotic spindles. Ca2+ was found to influence both the association of annexin XI with tubulin and the nuclear or cytoplasmic subcellular localization of annexin XI. Phage display cloned human autoantibodies provide valuable tools for the biological study of conserved cellular proteins. Library Construction and Phage Selection—Preparation of RNA from bone marrow lymphocytes and subsequent construction of an IgG1 κ/λ Fab library using the pComb3 M13 surface display system have been described (18Barbas III, C.F.

For antibody selection, the phage library generated from a rheumatoid arthritis patient was panned separately against freshly isolated neutrophils in suspension and recombinant annexin XI coated on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 1The abbreviations used are: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FR, framework region; CDR, complementarity-determining region. wells. Neutrophils were prepared from fresh heparinized whole blood by a combination of dextran sedimentation and centrifugation through discontinuous plasma-Percoll gradients as described (20Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). This technique was designed to minimize exposure to bacterial endotoxin and preserve the neutrophils in a minimally activated state. Subsequently, the neutrophil pellet was washed twice with 0.9% saline and resuspended to ∼5 × 107 cells/ml. Fab displaying phage resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) were added to the microtube containing neutrophils and to recombinant annexin XI coated onto ELISA wells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C or 37 °C, respectively. Unbound phage were removed by washing 10 times with PBS containing 1% BSA. Bound phage, enriched for those bearing antigen-binding surface Fabs, were eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.2. The eluted phage were amplified by infection of Escherichia coli and superinfection with M13 helper phage. The panning procedure was repeated four times, after which phagemid DNA was prepared from the last round, and the gene III fragment was removed by treatment with NheI and SpeI enzymes, followed by religation. The reconstructed phagemid was used to transform XL1-Blue cells to produce clones secreting soluble Fab fragments. Fabs were purified from bacterial supernatants by affinity chromatography, as described previously, with minor modifications (19Burton D.R. Barbas III, C.F. Persson M.A.A. Koenig S. Chanock R.M.

Cloning of Annexin XI—RNA was isolated from HeLa cells and reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and the gene encoding annexin XI was amplified using specific primers. The PCR product was cloned into the pCEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia) using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. The ligated vector was heat pulse-transformed into BL21 E. coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A single clone, containing the correct insert as determined by sequencing, was grown in Luria-Bertani media, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. ELISA Analysis—To assess specificity, Fabs were screened by ELISA against recombinant annexin XI and a panel of other antigens including annexin V, ovalbumin, BSA, the Fc part of IgG (all from Sigma), tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO), HIV-1 gp120 (Intracel, Issaquah, WA), whole recombinant human annexin VII (kindly provided by Dr. H. B. Pollard, Uniformed Services University School of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), and the N-terminal region of annexin VII and the N-terminal region of annexin XI expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (the plasmids pGST-Anx7N and pGST-Anx11N were kindly provided by Dr. M. Maki, Nagoya University, Japan (22Satoh H. Nakano Y. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). As negative controls, a human anti-HIV-1 gp120 Fab, b12, and an anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) were included. Human Fabs were incubated with the test antigen for 1.5 h at 37 °C, followed by washing with PBS-0.05% Tween. Detection of bound human Fabs was carried out with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)2 antibody (Pierce) and visualized with nitrophenol substrate (NPP substrate) (Sigma) by reading absorbance at 405 nm. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Electrophoresis of HeLa nuclear and cytoplasmic extract (Computer Cell Culture Center, Mons, Belgium), resolved under denaturing and reducing (100 mm dithiothreitol) conditions, was performed in a discontinuous buffer system on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked for 2 h in 5% skimmed milk in 10 mm Tris, 350 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, washed three times with Western blot buffer (50 mm Tris, 350 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaN3, and 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with patient sera diluted in 1:50, 1:100, and 1:200 in incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% skimmed milk, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) or control antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed in Western blot buffer and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG antibody (diluted 1:500, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the membrane was fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and finally washed in PBS. Bound alkaline phosphatase conjugate was visualized by nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad). A low range protein marker (Bio-Rad) was used to indicate the molecular weight of the fragments. Immunocytochemical Analysis by Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Mammalian cell lines HEp-2, HeLa (human squamous carcinoma), and A549 (human lung cancer) were grown in RPMI 1640-supplemented 10% fetal calf serum (Tissue Culture Biologists), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin, whereas COS-7 (Green Monkey kidney), MCF-7, MB157, BrCaMZ01 (human breast carcinoma), RD (human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma), and U87 (human glioblastoma) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% l-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were allowed to adhere to coverslips (Nunc, Kamstrup, Denmark) for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, to form monolayers. In some experiments, the cells were washed in either 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA (Sigma) and incubated with 0.005% Triton X-100 in either 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA for 2 s before fixation in ice-cold ethanol. In other experiments, HEp-2 cells were treated with either 10 μm nocodazole for 2–10 h, 10 μm colchicine for 2 h, or 10 μm cytochalasin D for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Neutrophils were purified as described above and stained in suspension. Glass slides with HEp-2 cells attached (ANA-screen, Immuno Concepts, Sacramento, CA) were also used. Cells were fixed with ice-cold ethanol for 5 min, followed by four washes with PBS and blocking with 5% normal goat serum (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) for 30 min. Cells were incubated with the following antibodies: purified human anti-annexin Fabs (2–10 μg/ml), donor serum (1:640), rabbit anti-human calcyclin antibody (1:400, Sigma), and mouse anti-human α-tubulin antibody (1:100, Sigma) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The cells were washed five times for 3 min each time with PBS and incubated with FITC-labeled (Fab′)2 goat anti-human IgG (Fab′)2 antibody, Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, or CY-5-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (all from Jackson). When appropriate, the cells were also incubated with propidium iodine (5 μg/ml, Sigma) in the final step at 5 μg/ml for 10 min. The slides were mounted with Slow Fade™ in PBS/glycerol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) before analysis using a ZEISS Axiovert S100 TV confocal microscope. As controls, all experiments were carried out omitting the primary antibody. Labeling of Fabs with Fluorescein Isothiocyanate and Nanogold— Conjugation with fluorescein isothiocyanate and Nanogold was performed using kits from Roche Diagnostics Corp. (Indianapolis, IN) and Nanoprobe (Stony Brook, NY), respectively, according to the manufactures' guidelines. In brief, human Fab (100 μg) was mixed with 9.5 μlof Flous solution (2 mg/ml in Me2SO) and allowed to incubate for 2 h at room temperature on a Lab-quake shaker. The mixture was then added to a G-25 Sephadex gel filtration column (Pharmacia) to separate the Fab from the unreacted reagents. The Fab was eluted in four 1-ml fractions and concentrated. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody (300 μl) was mixed with 220 μl of Nanogold reagent (first dissolved in 20 μl of Me2SO, then 200 μl of deionized H2O). The reagents were incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a Lab-quake shaker. Again, labeled Fab was separated from the unreacted reagents by gel filtration. The final concentration of the labeled Fab was estimated using an anti-Fab ELISA. Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, then in 0.5 mg/ml sodium borohydride, and finally again in PBS before being permeabilized in 0.005% saponin for 10 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS and blocking with 5% normal goat serum and 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-Nanogold-labeled AN5-17 in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, the cells were postfixed for 10 min in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, washed in PBS and subsequently in 0.02 m sodium citrate buffer. Silver enhancement was performed in the dark using a HQ Silver Enhancement kit (Nanoprobes). The cells were washed in 0.02 m sodium citrate, postfixed in 1% OsO4 in d2H2O for 15 min, dehydrated in graded ethanols, incubated with propylene oxide for 30 min, and after removal of the propylene oxide, embedded in Epon/Araldite. Ultrathin sections were viewed in a Philips CM100 EM electron microscope. Cloning of Human Anti-Annexin XI Antibodies—The need to understand the cellular function of the Ca2+-binding protein annexin XI led us to clone human IgG anti-annexin XI antibodies using phage display. Initially, a panel of sera from patients with systemic autoimmune disease were examined for anti-annexin XI reactivity by Western blotting. Serum from one patient with rheumatoid arthritis contained IgG antibodies that bound to a band with a molecular mass of 56 kDa in the cytoplasmic fraction of HeLa cells, indicative of annexin XI. The IgG anti-annexin XI reactivity of the serum was confirmed by its binding to recombinant annexin XI in ELISA. This patient's serum also exhibited an uncharacteristic staining pattern of the squamous cell line HEp-2, a cell line commonly used for anti-nuclear antibody identification in the clinic. The serum also stained neutrophils, but not lymphocytes, using immunofluorescence microscopy. To clone a panel of human anti-annexin XI autoantibodies, an IgG/κ/λ phage display library of ∼6 × 106 members was constructed from the bone marrow RNA of the rheumatoid arthritis patient. The antibody library was selected against freshly isolated neutrophils in suspension and against recombinant annexin XI coated on ELISA wells. After four rounds of biopanning, a 20- and 80-fold amplification in eluted phage was observed in the two selection protocols, respectively, indicating enrichment for antigen-binding Fabphages. Individual clones, expressed as soluble Fabs by excising the gene III from the pcomb3 phagemid DNA from the last round of selection, were tested for binding to recombinant annexin XI by ELISA. This analysis yielded 12 Fabs, which exhibited strong binding to annexin XI and no binding to BSA. Sequencing of the DNA encoding the heavy chain variable region of the 12 Fabs revealed that four Fabs, AN4–16, AN5–14, AN5–17, and AN5–20, were unique, whereas the remaining sequences were repeats of the four sequences (Fig. 1). Next, the specificity of the four Fabs was further examined by ELISA using a panel of control antigens, including annexin V, annexin VII, N-terminal region of annexin VII, tubulin, HIV-1 gpl20, ovalbumin, BSA, and the Fc part of IgG. As shown in Fig. 2, all four Fabs bound strongly to recombinant annexin XI, but not to annexin V, despite annexin V and XI having highly homologous C-terminal cores. The Fabs did not bind to whole human annexin VII or the N-terminal region of annexin VII, despite exhibiting the closest homology with annexin XI among all annexins (largest and most hydrophobic N-terminal tails), and also did not bind to the other control antigens, thus demonstrating that they were specifically directed against the N-terminal tail of annexin XI. An anti-HIV-1 gpl20 Fab, b12 used as a control, did not bind to the recombinant annexin XI, but bound strongly to HIV-1 gp120. Immunofluorescence analysis and laser scanning confocal microscopy of HEp-2 cells demonstrated that all four anti-annexin Fabs examined as bacterial supernatants exhibited a cytoplasmic staining pattern similar to the serum of the patient from whom the Fabs were cloned. The anti-annexin Fabs also bound to dot blots of HEp-2 cell lysates but not to Western blots of the same HEp-2 cell lysates, indicating that the Fabs recognized a conformational epitope on annexin XI that was sensitive to the SDS treatment.Fig. 2Human monoclonal IgG antibody Fab fragments bind specifically to annexin XI. To evaluate specificity, the Fabs were tested for binding to annexin XI, annexin V, annexin VII, tubulin, ovalbumin, BSA, HIV-1 gp120, and the Fc part of IgG. The human anti-HIV-1 gp120 Fab b12 was included as control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Probing the Subcellular Distribution of Annexin XI Using Recombinant Fabs—To detail the subcellular localization of annexin XI, a panel of human cell lines were examined with laser scanning confocal microscopy using one of the anti-annexin Fabs, AN5-17, as a probe. HEp-2 cells showed intense Fab AN5-17 staining in the cytoplasm and weak, speckled staining in the nucleus (Fig. 3). A similar cytoplasmic staining and weak speckle or no staining in the nucleus were observed in the other cells tested, including breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BrCaMZ01, lung cancer cell line A549, rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD, squamous carcinoma cell lines HEp-2 and HeLa, glioblastoma cell line U87, and Green Monkey kidney COS-7 cells (Figs. 3 and 5). As controls, the cells were also stained with an anti-HIV gp120 Fab b12 and an anti-DNA Fab SI-1. None of the control antibodies showed a staining pattern similar to Fab AN5-17.Fig. 5Subcellular distribution of annexin XI and calcyclin in different cell types and at different stages of the cell cycle were analyzed by human Fab AN5-17 and a mouse anti-calcyclin antibody as probes. Hep-2 (A–C) and COS-7 (D–F) cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with human Fab AN5–17 (A and D) and mouse anti-calcyclin (B and E). The images in column 3 are superimpositions of columns 1 and 2 showing Fab AN5-17 staining in green and anti-calcyclin antibody in blue. Calcyclin associated with the nuclear membrane in nondividing cells, whereas annexin XI was largely cytoplasmic and no costaining was observed. In mitotic cells (arrows), annexin XI staining was enhanced compared with resting cells and localized associated with mitotic microtubules as well as in the cytoplasm, whereas calcyclin staining gradually disappeared as the nuclear envelope disintegrated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The distribution of annexin XI throughout the cell cycle was also examined using Fab AN5-17, showing that annexin XI localized corresponding to the mitotic spindles in dividing HEp-2 cells (Fig. 3). An overlay image of cells costained with Fab AN5-17 and an anti-α-tubulin antibody demonstrated co-localization of the two proteins, implying that annexin XI associates with the tubulin-based spindle apparatus. Similar annexin XI staining of the spindle apparatus in mitotic A549 and COS-7 cells was observed (data not shown). Colocalization of annexin XI and α-tubulin in mitotic cells was not complete because annexin XI, in contrast to α-tubulin, was also found in the cytoplasm surrounding the spindle apparatus. Partial co-localization between annexin XI and α-tubulin was also observed in nondividing cells, although it was less distinct than in dividing cells (Fig. 3). The association of annexin XI with α-tubulin was studied in more detail by examining HEp-2 cells treated with nocodazole, colchicine, or cytochalasin D. Nocodazole and colchicine both inhibited formation of microtubule spindles, and no α-tubulin or annexin XI staining was observed at this location. Cytochalasin D treatment did not affect the annexin XI staining. When the nocodazole-arresting cells were released from the block, staining for α-tubulin and annexin XI was first observed in the perinuclear aster where the two antibodies colocalized. Subsequently, anti-annexin XI staining was present in spindle-like staining patterns of mitotic cells and even appeared to stain spindles in cells with hemispindles and multiple spindles (Fig. 3). These results confirm the immunofluorescent localization of annexin XI to the α-tubulin-containing mitotic spindle. Importantly, annexin XI staining in mitotic cells was much more intense than in nonmitotic cells, suggesting that annexin XI was up-regulated during cell division. This up-regulation in mitotic Hep-2 cells after release from nocodazole block was confirmed using Fab AN5-17 in ELISA (data not shown). In nondividing cells, a relatively constant amount of annexin XI from cell to cell was observed in most cell types, with the exception of rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells, wherein staining with Fab AN5-17 showed cells that were either intensely or weakly stained for annexin XI (data not shown). Ca2 + Influences the Subcellular Distribution of Annexin XI—In contrast to our finding by confocal microscopy, a previous report on annexin XI in COS-7 cells using conventional immunofluorescence microscopy described annexin XI as being located predominantly in the nucleu"
https://openalex.org/W2008308213,"STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-4) mediates biological effects in response to interleukin-12 (IL-12). STAT4 has multiple domains that have distinct functions in signaling and gene activation. To characterize the role of the STAT4 N-terminal domain in mediating STAT4 biological function, we have generated STAT4-deficient transgenic mice that express human full-length STAT4 or an N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN-STAT4) lacking the N-terminal 51 amino acids. Whereas full-length STAT4 rescued IL-12 responsiveness, T lymphocytes expressing the STAT4 N-terminal mutant failed to proliferate in response to IL-12 and had limited Th1 cell development as evidenced by minimal interferon-γ production. Deletion of the N-terminal domain resulted in failure of STAT4 to be phosphorylated following IL-12 stimulation despite similar phosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2 in full-length STAT4 and ΔN-STAT4 transgenic T cells. We demonstrate that the lack of phosphorylation in cultured cells is due to reduced efficiency of phosphorylation of ΔN-STAT4 by Janus kinases. These data support a new model wherein the N-terminal domain is required to mediate the phosphorylation of STAT4 in addition to the previously documented role in gene transactivation.

Interleukin (IL) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; JAK, Janus kinase; IL-12R, interleukin-12 receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; SH2, Src homology-2.-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine that is composed of p35 and p40 chains. It is predominantly secreted from antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. IL-12 initiates the differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th1 subsets, which are critical for cell-mediated immunity and immunity to bacteria, viruses, and intracellular parasites (1Trinchieri G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar). Interferon (IFN)-γ produced by Th1 cells enhances the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (1Trinchieri G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-12 promotes the proliferation of T cells in response to pathogenic stimulation. Thus, IL-12 is an important regulator in innate and adaptive immunity. IL-12 mediates its biological function by binding to IL-12 receptors (IL-12Rs) and transmitting signals via the JAK-STAT pathway. IL-12β1 and IL-12Rβ2 belong to the gp130 cytokine receptor superfamily. The IL-12Rs do not contain intrinsic kinase activity, but instead physically associate with members of the Janus family of protein-tyrosine kinases (JAKs); IL-12Rβ1 pre-associates with TYK2, and IL-12Rβ2 with JAK2 (2Zou J. Presky D.H. Wu C.Y. Gubler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6073-6077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The binding of IL-12 to its receptor activates the JAKs that phosphorylate the tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic region of IL-12Rβ2. Subsequently, the phosphorylated receptors recruit STAT4 through interaction of the STAT4 SH2 domain with the phosphotyrosine at position 800 in the IL-12Rβ2 chain (3Yao B.B. Niu P. Surowy C.S. Faltynek C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Naeger L.K. McKinney J. Salvekar A. Hoey T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). STAT4 then becomes phosphorylated at Tyr693 (5Visconti R. Gadina M. Chiariello M. Chen E.H. Stancato L.F. Gutkind J.S. O'Shea J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), dimerizes, and translocates into the nucleus to activate gene transcription. STAT4 is a critical mediator of IL-12-stimulated gene regulation. STAT4-deficient mice have greatly decreased Th1 cell differentiation and lack many other biological functions mediated by IL-12 signaling (6Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 7Thierfelder W.E. van Deursen J.M. Yamamoto K. Tripp R.A. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Sangster M.Y. Vignali D.A. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 382: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). STAT proteins have several functional domains, including a central DNA-binding domain, an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal transactivation domain (8Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structures of STAT1 and STAT3 (9Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 10Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), STAT proteins also have a coiled-coil domain that may mediate protein-protein interaction (11Zhu M. John S. Berg M. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). An N-terminal domain has also been identified in STAT proteins that, although dispensable for dimerization, is required for the tetramerization that mediates cooperative association with tandem STAT4 DNA-binding sites (12Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of STAT4, comprising the first 124 amino acids, has revealed that it is composed of eight α-helices that assemble into a hook-like structure (13Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Recent studies using retroviral expression in primary T cells and cell lines suggest that the STAT4 N-terminal domain may also be important for STAT4 phosphorylation (14Murphy T.L. Geissal E.D. Farrar J.D. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7121-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, IL-12-stimulated STAT4 activation was not extensively examined. To delineate the function of the N-terminal domain of STAT4 in vivo and to determine which biological functions may require the N-terminal domain, we generated transgenic mice that express full-length STAT4 or a STAT4 mutant (ΔN-STAT4) lacking the N-terminal 51 amino acids, with a deletion of the regions from the N terminus through the fifth α-helix. These mice were mated with STAT4-deficient mice, so transgenic STAT4 is expressed in the absence of endogenous STAT4. Whereas transgenic expression of full-length STAT4 rescued IL-12-stimulated proliferation, Th1 generation, and CD25 induction on the STAT4–/– background, transgenic expression of ΔN-STAT4 did not rescue any of these functions. This correlates with a lack of IL-12-induced phosphorylation of ΔN-STAT4, despite normal activation of JAK2 and TYK2. Further analysis demonstrated that the STAT4 N-terminal domain is required for efficient phosphorylation by JAK2, but is not required for interaction with phosphorylated peptide from the IL-12Rβ2 chain. These results demonstrate a critical role for the N-terminal domain in proximal events leading to the IL-12-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT4. Generation of Transgenic Mice—STAT4–/– mice were previously described (6Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) and backcrossed eight generations to the C57BL/6 genetic background. The cDNAs for human full-length STAT4 and an N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN-STAT4) lacking the N-terminal 51 amino acids were cloned into a vector containing the CD2 locus control region (15Zhumabekov T. Corbella P. Tolaini M. Kioussis D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 16Festenstein R. Tolaini M. Corbella P. Mamalaki C. Parrington J. Fox M. Miliou A. Jones M. Kioussis D. Science. 1996; 271: 1123-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and transgenic mice were generated at the Indiana University Transgenic Facility. Transgenic mice produced on the C3H genetic background were backcrossed to C57BL/6 and two generations to STAT4-deficient C57BL/6 mice to generate STAT4-deficient transgenic mice. Control wild-type mice (C57BL/6) were purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Analysis of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice were analyzed by Southern, Northern, and Western blotting. The genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted from the tails and spleens, respectively. The probes used in Southern and Northern blotting were the cDNAs from human full-length STAT4 labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random decamer reagent (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Alternatively, transgenic mice were typed by PCR using upstream (GAAGGTGATCCCATTCCAATG) and downstream (GTTTCAAACGTTATGGAATGAAGT) primers. Western blotting was carried out on total protein extracted from spleens using anti-STAT4 polyclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal portion of STAT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Proliferation Assay—Cells isolated from spleens and lymph nodes were activated for 72 h with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody to activate T cells and to make them IL-12-responsive. Cells were then plated in triplicate at 5 × 104 cells/well in a round-bottomed 96-well plate in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and stimulated with various doses of IL-12 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) ranging from 0 to 1 ng/ml or with IL-2 (8 ng/ml) for 72 h. Cells were pulsed for the last 16–18 h with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well). The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. CD25 Expression by Flow Cytometry—Splenocytes isolated from mice were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody at 2 μg/ml for 3 days. Cells purified through Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) at 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with IL-2 (2 ng/ml) or with IL-12 (8 ng/ml) and anti-IL-2 antibody (20 μg/ml) to eliminate IL-2-induced CD25 expression or left unstimulated (anti-IL-2 antibody alone). Following overnight incubation, cells were stained with anti-CD25 antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Biosciences). CD25 expression on the activated cell population was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). The mean fluorescence intensity was evaluated by the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). IFN-γ Production by Th1 Cells—CD4+ T cells were isolated by positive selection using MiniMacs beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and differentiated into Th1 cells as described (17Zhang S. Lukacs N.W. Lawless V.A. Kunkel S.L. Kaplan M.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Differentiated Th1 cells were restimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody (2 μg/ml), with IL-12 (2 ng/ml), or with IL-12 (2 ng/ml) and IL-18 (25 ng/ml) for 24 h. The supernatants were collected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the level of IFN-γ production (18Zhang S. Kaplan M.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1374-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein Phosphorylation Analysis by Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells isolated from spleens and lymph nodes were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody at 2 μg/ml for 3 days. Ten million cells purified though Histopaque-1077 were incubated with or without IL-12 at 2 ng/ml for 20 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. In the case of STAT4 phosphorylation, the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate at various doses was included. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with protein lysis buffer (19Lawless V.A. Zhang S. Ozes O.N. Bruns H.A. Oldham I. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Kaplan M.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Total protein extracts (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated individually with anti-JAK2 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or anti-TYK2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphorylated proteins were detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and visualized with a chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). STAT4 phosphorylation was detected using anti-phospho-STAT4 antibody (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA), followed by stripping and reprobing the membranes with polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of STAT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). STAT4 Analysis in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells grown on 6-well plates were transiently transfected using FuGENE reagents (Roche Applied Science) with 1 μg of STAT4 or ΔN-STAT4 plasmid in pcDNA3 with various concentrations of JAK2 plasmid (12Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) ranging from 0 to 250 ng. After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, cells were lysed to extract the total protein. The protein extracts were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE for Western blotting with anti-phospho-STAT4 antibody. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of STAT4. For DNA binding assays, extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with STAT4 or ΔN-STAT4 and JAK2-expressing plasmids were incubated with a biotinylated STAT4-binding site in binding buffer A (25 mm HEPES, 15 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 0.5% Igepal, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) overnight at 4 °C. Streptavidin-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to reactions for 2 h. Complexes were then precipitated and washed twice with binding buffer A. Samples were subjected to Western analysis with anti-phospho-STAT4 antibody. As a control, total phospho-STAT4 levels and total STAT4 levels were determined in total cell extracts. For reporter assays, cells were transfected as described above with 1 μg of STAT4-expressing plasmid, 1 μg of JAK2-expressing plasmid, 0.3 μg of β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid, and 2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid containing two copies of the IFN regulatory factor-1 promoter STAT/cAMP-responsive element-binding site. Total cell extracts were made 48 h later, and luciferase levels were analyzed with a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison WI). Luciferase levels were corrected for transfection efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase levels (Galacto-Light system, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and protein concentration. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Recombinant STAT4 or ΔN-STAT4 protein was expressed by baculovirus in Sf9 insect cells as described previously (12Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Purified STAT4 proteins were incubated with or without JAK2 enzyme-agarose complex (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The phosphorylation of STAT4 was detected by Western blotting with anti-phospho-STAT4 antibody. The blot was stripped and reprobed with polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of STAT4. Peptide Binding Assay—The biotinylated phosphopeptide DLPTHDGpY800LPSNIDD and the identical non-phosphorylated peptide were synthesized (Genemed Biotechnologies, Inc., San Francisco, CA) for the in vitro binding assay. Increasing amounts of total protein extracts (100, 200, and 400 μg) from pooled spleens and lymph nodes were incubated with the biotinylated phosphopeptide (100 nm) overnight at 4 °C in binding buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Igepal). The complex of peptide-bound STAT4 was precipitated by immobilized streptavidin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The precipitation of STAT4 with the biotinylated peptides was evaluated by Western blotting with polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of STAT4. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Mice positive for a transgene of human full-length STAT4 (CD2:STAT4) or an N-terminal deletion mutant (CD2:ΔN-STAT4) lacking the first 51 amino acids (Fig. 1A) were generated on the C57BL/6 STAT4–/– background as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of transgenes in mice was tested by Southern analysis of tail genomic DNA (Fig. 1B) or by PCR. Expression of transgenic STAT4 was confirmed by Northern and Western analyses (Fig. 1B). Two forms of ΔN-STAT4 were observed in some Western analyses (Fig. 1B). This may represent increased degradation of the ΔN-STAT4 form and correlated with relatively low expression despite high STAT4 mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Four founder lines were initially characterized and found to have similar phenotypes. Two CD2:ΔN-STAT4 founder lines (1078 and 1106) were selected and used for detailed analysis. CD2:ΔN-STAT4 Cells Do Not Respond to IL-12—As previously demonstrated, STAT4-deficient activated T cells do not proliferate in response to IL-12 (6Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 7Thierfelder W.E. van Deursen J.M. Yamamoto K. Tripp R.A. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Sangster M.Y. Vignali D.A. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 382: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 20Shen R. Kaplan M.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether the N-terminal portion of STAT4 is required for proliferation of T cells in response to IL-12, we activated spleen cells with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody for 72 h. Cells were then removed from anti-CD3 antibody and incubated in the presence or absence of increasing doses of IL-12. Activated T cells from wild-type and CD2:STAT4 mice demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in IL-12-stimulated proliferation (Fig. 2A). Activated T cells from CD2:ΔN-STAT4 transgenic mice (founder lines 1078 and 1106) failed to proliferate upon IL-12 stimulation, as shown in Fig. 2A. As a control, wild-type, STAT4-deficient, and STAT4 transgenic mice had a similar level of proliferation with IL-2 (Fig. 2B). Thus, ΔN-STAT4 expression is not sufficient to mediate T cell proliferation in response to IL-12. CD25 gene expression is induced by IL-12 in a STAT4-dependent manner (21Guler M.L. Gorham J.D. Dietrich W.F. Murphy T.L. Steen R.G. Parvin C.A. Fenoglio D. Grupe A. Peltz G. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1339-1347PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nishikomori R. Usui T. Wu C.Y. Morinobu A. O'Shea J.J. Strober W. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4388-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The STAT-responsive element in the CD25 promoter has been well characterized and has demonstrated the necessity of the N-terminal domain of STAT5 for IL-2-induced gene expression (23Meyer W.K. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Soldaini E. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31821-31828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, this gene provides an ideal target gene for analysis of N-terminal domain function. Spleen cells were activated with anti-CD3 antibody as described above, and cells were incubated overnight with anti-IL-2 antibody (unstimulated), with IL-12 and anti-IL-2 antibody, or with IL-2. Cells were then stained with fluorescent antibody to CD25. Wild-type and CD2:STAT4 cells demonstrated IL-12-induced CD25 expression, whereas there was no induction of CD25 expression in STAT4-deficient cells (Fig. 3). The diminished induction in CD2:STAT4 cells correlated with lower levels of STAT4 expressed in these cells (Fig. 1). Importantly, CD25 expression was not induced by IL-12 in CD2:ΔN-STAT4 transgenic mice (Fig. 3). Induction of CD25 expression by IL-2 was similar in all genotypes, demonstrating that the CD25 locus is still cytokine-responsive in STAT4-deficient and CD2:ΔN-STAT4 transgenic mice. STAT4 activation following IL-12 stimulation contributes to the development of Th1 cells and is important for the production of IFN-γ, the hallmark cytokine of Th1 cells (24Glimcher L.H. Murphy K.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1693-1711PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined whether CD4 T cells from STAT4 transgenic mice could be polarized into Th1 cells. Purified CD4 T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD28 antibody, IL-12, and anti-IL-4 antibody for 6 days. Cells were then restimulated with anti-CD3 antibody alone, with IL-12 alone, or with IL-12 in combination with IL-18. Wild-type and CD2:STAT4 cells produced significant levels of IFN-γ following each of these stimuli (Fig. 4) (25Broxmeyer H.E. Bruns H.A. Zhang S. Cooper S. Hangoc G. McKenzie A.N.J. Dent A.L. Schindler U. Naeger L.K. Hoey T. Kaplan M.H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 815-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and diminished induction in CD2:STAT4 cells correlated with lower levels of STAT4 expressed in these cells (Fig. 1). As previously described, STAT4-deficient cells are greatly or completely impaired in their ability to produce IFN-γ following anti-CD3 antibody or IL-12 stimulation, respectively (6Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 7Thierfelder W.E. van Deursen J.M. Yamamoto K. Tripp R.A. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Sangster M.Y. Vignali D.A. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 382: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Th1 cultures from the two founder lines (1078 and 1106) of CD2:ΔN-STAT4 transgenic mice produced low levels of IFN-γ following anti-CD3 antibody stimulation and undetectable amounts of IFN-γ following either IL-12 or IL-12 plus IL-18 stimulation (Fig. 4), a phenotype similar to that seen in STAT4-deficient mice. To confirm that Th1 differentiation (and not simply IFN-γ production) was impaired in CD2:ΔN-STAT4 mice, we also examined the expression of Th1-restricted genes, including IL-12Rβ2, lympho-toxin-α, and Ccr5, by Northern analysis. These genes were highly expressed in wild-type Th1 cells, whereas levels were greatly decreased in STAT4-deficient and CD2:ΔN-STAT4 transgenic Th1 cultures (data not shown). Thus, ΔN-STAT4 is not sufficient to mediate Th1 differentiation. The N-terminal Domain Is Required for STAT4 Phosphorylation—Since ΔN-STAT4 was not sufficient to mediate any IL-12-stimulated functions, we next examined the phosphorylation of STAT4 following IL-12 stimulation to confirm normal activation of ΔN-STAT4. IL-12 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 in wild-type and CD2:STAT4 cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, IL-12 did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4 in CD2:ΔN-STAT4 transgenic mice. To increase the sensitivity of phosphotyrosine analysis, sodium orthovanadate, a phosphatase inhibitor, was included during IL-12 stimulation to increase phospho-STAT4 levels. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of increasing levels of the phosphatase inhibitor increased the level of STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation in wild-type and CD2:STAT4 cells. However, even with treatment of the phosphatase inhibitor, STAT4 from CD2:ΔN-STAT4 transgenic cells did not become detectably phosphorylated. We have previously demonstrated that JAK2 and TYK2 activation is normal in STAT4-deficient cells (19Lawless V.A. Zhang S. Ozes O.N. Bruns H.A. Oldham I. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Kaplan M.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether the lack of STAT4 phosphorylation observed in CD2: ΔN-STAT4 transgenic mice resulted from deficient JAK kinase activity, the integrity of the IL-12-activated JAKs JAK2 and TYK2 was evaluated upon IL-12 stimulation. IL-12 induced comparable phosphorylation of JAK2 (Fig. 6A) and TYK2 (Fig. 6B) in wild-type, CD2:STAT4, and CD2:ΔN-STAT4 transgenic cells. Binding of STAT4 to Phosphopeptide Derived from IL-12Rβ2—To begin to determine the nature of the defect in ΔN-STAT4 activation, we first examined the ability of full-length and mutant STAT4 to interact with the IL-12R. The tyrosine at position 800 in the IL-12Rβ2 protein mediates the recruitment of STAT4 to the receptor complex. Furthermore, the binding of STAT4 to this region is specific and occurs only when this tyrosine is phosphorylated (Fig. 7B) (3Yao B.B. Niu P. Surowy C.S. Faltynek C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Naeger L.K. McKinney J. Salvekar A. Hoey T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether ΔN-STAT4 interacts with the IL-12Rβ2 phosphopeptide, we performed a phosphopeptide binding assay using total cell extracts from CD2:STAT4 and CD2:ΔN-STAT4 mice. Direct interaction of ΔN-STAT4 with the phosphopeptide derived from the IL-12Rβ2 subunit was readily observed to a level similar to that of full-length STAT4 with increasing amounts of cell extract (Fig. 7C). Thus, both forms of STAT4 are capable of interacting with the IL-12R. The STAT4 N-terminal Domain Mediates Efficient Phosphorylation—To further characterize the inability of ΔN-STAT4 to be phosphorylated, we transfected COS-7 cells with plasmids expressing full-length STAT4 or ΔN-STAT4 and cotransfected with increasing amounts of JAK2 plasmid DNA. As shown in Fig. 8A, no phospho-STAT4 was detected in the absence of transfected JAK2. However, JAK2 dose-dependent phosphorylation of STAT4 and ΔN-STAT4 was observed when the JAK2 plasmid was cotransfected. The level of phosphorylation was determined by the ratio of phosphorylated STAT4 to total STAT4 protein using densitometry, and the results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 8B. More full-length STAT4 was phosphorylated with lower concentrations of JAK2 compared with ΔN-STAT4, although equal phosphorylation of both forms of STAT4 was detected upon the expression of high levels of JAK2 (Fig. 8B). To confirm these results, we also performed an in vitro kinase assay with recombinant full-length STAT4 and ΔN-STAT4. Recombinant proteins were incubated with a JAK2 enzyme-agarose complex, and phospho-STAT4 was detected by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 8C, phosphorylation of ΔN-STAT4 protein was detectable, but in a much lower level compared with full-length STAT4 proteins. Thus, ΔN-STAT4 is phosphorylated by JAK2 less efficiently compared with full-length STAT4. The N-terminal Domain Is Not Required for Transactivation from a STAT4-responsive Element—Knowing that high levels of JAK2 expression can lead to equivalent activation of full-length STAT4 and ΔN-STAT4, we wanted to test whether both forms would still be capable of binding DNA and activating transcription. We first tested the ability of full-length STAT4 and ΔN-STAT4 to bind DNA by incubating cell extracts from COS-7 cells, which had been transfected with either full-length STAT4 or ΔN-STAT4 in the presence or absence of JAK2 expression, with biotinylated oligonucleotides containing STAT4-binding sites (Fig. 9A). Complexes were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting. Both full-length STAT4 and ΔN-STAT4 were capable of binding to DNA (Fig. 9B). We then tested whether full-length or mutant STAT4 would activate a reporter containing two copies of the IFN regulatory factor-1 promoter STAT/cAMP-responsive element-binding site known to mediate STAT4 transactivation (26Galon J. Sudarshan C. Ito S. Finbloom D. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7256-7262PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding full-length STAT4 or ΔN-STAT4 and the reporter plasmid were transfected into COS-7 cells in the absence or presence of a JAK2 plasmid. Full-length STAT4 and ΔN-STAT4 were capable of equally inducing luciferase activity from the reporter plasmid (Fig. 9C) (12Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Thus, defects in ΔN-STAT4 function are restricted to proximal events during STAT4 phosphorylation. The N-terminal domain of STAT proteins may have several functions based on published reports. To address the importance of the N-terminal domain in STAT4 function, we have generated STAT4–/– transgenic mice expressing ΔN-STAT4, which lacks the N-terminal 51 amino acids. These mice allowed us to characterize the role of the N-terminal domain by examining a wide array of biological assays. Transgenic expression of full-length STAT4 (but not ΔN-STAT4) on a STAT4–/– background rescued IL-12-stimulated biological functions, including proliferation and Th1 differentiation. This was due to the lack of ΔN-STAT4 phosphorylation in transgenic T cells following IL-12 stimulation. We have demonstrated that the lack of phosphorylation in cultured cells was due to reduced efficiency of phosphorylation of ΔN-STAT4 by JAKs. These data support a model wherein the N-terminal domain is required to mediate the biological function of STAT4. In our study using several different systems examining STAT4 phosphorylation in primary transgenic cells (Fig. 5) and in transfected COS-7 cells and in a cell-free reaction (Fig. 8), the ΔN-STAT4 proteins demonstrated decreased tyrosine phosphorylation. Transfection data indicated that the mutant ΔN-STAT4 protein was capable of serving as a substrate, albeit less efficiently, for JAK2. Thus, this deficiency may be overcome when JAK2 is overexpressed (12Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the N-terminal domain may mediate interactions with the IL-12Rβ2 chain. The N-terminal region of STAT2 has been shown to mediate association with the IFNα receptor 2 (27Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of STAT2 with the IFN-α receptor is not required for activation (28Nguyen V.P. Saleh A.Z. Arch A.E. Yan H. Piazza F. Kim J. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9713-9721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and we have shown that transgenic ΔN-STAT4 interacted normally with a phosphopeptide from the IL-12Rβ2 chain. Thus, the Δ1–51 mutation of STAT4 affects the efficiency of phosphorylation by JAKs rather than being required for interactions of STAT4 with the receptor. The precise role of the N-terminal domain of STAT proteins in phosphorylation events is still unclear. We have demonstrated that the ΔN-STAT4 proteins from cells of the transgenic mice were not activated upon IL-12 stimulation as evidenced by undetectable tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5). Specific mutation of Trp37 or double mutation of Lys84 and Arg85 demonstrated a similar role for the STAT4 N-terminal domain in tyrosine phosphorylation (14Murphy T.L. Geissal E.D. Farrar J.D. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7121-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutation of Trp37, which is conserved in all STAT protein N-terminal domains (13Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), results in a lack of STAT4 phosphorylation following IFN-α stimulation in U3A cells and a lack of nuclear STAT4 in IL-12-stimulated primary T cells (14Murphy T.L. Geissal E.D. Farrar J.D. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7121-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of the N-terminal 59 amino acids of STAT2 completely abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation following IFN-α stimulation in U6A cells by a mechanism that is distinct from IFN receptor interaction (28Nguyen V.P. Saleh A.Z. Arch A.E. Yan H. Piazza F. Kim J. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9713-9721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal domain of all STAT proteins does not seem to be required for activation. Truncated STAT1 lacking the N-terminal 61 amino acids displays constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation (30Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, truncated STAT1 lacking the N-terminal 131 amino acids undergoes successful tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro (31Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and deletion of 136 amino acids from the N terminus of STAT5 does not affect IL-3-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (32Wang D. Moriggl R. Stravopodis D. Carpino N. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Feng J. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 392-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the N-terminal domain may have distinct functions in different STAT proteins. The N-terminal domain is required for normal activation of STAT4 and STAT2. In contrast, the N-terminal domain of STAT1 mediates targeting of a STAT1 phosphatase (30Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as well as cellular distribution (33Strehlow I. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28049-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Importantly, the requirement for the N-terminal domain in STAT dimer-dimer interactions leading to stabilization of the protein-DNA complex by cooperative DNA binding has been well documented. Deletion of 88 amino acids from the N terminus of STAT4 does not affect its binding to a single binding site, but abolishes the cooperative binding of two STAT4 dimers to tandem low affinity sites (12Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Similarly, truncated STAT1 lacking the N-terminal 44 residues binds to a single high affinity site, but not to a pair of low affinity sites (12Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Mutation of the invariant Trp37 to alanine in STAT1 or STAT5 eliminates tetramer formation (13Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 34John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The precise nature of the dimerization interface of the STAT proteins is unclear since several examples of mutations that would be predicted to disrupt dimer formation have little effect. Recent analyses of potential dimer interfaces suggest that the interaction may be distinct from that originally predicted (35Chen X. Bhandari R. Vinkemeier U. Van Den Akker F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since the STAT N-terminal domain was crystallized separately from the rest of the STAT protein, it is still unclear how it may interact with other STAT domains. Intraprotein interactions have been shown to be important for receptor interaction and the subsequent activation of STAT3 (36Zhang T. Kee W.H. Sew K.T. Fung W. Cao X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7132-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and this may be important for other STAT proteins as well. Our results suggest that the N-terminal domain of STAT4 may contribute to inter- or intramolecular interactions, which affects its ability to serve as a substrate for JAKs. The potential structural requirements for the N-terminal domain in inter- or intramolecular interactions suggest that distinct mutations could result in proteins that lack activation or that have constitutive activation. Further analysis will be required to determine how this domain mediates distinct STAT protein functions. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Michael J. Grusby for providing the STAT4-deficient mice and Dr. David Donner for the JAK2 plasmid. Recombinant IL-12 was kindly provided by Genetics Institute.

Several residues of motif B of DNA polymerases from families A and B, localized in the fingers subdomain, have been described to be involved in template/primer binding and dNTP selection. Here we complete the analysis of this motif, which has the consensus “KLX 2NSXYG” in DNA polymerases from family B, characterized by mutational analysis of conserved leucine, Leu384 of ϕ29 DNA polymerase. Mutation of Leu384 into Arg resulted in a ϕ29 DNA polymerase with reduced nucleotide insertion fidelity during DNA-primed polymerization and protein-primed initiation reactions. However, the mutation did not alter the intrinsic affinity for the different dNTPs, as shown in the template-independent terminal protein-deoxynucleotidylation reaction. We conclude that Leu384 of ϕ29 DNA polymerase plays an important role in positioning the templating nucleotide at the polymerization active site and in controlling nucleotide insertion fidelity. This agrees with the localization of the corresponding residue in the closed ternary complexes of family A and family B DNA polymerases, contributing to form the binding pocket for the nascent base pair. As an additional effect, mutant polymerase L384R was strongly reduced in DNA binding, resulting in reduced processivity during polymerization.

As an additional effect, mutant polymerase L384R was strongly reduced in DNA binding, resulting in reduced processivity during polymerization. Nucleotide selectivity by DNA polymerases primarily depends on the polymerization active site geometry, which is designed to accept Watson-Crick base pairs and reject base pairs differing from this geometry. dNTP binding induces conformational changes in the DNA polymerase that precede chemical changes and that are more than 10,000 times slower for incorrect than for correct dNTPs. These conformational changes position the incoming nucleotide for catalysis. Additionally, a slower rate of phosphodiester bond formation may further discriminate incorrect dNTPs (reviewed in Ref. 1Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). For the case in which misincorporation could not be prevented, most DNA polymerases contain, besides their DNA-primed 5′-3′ polymerization activity, a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, which plays an important role in correcting incorporation errors, improving the fidelity of the replication process at least 2 orders of magnitude. ϕ29 DNA polymerase, a small 66-kDa monomeric enzyme belonging to the family of the eukaryotic-type DNA replicases (2Bernad A.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Whereas its DNA polymerization activity is highly accurate (discrimination factor between correct and incorrect nucleotides ranges from 104 to 106), protein-primed initiation of TP 1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; DSB, double-stranded DNA-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; DSB, double-stranded DNA-binding protein.-DNA has been shown to be rather inaccurate with a discrimination factor of only 102 (6Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initiation occurs opposite the second 3′-T residue of the TP-DNA template (7Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and consists in the formation of a covalent phosphoester linkage between the hydroxyl group of Ser232 in the TP and 5′-dAMP (8Hermoso J.M. Méndez E. Soriano F. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7715-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) catalyzed by ϕ29 DNA polymerase in the presence of divalent metal ions (9Blanco L. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 82: 6404-6408Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The product, TP-dAMP, is not degraded by the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (6Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the low fidelity of ϕ29 DNA polymerase during initiation would produce a high mutational rate on the initiation product. “Sliding back” of the initiation product in front of the first 3′-T residue of the template strand allows the second nucleotide to serve a second time as template for the following step, the TP-(dAMP)2 formation (7Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This mechanism is proposed to control the fidelity of the initiation reaction. After some transition steps, ϕ29 DNA polymerase replicates each DNA strand, while displacing the other. Due to its high processivity (>70 kb) and strand displacement capacity, this DNA polymerase does not need the help of any helicase or processivity factor to replicate completely its 19-kb linear natural template, the TP-DNA (10Blanco L.

Three functional subdomains responsible for polymerization have been defined by comparison of the crystal structures of several DNA polymerases from families A and B following their structural similarity to a right hand: palm, fingers, and thumb (12Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The palm contains the polymerization active site, while the thumb has been proposed to be important for DNA binding and processivity, and the fingers subdomain was shown to undergo substrate-induced conformational changes upon binding of both DNA and dNTP, rotating toward the palm to form a dNTP-binding pocket (reviewed in Refs. 13Brautigam C. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar and 14Kunkel T.A. Wilson S. Nat. Struct.

Protein Eng. 1990; 6: 461-467Crossref Scopus (572) Google Scholar), located in the fingers subdomain, was shown to be involved in both template/primer binding and dNTP selection in DNA polymerases from families A and B (see Fig. 1). The role of motif B (consensus sequence “KLX 2NSXYG” in family B DNA polymerases) was first studied by site-directed mutagenesis in ϕ29 DNA polymerase: Tyr390 was shown to be involved in DNA-dependent dNTP binding (16Blasco M.A. Lázaro J.M. Bernad A. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19427-19434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and proposed to be directly involved in checking base pairing correctness of the incoming nucleotide (17Saturno J. Blanco L. Salas M. Esteban J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31235-31243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); mutations in Gly391 affected DNA binding, while mutations in Asn387 and Ser388 caused intermediate phenotypes (18Blasco M.A. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16763-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); lately, the invariant Lys383 was shown to be one of the two residues that interact directly with the phosphate groups of the incoming nucleotide (19Saturno J. Lázaro J.M. Esteban F.J. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Truniger V. Lázaro J.M. Esteban F.J. Blanco L. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1482-1493Crossref Google Scholar). In this study we complete the analysis of the KLX 2NSXYG motif (Fig. 1) by assessing the functional importance of its second residue, Leu384 of ϕ29 DNA polymerase. The results indicate that this residue is important for positioning the templating nucleotide at the polymerization active site, thus controlling nucleotide insertion fidelity during template-directed TP-primed initiation and DNA-primed polymerization. Nucleotides and Proteins—Unlabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endo-nucleases were from New England Biolabs. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Roche Applied Science. ϕ29 TP-DNA was isolated according to Peñalva and Salas (21Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The TP was purified as described by Zaballos and Salas (22Zaballos A. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10353-10366Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ϕ29 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and the double-stranded DNA-binding protein (DSB) p6, obtained from Bacillus subtilis cells infected with phage ϕ29, were purified as described previously (23Martín G. Lázaro J.M. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Pastrana R. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. García J.A. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3083-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). DNA Templates and Substrates—Oligonucleotides sp1 (5′-GATCACAGTGAGTAC), sp1c+18 (5′-ACTGGCCGTCGTTCTATTGTACTCACTGTGATC), sp1c+13 (5′-ACTGGCCGTCGTTGTACTCACTGTGATC), and sp1c+6 (5′-TCTATTGTACTCACTGTGATC) that have a 5′-extension of 18, 13, and 6 nucleotides, respectively, in addition to the sequence complementary to sp1, and the three variations of the last oligonucleotide (sp1c+6) differing in the first template base when hybridized to sp1 (position 6 from the 5′-end (underlined) is an A, C, or G residue), were obtained from ISOGEN. The oligonucleotide sp1 was first purified by electrophoresis on 8 m urea-20% polyacrylamide gels and then 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. To analyze the exonuclease and polymerization activities on a template/primer structure, 5′-labeled sp1 was hybridized either to sp1c+18, sp1c+13 or sp1c+6, or any of its variations, in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl and 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. To analyze processive DNA polymerization coupled to strand displacement by ϕ29 DNA polymerase, the universal primer (Roche Applied Science) was hybridized to M13mp8 ssDNA as described above, and the resulting molecule was used as a primer/template suitable for a rolling circle type of DNA replication. The sequences of oligonucleotides oriR29 (29-mer) and its complementary strand were identical to those of the right origin of ϕ29 DNA (7Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of ϕ29 DNA Polymerase Mutants—The wild-type ϕ29 DNA polymerase gene, cloned into M13mp19 (M13mp19w21; Ref. 25Bernad A. Blanco L. Lázaro J.M. Martín G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), was used for site-directed mutagenesis, carried out essentially as described previously (26Nakamaye K. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9679-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), using the oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis kit from Amersham Biosciences. The fragments carrying the different mutations were sub-cloned in plasmid pT7-4w2 (27Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which expresses ϕ29 DNA polymerase under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase-specific ϕ10 promoter (28Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of any other changes were confirmed by complete sequencing of each ϕ29 DNA polymerase mutant gene. Sequencing was carried out by the chain termination method, using Sequenase, version 2.0, from United States Biochemical Corp. and a set of synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to the ϕ29 DNA polymerase gene as sequencing primers. Expression of the mutant proteins was carried out in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS, which contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible lacUV5 promoter, and a plasmid constitutively expressing T7 lysozyme (29Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 30Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). The purification of wild-type and mutant ϕ29 DNA polymerases was done as described by Lázaro et al. (27Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Buffers—The 10× reaction buffer (RB) used in all assays contained: 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The buffer used for dilution of the polymerase contained: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50% glycerol. DNA Gel Retardation Assay—The interaction of either wild-type or mutant ϕ29 DNA polymerase with a template/primer structure was assayed using the 5′-labeled sp1/sp1c+6 (15/21-mer) hybrid. The incubation mixture, in a final volume of 20 μl, contained 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.2 nm 5′-labeled sp1/sp1c+6, and, as indicated, a 1.2, 4.2, 8.4, or 16.8 nm concentration of either wild-type or mutant ϕ29 DNA polymerase (31Méndez J. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30030-30038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 5 min at 4 °C, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (80:1, monomer:bis), containing 12 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, and run at 4 °C in the same buffer at 8 V/cm, essentially as described previously (32Carthew R.W. Chodosch L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, stable enzyme/DNA interaction was detected as a shift in the position of the free labeled DNA and quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiograms corresponding to different experiments. Polymerase/3′-5′ Exonuclease Coupled Assay—The hybrid molecule sp1/sp1c+6 (15/21 mer) contains a 6-nucleotide long 5′-protruding end, and therefore, the primer strand can be used both as substrate for the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and also for DNA-dependent DNA polymerization. The reaction mixture, in a final volume of 12.5 μl, contained: 1.25 μl of RB, 10 mm MgCl2, a 1.2 nm concentration of 5′-labeled hybrid molecule (sp1/sp1c+6), a 16.8 nm concentration of either wild-type or mutant ϕ29 DNA polymerase, and the indicated increasing concentrations of the four dNTPs. If indicated, after preincubation of the DNA polymerase with the labeled DNA (15/33-mer) for 10 min on ice, a 122-fold molar excess of the same but unlabeled hybrid molecule was added as trap at the same time as the reaction was started with Mg2+ and 1 μm dNTP. After incubation for 5 min at 25 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of 3 μl of sequencing loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by 8 m urea-20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Polymerization or 3′-5′ exonucleolysis were detected as an increase or decrease, respectively, in the size (15-mer) of the 5′-labeled sp1 primer. The exonucleolytic activity was calculated from the intensity of each degradation product, obtained by densitometry of the autoradiograms, corrected (multiplied) by the number of catalytic events giving rise to each of these degradation products. From these data, the catalytic efficiency (indicated in Table I) of each mutant derivative, assayed in linear conditions both in time and enzyme amount, was calculated relative to wild-type ϕ29 DNA polymerase.Table IEnzymatic activities of the mutant derivatives of ϕ29 DNA polymerase The analysis of the base specificity during DNA-primed polymerization was studied in two experiments: the first was a truncated polymerization experiment using the template/primer structure (sp1/sp1c+13) and 1, 5, 25, and 100 μm concentrations of dATP, dCTP, and dTTP. The reactions were performed as described above for the pol/exo-coupled assay, but incubated on ice to reduce exonucleolytic degradation. The second experiment was performed with the four possible variations of the template/primer structure (sp1/sp1c+6), differing only in the first template base (position 16), by separate addition of each of the four dNTPs at 100 μm and incubation on ice to reduce exonucleolytic degradation. Replication of Primed M13-DNA—The reaction mixture, in a final volume of 25 μl, contained: 2.5 μl of RB, 10 mm MgCl2, a 20 μm concentration each of the four dNTPs, 13 nm [α-32P]dATP (2 μCi), 4.2 nm oligonucleotide-primed M13 ssDNA, and a 16.8 nm concentration of either wild-type or mutant ϕ29 DNA polymerase. If indicated, a 36 μm concentration of the ϕ29 SSB was added to the reaction. After incubation for the indicated times at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS. After filtration through Sephadex G-50 spin columns, the Cerenkov radiation of the excluded volume was determined to calculate the amount of incorporated dNMPs during this reaction. Elongation was studied by alkaline 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis (33McDonnell M.W. Simon M.N. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The position of unit length ϕ29 DNA in the agarose gels was detected by ethidium bromide staining. The autoradiogram of the dried gels revealed the elongation efficiency. Protein-primed Initiation Assay—The formation of TP-dAMP was performed either with or without TP-DNA as template. In both cases the reaction mixture, in a final volume of 25 μl, contained: 2.5 μl of RB, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.1 μm [α-32P]dATP (2 μCi), 83.2 nm purified TP, and a 16.8 nm concentration of either wild-type or mutant ϕ29 DNA polymerase. When indicated, 34 μm p6 were added to the reaction. In the template-dependent assay (with 1.6 nm TP-DNA), 10 mm MgCl2 was used as metal activator, and the incubation time was for 5 min at 30 °C. The assay without template was performed with 1 mm MnCl2 as metal activator (known to reduce the Km for the initiating nucleotide of the ϕ29 wild-type DNA polymerase; Ref. 6Esteban J.A. Salas M. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2719-2726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the incubation was for 4 h at 30 °C. TP-primed initiation on an oligonucleotide (ss-oriR or ds-oriR, 29 mer) was performed as described by Méndez et al. (7Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using the reaction mixture described above with a 72 nm concentration of the respective DNA polymerase, 154 nm TP, 0.85 μm oriR (ds or ss), 10 mm MgCl2 as the metal activator and incubating the samples for 10 min at 15 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, filtration through Sephadex G-50 spin columns (in the presence of 0.1% SDS), and further analysis by SDS-PAGE as described previously (21Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The TP-dAMP complex was detected by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometric analysis. To calculate the Michaelis-Menten constant for dATP binding (Km and V max) in the TP-DNA initiation reaction, different dATP concentrations and incubation times were assayed. Initiation fidelity was studied in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 and either 10 μm [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dGTP, or [α-32P]dTTP (5 μCi). The assay was performed as described above. TP-DNA Replication (Protein-primed Initiation, Transition, and Elongation)—The incubation mixture of the truncated replication experiments (in the absence of dCTP) contained, in a final volume of 25 μl: 2.5 μl of RB, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 1.6 nm TP-DNA, a 83.2 nm concentration of purified TP, a 10 μm concentration of each dGTP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP (2 μCi), 10 mm MgCl2, a 16.8 nm concentration of the corresponding DNA polymerase, and 34 μm p6 when indicated. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min the reactions were stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and the samples were filtered through Sephadex G50 spin columns in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Separation of TP-dAMP from TP-(dAMP)2 and the truncated transition products was carried out in SDS-containing 12% polyacrylamide gels (360 × 280 × 0.5 mm) as described previously (7Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and detected by autoradiography. Quantitation was performed by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms. The incubation mixture of the TP-DNA replication reaction was as described above, but with a 20 μm concentration of the four dNTPs. The incubation time at 30 °C was 5, 15, and 60 min. The Cerenkov radiation in the excluded volume after filtration through Sephadex G50 spin columns was measured and used for quantitation. Elongation was studied by alkaline 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis (33McDonnell M.W. Simon M.N. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The position of unit length ϕ29 DNA in the agarose gels was detected by ethidium bromide staining. The autoradiogram of the dried gels revealed the elongation efficiency. Conservation of the Second Residue of the KLX2NSXYG Motif in DNA-dependent DNA Polymerases—The amino acid residue next to the invariant Lys of motif B, Leu384 in ϕ29 DNA polymerase, is highly conserved as a non-polar amino acid (Leu, Ile, Val, or Ala) in DNA-dependent DNA polymerases (19Saturno J. Lázaro J.M. Esteban F.J. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Only in two out of 35 family B DNA polymerases a non-conservative residue (Arg) can be found. Family A DNA polymerases show a preference for the non-polar Ala, Val, and Ile with four exceptions (three of them Thr) out of nine sequences. Because of its location in family A and family B DNA polymerases at the polymerization active site (Fig. 1) and its high conservation, especially in family B DNA polymerases, residue Leu384 of ϕ29 DNA polymerase (belonging to this group) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Since this residue was conserved as non-polar amino acid in most of the other DNA polymerase sequences (Ile and Val), it was decided to substitute it with either a polar (Gln) or a positively charged (Arg) amino acid. These mutations were designed according to general suggestions for conservative substitutions (34Bordo D. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and secondary structure predictions (35Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar, 36Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant ϕ29 DNA polymerases were purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Leu384 of ϕ29 DNA Polymerase Is Involved in DNA Binding—The interaction of the wild-type and mutant ϕ29 DNA polymerases with a template/primer structure was studied by gel retardation assays (described under “Experimental Procedures”). In a native gel the wild-type enzyme bound to the template/primer structure results in a single retardation band (see Fig. 2), which most likely corresponds to a protein-DNA interaction in which the primer-terminus is stabilized at the polymerization active site (31Méndez J. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30030-30038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both mutations in residue Leu384 caused a reduction in the DNA binding ability of ϕ29 DNA polymerase (see Fig. 2 and Table I). Whereas mutant L384Q was about 2-fold reduced in DNA binding capacity, mutant DNA polymerase L384R was especially affected in forming a stable DNA polymerase-DNA complex, resulting in retardation of the labeled DNA along the whole lane (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained when a labeled ssDNA oligonucleotide was used (not shown). It should be noticed that the faint retardation band corresponding to the mutant DNA polymerase L384R-DNA complex run at a slightly different position than the wild-type DNA polymerase-DNA complex (Fig. 2). This fact reflects an abnormal binding that could be due to a change in the orientation/stabilization of the 3′-end of the substrate. An alteration like this could be induced by the loss of a specific contact with the hydrophobic portion of the nitrogen bases of the DNA or by the introduction of a longer and positively charged side chain in close proximity to the ssDNA binding region. The poor stability of the L384R-DNA complex, evidenced by the smeared retardation products, together with the altered mobility obtained could explain its reduced 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (see Table I). Exonucleolysis to Polymerization Switching by ϕ29 DNA Polymerase Mutants at Leu384—The pol/exo balance not only depends on the polymerization and exonuclease activities, but also on the affinity of the polymerization active site for the nucleotides and on the partition of the primer strand between both active sites. Exonucleolysis to polymerization switching can be monitored by increasing the dNTP concentration progressively (polymerase/3′-5′ exonuclease coupled assay, see “Experimental Procedures”). As it can be seen in Fig. 3, different dNTP concentrations are required for the wild-type ϕ29 DNA polymerase to start replication and polymerize the first nucleotide (25 nm, from position 15 to 16), to compete effectively the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity replicating up to the penultimate nucleotide (100 nm, from position 16 to 20) and to replicate the last nucleotide of the template (1 μm, from position 20 to 21). Mutant DNA polymerase L384Q was able to perform the different polymerization steps at the same dNTP concentrations as the wild-type DNA polymerase (Fig. 3). Its exonuclease activity, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” seemed to be slightly impaired (Table I) paralleling its mild defect in DNA binding. On the other hand, the exonuclease activity of mutant DNA polymerase L384R was strongly affected (Table I), paralleling its defect in DNA binding capacity. This mutant polymerase was able to polymerize the first nucleotide at a 25 times lower dNTP concentration (1 nm) than the wild-type DNA polymerase, but also needed 100 nm dNTPs to replicate the template/primer substrate from position 16 to 20 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, it was able to insert the 6th nucleotide in front of the last nucleotide of the template (position 21) at 100 nm dNTPs, a 10 times lower concentration than the wild-type DNA polymerase (see Fig. 3). A possible explanation for this polymerization phenotype of mutant DNA polymerase L384R could be that its reduced exonuclease activity favors especially the first and last polymerization steps.

In the present study, to determine the exact location of the labeled serine residue, the labeled 23-kDa peptide fragment was isolated. The subsequent extensive proteolytic digestion of the peptide fragment yielded two labeled peptides, a pentapeptide and its precursor nonapeptide. Amino acid sequence and composition analyses of both labeled peptides revealed that the anthroyl group is attached to Ser-181 involved in the phosphate binding loop for ATP (Smith, C.

Thus ANN is proved to be a valuable fluorescent tool to identify peptides containing the phosphate binding loop of S1 and to detect the conformational changes around this loop.

During ATP hydrolysis in the actomyosin complex, transient conformational changes in the ATPase site take place and are thought to be transmitted to the remote actin-binding site, thereby controlling the interaction of S1 with actin (3Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the binding of actin to S1 is supposed to affect the conformation of the ATPase site, resulting in the acceleration of product release. Thus, elucidation of the mechanism of the energy transduction process in muscle contraction requires detailed knowledge of conformational changes of S1 that are involved in such communication between the ATPase- and actin-binding sites. One approach for monitoring the ligand-induced conformational changes around a specific residue in proteins is to attach a sensitive fluorescent probe covalently to the residue. Because of its inherent high sensitivity, such a method is a powerful technique to obtain information about the conformational changes in proteins. However, in the case of tyrosine, threonine, and serine residues it is difficult to label them by a fluorescent reagent because the chemical reactivity of their hydroxyl groups in aqueous solution is low. This is also the case for S1. Although a series of photoactive analogs of ATP can modify Ser-181, Ser-243, and Ser-324 of S1 heavy chain (4Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol.

ANN appeared as a unique example of the serine-directed fluorescent reagent (7Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ANN can esterify a serine residue of S1 located within the NH2-terminal 23-kDa peptide segment of the heavy chain (residues 2–204). It is characteristic that the labeling is highly selective and accelerated by nucleotides. The extrinsic fluorescence from the AN group labeled to S1 is sensitive to the binding of nucleotides and ATP hydrolysis (8Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18786-18790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18791-18796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the AN group is useful not only as a fluorescent tag for the 23-kDa segment of S1 heavy chain (10Bettache N. Bertrand R. Kassab R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11Blotnick E. Muhlrad A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6867-6876Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) but also as a fluorescent conformation probe for the S1 ATPase (8Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18786-18790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18791-18796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the chemical determination of the exact location of the labeled serine residue has yet not been done. In the present study, we isolate the pentapeptide and its precursor nonapeptide containing the AN group-labeled Ser-181, which is involved in the phosphate binding loop at the ATPase site of S1 (residues 179–186 of the heavy chain) (1Rayment I.

Chem. 1990; 265: 4893-4901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest that Ser-181 in S1 exhibits unusual reactivity as well as the reactive serine at the active site in serine peptidases (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Labeling with ANN promises to be a valuable method to identify the peptides containing the phosphate binding loop of S1 and to detect ligand-induced conformational changes around this loop. Materials—The commercial compounds used and their sources were as follows: ANN, LEP, and V8 (Wako Pure Chemicals Co.); CT, diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and SerNAc (Sigma); ATP (Kohjin Co.); Ultrogel AcA44 (IBF Biotechnics). AN-SerNAc was prepared as described previously (8Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18786-18790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Preparation—Rabbit skeletal myosin and chymotryptic S1 were prepared as described previously (8Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18786-18790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AN-S1, S1 labeled with ANN in the presence of ATP, was prepared as described previously (7Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled S1 contained 0.9 mol of AN group/mol of S1. Isolation of the 23-kDa Tryptic Fragment from AN-S1—Experiments were carried out using the following buffers: buffer A (40 mm KCl and 5 mm 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, pH 7.0), buffer B (0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0), and buffer C (6 m urea, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8). The lyophilized AN-S1 (160 mg) was dissolved in 26 ml of buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer at 4 °C overnight. The AN-S1 was digested with trypsin (1.6 mg) at 25 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (2.4 mg). Dithiothreitol, Gdn-HCl, and EDTA were added to 2 mm, 6 m, and 2 mm, respectively, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Then 3 volumes of cold ethanol were added to remove the COOH-terminal 20-kDa fragment and most of the 50-kDa fragment of S1 heavy chain and light chains. After the sample was left for 9 h at –30 °C, the resulting precipitate containing the 23-kDa fragment and a small amount of the 50-kDa fragment was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 5 ml of buffer B, and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. The dialysate was then applied to an Ultrogel AcA44 gel filtration column (2.2 × 84 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. Elution with buffer B was carried out at a flow rate of 17 ml/h, and fractions of 3.4 ml were collected. Fractions containing the fluorescent 23-kDa tryptic fragment detected by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C. The dialysate was then passed through a Dowex 1×2 column pre-equilibrated with buffer C. Fractions showing fluorescence were collected and pooled, followed by dialysis against water for 2 days. The dialysate was lyophilized and subjected to isolation of the labeled peptide by HPLC. Isolation of Labeled Peptides—The fluorescent 23-kDa fragment (4.5 mg/ml) was first digested by LEP (0.18 mg/ml) in 7.4 m urea, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. Digestion was performed at 25 °C for 24 h and terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2. After passage through a membrane filter (Millipore Ultrafree-MC, 0.45 μm), the digest was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on a TSK-gel (ODS-80TS) packed column (4.6 × 250 mm) connected to a TOSOH SC-8020 HPLC system. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 25 °C. The elution was monitored at 225 nm (for peptides) and 360 nm (for the labeled AN group). The labeled peptide was eluted from the column as a single peak. Aliquots of the peptide (48 μm with respect to the AN group) were next digested at 25 °C with CT (2.3 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, for 23 h. After another addition of 2.3 μm CT, digestion was further continued for 25 h, followed by the addition of 0.5 m ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) and V8. Final concentrations of the peptides, the ammonium acetate buffer, and V8 were 36 μm, 0.1 m, and 1.5 μm, respectively. Digestion with V8 was performed at 25 °C for 24 h and terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid. After passage through the membrane filter, the digest was applied to HPLC as described above. The labeled peptides were eluted from the column as two peaks. Each peptide fraction was subjected to spectral measurements and amino acid sequence and composition analyses. Amino Acid Sequence and Composition Analyses—The amino acid sequence of a peptide was determined from the amino terminus using a pulse-liquid protein sequencer, Procise 492 (Applied Biosystems). The amino acid composition of a peptide was determined using an AccQ-Tag™ amino acid analysis system (Waters) after vapor phase acid hydrolysis with 7 m HCl, 10% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% phenol at 160 °C for 30 min. Spectral Measurements—Absorption spectra were measured at room temperature with a Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometer. Amounts of the AN group labeled to S1 and peptides were estimated using an absorption coefficient of 8.4 × 103m–1·cm–1 at 361 nm (7Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra (uncorrected) were recorded at 25 °C in a JASCO FP-770 spectrofluorometer as described previously (8Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18786-18790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been well established that ANN reacts with S1, selectively labeling a serine residue in the NH2-terminal 23-kDa peptide segment of the heavy chain, to yield fluorescent AN-S1 (7Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, to identify an exact labeled residue in the 23-kDa segment, the labeled 23-kDa peptide fragment and its proteolytic products, labeled oligopeptides, were isolated. AN-S1 was digested with trypsin, fractionated with ethanol in the presence of 6 m Gdn-HCl, and applied to Ultrogel AcA44 gel filtration in the presence of SDS (Fig. 1). The fluorescent 23-kDa fragment detected by SDS-PAGE was obtained in the second peak (indicated by a solid bar). After removal of SDS, the labeled 23-kDa fragment was subjected to further digestion as described below. The 23-kDa tryptic fragment of rabbit skeletal S1 contains 12 serine residues (6Tong S.W. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4893-4901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the fluorescent 23-kDa tryptic fragment was first digested with LEP, and the digest was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC. When the AN group attached to the peptides was monitored by the absorption at 360 nm, the AN group-labeled peptide denoted by L eluted as a single peak at 49 min (Fig. 2A). This labeled peptide was isolated and further digested with CT and subsequently with V8. The digest was subjected to HPLC to yield two labeled peptides denoted by the letters V and C (Fig. 2B). HPLC inspections of aliquots of the reaction mixture revealed that peptide C, which was produced by CT digestion of peptide L, was converted to peptide V upon digestion by V8 (not shown). Peptides V and C were characterized by sequencing (Fig. 3). For both peptides, lysine was identified at the last cycle and no further PTH-amino acids were found. The peptide V was a pentapeptide with a sequence of SGAGK, identical to residues 181–185 in the chicken skeletal S1 heavy chain (6Tong S.W. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4893-4901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The peptide C was a nonapeptide with a sequence of ITGES-GAGK, identical to residues 177–185, a precursor of peptide V (Fig. 3B). These results were consistent with the observation that peptide V was produced from peptide C by V8 digestion (Fig. 2B). However, it should be noted that yields (6–10%) for PTH-Ser-181 of both peptides were significantly lower than that (31%) for PTH-Glu-180 (peptide C) and those (26–31%) for PTH-Gly-182 (both peptides). The results are reminiscent of the previous reports that an abnormally low yield of PTH derivative for serine residue can be considered an indication of the presence of the chemically modified serine residue in peptides (13Wang Y. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Bell A.W. Hermodson M.A. Roach P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Yun H-Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5663-5670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using procedures and instruments similar to those in the present analysis, 5–10-fold lower yields of PTH derivatives for the esterified serine residues but not for nonesterified ones have been reported (13Wang Y. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Bell A.W. Hermodson M.A. Roach P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Yun H-Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5663-5670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence data for peptides V and C suggest that Ser-181 has been esterified by ANN. To further confirm this point we next determined the amino acid compositions of both these peptides (Table I). The analysis revealed the existence of 0.8–0.9 mol of serine residue/mol of each peptide, which was not fully detected by the sequencing (Fig. 3). The results suggest that serine residues are regenerated from the labeled residues by acid hydrolysis treatment for the amino acid analysis. This was confirmed by a control experiment in which the attached AN group of AN-SerNAc was found to be released by such a treatment. Thus, we concluded from the sequence data (Fig. 3) and the amino acid compositions (Table I) that a single serine residue in peptides V and C, Ser-181, was labeled with ANN.Table IAmino acid compositions and amounts of the labeled AN group of peptides V and CAmino acidActual theoryPeptide VaThe labeled peptide, which was obtained by HPLC as specified in Fig. 2B, was subjected to amino acid analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Peptide CaThe labeled peptide, which was obtained by HPLC as specified in Fig. 2B, was subjected to amino acid analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.”residues/molD/N0.100.20S0.910.81E/Q0.201.01G2.223.23H0.000.00R0.000.10T0.100.71A1.011.11P0.000.10C0.000.00Y0.200.30V0.100.10M0.000.00K1.011.01I0.100.91L0.100.20F0.100.10Total59PositionbThe positions of the amino acid sequences are expressed as corresponding numbers of chicken skeletal S1 heavy chain (6).181-185177-185AN groupcThe concentrations of AN group were determined spectrophotometrically.

Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Open table in a new tab Although data are not shown, the fluorescence and absorption spectra of peptide V were measured and compared with those of a model compound, AN-SerNAc. There was no significant difference in the fluorescence spectrum in 80% acetonitrile between peptide V and AN-SerNAc with fluorescence emission peaks at 474 and 471 nm, respectively. This was also the case for the absorption spectra. The spectrum of AN-SerNAc exhibited four maxima at the longer wavelengths (332, 346, 363, and 382 nm) that had been established to be associated entirely with the AN group (7Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectrum of peptide V also exhibited similar four maxima at 333, 349, 364, and 384 nm. This spectrum was identical to that of peptide C. Because both peptides V and C contain no chromophoric amino acid residues (Table I), the amounts of the AN group labeled to peptides can be estimated from the absorption spectrum of the AN group. The two obtained values, 0.73 and 0.72 mol of AN group/mol of peptide for peptides V and C, respectively, were essentially identical (Table I). The results indicate again that peptide C is a precursor of peptide V, supporting our assignment of the peptide sequences (Fig. 3). These spectral data for the labeled peptides strengthen the conclusion that only Ser-181 is selectively labeled with ANN. In the present study, we have shown that Ser-181 in S1 heavy chain is specifically esterified with ANN. A specific reaction of Ser-181 was already reported by Cremo et al. (4Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6608-6611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UV irradiation of the S1 complex with Mg·ADP·Vi, which is believed to mimic either the metastable ADP·Pi state or the transition state for ATP hydrolysis (16Goodno C.C. Taylor E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), resulted in a specific Vi-induced photooxidation by which Ser-181 is converted to a “serine aldehyde” (17Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8415-8420Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because Vi in this complex mimics the γ-phosphate in the S1 complex with ATP, such a Vi-induced reaction served to identify a critically important serine residue in the coordination of the γ-phosphate of ATP. This result was verified by the x-ray structure of the S1 complex with Mg·ADP·Vi (18Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure revealed that Ser-181 is included in the phosphate binding loop for nucleotides and its side chain is involved in coordination of Vi that mimics the γ-phosphate of ATP. It is surprising that the labeling reaction of S1 with ANN is highly selective. Even when a 50-fold molar excess of ANN over S1 was used, only one serine residue, Ser-181, out of the 42 serine residues in the S1 heavy chain was labeled (Ref. 7Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and present results). In the case of the photo-modification reaction (4Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6608-6611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is reasonable that Ser-181 is specifically oxidized by the Vi-induced reaction, because Ser-181 is adjacent to Vi coordinated with its oxygen atom in the S1 complex with Mg·ADP·Vi (18Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, it is unusual that ANN with structure dissimilar to a nucleotide can approach Ser-181 and result in a selective esterification of the residue. One possible explanation for such an unusual specificity for the ANN labeling is that ANN forms a non-covalent complex with S1 prior to the reaction in which the functional group of ANN is in a favorable position for a subsequent esterification of Ser-181. In fact, the selective labeling of Ser-181 was not observed upon the labeling of S1 with a structural isomer of ANN, 1-anthroylnitrile, in which the functional group acylnitrile is at C1 of the anthracene ring instead of its C9 in ANN, 2T. Hiratsuka, unpublished result. suggesting that its functional group was not situated near Ser-181. It is also likely that a hydrophobic pocket near Ser-181 composed of Ser-243, Ser-244, Phe-246, Gly-247, Ala-465, Gly-466, and Phe-467 (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 2Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), interacts with the anthracene moiety of ANN and helps the acylnitrile moiety to approach Ser-181, resulting in the specific labeling of the residue. The first pentapeptide sequence in the phosphate binding loop of the S1 ATPase site (GESGA, residues 179–183 of S1 heavy chain) is equivalent to a highly conserved pentapeptide sequence GXSXG/A found around active serine residues in serine peptidases (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Serine peptidases occur in three distinct structural families, represented by CT, subtilisin, and wheat serine carboxypeptidase II. The CT-like enzymes have glycine in the fifth position of the pentapeptide sequence. On the other hand, the latter two enzymes have another small amino acid, alanine, in this position. This is also the case for the peptide sequence of S1. It should be emphasized that among all the 42 serine residues in the S1 heavy chain only Ser-181 is in the sequence GXSXG/A (6Tong S.W. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4893-4901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such pentapeptide segments form a tight turn in motifs of strand-turn-helix, which confers a reactive nature of the serine residue in the third position (12Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This may be why Ser-181 of S1 has unusual reactivity against ANN. It is interesting to compare the enzymatic properties of AN-S1 (7Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with those of the photo-modified S1 (19Grammer J.C. Cremo C.R. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8408-8415Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In both S1 derivatives, Ser-181 is chemically modified. AN-S1 had Mg2+-ATPase activity 2.2-fold higher than that of the control S1, whereas the K+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities were below 30% of the control. The photo-modified S1 had Ca2+-ATPase activity 4–5-fold higher than that of the control S1, whereas the K+-ATPase activity was below 10% of the control. It is clear that a chemical modification of Ser-181 itself does not result in abolishment of the S1 ATPase activity. Thus, the Mg2+-ATPase reaction of AN-S1 can be monitored continuously by changes in fluorescence emitted from the AN group attached to S1 (8Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18786-18790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hiratsuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18791-18796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of the present study, we became aware of a study carried out by Szarka et al. (20Szarka K. Bódis E. Visegrády B. Nyitrai M. Kilár F. Somogyi B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14806-14811Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To obtain information about the labeling sites with ANN in S1, they measured the distances between the AN group labeled to S1 and known positions of S1 (Lys-553 and Cys-707) using the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. They suggested that the most probable labeled residue is Ser-181, consistent with our present result.
