https://openalex.org/W2016290420,"A rapid, convenient technique for precision pressure measurement in the diamond-anvil high-pressure cell, which makes use of the sharp-line (R-line) luminescence of ruby, has been developed. The observed shift is -0.77 +/-0.03 reciprocal centimeters per kilobar for R(1) and -0.84+/- 0.03 reciprocal centimeters per kilobar for R(2) to lower energy and is approximately linear in the range studied (to 22 kilobars). Line-broadening has been observed in some instances and has been tentatively identified with nonhydrostatic conditions surrounding the ruby sample."
https://openalex.org/W2024267192,"The dry valleys of South Victoria Land, Antarctica, together with a few other ice-free areas on the perimeter
of the Antarctic continent, form what is generally considered to be the most extreme cold-desert region of the earth. During the past S years, we have been interested in the dry valleys as a model environment for investigating questions connected with the biological exploration
o£ Mars. The extraordinary aridity of the region, its low temperature, and its geographical isolation give it a quasimartian character, although it is to be
understood that the actual martian environment is still more hostile than that of the valleys. With our associates, we have investigated the kinds, numbers, and distribution of soil microorganisms in the valleys in order to gain insight into the practical problems of searching for life in an extreme environment. Detailed results of these studies have been published by Cameron and co-workers (1-5). In this-article, we review the major findings of our own and of other groups of investigators in this region,
especially as they apply to martian exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2008544821,"Application of a comprehensive wave climate program to seven major deltas indicates that deltaic configurations and coastal landform combinations depend to a considerable degree on the wave power adjacent to the shore and on the river discharge relative to wave forces. Nearshore wave power is not correlative with deepwater wave power but, owing to frictional attenuation, is a function of the subaqueous slope. The subaqueous slope, in turn, depends partially on the slope and width of the continental shelf but primarily on the rate at which the river can supply sediments to the nearshore zone. River-dominated configurations result only when the river is able to build flat offshore profiles, which reduce nearshore wave power; where the subaqueous slope is steep, waves reach the shore comparatively undiminished and wave-built forms prevail."

https://openalex.org/W2091799690,"If the unexplained fission xenon component in meteorites is due to a volatile superheavy element, this element must have had a heat of vaporization of 54 ± 3 kilocalories per mole and a normal boiling point of 2500° ± 400°K. The prime candidates are elements 111 and 115, followed by 113, 114, 112, and 116. Elements 105 to 110 are not volatile enough and can therefore be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1990480777,"Measurements of spectral emittance in the infrared region from 6.8 to 13.3 micrometers were made with an airborne spectrometer at a rate of six spectra per second, on flights 650 meters above the olivine basalt flows at Pisgah Crater in the southern Californian desert. The spectra show chemical and mineralogical differences that can be related to differences in the terrain below the aircraft."
https://openalex.org/W1990743236,"Analysis of the Mariner 4, Mariner 6, and Mariner 7 photographs shows that Mars has at least two distinct types of lineament systems. The most prominent is a well-developed global-type system. The second consists of radial and concentric lineaments associated with the Hellas and south polar basins."
https://openalex.org/W1987101209,"Topical application of as little as 5x10(-12) moles of pure siderochromes (polyhydroxamate iron-transport compounds from bacteria and fungi) onto detached bean leaves causes spots of chlorophyll retention that are surrounded by chlorotic halos. These spots appear similar to ""green islands"" that are caused by certain fungal infections on leaves and are somewhat similar to zones where senescence is delayed by cytokinin."
https://openalex.org/W2150696512,"The modern sea star Platasterias latiradiata, on the basis of ossicle morphology, is removed from the fossil subclass Somasteroidea and assigned to the genus Luidia of the living subclass Asteroidea. A somasteroid assignment of this species should not be used in inferences concerning evolution and morphology of primitive echinoderms."

One hundred years ago Stokes discovered several laws that are very applicable to-day. For apparatus he used a boarded-up window, a slit in a plank, a lens and a prism. Instead of thinking how much we have accomplished with highly refined instruments we biochemists should rather humble ourselves by thinking how little use we have made of the instruments which you have so nobly perfected."
