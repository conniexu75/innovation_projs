https://openalex.org/W2074117827,"Among the numerous types of architecture being explored for quantum computers are systems utilizing ion traps, in which quantum bits (qubits) are formed from the electronic states of trapped ions and coupled through the Coulomb interaction. Although the elementary requirements for quantum computation have been demonstrated in this system, there exist theoretical and technical obstacles to scaling up the approach to large numbers of qubits. Therefore, recent efforts have been concentrated on using quantum communication to link a number of small ion-trap quantum systems. Developing the array-based approach, we show how to achieve massively parallel gate operation in a large-scale quantum computer, based on techniques already demonstrated for manipulating small quantum registers. The use of decoherence-free subspaces significantly reduces decoherence during ion transport, and removes the requirement of clock synchronization between the interaction regions."
https://openalex.org/W2101161126,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive cancer susceptibility disorder characterized by cellular hypersensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC). Six FA genes have been cloned, but the gene or genes corresponding to FA subtypes B and D1 remain unidentified. Here we show that cell lines derived from FA-B and FA-D1 patients have biallelic mutations in BRCA2 and express truncated BRCA2 proteins. Functional complementation of FA-D1 fibroblasts with wild-type BRCA2 complementary DNA restores MMC resistance. Our results link the six cloned FA genes with BRCA1 and BRCA2 in a common pathway. Germ-line mutation of genes in this pathway may result in cancer risks similar to those observed in families with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2079927857,"We have developed a simple technique for the fabrication of polymer nanotubes with a monodisperse size distribution and uniform orientation. When either a polymer melt or solution is placed on a substrate with high surface energy, it will spread to form a thin film, known as a precursor film, similar to the behavior of low molar mass liquids ([1][1], [2][2]).

Similar wetting phenomena occur if porous templates are brought into contact with polymer solutions or melts: A thin surface film will cover the pore walls in the initial stages of wetting. This is because the cohesive driving forces for complete filling are much weaker than the adhesive forces. Wall wetting and complete filling of the pores thus take place on different time scales. The latter is prevented by thermal quenching in the case of melts or by solvent evaporation in the case of solutions, thus preserving a nanotube structure. If the template is of monodisperse size distribution, aligned or ordered, so are the nanotubes, and ordered polymer nanotube arrays can be obtained if the template is removed. Any melt-processible polymer, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), blends, or multicomponent solutions can be formed into nanotubes with a wall thickness of a few tens of nanometers. Owing to its versatility, this approach should be a promising route toward functionalized polymer nanotubes.

We used ordered porous alumina and oxidized macroporous silicon templates with narrow pore size distribution ([3][3]). Extended regular pore arrays were prepared by lithography. The pores are well-defined, straight, with a smooth inner surface and with diameters DP between 300 and 900 nm. To process melts, we placed the polymer on a pore array at a temperature well above its glass transition temperature, in the case of amorphous polymers, or its melting point, in the case of partially crystalline polymers. The liquid polymer forms a thin wetting film covering the entire pore surface on a time scale ranging from a few minutes to half an hour. Polymer solutions were dropped on the templates at ambient conditions (fig. S1A) ([4][4]). The resulting nanotubes obtained from either method had wall thicknesses between 20 and 50 nm and lengths of up to 100 μm. Oligomers as well as polymers with molecular masses Mn up to several hundreds of thousands of grams per mol were processed. [Figure 1][5]depicts nanotubes formed from several polymers by melt-wetting. The tip of a polystyrene (PS) nanotube ( Mn ∼ 850,000 g/mol) formed in an alumina template was uncovered by etching the alumina substrate with aqueous potassium hydroxide ([Fig. 1][5]A) ([4][4]). [Figure 1][5]B shows the same sample after the complete removal of the template. [Figure 1][5]C depicts an array of aligned PTFE nanotubes obtained by wetting an alumina template and [Fig. 1][5]D a highly ordered array of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA; Mn ∼ 80,000 g/mol) nanotubes prepared by wetting a macroporous silicon template. After selectively dissolving the template, the remaining nanotube array still exhibits its hexagonal long-range order.

( C ) Array of aligned PTFE tubes. ( D ) PMMA tubes with long-range hexagonal order obtained by wetting of a macroporous silicon pore array after complete removal of the template.



The wetting technique can be easily extended to prepare functionalized nanotubes, for example, palladium/polymer composite nanotubes. We first wetted the porous templates with a solution containing poly-l-lactide (PLLA) and palladium(II)acetate under ambient conditions. After evaporation of the solvent dichloromethane, a PLLA/palladium(II)acetate film covered the pore walls. The template was subsequently annealed in vacuum at temperatures of up to 300°C to degrade PLLA ([5][7]) and to reduce Pd. In a second wetting step, molten PS was added, so that Pd/PS composite tubes were formed (fig. S1B). Energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis verified the presence of Pd (fig. S1C), and selected area electron diffraction of single composite tubes revealed that it was metallic with a typical crystallite size of 2 to 3 nm (fig. S1D). As demonstrated by this example, template-wetting should have an outstanding potential in providing customized nanotubes for a broad range of applications in nanoscience.

https://openalex.org/W2011910303,"Villin, an actin bundling protein found in the apical brush border of absorptive tissues, is one of the first structural genes to be transcriptionally activated in the embryonic intestinal endoderm. In the adult, villin is broadly expressed in every cell of the intestinal epithelium on both the vertical axis (crypt to villus tip) and the horizontal axis (duodenum through colon) of the intestine. Here, we document that a 12.4-kilobase region of the mouse villin gene drives high level expression of two different reporter genes (LacZ and Cre recombinase) within the entire intestinal epithelium of transgenic mice. Deletion of a portion of this transgene results in reduction of β-galactosidase activity in restricted domains of the small intestine (duodenum) and large intestine (cecum). In addition, expression is reduced in the crypt compartment throughout the intestine. Thus, the global expression pattern of villin in the intestine is apparently the consequence of an amalgam of distinct and individual domain-specific control processes. That is, expression of villin in the duodenum and cecum requires different regulatory sequences than the rest of the intestine, and the expression of villin in crypts is regulated by different circuitry than expression of villin on villus tips.

For example, the study of globin gene expression provided important insights into red cell development (1Bieker J.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Orkin S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas the study of albumin expression led to an improved understanding of the factors that regulate development of the liver (3Zaret K.S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similarly, we propose that the actin bundling protein, villin, is an excellent model gene for the study of intestinal epithelial organogenesis. The villin gene is first activated at 9.0 days post coitum (dpc)1 in the presumptive intestinal hindgut endoderm during gut tube closure (4Braunstein E.M. Qiao X.T. Madison B. Pinson K. Dunbar L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 5Ezzell R.M. Chafel M.M. Matsudaira P.T. Development. 1989; 106: 407-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Maunoury R. Robine S. Pringault E. Leonard N. Gaillard J.A. Louvard D. Development. 1992; 115: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The early (10 dpc) expression domain of villin rapidly extends throughout the small and large intestinal endoderm and includes the distal stomach (4Braunstein E.M. Qiao X.T. Madison B. Pinson K. Dunbar L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,6Maunoury R. Robine S. Pringault E. Leonard N. Gaillard J.A. Louvard D. Development. 1992; 115: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 14–15 dpc, when the intestinal epithelium is dramatically remodeled and villi are formed, villin gene expression is up-regulated (6Maunoury R. Robine S. Pringault E. Leonard N. Gaillard J.A. Louvard D. Development. 1992; 115: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Maunoury R. Robine S. Pringault E. Huet C. Guenet J.L. Gaillard J.A. Louvard D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3321-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At 16 dpc, a sharp, one-cell-thick border of villin expression becomes apparent in the pyloric epithelium; intestinal cells express villin at high levels whereas neighboring stomach cells exhibit low or barely detectable expression of villin (4Braunstein E.M. Qiao X.T. Madison B. Pinson K. Dunbar L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Once intestinal crypts are established, villin is expressed in all cells of the crypt-villus axis, with an increasing gradient from crypt to tip (6Maunoury R. Robine S. Pringault E. Leonard N. Gaillard J.A. Louvard D. Development. 1992; 115: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the villin gene appears to respond to the various morphogenetic cues that dictate key events of intestinal development at multiple time points bothin utero and postnatally. It is therefore likely that the molecular factors that dictate this pattern of villin expression are the same factors that coordinate these key events of intestinal development. Villin regulatory sequences have been investigated in two previous studies (8Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F., El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Robine S. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Louvard D. Pringault E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11426-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the in vivo transcriptional start site of villin was initially erroneously mapped to the same exon as the translational start codon (9Robine S. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Louvard D. Pringault E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11426-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an early cell culture study analyzed a villin “promoter” fragment that actually consisted entirely of intronic sequences (9Robine S. Sahuquillo-Merino C. Louvard D. Pringault E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11426-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later work showed that transcription actually begins at a 5′ non-translated exon that is separated from exon 1 (the ATG-containing exon) by 5.6 kb in the mouse (8Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F., El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Pinson K.I. Dunbar L. Samuelson L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A 9-kb fragment, containing this entire intron plus 3.4 kb of additional upstream 5′-flanking sequence, was recently used to generate transgenic mice (8Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F., El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This 9-kb fragment drove reporter gene expression in the intestine of adult mice, although four of five founders showed “heterogeneous” expression. Because this analysis was limited to the study of founders, embryonic expression of the transgene was not investigated and the possible effects of transgene mosaicismversus position effects were not assessed (8Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F., El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here, we utilized a larger transgene construct and analyzed both fetal and adult transgene expression in multiple established lines. We report that a 12.4-kb region from the mouse villin gene directs intestine-specific expression of the bacterial β-galactosidase gene in a manner that largely recapitulates the normal expression pattern of villin in the intestine. In 75% of the established lines, including two single copy lines, this transgene directs continuous (not variegated) expression in the entire intestinal epithelium. This suggests that this 12.4-kb transgene contains a locus control region (LCR), a chromatin-remodeling cis element that facilitates position-independent expression (11Dillon N. Grosveld F. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 134-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 12Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 13Festenstein R. Tolaini M. Corbella P. Mamalaki C. Parrington J. Fox M. Miliou A. Jones M. Kioussis D. Science. 1996; 271: 1123-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 14Reitman M. Lee E. Westphal H. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1990; 348: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Su Y. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7902-7909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that this 12.4-kb regulatory fragment can be used to direct expression of Cre recombinase in the large and small intestines of transgenic mice. Analysis of a deletion derivative of this 12.4-kb regulatory fragment revealed the presence of one or more multifunctional enhancers within a 4.2-kb region of the first intron. This enhancer region appears to be at least partially responsible for mediating LCR-like activity and is necessary for high level expression of β-galactosidase in specific regions of the intestine, including the duodenum and cecum. In addition, the same 4.2-kb fragment is important for transgene expression in nascent and developed crypts along the entire cephalocaudal axis of the intestine. Together, these observations indicate that the continuous expression of villin throughout the small and large intestinal epithelium is due to the sum of individualcis elements that confer transcriptional activity to discrete domains along the cephalocaudal axis and crypt-villus axis of the intestine. The 12.4-kb promoter fragment from the villin gene was isolated from cosmid clones kindly provided by Dr. Philippe Gros, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. After digestion with EcoRI (6.7 kb 5′ of the transcriptional start site) and XmaI (in exon 1), a 12.4-kb promoter fragment was isolated and ligated into EcoRI andXmaI sites of the pBluescript II SK+ (pBSII SK+) plasmid (Stratagene) to create the plasmid pBSII-12.4kbVill. A deletion in intron 1 of this fragment was generated by digestion of the pBSII-12.4kbVill plasmid with NheI followed by re-ligation of the plasmid to create the plasmid pBSII-ΔNheVill. The LacZ coding region was removed from the pCH110 vector (CLONTECH) by digestion with KpnI andEcoRI and ligated into a modified pGEM7 vector (Promega) in which the XbaI site was replaced with a XmaI site. The LacZ insert was removed from this vector by digestion withXmaI and ligated into XmaI sites in pBSII-12.4kbVill and pBSII-ΔNheVill plasmids. This created the pBSII-12.4KbVilLacZ and pBSII-ΔNheVilLacZ plasmids. In both final plasmids, the β-galactosidase protein (with the first 39 amino acids removed) is fused to the first 18 amino acids of the villin protein. To make the pBSII-12.4kbVill plasmid a more useful tool for expression of any suitable cDNA (including Cre recombinase), the villin ATG and first 18 amino acids were removed. A 2.0-kb region of the villin intron was amplified using a forward primer specific for sequences flanking a unique BamHI site and a reverse primer specific for the first 11 bp of exon 1. The reverse primer in exon 1 excluded the villin ATG and contained a linker with restriction sites forSmaI, EcoRI, EcoRV, andNotI. The fragment was then cloned into the pBSII-12.4kbVill plasmid at the BamHI and NotI sites, creating the pBSII-12.4kbVill/ΔATG plasmid. A Cre recombinase cDNA with a metallothionein poly(A) signal was isolated as aXhoI/HindIII fragment from the pBS185 plasmid (Invitrogen) and cloned into pBS (Invitrogen) to create the pBS-Cre plasmid. A SalI/NotI fragment from the pBSII-12.4kbVill/ΔATG plasmid was cloned into theSalI/NotI sites of the pBS-Cre plasmid to create the pBS-12.4KbVilCre plasmid. All engineered regions were sequenced to ensure fidelity. DNA fragments containing villin regulatory sequences linked to LacZ were prepared by digestion of pBSII-12.4KbVilLacZ and pBSII-ΔNheVilLacZ plasmids withEcoRI and XhoI. The 12.4KbVilCre transgene construct was liberated from the pBS-VillinCre vector sequences usingKpnI. After purification, transgene DNA was injected into the pronuclei of fertilized ova (C57BL/6J x SJL/J) by the University of Michigan Transgenic Animal Core. Founders were identified by PCR amplification of tail DNA with specific primers for each transgene: 5′-TGCACTGGCCTAAAGCTCAC-3′ and 5′-CGACAGTATCGGCCTCAGG-3′ for the 12.4KbVilLacZ transgene; 5′-TGGAACTAAAACCCACGG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTACACAGCCCAGCACT-3′ for the ΔNheVilLacZ transgene; 5′-GTGTGGGACAGAGAACAAACCG-3′ and 5′-TGCGAACCTCATCACTCGTTGC-3′ for the 12.4KbVilCre transgene. Founders were mated to C57BL/6 mice to obtain F1 progeny for analysis of transgene expression. Embryos were obtained by mating these F1 mice to C57BL/6 mice. Embryos were staged by standard criteria (16Downs K.M. Davies T. Development. 1993; 118: 1255-1266PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kaufman M.H. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press, London1994: 95-248Google Scholar), and a small piece of tissue (tail, yolk sac, or liver) was removed for genotyping by PCR using the primers described above. Dissected embryos or tissues were fixed on ice for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 1.25 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS), then washed twice in PBS and placed in X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside) staining solution (1 mg/ml X-gal in N, N-dimethylformamide, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6-3H2O, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm MgCl2in PBS) for 2–10 h at 37 °C, depending on tissue size and embryo stage. Stained tissues were washed twice in PBS, post-fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 0.2% glutaraldehyde (1.25 mmEGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS), washed again in PBS, and further fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C. Tissues were stored in 70% ethanol after partial dehydration in a graded ethanol series (30%, 50%, and 70%, 5 min each). Whole mount photographs were taken at this point on a Zeiss inverted dissecting microscope. Intestinal tissue was dissected and washed with 0.02% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS 10 min at 4 °C, fixed 10 min on ice in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 1.25 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS, embedded in OCT (TissueTek), and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue blocks were warmed to −20 °C, and 8-μm sections were generated on a Microm HM 500M cryostat, dried for 5 min at 25 °C, and placed in ice-cold 1× PBS. As previously described (4Braunstein E.M. Qiao X.T. Madison B. Pinson K. Dunbar L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), sections were stained with X-gal for 2–14 h, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and coverslipped. Slides were analyzed, and digital images were captured using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. For quantitative analysis of β-galactosidase activity, protein extracts were made from tissue of F1 transgenic mice. Tissues were dissected, washed for 10 min with 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4 °C with agitation, washed with ice-cold PBS, then homogenized on ice in 6 volumes of homogenization buffer (PBS containing 40 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.13 mg/ml benzamidine, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml E64) per milligram of tissue. Protein concentrations were determined in triplicate by the Lowry method using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit. β-Galactosidase assays were performed in triplicate with 10–75 μg of total protein tissue extracts by diluting with reaction buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2) containing 0.88 mg/mlO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) to a total volume of 300 μl. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 or 50 min (for kidney and yolk sac extracts), and reactions were stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of 1 mNa2CO3. Samples were then read on a spectrophotometer for absorbance at 420 nm. Genomic DNA (6–8 μg) isolated from tails or liver was digested withKpnI and NheI restriction enzymes and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.25% agarose gel. Gels were blotted overnight to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were cross-linked by exposing to 1200 μJ of UV radiation in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) and prehybridized for at least 1 h at 60 °C with 10 ml (per 200 cm2 of membrane) of ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) supplemented with 150 μg/ml single-stranded sheared salmon sperm DNA. The Southern blot probe was prepared by PCR amplification of a region in intron 1 (between +5258 and +5614, in reference to start site of +1) using specific primers: 5′-CCAATGGAGGGTTCTTTTTGTG-3′ and 5′-AAACTGGCTTCCTATGGGGGTC-3′. Labeled probe was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, quick-cooled on ice, diluted to 2 × 106 cpm/ml with ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) supplemented with 150 μg/ml single-stranded sheared salmon sperm, and added to membranes (10 ml per 200 cm2 of membrane). Hybridization was carried out for 14–16 h at 60 °C. Band intensity was assessed on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated from tissues using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and concentrations were determined using a spectrophotometer. One microgram of total RNA was used for reverse transcriptase (RT)-mediated synthesis of cDNA using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) and 1 ng of random hexamer primers. To assess the RT reaction and quality of synthesized cDNA, PCR amplification of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase cDNA was performed using the specific primers: forward 5′-CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3′. Primers for the transgene mRNA were designed to flank the villin transgenic intron 1 with the forward primer located in exon 1 (5′-GATCTCCCAGGTGGTGGCTGCCTCTTCC-3′) and the backward primer located in the coding region of LacZ (5′-TCACTCCAACGCAGCACCATCACCG-3′). These primers amplify the same 744-bp fragment from both transgenes. PCR amplification was performed in a thermocycler for 35 cycles with 30-s cycles of denaturation at 94 °C and 45 s of polymerase extension at 72 °C. Annealing temperatures were performed as follows: for the first five cycles the annealing step was programmed at 68 °C for 30 s followed by 10 cycles in which the temperature was lowered 1 °C each cycle. The final 20 cycles were performed at an annealing temperature of 58 °C. Genomic fragments from the promoter region of the mouse villin gene were cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL2-Basic (Promega) and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation into the human intestine-like cell line CaCo2 or Rat2 fibroblasts. Luciferase vectors (5 μg) were co-transfected with 1 μg of a pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested for the luciferase assay (Promega) and relative activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, the villin gene locus contains a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) that is separated from the first coding exon by a 5.6-kb intron. The constructs used in these transfection experiments are shown in Fig. 1B, whereas luciferase assay results (normalized by co-transfected β-galactosidase activity) are shown in Fig. 1C. A construct containing 1236 bp of 5′-flanking sequence (−1 to −1236 from the transcriptional start site) reliably directs luciferase expression at high levels in CaCo2 cells, and at 5- to 6-fold lower levels in Rat2 fibroblasts (−1236, Fig. 1C). Removal of the 5′-most 682 bp significantly reduces transcriptional activity in both cell types (−554, Fig. 1, B and C). Removal of an additional 88 bp (−466) results in a further 2-fold reduction of reporter activity in CaCo2 cells. Thus, critical activating sequences appear to lie between −1236 and −554 bp, as well as between −554 and −466 bp. This confirms and refines earlier studies indicating the presence of activators between −3.5 kb and −480 bp and between −480 and −100bp of the mouse villin gene (8Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F., El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Addition of the 5.6-kb first intron to the −554 construct enhances promoter activity nearly 4-fold in CaCo2 cells, whereas promoter activity is unchanged in Rat2 fibroblasts (compare −544 to −554/intron, Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, Pinto et al. (8Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F., El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) also tested the effect of adding this intron and noted a 2-fold enhancement when the intron was linked to 3.5 kb of upstream sequence but no effect (or slight diminution) when the intron was linked to −480 bp of upstream sequence. Together, the data from the two studies indicate that elements within the first intron may interact with or synergize with 5′-flanking sequences between −480 and −544 bp. Deletion of a 4.2-kb region between two NheI sites in intron 1 results in a 2-fold reduction in reporter activity in CaCo2 cells, compared with the construct containing the entire intron (−554/ΔNhe, Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, this deletion increases expression in Rat2 fibroblasts by more than 4-fold. Thus, enhancer sequences within this 4.2-kb region appear to facilitate expression in intestinal-like cells while repressing expression in non-intestinal cells. To further explore the in vivo function of the putative intestinal cell-type-specific enhancer in intron 1 of the villin gene, two transgene constructs were prepared in which villin regulatory sequences were linked to a β-galactosidase reporter. Because earlier work (8Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F., El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) had shown that a transgene construct encompassing 9 kb of the mouse villin gene, including the first intron, was not sufficient to impart position-independent expression, we began with a larger segment of 5′ sequence. A transgene construct, 12.4KbVilLacZ, was prepared containing 6.7 kb of sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site, the untranslated exon (exon −1), the entire first intron, and the first 65 base pairs of exon 1, fused in-frame to the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (Fig.2A). A second transgene construct, ΔNheVilLacZ, was also generated, in which the same 5′-flanking sequences were included, but the 4.2-kb region of intron 1 containing the putative intronic enhancer identified in cell culture studies was deleted (Fig. 2A). Eight founders carrying the 12.4KbVilLacZ transgene and five founders carrying the ΔNheVilLacZ transgene were bred to obtain transgenic lines for analysis. At 4 to 8 weeks of age, tissues from F1 mice obtained from founders crossed to C57BL/6 mice were analyzed for β-galactosidase expression by staining with X-gal. Tissues analyzed included small intestine, colon, kidney, heart, lung, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, stomach, thymus, thyroid, brain, uterus, ovaries, and testes. In all eight lines of mice carrying the 12.4KbVilLacZ construct, β-galactosidase activity was detectable exclusively in the small intestine and colon. In most lines, the highest intensity of β-galactosidase staining was seen in the duodenum with progressively diminished staining in the ileum and colon (Fig. 2B), a gradient pattern that was confirmed by a quantitative β-galactosidase enzymatic solution assay (data not shown). In one very highly expressing line (Fig. 2C), β-galactosidase activity was similar along the entire horizontal axis of the intestine. The decreasing gradient of villin expression seen in most lines mimics the expression pattern of villin in the small intestine and colon seen in genetically modified mice in which a β-galactosidase cDNA was inserted into the endogenous villin locus (10Pinson K.I. Dunbar L. Samuelson L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, the 12.4-kb regulatory fragment contains the necessary cis sequences for the cephalocaudal expression pattern of villin in the intestine. The pyloric border of β-galactosidase expression was also appropriately abrupt. No expression of the reporter was observed in stomach, but adjacent intestinal cells were intensely stained (Fig. 2, Gand H). In six of eight lines, including two lines that contained a single copy of the transgene (see below), β-galactosidase expression was continuous throughout the small and large intestine, showing no evidence of mottled or variegated expression (Fig. 2, B andC). In the intestine, position effect variegation is expected to cause mottled expression in the adult, because crypts are monoclonal (18Roth K.A. Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Stochastic silencing of the transgene in some crypts and activation in others would result in an all or none expression pattern with some crypts being totally β-galactosidase-positive and others β-galactosidase-negative. This type of patchy expression pattern was observed in two of the eight lines studied; both were high copy number lines (see below). The fact that only 25% of 12.4KbVilLacZ lines showed evidence of patchy expression while 80% of founders carrying a transgene driven by a 9-kb villin fragment (8Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F., El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) exhibited this pattern suggests that the extra 3.4 kb of 5′-flanking sequence used here are important for suppression of chromosomal position effects. The expression of β-galactosidase was also analyzed in 4- to 8-week-old ΔNheVilLacZ transgenic mice. Highly variegated expression was seen in the intestine in two of five lines (N3, N5), whereas two lines (N1, N4) showed no expression at all in any tissue, including the intestine. One line (N2), exhibited non-variegated expression, except in the duodenum just distal to the stomach (Fig. 2D, asterisk), where expression was both reduced and variegated. The lack of expression in some ΔNheVilLacZ lines and variegated expression in others suggests that this transgene is susceptible to position effect silencing. This is in dramatic contrast to the 12.4KbVilLacZ transgenic mice in which variegated expression was only observed in two out of eight lines. Thus, the deleted 4.2-kb region of intron 1 may contain sequences important for LCR-like activity. Strikingly, in all three ΔNheVilLacZ lines that expressed β-galactosidase, expression was most severely reduced in the proximal duodenum (Fig. 2, D–F, asterisks). This indicates that, in addition to possible LCR-like function, the 4.2-kb region of intron 1 is also required for region-specific expression in the duodenum. Close examination of the pyloric region in 12.4KbVilLacZ (Fig. 2, G and H) and in ΔNheVilLacZ mice (Fig.2I) shows that sequences important for the establishment of the discrete epithelial border between stomach and intestine are present in both constructs. Expression was not detected in the stomach in any of the ΔNheVilLacZ lines or the 12.4KbVilLacZ lines. β-Galactosidase activity was evaluated at 10.5, 12.5, and 14.5 dpc in multiple F2 embryos representing three separate lines for each transgene. In both groups of transgenic mice, expression was first detectable in the embryonic midgut and hindgut at 12.5 dpc (data not shown). This is 3 days later than that observed in the LacZ knock-in model (4Braunstein E.M. Qiao X.T. Madison B. Pinson K. Dunbar L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and indicates that some critical sequences necessary for transgene activation at the proper time are missing from both constructs. For 12.4KbVilLacZ transgenic mice, embryonic expression was restricted to the midgut and hindgut with expression decreasing distally along the axis of the hindgut (Fig.3A), identical to the embryonic expression pattern seen in the Villin LacZ knock-in model (4Braunstein E.M. Qiao X.T. Madison B. Pinson K. Dunbar L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the further developmentally programmed postnatal up-regulation of β-galactosidase (concomitant with endogenous villin up-regulation) apparently causes this gradient to disappear in adults of this particular line; in other transgenic lines the gradient is still visible in the adult (Fig. 2, B versus C). In ΔNhe embryos, however, expression was consistently diminished in the presumptive proximal duodenal area just distal to the stomach (Fig.3B, asterisk). Thus, in both embryos and adults carrying the ΔNhe transgene, β-galactosidase expression is reduced in the duodenum. Also apparent in Fig. 3B is the loss of β-galactosidase staining in the presumptive cecum of ΔNhe mice. Like the reduction in duodenal staining, this is a reproducible finding, seen in three independent ΔNhe lines. However, unlike the duodenal pattern, where reduced staining persisted into adulthood, cecal exp"

These enzymes share sequence similarity with the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death protease CED-3 and are synthesized as inactive precursor forms that must be proteolytically cleaved in order to be activated (1Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). Initiator pro-caspases 2, 8, 9, and 10 are activated with the help of adaptor molecules that bring these proteases into close proximity, permitting autoprocessing (2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc.

MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). With the exception of caspase-2, initiator caspases are responsible for cleaving and activating effector pro-caspases 3, 6, and 7. Effector caspases, in turn, cleave various proteins leading to morphological and biochemical features characteristic of apoptosis (5Robertson J.D. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become abundantly clear that caspase-9 activity is required for apoptosis induced by different stimuli (6Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Specifically, damage to mitochondria results in the release of cytochrome c, which together with Apaf-1 and dATP lead to the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-9 (7Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar, 8Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). Among the cytotoxic stimuli that can initiate the mitochondrial pathway is the chemotherapeutic drug and topoisomerase II poison etoposide (9Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). Normally, topoisomerase II prevents intertwining of DNA by generating transient double-stranded breaks through which an intact helix can pass (10Kaufmann S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Etoposide was designed to exploit selectively the catalytic property of topoisomerase II by increasing the number and duration of DNA cleavage sites, resulting ultimately in permanent double-stranded breaks that are lethal to the cell (11Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). For several years, it was argued that cytochrome c release induced by etoposide was a caspase-independent event and that caspase-9, in general, was the most apical caspase in chemical-induced apoptosis (9Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar, 12Sun X.-M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4241) Google Scholar). However, we recently demonstrated that etoposide-induced cytochrome crelease involves distinct dose- and caspase-dependent pathways (14Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In particular, a low dose (10 μm) of etoposide appears to exert its effect at the nuclear level, resulting in the release of a heat-labile factor(s) that, in turn, interacts with mitochondria to elicit cytochrome c release. Because this effect was inhibited by the general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk),1 and caspase-2 was the earliest caspase activated in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, we speculated that the release of cytochrome c triggered by a low dose of etoposide may require active caspase-2. Two mRNA alternative splicing variants encode two caspase-2 proteins, caspase-2L and caspase-2S, with different effects on apoptotic cell death (15Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 16Droin N. Rebe C. Bichat F. Hammann A. Bertrand R. Solary E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic protein caspase-2L (referred to here as caspase-2) is the prevailing isoform expressed in most tissues (15Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation studies have revealed that pro-caspase-2 is present in several intracellular compartments, including the mitochondrion, Golgi, cytosol, and nucleus (17Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is the only pro-caspase present constitutively in the nucleus. Interestingly, neurons from caspase-2 knock-out mice are actually more sensitive to death than neurons from wild-type mice, whereas caspase-2-deficient oocytes or lymphoblasts from the same animals are resistant to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs or granzyme B and perforin, respectively (19Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A., Li, E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The aim of the current study was to identify a role for caspase-2 in etoposide-induced apoptosis. The results indicate a decreased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by 10 μmetoposide in cells with impaired caspase-2 activity. The level of inhibition precedes the engagement of mitochondria, because cytochromec release was inhibited. Moreover, cells treated with benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VDVAD-fmk) or stably transfected with pro-caspase-2 antisense (Casp-2/AS) exhibited significantly lower levels of phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the plasma membrane, as well as reduced caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities. In addition, reconstituted cell-free experiments revealed that etoposide-induced cytochromec release from liver mitochondria was reduced when these organelles were incubated with nuclei isolated fromCasp-2/AS- versus neo-transfected cells. Combined, we propose that nuclear caspase-2 is an important upstream promoter of mitochondrial cytochrome c release in response to etoposide. Wild-type Jurkat T-lymphocytes or cells stably transfected with pro-caspase-2 antisense (Casp-2/AS) or control vector (neo) were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2% (w/v) glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were maintained in a logarithmic growth phase for all experiments. Apoptosis was induced with etoposide (10 μm) (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.), and ethanol (0.03% final concentration) was used as a vehicle control. In some cases, cells were first treated for 1 h with z-VAD-fmk, z-VDVAD-fmk, or z-LEHD-fmk (25 μm) (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA) to inhibit caspase activity and Me2SO (0.2% final concentration) was used as a vehicle control. Cells were collected and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in S-100 buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C and used for cell-free experiments or Western blot analysis. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and recovered at 500 × g for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 320 mm sucrose, 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) at a concentration of 4 × 107/ml. Cells were gently lysed by homogenization with a tight fitting pestle in a Dounce homogenizer, and plasma membrane rupture was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. The resulting homogenate was diluted with 2 volumes of buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.0 m sucrose, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT) and transferred to centrifuge tubes. Prior to centrifugation, 3–5 ml of buffer B were added as a cushion to the bottom of the tube. Samples were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the resulting nuclei were resuspended in storage buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol) at a final concentration of 200,000 nuclei/μl. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C until used. The liver of a male Sprague-Dawley rat was minced on ice, resuspended in 50 ml of MSH buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, and homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer and Teflon pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and recentrifuged at 5500 ×g for 15 min to form a mitochondrial pellet that was resuspended in MSH buffer without EDTA and centrifuged again at 5500 × g for 15 min. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in MSH buffer at a protein concentration of 80–100 mg/ml. Fresh mitochondria were prepared for each experiment and used within 4 h. Phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was detected using the Annexin V:FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit II (BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 5 × 105 cells were pelleted following drug treatment and washed in PBS. Next, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. Prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, 400 μl of binding buffer were added to the cells. Necrotic cells were excluded by gating before histogram analysis and never accounted for more than 4% of total cells. Analysis of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was performed as described previously (20Jiang S. Zhivotovsky B. Burgess D.H. Gahm A. Chow S.C. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 250 μl of TE buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Subsequently, the suspension was mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (20 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C to separate intact chromatin (pellet) from DNA fragments (supernatant). The supernatant containing fragmented DNA was precipitated with ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Precipitated and lyophilized DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer and incubated with 1 μl of 50 mg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 1 μl of 25 mg/ml proteinase K. The samples were mixed at 1:5 ratio with loading buffer (40% sucrose, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed at 60 mA on 1.8% agarose gels. Separated DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light. Standard reactions were carried out in a 35-μl reaction volume with reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm succinate, 2 mmATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) in the absence or presence of Jurkat nuclei (106), isolated liver mitochondria (15 μg of protein), and 25 μg of wild-type Jurkat cytosol protein. Nuclei and mitochondria were suspended separately in reaction buffer prior to their addition to the reaction mix. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for up to 2 h. Nuclei and mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −20 °C until used for Western blot analysis. Samples were mixed with Laemmli's loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE at 130 V followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose for 2 h at 100 V. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and subsequently probed overnight with an anti-cytochrome c (1:2500) (BD PharMingen), anti-caspase-2L (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Smac/DIABLO (1:500) (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), anti-AIF (1:1000), or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:3000) (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) antibody. The membranes were rinsed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000). Following the secondary antibody incubation, the membranes were rinsed, and bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. The measurement of DEVD-AMC, VDVAD-AMC, or LEHD-AMC (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) cleavage was performed using a modified version of a fluorometric assay reported previously (21Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar). 500,000 cells were pelleted and washed once with ice-cold PBS. For DEVD-AMC cleavage, cells were resuspended in 25 μl of PBS, added to a microtiter plate, and combined with substrate dissolved in a standard reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.25, 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% CHAPS). For VDVAD-AMC or LEHD-AMC cleavage, cells were resuspended in 25 μl of PBS, added to a microtiter plate, and combined with substrate dissolved in a standard reaction buffer (100 mmMES, pH 6.5, 10% polyethylene glycol, 10 mm DTT, 0.1% CHAPS). Cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide substrates was monitored by AMC liberation in a Fluoroscan II plate reader (Labsystems, Stockholm, Sweden) using 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths. Fluorescence units were converted to pmol of AMC using a standard curve generated with free AMC. Data from duplicate samples were then analyzed by linear regression. Uncertainty persists as to how DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, such as etoposide, initiate apoptosis by invoking the mitochondrial pathway and eliciting cytochrome c release. We demonstrated previously that the stimulation of cytochrome c release by etoposide occurs by distinct pathways that hinge upon the concentration of drug being used (14Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Specifically, using wild-type Jurkat T-lymphocytes or a reconstituted cell-free system, cytochrome c release stimulated by a low (10 μm) dose of etoposide appeared to require caspase activity and possibly that of caspase-2. To build on our previous study and to evaluate the contribution of caspase-2 to apoptosis induced by 10 μm etoposide, we initially used the irreversible caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk. Using FITC-labeled annexin V and flow cytometric analysis, we observed that pretreatment of wild-type Jurkat cells with 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk for 1 h completely blocked etoposide-induced PS exposure on the plasma membrane at 6 h (Fig.1A). The level of PS exposure in cells treated with etoposide alone was ∼37% (Fig. 1A). PS exposure was also evaluated at 3 h, and no difference between control and etoposide-treated cells was observed (data not shown). Consistent with the PS exposure data, 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk effectively blocked DNA fragmentation as assessed by oligonucleosomal ladder formation (Fig. 1B, lane 3 versus 2). Together, these data provide evidence that caspase-2 is important for etoposide-induced apoptosis. A previous study reported the early activation of pro-caspase-2 in response to various stimuli. Activation occurred upstream of caspase-3 activity and thus suggested that pro-caspase-2 may act as an initiator caspase (22Harvey N.L. Butt A.J. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13134-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, the authors speculated that caspase-2 may be part of a signaling complex, similar to caspases 8 and 9, involved in transducing signals between death stimuli and downstream apoptotic events, although direct evidence to support this notion was not presented. To determine whether caspase-2 was important for etoposide-induced cytochrome c release, wild-type Jurkat cells were treated with 10 μm etoposide for 3 h in the absence or presence of 25 μm z-VAD-fmk or z-VDVAD-fmk (Fig.2). The results indicated that 10 μm etoposide stimulated processing of pro-caspase-2, yielding bands of ∼18 and 12 kDa in size (Fig.2A, lane 2). Pretreatment of cells with either z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2A, lane 3) or z-VDVAD-fmk (Fig.2A, lane 4) prevented this event. Processing of pro-caspase-2 was accompanied by the release of cytochrome cinto the cytosol (Fig. 2B, lane 2), an effect that was undermined, but not completely prevented, when cells were first incubated with either z-VAD-fmk (lane 3) or z- VDVAD-fmk (lane 4) for 1 h. The absence of total protection by either inhibitor may be explained by recent observations demonstrating a transcription-independent role for p53, where in response to DNA damage this protein localizes to mitochondria to stimulate cytochrome c release and changes in membrane potential (23Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Importantly, neither benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-DEVD-fmk) nor benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-LEHD-fmk), inhibitors of caspase-3-like (referred to here as caspase-3) and caspase-9 activities, respectively, was able to mimic the effect of z-VAD-fmk or z-VDVAD-fmk. Thus, it would appear that caspase-2 acts as an important upstream modulator of cytochrome c release in response to etoposide. Because caspase-2 inhibition attenuated cytochrome c release in response to etoposide, we conjectured that this would translate into reduced caspase-9 and -3 activities. To test this premise, caspase-2 (VDVADase), caspase-9 (LEHDase), and caspase-3 (DEVDase) activities were measured following treatment of wild-type Jurkat cells with 10 μm etoposide for up to 6 h (Fig.3). Consistent with our previous results (14Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), an increase in caspase-2 activity was detected prior to an increase in caspase-9 activity (Fig. 3, A and C). Complementary experiments performed with z- VDVAD-fmk or z-LEHD-fmk revealed that both pro-caspase-9 and -3 activation, stimulated by 10 μm etoposide, depend on active caspase-2 (Fig. 3, B and C). In other words, etoposide-induced caspase-9 and -3 activities were inhibited when cells were pretreated for 1 h with 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk. It should be noted that 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk prevented neither cytochromec release nor pro-caspases 9 or 3 activation in response to 50 μm etoposide, verifying the inability of z-VDVAD-fmk to inhibit these proteases directly. When cells were pretreated for 1 h with 25 μm z-LEHD-fmk, caspase-9 and -3 activities were inhibited (Fig. 3, B and C). Surprisingly, z-LEHD-fmk also partially inhibited caspase-2 activity (Fig. 3A); however, this may reflect a pool of pro-caspase-2 that is normally activated by caspase-3-mediated cleavage (24Li H. Bergeron L. Cryns V. Pasternack M.S. Zhu H. Shi L. Greenberg A. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21010-21017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the ordering of the proteolytic caspase cascade in response to a low dose of etoposide is as follows: caspase-2 → caspase-9 → caspase-3. To assess whether Jurkat cells with a decreased level of pro-caspase-2 were similarly resistant to etoposide-induced apoptosis as wild-type cells treated with 25 μmz-VDVAD-fmk, experiments were performed using neo- orCasp-2/AS-transfected cells described previously (Fig.4A) (25Droin N. Bichat F. Rebe C. Wotawa A. Sordet O. Hammann A. Bertrand R. Solary E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1835-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although that study demonstrated an apparent role for caspase-2 in Fas-mediated cell death, the authors also reported that down-regulation of pro-caspase-2 had no effect on etoposide-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation. It was speculated that this might be related to drug-induced transcriptional activation of Casp-2 (26Droin N. Dubrez L. Eymin B. Renvoize C. Breard J. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. Solary E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2885-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although this possibility cannot be excluded, we were interested in whether the lack of protection could be attributed to the concentration (50 μm) of etoposide employed, because we had demonstrated in our previous study that 50 μm etoposide was directly toxic to mitochondria and stimulated a caspase-independent release of cytochrome c as well as earlier and more robust DEVDase activity (14Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Here, neo- and Casp-2/AS-transfected cells were treated with 10 μm etoposide for up to 6 h and evaluated for any difference in apoptosis. Results indicated that both cell lines were sensitive to this concentration of etoposide as measured by PS exposure (Fig. 4, B and C). However, ∼43% of neo-transfected cells (Fig. 4B) were positive for annexin V binding, whereas only ∼28% of Casp-2/AS-transfected cells (Fig. 4C) exposed PS. The fact thatCasp-2/AS cells were not entirely resistant to 10 μm etoposide was not surprising because these cells maintain a certain level of pro-caspase-2, albeit considerably less than neo-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). It is worth mentioning that DNA fragmentation was also evaluated, and the results were consistent with those for PS exposure (data not shown). In either case, when neo or Casp-2/AS cells were pretreated with 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk for 1 h, PS exposure (Fig. 4, B and C) and DNA fragmentation were blocked. Because our inhibitor experiments (Fig. 3) revealed that pro-caspase-2 activation apparently occurs upstream of pro-caspases 9 and 3, the next step was to determine whether this ordering of pro-caspase activation was true in cells stably expressing pro-caspase-2 antisense. In other words, does an enforced lowering of pro-caspase-2 translate into reduced or delayed activation of pro-caspases 9 and 3 in response to 10 μm etoposide? To test this possibility, neo- and Casp-2/AS-transfected cells were treated with etoposide for up to 6 h, and fluorometric analysis of different caspase activities was performed (Fig. 5). In agreement with the data presented in Fig. 3, Casp-2/AScells exhibited lower levels of not only VDVADase but also DEVDase and LEHDase activities when compared with neo cells. In each case, increases in activity were observed earlier and were considerably more pronounced in neo-transfected cells (Fig. 5, A–C). In particular, by 6 h, neo cells exhibited an ∼500 and ∼1600% rise in VDVADase and DEVDase activities, respectively, whereas the rise of these activities in Casp-2/AS cells was more modest at ∼250 and ∼750%, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, pretreatment of either cell line with 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk for 1 h prior to etoposide completely abolished any increase in VDVADase, DEVDase, or LEHDase activity (Fig.5, A–C). Taken together, these data offer additional support for the notion that caspase-2 is the most apical caspase in etoposide-induced apoptosis. To extend these results a step further, we were interested in determining whether stable expression of pro-caspase-2 antisense would attenuate etoposide-induced cytochromec release to an extent similar to z-VDVAD-fmk or z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2B). Two different, albeit complementary, approaches were used to address this question. First, intact neo- orCasp-2/AS-transfected cells were treated with 10 μm etoposide for 3 or 6 h in the absence or presence of 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk, and cytosolic extracts were prepared for cytochrome c measurement. Second, experiments were performed using a reconstituted cell-free system wherein isolated neo or Casp-2/AS Jurkat nuclei (106), isolated liver mitochondria (15 μg of protein), and/or wild-type Jurkat cytosol (25 μg of protein) were treated with 10 μmetoposide for up to 2 h at 37 °C. Western blot analysis of cytosols isolated from neo- and Casp-2/AS-transfected cells at 3 h revealed that etoposide stimulated cytochrome c release in neo but notCasp-2/AS cells (Fig.6A, lane 2 versus 1 and lane 5 versus 4). Moreover, pretreatment of neo-transfected cells with 25 μmz-VDVAD-fmk attenuated cytochrome c release (Fig.6A, lane 3 versus 2), an effect that was consistent with results obtained earlier using wild-type Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B, lane 4 versus 2). Whether apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) or second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)-binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIABLO) was released at 3 h after etoposide treatment was also investigated. As seen in Fig. 6A, the release profile of Smac/DIABLO was similar to that observed for cytochrome c at 3 h (Fig.6A), which is consistent with a previous report documenting Smac/DIABLO release as a general feature of apoptosis in Jurkat cells (27Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In contrast, AIF was not released during etoposide-induced apoptosis. It should be noted that Western blot analysis of a subcellular fraction containing mitochondria demonstrated the reactivity of the anti-AIF antibody with human AIF (data not shown). It is also worth mentioning that preliminary data recently generated in our laboratory suggest that AIF is only released during mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, 2J. D. Robertson, M. Enoksson, M. Suomela, B. Zhivotovsky, and S. Orrenius, unpublished observations. which may account for the absence of its release in response to 10 μmetoposide. At 6 h after 10 μm etoposide treatment, neither z-VDVAD-fmk nor pro-caspase-2 antisense alone was able to mitigate cytochrome c release (Fig. 6B, lanes 3and 5). However, Casp-2/AS cells pretreated with 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk remained refractory to cytochromec release (Fig. 6B, lane 6 versus 5). Together, this suggests that pro-caspase-2 antisense significantly delays but does not altogether prevent cytochromec release induced by 10 μm etoposide. Importantly, these data are in agreement with our previous report demonstrating the inability of 25 μm z-VAD-fmk to prevent etoposide-induced cytochrome c release at 6 h, an effect attributed to the ability of a low dose (10 μm) of etoposide to ultimately target mitochondria directly (14Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Experiments performed using a cell-free system consisting of isolated Jurkat nuclei and liver mitochondria yielded results for cytochromec release that were consistent with the cytosolic extract data (Fig. 6, panel C versus A). Specifically, 10 μm etoposide stimulated cytochrome c release following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C when the reaction mixture contained nuclei isolated from neo-transfected cells (Fig.6C, lane 2 versus 1) but not whenCasp-2/AS nuclei were present (Fig. 6C, lane 5 versus 4). Interestingly, this effect was not altered by cytosolic factors, because etoposide-induced cytochromec release occurred to a similar extent when a fraction containing wild-type Jurkat cytosol was present (data not shown). Treating the reaction mixture with 25 μm z-VDVAD-fmk was sufficient to decrease cytochrome c release induced by etoposide (Fig. 6C, lane 3 versus 2). It should be mentioned that 10 μm etoposide did not stimulate cytochrome c release when mitochondria were incubated in the absence of nuclei. Together, these data implicate a role for the nuclear pool of pro-caspase-2 during etoposide-induced cytochrome c release. That pro-caspase-2 is activated in response to a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α, Fas ligand, growth factor withdrawal, and DNA-damaging agents, has been documented previously (22Harvey N.L. Butt A.J. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13134-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Droin N. Bichat F. Rebe C. Wotawa A. Sordet O. Hammann A. Bertrand R.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9204-9215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, assigning an emergent function to this protease during apoptosis has been difficult. This is due, in part, to the fact that despite its long pro-domain, which is characteristic of initiator caspases, caspase-2 has largely been assigned a downstream or feedback role because of the capacity for it to be cleaved by active caspase-3 (24Li H. Bergeron L. Cryns V. Pasternack M.S. Zhu H. Shi L. Greenberg A. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21010-21017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 29Slee E.A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Additionally, caspase-2 was reported to act as both a positive and negative regulator of cell death in caspase-2-deficient mice (19Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A., Li, E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Also, unlike initiator caspases 8 and 9, caspase-2 cannot cleave effector caspases directly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of caspase-2 in the apoptotic pathway triggered by the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. We have now demonstrated that apoptosis induced by 10 μmetoposide involves active caspase-2. Specifically, this protease is activated early within the pathway and acts upstream of mitochondria to regulate cytochrome c release both in intact Jurkat cells and in a reconstituted cell-free system. When etoposide-induced activation of pro-caspase-2 is subverted by z-VDVAD-fmk or stable transfection of pro-caspase-2 antisense, cytochrome crelease and other manifestations of apoptosis are attenuated. A previous report (30Paroni G. Henderson C. Schneider C. Brancolini C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21907-21915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) indicated that simply overexpressing caspase-2 was sufficient to induce the translocation of Bid from cytosol to mitochondria. The same study revealed that caspase-2 is able to cleave Bid in vitro, albeit weakly, suggesting that caspase-2 may invoke the mitochondrial pathway by processing this protein. However, in agreement with our earlier study, we did not observe Bid cleavage following etoposide treatment (data not shown). Moreover, the fact that a cytosolic fraction was not necessary for etoposide-induced cytochromec release in our cell-free system suggests that Bid is not required. We propose a model wherein etoposide treatment stimulates the activation of nuclear pro-caspase-2. Subsequently, active caspase-2 or, more likely, a cleaved substrate translocates out of the nucleus to target mitochondria and stimulate cytochrome c release (Fig.7). Coincidentally, during the preparation of this manuscript, two articles were published implicating caspase-2 as an effector of the mitochondrial pathway (31Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 32Paroni G. Henderson C. Schneider C. Brancolini C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15147-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, although those papers and the current study each uniquely demonstrates that pro-caspase-2 is activated upstream of pro-caspase-9, the mechanism responsible for its activation is unknown. Because it was previously suggested that activation of pro-caspase-2 involves an adaptor molecule known as caspase and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) adaptor with death domain/RIP-associated Ich-1-homologous protein with death domain (CRADD/RAIDD) that is present in the cytosol and the nucleus (33Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 34Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), one could envisage a scenario in which activation of pro-caspase-2 occurs in a manner similar to the activation of initiator pro-caspases 8 and 9. Specifically, it is intriguing to think that etoposide-induced activation of pro-caspase-2 might involve the formation of a nuclear signaling complex, wherein upon drug treatment CRADD/RAIDD gathers pro-caspase-2 molecules into close proximity to allow autoprocessing. However, additional studies are needed to characterize the mechanism of pro-caspase-2 activation as well as subsequent events leading to the engagement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

Here we show that ectopic expression of AID alone can induce hypermutation in an artificial GFP substrate in NIH 3T3 murine fibroblast cells. The frequency of mutations was closely correlated with the level of transcription of the target gene, and the distribution of mutations in NIH 3T3 cells was similar to those of SHM in B lymphocytes.

This depletion of calcium has been inferred from studies showing that sources of calcium in forest ecosystems namely, atmospheric deposition and mineral weathering of silicate rocks such as plagioclase, a calcium-sodium silicate do not match calcium outputs observed in forest streams. It is therefore thought that calcium is being lost from exchangeable and organically bound calcium in forest soils. Here we investigate the sources of calcium in the Hubbard Brook experimental forest, through analysis of calcium and strontium abundances and strontium isotope ratios within various soil, vegetation and hydrological pools. We show that the dissolution of apatite (calcium phosphate) represents a source of calcium that is comparable in size to known inputs from atmospheric sources and silicate weathering. Moreover, apatite-derived calcium was utilized largely by ectomycorrhizal tree species, suggesting that mycorrhizae may weather apatite and absorb the released ions directly, without the ions entering the exchangeable soil pool. Therefore, it seems that apatite weathering can compensate for some of the calcium lost from base-poor ecosystems, and should be considered when estimating soil acidification impacts and calcium cycling."

Here, we studied the involvement of AMPK and iPFK-2 in the stimulation of glycolysis in activated monocytes under hypoxia. iPFK-2 was phosphorylated on the homologous serine (Ser-461) and activated by AMPK in vitro. The activation of human monocytes by lipopolysaccharide induced iPFK-2 expression and increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content and glycolysis. The incubation of activated monocytes with oligomycin, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, or under hypoxic conditions activated AMPK and further increased iPFK-2 activity, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content, and glycolysis. In cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the expression of a dominant-negative AMPK prevented both the activation and phosphorylation of co-transfected iPFK-2 by oligomycin. It is concluded that the stimulation of glycolysis by hypoxia in activated monocytes requires the phosphorylation and activation of iPFK-2 by AMPK."
https://openalex.org/W2046964936,"The behavior of immature cortical networks in vivo remains largely unknown. Using multisite extracellular and patch-clamp recordings, we observed recurrent bursts of synchronized neuronal activity lasting 0.5 to 3 seconds that occurred spontaneously in the hippocampus of freely moving and anesthetized rat pups. The influence of slow rhythms (0.33 and 0.1 hertz) and the contribution of both gamma-aminobutyric acid A-mediated and glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic signals in the generation of hippocampal bursts was reminiscent of giant depolarizing potentials observed in vitro. This earliest pattern, which diversifies during the second postnatal week, could provide correlated activity for immature neurons and may underlie activity-dependent maturation of the hippocampal network."

A topotactic first-order transition between different but related crystal structures at room temperature takes place by an electrochemical redox process: MnP4 <--> Li7MnP4. The P-P bonds in the MnP4 structure are cleaved at the time of Li insertion (reduction) to produce crystalline Li7MnP4 and are reformed after reoxidation to MnP4, thereby acting as an electron storage reservoir. This is an unusual example of facile covalent bond breaking within the crystalline solid state that can be reversed by the input of electrochemical energy."

Morphotypes historically given the name Acropora prolifera are entirely F 1 hybrids of these two species, showing morphologies that depend on which species provides the egg for hybridization.

The hypoxia resistance was acutely inducible just before hypoxic exposure and was mediated through an AKT-1/PDK-1/forkhead transcription factor pathway overlapping with but distinct from signaling pathways regulating life-span and stress resistance.

The rupture length and maximum displacement are the largest among the co-seismic surface rupture zones reported on so far.

https://openalex.org/W1971354911,"The issue of whether the cerebellum contributes to motor skill learning is controversial, principally because of the difficulty of separating the effects of motor learning from changes in performance. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation during an implicit, motor sequence-learning task that was designed to separate these two processes. During the sequence-encoding phase, human participants performed a concurrent distractor task that served to suppress the performance changes associated with learning. Upon removal of the distractor, participants showed evidence of having learned. No cerebellar activation was associated with the learning phase, despite extensive involvement of other cortical and subcortical regions. There was, however, significant cerebellar activation during the expression of learning; thus, the cerebellum does not contribute to learning of the motor skill itself but is engaged primarily in the modification of performance."

A glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membranous protein, PH-20, which was originally identified as a binding protein to the ZP in guinea pig sperm (8Primakoff P. Hyatt H. Myles D.G. J.

Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When the enzyme activity of PH-20 is blocked, sperm are incapable of entering into the cumulus cell layer (14Lin Y. Mahan K. Lathrop W.F. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The binding of acrosome-reacted sperm to ZP, known as “secondary sperm-ZP binding,” is also inhibited by antibody against PH-20 (15Hunnicutt G.R. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, these results imply that PH-20 is bifunctional. The N- and C-terminal domains of PH-20 have been reported to be responsible for hyaluronidase and ZP binding activities, respectively (15Hunnicutt G.R. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To explore the role of PH-20 in vivo, using homologous recombination we have produced male mice carrying a disruptive mutation in the PH-20 gene. The mice lacking PH-20 are still fertile, providing evidence that PH-20 is not essential for the penetration of sperm through the cumulus cell layer. Moreover, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of hyaluronic acid demonstrates the existence of other hyaluronidase(s) except PH-20 in mouse sperm. In particular, a hyaluronic acid-hydrolyzing protein with a size of ∼55 kDa is abundantly present in soluble proteins released byA23187-induced acrosome reaction of sperm, including the acrosomal components. Thus, the process governing sperm penetration of the cumulus cell layer needs to be reassessed at least in the mouse model. Genomic clones encoding the PH-20 gene were isolated from a mouse 129/SvJ genomic DNA library in λFIXII (Stratagene) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified cDNA fragment as a probe. Of 10 clones isolated, two clones, termed mPHG3 and mPHG6, were used for construction of a targeting vector including a neomycin-resistance (neo) expression cassette flanked by a 1.5-kb genomic region of the PH-20 gene and an HSV-TK cassette (Fig.1A). The construct was designed to replace a part of exon 2 with the neo expression cassette. Following electroporation of the targeting construct, which had been linearized by digestion withNotI, into mouse D3 embryonic stem (ES) cells, homologous recombinants were selected using G418 and gancyclovir as described previously (16Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five ES cell clones containing the targeted mutation were selected from 504 clones resistant to G418 and gancyclovir and injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. Chimeric male mice were crossed to C57BL/6 or ICR females (Japan SLC Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) to establish heterozygous mutant lines. Homozygous null mice were obtained by heterozygous mating. Genomic DNA was prepared from mouse tail, digested by BglII, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Total cellular RNA was also separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto the nylon membranes. The blots were probed by 32P-labeled DNA fragments and analyzed by a BAS-1800II Bio-Image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo) as described previously (17Kashiwabara S. Zhuang T. Yamagata K. Noguchi J.

Rabbit anti-mouse PH-20 antibody was purified by fractionation with ammonium sulfate (0 to 40% saturation) followed by immunoaffinity chromatography on columns of Sepharose 4B that had been conjugated with recombinant polypeptides produced inEscherichia coli containing 313 and 165 amino acids at residues 36–348 and 348–512 in the N- and C-terminal regions of mouse PH-20, respectively. Fresh cauda epididymal sperm were collected in a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (TYH medium) (19Toyoda Y. Yokoyama M. Hoshi T. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1971; 16: 147-151Crossref Google Scholar) containing 50 mm Hepes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min, and extracted in PBS containing 30 mmn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine/HCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 6 h. The sperm suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant solution was used as “sperm protein extracts.” Hyaluronidase activity was measured by the colorimetric method using Alcian Blue 8 GX (Sigma), as described previously (20Pryce-Jones R.H. Lannigan N.A. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1997; 31: 92PCrossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was conducted in a mixture (0.6 ml) of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, containing 50 mm MgCl2, 40 μg of human umbilical cord hyaluronic acid (Sigma), and an appropriate amount of enzyme. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was mixed with 0.02% Alcian blue solution (0.6 ml), and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Absorbance of the supernatant solution at 603 nm was measured using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer. A standard curve of hyaluronidase activity was obtained using bovine testicular hyaluronidase (295 units/mg, Sigma H3506) under the above described conditions. Cauda epididymal sperm in Hepes-buffered TYH medium (5 × 107 sperm/ml) were induced to undergo acrosome reaction by the addition of calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h under 5% CO2 in air (21Yamagata K.

The sperm suspension was centrifuged twice at 800 ×g for 10 min to remove contaminating sperm. The supernatant was then centrifuged in a Beckman Optima MAX-E Ultracentrifuge using a TLA-100.3 rotor at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The resulting supernatant was used as a source of soluble proteins released by the A23187-induced acrosome reaction, including acrosomal components (SPA fraction). The precipitate obtained by ultracentrifugation was washed with PBS and extracted at 4 °C for 6 h in PBS containing 30 mmn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine/HCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), as described above. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was used as a source of membranous proteins on the plasma and outer acrosomal membranes fused during the acrosome reaction (MPA fraction). Proteins were also extracted from acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm with the same PBS containingn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and protease inhibitors (AI and AR fractions, respectively). The concentrations of proteins in the four fractions were determined using a Coomassie protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 2% skim milk, the blots were incubated with affinity-purified anti-mouse PH-20 antibody at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 1 h. The immunoreactive proteins were detected by an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To detect proteins exhibiting hyaluronidase activity, SDS-PAGE in the presence of 0.01% human umbilical cord hyaluronic acid was carried out under nonreducing conditions as described previously (22Guntenhöner M.W. Pogrel M.A. Stern R. Matrix. 1992; 12: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were washed with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 2 h to remove SDS and then incubated in the same buffer without Triton X-100 at 37 °C overnight. The hyaluronic acid-hydrolyzing proteins were visualized as transparent bands against a blue background by staining the gels with 0.5% Alcian Blue 8 GX and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Sigma). Female ICR mice (8 weeks old) were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (5 units) followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (5 units) 48 h later. Eggs were collected from the oviductal ampulla of the superovulated mice at 15–16 h after injection of human chorionic gonadotropin and placed in an 0.2-ml drop of TYH medium (19Toyoda Y. Yokoyama M. Hoshi T. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1971; 16: 147-151Crossref Google Scholar) covered with mineral oil. Fresh cauda epididymal sperm from ∼3-month-old mice were capacitated by incubation for 2 h in a 0.2-ml drop of TYH medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. An aliquot of the capacitated sperm suspension (1.5 × 105 sperm/ml) was mixed with the eggs in TYH medium. The eggs and sperm were incubated for 0.5–6 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. At the end of incubation, the eggs were briefly treated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and then mounted on slides for whole-mount preparation. The eggs were stained with 0.25% lacmoid for the assessment ofin vitro fertilization as described (16Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Yamagata K. Murayama K. Kohno N. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Zygote. 1998; 6: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For competitive fertilization assay in vitro, eggs with or without associated cumulus cells were incubated with an equally mixed suspension of wild-type and PH-20-deficient mouse sperm. The final concentrations of sperm were 1.5 × 105 and 5.0 × 104 sperm/ml for the cumulus-intact and cumulus-free eggs, respectively. Following incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, the fertilized eggs were washed twice with a modified simplex-optimized medium, kSOM/AA (24Ho Y. Wigglesworth K. Eppig J.J. Schultz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and incubated at 37 °C for 96 h under 5% CO2 in air. Each of the developing embryos was lysed in a 0.04% SDS solution (2 μl) containing 24 mm NaOH by boiling for 3 min and was then used as a template for PCR amplification. The PCR reaction was carried out in a 40-μl mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP each at 0.2 mm, the oligonucleotide primers each at 1 μm, template DNA, and 1 unit of GeneTaq DNA polymerase (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan), using MHA3 (5′-TTGAAGTCCAATCGACAAGCT-3′), MHA16 (5′-GGTATTCAGAGGTACGATCAG-3′), and NP1 (5′-TCGTGCTTTACGGTATCGCCGGCTCCCGATT-3′) as primers. The reaction program consisted of 35 cycles of 94 °C for 60 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The DNA products amplified were analyzed by PAGE as described previously (25Ohmura K. Kohno N. Kobayashi Y. Yamagata K. Sato S. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29426-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To elucidate the functional role(s) of PH-20 in fertilization, the mouse PH-20 gene was disrupted in ES cells by homologous recombination using a targeting construct containing neo and HSV-TK expression cassettes (Fig.1A). A part of exon 2 (E2) coding for the hyaluronidase domain in the PH-20 gene was replaced by the neo cassette. Two of five independent ES cell clones carrying a mutated allele generated chimeric mice transmitting the allele to progeny. The genotypes of wild-type (Ph20+/+), heterozygous (Ph20+/−), and homozygous (Ph20−/−) mice for the null mutation of thePH-20 gene were determined by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). Northern blot analysis of testicular RNA demonstrated the absence of PH-20 mRNA in thePh20−/− mouse (Fig. 1C). The level of the PH-20 mRNA in the Ph20+/−mouse was ∼50% of that in the wild-type mouse. Moreover, protein extracts of cauda epididymal sperm fromPh20−/− mice completely lacked an immunoreactive 52-kDa protein corresponding to PH-20 when affinity-purified anti-mouse PH-20 antibody was used as a probe (Fig.1D). These data conclusively show the absence of PH-20 inPh20−/− mouse sperm. Male and female Ph20−/− mice were normal in behavior, body size, and health condition. Morphological analysis demonstrated no significant difference of the shapes, numbers, and sizes of testicular germ cells and epididymal sperm amongPh20+/+, Ph20+/−, and Ph20−/− mice (data not shown). Both the formation of copulation plugs in mated female mice and the motility of cauda epididymal sperm were also normal in the heterozygotes and homozygotes. Moreover, malePh20−/− mice showed normal fertility and produced an average litter size (means ± S.E. = 13.8 ± 0.4, 13.6 ± 1.4, and 12.2 ± 0.8 for 5, 5, and 21 litters inPh20+/+, Ph20+/−, and Ph20−/− mice, respectively). Essentially similar results were obtained in the mouse lines derived from two independent ES clones. Therefore, these results provide evidence that PH-20 is not essential for fertilization at least in the mouse. FemalePh20−/− mice also exhibited normal fertility. To examine whether the absence of PH-20 affects the process of sperm penetration through the layer of cumulus cells, in vitrofertilization analysis was carried out using capacitated cauda epididymal sperm. We have categorized the status of the mass of cumulus cells surrounding an egg into four patterns (patterns a, b, c, and d) to monitor successive dispersal of cumulus cells from the mass (Fig.2A). When the cumulus cell mass was incubated in the absence of sperm, cumulus cells were spontaneously broken away from the mass. However, the eggs were still associated with many cumulus cells (patterns a and b) in the masses even after the incubation for 6 h (Fig. 2B). Ph20+/+ mouse sperm readily dispersed cumulus cells from the mass, and ∼70% of the eggs completely lost cumulus cells (pattern d) 3 h after insemination. As compared with the wild-type mouse, thePh20−/− mouse showed a remarkable delay in the dispersal of cumulus cells from the mass. The ratio of the patternd cumulus cell mass was less than 20% in thePh20−/− mouse at 3 h after insemination. Thus, the delayed dispersal of cumulus cells may reflect the reduced ability of Ph20−/− mouse sperm to hydrolyze hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix of cumulus cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, anin vitro fertilization assay confirmed the fertility ofPh20−/− mouse sperm. AlthoughPh20+/+ and Ph20−/−mouse sperm equally fertilized the eggs 3 h after insemination, the rate of fertilization in Ph20−/− mouse sperm was significantly lower than that inPh20+/+ mouse sperm solely at the early stages (1 and 2 h) after insemination. To verify the delayed fertilization of Ph20−/− mouse sperm, eggs with or without associated cumulus cells were inseminated with an equally mixed suspension of Ph20+/+ and Ph20−/− mouse sperm. The fertilized eggs with male and female pronuclei were then developed into embryos in vitro, and the genotype of each of the embryos was assessed by PCR. Two DNA fragments with the sizes of 254 and 145 nucleotides, which were PCR-amplified from the null-mutated and wild-type alleles, respectively, were detected (Fig. 3B). When the cumulus-intact eggs were used, Ph20−/− mouse sperm were approximately three times slower to fertilize the eggs thanPh20+/+ mouse sperm (Fig. 3C). In the cumulus-free eggs, the fertilization rate inPh20−/− mouse sperm was still slow but close to that in Ph20+/+ mouse sperm. These data imply that the reduced fertilization rate in Ph20−/−mouse sperm may be due to the delay of the sperm penetration through the cumulus cell layer. Despite the time delay, Ph20−/− mouse sperm are indeed capable of penetrating the layer of cumulus cells. This fact raises a possibility that other hyaluronidase(s) besides PH-20 may be present in mouse sperm and may participate in the sperm penetration through the cumulus layer, possibly in cooperation with PH-20. To ascertain this possibility, acrosome-intact sperm were extracted withn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and total hyaluronidase activities in the sperm protein extracts were measured (Fig. 4A). The activities in the Ph20+/− and Ph20−/− mice were found to be ∼80 and 40% of that in the Ph20+/+ mouse, respectively. SDS-PAGE in the presence of hyaluronic acid revealed thatPh20+/+, Ph20+/−, and Ph20−/− mouse sperm all contain a hyaluronic acid-hydrolyzing protein(s) with an approximate size of 55 kDa (Fig.4B). A relatively sharp band of an enzymatically active 52-kDa protein was completely absent only in thePh20−/− mouse. Consequently, the 52-kDa protein corresponds to PH-20, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D). To examine the location of a 55-kDa protein(s) and PH-20 exhibiting hyaluronidase activity in sperm, four protein fractions (AI, AR, SPA, and MPA) were prepared from epididymal sperm ofPh20+/+ and Ph20−/−mice and analyzed by Western blotting using affinity-purified anti-mouse PH-20 antibody (Fig. 4C). Affinity-purified antibody against an acrosomal proacrosin-binding protein, sp32 (26Baba T. Niida Y. Michikawa Y. Kashiwabara S. Kodaira K. Takenaka M. Kohno N. Gerton G.L. Arai Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16976-16984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), was also used as a control. In the Ph20+/+mouse, only the SPA fraction contained no PH-20, whereas the 55-kDa protein was abundantly present in the SPA fraction. In addition, PH-20 was absent in the AI, AR, and MPA fractions from thePh20−/− mouse. These data clearly demonstrate the presence of other hyaluronidase(s) besides PH-20 presumably within the acrosome of mouse sperm. It should be noted that a very small amount of the hyaluronidase activity resulting from the 55-kDa protein(s) is also found in AR fraction. This may be due to the presence of contaminating acrosome-intact sperm in the AR fraction, because only 80–90% of sperm were acrosome-reacted by calcium ionophore A23187 under the conditions employed in the present study. Indeed, acrosomal protein sp32 is slightly but significantly detectable in the AR fraction (Fig. 4C). This study demonstrates both a partial contribution of mouse PH-20 toward the sperm penetration through the layer of cumulus cells (Figs. 2 and 3), and the presence of other hyaluronidase(s) besides PH-20 in mouse sperm (Fig. 4). PH-20 has long been thought to be the sole hyaluronidase involved in sperm penetration through the cumulus cell layer, because other sperm hyaluronidases have not been characterized well. Our results indicate that a 55-kDa protein exhibiting hyaluronidase activity is abundantly released by calcium ionophore-induced acrosome reaction presumably from the acrosome (Fig.4). If the acrosome reaction does not occur until acrosome-intact sperm reach the egg ZP, the 55-kDa hyaluronidase may be functional in the sperm/ZP interactions, including secondary sperm-ZP binding. It is also speculated that the motility may be the most important factor in the sperm penetration of the cumulus layer, if hyaluronidases other than PH-20 are absent on the sperm membrane. Thus, the other sperm hyaluronidases remain to be characterized. Mice carrying either of two Robertsonian translocations on chromosome 6, Rb(6.16) and Rb(6.15), have been reported as showing a significant transmission ratio distortion in the progeny (transmission ratios of 3.6:1 and 2.4:1, respectively) (28Aranha I.P. Martin-DeLeon P.A. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Chayko C.A. Martin-DeLeon P.A. Hum.

Cell Genet. 1995; 69: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), as found in the mice carrying different t alleles (31Silver L.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 179-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The impaired fertility of Rb-bearing sperm seems to be the result of a decreased amount of hyaluronidase activity on the sperm membrane (32Zheng Y. Deng X. Martin-DeLeon P.A. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The gene encoding sperm adhesion molecule 1, Spam1, identical to PH-20, is a candidate gene involved in the sperm dysfunction leading to transmission ratio distortion in the Rb(6.16) and Rb(6.15) mice (33Zheng Y. Martin-DeLeon P.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 54: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study, the impaired ability of Ph20−/− mouse sperm to fertilize cumulus-intact eggs in vitro (Fig. 3) is apparently consistent with the dysfunction of Rb-bearing mouse sperm. However, Ph20−/− male mice produce a normal average litter size, in contrast with the Rb homozygous mice. These data imply that the dysfunction of Rb-bearing mouse sperm may not be ascribed solely to the reduced amount of sperm Spam1/PH-20. The human and mouse genomes have been reported to possess six hyaluronidase-like genes, each three genes of which form a cluster on the chromosomes (34Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In the mouse, three genes corresponding to the human HYALP1, HYAL4, and PH-20/SPAM1 genes are clustered within the region of ∼65 kbp on mouse chromosome 6 A2 (34Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). As far as we have examined, the mouse HYALP1and PH-20/SPAM1 genes are both expressed exclusively in testicular tissues, whereas expression of the mouse HYAL4gene in the testis is barely detectable. We have also found the presence of an additional hyaluronidase-like gene (tentatively termedHYAL5) that is localized almost 100 kbp away from thePH-20/SPAM1 gene on the mouse chromosome 6. 2D. Baba and T. Baba, unpublished data. It has been demonstrated that multiple mutations occur in the PH-20/SPAM1 gene of Rb(6.16) and Rb(6.15) mice because of recombination suppression near the Rb junctions (35Zheng Y. Deng X. Zhao Y. Zhang H. Martin-DeLeon P.A. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 822-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), although no direct evidence has been provided that these mutations are responsible for the reduction in the hyaluronidase activity and gene expression. Even so, other point mutation(s) that affect the enzyme activity may occur in theHYALP1 and HYAL5 genes because of the localization adjacent to the PH-20/SPAM1 gene on chromosome 6. Thus, additional experiments concerning possible mutations in the HYALP1 and HYAL5 genes would seem to be required. Moreover, it is important to ascertain whether these gene products are indeed present in mouse sperm. The reduced rate of Ph20−/− mouse sperm inin vitro fertilization with cumulus-intact eggs (Fig. 3) appears to be ascribable solely to the delayed penetration through the layer of cumulus cells. However, there is a possibility that an incomplete interaction between Ph20−/− sperm and egg ZP, because of the absence of PH-20, may result in the reduced fertilization rate. Our preliminary experiments indicate that no significant difference of ability to bind cumulus-free, ZP-intact eggs 30 min after insemination was observed amongPh20+/+, Ph20+/−, and Ph20−/− mouse sperm (numbers of sperm bound to ZP/egg = 8.8 ± 1.6, 11.3 ± 1.8, and 11.5 ± 2.2, respectively). These data appear to weaken the possible importance of PH-20 in the sperm/ZP interactions, although we have not yet examined the effects of mouse sperm lacking PH-20 on the secondary sperm-ZP binding using “live” acrosome-reacted sperm. We thank Dr. P. Primakoff for the kind gift of recombinant mouse PH-20."

In the adult cat, asynchronous visual stimuli in two adjacent retinal regions controlled the relative spike timing of two groups of cortical neurons with high precision. This asynchronous pairing induced rapid modifications of intracortical connections and shifts in receptive fields. These changes depended on the temporal order and interval between visual stimuli in a manner consistent with spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. Parallel to the cortical modifications found in the cat, such asynchronous visual stimuli also induced shifts in human spatial perception."

Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). They play central roles in various cellular processes that include redox reactions, metabolic catalysis, and the sensing of iron and ambient oxygen levels (2Cammack R. Cammack R.

The process of Fe/S protein biogenesis is highly conserved in nature and is mediated by a set of key components that, in bacteria, are frequently encoded by the so-called isc(iron-sulfur cluster assembly) operon (5Zheng L.

Other homologues are part of the sufoperon, which is thought to be involved in iron and sulfur metabolism in bacteria and intracellular parasites (11Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J.

Fe/S protein assembly is initiated by the abstraction of sulfan sulfur from cysteine, a reaction catalyzed by a cysteine desulfurase such as IscS or NifS (13Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F.

In vitro, cysteine desulfurase is sufficient to mediate the assembly of functional Fe/S proteins from cysteine and ferrous iron. However, in biological systems, the reaction is far more complex and involves proteins such as IscU (yeast Isu proteins) or IscA (yeast Isa proteins) that function as initial iron- and sulfur-binding proteins and as scaffolds for the assembly of a transient Fe/S cluster (16Yuvaniyama P.

In eukaryotes such as S. cerevisiae, Fe/S proteins are most frequently found in mitochondria, although only a few examples have been located in the cytosol and the nucleus (38Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a central role in the biosynthesis of cellular Fe/S proteins in yeast. The ISC assembly machinery of mitochondria is required for the biosynthesis of Fe/S proteins that perform central roles in respiration (i.e. complexes I, II, and III of the respiratory chain) and the citric acid cycle (i.e. aconitase). Most of the components of the ISC assembly machinery are closely related to the bacterial Isc proteins, indicating a bacterial origin for this essential mitochondrial process. Moreover, yeast mitochondria are also involved in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins such as the isopropyl malate dehydrogenase, Leu1p, or the RNase L inhibitor, Rli1p (8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 21Kaut A. Lange H. Diekert K. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol.

So far, two mitochondrial proteins with a specific function in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins have been identified; they are the ABC transporter Atm1p of the inner membrane and the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1p in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (39Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Orthologues of both proteins are found in most eukaryotes, including man, but are absent in bacteria. In addition, glutathione was found to be necessary for maturation of cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, Fe/S proteins. 2Sipos, K., Lange, H., Fekete, Z., Ullmann, P., Lill, R., and Kispal, G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277,26944–26949. The maturation of Fe/S proteins in S. cerevisiae has been studied extensively by a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques that allow the analysis of Fe/S protein formation in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 38Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The possibility of using intact isolated mitochondria to study Fe/S protein maturation in vitro has recently been shown by demonstrating that mitochondrial ferredoxin is assembled into the holoform upon import into isolated mitochondria (41Lutz T. Westermann B. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although both approaches allow the identification of components involved in Fe/S protein maturation, they are not suitable for mechanistic studies of the particular reactions making up this process. In this study, we have established experimental systems that allow the in vitro analysis of the assembly of Fe/S proteins in yeast mitochondria. We report the first in vitroreconstitution of the entire pathway of Fe/S protein maturation in mitochondria. Our study has revealed several biochemical requirements of this complex process and provides a basis for further dissection of the molecular mechanism of cellular Fe/S protein formation in eukaryotes.

The determination of Fe/S protein formation in vitro was carried out using mitochondria isolated from yeast strains overexpressing BIO2 (encoding mitochondrial biotin synthase) under the control of the strong constitutive TDH3promoter from plasmids p426GPD or p424GPD, respectively (45Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C in glucose-containing synthetic minimal media lacking added iron chloride. At an optical density of 1–2 at OD600, cells were harvested, and mitochondria were isolated as described (46Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro experiments were carried out under anoxygenic conditions in an anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratories) filled with 90% nitrogen and 10% hydrogen gas. In a standard assay, 50–100 μg of isolated mitochondria from iron-starved cells were resuspended in 250 μl of buffer A (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.6 m sorbitol) (47Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NADH, 10 μmpyridoxalphosphate, and 0.2 mm cysteine. Organelles were lysed with Triton X-100 (0.1% final) and incubated with 5 μCi of55FeCl3 (NEN) for 2.5 to 3 h at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions. The labeling reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 mm EDTA on ice. Membrane debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 15,000 × g), and Bio2p was immunoprecipitated from the clarified reaction mixture using anti-Bio2p antibodies attached to protein A-Sepharose as described previously (8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 48Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Radioactivity associated with the precipitated immunobeads was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The S.E. of the assay was between 5 and 20%. ATP depletion of the reaction mixture was carried out by the addition of 25 mm glucose and 20 units of hexokinase (Sigma) 5 min prior to the addition of radioactive iron. Endogenous NADH was depleted by a 5 min preincubation with 10 mm acetaldehyde and 100 units of alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma). For the analysis of iron import into isolated mitochondria, 100 μg of intact mitochondria prepared from aBIO2-overproducing wild-type strain were incubated with 5 μCi of 55FeCl3 for 90 min at 25 °C in 250 μl of buffer A supplemented with 1 mm ascorbate, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm NADH, and 5 mmcysteine. The labeling reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 mm EDTA on ice, and mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g). Mitochondria were lysed in 250 μl of TNETG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) for 5 min on ice, membrane debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 15,000 × g), and Bio2p was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant as described above. For the expression of S. cerevisiae NFS1 in E. coli, the coding region was modified by PCR to create anNdeI site and an ATG codon at Ser-68. The PCR product was inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of vector pET15b (49Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Nfs1p was synthesized in E. coli strain HMS174 (DE3) grown at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μm pyridoxal phosphate. Six hours after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside, cells were harvested, resuspended in TS buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 75 mm NaCl), and lysed by sonication. The cleared cell extract was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the 35–65% ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to a phenyl-agarose column equilibrated with 15% ammonium sulfate-saturated TS buffer. Nfs1p was eluted with a gradient from 15 to 0% ammonium sulfate and purified further by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S300 column in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. Purified Nfs1p eluted at 100 kDa. Nfs1p-directed Fe/S protein assembly was carried out using recombinant apoferredoxin from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus as a reporter (50Floss B. Igloi G.L. Cassier-Chauvat C. Mühlenhoff U. Photosyn. Res. 1997; 54: 63-71Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The soluble apoprotein was prepared as described (51Meyer J. Moulis J.M. Lutz M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 243-249Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a standard reaction, 10 μg of apoferredoxin were incubated with 10 μg of Nfs1p in buffer A supplemented with 0.2 mm cysteine, 1 mm Na-ascorbate, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm pyridoxalphosphate, and 5 μCi of 55FeCl3 for 90 min at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 mm EDTA on ice. Radioactive holoferredoxin was recovered by ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose as described (50Floss B. Igloi G.L. Cassier-Chauvat C. Mühlenhoff U. Photosyn. Res. 1997; 54: 63-71Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the amount of 55Fe incorporation into ferredoxin was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To investigate the formation of Fe/S proteins in mitochondria in vitro, we established a radioassay in which a mitochondrial Fe/S protein in its apoform was labeled with55Fe by the presence of detergent lysates of isolated mitochondria. The radiolabeled Fe/S holoprotein was subsequently purified by immunoprecipitation from the reaction mixture, and the amount of radioactive 55Fe firmly associated with the washed immunobeads was quantified by scintillation counting. As a reporter protein, we chose the mitochondrial Fe/S protein biotin synthase, Bio2p, which could be accumulated at high levels in yeast mitochondria when BIO2 was overexpressed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter. The protein has been routinely used for the in vivo measurement of Fe/S protein formation in yeast (for example, see Ref. 39Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To obtain mitochondria with a large proportion of Bio2p in its apoform, organelles were prepared from iron-deprived yeast cells cultivated in synthetic minimal medium that lacked added iron salts. A time-dependent formation of Fe/S clusters on Bio2p was observed upon incubation of mitochondrial detergent extracts derived from iron-starved yeast cells with radioactive55Fe2+ at physiological pH (Fig.1A). No further supplementation was required to obtain this basal activity. The rate of55Fe association with Bio2p increased ∼5-fold under optimized conditions involving supplementation of the mitochondrial extracts with cysteine, NADH, and the reducing agent DTT (see below). This assay under optimized (standard) conditions faithfully reflected the assembly of Fe/S clusters on apo-Bio2p because the co-immunoprecipitation of 55Fe depended on the overexpression of Bio2p and the use of specific antibodies against this protein (Fig. 1B). It also displayed a dependence on cysteine (see below). Furthermore, the rate of 55Fe incorporation was strongly reduced at lower temperatures, as expected for an enzyme-catalyzed process. The reaction required anaerobic conditions because little Fe/S protein formation was observed in the presence of oxygen (Fig. 1B). Because the immunoprecipitation that followed the initial Fe/S protein-forming incubation was carried out under aerobic conditions, the formation of the Fe/S protein must be the oxygen-sensitive step. The time-dependence of the reaction was linear over the period investigated with a rate of Fe/S protein formation of 0.4 pmol 55Fe/mg mitochondria/min under optimized conditions (Fig. 1A). We used the in vitro assay to characterize the biochemical requirements for mitochondrial Fe/S protein formation. At first, we investigated the effect of cysteine because this is the presumed substrate of the mitochondrial cysteine desulfurase, Nfs1p, which is thought to provide the sulfur moiety for Fe/S clustersin vivo (8Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 52Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The activity of mitochondrial extracts was increased 3-fold upon supplementation with cysteine (up to 0.2 mm in the presence of 1 mm DTT and 0.2 mm NADH) (Fig.2A). The dependence of the55Fe association with Bio2p on the addition of cysteine shows that indeed an Fe/S cluster was formed. Essentially all in vitro Fe/S cluster reconstitution protocols that involve homologues of Nfs1p to generate the sulfur atoms of the Fe/S cluster from cysteine include compounds with reduced thiol groups such as β-mercaptoethanol or DTT. Addition of DTT largely increased the Fe/S protein formation activity of mitochondrial extractsin vitro (Fig. 2B). The stimulatory effect was concentration-dependent with a maximum at 1 mmDTT. Other thiol group-containing biochemicals such as β-mercaptoethanol and reduced glutathione only slightly stimulated Fe/S protein maturation by mitochondrial extracts, with stimulatory effects of 33 and 15%, respectively, of that achieved by DTT at the same concentration (Fig. 2B). Methionine had no effect, and the presence of the reducing agent dithionite had an adverse influence on Fe/S cluster formation on Bio2p, indicating that the stimulatory effect of DTT was not the result of its reducing capacities but rather involves the specific chemistry of thiol groups. Cysteine desulfurases efficiently transfer the sulfur atom from cysteine to dithiol group-containing biochemicals such as DTT (13Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 14Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether yeast Nfs1p functions as a cysteine desulfurase, and we monitored the effect of the thiol compounds on the Nfs1p-mediated reaction. A bacterial [2Fe-2S]ferredoxin in its apoform was incubated in the presence of purified recombinant Nfs1p with cysteine and radioactive 55Fe under anaerobic conditions. Holoprotein formation was subsequently quantified by determining the radioactivity firmly associated with the re-isolated holoferredoxin. As shown in Fig. 3, Nfs1p catalyzed the efficient formation of holoferredoxin, yet the reaction required the presence of sulfhydryl-containing compounds. DTT had an over 100-fold stimulatory effect, whereas β-mercaptoethanol and reduced glutathione supported the process only at 25 and 9%, respectively, of the rate in the presence of DTT. Thus, the stimulatory effects of these sulfhydryl-containing biochemicals on the Nfs1p-directed Fe/S protein formation were strikingly similar to those observed with mitochondrial extracts. In addition, the inclusion of reducing agents that lack sulfhydryl groups, such as NADH or dithionite, had little or no effect (Fig. 3). Taken together, Nfs1p functions as a cysteine desulfurase. A dithiol compound appears to be crucial for efficient assembly of Fe/S proteins in vitro. The physiological counterpart of DTT remains unknown at present. We used thein vitro Fe/S protein assembly system to investigate the energy requirements of Fe/S protein assembly. A dependence on NADH was reasonable to expect, because Fe/S protein formation in vivoinvolves a ferredoxin that presumably is reduced by NADH in a reaction mediated by ferredoxin reductase (33Lange H. Kispal G. Kaut A. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 34Li J. Saxena S. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1503-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Supplementation of thein vitro assay system with up to 0.2 mm NADH resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in Fe/S protein formation (Fig.4A). Higher concentrations had no further beneficial effect. When mitochondrial extracts were depleted of endogenous NADH by the addition of alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde, Fe/S protein formation decreased to levels below those observed in the absence of added NADH. Nevertheless, the residual amount of Fe/S protein maturation occurred at about half the optimal rate, indicating that NADH was either not fully depleted by alcohol dehydrogenase treatment or that it is not absolutely essential for mitochondrial Fe/S protein formation in vitro. Most likely, electrons can also be provided from other sources. In this context, we found that NADPH may be substituted for NADH; NADPH supported thein vitro Fe/S protein formation at almost the same rate as that observed with NADH (Fig. 4A). We next analyzed the requirement of ATP for Fe/S protein maturation. ATP is presumed to be utilized by the chaperone Ssq1p, which is thought to cooperate with its co-chaperone Jac1p in Fe/S cluster assembly. However, addition of ATP to the reaction mixtures had opposing effects on the rates of Fe/S protein formation in vitro, most likely because ATP is an efficient iron chelator at higher concentrations and thus may reduce the availability of radioactive 55Fe in the assay (Fig. 4B and Ref. 47Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, the involvement of ATP in Fe/S protein maturation was studied by depletion of the endogenous ATP levels present in mitochondrial extracts with hexokinase and glucose treatment. Under these conditions, a 7-fold decline in Fe/S protein formation activity was observed (Fig. 4B). The residual activity was only slightly above the detection limit of the assay. An essential involvement of ATP in the formation of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins in vitro is therefore likely. Thus, our in vitro assay for the first time allowed the direct measurement of a requirement of NADH and ATP for the maturation of a mitochondrial Fe/S protein. We studied the need of components of the ISC assembly machinery for Fe/S protein maturation in vitro. At first we analyzed mitochondrial extracts from the strain Gal-ISA1, which carries the ISA1 gene under the control of a galactose-inducible GAL1–10 promoter (21Kaut A. Lange H. Diekert K. Kispal G.

(iii) Chemical levels of α3 and CD9 in the total extract or membrane fractions from cells grown under +Gal versus −Gal condition were nearly identical, whereas α3 expressed at the cell surface, probed by antibody binding in flow cytometry, was higher under −Gal than +Gal condition. These results suggest that GM3 synthesized under +Gal condition promotes interaction of α3 with CD9, which restricts α3 binding to its antibody.

Based on the promotion of α3/CD9 interaction by GM3 and the status of laminin-5 as a true ligand for α3, the laminin-5/α3-dependent motility of ldlD/CD9 cells was found to be greatly enhanced under −Gal condition, but strongly inhibited under +Gal condition. Such a motility difference under +Gal versus −Gal condition was not observed for ldlD/moc cells.

During a search for antibodies that inhibit cell motility (13Miyake M. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3328-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a membrane protein with sequence identical to that of the previously known CD9 was identified as a motility regulatory factor (14Miyake M. Koyama M. Seno M. Ikeyama S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). CD9 expression in metastatic deposits is much lower than in normal tissues or non-metastatic tumors, and transfection of the CD9 gene in CD9-non-expressing cells results in suppression of both haptotactic and phagokinetic motility (15Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2335-2339PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies have shown that coexpression of GM3 1 and CD9 is essential for motility inhibition of various human colonic, gastric, and lung cancer cell lines and of the Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell line ldlD14, deficient in UDP-Gal 4-epimerase (16Ono M. Handa K. Sonnino S. Withers D.A. Nagai H. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6414-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). ldlD14 cells are convenient for testing the effect of endogenous GM3 and theN- or O-glycosylation status of membrane proteins because they follow such a glycosylation change in response to the presence or absence of galactose in the culture medium (17Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). GM3 was identified as a cofactor of CD9 for suppression of cell motility, but the mechanism of this effect has been unclear. Although CD9 expressed in ldlD cells by its gene transfection (ldlD/CD9 cells) is not susceptible to N- or O-glycosylation, integrins are N-glycosylated, and their functions, including α/β-subunit interaction, are affected by N-glycosylation (3Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study is focused on (i) the interaction of α3 with CD9 and the enhancing effect of GM3 ganglioside on this interaction in low-density glycolipid-enriched microdomain (GEM) fractions and (ii) the strong inhibitory effect of this interaction on laminin-5 (LN5)/α3-dependent cell motility. The level of the α3/CD9/GM3 interaction in GEM is independent of the total cellular level of α3 and CD9, but depends closely on the glycosylation status of the cells, which controls GEM organization. This study also reveals, for the first time, that CD9 is a typical proteolipid, based on its solubility in chloroform/methanol and its interaction with gangliosides. The Chinese hamster ovary mutant cell line ldlD14, deficient in UDP-Gal 4-epimerase (17Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Monty Krieger (Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). ldlD14 cells expressing CD9 through its gene transfection (ldlD/CD9 cells) were established as described previously (15Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2335-2339PubMed Google Scholar). ldlD14 cells treated with the pcDNA3 vector alone, selected based on neomycin resistance, were cloned and used as control cells (termed “ldlD/moc”). CD9 was undetectable in the original ldlD14 cells examined with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Hamster NIL cells were positive with the same reagents. These transfectants were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The glycosylation pattern was altered by replacing the above medium with serum-free Ham’s F-12 medium and insulin/transferrin/selenium medium (BD PharMingen) (18Krieger M. Reddy P. Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Hobbie L. Penman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 57-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), termed ITS/F-12 medium, with or without 20 μm Gal on day 1, and culturing in this medium for 3 days. GM3 was the major glycosphingolipid in ldlD/moc and ldlD/CD9 cells grown in ITS/F-12 medium with galactose (+Gal condition), but was completely absent in cells grown without galactose (−Gal condition). No other gangliosides were detectable. Glucosylceramide was the major glycosphingolipid in both cell lines under −Gal condition, as observed previously (15Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2335-2339PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of α3integrin was higher under +Gal compared with −Gal condition, confirming that N-glycosylation of α3 is completed under the former condition, as observed previously for α5 (19Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Addition of GalNAc had no effect on the molecular mass of α3 and did not cause synthesis of gangliosides more complex than GM3. The molecular mass of CD9 was unchanged regardless of Gal or GalNAc addition. IgG3 mAb DH2 directed against GM3 was established in this laboratory (20Dohi T. Nores G. Hakomori S.

Rabbit antibodies to caveolin-1 (N20) and the internal domain of CD9 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antisera to α3 integrin (AB1920) and α5 integrin (AB1949) were from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). These rabbit antibodies were reactive with their respective molecules from human, mouse, rat, and hamster (reactivity with molecules of hamster origin is based on our own experience). Mouse IgG1 mAb to human LN5 (epiligrin) was from Chemicon International, Inc.. Mouse IgG mAb to γ-tubulin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and fibronectin were from Sigma.

The source of LN5 was serum-free conditioned medium in which human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK) were grown (kindly donated by Dr. William G. Carter, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) (22Xia Y. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ldlD/CD9 cells (2 × 105/well) were seeded in Ham’s F-12 medium plus 5% fetal calf serum in six-well plates, cultured overnight, and washed with Ham’s F-12 medium; and ITS/F-12 medium with or without 20 μm Gal was added. Plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3 days. Each well was washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 2.68 mm KCl, and 1.47 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)), and then 300 μl of 1× sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, and 10% glycerol) was added. Plates were placed in a 100 °C water bath for 5 min. The cell lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, homogenized by five passes through a 25-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 8000 × g; and 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for determination of α3 and CD9 as described previously (15Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2335-2339PubMed Google Scholar,19Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Band intensities for α3 and CD9 were compared with that for γ-tubulin after reblotting (see “Quantitative Evaluation of α3 and CD9 Bands by Western Blotting”). ldlD/CD9 cells (3 × 106/15-cm diameter plate) were seeded in Ham’s F-12 medium with 5% fetal calf serum. For one experiment, six plates were prepared, each with the same number of cells, and cultured overnight. The medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with Ham’s F-12 medium. ITS/F-12 medium with 20 μm Gal was added to three plates; ITS/F-12 medium without Gal was added to the other three plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3 days. Cells were then harvested by rubber scraper and centrifuged; and pellets from cells grown under +Gal and −Gal conditions were suspended in Brij 98 lysis buffer (1% Brij 98, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 75 units of aprotinin and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was agitated for 20 min at 4 °C and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (10–20 strokes) to give the “total lysate,” and aliquots of the total lysate were used for determination of α3 and CD9 levels based on equal protein content and the loading control (see the legend to Fig. 2A, panel 1). The total lysate was then centrifuged at 1300 ×g for 5 min to separate bulky insoluble material, hereafter termed the first precipitate (Ppt1), from the supernatant post-nuclear fraction (Pnf). The entire procedure after cell lysis was performed at 0–4 °C as described previously (23Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 24Yamamura S. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ppt1 comprised cell nuclei, some cytoskeletal components, extracellular matrix proteins, and a portion of cellular integrins (26Carter W.G. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6953-6960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); these Ppt1 components were solubilized in sample buffer containing SDS by boiling for 5 min. Pnf contained fine, neutral detergent-insoluble membrane particles that constitute the major membrane components in GEM (see below). The protein content of the total lysate, Ppt1, and Pnf was determined using the Micro-BCA kit. Using standard procedures, Ppt1 comprised 5–10% and Pnf comprised 90–95% of the total lysate protein. Aliquots of the total lysate, Ppt1, and Pnf were analyzed for α3 and CD9 by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using specific antibodies as described above (see legend to Fig. 2A, panels 2 and3).Figure 2Distribution patterns of α3 and CD9 in ldlD/CD9 cells.A: shown are α3 and CD9 levels in the total Brij 98 lysate, Pnf, and Ppt1 from cells grown under −Galversus +Gal condition. The total lysate, Pnf, and Ppt1 fractions were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.”Panel 1, aliquots of the total Brij 98 lysate with equal protein content (30 μg) were used for determination of α3 (left) and CD9 (right), with γ-tubulin as a loading control, under −Gal versus +Gal condition. Each bar represents the mean densitometric value for α3 or CD9 divided by that for γ-tubulin from the same Western blot, as described for Fig. 1A. p = 0.763 for α3 comparison and 0.592 for CD9 comparison. Panel 2, aliquots of Pnf with equal protein content (18 μg) were used for determination of α3(left) and CD9 (right), with γ-tubulin as a loading control, under −Gal versus +Gal condition.Bars are as described for Panel 1. p = 0.341 for α3 comparison and 0.282 for CD9 comparison. Panel 3, Ppt1 derived from 1 ml of total Brij 98 lysate was dissolved in 1 ml of SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. 20-μl aliquots were used for determination of α3 (left) and CD9 (right), with γ-tubulin as a loading control, under −Gal versus +Gal condition. Bars are as described for Panel 1. p = 0.189 for α3 comparison and 0.858 for CD9 comparison. B: Pnf prepared from 4 × 107 cells was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described under “Materials and Methods.” An equal volume (10 μl) from each fraction (fractions 1–12, the order from low to high density) was analyzed by SDS-8% PAGE and Western-blotted with antibody to α3 or CD9. Numbers on the right indicate positions of molecular mass markers (in kilodaltons). Note that the majority of α3 and CD9 were located in low-density GEM fractions (fractions 4–6) regardless of +Gal or −Gal condition. C: panel I, an equal protein quantity (0.25 μg) from fraction 5, the combined soluble high-density fraction (fractions 10–12) (designated S), or Pnf from ldlD/CD9 (left) or ldlD/moc (right) cells was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Note that levels of α3 and CD9 from ldlD/CD9 cells were higher under +Gal than −Gal condition (comparison 1), whereas no such difference was seen for ldlD/moc cells (comparison 2).Panel II, shown is the comparative degree of α3 expression (intensity) for ldlD/CD9 versusldlD/moc cells as determined by quantitative densitometry using Scion software. The +Gal/−Gal ratio (i.e. intensity value under +Gal condition divided by the corresponding value under −Gal condition) was calculated as 1.87 for comparison 1 and 0.96 for comparison 2 for one particular case, i.e.0.25 μg of protein from fraction 5 as described above. D: shown is the degree of α3 expression by plotting the +Gal/−Gal ratio for α3 present in fraction (Fr.) 5 or in GEM in multiple experiments ofcomparison 1 or 2, determined as described forC (panel II). ◯, α3 in fraction 5 from ldlD/moc cells; •, α3 in fraction 5 from ldlD/CD9 cells; ▵, α3 in GEM (combined fractions 4–6) from ldlD/moc cells; ▴, α3 in GEM from ldlD/CD9 cells.

Western-blotted bands for α3 and CD9 (developed by luminography) from cells grown under +Gal and −Gal conditions were determined quantitatively by densitometry using the Scion Image software program (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Band intensities were designated “I-α3+Gal,” “I-α3−Gal,” “I-CD9+Gal,” and “I-CD9−Gal,” respectively. The same immunoblot was then treated with stripping buffer (2% SDS in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) and 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol) (27Kaufman S.H. Ewing C.M. Shaper J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) at 55 °C for 30 min, blocked with fat-free milk, and reblotted with anti-γ-tubulin antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for luminography. The bands for γ-tubulin from the same immunoblots used for determination of α3 and CD9 under +Gal and −Gal conditions were quantitated using the Scion software. Band intensities of loading controls were designated “Ld-α3+Gal,” “Ld-α3−Gal,” “Ld-CD9+Gal,” and “Ld-CD9−Gal,” respectively. The values obtained by dividing I-α3+Gal by Ld-α3+Gal, etc., were compared. Pnf prepared from ∼4 × 107 cells was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 4 °C to separate the low-density light-scattering membrane fraction. Twelve fractions (each 1 ml) were separated and numbered 1–12 according to density (low to high), as in previous studies (24Yamamura S. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The low-density light-scattering component was present mainly in fraction 5 and at a much lower level in fractions 4 and 6. The protein content of each fraction was determined using the Micro-BCA kit. The majority (∼95%) of the proteins in Pnf were found in soluble high-density fractions 10–12; ∼5% were found in low-density fractions 4 and 5 (GEM). Aliquots containing an equal volume (10 μl) or an equal protein content (0.25 μg) of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using specific antibodies as described above. Cells were detached from the culture dish with 0.53 mm EDTA and PBS and suspended in Ham’s F-12 medium. Defined aliquots of cells (1 × 105) as pellets in Eppendorf tubes were treated with 100 μl of mouse or rabbit antibody to α3 or CD9 (90 min on ice), washed with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% azide, incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody, washed, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fluorescence patterns were determined using a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer. Cells (1–2 × 107) were grown, washed with PBS, harvested by rubber scraper, and centrifuged at 1300 × g for 5 min. PBS was carefully removed by aspiration, and the wet cell pellet was weighed (difference of centrifuge tube weight before versus after pelleting). The pellet was extracted with 20 volumes of solvent (twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and then twice with chloroform/methanol/water (1:1:0.1)) by sonication for 30 min and centrifuged at 1300 × g for 15 min. Part of the combined extract was dried under N2 stream; the residue was dissolved in 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1); and to this was added 0.5 ml of water for the Folch partition procedure (28Folch J. Arsove S. Meath J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 819-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the upper and lower layers were separated. Each extract, combined Folch upper phases, and Folch lower phase, were evaporated to dryness, solubilized in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-CD9 antibody. ldlD/CD9 cells (1–2 × 107/dish) grown under +Gal or −Gal condition were harvested by rubber scraper, washed with PBS, suspended in 1 ml of Brij 98 lysis buffer, agitated thoroughly for 1 h at 4 °C, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 10,500 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used for co-IP. For some experiments, fraction 5 separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was used for co-IP. The lysate (200 μl, containing 300 μg of protein) prepared as described above was mixed with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and precleared by stirring for 2 h at 4 °C. Fraction 5 (800 μl) was mixed with 80 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and precleared in the same way. The suspension was centrifuged at 1300 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was mixed with primary antibody. Co-IP between α3 and CD9 was performed by addition of 4 μl of anti-α3 antibody. Reciprocal co-IP was initiated by addition of 4 μl of anti-CD9 antibody. In each case, the mixture was stirred overnight at 4 °C; protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl) were added; and the mixture was stirred for 3 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 1300 × g for 5 min. The bead sediment was washed twice with 1 ml of Brij 98 lysis buffer containing aprotinin and 1 mm Na3VO4 and centrifuged at 1300 × g for 5 min. Sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the washed sediment, which was then subjected to SDS-8% PAGE followed by Western blotting. For co-IP between α3 and CD9, blotting was performed with anti-CD9 antibody. For reciprocal co-IP, blotting was performed with anti-α3 antibody. Sterile circular cover glass (15-mm diameter) was placed in each well of a 24-well plate (Nunc); 500 μl of Ham’s F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum was added; and the plate was washed three times with 500 μl of this medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells (2 × 104 in 500 μl of this medium) were then added to each cover glass and cultured for 24 h. The medium was changed to ITS/F-12 or ITS/F-12+Gal medium, and cells were cultured for 3 days. The cover glass in each well was removed carefully with fine forceps, washed three times with PBS, and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells fixed on the cover glass were washed three times with PBS and stored in Petri dishes in a cold room. Before staining, cells were placed in 50 mm NH4Cl in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 140 mm NaCl) for 10 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated with 5% BSA in TBS for 30 min. After BSA was eliminated, cells were double-stained with the following combination of antibodies. For double-staining of CD9 and α3, cells on each cover glass were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 75-μl aliquots from a 800-μl mixture containing 792 μl of PBS, 4 μl of mouse IgG anti-CD9 mAb, and 4 μl of rabbit IgG anti-α3antibody and washed three times with TBS. Cells on each cover glass were further incubated in a dark box with a 75-μl mixture of secondary antibodies (40 μl of FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig and 16 μl of Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig mixed with 744 μl of PBS) at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times with TBS. For double-staining of CD9 and GM3, cells on each cover glass were incubated for 1 h with 75-μl aliquots from an 800-μl mixture containing 792 μl of PBS, 4 μl of anti-CD9 antibody, and 4 μl of mouse IgM anti-GM3 mAb M2590; washed three times with TBS; and incubated in a dark box with a 75-μl mixture of secondary antibodies as follows. Cells were first incubated with AlexsFI-labeled anti-mouse IgM goat antibodies (green color; 40 μl in 760 μl of PBS) for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times with TBS, incubated with Texas Red-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (40 μl in 760 μl of PBS) for 1 h, and washed three times with TBS. Stained cells were mounted with a drop of Glycergel mounting medium (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) containing 1% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (fluorescence stabilizer; Sigma). Patterns of fluorescence were observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica Model TCS-SP) at excitation wavelengths of 568 nm for Texas Red-conjugated antibodies and 488 nm for FITC- or AlexsFI-conjugated antibodies. The amounts of commercial antibodies described in this section on a volume basis (in μl) are as recommended by the manufacturer. This procedure followed that described originally (22Xia Y. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of anti-LN5 mAb (2 μg/ml in sterile PBS) was added to the upper compartment of a Transwell polycarbonate membrane assembly (8.0-μm pore size; Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C to coat the upper surface of the membrane with the mAb. The membrane was then washed twice with PBS, and 100 μl of heat-denatured BSA in PBS (0.5 mg/ml) was added for 30 min at 80 °C (which inactivated contaminating vitronectin in BSA) and incubated for 30 min to block nonspecific binding to the coated membrane. The membrane was washed twice with PBS, and 200 μl of HFK-conditioned medium containing LN5 was added to the upper compartment and incubated for 1 h. The medium was replaced with fresh conditioned medium and incubated for 1 h. This process was repeated five times, thus saturating the anti-LN5 antibody at the surface of the Transwell membrane with LN5; an"

Several viruses capable of infecting Mo/Mφ modulate PGE2 synthesis in a way that favors the infection processes and the spread of virions. In the present work, we studied the effect of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infection of Mo/Mφ on PGE2 synthesis. Our results indicate that HHV-6 inducesCOX-2 gene expression and PGE2 synthesis within a few hours of infection. We mapped the different promoter elements associated with COX-2 gene activation by HHV-6 to two cis-acting elements: a cyclic AMP-responsive element and an activator protein-1 element. HHV-6 immediate-early protein 2 was identified as a modulator of COX-2 gene expression in Mo/Mφ. Finally, addition of PGE2 to HHV-6-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures was found to increase significantly viral replication. Overall, these results further contribute to the immunomodulatory properties of HHV-6 and highlight a potential role for eicosanoids in the replication process of this virus.

Takahashi M. Yamanishi K. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1401-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Following a primary infection, virus could only be recovered from macrophages suggesting that these phagocytes can serve as reservoir for lifelong persistence of HHV-6. Monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mφ) play a central role in immune response development by their ability to present antigens and secrete bioactive molecules. One such secreted product released by activated Mo/Mφ is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (12Humes J.L. Bonney R.J. Pelus L. Dahlgren M.E. Sadowski S.J. Kuehl Jr., F.A. Davies P. Nature. 1977; 269: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). PGE2is a potent lipid mediator of inflammation. The biosynthesis of PGE2, an arachidonic acid metabolite, is tightly controlled by the activity of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes (13DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 14Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. DeWitt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of the COX enzyme, COX-1 and COX-2, produced from differentially regulated genes. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues (15Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), whereas COX-2 is undetectable in normal tissues or resting immune cells, but its expression can be modulated by several stimuli (16Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Human COX-2 gene promoter contains several sequences that have been shown to act as positive regulatory elements for the COX-2 gene transcription in different cell types (for a review see Ref. 17Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). The COX-2 promoter contains a classical TATA box, an E box, and binding sites for transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB), nuclear factor-IL-6/CCAAT enhancer-binding protein, cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (18Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and nuclear factor-activated T cell/AP-1 (19Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Prostaglandins, particularly those of the E series, are widely regarded as pleiotropic immunomodulatory molecules, and the regulation of their expression appears to be critical for a number of immune responses. Several lines of evidence suggest that PGE2, in addition to its proinflammatory function, may exert anti-inflammatory effects. For example, PGE2 interferes with T lymphocyte responses by inhibiting the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) (20Chouaib S. Welte K. Mertelsmann R. Dupont B. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1172-1179PubMed Google Scholar), the major T cell growth factor. In this way, PGE2 blunts the proliferation of T lymphocytes, a crucial step in the expansion of T cell clones. PGE2 also inhibits the secretion of IFN-γ, a cytokine that has antiviral activity and is important in activating T cells and Mo/Mφ (21Hasler F. Bluestein H.G. Zvaifler N.J. Epstein L.B. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 768-772PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PGE2 inhibits the production of Th1-type cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-2), switching the immune response toward a Th2-type cytokine profile (IL-4 and IL-5), having limited effectiveness in the development of an effective anti-viral response (22Betz M. Fox B.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 108-113PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes/macrophages, a major source of PGE2, are not refractory to its effects. PGE2 inhibits IL-1 synthesis and major histocompatibility complex class II expression in macrophages (23Snyder D.S. Beller D.I. Unanue E.R. Nature. 1982; 299: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), limiting their ability to act as functional antigen-presenting cells (24Matis L.A. Glimcher L.H. Paul W.E. Schwartz R.H. Proc.

Many viruses that interact with Mo/Mφ, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human T lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), efficiently modulate, positively or negatively, the synthesis of PGE2 (26Foley P.

PGE2 synthesis modulation possibly represents a way that viruses have developed to alter the biological functions of these cells with an increase in viral replication and viral spread as the outcome. In fact, PGE2is reported to enhance the replication of CMV, HIV-1, and HSV-1 (30Kline J.N. Hunninghake G.M., He, B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Exp.

The effects of HHV-6 infection on PGE2 synthesis and vice versa are unknown. Given the ability of HHV-6 to modulate immune functions (33Flamand L. Gosselin J. D'Addario M. Hiscott J. Ablashi D.V.

In the present work, we dissected the mechanisms by which HHV-6 up-regulates PGE2 in monocytes/macrophages, and we identified the contribution of the different promoter elements in mediating COX-2 transcription. A candidate viral immediate-early gene was identified as a positive modulator of COX-2 gene expression. Finally, the effect of exogenously added PGE2 to HHV-6-infected PBMC cultures was determined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from healthy donors and isolated by centrifugation over lymphocyte separation medium. Monocytes were first enriched by centrifugation over a Percoll density gradient as described (38Denholm E.M. Wolber F.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 144: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and purified by cell-sorting procedure as described (28Savard M. Belanger C. Tremblay M.J. Dumais N. Flamand L. Borgeat P. Gosselin J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6467-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Epics Elite ESP; Coulter Electronics Canada, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). This procedure yielded >98% pure monocyte suspensions as determined by CD14 staining. The human cell lines Mono-Mac-1 and HeLa were cultured in RPMI and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics, respectively. All cell lines were tested and found to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Cyclosporin A was purchased from Novartis (Dorval, Quebec). PD 98059, KT-5720, U0124, U0126, SB 202190, and dicumarol were obtained from Calbiochem. The NS-398 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The HHV-6 (type B, Z29 strain) used in this study was propagated on Molt-3 cells as described (39Gravel A. Gosselin J. Flamand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19679-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After 7 days of infection, virus was concentrated from culture supernatant by centrifugation (38,800 × g, 2 h 40 min) and resuspended in a minimal volume of complete culture medium. HHV-6 preparation had a titer of 6 × 106 infectious particles/ml. Supernatants from mock-treated and HHV-6-infected monocytes cultures were harvested at the indicated times and tested for the presence of PGE2using a commercially available enzyme immunometric assay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The detection limit for PGE2 was 29 pg/ml, with less than 0.01% cross-reactivity for other PGs. At the indicated time, mock-treated and HHV-6-infected monocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated in 5% (w/v) dry milk in TBS-T saline (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.19 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min to block nonspecific sites. Blots were then incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing either anti-COX-2 (1/1000), anti-COX-1 (1/5000), or anti-actin (1/500) antibodies (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Membranes were washed twice with TBS-T and treated with either a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (1/10,000). Reactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human COX-2 promoter constructs were kindly provided by Dr. M. Fresno (Madrid, Spain) and have been described previously (19Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol.

Tomoiu, N. Cloutier, J. Gosselin, and L. Flamand, submitted for publication. Transfection of the human Mono-Mac-1 and HeLa cells was performed using DEAE-dextran and calcium phosphate transfection procedures, respectively. Mono-Mac-1 cells were washed once in a TS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mm NaHPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.7 mmCaCl2) and resuspended in 1 ml of TS buffer containing 10 μg of the indicated plasmids and 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature and 20 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were diluted with 5 ml of complete culture medium supplemented with 100 μm chloroquine. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged, resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in complete culture medium, and incubated at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were mock-treated or infected with HHV-6 for 4 h, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in complete medium for an additional 24 h. HeLa cells were plated (75,000/well) the day before transfection in 24-well plates. Five μg of total DNA was added per well. pcDNA vector (Invitrogen) was used to normalize DNA amounts. After overnight incubation, transfection medium was replaced with complete medium. Cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was determined following lysis of cells in 1× luciferase assay buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) using a MLX Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA). Total RNA was isolated from mock- or HHV-6-infected monocytes using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was treated with 2 units of RNase-free DNase for 30 min, phenol-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers and used for PCR amplification using primers specific for IE2 exon 2 (5′-CGA TCC AGT GGT GGA AGA AT-3′) and exon 3 (5′-CGT CCG CAT CAT GGT ATA GTC-3′). The PCR was amplified by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified cDNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicons were transferred by capillary diffusion onto a nylon membrane. DNA was cross-lined to membrane by UV exposure (1200 J). Membrane was incubated at 42 °C in a prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2× SSC, 1% SDS, and 1× Denhardt's solution) for 2 h. Hybridization was performed overnight in the same buffer containing 1 × 106cpm/ml of the γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific for IE2 (5′-GCC TGC TTT TTC CAG AAC TG-3′). Membrane was subsequently washed twice in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C for 20 min followed by two more stringent washes in 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C for 20 min before being exposed to film. Purified monocytes (6 × 106) were mock- or HHV-6-infected for 4 h. Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After a 15-min incubation on ice, cells were lysed by the addition of 0.6% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were isolated by centrifugation, and proteins were extracted with 50 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing protease inhibitors. Nuclear extracts were collected and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Nuclear extracts (3–5 μg) were incubated with poly(dI-dC) (0.2 mg/ml) and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) in a DNA binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 4% glycerol, 1% Ficoll, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl) on ice 10 min. Then, 60,000 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (CRE or AP-1) were added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. In the competition experiment, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added to the binding reaction mixture 10 min prior to probe addition. In supershift experiment, 1 μg of antibodies against CREB-1 protein, c-JUN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or purified rabbit IgG (negative control) were mixed with samples for 10 min prior to probe addition. DNA protein complexes were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE. PBMCs were stimulated with PHA (1 μg/ml) for 3 days. Cells were mock- or HHV-6-infected for 2 h (0.02 multiplicity of infection), then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in complete medium in the presence or absence of PGE2 (1 μm). After 4 days of infection, genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and processed for dot blot hybridization using Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Two and a half and 5 μg of DNA from each sample were applied to a nylon membrane. DNA was denatured with 0.4 n NaOH, neutralized with 0.2 m Tris-HCl, 1× SSC, and UV cross-linked (1200 J). Membrane was incubated at 42 °C in a prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2× SSC, 1% SDS, and 1× Denhardt's solution) for 2 h. Hybridization was performed overnight in the same buffer containing 1 × 106cpm/ml of denatured 32P-labeled ZVH14 probe specific for HHV-6 (44Josephs S.F. Ablashi D.V. Salahuddin S.Z. Jagodzinski L.L.

The membrane was subsequently washed twice in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C for 20 min followed by two more stringent wash in 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C for 20 min before being exposed to film.

Virol. 2001; 75: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that viruses able to infect human monocytes do modulate PGE2 synthesis. To establish whether HHV-6 affected this lipid mediator pathway, we monitored biosynthesis of PGE2in uninfected and HHV-6-treated monocyte cultures over an 8-h period. When monocytes were infected with HHV-6, PGE2 levels increased gradually (Fig. 1A) with detectable synthesis by 2 h and maximal activity recorded 8 h post-infection. Two enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, can be responsible for PGE2 synthesis. To discriminate which isoforms of COX are most likely involved in PGE2 synthesis following HHV-6 infection, we performed Western blots for these proteins. First, for individual samples to be compared, we needed to assess the relative amounts of proteins loaded for each. The actin content was estimated and found to be equal for each sample (Fig.1B). Second, the samples were analyzed for COX-2 and COX-1 protein expression. As shown in Fig. 1B, mock-treated monocytes do not constitutively express the COX-2 protein. However, COX-2 levels became detectable at 2 h post-infection and continued to increase up to 8 h, correlating directly with the release of PGE2. Levels of COX-1 isoform were not affected by HHV-6 (Fig. 1B). To confirm that COX-2 is the COX isoform responsible for HHV-6-related PGE2 production, we performed the experiment in the presence of NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor (45Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). A dose of 1 μm NS-398 resulted in a 97% reduction in HHV-6-related PGE2 production (data not shown) indicating that production of PGE2 in HHV-6-treated monocytes is directly linked to the induction of the COX-2 protein following infection. Depending of the cell type, several promoter elements were reported to play an important role in regulating COX-2gene transcription (19Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M.

Given the fact that monocytes are difficult to transfect in a reproducible fashion, we first analyzed COX-2 promoter activation in HHV-6 infected Mono-Mac-1. Mono-Mac-1 is a human cell line with properties of blood monocytes, which can be used as a model system to study monocytic functions in vitro(61Steube K.G. Teepe D. Meyer C. Zaborski M. Drexler H.G. Leuk. Res. 1997; 21: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Compared with the promoterless vector (i.e. PXP-2), the COX-2 promoter (P2-1900) was significantly activated during HHV-6 infection (200-fold) compared with non-infected cells (Fig.2). To map the regions responsible for this induction, we performed transient transfection experiments using deletion mutants of the COX-2 promoter constructs (Fig. 2). Transfection experiments with deletion constructs indicate that promoter elements between −88 and +104 (P2-192) were necessary and sufficient to induce strong luciferase activity after HHV-6 infection. The P2-150 construct containing only a TATA box as the promoter element was minimally activated by HHV-6. These results suggest that the proximal NFAT (pNFAT)/AP-1 and/or CREs within the −88/+104 region is/are likely responsible for promoter activation following HHV-6 infection. Three regulatory elements, including pNFAT, AP-1, and CRE, are located within the −88/+104-bp region of the COX-2 promoter. Because of the importance of this region for the inducibility of the promoter by HHV-6, we determined the contribution of these sites to the overall transcriptional regulation of the promoter by using constructs (P2-274 and P2-192) containing specific mutations within the dNFAT, pNFAT, AP-1, or CRE sites. Details on the wild type and specific mutants are presented in Fig.3A. The pNFATmut construct has both NFAT and AP-1 sites mutated, whereas in the CREmut construct, only the CRE site was modified. Transient transfection experiments with these plasmids indicated that mutation of the dNFAT element resulted in a strong induction of the promoter, as expected (Fig. 2). Mutation of the pNFAT/AP-1 or the CRE element severely diminished the HHV-6 induced promoter activity (Fig. 3B). Our results therefore suggest that both CRE and pNFAT/AP-1 elements are involved for COX-2 promoter activation by HHV-6. T"

The global temporal pattern of the [Ca2+]c changes produced by ACh or CCK stimulation differs significantly. The hypothesis was tested that CCK stimulation results in a protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of InsP3R and this event contributes to the generation of agonist-specific [Ca2+]c signals. Physiological concentrations of CCK evoked phosphorylation of the type III InsP3R, which was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PKA. Imaging of fura-2-loaded acinar cells revealed that the rate of [Ca2+]c rise during CCK-evoked oscillations slows with each subsequent oscillation, consistent with a developing modulation of release, whereas the kinetics of ACh-evoked oscillations remain constant. Stimulation of cells with ACh following activation of PKA resulted in a slowing of the ACh-evoked [Ca2+]c rise, which now resembled a time-matched CCK response. PKA activation also resulted in a slowing of [Ca2+]c increases elicited by photolysis of caged InsP3. Targeted, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of type III InsP3R is involved in a physiological CCK response, as disruption of the targeting of PKA with the peptide HT31 resulted in marked changes in the CCK-evoked [Ca2+]c signal but had no effect on ACh-evoked responses. Stimulation of cells with bombesin, which evokes [Ca2+]c oscillations indistinguishable from those produced by CCK, also results in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of type III InsP3R. Thus, we conclude that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of type III InsP3R is a general mechanism by which the patterns of [Ca2+]c oscillations are shaped in pancreatic acinar cells.

The acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas offer an ideal system in which to study the generation of agonist-specific [Ca2+]c signals. Stimulation of acinar cells with low doses of acetylcholine (ACh) or cholecystokinin (CCK) produces oscillations in [Ca2+]c that differ in terms of their frequency and temporal pattern as well as in the physiological processes controlled (9Yule D.I. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The global temporal pattern of ACh-evoked oscillations consists of regular oscillations with a frequency of 4–6/min superimposed on an elevated [Ca2+]cplateau, whereas CCK-evoked oscillations exhibit slower kinetics, typically less than 1 oscillation each min, and the spikes are excursions from at or near the base line [Ca2+]c. In terms of the spatial aspects of the agonist-induced signal, reports have suggested that responses stimulated by both ACh and CCK initiate in similar but not identical regions of the apical trigger zone and, at physiologically relevant concentrations, spread as a wave throughout the cell (10Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO Journal. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B.

These agonist-specific [Ca2+]csignals may be important in encoding specific physiological endpoints. ACh stimulation tends to result predominately in increased exocytotic secretion, whereas CCK stimulation results in increased gene transcription and protein synthesis in addition to secretion (12Schick J. Kern H. Scheele G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1569-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Yule D.I. Williams J.A. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed as underpinning the differences in [Ca2+]c signaling patterns stimulated by various agonists. One hypothesis suggests that these differences arise from CCK receptor coupling to the production of a novel putative second messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (14Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The primary evidence for this contention is that treatment of cells with NAADP results in Ca2+ release and that exogenously applied NAADP results in cross-desensitization of both CCK responses and subsequent NAADP-induced [Ca2+]c signals. Interestingly, stimulation of acinar cells with bombesin, which results in a pattern of [Ca2+]c signals very similar to those produced by CCK, is not antagonized by this maneuver (15Burdakov D. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 993-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Burdakov D. Cancela J.M. Petersen O.H. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), indicating that a signaling pathway involving NAADP, although possibly contributing to CCK-induced signaling, cannot account for the general pattern of [Ca2+]c signals initiated by these agonists.An additional proposal is that InsP3 production is differentially regulated upon stimulation with different agonists. This could occur through the interaction of an individual G protein-coupled receptor with a specific RGS protein, thus exerting control over the activity of Gαq and, subsequently, phospholipase C. In support of this idea, CCK and muscarinic receptor stimulation clearly show differential sensitivity to exogenously applied RGS proteins (17Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.K. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol.

Although these proposals are not mutually exclusive, an important starting point in evaluating any potential mechanisms is that the [Ca2+]c response to all agonists appears to be mediated through coupling to the Gαq family of heterotrimeric G proteins, as antagonism of Gαq family members abolishes [Ca2+]c signaling in response to CCK, muscarinic, and bombesin stimulation (19Xu X.

In addition, the importance of this pathway is emphasized by the observation that responses to all agonists can be inhibited by antagonism of InsP3R (14Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A.

Although other calcium release channels, such as ryanodine receptors, have been shown to play a role in agonist-induced signaling in acinar cells (22Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J. O'Sullivan A.J.

In pursuit of this hypothesis, we have recently demonstrated that CCK stimulation results in phosphorylation of type III InsP3R (25LeBeau A.P. Yule D.I. Groblewski G.E. Sneyd J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 851-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of this InsP3R can modulate the sensitivity of the receptor to InsP3, ultimately resulting in a diminished ability of the channel to release Ca2+ (26Giovannucci D.R.

The transgene expression did not change the seizure threshold, but consistently more neurons degenerated in brains of SwAPP mice as compared with wild-type littermates. The degenerating neurons were stained both by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling and by Gallyas silver impregnation. A susceptible population of neurons accumulated intracellular Aβ and immunoreacted with antibodies against activated caspase-3. To demonstrate that increased Aβ levels mediated the increased vulnerability, we infused antibodies against Aβ and found a significant reduction in neuronal loss that was paralleled by decreased brain levels of Aβ. Because the SwAPP mice exhibited no amyloid plaques at the age of these experiments, transgenic overproduction of Aβ in brain rendered neurons susceptible to damage much earlier than the onset of amyloid plaque formation. Our data underscore the possibility that Aβ is toxic, that it increases the vulnerability of neurons to excitotoxic events produced by seizures, and that lowering Aβ by passive immunization can protect neurons from Aβ-related toxicity.

The reasons for this discrepancy to AD pathology are unknown but may involve the young age of the mouse neurons along with the absence of pathogenic factors that may occur while aging. To examine whether transgenic expression of SwAPP in mouse brain increases the vulnerability of neurons to cellular stress, we induced seizures in mice expressing SwAPP and analyzed the neurodegeneration and apoptotic cell death in brains at different times following the seizures (39Schauwecker P.E. Steward O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4103-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 40Roux P.P. Colicos M.A. Barker P.A. Kennedy T.E. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8382-8393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined whether the increased levels of Aβ mediated the increased vulnerability of the SwAPP neurons. We report that brain neurons of SwAPP mice were more vulnerable than non-transgenic littermates, even before the onset of amyloid plaque formation, and that passive immunization with antibodies against Aβ protected the neurons from degeneration. SwAPP mice were obtained from Dr. K. Hsiao (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) (30Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W., Xu, S. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D.

The colony was maintained by backcrossing transgenic males to non-transgenic (non-tg) females from the same colony. Mice were housed under a light cycle of 12 h with dry food pellets and water available ad libitum, and experiments were done according to the guidelines for animal care of the University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. Mice were weaned at 4 weeks of age, and the presence of the SwAPP transgene was determined by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies and specific primers 5′-GTG GAT AAC CCC TCC CCC AGC CTA GAC CA-3′ and 5′-CTG ACC ACT CGA CCA GGT TCT GGG T-3′ (30Hsiao K.K.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6887-6896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 8-week-old SwAPP and non-transgenic littermates received an intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine (360–400 mg/kg, Sigma) 30 min after receiving an injection of scopolamine methyl-bromide (1 mg/kg, Sigma) to reduce peripheral cholinergic activation (40Roux P.P. Colicos M.A. Barker P.A. Kennedy T.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6887-6896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seizure severity was staged according to the clinical phenotype by two independent observers as follows: stage 1 (mild seizures): wet dog shakes, arrest, rigid posture, facial twitches; stage 2: head nodding, chewing; stage 3 (moderate seizures): forelimb clonus, continuos shaking, rearing, but not falling; stage 4: falling on forelimbs, rearing and falling; stage 5 (severe seizures): falling on side or back, hindlimb clonus, seizure of all limbs, repetitive seizures of body (42Racine R.J.

The time of onset and the severity of the seizures were monitored throughout the experiment (42Racine R.J. Gartner J.G. Burnham W.M. Brain Res. 1972; 47: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 43Racine R. Okujava V. Chipashvili S. Electroencephalograph. Clin.

A. 1997; 94: 10432-10437Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The duration of the seizures was kept constant in all groups by terminating the seizures with 10 mg/kg diazepam (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 30 min after the onset of seizures (40Roux P.P. Colicos M.A. Barker P.A. Kennedy T.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6887-6896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Biagini G. Avoli M. Marcinkiewicz J. Marcinkiewicz M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1814-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To ensure exact duration of seizures, mice with continued seizures of more than 2 min after diazepam injections were eliminated from the study. Control mice were treated identically but received PBS instead of pilocarpine. To determine the effects of transgene expression on numbers of degenerating neurons, 5–10 mice per group following various seizures were anesthetized 1 and 7 days after the seizures and perfused transcardially with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and washed, and 35-μm thick serial coronal sections were cut through the hippocampus. To quantify the levels of Aβ in brains of SwAPP mice after the seizures, mice (n = 5 per group) were perfused with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4), and brains, excluding cerebellum, were homogenized in lysis buffer. Passively immunized and control mice were analyzed by both ELISA and histochemistry. These mice were perfused transcardially with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4), and the frontal parts of the brains containing interaural regions 6–4 (46Franklin K.B.J. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar) of both hemispheres were homogenized in lysis buffer. The remaining brain tissue was fixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, washed several times in PBS, and processed for histochemistry. Sections were stained by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Gallyas silver impregnation protocols (47Gallyas F. Acta Morphol. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1971; 19: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar) to assess the degree of cell damage. Immunostaining was performed with an antibody against activated caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology) combined with anti-Aβ antibodies. Anti-Aβ antibodies used were 4G8 (Senetec), pan-Aβ, and anti-β-amyloid 40 (both from BIOSOURCE International) all giving similar results. Neither pan-Aβ nor anti-β-amyloid 40 antibodies cross-react with full-length APP (48Gouras G.K. Tsai J. Naslund J. Vincent B. Edgar M. Checler F. Greenfield J.P. Haroutunian V. Buxbaum J.D., Xu, H. Greengard P. Relkin N.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Adjacent sections were stained with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (Sigma and InnoGenex) and MAP-2 (Chemi-Con). Combined MAP-2 and Gallyas staining of same sections was done sequentially. 22C11 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 6E10 (Senetec) antibodies were used to determine the amounts of full-length APP in Western blots. The spatial patterns and the numbers of Aβ-positive and Gallyas-positive cells in each hippocampus were determined at 400× magnification in three standardized frontal adjacent sections, each 105 μm apart from the middle section at −1.70 mm posterior to bregma according to a sterological mouse brain atlas (46Franklin K.B.J. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Images were digitized by a CCD camera (Sony), and positive cells were counted by using the KAPPA ImageBase software (KAPPA opto-electronics, Gleichen, Germany). The average number of positive cells in each hippocampus was compared for each group and group means were compared statistically by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. For quantification of concentrations of SDS-soluble Aβ, we homogenized brain tissue in lysis buffer containing 2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 1× complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (49Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L. Saido T. Shoji M. Ashe K. Younkin S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatant fluids were collected after centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and were used to measure brain tissue levels of SDS-soluble Aβ. To exclude the presence of SDS-insoluble Aβ oligomers or fibrils, we extracted the pellets in a 20-fold wet weight amount of 70% formic acid, centrifuged at 200,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C, and neutralized the supernatant fluids by adding 20 volumes 1 m Tris base. Microtiter plates (Maxi sorb, Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 150 μl of monoclonal mouse antibody 22C4 directed against the C termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (amino acids 30–42) at a concentration of 20 μg/ml PBS. Plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% gelatin in 100 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.6) for 4 h at 37 °C and then washed three times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. 150 μl of diluted samples or serial dilution of standard (Aβ40, Bachem) in the above buffer was incubated overnight and washed, and bound Aβ was detected with biotinylated monoclonal mouse antibody 6H1 (Evotec) directed against amino acids 1–17 of human Aβ incubated at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in blocking buffer for 4 h at 37 °C and visualized with a peroxidase reaction using tetramethylbenzidine as substrate at 450 nm. The linear range (r2 ≤ 0.99) of the used ELISA system was between 2.5–100 ng Aβ/ml. Serial dilutions of samples were used for measurements in the linear range. In parallel, the concentration of Aβ42 in each sample was determined using a commercially available kit (Innogenics) according to the provider’s instructions. Passive immunization was done by intravenous injections of an Aβ-specific monoclonal antibody into the tail vein. SwAPP mice were immunized by injections of 22C4 antibody, 9 mg/kg body weight, diluted in sterile PBS (pH 7.4) (n = 5). Injections were carried out every 5 days beginning at 6 weeks of age. Each mouse received a total of four injections. Severe seizures were induced 1 day after the last injection, and mice were analyzed 7 days later. Control groups comprised of non-tg (n = 5) and SwAPP mice (n = 5) that had received intravenous PBS injections instead of antibodies and that had undergone identical seizures. Data were collected by investigators blinded to the treatment and genotype of the mice and were analyzed by non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests. In all graphs, means ± S.E. are shown, and asterisks indicate statistically significant differences. Seven days after seizures, many hippocampal pyramidal cells were stained by both Gallyas silver impregnation and TUNEL, whereas no stained neurons were present in the not-seizured control mice (Fig.1A). In general, the spatial distribution of Gallyas- and TUNEL-positive neurons were similar. Quantitative analysis of Gallyas-positive cells in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions revealed that their numbers increased with seizure severity and with post-seizure time and were consistently higher in the SwAPP mice with the maximum numbers of positive cells in both groups at 7 days after the seizures (Fig. 1B). For both genotypes, cell death started in the medial part of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The lateral portion of the CA1 and the CA3 region of non-tg mice were unaffected 1 day after severe seizures, whereas in SwAPP mice severe seizures caused significant numbers of degenerating cells in these regions (Fig. 1C). In addition, neurons in the amygdala and in the striatum were heavily affected by the seizures in SwAPP but not in non-tg mice (Fig. 1D). The time of onset of seizures following the pilocarpine injections did not differ in SwAPP and non-transgenic littermates. No Gallyas- or TUNEL-positive cells were found in corresponding areas of control mice that had been injected with PBS instead of pilocarpine and had not undergone seizures (Fig. 1, A and D). Reactive astroglyosis was higher in both SwAPP and non-tg mice after the seizures when compared with not-seizured controls. Dense glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes populated areas of degenerating neurons, and the extent of astrogliosis correlated with the degree of cell loss (Fig. 1E). In contrast to SwAPP mice, little astrogliosis was found in amygdala of non-tg mice 7 days after severe seizures (Fig. 1E), paralleling the very little degeneration in this region in non-tg mice (Fig. 1D). Total Aβ levels in brains of SwAPP mice were measured 1 and 7 days after severe seizures. One day after the seizures, the levels of transgenic total Aβ in brains of SwAPP mice were not significantly different from control not-seizured SwAPP littermates that had undergone the same treatment but received PBS instead of pilocarpine. However, this level was 2-fold higher 7 days after the seizures (Fig. 2A), possibly due to the accumulation of Aβ-positive cells in hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum of these mice (Fig. 1, A, B, and D). Western blotting with anti-APP antibodies 6E10 and 22C11 revealed no consistent changes in the amount of full-length APP following the seizures (not shown). Cells in areas with TUNEL-positive neurons showed high immunoreactivity for Aβ using the 4G8 (Fig. 2B), pan-Aβ and anti-Aβ-amyloid 40 antibodies. No Aβ was detectable in neurons of mice that had not undergone seizures (Fig. 2B). Double immunostaining revealed that Aβ-positive cells were also stained with an antibody that detects the activated pro-apoptotic form of caspase-3 (Fig.2B). To determine whether the higher vulnerability of SwAPP neurons to seizures was mediated by increased tissue levels of Aβ, we passively immunized SwAPP mice by intravenous injections of Aβ-specific antibodies. The 22C4 monoclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the C termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42, was used for passive immunization. Again, the time of onset of seizures did not vary between antibody-treated SwAPP mice (SwAPP/22C4) and control mice that had received intravenous injections of PBS (SwAPP/PBS). SwAPP/PBS and SwAPP/22C4 mice seized within 27 ± 10 and 26 ± 13 min after pilocarpine injections, respectively (means ± S.D.). The passive immunization protocol reduced significantly the brain levels of total Aβ and amyloidogenic Aβ42 (Fig.3A). After SDS extraction, no formic acid-extractable Aβ could be detected in the SDS-insoluble pellets, indicating that brain Aβ in our mice was SDS-soluble at the age of 10 weeks, i.e. at the end of these experiments. Importantly, passive immunization significantly reduced the numbers of seizure-induced degenerating cells in the hippocampus (Fig. 3B). The number of degenerating cells in passively immunized SwAPP mice did not differ from the corresponding number of the not-immunized non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 3B). To evaluate the role of intracellular Aβ accumulation in degenerating cells, the number of Aβ-positive cells was quantified in adjacent sections. The number of Aβ-positive neurons was significantly higher in SwAPP mice when compared with non-tg littermates. Passive immunization with the monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody 22C4 significantly reduced this number to the number observed in non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 3C). The results of this study show that brain neurons of mice expressing SwAPP are more vulnerable to seizure-induced damage than their non-tg littermates and that passive immunization against Aβ reduced this vulnerability. Importantly, the transgenic expression of SwAPP did not affect the seizure threshold indicated by identical time intervals between the pilocarpine injection and initial signs of seizures, by identical doses of pilocarpine used, and by identical presentations of seizure severity in both genotype groups. Because both genetic backgrounds and seizure phenotypes of mice were identical and because the duration of the seizure was kept constant by terminating the seizures with diazepam, the observed differences in the susceptibility of brain neurons to damage were related to the expression of the SwAPP transgene. The Gallyas protocol was shown to selectively detect degenerating neurons in many pathogenic conditions including kainate-induced apoptotic cell death in hippocampal neurons after ischemic lesions or progressive motor neuron disease (50Teuchert-Noodt G. Breuker K.H. Dawirs R.R. Dev. Neurosci. 1991; 13: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 51Pollard H. Charriaut-Marlangue C. Cantagrel S. Represa A. Robain O. Moreau J. Ben-Ari Y.

In general, the SwAPP neurons were more vulnerable to pilocarpine-induced seizures as compared with their non-transgenic littermates. One day after the seizures, the medial part of the CA1 region was labeled by the Gallyas stain in all groups, whereas neurons within the lateral CA1 region were stained only in SwAPP but not in non-tg control mice. In non-tg mice these neurons became Gallyas-positive 7 days after severe seizures. Substantial numbers of Gallyas-positive cells occurred also in the amygdala and the striatum of the SwAPP but not non-tg mice, indicating that transgenic expression of the SwAPP mutation increased the vulnerability of neurons within hippocampus, the amygdala, and the striatum. In addition, seizures caused intracellular accumulations of Aβ in affected neurons throughout the brain. This increase was associated with activated caspase-3. Together with increased TUNEL stains, the activation of caspase-3 clearly suggest that intracellular Aβ was associated with apoptotic cell degeneration that led to the staining of these cells by the Gallyas silver impregnation protocol. Passive immunization of mice for 3 weeks with a monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody reduced both total Aβ and Aβ42 in brain tissue and protected neurons against seizure-induced cell damage. All existing forms of Aβ in the 10-week-old mice examined here were SDS-soluble; there was no Aβ in formic acid extracts of SDS-insoluble pellets. The pool of SDS-insoluble Aβ may well contain monomers as well as higher molecular mass oligomers (14Lue L.F. Kuo Y.M. Roher A.E. Brachova L. Shen Y. Sue L. Beach T. Kurth J.H. Rydel R.E. Rogers J.

Therefore, these data suggest a crucial role of SDS-soluble Aβ in the vulnerability to toxic events that occur during and after seizures and demonstrates that antibodies against Aβ can have neuroprotective activities. Because the numbers of damaged cells in the 22C4-immunized SwAPP mice were reduced to the corresponding levels in non-tg mice, passive immunization essentially blocked the increased vulnerability caused by SwAPP mutation. Our data suggest that intracellular Aβ was involved in this neurodegeneration because the number of Aβ-positive cells correlated to the number of Gallyas-positive cells in adjacent sections and passive immunization with 22C4 also reduced the number of Aβ-positive cells, again in correlation with the number of Gallyas-positive cells in adjacent sections. Both ELISAs used in this study selectively detected human but not mouse Aβ; therefore, we were unable to measure whether the mouse Aβ was decreased in response to passive immunization. Because the 22C4 antibody recognizes specifically the C termini of Aβ40 and Aβ42, our data strongly suggest that the reduction of Aβ levels in brain by passive immunization was associated with the reduced vulnerability of neurons to external noxious stress. Another theoretical possibility is that Aβ antibodies bind to Aβ-containing derivatives, thereby blocking potential toxic functions of these proteins. Importantly, no amyloid plaques and no formic acid-extractable amyloid fibrils were present in these mice, strongly suggesting an SwAPP-related toxic event that is unrelated to amyloid plaque deposits. If SDS-soluble Aβ is toxic in vivo, it may link the expression of SwAPP transgene to increased neuronal vulnerability. This data is consistent with behavioral deficits in transgenic mice with high brain levels of Aβ before the onset of amyloid plaque formation (30Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R.

Our data demonstrate that the combination of two pathogenic factors, the neuronal expression of an AD-causing mutant APP along with additional excitotoxicity caused by seizures, resulted in additive toxic effects and accelerated neurodegeneration. Because lowering Aβ by passive immunization blocked the SwAPP-related increased vulnerability and protected neurons from seizure-induced degeneration, it may have therapeutic potential for AD.

Hsiao (University of Minnesota) for providing SwAPP mice, Dr. John Pohlner (Evotec NeuroSciences) for Aβ antibodies, Hong Li, Marijana Stagljar, and Eva Moritz for excellent technical help, and Jay Tracy for critically reading this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2045470441,"Induction of differentiation of HL-60 human myeloid cells profoundly affected expression of calreticulin, a Ca2+-binding endoplasmic reticulum chaperone. Induction with Me2SO or retinoic acid reduced levels of calreticulin protein by ∼60% within 4 days. Pulse-chase studies indicated that labeled calreticulin decayed at similar rates in differentiated and undifferentiated cells (t12∼4.6 days), but the biosynthetic rate was <10% of control after 4 days. Differentiation also induced a rapid decline in calreticulin mRNA levels (90% reduction after 1 day) without a decrease in transcript stability (t12 ∼5 h). Nuclear run-on analysis demonstrated rapid down-regulation of gene transcription (21% of control at 2 h). Differentiation also greatly reduced the Ca2+ content of the cells (25% of control), although residual Ca2+ pools remained sensitive to thapsigargin, ionomycin, and inositol trisphosphate. Progressive decreases were also observed in levels of calnexin and ERp57, whereas BiP/GRP78 and protein disulfide isomerase were only modestly affected. Ultrastructural studies showed a substantial reduction in endoplasmic reticulum content of the cells. Thus, terminal differentiation of myeloid cells was associated with decreased endoplasmic reticulum content, selective reductions in molecular chaperones, and diminished intracellular Ca2+ stores, perhaps reflecting an endoplasmic reticulum remodeling program as a prominent feature of granulocytic differentiation.

Thus, terminal differentiation of myeloid cells was associated with decreased endoplasmic reticulum content, selective reductions in molecular chaperones, and diminished intracellular Ca2+ stores, perhaps reflecting an endoplasmic reticulum remodeling program as a prominent feature of granulocytic differentiation. endoplasmic reticulum inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate 2,3, types 1, 2, and 3 receptors for IP3 non-fat dry milk phosphate-buffered saline phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase Calreticulin is a major Ca2+-binding protein present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 of virtually all cell types (1Krause K.-H.

The cDNA sequence predicts an ∼47-kDa acidic protein with a zonal structure featuring a globular N-terminal domain, a proline-rich P domain, and a highly acidic C domain terminating in a KDEL motif, the ER retention signal (3Michalak M.

Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 11-30Crossref Google Scholar). Biophysical studies show calreticulin to be a highly asymmetric molecule consistent with this predicted three domain structure. Calreticulin binds Ca2+with both high and low affinities and with high capacity. A single high affinity site (Kd ∼1 μm) is located within the P domain of the molecule and multiple low affinity sites (Kd ∼2 mm, 20–25 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein) are present in the highly acidic C domain (3Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 4Baksh S. Michalak M. Michalak M. Calreticulin. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 11-30Crossref Google Scholar). The N domain contains at least one site for binding Zn2+, which appears to involve 4 of the histidine residues in this region (5Baksh S.

Binding of these ions affects the conformation and stability of the protein (7Corbett E.F. Michalak K.M. Oikawa K. Johnson S. Campbell I.D. Eggleton P. Kay C. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27177-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Numerous and apparently unrelated functions have been ascribed to calreticulin since it was first identified, but its roles in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and as a molecular chaperone of nascent glycoproteins are the two functions that have been most extensively characterized. Calreticulin appears to regulate intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis through more than one mechanism. The high Ca2+-binding capacity of calreticulin suggests that it acts as a Ca2+ store or buffer within the ER, and there is evidence that in at least some cell types it is a main source of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-releasable Ca2+ (3Michalak M.

In support of these observations, overexpression of calreticulin in some cells is accompanied by a significant increase in the Ca2+ storage pool, as well as an alteration in IP3-mediated Ca2+ release and influx (9Mery L. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9332-9339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Xu W. Longo F.J. Wintermantel M.R.

Moreover, the thapsigargin- and ionomycin-sensitive Ca2+ pools were markedly reduced in calreticulin-null mouse embryonic stem cells, defects that were corrected by ectopic expression of calreticulin (11Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S. Lynch J. Ahsan I. Krause R. Papp S., De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Müller-Esterl W. Lew D.P. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. Opas M. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In contrast, calreticulin-deficient murine embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts exhibited normal levels of IP3-releasable Ca2+ (12Coppolino M.G. Woodside M.J. Demaurex N. Grinstein S., St- Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), suggesting that dependence of Ca2+ release on calreticulin may vary among cell types and signaling pathways. Calreticulin may also regulate Ca2+ levels by direct interaction with the ER uptake mechanism. Luminal Ca2+ released into the cytosol through the IP3 receptor channel is taken back up into the ER by the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCA). One isoform of this family of Ca2+ pumps (SERCA2b) has an additional transmembrane segment and a C-terminal domain that extends into the lumen of the ER and contains a putative N-glycosylation site. In elegant studies using the Xenopus oocyte model, Camacho and colleagues (13Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Cell. 1995; 82: 765-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14John L.M. Lechleiter J.D. Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) showed that calreticulin inhibited the activity of SERCA2b and altered the temporal and spatial patterns of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release. This activity was dependent on Ca2+ concentration and was mediated by the lectin-binding P domain of calreticulin, rather than its high capacity Ca2+-binding C domain. Thus, calreticulin may modulate agonist-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization through multiple pathways.In addition to its role in Ca2+ signaling, calreticulin has an important function as a lectin-like chaperone for newly synthesized glycoproteins (3Michalak M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In this respect, it displays many features in common with calnexin, another ER molecular chaperone. Calnexin and calreticulin share regions of structural homology and show lectin-like selectivity for mono-glucosylated N-linked glycoproteins (16Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F.

The two proteins differ in topography; calreticulin is a soluble luminal ER protein, and calnexin has a transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic domain. The interactions of calreticulin with unfolded glycoproteins and with other ER chaperones are Ca2+-dependent, suggesting a potential functional link between the chaperone and Ca2+-modulating roles of calreticulin (6Baksh S.

Moreover, the 5′-flanking sequence of the calreticulin gene and the genes for the chaperone proteins BiP/GRP78 and GRP94 show regions of sequence homology, suggesting that they are coordinately regulated (22McCauliffe D.P. Yang Y.-S. Wilson J. Sontheimer R.D. Capra J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In phagocytic leukocytes, calreticulin serves several important functions. It acts as a molecular chaperone for the enzyme myeloperoxidase (15Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a catalytic component of oxygen-dependent microbicidal systems. In addition, membranous structures containing calreticulin, as well as the Ca2+-ATPase SERCA2b, accumulate in the actin-rich filamentous regions surrounding developing phagocytic vacuoles (23Stendahl O. Krause K.-H. Krischer J. Jerström P. Theler J.-M. Clark R.A. Carpentier J.-L. Lew D.P. Science. 1994; 265: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting involvement of these vesicles in the modulation of Ca2+-dependent phagolysosomal functions. Calreticulin has also been reported to be released from activated neutrophils (24Kishore U. Sontheimer R.D. Sastry K.N. Zaner K.S. Zappi E.G. Hughes G.R.V. Khamashta M.A. Strong P. Reid K.B.M.

Johnson S. Ward F.J. Reid K.B. Eggleton P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17865-17874Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A recent report (26Ogden C.A. DeCathehneau A. Hoffmann P.R. Bratton D. Ghebrehiwet B. Fadok V.A. Henson P.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) demonstrates that C1q-calreticulin interactions are involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells by phagocytes.Because of its importance in the biology and function of myeloid cells, we have investigated the biosynthesis and regulation of calreticulin in this cell type. Our previous studies (27Denning G.M. Leidal K.G. Holst V.A. Iyer S.S. Pearson D.W. Clark J.R. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the biosynthesis and post-translational processing of calreticulin in the HL-60 and PLB-985 myeloid cell lines showed that the primary translation product undergoes co-translational signal peptide cleavage and post-translational N-linked glycosylation to form the mature molecule. In the current study, we have investigated the transcription and translation of calreticulin and characterized the mechanisms of the dramatic down-regulation of its expression during in vitroinduction of myeloid cell differentiation.RESULTSInduction of Differentiation Reduces the Level and Biosynthetic Rate of Calreticulin ProteinProtein LevelMe2SO induces granulocytic differentiation of myeloid cell lines (29Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 149: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of differentiation on calreticulin protein level, HL-60 cells were incubated for 4 days in complete medium supplemented with 1.25% Me2SO; aliquots were removed at 0, 2, and 4 days, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with monospecific rabbit anti-human calreticulin (27Denning G.M. Leidal K.G. Holst V.A. Iyer S.S. Pearson D.W. Clark J.R. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 372-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cell calreticulin protein levels decreased over time (Fig. 1A), with quantitative analysis of 5 independent experiments (Fig.1A, table inset) indicating more than a 50% decline at 4 days. In a separate experiment, five different sets of HL-60 cells were analyzed in parallel at 0 and 4 days after Me2SO addition (Fig. 1B). There was a consistent decrease in calreticulin levels to a mean of 38.8% (±3.7, p < 0.001) of the zero time controls.Protein Catabolic RatePossible mechanisms that could account for the observed decreases in steady-state calreticulin levels accompanying the induction of differentiation were an increase in the catabolic rate or a decrease in the biosynthetic rate. To determine whether differentiation influenced the rate of disappearance of calreticulin, undifferentiated and 4-day Me2SO-induced HL-60 cells were metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then chased in fresh complete medium with unlabeled methionine for up to 7 days. For the Me2SO-induced cells, the chase medium included Me2SO, although essentially similar results were obtained if Me2SO was omitted from the chase medium. Fixed volume aliquots of the cultures were removed at intervals for cell centrifugation, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Following densitometry and normalization to the corresponding levels obtained immediately after labeling (Fig.2), we determined that labeled calreticulin in the undifferentiated and Me2SO-treated cells decayed at approximately equal rates during the chase period. The calculated calreticulin t12 for untreated cells was 4.5 days and for Me2SO-treated cells was 4.6 days. Thus, an increased rate of loss of calreticulin does not appear to contribute to the reduction of cellular levels of calreticulin observed during HL-60 cell differentiation. An interesting feature of this experiment was the unusually high stability of calreticulin. Our data suggest a fractional catabolic rate in HL-60 myeloid cells of only about 13% per day. In additional experiments, we determined both cell-associated and extracellular 35S-calreticulin. The results indicated that release of calreticulin from the cells contributed only modestly to cellular calreticulin homeostasis (<20%) under our experimental conditions (data not shown).FIG. 2Analysis of the catabolic rate of calreticulin by pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation.HL-60 cells were cultured for 4 days in the presence or absence of Me2SO as in Fig. 1. They were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then chased in fresh complete medium with unlabeled methionine for 7 days, and aliquots were removed at intervals, as indicated, for immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Each lane contained the immunoprecipitate from cells that were pelleted from a fixed volume aliquot of the culture, thereby avoiding the potentially confounding effect of35S-calreticulin dilution during cell division. The content of calreticulin at each point is indicated as a percent of the zero time value, based on densitometric quantitation. The half-life of calreticulin by this method was 4.5 or 4.6 days for untreated or Me2SO-treated cells, respectively. The study shown is representative of three independent experiments. CRT,calreticulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Protein Biosynthetic RateIn view of the lack of any change in the catabolism of calreticulin to account for its decreased levels in differentiated cells, we next investigated whether the biosynthetic rate was changed in response to Me2SO-induced differentiation. Parallel experiments were also carried out with other differentiating agents. Thus, HL-60 cells were cultured in Me2SO or retinoic acid to induce granulocytic differentiation or in PMA or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to induce monocytic differentiation. At intervals, aliquots of cells were taken for biosynthetic pulse labeling with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3). Induction of differentiation by each agent decreased the amount of nascent calreticulin labeled with [35S]methionine, indicating reductions in the biosynthetic rate. Similar results were observed in studies on PLB-985 cells (data not shown). The effect was progressive over time and showed differences in rate and extent with the various differentiating agents. Initially, the effect was most rapid in the Me2SO-treated cells, which exhibited a reduction of calreticulin synthesis to 36% of zero time levels after only 1 day of treatment. In 4 replicate experiments, the mean normalized values for calreticulin biosynthesis rates (relative to zero time controls) after 1, 2, 4, and 6 days of culture in Me2SO were 44.2 (p < 0.05), 33.8 (p < 0.01), 9.5 (p < 0.001), and 2.0% (p < 0.001), respectively. These experiments clearly indicate that the reduction in calreticulin protein levels observed during differentiation of myeloid cells resulted largely from a major decrease in the rate of calreticulin biosynthesis.FIG. 3Analysis of biosynthetic rate of calreticulin by pulse labeling and immunoprecipitation. HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate by growth in 1.25% Me2SO, 1 μm retinoic acid (RA), 80 nm PMA, or 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3((OH)2D3). Aliquots were taken initially and after 1, 2, 4, and 6 days for pulse labeling ([35S]methionine for 30 min), immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Each lane contained the immunoprecipitate from 4 × 106 cells. The relative biosynthetic rate of calreticulin at each point is indicated as a percent of the 0 time value, based on densitometric quantitation. The study shown for Me2SO is representative of four independent experiments, whereas the other differentiating agents were studied in one experiment each.

To determine the effect of myeloid cell differentiation on calreticulin mRNA levels, Northern analysis was carried out on the poly(A)+ RNA from cells induced to differentiate (Fig.4). Calreticulin mRNA was highly expressed in untreated cells but was markedly reduced in both HL-60 and PLB-985 cells within 1 day of Me2SO treatment, and further reduction was seen after 2 days (Fig. 4A). Following normalization to the levels of β-actin mRNA, it was estimated that Me2SO treatment induced an approximate 80% reduction in the level of calreticulin transcripts within 1 day. In 6 replicate experiments, the mean normalized values for calreticulin message levels (relative to zero time controls) after 1, 2, and 4 days of culture in Me2SO were 19.6, 16.2, and 9.1%, respectively (p < 0.001 for each).FIG. 4Northern hybridization analysis of calreticulin transcript levels during myeloid cell differentiation.A, HL-60 or PLB-985 cells were cultured in the presence of 1.25% Me2SO for 0, 1, or 2 days, as indicated. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated, separated (3 μg/lane) on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred, and probed for calreticulin mRNA, followed by stripping and probing for β-actin, which was used as a loading control. After densitometric quantitation, the content of calreticulin transcripts was corrected for actin and expressed as a percent of the zero time values. The studies shown are representative of five independent experiments for HL-60 cells and two experiments for PLB-985 cells. B, HL-60 cells were cultured and analyzed as in A, except that the blots were also probed for p47phox and p67phox. The data for calreticulin mRNA levels are expressed in the same fashion as above. The study shown is representative of two independent experiments. C, HL-60 cells were cultured and analyzed as inA, except that differentiation was induced with either Me2SO (Me) or retinoic acid (R) for 1 or 3 days, as indicated, and the blots were also probed for type 1 IP3 receptor (IP3R). The data for calreticulin and IP3R mRNA levels are expressed in the same fashion as above. The study shown is representative of two independent experiments. CRT, calreticulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Differentiation of HL-60 and PLB-985 cells is accompanied by the induction of a number of myeloid-specific genes, the products of which carry out essential functions in the terminally differentiated granulocytic cell. Two such genes are p47phox and p67phox, cytosolic components of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (35Gupta J.W. Kubin M. Hartman L. Cassatella M. Trinchieri G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2530-2537PubMed Google Scholar). To place the differentiation-induced changes in calreticulin mRNA in context, they were compared with those for p47phoxand p67phox in HL-60 cells treated with Me2SO (Fig.4B). The cellular level of calreticulin mRNA was again rapidly reduced, whereas the p47phox and p67phoxtranscripts increased from undetectable levels in untreated cells to maximal expression after 2–4 days of Me2SO treatment. Parallel studies were done comparing calreticulin with the type 1 IP3 receptor, a protein that, like calreticulin, is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in calcium release (Fig. 4C). We observed that both Me2SO and retinoic acid induced a 3–4-fold increase in IP3R mRNA within 1 day of treatment, whereas calreticulin mRNA was again significantly reduced.The detailed kinetics of the effects of various inducing agents on calreticulin mRNA expression in HL-60 cells were examined in a slot-blot hybridization assay. RNA was isolated from the cells at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 h after initiation of treatment and probed for calreticulin and β-actin. After scanning densitometry, calreticulin mRNA was normalized to β-actin levels, and results were expressed as a percentage of the initial value (Fig.5). Me2SO treatment produced the most rapid reduction (50% in ∼5 h) of calreticulin mRNA (as was observed for protein synthetic rates, see Fig. 3). Retinoic acid and PMA were also very active, reducing the mRNA levels by 50% in ∼10 h, whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was less active in down-regulation of calreticulin transcripts (50% reduction in ∼25–30 h).FIG. 5Time course of calreticulin transcript levels during HL-60 cell differentiation. HL-60 cells were cultured in the various differentiating agents as indicated, and aliquots were removed at the times shown. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated and analyzed by slot-blot hybridization with a calreticulin probe, following which the blots were stripped and probed for β-actin, which was used a loading control. After densitometric quantitation, the content of calreticulin transcripts was corrected for actin and expressed as a percent of the zero time values. The results shown are from a single study, which is representative of two independent experiments. CRT, calreticulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Transcript StabilityPossible mechanisms that could account for the observed decreases in steady-state levels of calreticulin transcripts accompanying the induction of differentiation were a decrease in transcript stability (i.e. an increase in the catabolic rate) or a decrease in the transcriptional rate. To determine whether calreticulin mRNA stability was affected by Me2SO treatment, studies were carried out using actinomycin D as an inhibitor of transcription. HL-60 cells were cultured in Me2SO for 0, 1, or 2 days and then incubated in fresh medium; actinomycin D was added at various times up to 6 h (see “Experimental Procedures”). At the end of these incubations, poly(A)+ RNA was extracted, and slot-blot hybridization analyses were carried out. Levels of calreticulin and β-actin mRNA were expressed as a percentage of the levels at 0 time, and t12 was calculated from these values. Because thet12 averaged between 3 and 5 h, analysis focused especially on the 4-h time point. Treatment of the cells with Me2SO resulted in significant and similar increases in the normalized 4-h transcript levels for both calreticulin and actin (Table I). In keeping with this, the calculatedt12 values for both calreticulin and actin transcripts were increased by ∼50% (Table I), indicating stabilization of these mRNAs in Me2SO-induced HL-60 cells. Thus, the down-regulation of calreticulin mRNA in differentiating HL-60 cells could not be explained by increased transcript catabolism. Indeed, enhanced mRNA stability provided some counter-balance to decreased transcription (see below).Table IStability of calreticulin mRNA in undifferentiated and Me2SO-induced HL-60 cellsTime in Me2SOTranscript level (4 h after actinomycin D)t1/2CalreticulinActinCalreticulinActindays%h027.3 ± 3.91-aPercent of control; mean ± S.E. for a total of 4–6 independent experiments.35.4 ± 9.83.1 ± 0.21-bMean ± S.E. for a total of 4–6 independent experiments.3.3 ± 0.4160.5 ± 5.038.8 ± 10.34.7 ± 0.53.5 ± 0.2262.9 ± 6.657.4 ± 21.55.0 ± 0.64.8 ± 0.71-a Percent of control; mean ± S.E. for a total of 4–6 independent experiments.1-b Mean ± S.E. for a total of 4–6 independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Transcriptional RateTo determine whether reduction in the rate of gene transcription was responsible for the rapid down-regulation of calreticulin mRNA in differentiating HL-60 cells, nuclear run-on analyses were carried out on undifferentiated and Me2SO-induced cells. As illustrated in the left-hand panel of Fig. 6, transcription of the calreticulin gene was essentially eliminated following 96 h of Me2SO treatment, as was transcription of myeloperoxidase, another gene that is down-regulated in differentiation-induced HL-60 cells. In the same cells, the transcription of the internal control β-actin remained largely unchanged, whereas transcription of p47phox was undetectable initially but was strongly induced at 96 h. To determine more precisely the period during which calreticulin transcription was affected, nuclear run-on analysis was carried out at shorter intervals after initiation of Me2SO treatment. These studies (Fig. 6, right-hand panel) showed that calreticulin gene transcription was down-regulated very rapidly after Me2SO exposure (79% decrease in 2 h). Myeloperoxidase transcription appeared to be reduced even more"
https://openalex.org/W2138507661,"The influence of estrogen on the development of the male reproductive system may be interrupted in a subset of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) patients. PAIS describes a wide range of male undermasculinization resulting from mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) or steroid metabolism enzymes that perturb androgen-AR regulation of male sex organ development. In this study, we are interested in determining if PAIS-derived AR mutants that respond normally to androgen have altered responses to estrogen in the presence of ARA70, a coregulator previously shown to enhance 17β-estradiol E2-induced AR transactivation. The wild-type AR (wtAR) and two PAIS AR mutants, AR(S703G) and AR(E709K), all bind to androgen and E2 and subsequently translocate to the nucleus. Whereas ARA70 functionally interacts with the wtAR and the PAIS AR mutants in response to androgen, E2 only promotes the functional interaction between ARA70 and the wtAR but not the PAIS AR mutants. ARA70 increases E2 competitive binding to the wtAR in the presence of low level androgen and also retards E2 dissociation from the wtAR. ARA70 is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of various mouse testicular cells during early embryogenesis day 16, at postpartum day 0 during estradiol synthesis and in the Leydig cells at postpartum day 49. ARA70 may be unable to modulate the PAIS AR mutants-E2 binding, diminishing the effect of E2 via AR during male reproductive system development in patients with such mutations. Therefore, the presence of ARA70 in the testosterone and E2-producing Leydig cells may enhance the overall activity of AR during critical stages of male sex organ development. The influence of estrogen on the development of the male reproductive system may be interrupted in a subset of partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) patients. PAIS describes a wide range of male undermasculinization resulting from mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) or steroid metabolism enzymes that perturb androgen-AR regulation of male sex organ development. In this study, we are interested in determining if PAIS-derived AR mutants that respond normally to androgen have altered responses to estrogen in the presence of ARA70, a coregulator previously shown to enhance 17β-estradiol E2-induced AR transactivation. The wild-type AR (wtAR) and two PAIS AR mutants, AR(S703G) and AR(E709K), all bind to androgen and E2 and subsequently translocate to the nucleus. Whereas ARA70 functionally interacts with the wtAR and the PAIS AR mutants in response to androgen, E2 only promotes the functional interaction between ARA70 and the wtAR but not the PAIS AR mutants. ARA70 increases E2 competitive binding to the wtAR in the presence of low level androgen and also retards E2 dissociation from the wtAR. ARA70 is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of various mouse testicular cells during early embryogenesis day 16, at postpartum day 0 during estradiol synthesis and in the Leydig cells at postpartum day 49. ARA70 may be unable to modulate the PAIS AR mutants-E2 binding, diminishing the effect of E2 via AR during male reproductive system development in patients with such mutations. Therefore, the presence of ARA70 in the testosterone and E2-producing Leydig cells may enhance the overall activity of AR during critical stages of male sex organ development. androgen receptor partial androgen insensitivity 17β-estradiol wild-type AR ligand-binding domain chloramphenicol acetyltransferase phosphate-buffered saline 5α-dihydrotestosterone estrogen receptor glucocorticoid receptor progesterone receptor P0, postpartum day 0 Androgen action via the androgen receptor (AR)1 is critical in regulating male reproductive system development (1Quigley C.A., De Bellis A.

Insufficient androgen action may cause androgen insensitivity syndrome or male undermasculinized genitalia (2Nitsche E.M. Hiort O. Horm. Res. 2000; 54: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The androgen insensitivity phenotypes vary from external genitalia that are completely female to degrees of partial masculinization. The possible causes may range from mutations in the AR or 5α-reductase genes to abnormal levels of estrogenversus androgen. Although partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS)-associated AR mutations usually disrupt the response to androgen, a subset of patients have AR mutations without any apparent defect in androgen signaling (3Radmayr C.

Mutat. 1999; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Estrogen, primarily 17β-estradiol (E2), has also been proposed to be involved in both normal and abnormal processes of male reproductive development and associated diseases (5Cunha G.R.

Cunha G.R. Risbridger G.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Male estrogen is synthesized by aromatization of androgen, (e.g.testosterone), in many tissues including brain, liver, adipose tissue, and prostate (5Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Cooke P.S. Mee S. Bigsby R.M. Higgins S.J. Sugimura Y. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 338-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The physiological level of circulating E2 in the adult male is ∼0.1 nm (73–184 pmol/liter or 12–34 pg/ml), and in the adult female during pregnancy, the level of E2 is ∼1 nm (367–1285 pmol/liter or 100–350 pg/ml) (7Tanagho E.A. McAninch J.W. Smith's General Urology. 15th Ed. Lange Medical Books McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 813Google Scholar). However, local aromatase activity may cause particular tissue levels of E2 to be higher than the serum level. During pregnancy, maternal exposure to exogenous estrogen may influence the sexual maturation of male offspring, leading to cryptorchidism, epididymal cysts, and retained Mullerian ducts (8Rajfer J. Coffey D.S. Invest. Urol. 1978; 16: 186-190PubMed Google Scholar). Although estrogen action on the male reproductive system is not well understood, there is evidence of an estrogen-imprinting effect that may induce prostatic hyperplasia in male offspring with excess prenatal exposure to estrogen (9Prins G.S. Birch L. Couse J.F. Choi I. Katzenellenbogen B. Korach K.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6089-6097PubMed Google Scholar).Based on reports using CV-1 (10Kemppainen J.A Lane M.V Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Receptor. 1991; 1: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar) cells, it is possible that estrogen may influence male reproductive system development via the AR. Our previous report (13Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) demonstrated that E2-mediated wild-type AR (wtAR) transactivation is enhanced by the addition of the AR coregulator, ARA70, in DU145 cells. In HeLa cells, although E2 could promote the translocation of the wtAR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, E2 requires selective coregulators, such as ARA70 or SRC-1, to significantly induce the wtAR transactivation (14Agoulnik, I., Stenoien, D., Mancini, M. A., and Weigel, N. (2000) in Keystone Steroid Symposium, Boulder, Colorado, March 28, Abstr. 302, Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute and The Directors Sponsor Fund.Google Scholar). In PC-3 (15Han G.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and TSU-Pr1 (17Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar) cells, ARA70 and β-catenin also dramatically enhance wtAR transactivation in response to E2, although there are conflicting results in CV-1 cells (16Zhou Z.X., He, B. Hall S.H. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Gao T. Brantley K. Bolu E. McPhaul M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The differing results in CV-1 cells may reflect differences in cell passage number, growth conditions, or expression vectors. Therefore, certain coregulators may enable estrogen to influence AR target gene expression via the AR and thereby potentially contribute to male sexual maturation. Furthermore, there is evidence that the disruption of coactivators may also contribute to hormone resistance during target organ development (19Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 20Adachi M. Takayanagi R. Tomura A. Imasaki K. Kato S. Goto K. Yanase T. Ikuyama S. Nawata H. N. Engl. J.

Thus, certain PAIS-associated AR mutations may disrupt this estrogen-dependent AR transactivation, which is modulated by coregulators, during male reproductive system development.Here we have analyzed the functional interaction of PAIS-derived AR mutants with ARA70 in response to androgen or E2. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays, we demonstrate that E2 promotes the interaction of ARA70 with the wtAR but not with the PAIS mutants. By various ligand binding analyses, we also demonstrate that ARA70 increases the E2 competitive binding to the wtAR at the low levels of androgen and retards the dissociation of E2 from the wtAR-LBD but not from the PAIS mutants. ARA70 is present in various fetal mouse testicular cells during early embryogenesis day 16 and postpartum day 0 and is also significantly present in the Leydig cells at postpartum day 49. ARA70 may therefore be unable to stabilize the binding of E2 to the PAIS AR mutants, diminishing the effect of E2 via the AR during male reproductive system development in these patients.DISCUSSIONAndrogen insensitivity syndrome is characterized by a spectrum of deficient male virilization or undermasculinization including testicular feminization (29Felig P. Frohman L.A. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 779-824Google Scholar). It is known that if androgen action is slightly less than optimal, there will be undervirilization or inefficient spermatogenesis (29Felig P. Frohman L.A. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 779-824Google Scholar). Although mutation of the AR is often found in PAIS patients, certain mutations associated with PAIS respond normally to androgen (4Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The first mutation analyzed in this study, AR(S703G), was identified in a patient diagnosed with male pseudohermaphroditism, which is associated with PAIS (3Radmayr C. Culig Z. Glatzl J. Neuschmid-Kaspar F. Bartsch G. Klocker H. J. Urol. 1997; 158: 1553-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The other mutation we studied, AR(E709K), is associated with Reifenstein syndrome (13Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Reifenstein syndrome is a less severe variant of X-linked PAIS in which affected individuals present as phenotypic males with hypospadias, inadequate pubertal virilization, gynecomastia, and infertility (30Aima J. Griffin J.E. Gazak J.M. Wilson J.D. MacDonald P.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 300: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 show that both of these PAIS mutants respond to androgen normally, but have lost the ARA70-dependent response to E2. Although E2 is a nonspecific ligand for the wtAR, certain coregulators, such as ARA70 or SRC-1, can enhance wtAR transactivation in response to E2 (13Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Agoulnik, I., Stenoien, D., Mancini, M. A., and Weigel, N. (2000) in Keystone Steroid Symposium, Boulder, Colorado, March 28, Abstr. 302, Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute and The Directors Sponsor Fund.Google Scholar, 15Han G.

Hall S.H. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). E2 and DHT have similar structures except that E2 has a phenolic A-ring. It is therefore possible that although the wtAR may be able to bind to E2, E2 may not be well oriented within the wtAR-LBD pocket leading to weaker binding. Therefore, E2 may easily dissociate resulting in marginal activation of the wtAR. The recruitment of ARA70 or other selective coregulators to the wtAR, however, may change the conformation of the wtAR so that E2 can be trapped within the wtAR-LBD pocket allowing E2 to more effectively activate wtAR transactivation. In terms of mutants, the conformation of E2-bound AR mutant may not be similar to that of E2-bound wtAR. That difference in the conformation may influence on the receptor-interface providing for the coregulator recruitment.Our data in Figs. 5 and 6 show that ARA70 helps E2 competitively bind to the wtAR and subsequently retards E2 dissociation from the wtAR binding pocket. This phenomenon may be important during the prenatal period (7Tanagho E.A. McAninch J.W. Smith's General Urology. 15th Ed. Lange Medical Books McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 813Google Scholar) where high maternal estrogen levels may initiate estrogen signaling via the wtAR in the presence of coregulators, such as ARA70. For example, one report found that plasma concentrations of testosterone and E2 in mothers delivering male babies were 1.2 ± 0.4 and 4.5 ± 0.7 ng/ml, respectively (31Adeyemo O. Jeyakumar H. Afr. J. Med. Med. Sci. 1993; 22: 55-60PubMed Google Scholar), and these sex hormone levels may influence the balance between androgens and estrogens in the male fetus. Studies of 20 fetal rat testis samples collected during genital tract differentiation (gestation) also reported that there is a negligible level of circulating DHT in fetal rat plasma (32Habert R. Picon R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 2: 193-198Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, male and female rat fetuses had similar plasma levels of DHT and E2, although male fetuses did have higher levels of testosterone (32Habert R. Picon R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 2: 193-198Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). High aromatase activity during the last days of fetal life may also convert testosterone to E2 in male fetuses (32Habert R. Picon R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 2: 193-198Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 33George F.W. Ojeda S.R. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), further altering the balance of these sex hormones. Therefore, although male sexual differentiation and reproductive organ development are critically dependent on androgen-AR signaling, it is possible that estrogen-AR-coregulator signaling may influence androgen action in conditions where DHT levels are negligible and testosterone is readily aromatized to estrogen. The loss of the E2-AR-coregulator pathway may partly disrupt the balance between AR and ER signaling during critical stages in male reproductive system development. Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates that the S703G and E709K PAIS mutants cannot functionally interact with ARA70 in response to E2. Therefore, decreased total receptor activity in AR(S703G) and AR(E709K) PAIS patients may tip the balance in favor of ER signaling, resulting in undermasculinization.Our in vivo data in Fig. 8 show that ARA70 and the AR are both present in the interstitial cells of the mouse E16 testis. Primitive sex cords mature to form testis cords and the rete testis at 13 days postcoitum (34Rugh R. The Mouse: Its Reproduction and Development. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN1968: 282-289Google Scholar). By 15 days, the vas deferens, epididymis, and seminal vesicles arise from the Wolffian duct, and the testis develops prominent sex cords, each of which become a seminiferous tubule (34Rugh R. The Mouse: Its Reproduction and Development. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN1968: 282-289Google Scholar). At this point, the cord contains uniform but undifferentiated cells, which are precursors of spermatogenic or Sertoli cells. As the testis continues to develop, mesenchymal cells between the testis cords become Leydig cells. Leydig cells are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of testosterone, the primary hormone of the testis and a critical regulator of spermatogenesis. Leydig cells also produce 5α-reduced androgens, such as DHT and 3α-diol. E2 can be synthesized through the aromatization of testosterone by aromatase in the Sertoli cells and diffuse back to the Leydig cells (33George F.W. Ojeda S.R. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Rugh R. The Mouse: Its Reproduction and Development. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN1968: 282-289Google Scholar). Conversion of testosterone to estrogen also occurs in the Leydig cells. Testicular testosterone and its derivatives then induce masculine extragonadal differentiation. The abundance of ARA70 in testicular interstitial cells, at the time of E2 synthesis, supports our in vitro data showing the modulation of ARA70 on the AR-E2 binding. Moreover, this could imply that ARA70 impacts the development of male structures via not only the androgen-AR-ARA70 pathway but also the E2-AR-ARA70 pathway, to stimulate the development of genital organs, such as the vas deferens, epididymis, and seminal vesicle and the masculinization of the external genitalia.Our data therefore provide one possible molecular basis for a subset of PAIS phenotypes where mutation does not abolish androgen-AR signaling. Recent studies reported that ARA70 is not mutated in an analysis of 27 androgen insensitivity syndrome patients (35Lim H.N. Hawkins J.R. Hughes I.A. Clin. Genet. 2001; 59: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This finding excludes the possibility of ARA70 mutation in PAIS and supports our assertion that the loss of AR mutant functional interaction with ARA70, due to helix 3 mutations, may affect a subset of PAIS patients where androgen response is normal.In summary, our data provide one of the potential molecular causes to explain the development of PAIS in a subset of patients with AR mutants that respond normally to androgen. Moreover, our results have partially elucidated how ARA70 enhances the activation of the wtAR in response to E2. These findings suggest that certain coregulators may have an important role in the regulation of male reproductive system development specifically in modulation of E2 induction of the AR transactivation. Androgen action via the androgen receptor (AR)1 is critical in regulating male reproductive system development (1Quigley C.A., De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insufficient androgen action may cause androgen insensitivity syndrome or male undermasculinized genitalia (2Nitsche E.M. Hiort O. Horm. Res. 2000; 54: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The androgen insensitivity phenotypes vary from external genitalia that are completely female to degrees of partial masculinization. The possible causes may range from mutations in the AR or 5α-reductase genes to abnormal levels of estrogenversus androgen. Although partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS)-associated AR mutations usually disrupt the response to androgen, a subset of patients have AR mutations without any apparent defect in androgen signaling (3Radmayr C. Culig Z. Glatzl J. Neuschmid-Kaspar F. Bartsch G. Klocker H. J. Urol. 1997; 158: 1553-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Estrogen, primarily 17β-estradiol (E2), has also been proposed to be involved in both normal and abnormal processes of male reproductive development and associated diseases (5Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Cooke P.S. Mee S. Bigsby R.M. Higgins S.J. Sugimura Y. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 338-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 6Jarred R.A. Cancilla B. Prins G.S. Thayer K.A. Cunha G.R. Risbridger G.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Male estrogen is synthesized by aromatization of androgen, (e.g.testosterone), in many tissues including brain, liver, adipose tissue, and prostate (5Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Cooke P.S. Mee S. Bigsby R.M. Higgins S.J. Sugimura Y. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 338-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The physiological level of circulating E2 in the adult male is ∼0.1 nm (73–184 pmol/liter or 12–34 pg/ml), and in the adult female during pregnancy, the level of E2 is ∼1 nm (367–1285 pmol/liter or 100–350 pg/ml) (7Tanagho E.A. McAninch J.W. Smith's General Urology. 15th Ed. Lange Medical Books McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 813Google Scholar). However, local aromatase activity may cause particular tissue levels of E2 to be higher than the serum level. During pregnancy, maternal exposure to exogenous estrogen may influence the sexual maturation of male offspring, leading to cryptorchidism, epididymal cysts, and retained Mullerian ducts (8Rajfer J. Coffey D.S. Invest. Urol. 1978; 16: 186-190PubMed Google Scholar). Although estrogen action on the male reproductive system is not well understood, there is evidence of an estrogen-imprinting effect that may induce prostatic hyperplasia in male offspring with excess prenatal exposure to estrogen (9Prins G.S.

Hall S.H. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Gao T. Brantley K. Bolu E. McPhaul M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The differing results in CV-1 cells may reflect differences in cell passage number, growth conditions, or expression vectors. Therefore, certain coregulators may enable estrogen to influence AR target gene expression via the AR and thereby potentially contribute to male sexual maturation. Furthermore, there is evidence that the disruption of coactivators may also contribute to hormone resistance during target organ development (19Xu J. Qiu Y. DeMayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J.

Thus, certain PAIS-associated AR mutations may disrupt this estrogen-dependent AR transactivation, which is modulated by coregulators, during male reproductive system development. Here we have analyzed the functional interaction of PAIS-derived AR mutants with ARA70 in response to androgen or E2. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays, we demonstrate that E2 promotes the interaction of ARA70 with the wtAR but not with the PAIS mutants. By various ligand binding analyses, we also demonstrate that ARA70 increases the E2 competitive binding to the wtAR at the low levels of androgen and retards the dissociation of E2 from the wtAR-LBD but not from the PAIS mutants. ARA70 is present in various fetal mouse testicular cells during early embryogenesis day 16 and postpartum day 0 and is also significantly present in the Leydig cells at postpartum day 49. ARA70 may therefore be unable to stabilize the binding of E2 to the PAIS AR mutants, diminishing the effect of E2 via the AR during male reproductive system development in these patients.

Reifenstein syndrome is a less severe variant of X-linked PAIS in which affected individuals present as phenotypic males with hypospadias, inadequate pubertal virilization, gynecomastia, and infertility (30Aima J. Griffin J.E. Gazak J.M. Wilson J.D. MacDonald P.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 300: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 show that both of these PAIS mutants respond to androgen normally, but have lost the ARA70-dependent response to E2. Although E2 is a nonspecific ligand for the wtAR, certain coregulators, such as ARA70 or SRC-1, can enhance wtAR transactivation in response to E2 (13Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 14Agoulnik, I., Stenoien, D., Mancini, M. A., and Weigel, N.

It is therefore possible that although the wtAR may be able to bind to E2, E2 may not be well oriented within the wtAR-LBD pocket leading to weaker binding. Therefore, E2 may easily dissociate resulting in marginal activation of the wtAR. The recruitment of ARA70 or other selective coregulators to the wtAR, however, may change the conformation of the wtAR so that E2 can be trapped within the wtAR-LBD pocket allowing E2 to more effectively activate wtAR transactivation. In terms of mutants, the conformation of E2-bound AR mutant may not be similar to that of E2-bound wtAR. That difference in the conformation may influence on the receptor-interface providing for the coregulator recruitment.Our data in Figs. 5 and 6 show that ARA70 helps E2 competitively bind to the wtAR and subsequently retards E2 dissociation from the wtAR binding pocket. This phenomenon may be important during the prenatal period (7Tanagho E.A. McAninch J.W. Smith's General Urology. 15th Ed. Lange Medical Books McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 813Google Scholar) where high maternal estrogen levels may initiate estrogen signaling via the wtAR in the presence of coregulators, such as ARA70. For example, one report found that plasma concentrations of testosterone and E2 in mothers delivering male babies were 1.2 ± 0.4 and 4.5 ± 0.7 ng/ml, respectively (31Adeyemo O. Jeyakumar H. Afr. J. Med. Med. Sci. 1993; 22: 55-60PubMed Google Scholar), and these sex hormone levels may influence the balance between androgens and estrogens in the male fetus. Studies of 20 fetal rat testis samples collected during genital tract differentiation (gestation) also reported that there is a negligible level of circulating DHT in fetal rat plasma (32Habert R. Picon R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 2: 193-198Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, male and female rat fetuses had similar plasma levels of DHT and E2, although male fetuses did have higher levels of testosterone (32Habert R. Picon R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 2: 193-198Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). High aromatase activity during the last days of fetal life may also convert testosterone to E2 in male fetuses (32Habert R. Picon R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 2: 193-198Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 33George F.W. Ojeda S.R. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), further altering the balance of these sex hormones. Therefore, although male sexual differentiation and reproductive organ development are critically dependent on androgen-AR signaling, it is possible that estrogen-AR-coregulator signaling may influence androgen action in conditions where DHT levels are negligible and testosterone is readily aromatized to estrogen. The loss of the E2-AR-coregulator pathway may partly disrupt the balance between AR and ER signaling during critical stages in male reproductive system development. Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates that the S703G and E709K PAIS mutants cannot functionally interact with ARA70 in response to E2. Therefore, decreased total receptor activity in AR(S703G) and AR(E709K) PAIS patients may tip the balance in favor of ER signaling, resulting in undermasculinization.Our in vivo data in Fig. 8 show that ARA70 and the AR are both present in the interstitial cells of the mouse E16 testis. Primitive sex cords mature to form testis cords and the rete testis at 13 days postcoitum (34Rugh R. The Mouse: Its Reproduction and Development. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN1968: 282-289Google Scholar). By 15 days, the vas deferens, epididymis, and seminal vesicles arise from the Wolffian duct, and the testis develops prominent sex cords, each of which become a seminiferous tubule (34Rugh R. The Mouse: Its Reproduction and Development. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN1968: 282-289Google Scholar). At this point, the cord contains uniform but undifferentiated cells, which are precursors of spermatogenic or Sertoli cells. As the testis continues to develop, mesenchymal cells between the testis cords become Leydig cells. Leydig cells are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of testosterone, the primary hormone of the testis and a critical regulator of spermatogenesis. Leydig cells also produce 5α-reduced androgens, such as DHT and 3α-diol. E2 can be synthesized through the aromatization of testosterone by aromatase in the Sertoli cells and diffuse back to the Leydig cells (33George F.W. Ojeda S.R. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Rugh R. The Mouse: Its Reproduction and Development. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN1968: 282-289Google Scholar). Conversion of testosterone to estrogen also occurs in the Leydig cells. Testicular testosterone and its derivatives then induce masculine extragonadal differentiation. The abundance of ARA70 in testicular interstitial cells, at the time of E2 synthesis, supports our in vitro data showing the modulation of ARA70 on the AR-E2 binding. Moreover, this could imply that ARA70 impacts the development of male structures via not only the androgen-AR-ARA70 pathway but also the E2-AR-ARA70 pathway, to stimulate the development of genital organs, such as the vas deferens, epididymis, and seminal vesicle and the masculinization of the external genitalia.Our data therefore provide one possible molecular basis for a subset of PAIS phenotypes where mutation does not abolish androgen-AR signaling. Recent studies reported that ARA70 is not mutated in an analysis of 27 androgen insensitivity syndrome patients (35Lim H.N. Hawkins J.R. Hughes I.A. Clin. Genet. 2001; 59: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This finding excludes the possibility of ARA70 mutation in PAIS and supports our assertion that the loss of AR mutant functional interaction with ARA70, due to helix 3 mutations, may affect a subset of PAIS patients where androgen response is normal.In summary, our data provide one of the potential molecular causes to explain the development of PAIS in a subset of patients with AR mutants that respond normally to androgen. Moreover, our results have partially elucidated how ARA70 enhances the activation of the wtAR in response to E2. These findings suggest that certain coregulators may have an important role in the regulation of male reproductive system development specifically in modulation of E2 induction of the AR transactivation. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is characterized by a spectrum of deficient male virilization or undermasculinization including testicular feminization (29Felig P. Frohman L.A. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 779-824Google Scholar). It is known that if androgen action is slightly less than optimal, there will be undervirilization or inefficient spermatogenesis (29Felig P. Frohman L.A. Endocrinology and Metabolism. 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 779-824Google Scholar). Although mutation of the AR is often found in PAIS patients, certain mutations associated with PAIS respond normally to androgen (4Gottlieb B. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The first mutation analyzed in this study, AR(S703G), was identified in a patient diagnosed with male pseudohermaphroditism, which is associated with PAIS (3Radmayr C. Culig Z. Glatzl J.

A deficiency of GAA is responsible for a recessively inherited myopathy and cardiomyopathy, glycogenosis type II.

In this study, over-expression and depletion of Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD) strategies were used to investigate whether expression of the GAA gene is under the control of Notch-1/Hes-1 signaling. In co-transfection experiments, Hes-1, up-regulated by over-expressed NICD, enhanced the repressive effect of the DNA element with wild type Hes-1 binding sites but not with mutant Hes-1 binding sites. Conversely, depletion of Notch-1 with phosphorothioated antisense oligonucleotides, corresponding to the fourth ankyrin repeat within NICD, led to reduced Hes-1.

Acid α-glucosidase (GAA; acid maltase, EC 3.2.1.20) is a glycogen-degrading lysosomal enzyme, a deficiency of which causes glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII, also called Pompe's disease or acid maltase deficiency), a recessively inherited muscle disease (26Hirschhorn R.

GAA belongs to a large family of lysosomal enzymes. The regulation of this gene, as well as that of other lysosomal enzyme genes, is largely unknown. In previous studies (27Yan B. Heus J., Lu, N.

Hes-1, binding to a C class E box (CACGCG) within an intronic repressor element, down-regulates the human GAA gene expression. To determine whether the human GAA gene is under the control of the Notch-1/Hes-1 signaling pathway, we have investigated the effect of Notch-1 and Hes-1 on expression of the humanGAA gene in HepG2 cells. We have demonstrated the Notch-1/Hes-1 pathway in HepG2 cells and shown that the humanGAA gene is a downstream target of Notch-1/Hes-1 signaling. Expression plasmid constructs containing four copies of repressor element with wild type (4xwtHes-1/TK-CAT) or mutant Hes-1 binding E box (4xmutHes-1/TK-CAT) used for co-transfection experiments were described previously (27Yan B.

The expression construct for Hes-1, pcDNA3-wtHes-1, was a gift from Drs. Michael Caudy and Felix Loh (Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY). The expression construct for NICD, cytohN1pcDNA3, was a gift from Prof. Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA). All of the plasmids were prepared and purified for transfection with a Qiagen Maxim Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For co-transfection experiments, 4xwtHes-1/TK-CAT or 4xmutHes-1/TK-CAT (1.0 μg) were incubated with plasmid pcDNA3 or cytohN1-pcDNA3 (3.0 μg), together with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE. Expression plasmid pXGH5 for human growth hormone (0.5 μg) was included as an internal control of the transfection efficiency. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested for CAT and hGH activity assays (CAT and hGH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CAT activities were further standardized to hGH activities. For stable transfection, pcDNA3, cytohN1pcDNA3, or pcDNA3-Hes-1 was transfected into HepG2 cells with LipofectAMINE. Individual colonies were obtained with G418 (0.6 mg/ml) selection for 2 weeks. The colonies were grown and expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with G418 (0.6 mg/ml) for further assays. Pools of pcDNA3-transfected HepG2 cells were obtained by G418 selection for 2 weeks and used as controls. Phosphorothioated antisense oligonucleotides of 30mer in length corresponding to fourth ankyrin repeat within NICD were used for depletion of Notch1 in HepG2 cells. The DNA sequence is 5′-GCCCGCATGCATGATGGCACGACGCCACTG-3′ (28Ellisen L.W. Bird J. West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). No homology of the sequence was found with a BLAST search of the GenBankTM data base. The corresponding phosphorothioated sense oligonucleotides were used as internal control. All of the oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Lofstrand Labs Limited (Gaithersburg, MD). Oligonucleotides (2.0 μm) were incubated with LipofectAMINE (5 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) and overlaid onto the cells as described (20Zheng J.L. Shou J. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Gao W.Q. Development. 2000; 127: 4551-4560PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zine A. Van De Water T.R. de Ribaupierre F. Development. 2000; 127: 3373-3383PubMed Google Scholar). The medium containing oligonucleotides-LipofectAMINE complexes was changed daily for 1 week. HepG2 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 or cytohN1pcDNA3 and LipofectAMINE. Total RNA was extracted at intervals after transfection with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures. A Hes-1 probe (697 bp) was generated by PCR with pcDNA3-wtHes-1 as a template with the primers 5′-CCAGTGTCAACACGACACCGGATAAACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTGCTGGTGTAGACGGGGATGACAG-3′ (reverse). Cell lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1.0% sodium deoxycholate, aprotinin 2.0 μg/ml, leupeptin 2.0 μg/ml, pepstatin 1.0 μg/ml, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone 50 μg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 100 μg/ml). Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (30Hoemann C.D. Beaulieu N. Girard L. Rebai N. Jolicoeur P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3831-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Raben N., Lu, N. Nagaraju K. Rivera Y. Lee A. Yan B. Byrne B. Meikle P.J. Umapathysivam K. Hopwood J.J. Plotz P.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2039-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NICD, Hes-1, and GAA were detected using anti-Notch1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-Hes-1 antibody (a gift of Dr. Tetsuo Sudo, Toray Industries, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan), and anti-hGAA antibody (a gift of Dr. Barry J. Byrne, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) respectively. Immunodetection of β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for loading control. HepG2 cells were prepared with lysis buffer (0.9% NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100). The GAA and β-hexosaminidase activities of transfected HepG2 cells were assayed by conversion of the substrates 4-methylumbelliferyld-glucoside and 4-methylumbelliferylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide to the fluorescent product umbelliferone as described (32Hermans M.M. Kroos M.A. van Beeumen J. Oostra B.A. Reuser A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13507-13512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration of whole cell lysate was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Hes-1has been shown to be a downstream target of Notch-1 signaling in human cell lines (22Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To determine whether Notch-1/Hes-1 signaling is functional in HepG2 cells, co-transfection experiments were carried out with reporter gene constructs containing Hes-1 binding sites and NICD expression plasmid. Expression of the reporter gene linked to the wild type Hes-1 sites was significantly down-regulated by NICD (Fig.1B). In contrast, expression of the reporter gene linked to mutant Hes-1 sites was not affected (Fig. 1B), suggesting that intact Hes-1 sites are required for NICD effect. To establish the relationship between Notch-1 and Hes-1 in HepG2 cells, NICD was transiently transfected into the cells, and Northern blot analysis was performed with Hes-1 cDNA as a probe at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post-transfection. A 2.3-fold up-regulation of theHes-1 gene expression by NICD, compared with empty vector, was observed at 2 h post-transfection (Fig. 1C). This up-regulation, however, was transient and became marginal at later time points (not shown). The validity of the Notch-1/Hes-1 pathway in HepG2 cells was further confirmed by depletion of Notch-1 with phosphorothioated antisense oligonucleotides of 30mer corresponding to the fourth ankyrin repeat of NICD. Corresponding phosphorothioated sense oligonucleotide was used as a control. After treatment for 1 week the depletion of Notch-1 (62%) was accompanied by a decrease in Hes-1 gene expression, as shown by the 56% reduction of Hes-1 protein on Western analysis (Fig.2) To demonstrate the effect of Hes-1 on the endogenous GAA gene, HepG2 cells were transfected with Hes-1 expression plasmid and stably transfected colonies were analyzed. Over-expression of Hes-1 down-regulated GAA gene expression, resulting in a decrease in the GAA protein level as shown by Western analysis (Fig.3, A and B). Consistent with these results, up to 30% reduction in GAA enzyme activity was observed after Hes-1 over-expression (Fig. 3C). Another lysosomal enzyme, β-hexosaminidase, used as an internal control, was not affected by over-expressed Hes-1 (Fig. 3C). Thus, expression of the GAA gene is negatively regulated by Hes-1 in HepG2 cells. The effect of NICD over-expression in HepG2 cells was similar to that of Hes-1-negative regulation of the GAA gene expression. HepG2 cells constitutively expressing ectopic NICD were obtained by transfection with cytohN1pcDNA3 and selection with G418. As shown in Fig. 4, over-expression of NICD confirmed by Western blot with anti-Notch1 antibody (Fig.4A), resulted in a reduced amount of GAA protein (Fig.4B) and reduced enzyme activity (Fig. 4C). The data strongly suggest that human GAA is regulated by Notch-1/Hes-1 pathway in HepG2 cells. GAA is a typical housekeeping gene that is expressed in every tissue. It has been shown, however, that during development there are significant quantitative differences in the level of murine GAA expression in different tissues and even within a particular tissue (33Ponce E. Witte D.P. Hirschhorn R. Huie M.L. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1089-9106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that the gene may be regulated at the transcriptional level. In humans, both protein and enzyme activity are significantly higher in newborns compared with adults, again suggesting that the gene is transcriptionally regulated during development (34Umapathysivam K. Hopwood J.J. Meikle P.J. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 1378-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In our previous studies (27Yan B. Heus J., Lu, N. Nichols R.C. Raben N. Plotz P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1789-1793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Yan B. Raben N., Lu, N. Plotz P.H. Hum. Genet. 2001; 109: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) we identified a cis-acting negative regulatory element in the first intron of the GAA gene and demonstrated that transcription factor Hes-1 binds to the element in a tissue-specific manner and functions as a repressor in HepG2 cells. TheHes-1 gene and its homologues are immediate downstream genes of the Notch signaling pathway in many cells. In this study, we provide evidence of the Notch-1/Hes-1 pathway in HepG2 cells, demonstrating that the human GAA gene is a downstream target of Notch-1/Hes-1 signaling. This pathway may contribute to the developmental control of GAA gene expression. Several lines of evidence indicate that Hes-1 is under Notch-1 control in HepG2 cells; depletion of Notch-1 led to a decreased level of Hes-1, whereas over-expression of NICD led to up-regulation of endogenous Hes-1, which in turn down-regulated the reporter gene expression through binding to its recognition sequence. The up-regulation of endogenous Hes-1 transcription by over-expressed NICD in HepG2 cells, detectable at 2 h post-transfection, was transient, however; the effect became marginal afterward. Although several studies have demonstrated thatHes-1 is activated by constitutively over-expressed NICD (18Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Deftos M.L. Huang E. Ojala E.W. Forbush K.A. Bevan M.J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3200-3205PubMed Google Scholar), others have reported only marginal or no changes inHes-1 gene expression under Notch-1 signaling (38Shawber C. Nofziger D. Hsieh J.J. Lindsell C. Bogler O. Hayward D. Weinmaster G. Development. 1996; 122: 3765-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Transient activation of Hes-1 gene expression has also been observed under ligand-activated Notch-1 signaling and retinoic acid-induced differentiation (40Kuroda K. Tani S. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Kurooka H. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7238-7244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 41Grynfeld A. Pahlman S. Axelson H. Int. J.

(Tokyo). 2000; 128: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This transient activation ofHes-1 is most likely due to the ability of the protein to negatively auto-regulate itself because three stretches of recognition sequence (N boxes) are present within the promoter of Hes-1gene (11Feder J.N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 43Feder J.N., Li, L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This autoregulation loop of Hes-1 gene expression may act as a regulator for the varied functions of Notch-1 signaling during development (45Nakagawa O. McFadden D.G. Nakagawa M. Yanagisawa H., Hu, T. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13655-13660Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The link between GAA and Notch-1/Hes-1 pathway was established by demonstrating a repressive effect of both Notch-1 and Hes-1 on the levels of GAA protein and activity. The effect was not a dramatic one, which is hardly surprising. After all, only minor differences in the level of GAA activity separate the most severe rapidly progressive form of GSDII (Pompe's disease) from milder late-onset variants of the disease. Recently, another Hes-related repressor protein, HERP, has been shown to be a target of Notch-1 signaling, which functions as a heterodimer partner of Hes-1 (39Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 45Nakagawa O. McFadden D.G. Nakagawa M. Yanagisawa H., Hu, T. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13655-13660Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 46Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S., Wu, H.Y. Chung G. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although our data do not rule out the role of HERP, we believe that Hes-1 rather than HERP is mainly responsible for the transcriptional repression of the humanGAA gene because the silencer in the GAA gene contains a recognition sequence a C class E box (CACGCG) preferred by Hes-1 (46Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S., Wu, H.Y. Chung G. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These new data thus show yet another aspect of the Notch-1/Hes-1 signaling pathway; demonstrate that regulation of a so-called housekeeping gene, GAA, may be quite complex; and suggest that this lysosomal enzyme may have still unrecognized physiological roles in development."
