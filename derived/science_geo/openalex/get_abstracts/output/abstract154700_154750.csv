Here, using positron emission tomography (PET) and regional cerebral blood flow measurements, we show that waking experience influences regional brain activity during subsequent sleep. Several brain areas activated during the execution of a serial reaction time task during wakefulness were significantly more active during REM sleep in subjects previously trained on the task than in non-trained subjects. These results support the hypothesis that memory traces are processed during REM sleep in humans."

We found that the flavonoid potently inhibited transcription by RNA polymerase II in vitro by blocking the transition into productive elongation, a step controlled by P-TEFb. The ability of P-TEFb to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II was inhibited by flavopiridol with aK i of 3 nm. Interestingly, the drug was not competitive with ATP. P-TEFb composed of Cdk9 and cyclin T1 is a required cellular cofactor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transactivator, Tat. Consistent with its ability to inhibit P-TEFb, flavopiridol blocked Tat transactivation of the viral promoter in vitro.

Biochemical evidence indicated that flavopiridol most strongly inhibited Cdk1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 and was less potent on other Cdks tested including Cdk7 (1Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). A structure of Cdk2 complexed with flavopiridol revealed that the drug docks in the ATP binding site (4De A.W.J. Mueller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulze-Gahmen U. Worland P.J. Sausville E. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two previous studies demonstrated an effect of flavopiridol on transcription. Mammalian cells treated with the compound showed decreased transcription of the gene encoding cyclin D1 (5Carlson B. Lahusen T. Singh S. Loaiza-Perez A. Worland P.J. Pestell R. Albanese C. Sausville E.A. Senderowicz A.M.

The transcriptional inhibition observed in these studies could have been direct or a consequence of altered progression through the cell cycle. The present study focuses on P-TEFb, a protein kinase composed of Cdk9 and a cyclin subunit derived from one of three different genes (7Fu T.J. Peng J. Price D.H. Flores O. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and is a cellular cofactor required for activation of transcription of the HIV-1 genome by the viral transactivator Tat (10Zhu Y.

Tat forms a triple complex with P-TEFb containing Cdk9 and cyclin T1 and the nascent transcript from the HIV-1 promoter (TAR) (12Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4592-4599Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This recruitment of P-TEFb activates transcription by causing an increase in the number of RNA polymerase II molecules that synthesize full-length mRNAs (10Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4189-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that flavopiridol inhibited P-TEFb causing inhibition of transcription, especially from the HIV-1 promoter in the presence of Tat. The properties of the inhibitor toward P-TEFb and on Tat transactivation suggest that the drug should be examined as a potential HIV-1 therapy. Pulse-chase transcription assays were carried out as described previously (16Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 17Peng J. Liu M. Marion J. Zhu Y. Price D.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) except for modifications indicated in the text. Kinase assays were as described in Marshall et al. (18Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) using Drosophila RNA polymerase II as the substrate. A 10 mm stock of flavopiridol (Aventis Inc.) in Me2SO was stored at −80 °C. The stock was diluted to 0.1 mm in Me2SO, and a set of serial dilutions in 4% Me2SO was used to give the indicated concentration of flavopiridol. The final concentration of Me2SO in transcription or kinase assays was less than 1%. 50 μl of high titer viral stock generated from transfecting 293T cells with the HIV-1HXB2 provirus was added to 104 Sx22-1 cells that contain one copy of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat linked to the β-galactosidase reporter gene (19Fackler O.T. Kienzle N. Kremmer E. Boese A. Schramm B. Klimkait T. Kucherer C. Mueller-Lantzsch N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 5 h to allow entry and integration of HIV-1, washed, and grown for an additional 36 h before being fixed and stained for β-galactosidase (19Fackler O.T. Kienzle N. Kremmer E. Boese A. Schramm B. Klimkait T. Kucherer C. Mueller-Lantzsch N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Flavopiridol was added to the culture 12 h prior to the infection, and cells were grown in its presence for the duration of the assay. In the presence of 10 μg of Polybrene, HIV-1NL4–3 viral particles (containing 2 ng of p24 gag) were added to 5 × 104Jurkat cells. After 5 h virus was removed by extensive washing. Flavopiridol was added at indicated concentrations from 1.5 to 25 nm. On days 2, 5, 8, 11, and 15, supernatants were collected and cells were incubated with fresh medium and flavopiridol. Reverse transcriptase activity was measured on 10 μl of the supernatant. With the high multiplicity of infection used most Jurkat cells were killed after 10 days of infection, and viral titers returned to base-line levels. To investigate the effects of flavopiridol on transcription anin vitro assay with a template containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and HeLa nuclear extract was used. The inclusion of increasing concentrations of flavopiridol in the reaction resulted in a dramatic inhibition of the appearance of the 660-nucleotide run-off transcript (Fig.1 A). The radioactivity in run-off transcripts was quantitated, and the IC50 for the inhibitory effect was determined to be 34 nm. To determine if flavopiridol inhibited initiation or elongation a pulse-chase assay was used to separate the two processes. Flavopiridol was added into the reactions during the formation of preinitiation complexes (preincubation), initiation (pulse), or elongation (chase) (Fig.1 B). Initiation was not inhibited by the drug as indicated by the uniform production of short transcripts during the pulse (Fig.1 B, lanes marked P). However, the addition of flavopiridol at any step resulted in decreased levels of run-off transcripts during the subsequent chase (Fig. 1 B,lanes marked C). Under the influence of flavopiridol the elongation complexes produced shorter, incomplete transcripts indicating that flavopiridol affected the elongation stage of transcription. Almost identical results were obtained when 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) was used instead of flavopiridol (Fig. 1 C). DRB inhibits P-TEFb, a cyclin-dependent kinase that controls the number of polymerases that enter into productive elongation (20Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This similarity suggests that flavopiridol might inhibit P-TEFb function, but an alternative explanation, that the drug might slow the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II, was also possible. To determine if flavopiridol directly inhibited RNA polymerase II, early elongation complexes were isolated under stringent washing conditions that eliminate all known factors able to affect the elongation properties of the polymerase (17Peng J. Liu M. Marion J. Zhu Y. Price D.H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The polymerases in these complexes are able to efficiently, albeit slowly, elongate their nascent transcripts as indicated by the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-min chase time points (Fig. 1 D). Flavopiridol had no effect on the elongation properties of RNA polymerase II because transcripts produced in a 5-min chase with increasing amounts of flavopiridol were all the same length (Fig. 1 D). Flavopiridol did not have any affect on transcription in vitro by RNA polymerase I or III (data not shown). The data in Fig. 1 strongly suggest that flavopiridol affects the action of P-TEFb. We next examined the effect of flavopiridol on the ability of P-TEFb to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. The kinase assay (18Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) utilized recombinant P-TEFb, composed of human Cdk9 and cyclin T1 (8Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and purified RNA polymerase II. P-TEFb was dramatically inhibited by flavopiridol in a standard assay using 10 μm ATP (Fig.2 A). The IC50 was calculated to be 6 nm. Assays were also carried out using 30, 100, and 300 μm ATP. We were surprised to find that the IC50 did not vary significantly (6–10 nm) at the different concentrations of ATP (Fig. 2,A–D). The data from Fig. 2 were fit to equations derived for competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition (21Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The data fit uncompetitive inhibition best and gave an apparentK i of 3 nm. This is 4 orders of magnitude below the K m for ATP of 36 μm. Even though the kinetic analysis suggested that the drug was not competitive with ATP, a competitive mechanism is possible if very tight binding of the inhibitor essentially inactivates the enzyme. Regardless of the mechanism, these results indicate that flavopiridol is the most effective P-TEFb inhibitor described so far. Because P-TEFb comprised of Cdk9 and cyclin T1 is required for activation of the HIV-1 promoter by Tat, we examined the effect of flavopiridol on the ability of Tat to activate transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in vitro. Tat stimulated the appearance of a 694-nucleotide run-off transcript from the HIV-1 promoter about 5-fold (Fig. 3 A). As has been found before, the P-TEFb inhibitor DRB blocked the formation of long run-off transcripts (Fig. 3 A). When increasing concentrations of flavopiridol were included in Tat transactivation reactions the amount of run-off transcription was reduced to background levels. Quantitation of the results indicated that the IC50 was 7 nm(Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the ability of flavopiridol to inhibit the kinase activity of P-TEFb. Flores et al. (22Flores O. Lee G. Kessler J. Miller M. Schlief W. Tomassini J. Hazuda D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7208-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) demonstrated that reducing the activity of P-TEFb via the expression of a dominant negative Cdk9 protein or treatment with P-TEFb inhibitors reduced HIV-1 replication in cells. Therefore, effects of flavopiridol on the single round of infection by HIV-1HXB2 in Sx22-1 indicator cells and viral replication of HIV-1NL4–3 in Jurkat cells were examined (Fig.4). Sx22-1 cells are HeLa cells that contain one copy of the HIV-1 promoter linked to the β-galactosidase reporter gene and can be efficiently infected by the HIV-1HXB2 strain. Following the infection by HIV-1, the production of Tat leads to the expression of β-galactosidase, which is detected by the blue staining of Sx22-1 cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (19Fackler O.T. Kienzle N. Kremmer E. Boese A. Schramm B. Klimkait T. Kucherer C. Mueller-Lantzsch N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The addition of flavopiridol reduced the number of blue cells to background levels and exhibited an IC50 of 8 nm(Fig. 4 A). Of note, the Sx22-1 cells remained viable even at the highest concentrations of flavopiridol (100 nm) as determined by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). These findings were extended with a viral spread assay using Jurkat cells infected with the HIV-1NL4–3 virus (Fig. 4 B). Using high multiplicities of infection, these cells produce maximal viral titers 5 days after the initial infection after which the cells begin to die. Reverse transcriptase assays again demonstrated that flavopiridol reduced the production of virus in a dose-dependent fashion. As was found in the single-round assay, a dramatic block of HIV-1 replication occurred at a concentration of flavopiridol between 6 and 12.5 nm (Fig. 4 B). Cells that did not replicate HIV-1 remained viable at the highest concentration of flavopiridol used (25 nm) (data not shown). We conclude that flavopiridol blocks HIV-1 replication at low nanomolar concentrations in human cells. The results presented here demonstrate that flavopiridol inhibits P-TEFb more potently than the previously suspected targets Cdk1 and Cdk4. Our data indicate that the K i for flavopiridol against P-TEFb (3 nm) is significantly lower than theK i against either Cdk1 (41 nm) (2Losiewicz M.D. Carlson B.A. Kaur G. Sausville E.A. Worland P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) or Cdk4 (65 nm) (3Carlson B.A. Dubay M.M. Sausville E.A. Brizuela L. Worland P.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2973-2978PubMed Google Scholar). Because flavopiridol is not competitive with ATP on P-TEFb but is competitive with ATP on Cdk1 and Cdk4, there should be an even greater difference in IC50 between P-TEFbs compared with Cdk1 or Cdk4 at the high ATP levels foundin vivo. Because flavopiridol inhibits P-TEFb much more potently than other Cdks, it is possible that the antiproliferative effects of the drug might be due to inhibition of P-TEFb and the subsequent negative effect on transcription. The lack of competition with ATP we found for P-TEFb inhibition by flavopiridol suggests that the drug binds relatively tightly to P-TEFb. Because a crystal structure indicates that the drug docks in the ATP binding site of Cdk2 (4De A.W.J. Mueller-Dieckmann H.J. Schulze-Gahmen U. Worland P.J. Sausville E. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2735-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), it is likely that the ATP binding site of P-TEFb is also targeted. It is also possible that flavopiridol binds to another site and this is supported by the kinetic data that fit an uncompetitive model best. A structure of P-TEFb complexed with flavopiridol would be useful in resolving this issue. The involvement of P-TEFb in the regulation of transcription from the HIV-1 promoter is well documented, but it is not clear why replication of the virus is more sensitive to reduction of P-TEFb activity than other viral or cellular promoters. One study used both an in vitro and in vivo assay to screen a library of over 100,000 compounds for molecules that blocked Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter but not expression from the CMV promoter. Every compound identified was found to inhibit P-TEFb (23Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D.H. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Three of these inhibitors were shown to block HIV-1, but not human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type 1 replication at concentrations that were on average about 14 times lower than concentrations that caused cytotoxic effects (22Flores O. Lee G. Kessler J. Miller M. Schlief W. Tomassini J. Hazuda D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7208-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Significantly, expression of a dominant negative Cdk9 transgene at levels equal to the wild-type Cdk9 dramatically reduced the ability of the cells to support HIV-1 replication (22Flores O. Lee G. Kessler J. Miller M. Schlief W. Tomassini J. Hazuda D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7208-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HIV-1 replication in T cells requires activation of the cells, which is coupled to up-regulation of cyclin T1 levels (24Garriga J. Peng J. Parreno M. Price D.H. Henderson E.E. Grana X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3093-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Initiation from the HIV-1 promoter in T cells before activation is not accompanied by efficient elongation to make viral mRNAs. After T cell activation, when the levels of P-TEFb containing cyclin T1 have increased, viral mRNAs are produced. This tight control of expression in vivosuggests that the HIV-1 promoter is strongly controlled by the action of negative factors that increase the dependence on P-TEFb. Two factors, negative elongation factor and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor, play a general role in elongation control (25Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 27Garber M.E. Jones K.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor has been shown to play a role in Tat transactivation (28Wu-Baer F. Lane W.S. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is also possible that a CTD phosphatase might be especially active at the HIV-1 promoter. Presumably, the phosphatase would have a negative effect on elongation by reversing the P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of the CTD. Support for this idea comes from the finding that the phosphatase is inhibited by Tat (29Marshall N.F. Dahmus G.K. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31726-31730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Cho H. Kim T.K. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism of enhanced sensitivity of transcription from the HIV-1 promoter compared with other viral and cellular promoters are needed. These future studies should emphasize in vivo assays with virus or stably integrated viral promoters (22Flores O. Lee G. Kessler J. Miller M. Schlief W. Tomassini J. Hazuda D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7208-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), because less than a 5-fold difference was seen between the HIV-1 and CMV promoter in vitro (Figs.1 and 3) and in transient transfection assays (not shown). Because P-TEFb is a key factor in HIV-1 infection and flavopiridol blocks HIV-1 propagation in cultured cells, we suggest that flavopiridol should be evaluated as a potential AIDS therapy. Currently the drug must be administered parenterally, and at its maximal tolerated dose in cancer patients (200–400 nm), it caused diarrhea and a proinflammatory syndrome (31Senderowicz A.M. Headlee D. Stinson S.F. Lush R.M. Kalil N. Villalba L. Hill K. Steinberg S.M. Figg W.D. Tompkins A. Arbuck S.G. Sausville E.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 2986-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, selection of lower dose levels that achieve the nanomolar drug levels predicted from these experiments to be potentially useful (10–20 nm) might alleviate these problems. The concept of using a P-TEFb inhibitor, however, may be broadly applicable because P-TEFb is also required for HIV-2, equine infectious anemia virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, and bovine immunodeficiency virus (11Taube R. Fujinaga K. Wimmer J. Barboric M. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 1999; 264: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment with current drugs results in the selection and propagation of resistant viral strains. Because P-TEFb is a cellular factor it is unlikely that resistant strains will arise. We thank Bryce Plapp (University of Iowa) for help with the kinetic analysis of flavopiridol inhibition of P-TEFb."

We made recombinant betaig-h3 proteins, which were highly active in mediating human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell adhesion and spreading. The 2nd and the 4th repeated domains were sufficient to mediate HCE cell adhesion. A sequence analysis showed that aspartic acid (Asp) and isoleucine (Ile) of the 2nd and the 4th domains are highly conserved in many fasciclin 1 homologous (fas-1) domains. Substitution mutational study identified these two amino acids are essential for cell adhesion. Synthetic peptides containing Asp and Ile, NKDIL and EPDIM derived from the 2nd and the 4th domains, respectively, almost completely blocked cell adhesion mediated by not only wild type betaig-h3 but also each of the 2nd and the 4th domains. These peptides alone were fully active in mediating cell adhesion. In addition, we demonstrated the functional receptor for betaig-h3 is alpha(3)beta(1) integrin. These results, therefore, establish the essential motifs within the 2nd and the 4th domains of betaig-h3, which interact with alpha(3)beta(1) integrin to mediate HCE cell adhesion to betaig-h3 and suggest that other proteins containing Asp-Ile in their fas-1 domains could possibly function as cell adhesion molecules."

Only theΔndhD1/ΔndhD2(ΔndhD1/D2) mutant was unable to grow under photoheterotrophic conditions and exhibited low respiration rate, although the mutant grew normally under photoautotrophic conditions in air. The ΔndhD3/ΔndhD4(ΔndhD3/D4) mutant grew very slowly in air and did not take up CO2. The results demonstrated the presence of two types of functionally distinct NAD(P)H dehydrogenases in Synechocystis PCC6803 cells. TheΔndhD5/ΔndhD6(ΔndhD5/D6) mutant grew like the wild-type strain. Under far-red light (>710 nm), the level of P700+was high in ΔndhD1/D2 and M55 (ndhB-less mutant) at low intensities.

Only theΔndhD1/ΔndhD2(ΔndhD1/D2) mutant was unable to grow under photoheterotrophic conditions and exhibited low respiration rate, although the mutant grew normally under photoautotrophic conditions in air. The ΔndhD3/ΔndhD4(ΔndhD3/D4) mutant grew very slowly in air and did not take up CO2. The results demonstrated the presence of two types of functionally distinct NAD(P)H dehydrogenases in Synechocystis PCC6803 cells. TheΔndhD5/ΔndhD6(ΔndhD5/D6) mutant grew like the wild-type strain. Under far-red light (>710 nm), the level of P700+was high in ΔndhD1/D2 and M55 (ndhB-less mutant) at low intensities. The capacity ofQ A (tightly bound plastoquinone) reduction by plastoquinone pool, as measured by the fluorescence increase in darkness upon addition of KCN, was much less inΔndhD1/D2 and M55 than inΔndhD3/D4 andΔndhD5/D6. We conclude that electrons from NADPH are transferred to the plastoquinone pool mainly by the NdhD1·NdhD2 type of NAD(P)H dehydrogenases. Type I NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex inorganic carbon 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea far red plastoquinone succinate:quinol oxidoreductase N-Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid photosystem I tightly bound plastoquinone The Type I NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (NDH-1)1 in cyanobacteria is involved in both the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains (1Schmetterer G. Bryant D. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 409-435Crossref Google Scholar). The whole genome sequence data base forSynechocystis sp. PCC6803 has shown the presence of genes for 12 subunits of NDH-1 with the large, hydrophobic NdhB, NdhD, and NdhF subunits being core membrane components (2Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). The data base also reveals that ndhD and ndhF are present as gene families with six and three members, respectively (note that NdhF4 has homology to NdhD5 and has been designated as NdhD6 (3Price G.D. Sültemeyer D. Klughammer B.D. Ludwig M. Badger M.R. Can. J. Bot. 1998; 76: 973-1002Google Scholar)), although most ndh genes are present as single copies. This suggests that several types of NDH-1 exist in cyanobacteria, each with different NdhD and/or NdhF subunits, and with each potential complex having differing functions (4Klughammer B.D. Sültemeyer D. Badger M.R. Price G.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1316-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Ohkawa H. Sonoda M. Katoh H. Ogawa T. Can. J.

In fact, of the five ndhD-less mutants, ΔndhD3 is the only mutant that displays the phenotype of slow growth at limiting CO2(i.e. 50 ppm CO2) and reduced affinity for CO2 uptake, whereas the other ndhD-less mutants (ΔndhD1, ΔndhD2,ΔndhD4, and ΔndhD5) do not show such phenotype (6Ohkawa H. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated that NDH-1 is essential for inorganic carbon (CO2 and HCO3−; designated Ci) transport in cyanobacteria (3Price G.D.

Biol. 1999; 50: 539-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), and it was assumed that ATP produced by NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron flow is essential to energize the Ci transport (7Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,12Mi H. Endo T. Schreiber U. Ogawa T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 163-173Google Scholar). However, a recent observation indicated that mutations inndh genes lead to inhibition of CO2 uptake rather than HCO3− uptake (6Ohkawa H. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggested that CO2 uptake is energized differently from HCO3− uptake. The presence of an ATP-dependent HCO3−transporter in Synechococcus PCC7942 has been recently demonstrated (13Omata T. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Okamura M. Gohta S. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In an attempt to see if there are functionally distinct NDH-1 complexes, we constructed double mutants ofSynechocystis sp. PCC6803 by disrupting highly homologousndhD genes in pairs and analyzed their growth under various conditions, CO2 uptake and redox levels of P700 and plastoquinone (PQ) pool. The results suggested the presence of two types of functionally distinct NDH-1 complexes, one essential for photoheterotrophic growth of the cells and the other essential for CO2 uptake.DISCUSSIONThe ability of cells to grow under photoheterotrophic conditions strongly depends on their respiratory activity. TheΔndhD1/D2 and M55 mutants, which exhibited low respiration rates, were unable to grow under photoheterotrophic conditions (Fig. 1 and Table II). Reduction of the PQ pool and P700 was also strongly inhibited in these mutants (Figs. 3 and 4). This indicated that the NdhD1·NdhD2 type of NDH-1 complexes mediates the transport of electrons from NADPH to the PQ pool and thereby to P700, thus constituting a PSI-dependent cyclic electron transport pathway. The NdhD3·NdhD4 and NdhD5·NdhD6 types of NDH-1 complexes also contribute to this reaction, as seen from the higher oxidation levels of P700 in ΔndhD3/D4 andΔndhD5/D6 than in the wild-type under FR light (Fig. 3). The contribution of these complexes of NDH-1 to the PSI-dependent cyclic electron transport appears to be much smaller than that of the NdhD1·NdhD2 NDH-1 complexes (Figs. 3 and 4, Table II).The absence of the rapid increase in the fluorescence yield inΔndhD1/D2 and M55 upon addition of KCN suggested that this fluorescence increase reflects the electron donation to the PQ pool mediated by the NdhD1·NdhD2 NDH-1 complexes (Fig. 4). This contradicts the report by Cooley et al. (22Cooley J.W. Howitt C.A. Vermaas W.F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that the rapid fluorescence increase reflects the reduction of the PQ pool mediated by SDH. It appears possible that inactivation of SDH led to decreased formation of NADPH, thereby decreasing the NDH-1-dependent reduction of the PQ pool. Adversely, inactivation of NDH-1 might lead to the decrease of succinate formation. Inactivation of ndhB or ndhD1 plusndhD2 had much stronger effect on the fluorescence increase than the inactivation of sll1625 plus sll0823(Fig. 4; also see Fig. 6 in Ref. 22Cooley J.W. Howitt C.A. Vermaas W.F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and hence, we prefer the former possibility.Among the single and double ndhD mutants constructed in this and previous studies (5Ohkawa H. Sonoda M. Katoh H. Ogawa T. Can. J. Bot. 1998; 76: 1035-1042Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Ohkawa H. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), only ΔndhD3/D4showed the accentuated phenotype of M55 (i.e. complete loss of CO2 uptake activity). It is evident that inability of these mutants to grow under low CO2 conditions is a result of inactivation of their CO2 uptake activity (Figs. 1 and2) and that only the NdhD3·NdhD4 NDH-1 complexes are essential for CO2 uptake. We have previously proposed a model in which ATP produced by NDH-1-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport drives the “transport” of CO2 (23Ogawa T. Katoh A. Sonoda M. Satoh K. Murata N. Stress Responses of Photosynthetic Organisms. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1998Google Scholar). However, inactivation of ndhD1 and ndhD2, which are essential to the PSI cyclic electron transport, did not have any significant effect on CO2 uptake (Fig. 2). Thus, this previous model appears to be unlikely.The mechanism of CO2 uptake and the role of NdhD3·NdhD4 NDH-1 complex types in CO2 uptake are not known. The CO2 uptake reaction is postulated to be an energy-dependent unidirectional conversion of CO2 to HCO3− (11Kaplan A. Reinhold L. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 539-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 24Volokita M. Zenvirth D. Kaplan A. Reinhold L. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Kaplan and Reinhold proposed a model in which an “alkaline pocket” produced in the light functions as a converter of CO2 to HCO3− (11Kaplan A. Reinhold L. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 539-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The information presented in this paper does allow for limited speculation on how a particular type of NDH-1 complex might be specifically involved in CO2uptake. A vectorial carbonic anhydrase-like reaction could be closely associated with the NdhD3·NdhD4 NDH-1 complex type such that OH− ions might be produced in a “localized pocket” and used to drive the conversion of CO2 to HCO3−. Such a pocket could be produced at the site(s) of protonation of NADP and/or PQ, and a relatively high electron transfer rate would be required to account for the high CO2 uptake rate. The low rate of electron transfer from NADPH to PQ pool in the ΔndhD3/D4 mutant would suggest that the NdhD3·NdhD4 NDH-1 complexes donate electrons mainly to an alternate electron acceptor. Further studies are in progress to identify the electron acceptor.In a previous paper, the following phenotypes were reported to characterize the ndhB-less mutant (M55) ofSynechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 (7Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). 1) It grows very slowly under air and is unable to take up CO2, 2) it is unable to grow under photoheterotrophic conditions, and 3) it has a low respiration rate. The first phenotype was observed in theΔndhD3/D4 mutant described in this study and the second and third phenotypes were found for theΔndhD1/D2 mutant (Figs. 1 and 2, Table II). Thus, it appears evident that there are two types of functionally distinct NDH-1 complexes in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, and M55 exhibits the phenotype of both types of the mutants. The presence of the homologues of the six ndhD genes in the genome ofAnabaena sp. PCC7120 (the Web, CyanoBase) andSynechococcus sp. PCC7002 (4Klughammer B.D. Sültemeyer D. Badger M.R. Price G.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1316-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the presence of the two types of functionally distinct NDH-1 complexes is common among various strains of cyanobacteria. The Type I NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (NDH-1)1 in cyanobacteria is involved in both the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains (1Schmetterer G. Bryant D. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 409-435Crossref Google Scholar). The whole genome sequence data base forSynechocystis sp. PCC6803 has shown the presence of genes for 12 subunits of NDH-1 with the large, hydrophobic NdhB, NdhD, and NdhF subunits being core membrane components (2Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A.

It is evident that inability of these mutants to grow under low CO2 conditions is a result of inactivation of their CO2 uptake activity (Figs. 1 and2) and that only the NdhD3·NdhD4 NDH-1 complexes are essential for CO2 uptake. We have previously proposed a model in which ATP produced by NDH-1-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport drives the “transport” of CO2 (23Ogawa T. Katoh A. Sonoda M. Satoh K. Murata N. Stress Responses of Photosynthetic Organisms. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1998Google Scholar). However, inactivation of ndhD1 and ndhD2, which are essential to the PSI cyclic electron transport, did not have any significant effect on CO2 uptake (Fig. 2). Thus, this previous model appears to be unlikely. The mechanism of CO2 uptake and the role of NdhD3·NdhD4 NDH-1 complex types in CO2 uptake are not known. The CO2 uptake reaction is postulated to be an energy-dependent unidirectional conversion of CO2 to HCO3− (11Kaplan A. Reinhold L. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 539-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 24Volokita M. Zenvirth D. Kaplan A. Reinhold L. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Kaplan and Reinhold proposed a model in which an “alkaline pocket” produced in the light functions as a converter of CO2 to HCO3− (11Kaplan A. Reinhold L. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 539-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The information presented in this paper does allow for limited speculation on how a particular type of NDH-1 complex might be specifically involved in CO2uptake. A vectorial carbonic anhydrase-like reaction could be closely associated with the NdhD3·NdhD4 NDH-1 complex type such that OH− ions might be produced in a “localized pocket” and used to drive the conversion of CO2 to HCO3−. Such a pocket could be produced at the site(s) of protonation of NADP and/or PQ, and a relatively high electron transfer rate would be required to account for the high CO2 uptake rate. The low rate of electron transfer from NADPH to PQ pool in the ΔndhD3/D4 mutant would suggest that the NdhD3·NdhD4 NDH-1 complexes donate electrons mainly to an alternate electron acceptor. Further studies are in progress to identify the electron acceptor. In a previous paper, the following phenotypes were reported to characterize the ndhB-less mutant (M55) ofSynechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 (7Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). 1) It grows very slowly under air and is unable to take up CO2, 2) it is unable to grow under photoheterotrophic conditions, and 3) it has a low respiration rate. The first phenotype was observed in theΔndhD3/D4 mutant described in this study and the second and third phenotypes were found for theΔndhD1/D2 mutant (Figs. 1 and 2, Table II). Thus, it appears evident that there are two types of functionally distinct NDH-1 complexes in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, and M55 exhibits the phenotype of both types of the mutants. The presence of the homologues of the six ndhD genes in the genome ofAnabaena sp. PCC7120 (the Web, CyanoBase) andSynechococcus sp. PCC7002 (4Klughammer B.D. Sültemeyer D. Badger M.R. Price G.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1316-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the presence of the two types of functionally distinct NDH-1 complexes is common among various strains of cyanobacteria."

Their catalytic domain was identical to that of PDE11A1 (490 amino acids) reported during the course of this study. However, the cDNAs we isolated had N termini distinct from PDE11A1, indicating two novel N-terminal variants of PDE11A. PDE11A3 cDNA encoded a 684-amino acid protein including one complete and one incomplete GAF domain in the N-terminal region. PDE11A4 was composed of 934 amino acids including two complete GAF domains and shared 630 C-terminal amino acids with PDE11A3 but had a distinct N terminus containing the putative phosphorylation sites for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. PDE11A3 transcripts were specifically expressed in testis, whereas PDE11A4 transcripts were particularly abundant in prostate. Recombinant PDE11A4 expressed in COS-7 cells hydrolyzed cAMP and cGMP with K m values of 3.0 and 1.4 μm, respectively, and the V maxvalue with cAMP was almost twice that with cGMP. Although PDE11A3 showed the same K m values as PDE11A4, the relativeV max values of PDE11A3 were approximately one-sixth of those of PDE11A4. PDE11A4, but not PDE11A3, was phosphorylated by both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases in vitro. Thus, the PDE11A gene undergoes tissue-specific alternative splicing that generates structurally and functionally distinct gene products. cDNAs encoding a novel phosphodiesterase, phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A), were isolated by a combination of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotide primers and rapid amplification of cDNA ends.

PDE2 is stimulated by cGMP and hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP, while PDE3 is cGMP-inhibited. The cAMP-specific and rolipram-sensitive PDEs belong to the PDE4 family.

Some of these PDEs constitute subfamilies encoded by distinct genes. In each PDE family, alternative splice variants have been reported (1Beavo J.A. Physiol.

PDEs encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs have been reported to differ in their regulation by some kinases including cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK) and cGMP-dependent kinase (cGK) and associated proteins (19Degerman E.

Each PDE is involved in controlling cyclic nucleotide levels and probably plays a distinct physiological role in different tissues and cells. The hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides is multiply controlled by PDEs co-existing in the same cells. Therefore, the finding and characterization of novel PDEs could lead to better understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms of cyclic nucleotide-mediated cellular functions. Novel PDEs may also be valuable as pharmacologically significant targets. cDNA cloning of PDE8s, PDE9A, and PDE10A was done by an approach using bioinformatics (4Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A.

A search of data bases of expressed sequence tags was performed using parts of PDE sequences, such as the catalytic domain. The approach was shown to be effective, but not always successful, for the cDNA cloning of a novel PDE. Only the sequences submitted in the expressed sequence tag data bases could be cloned by this procedure. To isolate novel PDE cDNAs, which have not yet appeared in the expressed sequence tag data bases, we employed an approach using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with degenerate primers designed from a conserved sequence in the PDE catalytic domain and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) for the isolation of full-length cDNAs. Unique N-terminal splicing variants of human PDE11A were obtained, and their tissue-specific expression patterns were examined. The expression plasmids encoding two PDE11A variants were transfected into COS-7 cells, and the enzymatic properties of the recombinant proteins were investigated in detail. Restriction endonucleases, DNA-modifying enzymes, 5′-Full RACE Core Set, and LA PCR™ Kit version 2.1 were obtained from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]ATP, [3H]cAMP, [3H]cGMP, and Hybond-N+ nylon membrane were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax was purchased from Invitrogen. The GeneAmp RNA PCR Core kit was a product of PE Biosystems. SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit; Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (human prostate and testis); human multiple-tissue expression (MTE™) array; human multiple-tissue cDNA (MTC™) panels I and II; Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix; and human mRNAs from testis, thyroid, prostate, and hippocampus were purchased from CLONTECH. Dipyridamole, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine, and zaprinast were from Sigma. SCH51866, milrinone, rolipram, and E4021 were synthesized at Tanabe Seiyaku Co. Ltd., Japan. The nucleotide sequence was determined by an automated DNA sequencer ABI PRISM™ 310 and a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit (PE Biosystems). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence data were analyzed by the computer programs GENETYX (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). Two degenerate, oppositely oriented oligonucleotide PCR primers were designed based on actual nucleic acid sequences deduced from the most probable codons for the amino acid sequences in two highly conserved catalytic domains of a variety of PDEs (Fig.1 A). First-strand cDNA was prepared from the human testis and hippocampus mRNAs according to the instructions of the GeneAmp RNA PCR Core kit. PCR was carried out through 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were cloned into the TA cloning vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega), and the nucleotide sequences were then determined and compared with those of PDEs previously reported. 5′-RACE was performed using 5′-Full RACE Core Set and Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (human prostate and testis). First, PCR template was prepared with the human testis mRNA, a specific antisense primer (5′-CTGCTTCAAAAGCTG-3′) designed from the nucleotide sequence of clone t21, and 5′-Full RACE Core Set. PCR was carried out using the LA PCR Kit and two primer sets, 5′-ATGATCCTTCAAAGTGAGGGTCAC-3′ plus 5′-GGTAGCAGAGGTTCCATAGAGTTG-3′ for first amplification and 5′-GGTCACAATATCTTTGCTAACCTG-3′ plus 5′-CTTAGCTTGGAAGGCATTGTTGGT-3′ for second amplification. The PCR products were cloned and determined for the nucleotide sequence as described above. Further 5′-upstream regions were obtained using Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (human prostate and testis). For the amplification of the 5′-region of PDE11A3 (nucleotides 45–468), Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (human testis) and primer sets A (AP1 primer plus 5′-GTCAGTCTGTTCTTCAAAGAGGTC-3′ for first amplification and AP2 primer plus 5′-TGAGGCAGCAAAGAGCTGAGCGTT-3′ for second amplification) were used. For the cloning of further 5′-upstream region (nucleotides 1–309 of PDE11A3), primer sets B (AP1 primer plus 5′-AGCGTTAGATATGGCGATTCCACA-3′ for first amplification and AP2 primer plus 5′-TGTCTTGTATCCAGTTAGCTTGTC-3′ for second amplification) were employed. For the amplification of the 5′-region of PDE11A4 (nucleotides 1–1524), Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (human prostate) and primer sets (AP1 primer plus 5′-TCTGACACCAGAGGGATGTTGGCT-3′ for first amplification and AP2 primer plus 5′-GTCAGTCTGTTCTTCAAAGAGGTC-3′ for second amplification) were used. 3′-RACE was performed using the SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification kit with human thyroid mRNA according to the instructions. PCR was performed with 3′-SMART cDNA, two primer sets (UPM primer plus 5′-ACCAACAATGCCTTCCAAGCTAAG-3′ for first PCR and NUP primer plus 5′-TTCCAAGCTAAGAGTGGCTCTGCC-3′ for second PCR), and Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix. Finally, two splice variants of PDE11A were obtained as shown in Fig. 1 B. In all RACE, reaction cycles were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min; five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min; five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min; and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy and sequenced. To detect the mRNAs coding for PDE11A3 and PDE11A4 in human testis and prostate, respectively, and to isolate the PCR error-free PDE11A cDNAs, RT-PCR was performed. First strand cDNA was synthesized from human testis or prostate mRNAs using random hexamers at 42 °C for 60 min according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Gene Amp RNA PCR Core kit. The cDNA synthesized from human testis mRNAs and the primer set (the 5′-primer 5′-GCGCTTGCAGCCCAGGGC-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-TCAGGCTGTAGTCATTTTGCAGC-3′ (covering nucleotides 1–2195 of PDE11A3 cDNA)) were used for PCR of PDE11A3. The cDNA synthesized from human prostate mRNAs and the primer set (the 5′-primer 5′-TGGCGCTGAACTGGGAATACTGGTG-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-TCAGGCTGTAGTCATTTTGCAGC-3′ (covering nucleotides 204–3164 of PDE11A4 cDNA)) were used for PCR of PDE11A4. PCR was carried out with conditions of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy. Six independent PCR clones of PDE11A3 or PDE11A4 were sequenced to verify the correct cDNA sequence. One of the clones, pGEM-PDE11A3F or pGEM-PDE11A4F, was used for further experiments. Human MTE™ Array (CLONTECH) and Gene Hunter™ (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) were hybridized with a 32P-labeled DNA probe prepared using cDNA encoding a common region of PDE11As (nucleotides 1237–1801 of PDE11A4). Hybridization and washing were performed as described previously (24Yuasa K. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4897-4905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The membranes were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 3 days. To examine expression patterns of human PDE11A3 and PDE11A4 transcripts in human tissues, PCR was performed using MTC panels (CLONTECH) as templates and Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix. The cDNA fragments encoding PDE11A3 (amino acid residues 21–272) were produced using the 5′-primer 5′-AAGGTGAAAATCACAAGACTGGTC-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-GTGGTTGCTATTCCAAATAGGGAC-3′. The cDNA fragments encoding human PDE11A4 (amino acid residues 271–522) were produced using the 5′-primer 5′-AGCACAGAGAACTCAAATGAGGTG-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-GTGGTTGCTATTCCAAATAGGGAC-3′. PCR was carried out through 32 or 27 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the fractions were transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane. To confirm that PCR products were derived from human PDE11A transcripts, we detected both PCR products by Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled DNA probe prepared from an oligonucleotide (TGTGGAATCGCCATATCTAACGCT) coding for a common region of the human PDE11A cDNAs. Hybridization was performed in 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and the 32P-labeled probe at 55 °C for 2 h. All blots were washed finally in 6× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 55 °C for 15 min. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 1 day. All of the PCR reactions were performed under conditions in which each amplification did not reach saturation. To generate an expression plasmid of PDE11A3, PCR was performed using the 5′-primer 5′-GGATCCATGCTGAAGCAGGCAAG-3′, the 3′-primer 5′-TTCATCATCTTCAGTAAATGG-3′ (covering amino acid residues 1–106 of PDE11A3), and pGEM-PDE11A3F as a template. The amplified cDNA fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy, resulting in pGEM-PDE11A3BM, and then confirmed by sequencing. TheSacI–EcoRV and EcoRV–SalI DNA fragments of pGEM-PDE11A3F, and theBamHI–SacI DNA fragment of pGEM-PDE11A3BM were subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA4/HisMax (pHis), resulting in pHis-PDE11A3. To generate a mammalian expression plasmid of human PDE11A4, PCR was performed using the 5′-primer 5′-GGATCCATGGCAGCCTCC-3′, the 3′-primer 5′-CCTTAGCTCTTTCTGAGAAGCTC-3′ (covering amino acid residues 1–122 of PDE11A4), and pGEM-PDE11A4F as a template. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy, resulting in pGEM-PDE11A4BM, and then confirmed by sequencing. The KpnI–SalI DNA fragment of pGEM-PDE11A4F and the BamHI–KpnI DNA fragment of pGEM-PDE11A4BM were subcloned into the BamHI andXhoI sites of the mammalian expression vector, the pHis, resulting in pHis-PDE11A4. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and were serially passaged before reaching confluence. The expression plasmid pHis-PDE11A3 or pHis-PDE11A4 was transfected into COS-7 cells by LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in ice-cold homogenization buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell suspension was disrupted by a sonicator (TOMY Seiko, Japan) for 15 s (three times with 1-min intervals), and the homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was added to a plastic tube containing nickel nitrilotriacetate resin (QIAGEN), equilibrated with the homogenization buffer, and incubated by rotation at 4 °C for 4 h. The nickel nitrilotriacetate resin was poured into a plastic column (0.8 × 5 cm) and allowed to drain. The packed resin was washed with wash buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mmbenzamidine, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and the proteins were then eluted by elution buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm benzamidine, 200 mm NaCl, 200 mmimidazole, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After PDE assay, the PDE11A fractions were diluted with glycerol at a final concentration of 50% and stored at −25 °C until use. The PDE assay was performed by the radiolabeled nucleotide method as described previously (9Fujishige K. Kotera J. Michibata H. Yuasa K. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Omori K. J. Biol.

Relative concentrations of PDE11A proteins expressed in COS-7 cells were calculated by immunoblotting with anti-Xpress polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), as we described previously (25Yuasa K. Michibata H. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37429-37434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with ECL reagents at room temperature for 1 min and then exposed to x-ray film for 2–10 s, under conditions in which each exposure to x-ray film did not reach saturation. The resultant films were scanned by ARCUS II (Agfa-Gevaert), and quantitated using the Quantity One program (PDI, Inc.). The optical densities versus the amount of pHis-encoded protein were plotted to measure the relative concentrations of PDE11A proteins. Relative V max values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots (26Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (8064) Google Scholar), using proteins that provided relatively equal enzymatic activity. The protein concentration of the cytosolic fractions of transfected COS-7 cells was determined by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The full-length bovine cGK Iα cDNA was a gift from Dr. Thomas M. Lincoln (University of Alabama at Birmingham). The full-length human cGK Iβ cDNA and mouse cAK catalytic subunit α cDNA were obtained by standard PCR protocol as we described previously (25Yuasa K. Michibata H. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37429-37434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pHis. To prepare truncated and constitutively active cGK I (cGK IΔ) (27Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), thePstI–SalI DNA fragment of human cGK Iβ (covering amino acid residues 322–685) was subcloned into thePstI and XhoI sites of pHis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. To introduce the desired mutations, the following primers were used: 5′-CTGCAGCGGAGAGCTGCTCAGAAAGAGCTAAGG-3′ plus 5′-CCTTAGCTCTTTCTGAGCAGCTCTCCGCTGCAG-3′ (PDE11A4 S117A); and 5′-CTTCTCCGGAAGGCAGCCTCCCTGCCCCCCACC-3′ plus 5′-GGTGGGGGGCAGGGAGGCTGCCTTCCGGAGAAG-3′ (PDE11A4 S162A). In each case, the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. The full-length cGK Iα, cGK Iβ, cAK, or truncated cGK I cDNAs in the expression vector pHis were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and scraped in an ice-cold TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were incubated with anti-Xpress antibody and protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C by rotation. The beads were washed three times with TNE buffer, and the immunoprecipitated samples were used for the in vitro kinase assay. Likewise, cell extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with either pHis-PDE11A3 or pHis-PDE11A4 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibody. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (25Yuasa K. Michibata H. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37429-37434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in the presence or absence of cGMP (5 μm final concentration). Phosphorylation by cAK was performed in the same buffer but in the presence or absence of 5 μm PKI (5–24). The cyclic nucleotide binding assay was performed in a total volume of 200 μl by a modified version of the methods described previously (10Kotera J. Fujishige K. Akatsuka H. Imai Y. Yanaka N.

The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA), and then applied to a Millipore HAWP filter (pore size 0.45 μm). The filters were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and then counted on a scintillation counter. As a positive control, pHis-PDE5A, a human PDE5A1 cDNA (29Yanaka N. Kotera J. Ohtsuka A. Akatsuka H. Imai Y. Michibata H. Fujishige K. Kawai E. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pHis, was created and transfected into COS-7 cells. In all experiments, nonspecific binding was measured by incubation in the presence of 2 mm unlabeled cGMP or cAMP. To isolate novel human PDE cDNAs, PCR was performed using cDNA templates from several human tissues with degenerate PCR primers designed from two highly conserved regions in the catalytic domain (Fig.1 A). PCR products of the appropriate size (approximately 200 base pairs) were detected, subcloned into the TA-cloning vector pGEM-T Easy, and sequenced. Of 50 clones obtained from human testis PCR products, one clone, t21, was revealed to contain deduced amino acid sequence similar to but distinct from 10 PDE families previously described. It showed 52, 51, and 54% identity in amino acid sequences with PDE2A, PDE5A, and PDE10A, respectively. The insert DNA was used as a probe for human Northern blot and mRNA dot blot analyses, and the preliminary data suggested that the corresponding transcripts were rich in prostate, testis, and thyroid (data not shown). To obtain a full-length cDNA, 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions were performed using human testis, prostate, and thyroid mRNAs and primers designed from the clone t21 sequence. Two kinds of extended products having distinct 5′-sequences were obtained. One was isolated from human prostate RT products, and the other was from those of human testis. The nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that our clones contained a catalytic sequence identical to that of PDE11A1 (30Fawcett L. Baxendale R. Stacey P. McGrouther C. Harrow I. Soderling S.

As shown in Fig.1 B, the shorter clone obtained from human testis was designated as PDE11A3 and the longer clone from prostate as PDE11A4, according to the nomenclature of the 1994 American Society of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Conference (31Beavo J.A.

Beavo, personal communication. The nucleotide sequence of the full-length PDE11A4 cDNA (4476 base pairs) is shown in Fig. 2 A. An open reading frame (ORF) of 2802 nucleotides spanned from the first initiation codon ATG to the termination codon TGA (nucleotides 319–3120), and an in-frame stop codon was located 66 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon. The complete ORF encoded a protein of 934 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 104,809 Da. The first methionine is surrounded by a Kozak consensus sequence, ACCATGG (32Kozak M.

In an effort to understand the evolutionary process and the molecular basis of cold adaptation, we have used directed evolution to convert a mesophilic subtilisin-like protease from Bacillus sphaericus, SSII, into its psychrophilic counterpart. A single round of random mutagenesis followed by recombination of improved variants yielded a mutant, P3C9, with a catalytic rate constant (k cat) at 10 °C 6.6 times and a catalytic efficiency (k cat/K M) 9.6 times that of wild type. Its half-life at 70 °C is 3.3 times less than wild type. Although there is a trend toward decreasing stability during the progression from mesophile to psychrophile, there is not a strict correlation between decreasing stability and increasing low temperature activity. A first generation mutant with a >2-fold increase in k cat is actually more stable than wild type. This suggests that the ultimate decrease in stability may be due to random drift rather than a physical incompatibility between low temperature activity and high temperature stability. SSII shares 77.4% identity with the naturally psychrophilic protease subtilisin S41. Although SSII and S41 differ at 85 positions, four amino acid substitutions were sufficient to generate an SSII whose low temperature activity is greater than that of S41.

Typically, the rate of a biochemical reaction decreases 2–3-fold when the temperature is lowered by 10 °C. The activity of an enzyme will thus be 16–80 times lower at 0 °C compared with 37 °C (1Gerday C. Aittaleb M. Arpigny J.L. Baise E. Chessa J.P. Garsoux G. Petrescu I. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Despite this, organisms native to cold environments achieve metabolic rates that are sufficient for survival and growth (2Hochachka P.W. Somero G.N. Biochemical Adaptation. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1984Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, enzymes isolated from cold-adapted organisms are generally more active at low temperatures (<10 °C) than their mesophilic homologs (1Gerday C. Aittaleb M. Arpigny J.L. Baise E.

Uncovering the molecular basis of cold adaptation is of considerable interest for the insight it may provide into the nature of enzymatic catalysis as well as for potential biotechnology applications. Studies thus far have focused chiefly on comparisons of naturally occurring psychrophilic enzymes with their mesophilic counterparts. Such studies are complicated by the large evolutionary distances that separate natural homologs adapted to different temperatures. A large fraction of the amino acid substitutions may be neutral; others may reflect adaptation to other environmental conditions (e.g. high salt concentrations). Ignorance of the selective pressures under which the enzymes evolved further obscures attempts to identify specific adaptive mechanisms (5Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N.

More recently, directed evolution has been used to investigate mechanisms of temperature adaptation. In particular, random mutagenesis combined with screening or selection has successfully generated cold-adapted variants from mesophilic enzymes (7Taguchi S. Ozaki A. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Momose H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Merz A. Yee M. Szadowski H. Pappenberger G. Crameri A. Stemmer W.P. Yanofsky C. Kirschner K.

Here we describe the directed evolution of low temperature activity in a mesophilic enzyme, subtilisin SSII, from the tropical bacteriumBacillus sphaericus. SSII has a high degree of sequence similarity to other known subtilisins from psychrophilic (10Wati M.R. Thanabalu T. Porter A.G. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 195-200Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) sources (Fig. 1). SSII shows high sequence identity (77.4%) with a psychrophilic subtilisin, S41, from the Antarctic bacterium Bacillus TA41. SSII and S41 share several extended loop regions not found in other subtilisins. S41 contains a large number of hydrophilic residues, particularly 22 Asp residues, that are predicted to be located mainly on the surface of the enzyme (12Davail S. Feller G. Narinx E. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17448-17453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inserted loop regions and the unusually large number of charged surface residues are thought to be characteristic of psychrophilic enzymes (1Gerday C. Aittaleb M. Arpigny J.L. Baise E. Chessa J.P. Garsoux G. Petrescu I. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1342: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 12Davail S. Feller G. Narinx E. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17448-17453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SSII also contains an unusually large number of Asp residues (19DelMar E.G. Largman C. Brodick J.W. Geokas M.C. Anal. Chem. 1979; 99: 316-320Google Scholar), many of them located at the same positions as in S41 (Fig. 1). Despite its high sequence similarity with S41, however, SSII displays no psychrophilic behavior; both its low temperature activity and high temperature stability are similar to those of mesophilic subtilisins such as BPN′. In previous work (5Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we increased the stability of the psychrophilic subtilisin S41 while simultaneously maintaining its activity at low temperature, demonstrating that high thermostability is not necessarily incompatible with high catalytic activity at low temperatures. To complement the evolution of psychrophilic S41 to function at high temperature, here we investigated the adaptation of mesophilic SSII to low temperatures. The particular screening strategy required an increase in the low temperature activity of the mesophilic enzyme while allowing stability to vary. In this way we could directly probe a hypothetical process by which a mesophilic enzyme would adapt to function at low temperatures. The extremely high identity of the mesophilic SSII with the natural psychrophilic S41 facilitates comparison of the solutions to the challenge of cold adaptation that are discovered in the laboratory with those that are found in nature. Subtilisin SSII was expressed inBacillus subtilis from the Escherichia coli-Bacillus shuttle vector pSPH2R that contains the prosequence of subtilisin S41 and the pre-prosequence of subtilisin BPN′ (17Miyazaki K. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The first generation library was generated by error-prone PCR.1 SSII was amplified from pSPH2R with the primers 5′-GGATAACCAATTGTTCCTTGCGC-3′ and 5′-AAAGACTTTACAGGTGCGACAAC-3′. The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 10 μl of 10× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm(NH4)SO4, 0.1% (v/v) Triton® X-100) with 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mmMnCl2, 5 μl each of 4 mm dATP and dGTP, 5 μl each of 20 mm dTTP and dCTP, 5 μm each primer, ∼5 ng of plasmid, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The PCR schedule was 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 14 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. PCR was carried out on an MJ Research (Watertown, MA) thermal cycler (PTC-200). The product was purified using QiaquickTM (Qiagen, Santa Clarita CA) and restriction- digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The digested product was purified and ligated into pSPH2R with T4 DNA ligase. In vitro recombination of improved variants was accomplished using the staggered extension process (StEP) (18Zhao H. Giver L. Affholter J. Arnold F.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 14: 258-261Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The 50-μl reaction mixture contained 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 5 μl of 2 mm dNTP mix, 5 μm of each primer, 2 ng of each plasmid, 2.5 μl of H2O, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). The PCR schedule consisted of 5 min at 95 °C followed by 70 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 55 °C for 5 s. In order to facilitate high efficiency transformation in Bacillus, an E. colishuttle vector was employed (17Miyazaki K. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Ligations of library DNA were transformed into competent E. coli (strain HB101) by electroporation and grown on plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were scraped from the plates, and the DNA was purified using Qiagen minipreps. This DNA was used to transform competent B. subtilis (protease-deficient strain DB428). Transformation mixtures were grown on 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Single colonies were picked using sterile toothpicks and placed in 96-well plates containing 2× YT media (per liter: 16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl) with 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml kanamycin (1 ml per well) and grown in a shaking incubator for 48 h at 37 °C, 300 rpm. After growth, cells were pelleted by spinning at 5000 × g, and 10 μl of supernatant was transferred to replica 96-well plates. The replica plates were cooled in a 10 °C cold room for 15 min. After cooling, 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (AAPF) (Sigma), pH 8.5, was added to the wells. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 min and then stopped by the addition of 100 μl of isopropyl alcohol. Product formation was assessed by reading the absorbance at 405 nm in a 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Transformed Bacilluscultures were grown in a shaking incubator at 37 °C, 300 rpm, in 1 liter of 2× YT medium with 10 mm CaCl2 and 50 μg/ml kanamycin for 70 h. Cultures were chilled on ice and centrifuged at 5000 × g to pellet the cells. Supernatant was adjusted to 88 g/liter NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 88 g/liter NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6 (buffer A). The column was washed in buffer A until no further change in absorbance at 280 nm was seen. Protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 30 g/liter NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 15% isopropyl alcohol, pH 7.6. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to ∼2 ml using an Amicon concentrator (Millipore, Burlington, MA) and dialyzed overnight against 2.5 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, pH 7.6. Protein was then applied to a Superdex G-50 column and eluted at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions showing activity toward AAPF were pooled. Protein purity was estimated to be >95% by mass spectrometry. Proteolytic activity was determined on the small synthetic peptide substrate AAPF by monitoring the formation of released p-nitroaniline at 410 nm in a thermostatted Shimadzu (Columbia, MD) BioSpec-1601 spectrophotometer. The reaction buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPPS-NaOH (Calbiochem), pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2. Concentration of the substrate was determined using an extinction coefficient ε315 = 14,000m−1 cm−1(19DelMar E.G. Largman C. Brodick J.W. Geokas M.C. Anal. Chem. 1979; 99: 316-320Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient ε280 = 47,578m−1 cm−1calculated according to Pace et al (20Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray V. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants for wild-type SSII and mutants were determined from a series of initial rates at different concentrations of AAPF over the range of 0.02–1.4 mm that bracketed K M. Reported values are the average of three measurements. The standard deviations do not exceed 10%. Half-lives of irreversible thermal inactivation upon autolysis were determined at 70 °C in 50 mm HEPPS-NaOH, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 using 2 μm enzyme. At various time intervals, 10-μl aliquots were removed and diluted into 1 ml of an assay solution (50 mm HEPPS-NaOH, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm AAPF) for the measurement of residual activity at 30 °C. Reported values are the averages of at least two measurements. The standard deviations do not exceed 10%. Dependence of thermal inactivation times at 60 °C on calcium concentration was determined using identical conditions except that the concentration of CaCl2 in the enzyme solution was varied (concentrations were 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 1.0, and 10 mm). Curves oft 12 versus [CaCl2] were fit to the theoretical binding curve for a single site:pCa2+ = pK a + log(E/E − Ca2+) (21Pantoliano M.W. Whitlow M. Wood J.F. Rollence M.L. Finzel B.C. Gilliland G.L. Poulos T.L. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional structural model of SSII was constructed based on its homology with subtilisins Carlsberg, Savinase, BPN′, and thermitase. Coordinates (Carlsberg, code 1CSE (22Bode W.

Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments and model construction and refinement were carried out using the homology module of the INSIGHT II molecular modeling software package (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA). Screening ∼3000 mutants from a first generation library prepared by error-prone PCR of SSII identified three variants (labeled P2G8, P7E1, and P7C10) with improved activity at 10 °C. StEP recombination of these variants and screening the resulting library yielded a fourth variant, P3C9, whose catalytic efficiency at 10 °C is ∼9.6 times greater than wild type toward the peptide substrate AAPF (Fig.2). Kinetic parameters for wild-type SSII and the four variants are given in TableI. Most of the observed increases in low temperature activity come from increases ink cat; only P7C10 shows a significant decrease inK M. The k cat of the recombined variant P3C9 is ∼6.6 times that of wild type. Thek cat of P3C9 is ∼4.5 times that of S41 at 10 °C.Table IStability and activity parameters for SSII wild type and mutantsVariantAmino acid substitution(s)t 1/2(70 °C)k catK Ms −1mmWild type13.515.70.28P2G8T253A11.061.10.39P7E1K11R19.234.80.33I246LP7C10D98N5.721.00.14S110FP3C9T253A4.11040.19K11RD98NS110FHalf-lives at 70 °C and kinetic parameters at 10 °C for wild-type SSII and its cold-active variants were measured on the peptide substrate AAPF in 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPPS, pH 8.5.

Standard deviations do not exceed 10%. Amino acid substitutions found in the cold-active variants of SSII are listed in Table I. Five substitutions were found in the first generation variants, four of which are present in the recombination product P3C9. The absent mutation, Ile-246 → Leu, accompanied Lys-11 → Arg in P7E1 and may not be present in P3C9 because it is neutral with respect to cold activity. However, residue 246 is only seven amino acids away from 253, a mutation site in another cold-active variant.In vitro recombination methods such as StEP or DNA shuffling (27Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) often fail to recombine mutations that are so close to one another (28Volkov, A., Shao, Z., and Arnold, F. H. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar). It is therefore also possible that Ile-246 → Leu is cold-activating but is not found in P3C9 because it was not successfully recombined. Inactivation profiles at 70 °C for wild-type SSII and the stable variant p7E1 are shown in Fig. 3. Inactivation profiles were well fit by a single exponential, indicating that thermal inactivation is a first order process under the conditions employed. Half-lives at 70 °C are given in Table I. Based on sequence homology with subtilisins of known structure, SSII is predicted to have two calcium-binding sites, a high affinity site that in other subtilisins is essential for activity (21Pantoliano M.W. Whitlow M. Wood J.F. Rollence M.L. Finzel B.C. Gilliland G.L. Poulos T.L. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and a low affinity site that is important for thermal stability (21Pantoliano M.W. Whitlow M. Wood J.F. Rollence M.L. Finzel B.C. Gilliland G.L. Poulos T.L. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Ligands for the low affinity site in SSII should include Ala-181 (Lys-170 in BPN′), Asp-223 (Glu-195 in BPN′), Glu-225 (Asp-197 in BPN′), Arg-275 (Arg-247 in BPN′), and Gln-279 (Glu-251 in BPN′). It has been noted that enzymes from psychrophilic organisms generally exhibit weaker affinity for stabilizing ions such as calcium than their mesophilic cousins (10Wati M.R. Thanabalu T. Porter A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1352: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,29Feller G. Payan F. Theys F. Qian M. Haser R. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that the psychrophilic subtilisins S41 and S39 can both be stabilized significantly by increasing their affinity for calcium (5Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 30Narinx E. Baise E. Gerday C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In order to probe the relationship between increased low temperature activity and calcium affinity in SSII, the half-life at 60 °C was determined as a function of calcium concentration for wild type and P3C9 (Fig.4). As expected, increasing the calcium concentration decreases the rate of thermal inactivation. The dependence of half-life on calcium concentration follows a roughly sigmoidal curve. Assuming that the midpoint of the curve is related to the affinity of the enzyme for calcium (21Pantoliano M.W. Whitlow M. Wood J.F. Rollence M.L. Finzel B.C. Gilliland G.L. Poulos T.L. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), we see that the calcium affinity of P3C9 does not differ greatly from that of wild type (midpoints occur at pCa values of 4.1 for wild typeversus 3.8 for P3C9). The specific activity of P3C9 relative to wild-type SSII is shown in Fig.5 as a function of temperature. Kinetic parameters for wild type, P3C9, and the natural psychrophile S41 at different temperatures are given in TableII. P3C9 is more active than its mesophilic counterpart SSII over the entire range of temperatures where it is stable. However, the relative superiority of P3C9 over wild type is temperature-dependent. At 10 °C, P3C9 is 6.5 times more active than wild type, but this difference decreases with increasing temperature. At 60 °C, P3C9 is only ∼3.4 times more active.Table IITemperature dependence of kcat and KM for SSII, P3C9, and S41k catK Mk cat/K Ms −1mm×10 5 m −1 s −110 °C Wild-type SSII15.70.280.6 P3C91040.195.5 S4123.30.280.830 °C Wild-type SSII90.00.342.6 P3C92580.2510.3 S4163.80.272.460 °C Wild-type SSII2580.594.4 P3C95790.5310.9 S412640.902.9Kinetic parameters for wild-type SSII, recombined variant P3C9, and wild-type subtilisin S41 were measured on the peptide substrate AAPF at 10, 30, and 60 °C.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters for wild-type SSII, recombined variant P3C9, and wild-type subtilisin S41 were measured on the peptide substrate AAPF at 10, 30, and 60 °C. Conditions were 10 mmCaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPPS, pH 8.5. Standard deviations do not exceed 10%. Mutants of SSII were screened solely for improvements in activity at low temperature. This was meant to simulate, in an approximate way, the presumed evolutionary pressure experienced by enzymes in natural psychrophilic organisms. The final product of the laboratory evolution, variant P3C9, had a k cat 6.6 times greater and ak cat/K M 9.6 times greater than wild type at 10 °C. Furthermore, at 10 °C bothk cat andk cat/K M are larger than those of the natural psychrophilic homolog S41. Only four amino acid substitutions brought about this increase in cold activity, showing that SSII can rapidly adapt to low temperatures when strong selective pressure is applied. Particularly striking is the potential of single point mutations to give large increases in low temperature activity. Recent studies of natural psychrophiles have suggested that, despite the many differences observed between mesophilic and psychrophilic enzymes, single amino acid substitutions may be capable of conferring most psychrophilic characteristics (31Somero G.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 43-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 32Feller G. Gerday C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In this case, a cold-active SSII can be generated by a single point mutation; thek cat of the first generation mutant P2G8 is 3.9 times that of wild type and 2.6 times that of the natural psychrophile S41. Comparison of wild-type and mutant activities at a single temperature is complicated by possible changes in substrate specificity during laboratory evolution on the nonnatural substrate AAPF. Also, the most distinctive feature of psychrophilic enzymes is not simply that they are more active than mesophiles but that they are specifically more active at low temperatures. Thus, of greater interest than the absolute value of the activity is the dependence of activity on temperature. The relative superiority of the activity of P3C9 over that of wild type is greatest at 10 °C and decreases with increasing temperature (TableII and Fig. 5). The effect of temperature on biological rate constants is often expressed in terms of the increase ink cat that comes with raising the temperature 10 °C (“Q 10”). Q 10for wild-type SSII in the 10–30 °C range is ∼2.8, which is typical for mesophilic enzymes (32Feller G. Gerday C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). P3C9, in contrast, has aQ 10 of ∼1.2, similar to theQ 10 of ∼1.3 found for S41. Low values ofQ 10 are a common feature of cold-adapted enzymes (33Low P.S. Bada J.L. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has often been noted that naturally psychrophilic enzymes maintain catalytic rates at low temperatures that are comparable to those of mesophilic enzymes at moderate temperatures. This has been achieved in P3C9, whose k cat of 104 s−1 at 10 °C is close to thek cat of 90 s−1 at 30 °C for wild type. Based on these criteria, we may assert that, with P3C9, we have evolved a truly psychrophilic enzyme. In common with natural psychrophilic enzymes, P3C9 is less thermostable than its mesophilic counterpart, wild-type SSII. Because P3C9 was evolved in the laboratory, we have access to all of the intermediate species generated during the course of evolution from mesophile to psychrophile. This allows us to examine the process by which the final combination of low temperature activity and high temperature stability was reached. From the half-lives reported in Table I we see that there is not a strict inverse relation between stability and low temperature activity. Although two of the first generation mutants were less stable than wild type, the variant P7E1, which shows a nearly 2-fold increase in k cat/K M at 10 °C, is actually more stable. This is consistent with the results of previous directed evolution of the psychrophilic subtilisin S41, in which stability (t 12) was increased ∼500-fold with no loss of low temperature activity (5Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The recombinant of all three SSII mutants, variant P3C9, is less stable than any of the first generation variants. We propose that these data are best explained by random drift rather than an intrinsic trade off between stability and low temperature activity. Because most mutations are destabilizing (34Giver L. Gershenson A. Freskgard P.O. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12809-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), the accumulation of multiple mutations, cold-activating or otherwise, will eventually destabilize an enzyme in the absence of selective pressure to maintain stability. Even without such selective pressure, a stabilizing mutation may occasionally be discovered, as in variant P7E1. However, such events will be uncommon, and stability will ultimately decrease due to the accumulation of multiple destabilizing mutations. Another possible explanation for the generally low stability of psychrophilic enzymes is negative selection. This explanation asserts that highly stable enzymes will be resistant to turnover by normal cellular degradation mechanisms and may therefore accumulate and ultimately be harmful to the organism (31Somero G.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 43-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 32Feller G. Gerday C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 35Benner S.A. Chem. Rev. 1989; 89: 789-806Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is unlikely to be the case with subtilisins, since they are naturally extracellular proteases. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of negative selection toward stability in cold-adapted enzymes, our results demonstrate that it is not necessary to invoke negative selection to explain low stability. We note that, in the discussion above, “stability” does not refer to the thermodynamic stability of the folded state (i.e.ΔG unfold). Subtilisins unfold irreversibly, and thermodynamic parameters are thus not available. We have used instead the half-time of inactivation at high temperature, an effective measure of stability that is widely used in studies of subtilisins (7Taguchi S. Ozaki A. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Momose H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,12Davail S. Feller G. Narinx E. Gerday C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the specific case of subtilisin BPN′, it has been shown that the resistance to inactivation correlates with thermodynamic stability over a wide range of conditions (21Pantoliano M.W. Whitlow M. Wood J.F. Rollence M.L. Finzel B.C. Gilliland G.L. Poulos T.L. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have appeared in which random mutagenesis and screening/selection were used to increase the activity of enzymes at temperatures below the natural physiological temperature. Two of these involved increasing the activity of hyperthermophilic enzymes at mesophilic temperatures (8. 9), whereas one increased the activity of a mesophilic subtilisin (BPN′) at 10 °C (7Taguchi S. Ozaki A. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Momose H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taguchi et al.(7Taguchi S. Ozaki A. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Momose H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) increased the low temperature (10 °C) activity of BPN′ by 70% using a mutagenesis/screening system. The activity increase was primarily due to an increased k cat. Their improved triple mutant showed no loss of stability relative to wild type BPN′. None of the sites mutated in the cold-active BPN′ match sites found in this study. Because the naturally psychrophilic S41 shares such high sequence identity with SSII, one clear route to cold adaptation would be to acquire cold-activating mutations present in S41. However, none of the mutations present in P3C9 are found in S41. Furthermore, except for Thr-253 → Ala, the mutations occurred at sites that are conserved between S41 and SSII. This result can be rationalized on several grounds. The space of all possible sequences for a 310-amino acid protein is vast, and there are likely to be multiple routes to cold adaptation. Additionally, the selective pressures applied during this work were undoubtedly different than those encountered by subtilisin in nature. For example, the synthetic peptide AAPF is not the natural substrate for either SSII or S41. Furthermore, our selection criteria were very stringent; only variants showing improvements of ∼20% or greater were allowed to proceed to the next generation. In natural evolution, much smaller improvements could become fixed in the evolving population. The three-dimensional structure of SSII is not known. However, we have constructed a model based on the homology of SSII with subtilisins of known structure (Fig. 6). The cold-activating mutations are distributed throughout the structure. There are substitutions at both the surface and buried positions and both close to and far from the active site. There is no mutation in or near the putative weak calcium-binding site, which is consistent with the observation that P3C9 has not lost its affinity for calcium. In the absence of actual crystallographic or NMR data, we cannot identify the specific mechanisms responsible for the observed increase in low temperature activity. However, we can offer some tentative explanations. Thr-253 is located in a region that has high identity with subtilisin E (Fig. 1). The corresponding residue in subtilisin E, Thr-224, forms a hydrogen bond with Thr-220 (Thr-249 in SSII) adjacent to the catalytic serine. Disruption of this hydrogen bond by the replacement of threonine with a nonpolar residue such as alanine could lead to structural rearrangements or increased mobility in the active site. Such a disruption may be responsible for the large increase in low temperature activity. The Ser-110 → Phe substitution occurs near the entrance to the active site and replaces a polar amino acid with a nonpolar one. Residue 110 in SSII is equivalent to residue 101 in subtilisin BPN′ (Fig. 1), which is located in the S3 region of the binding pocket and is thought to interact with the P3 side chain of substrate molecules (36Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Since Ser-110 → Phe occurs in the only mutant with a lower K M (P7C10), it is possible that this mutation improves substrate binding through hydrophobic interactions with the highly nonpolar substrate. Asp-98 → Asn, the other mutation present in P7C10, is located on the opposite side of the protein from the active site. This mutation may be neutral or it may contribute to the observed improvement in the activity of P7C10. From the model, no explanation for an effect on activity can be offered. Lys-11 → Arg is one of two mutations found in P7E1, and the only one of these that is retained in P3C9. Based on the approximately additive increase in k cat that results from the recombination of Lys-11 → Arg with Thr-253 → Ala, it appears that Lys-11 → Arg is largely responsible for thek cat increase seen in P7E1. It is not clear, however, how the Lys-11 → Arg mutation acts to achieve this increase. A recent study of temperature adaptation in lactate dehydrogenase A4 (37Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) found that the cold-adapted enzymes possessed both higher k cat and K M values than their mesophilic homologs. This observation was rationalized in terms of localized increases in conformational flexibility; mutations that reduce the energetic barriers between different active site conformations (thus allowing for more rapid interconversion between them) will lead to higher values of k cat. These same mutations, however, will allow the protein to more easily populate conformations that bind the substrate poorly, leading to increases inK M. There is some support for this hypothesis in the present study. The two k cat mutants in the first generation, P7E1 and P2G8, both show increases inK M, and the mutant with the larger increase ink cat also shows a larger increase inK M (Table I). Furthermore, as mentioned above, mutation Thr-253 → Ala likely increases mobility in the active site. The results of recombination with mutant P7C10, however, demonstrate that deleterious effects on K M values can be reversed by additional mutations. The increased stability of P7E1, despite its increases in both k cat andK M, suggests that such localized increases in conformational mobility need not be accompanied by decreases in global stability. In this our study agrees with the work on lactate dehydrogenase A4, in which no correlation between adaptation temperature and stability at 50 °C was seen (37Fields P.A. Somero G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Professor Alan Porter (National University of Singapore) for providing the gene for wild-type SSII.

The middle portion of APC contains three successive 15-amino acid (15-aa) repeats followed by seven related but distinct 20-aa repeats, both of which are able to bind independently to β-catenin (2Rubinfeld B.

In FAP and colorectal cancers, most patients carry APC mutations, which result in the expression of truncated proteins (1Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys.

Colorectal cancer cells with mutant APC contain a large amount of monomeric β-catenin (6Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This activity of APC is localized to the central region of the protein, and the region containing 20-aa repeats are necessary for the degradation of β-catenin (1Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the role of APC in the down-regulation of β-catenin is not clear. β-Catenin was originally identified as a binding protein of cadherin (8Kemler R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In addition to having roles in cell-cell adhesion, β-catenin is a component of the Wnt signaling pathway (9Cadigan K.M. Nusse R.

The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for developmental decisions, regulating anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral patterns in both vertebrates and flies. In vertebrates, the Wnt signaling pathway consists of an intracellular cascade that includes frizzled, Dvl, GSK-3β, β-catenin, and Lef/Tcf. In the absence of Wnt, protein kinase GSK-3β is active and antagonizes downstream elements of the Wnt signaling pathway through changes in the level of cytoplasmic β-catenin (12Pierce S.B.

The mechanism by which the stability of β-catenin is regulated has been largely clarified. Discovery and functional analyses of Axin have provided new clues as to how the stability of β-catenin is regulated (20Kikuchi A. Cell.

Axin was originally identified as a product of the mouseFused locus (22Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F.

Phosphorylated β-catenin forms a complex with βTrCP/FWD1, a member of the F-box protein family, resulting in the degradation of β-catenin by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (33Aberle H. Bauer A.

Indeed, Axin inhibits Wnt-dependent β-catenin accumulation and Tcf activation (29Sakanaka C. Weiss J.B. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, the RGS domains of Axin and conductin interact directly with the region containing the third to seventh 20-aa repeats of APC (27Behrens J. Jerchow B.-A. Würtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C.

In this region, it is likely that a SAMP (Ser-Ala-Met-Pro) sequence is important, since mutation of SAMP to AALP (Ala-Ala-Leu-Pro) in APC abolishes its binding to conductin (27Behrens J.

APC is truncated at amino acids 1337 and 1427 in SW480 and DLD-1 cells, respectively, which are derived from human colon cancers. The APC mutants in these cells do not bind to Axin (28Kishida S.

These results suggest that the interaction of APC with Axin is important for regulating the stability of β-catenin. However, the roles of the complex formation of APC and Axin in the degradation of β-catenin have not been demonstrated. Here we show that APC promotes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin by interacting with Axin, thereby down-regulating β-catenin.

COS and L cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and fetal calf serum (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.), respectively, at 37 °C. SW480 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. L cells stably expressing various deletion mutants of Myc-rAxin were obtained as described (36Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When the accumulation of β-catenin in response to Wnt-3a was examined in L cells, confluent cells (in 35-mm diameter dishes) were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium twice and 0.2 ml of Wnt-3a-conditioned medium which was adjusted to a total volume of 1 ml with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to the cells. After stimulation for 2 h, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (40Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 588-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the lysates (20 μl) were probed with the anti-β-catenin antibody. To detect the ubiquitination of β-catenin, COS, L, and SW480 cells were treated with 25 μm ALLN or 10 μm lactacystin for 8 h. The lysates (5–500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-β-catenin antibody and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-β-catenin antibody. Where specified, the cells transfected with pCGN/ubiquitin to express HA-ubiquitin were treated with 25 μm ALLN or 10 μm lactacystin for 8 h, then the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-β-catenin antibody and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-HA antibody. To determine whether various deletion mutants of Myc-rAxin or Flag-rAxin interact with Myc-APC-(1211–2075), GSK-3β, and β-catenin in intact cells, COS cells (in 60-mm diameter dishes) transfected with pBJ-Myc- and pcDNA3-derived plasmids were lysed as described (40Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 588-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lysates (200 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, then the precipitates were probed with the anti-Myc, anti-GSK-3β, anti-Flag, and anti-β-catenin antibodies. To examine the interaction of Axin with GSK-3β and β-catenin using the purified proteins in vitro, 0.3 μm MBP-rAxin and its deletion mutants were incubated with GST-GSK-3β or GST-β-catenin (10 pmol) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B in 50 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS) for 1 h at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were precipitated by centrifugation, then the precipitates were probed with the anti-MBP antibody. To examine the interaction of GSK-3β with APC-(1211–2075) or Axin using the purified proteins in vitro, 1 μm GST-APC-(1211–2075) or GST-rAxin-(298–832) was incubated with MBP-GSK-3β or MBP (10 pmol) immobilized on amylose resin in 50 μl of reaction mixture for 1 h at 4 °C. MBP-GSK-3β and MBP were precipitated by centrifugation, then the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. One hundred and fifty nm GST-GSK-3β was incubated with 1.4 μm His6-β-catenin in the presence of given concentrations of APC and Axin mutants in 30 μl of a kinase reaction mixture (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1,000–3,000 cpm/pmol)) for 30 min at 30 °C. After the incubation, the mixture was further incubated with cobalt beads for 1 h at 4 °C, then His6-β-catenin was precipitated by centrifugation. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography, and then the radioactivity of the phosphorylated β-catenin was measured. SW480 cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed with PBS three times, and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 12 h. The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with the anti-Myc and the anti-β-catenin antibodies. After being washed with PBS, they were further incubated for 1 h with Alexa 594-labeled anti-mouse and Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. The nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole. The coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted on glass slides, and viewed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS-NTTM, Leica-laser-technik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Luciferase assay was performed as described (36Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway degrades β-catenin and that the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β is required for its ubiquitination (33Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar, 34Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Since β-catenin is accumulated in SW480 cells, human colon cancer cell lines where the C-terminal half of APC is truncated, we first examined whether the ubiquitination of β-catenin occurs in the cells. On treatment with proteasome inhibitors such as ALLN or lactacystin, cells exhibit slowly migrating forms of β-catenin and the accumulation of the protein (33Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, treatment of COS and L cells with ALLN or lactacystin, respectively, resulted in the appearance of slowly migrating forms of β-catenin and the accumulation of the protein (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1-4). When β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from COS cells expressing HA-ubiquitin and treated with ALLN, HA-positive high molecular weight proteins were detected in the β-catenin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and2). Thus, β-catenin is polyubiquitinated in COS and L cells. However, SW480 cells exhibited neither slowly migrated forms of β-catenin nor HA-positive high molecular weight proteins when treated with ALLN or lactacystin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–7, and 1 B, lanes 3–5). Ubiquitination of various proteins in SW480 cells was observed when the cells expressing HA-ubiquitin were treated with lactacystin (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that β-catenin is not ubiquitinated in SW480 cells although as other proteins. Since the ubiquitination of β-catenin requires its phosphorylation by GSK-3β (33Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar, 34Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I. Kikuchi A. Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), we speculated that APC plays an important role in the phosphorylation of β-catenin and that the truncated form of APC loses its activity.

https://openalex.org/W1976389026,"LIM proteins contain one or more double zinc finger structures (LIM domains) mediating specific contacts between proteins that participate in the formation of multiprotein complexes. We report that the LIM-only protein DRAL/FHL2, with four and a half LIM domains, can associate with α3A, α3B, α7A, and several β integrin subunits as shown in yeast two-hybrid assays as well as after overexpression in human cells. The amino acid sequence immediately following the conserved membrane-proximal region in the integrin α subunits or the C-terminal region with the conserved NXXY motif of the integrin β subunits are critical for binding DRAL/FHL2. Furthermore, the DRAL/FHL2 associates with itself and with other molecules that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α subunits. Deletion analysis of DRAL/FHL2 revealed that particular LIM domains or LIM domain combinations bind the different proteins. These results, together with the fact that full-length DRAL/FHL2 is found in cell adhesion complexes, suggest that it is an adaptor/docking protein involved in integrin signaling pathways.

Upon ligand binding, integrins cluster and many intracellular components, including adaptors, structural proteins, and kinases, are recruited into large multimolecular complexes where actin microfilaments anchor. As integrins do not possess intrinsic enzymatic activity, proteins associated with the complexes activate signaling pathways (1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar, 4Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 5Burridge K.

The cytoplasmic domain of integrin β subunits is assumed to play an active role in transducing the signals, whereas those of the integrin α subunits are thought to be modulators. These different functions are probably mediated by diverse proteins that have been shown to interact, for most of them in vitro, with the cytoplasmic domains of the α or β integrin subunits.

Similarly, several proteins have been shown to bind the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α subunits. Five of them, calreticulin (16Rojiani M.V. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), mammalian suppressor of secretion (Mss4), Bridging Integrator protein-1 (also called box-dependent Myc interaction protein-1 or BIN1), and α integrin-binding proteins 63 (AIBP63) and 80 (AIBP80) (17Wixler V.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) interact with several integrin α subunits and bind to the conserved sequence proximal to the transmembrane domain. Another, the calcium- and integrin-binding protein, has a more restricted binding pattern (18Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). With the exception of calreticulin, which has been shown to modulate cell adhesion, the biological significance of these interactions is still unknown. Such proteins are likely involved in the control of multiprotein complex remodeling. The α3β1 integrin transdominantly regulates the clustering of other integrins, including α6β1 (19Dogic D. Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 793-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dogic D. Hülsmann H. Sherman N. Fox J.W. Broermann R. Paulsson M. Aumailley M.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1167-1176PubMed Google Scholar) and of intracellular proteins associated with adhesion complexes. To identify proteins involved in the transdominant control exerted by the α3β1 integrin, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the cytoplasmic domain of the α3A integrin subunit. Of five proteins identified in the screen, four bind the cytoplasmic domain conserved from several integrin α subunits, whereas the fifth protein interacted with the unique, more distal sequence of the integrin α3Acytoplasmic domain (17Wixler V. Laplantine E. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. Petersohn D. Eckes B. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This fifth protein is the four and a half LIM protein 2 (FHL2) of the LIM-only family, which was originally identified as DRAL (for down-regulated in rhabdomyosarcoma LIM protein) by subtractive cloning (23Genini M. Schwalbe P. Scholl F.A. Remppis A. Mattei M.G. Schäfer B.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To follow the recommended nomenclature (HUGO/GDB Nomenclature Committee) and to acknowledge the original discovery, we will refer to the protein as DRAL/FHL2. LIM domains are double zinc finger motifs, defining the expanding family of LIM proteins involved in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (24Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 315-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 25Beckerle M. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Dawid I.B.

They are composed of either exclusively of LIM domains, the LIM-only proteins, or of LIM domains associated with homeodomains, kinase domains, or other functionally active sites, the LIM-plus proteins. Of the latter several proteins such as paxillin, zyxin, CRP1, abLIM, and the paxillin analog in platelets (Hic-5) are associated with the cytoskeleton (25Beckerle M. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 27Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 28Pomies P.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). DRAL/FHL2 is one of five known LIM-only proteins with four and a half LIM domains (33Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Res.

We report here that DRAL/FHL2 and specific subdomains thereof have the capacity to interact with several β integrin subunits, a restricted number of integrin α subunits, and with integrin-binding proteins. Further DRAL/FHL2 can localize to cell adhesion complexes. cDNA fragments encoding the complete cytoplasmic domain of integrin α2, α3A, α5, α6A, and β1A subunits were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR1 using as template total RNA from the human mammary epithelial cell line HBL100. They were inserted into EcoRI/BamHI sites of the pAS2-1 vector (CLONTECH. Heidelberg, Germany) as fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA binding domain as described previously (17Wixler V. Laplantine E. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. Petersohn D. Eckes B. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments containing the partial or complete cytoplasmic domains of the integrin α3B, α6B, α7A, α7B, β1D, β2, and β3A subunits were amplified by PCR using the full-length cDNA as a template and appropriate specific sense and antisense primers containing restriction site tags. The constructs for the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α1 and β6 subunits were provided by Drs. B. Eckes and D. Petersohn (Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, Germany) and Dr. S. Spong (Lung Biology Center, University of California, San Francisco), respectively. All integrin α3A and β1A deletion mutants were derived by PCR amplification using the appropriate cDNA constructs and inserted into the pAS2-1 vector as above. DRAL/FHL2, AIBP63, AIBP80, Mss4, and BIN1 were available from our previous study (17Wixler V. Laplantine E. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. Petersohn D. Eckes B. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as clones in the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). Deletion mutants of DRAL/FHL2 generated by PCR were cloned intoBamHI/XhoI sites of the pACT2 vector. AIBP80 and DRAL/FHL2 were subcloned and inserted intoEcoRI/BamHI sites of the pAS2-1 vector. For expression in mammalian cells, the cytoplasmic domains of integrin α2 (aa 1126–1152), α3A (aa 1015–1051), α7A (aa 1060–1115), and β1A (aa 752–798) subunits were cut from the pAS2-1 construct using NdeI andSpeI and, after fill-in of the NdeI overhang, the inserts were cloned in-frame into the GST-vector pEBG (a gift of Dr. A. Kalmes, University of Würzburg, Germany), which had been cut and filled in at the BamHI site and then digested withSpeI. The full-length human DRAL/FHL2 was cut from pACT2 construct by NheI/AvrII and inserted into theSpeI site of the pEBG vector. For the generation of Myc-tagged full-length or truncated DRAL/FHL2 and AIBP80, the cDNAs encoding these proteins were cut from pACT2 constructs (17Wixler V. Laplantine E. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. Petersohn D. Eckes B. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) bySalI/XhoI and XbaI/XhoI, respectively, and cloned in-frame into the pCS2+MT vector (a gift of Dr. A. Kalmes). Full-length or truncated DRAL/FHL2 was inserted into the XhoI site, and AIBP80 was inserted after filling in of the existing overhangs into the StuI site. Full-length cDNA coding for the entire integrin α3A subunit in the Bluescript vector (a generous gift of Dr. M. E. Hemler, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) was cut by XbaI and subcloned into the XbaI site of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Yeast cultures were grown under standard conditions in liquid or on solid media using YPD or minimal SD media. The yeast strain Y190 (CLONTECH) was transformed sequentially with the pAS2-1 plasmid coding for the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α3A subunit as bait and then with a pACT2 plasmid containing the placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH). Transformants were grown on SD medium lacking the amino acids leucine, tryptophan, and histidine in the presence of 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. On day 5 the colonies were tested for the activity of the lacZ reporter gene in a β-galactosidase filter assay. To remove the bait cDNA, positive clones were recultured on SD medium without tryptophan in the presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. The cycloheximide-resistant Y190 yeast clones were verified in a mating assay with yeast strain Y187 expressing the pAS2-1 plasmid with either the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α3A subunit, the unrelated protein lamin C (CLONTECH), or the nonfused GAL4 DNA binding domain as baits. Clones were scored as positive when the His+ and LacZ+ phenotype of yeast cells was dependent on the co-expression of only the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α3A subunit as bait. Such clones were retested in a co-transformation assay with purified plasmid cDNA using the same controls as in mating assays. For direct two-hybrid binding assays, yeast Y190 cells were co-transfected with DRAL/FHL2 or its deletion mutants fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain in the pACT2 vector and with one of the cDNA constructs coding for either integrin cytoplasmic domains, mutants thereof, or DRAL/FHL2 itself, fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain in the pAS2-1 vector. In other experiments, yeast cells were co-transfected with DRAL/FHL2 in pAS2-1 and with AIBP63, AIBP80, Mss4, BIN1, or DRAL/FHL2 itself in pACT2. In all cases, positive clones were scored as described above. For transient expression, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (American Type Culture Collection) or mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. U. Rapp, University of Wurzburg) were grown for 24 h in 6-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/35 mm-diameter well) prior to transfection with plasmid DNA (2 μg/well) using Superfect Transfection mixture (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When cells were co-transfected with different DNAs, the DNA content was equalized with appropriate amounts of empty expression vectors. For stable expression, HEK293 cells were transfected with the pTracer-CMV vector (Invitrogen) containing the full-length DRAL/FHL2 cDNA with an N-terminal insertion of the nine amino acid hemagglutinin tag (HA tag). The cells were trypsinized 48 h after transfection and selected further in medium containing 25 μg/ml zeocin. After 2 weeks, single colonies were picked, cells were cultured, and the expression of HA-tagged DRAL/FHL2 was analyzed by immunoblotting using HA tag-specific monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (a generous gift from Dr. U. Rapp, University of Würzburg, Germany). Normal human skin fibroblasts and the epithelial cell line HaCat were provided by Dr. H. Smola (Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, Germany). Established lines of human lung fibroblasts (Wi26), embryonic kidney (293), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), mammary epithelia (HBL100), mammary epithelial carcinoma (MCF-7), epidermoid carcinoma (A431), and ductal mammary carcinoma (T47D) have been previously described (36Sonnenberg A.

CaCo2 cells were newly purchased from the ATCC. Rat PC12 and mouse NIH 3T3 cells were provided by Dr. U. Rapp (University of Wurzburg) and human RD-9 cells by Dr. A. Hoffmann (Department of Biochemistry, University of Cologne). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, a mixture of antibiotics, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Seromed/Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Cells were fractionated as described previously (39Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and scraped in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmpepstatin, pH 7.2). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were homogenized with a tight-fitting pestle and loaded onto 1 ml of 1m sucrose in lysis buffer. The nuclear fraction was collected by centrifugation (1,600 × g, 10 min). The pellet was washed once with 1 m sucrose in lysis buffer. The supernatant was further centrifuged (150,000 × g, 30 min), and the resulting pellet and supernatant was taken as membrane and cytosolic fraction, respectively. Cytosolic proteins were precipitated by the methanol/chloroform method (40Wessel D. Flügge U. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3203) Google Scholar). Pellets of all three fractions were dissolved in 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer, and 30 μl were used for SDS-PAGE analysis. Transiently transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Brij 98, or 1% Triton X-100, 2% glycerol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm pepstatin at room temperature for 20 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min) at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with antibodies against the Myc tag (clone 9E10, Oncogene distributed by Calbiochem, Schwalbach, Germany) and protein G-conjugated agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) when precipitating GST-tagged proteins. The complexes were washed three time with lysis buffer, suspended in electrophoresis sample buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 3 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected with goat polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α3A subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or against GST (Life Technologies, Inc.), mouse monoclonal antibodies against Myc (clone 9E10), or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant GST-DRAL/FHL2 fusion protein and partially purified by affinity chromatography on a GST column (a generous gift of Dr. B. Schäfer, University of Zurich, Switzerland), followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were cultured either overnight on uncoated or for 60 min on fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml) glass coverslips in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min, and blocked with 1% BSA (fraction V, Sigma). The cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining with mouse monoclonal antibody F-VII against human vinculin (a gift from Dr. M. Glukhova, Institut Curie, Paris, France), K20 (Immunotech, Marseille, France), or TS2/16 (41Hemler M.E. Sanchez-Madrid F. Flotte T.J. Krensky A.M. Burakoff S.J. Bhan A.K. Springer T.A. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) against the human β1 integrin subunit, 9E10 against the Myc tag, or rabbit polyclonal antiserum against recombinant GST-DRAL/FHL2, followed by Cy3-conjugated second antibodies against mouse or rabbit immunoglobulins (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories distributed by Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) together with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). For analysis of cell footprints the cells were lysed by osmotic shock with or without cross-linking with 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) (Pierce) as described previously (38Sondermann H. Dogic D. Pesch M. Aumailley M. Cell Adh. Commun. 1999; 7: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and were then processed for immunofluorescence labeling as detailed above. After mounting, the samples were observed with an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with epifluorescence optics. To identify proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the α3Aintegrin subunit, a human placenta library (>5 × 106independent clones) was used in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the C-terminal cytoplasmic part of the α3A integrin subunit (aa 1015–1051) as bait (17Wixler V. Laplantine E. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. Petersohn D. Eckes B. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Out of 84 His+- and LacZ+-positive clones (17Wixler V. Laplantine E. Geerts D. Sonnenberg A. Petersohn D. Eckes B. Paulsson M. Aumailley M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), 28 contained cDNAs with an identical open reading frame coding for the 279 amino acid residues of DRAL/FHL2. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed in a direct two-hybrid binding assay (TableI). Transformation of yeast cells with DRAL/FHL2 in pACT2 vector alone or together with the GAL4-DNA binding domain in pAS2-1 vector or together with an unrelated protein, lamin C, fused to the GAL4-DNA binding domain instead of α3A, did not activate the His and lacZ reporter genes (Table I). The predicted amino acid sequence contains four double zinc finger LIM domains at the C-terminal end and a half-LIM domain at the N terminus. It corresponds to FHL2 (23Genini M. Schwalbe P.

To test if DRAL/FHL2 binds the integrin α3A subunit also in mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the GST-tagged α3A cytoplasmic domain (aa 1015–1051) and with Myc-tagged DRAL/FHL2. These were tested for complex formation in co-precipitation experiments. The GST-tagged integrin α3Acytoplasmic domain precipitated in immune complexes formed in the presence of antibodies against the Myc tag as shown by immunoblotting with specific antibodies (Fig.1 A). Reciprocally, the presence of Myc-tagged DRAL/FHL2 in complexes specifically precipitated with antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of the α3Aintegrin subunit was dependent on the expression of GST-tagged α3A cytoplasmic domain but not on the expression of GST alone (Fig. 1 A). Thus, consistent with the two-hybrid data, the LIM-only protein DRAL/FHL2 specifically interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α3A subunit in mammalian cells.Table ISpecific interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α3A subunit with DRAL/FHL2 in a yeast two-hybrid binding assayBaitPreyReporter geneHis expressionlacZ activitypAS2-1/α3ApACT2/DRAL/FHL2++++pAS2-1/α3ApACT2−−pAS2-1pACT2/DRAL/FHL2−−pAS2-1/lamin CpACT2/DRAL/FHL2−−Yeast Y190 cells were co-transformed with the indicated combinations of bait and prey.

A, association of DRAL/FHL2 with the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α3A subunit. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with different GST- and Myc-tagged constructs as indicated. After 48 h, cell lysates were divided into two parts. From 1 aliquot, proteins were precipitated with the antibody 9E10 against the Myc tag followed by protein G-conjugated agarose for precipitation of Myc-tagged proteins. With the other aliquot, proteins were precipitated with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads for GST-tagged proteins. After SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α3A subunit was only detected in precipitates from cells where the integrin peptide had been co-expressed with Myc-tagged DRAL/FHL2 (left blot, lane 4). In the reverse experiment (glutathione-precipitated complexes), Myc-tagged DRAL/FHL2 was detected only when co-expressed with GST-tagged α3A peptide (right blot, lane 4) but not with GST alone. After the first immunodetection, the blots were stripped and redeveloped with polyclonal antibody against recombinant DRAL/FHL2 (bottom, left blot) or against GST (bottom, right blot) to ascertain that Myc-tagged DRAL/FHL2 and GST-tagged α3A peptide were equivalently precipitated.

We demonstrated that β-catenin, recently known as a potent oncogene, and CBP/p300 are associated through its CH3 region, which is a primary target of adenoviral oncoprotein E1A and various nuclear proteins, such as p53, cyclin E, and AP-1, and both are colocalized in the nuclear bodies. CBP/p300 potentiated Lef-mediated transactivation of β-catenin, and E1A, a potent inhibitor of CBP/p300, repressed its transactivation. Furthermore, overexpression of stable β-catenin mutant competitively suppressed the p53-dependent pathway.

In addition, CBP/p300 has been proposed as a bridging protein, bringing together proteins of the RNA polymerase II-dependent basal transcription complex with either specific transcription factors or other cofactors. Drosophila Armadillo and its vertebrate homologue β-catenin are scaffold proteins in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, and they function as signal transducers to the nucleus in Wnt/Wingless pathway (15Nusse R.

The involvement of β-catenin in its nuclear functions, including transcriptional activation and oncogenic events, addresses the existence of bridging nuclear factors for recruitment of RNA polymerase II. To test this hypothesis, in the present study, we explored the possible association of β-catenin with CBP/p300 and attempted to define the biological function of CBP/p300 and β-catenin interaction. HeLa cells, L cells, and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy 5A supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method. Thirty ng of a RSV-Renillaluciferase control plasmid were included in each transfection experiment to control for the efficiency of transfection. To ensure equal DNA amounts, empty plasmids were added in each transfection. The luciferase activity was measured with AutoLumat (Berthold). The values were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity as an internal control. Anti-β-catenin (8A5) and anti-CBP (5614) antibodies were obtained according to the procedures described previously (22Nagafuchi A. Ishihara S. Tsukita S. J.

A series of CBP deletion mutants, pRc/RSV-mCBP-HA and pG5b-Luc, have been described previously (24Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem.

Shinoura N. Hamada H. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2503-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGAL4 control vector was generated by inserting the GAL4 DNA binding domain (aa 1–147) of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pGAL4-p53(1–83) was generated by PCR1-based subcloning into pGAL4. pcEF9-mCBP was generated by inserting full-length mouse CBP into pcEF9. β-Catenin deletion mutants were made by digesting a full-length β-catenin with appropriate enzymes or PCR-based subcloning into pcDNA3-HA. GST-CBP-(1679–1891) and biotinylated tag fused CBP-(1679–1891) were generated by insertingEcoRI-SmaI fragment (aa 1679–1891) into pGEX5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and PinPoint Xa1 (Promega), respectively. GST-β-catenin or GST-β-catenin-(550–781) was made by inserting a full-length β-catenin or a fragment (aa 550–781) generated by PCR into pGEX5X-1. HA-PML expression and Lef-1 expression plasmids were made by reverse transcription-PCR-based cloning into pcDNA3-HA. HA-tagged stable β-catenin mutant (pEFBCHA) was generated by inserting C-terminal HA-tagged full-length β-catenin mutant (S33A, S37A, T41A, S45A) downstream of EF-1α promoter. HdNB was made by inserting N-terminal truncated β-catenin (ΔN89) in frame to N-terminal HA-tag. FLAG-tagged stable β-catenin mutant (pEFFlagMMB) was generated by inserting N-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length β-catenin mutant (S33A, S37A, T41A, S45A) downstream of EF-1α promoter. p300 and p300ΔCH3 expression plasmids and wild type and mutants E1A were described previously (23Nakajima T.

HeLa cells were plated onto glass coverslips and transfected using Fugene-6 reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 60% confluence. Thirty-six h after transfection, cells were treated with 200 ng/ml doxorubicin (Sigma) and incubated additional 12–16 h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 30 min, cells were incubated with rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution; 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution; pAb421 oncogene science), followed by staining with Cy5-conjugated anti-rat and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution each; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TUNEL staining was performed by an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara). Immunofluorescence was analyzed under a confocal microscopy. HEK293T cells were transfected using lipofectAMINE reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.), and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Approximately 200 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) coupled with protein A/G-agarose in buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C overnight, and washed five times with the same buffer. For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous β-catenin with CBP, cells were lysed in Co-IP buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CBP antibody (5614). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates was done as described previously (24Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assay was performed as described previously (24Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For in vitro competitive binding assay, in vitro translated 35S-labeled p53 was incubated with 2 μg of biotinylated tag-fused CBP (1679–1860) or control biotinylated tag bound to streptavidin beads in buffer A containing 250 μg/ml of GST, GST-β-catenin-(550–781), or GST-β-catenin-(661–781) for 3 h. After washing five times with buffer A, the pull-down complexes were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were analyzed by an image analyzer (BAS2000; Fujix). We first performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using an HA-tagged stable β-catenin mutant. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the HA-tagged β-catenin expression plasmid or a mock plasmid. Western blotting of HA-β-catenin complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody revealed that endogenous CBP/p300 was coimmunoprecipitated with HA-β-catenin (Fig. 1 A). Bacterially expressed GST-β-catenin also captured in vitrotranslated CBP and p300 with comparable binding to in vitrotranslated Lef-1 (Fig. 1 B). To evaluate the interaction between β-catenin and CBP/p300 under more physiological conditions, we analyzed endogenous β-catenin and CBP/p300 in colon carcinoma cell line, HCT116 cells, in which β-catenin is mutated and thereby stabilized. As shown in Fig. 1 D, endogenous β-catenin could be efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous CBP/p300. Further analysis using in vitro translated CBP fragments (Fig. 1 A) revealed that β-catenin specifically interacted with the CH3 region of CBP (Fig. 1 E), which is known as a binding site of various nuclear proteins concerning cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, such as E1A, cyclin E/CDK2, p53, and AP-1. To define the CBP interaction domain for β-catenin binding, we constructed a series of β-catenin deletion mutants (Fig.1 A). GST-pull-down assay using GST-fused CBP CH3 fragment (aa 1679–1891) indicated that CBP interacted with both of the N- and C-terminal armadillo (Arm) repeat domains, but not with the N- and C-terminal hydrophilic activation domains (20Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar, 26Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 F). These results indicated that the CH3 region of CBP/p300 interacts with the β-catenin Arm repeat domain in vitro. To further confirm the interaction between CBP/p300 and β-catenin, we examined its cellular localization using mouse fibroblast L cells. Since this cell line does not express E-cadherin (27Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), we predicted that β-catenin is translocated to the nucleus. Overexpression of β-catenin in L cells results in nuclear translocation and formation of speckle-like aggregates (Fig. 2 A,panel a), in which endogenous CBP was also translocated to the same speckles (Fig. 2 A, panels b and c). A similar speckled pattern was observed in HeLa cells, when both CBP and β-catenin were transfected together (Fig. 2 B, panels d–f). In contrast, transfection of either CBP or β-catenin alone showed uniform distribution in the nucleus (Fig. 2 B, panels g and h). These results suggested physical association of CBP/p300 with β-catenin in the nucleus. Recently, a similar speckled-like structure called PML nuclear bodies (NBs) or PODs (PML oncogenic domains) has been found in the nucleus (18Peifer M. Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Its function is not yet fully understood, but it has been shown that a variety of nuclear proteins (PML, Sp100, SUMO-1, etc.) are present. Therefore, we examined whether nuclear aggregates formed by CBP and β-catenin are identical to this nuclear structure. As shown in Fig. 2 C (panels i–k), HA-PML was colocalized in the CBP-β-catenin aggregates, indicating the nuclear aggregates formed by CBP and β-catenin are NBs. To investigate the functional significance of the interaction between CBP/p300 and β-catenin, we examined the effect of p300 on β-catenin-mediated transcription using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing Lef binding sites (pTOPflash) or mutant Lef binding sites (pFOPflash) (19Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of stable β-catenin mutant and Lef-1 in L cells results in significant enhancement of luciferase activity (Fig. 3 A). p300 enhanced this β-catenin-Lef-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner, while a p300ΔCH3, which has the 33-amino acid deletion in the CH3 region, had no effect (Fig.3 B). CBP also had the same synergistic effect as p300 (data not shown). In HCT116 cells, the transcription activity of pTOPFlash reporter was two to three times higher than that of pFOPFlash as a result of stabilization of β-catenin mutant (Fig. 3 C). p300, but not p300ΔCH3, could enhance this β-catenin-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 C). Furthermore, E1A, which binds to CBP/p300 and inhibits CBP/p300-dependent transactivation, repressed the β-catenin-dependent transactivation in HCT116 (Fig.3 D). E1AmCR2 mutant that lacks the ability to interact with retinoblastoma protein but does bind to CBP also inhibited the β-catenin-dependent transactivation. In contrast, E1AΔN, which is defective for CBP/p300 binding, and E1AΔCR1, which is defective for both CBP/p300 and retinoblastoma binding, were impaired in repression (Fig. 3 D). To further verify the CBP/p300 dependence on the β-catenin-mediated transactivation, we utilized GAL4 fusion system using β-catenin-GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion (GAL4-β-catenin) expression plasmid and G5b-Luc reporter containing five GAL4 binding sites and E1b promoter. p300 potentiated GAL4-β-catenin transactivation, whereas p300ΔCH3 had no effect (Fig. 3 E). These results indicated that Lef-directed transactivation by β-catenin is mediated by CBP/p300. The accumulation of stable β-catenin mutant in the nucleus is known to provide the possibility leading to oncogenesis (18Peifer M. Science. 1997; 275: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We next considered that the interaction between β-catenin and CBP might contribute to a certain oncogenic event, such as suppression of apoptosis. In p53-dependent apoptosis, p53 needs for interaction with CBP/p300 through the CH3 region (11Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), which is the same binding region as β-catenin. Furthermore, different transcription factors that associate with CBP/p300 as a cofactor were known to antagonize one another by competing limiting amounts of CBP/p300, as reported for AP-1 and nuclear receptor (14Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

These data prompted us to examine whether β-catenin acts to inhibit p53-dependent pathway by inhibiting the interaction of p53 with CBP. We first examined the competitive effect of β-catenin expression in p53-dependent transactivation using a Gal4-fused p53 activation domain (aa 1–83) expression plasmid and luciferase reporter plasmid containing Gal4 binding sites (G5b-Luc), because it has been reported that CBP/p300 potentiates p53 transactivation through the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (11Avantaggiati M.L.

As shown in Fig.4 A, stable β-catenin mutant inhibited transactivation of p53 activation domain at comparable levels of a dominant-negative CBP CH3 fragment (11Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K.

We next performedin vitro competitive binding assay to address the possibility of direct competition between β-catenin and p53 for association with CBP. As shown in Fig. 4 B, GST-β-catenin (550–781 aa) competed directly with p53 for association with the CH3 fragment of CBP in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a control GST protein and β-catenin mutant, both of which defect the binding of CBP/p300, did not. Finally, we tested whether β-catenin is able to suppress p53-dependnt apoptosis. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a p53 expression plasmid and were subjected to following treatment with 200 ng/ml doxorubicin, which is a DNA damage-inducing agent and known to enhance p53-dependent apoptosis (11Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Approximately 90% of p53-transfected cells were positive for TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP end labeling) staining, and microscopic analysis revealed several particular apoptotic features, such as cell shrinkage and highly nuclear condensation (Fig. 4 C, panels c–e). Coexpression of stable HA-β-catenin mutant significantly suppressed p53-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 4 C, panels f–h, Table I), and immunocytochemical staining with anti-HA antibody revealed that a few cells, which undergo apoptosis, express low or undetectable levels of β-catenin. In contrast, almost all cells expressing high levels of β-catenin appeared to escape apoptosis (Fig. 4 C,panels f–i). Collectively, these results suggested that stable β-catenin mutant suppresses p53-dependent pathway by competitively binding to CBP/p300.Table IEffect of β-catenin on p53-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cellsApoptotic cellsp53p53 + stable β-catenin mutant% Exp. 191.567.8Exp. 285.257.5Exp. 394.879.1Mean90.568.1Apoptotic index represents the percentage of TUNEL positive cells in p53-transfected HeLa cells.

Open table in a new tab Apoptotic index represents the percentage of TUNEL positive cells in p53-transfected HeLa cells. Values were determined by counting more than 200 cells from randomly chosen fields. A recent study has described that Drosophila CBP represses an inappropriate activation of Lef-mediated signal at the low levels of β-catenin (32Waltzer L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Our data from the reporter gene assay revealed that CBP enhanced Lef-mediated transactivation, suggesting the differential modes of action of β-catenin expression between the normal and transformed cells. In the normal cells, as the nuclear levels of wild-type β-catenin are thought to be maintained at a low level by GSK-3β-dependent ubiquitination pathway, CBP/p300 would be preferentially recruited to Lef/TCF, acting to repress the Wingless pathway. On the other hand, in the transformed cells, when β-catenin is mutated, stabilized, and present at high levels in the nucleus, CBP/p300 might be dominantly recruited to β-catenin by the following two mechanisms. (i) Most population of CBP is occupied by β-catenin because of a much higher levels of β-catenin than those of Lef/TCF. (ii) High levels of β-catenin inhibit the binding between Lef and CBP by the association of β-catenin with Lef and/or CBP and cause the conversion from a Lef-CBP suppression complex to a Lef-β-catenin-CBP activation complex. Although the function of PML bodies is not fully understood, several recent studies provide clues to understand PML bodies. For instance, Doucas et al. (33Doucas V. Tini M. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have shown that the overexpression of PML results in the recruitment of CBP to PML bodies, accompanied by a synergistic enhancement of retinoic acid receptor transactivation. Torii et al. (34Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the recruitment of Daxx to PML bodies affects Fas-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, PML has been reported to be essential for irradiation-induced apoptosis (35Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 36Quignon F. De Bels F. Koken M. Feunteun J. Ameisen J.C. de The H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the recruitment of β-catenin and CBP/p300 to PML bodies plays a significant role in the regulation of transcription and apoptosis. A p53-dependent pathway was recently shown to involve apoptosis through CBP/p300, considering the dominant-negative effect of the CH3 fragment (11Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Since the cellular level of CBP/p300 is limiting, different transcription factors associated with CBP/p300 as a cofactor are reported to antagonize one another. For example, the repression of AP-1 activity by nuclear receptors was reported in the earlier study (14Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar), and competitive inhibition between Stat2 and NF-κ(29) and p53 and NF-κ(30) has been described more recently. In view of these results, it is possible that molecules that tightly bind to the CH3 region of CBP/p300 prevent the p53-dependent pathway. However, suppression of the p53-dependent pathway by the CH3-binding molecules would not always occur, because in many cases cells appear to be transformed by a combination of various oncogenic events. In the case of β-catenin, in addition to its ability to inhibit tumor suppresser functions of p53, a certain combinatorial action of other effectors, such as the transcriptional activation of downstream oncogenes (c-Myc or cyclin D), might be required for subsequent oncogenic transformation (28Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 37He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Therefore, the up-regulation of downstream oncogenes by CBP, β-catenin, and Lef and the concomitant suppression of p53-dependent pathway by the competitive mechanism may be key events for oncogenesis by β-catenin.

Type 1 11β-HSD (11β-HSD1) is highly expressed in liver where it regenerates glucocorticoids, thus amplifying their action and contributing to induction of glucocorticoid-responsive genes, most of which are also regulated by members of the C/EBP (CAAT/enhancer-binding protein) family of transcription factors. Here we demonstrate that C/EBPα is a potent activator of the 11β-HSD1 gene in hepatoma cells and that mice deficient in C/EBPα have reduced hepatic 11β-HSD1expression. In contrast, C/EBPβ is a relatively weak activator of 11β-HSD1 transcription in hepatoma cells and attenuates C/EBPα induction, and mice that lack C/EBPβ have increased hepatic 11β-HSD1 mRNA. The 11β-HSD1promoter (between −812 and +76) contains 10 C/EBP binding sites, and mutation of the promoter proximal sites decreases the C/EBP inducibility of the promoter. One site encompasses the transcription start, and both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are present in complexes formed by liver nuclear proteins at this site.

The control of energy metabolism is central to the maintenance of homeostasis, and glucocorticoids play an important role in regulating glucose availability and utilization. In addition, during inflammation or injury, glucocorticoids potently suppress the immune response and play a role in the acute phase response in liver (1Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The actions of glucocorticoids are principally mediated by the type II or glucocorticoid receptor and, in a limited number of tissues, by the related type I or mineralocorticoid receptor. The interaction between glucocorticoid hormone and receptors is crucially modulated by the glucocorticoid-metabolizing 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD; EC1.1.1.146)1 enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 2Chapman K.E. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Jamieson P.M. Williams L.J.S. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 3Seckl J.R. Chapman K.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 11β-HSD interconverts active glucocorticoid hormones (corticosterone, cortisol) and inert 11-keto metabolites (11-dehydrocorticosterone, cortisone), thus controlling intracellular availability of active glucocorticoids. Two isozymes of 11β-HSD have been identified; type 1 (11β-HSD1) and type 2 (11β-HSD2). 11β-HSD2 is a high affinity NAD+-dependent enzyme. It functions exclusively as a dehydrogenase (inactivating glucocorticoids) (4Albiston A.L. Obeyesekere V.R. Smith R.E. Krozowski Z.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R11-R17Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 5Brown R.W. Chapman K.E. Kotelevtsev Y. Yau J.L.W. Lindsay R.S. Brett L. Leckie C. Murad P. Lyons V. Mullins J.J.

Invest. 1999; 103: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In contrast, 11β-HSD1 is a lower affinity, NADP(H)-dependent enzyme, which is widely expressed, with highest levels in liver (9Agarwal A.K. Monder C. Eckstein B. White P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18939-18943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although 11β-HSD1 is bi-directional in cell homogenates, in intact cells, including primary rat hepatocytes, the enzyme is predominantly a reductase, regenerating active glucocorticoids from inactive 11-dehydroglucocorticoids (10Low S.C. Chapman K.E. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Jamieson P.M. Chapman K.E. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the 11β-HSD1 gene cannot reduce 11-keto glucocorticoids to active 11-hydroxy steroids (12Kotelevtsev Y. Holmes M.C. Burchell A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R. Brown R. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Mullins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14924-14929Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Hepatic 11β-HSD1 is the major site of regeneration of active glucocorticoids; in humans, inert cortisone administered orally is rapidly converted to cortisol, predominantly by the liver (13Walker B.R. Campbell J.C. Fraser R. Stewart P.M. Edwards C.R.W. Clin. Endocrinol. 1992; 37: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As well as contributing toward plasma glucocorticoid levels, 11β-HSD1 increases intracellular glucocorticoid levels, amplifying glucocorticoid action. 11β-HSD1-deficient mice show impaired activation of gluconeogenic enzymes upon starvation, resulting in lower blood glucose levels than their wild-type littermates, and resist hyperglycemia provoked by obesity or stress (12Kotelevtsev Y. Holmes M.C. Burchell A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R. Brown R. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Mullins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14924-14929Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In humans, 11β-HSD inhibition leads to increased insulin sensitivity, presumably by attenuating glucocorticoid antagonism of hepatic insulin action (14Walker B.R. Connacher A.A. Lindsay R.M. Webb D.J. Edwards C.R.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3155-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme thus provides a novel control of hepatic glucose/insulin relationships and represents a potential therapeutic target for the manipulation of hepatic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Clearly, the regulation of hepatic 11β-HSD1 expression is of substantial interest. Although the control of 11β-HSD1 expression has been widely studied in vivo and in cell culture (reviewed in Ref. 2Chapman K.E. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Jamieson P.M. Williams L.J.S. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms governing 11β-HSD1 transcription have yet to be determined. The promoter region of the rat 11β-HSD1 gene has been cloned (15Moisan M.-P. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A single major promoter is active in liver and hippocampus, although kidney utilizes two additional promoters (15Moisan M.-P. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The promoter used in liver lacks a TATA box, but has a CCAAT sequence at −73 to −69 (the transcription start site is designated +1) as well as a GCAAT sequence in the inverse orientation between −63 and −67. In this study, we have investigated the transcriptional control of the 11β-HSD1 gene in liver and demonstrate the essential role played by C/EBPα in the regulation of the gene encoding this key glucocorticoid-metabolizing enzyme. A 6.8-kb EcoRI fragment encoding part of the rat 11β-HSD1 gene was subcloned from λA (15Moisan M.-P. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and sequenced using Sequenase II (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Putative transcription factor binding sites were identified using computer software available at the UK Medical Research Council Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center. pr11β1(−1799/+49) has been previously described (16Voice M.W. Seckl J.R. Edwards C.R.W. Chapman K.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and encodes −1799 to +49 (relative to the transcription start) of the rat 11β-HSD1 gene fused to the promoterless luciferase gene of pSV0L (17de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. de Luca M. Helsinki D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

Exonuclease III/mung bean nuclease digestion was used to generate the remaining plasmids fusing 11β-HSD1 5′-flanking DNA and the first 49 bp of exon 1 to luciferase. Mutagenesis reactions were carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and constructs were verified by sequencing. Oligonucleotides used to introduce mutations were mFP2, 5′-CTCCCCCGTCCCTGATGTA A AAATTCAGAGGCTGCTGC-3′ (encoding −19 to +19; mutated nucleotides are underlined; the transcription start is in boldface); mFP1, 5′-GAGGCTGCTGCCTGCCTGGAAGCTTGTAGAAAGAGCTGCAGG-3′ (+9 to +50); mFP3, 5′-GGAGTAAACATTGTCCATTATAGGGCCCATCACGCAGGCTGCC-3′ (−142 to −100); and mFP4, 5′-CTGGAAGTTGCCTCTTACTTGGCAAAATGGAGTAAACATTGTCC-3′ (encoding −170 to −127). pr11β1(−812/−599)-PSVand pr11β1(−599/−88)-PSV were made by subcloning restriction fragments into pGL2-promoter (Promega). pMSV-C/EBPα and pMSV-C/EBPβ were a gift from S.

In some experiments, pMSV was used in control transfections that did not include C/EBP; results for transfections with pMSV were not significantly different to those in which no “empty” vector was used. 48 h after transfection, luciferase activity was assayed in cell lysates as described previously (16Voice M.W.

Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized by OSWEL (Department of Chemistry, University of Southampton, UK) and are shown in TableI. A series of overlapping restriction fragments covering the 11β-HSD1 promoter between −812 and +76 were each labeled at the 5′-end on the lower strand. In most cases the fragment was first subcloned into pGEM-3 (Promega) to generate suitable restriction sites for end labeling.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 4259-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA-2000). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Values are mean ± S.E. To identify putative regulatory sequence elements in the rat 11β-HSD1 gene, we extended the previous limited sequence analysis (15Moisan M.-P. Edwards C.R.W. Seckl J.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and determined the complete sequence of a 6.8-kb EcoRI fragment encoding 5287 nucleotides of 5′-flanking DNA and part of the structural gene, including the first two exons. Several microsatellite sequences are present 5′ of −2500, including a 170-bp polypurine sequence and a 300-bp (NA)n repeat. At −462 there is a (CT)26 repeat, immediately followed by (GT)19 and 65 nucleotides rich in CCTT repeats. Several putative transcription factor binding sites were noted, including sequences corresponding to glucocorticoid response element consensus half sites and putative binding sites for HNF1, HNF3, and the C/EBP family of transcription factors. Because the region 5′ to the 11β-HSD1 gene contains several putative C/EBP binding sites, the involvement of C/EBP in the transcriptional control of the promoter was investigated in HepG2 cells (a human hepatoma cell line) using a series of plasmids fusing 5′-flanking DNA and 49 bp of exon 1 of the rat 11β-HSD1 gene to a luciferasereporter gene. HepG2 cells express low levels of endogenous 11β-HSD1 (data not shown) and have been extensively used to characterize gene regulation by C/EBP. Basal expression of pr11β1(−3618/+49) was low in transfected HepG2 cells, and deletion of 5′-flanking DNA to −812 had no significant effect on luciferase activity (Fig.1 A). Deletion of DNA between −812 and −754 resulted in higher basal activity, which was not significantly altered with further deletion to −88 (Fig.1 A). Co-transfection of C/EBPα with pr11β1(−3618/+49) increased luciferase reporter activity approximately 15- to 20-fold (Fig. 1 A), and deletion of 11β-HSD1 5′-flanking DNA to −579 had no significant effect on the magnitude of the C/EBPα induction (Fig. 1 A). However, deletion of DNA between −579 and −322 reduced C/EBPα induction (approximately 3-fold), with a further reduction on deletion to −124 and elimination with deletion to −88 (Fig. 1 A). These results show that a repressor element lies between −812 and −754 and that several regions of the 11β-HSD1 promoter, particularly between −579 and −88, contribute to C/EBPα inducibility. Both the DNA fragment encoding −599 to −88 and that encoding −812 to −599 of the rat 11β-HSD1 gene were able to confer induction by C/EBPα on the SV40 promoter (Fig. 1 B), demonstrating that the promoter contained at least two C/EBPα responsive regions. Neither fragment, however, conferred the same magnitude of inducibility as seen with pr11β1(−812/+49) or pr11β1(−599/+49) (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the fragment encoding −812 to −599 significantly decreased the activity of the SV40 promoter in the absence of C/EBPα (Fig. 1 B), consistent with the location of a repressor element in the region between −812 and −754. Under normal conditions in rat liver, most of the C/EBP-binding activity is attributable to C/EBPα and C/EBPβ (26Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). To see if C/EBPβ is also able to activate the 11β-HSD1 promoter, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with pMSV-C/EBPβ and pr11β1(−1799/+49). Full-length C/EBPβ caused a small but significant induction of transcription from the rat 11β-HSD1 promoter (Fig. 1 C) and, when co-transfected with C/EBPα, resulted in a similar level of pr11β1(−1799/+49) activity to that induced by C/EBPβ alone (Fig.1 C). However, it has been previously shown that removal of the N-terminal 21 amino acids of C/EBPβ decreases production of LIP, an inhibitor of C/EBP activity produced from the C/EBPβmRNA by translation initiating at a downstream ATG (27Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). When an N-terminally truncated C/EBPβ, C/EBPβ(t), was co-transfected into HepG2 cells, it activated transcription from pr11β1(−1799/+49), although to a lesser extent than C/EBPα (Fig. 1 C). As with C/EBPβ, co-transfection of C/EBPβ(t) and C/EBPα resulted in a similar level of pr11β1(−1799/+49) activity to that induced by C/EBPβ(t) alone (Fig. 1 C). DNase I protection analysis was used to identify sites of rat liver nuclear protein interaction with the 11β-HSD1 promoter between −812 and +76 using a series of overlapping restriction fragments, each labeled at the 5′-end on the non-coding strand. Parallel reactions were carried out with bacterially expressed rC/EBPα protein to identify the footprints that may be due to C/EBP-related factors (control bacterial extracts that did not express rC/EBPα did not show any binding to 11β-HSD1 DNA; data not shown). Representative results from the DNase I protection analysis are shown in Fig.2 and summarized in Fig.3. Liver nuclear proteins bind to at least 11 sites on the 11β-HSD1 promoter between −812 and +76. Furthermore, 10 of these sites can be wholly or partially occupied by C/EBP-related proteins.Figure 3Summary of the sites of rat liver nuclear protein binding on the rat 11β-HSD1 gene between −812 and +76. Regions footprinted on the non-coding strand by rat liver nuclear extract are indicated by boxesbelow the sequence. For clarity, the coding (top) strand only is shown.

The CCAAT sequence at −73 to −69 and the GCAAT sequence in the inverse orientation between −63 and −67 were weakly protected only with high concentrations of liver nuclear extract (data not shown), suggesting that these sequences, present in a position typical of such regulatory elements, play little or no role in the expression of 11β-HSD1 in rat liver. Between −599 and −88, six regions, FP3–8, were protected from DNase I digestion by rat liver nuclear extract, all of which were similarly protected by rC/EBPα protein (Fig. 2). In some experiments FP5 appeared to extend to −255, however, in all experiments the region between −224 and −244 was clearly protected. Hypersensitive sites induced by liver nuclear extract (but not by rC/EBPα) were also observed at −498, −510, and −550. Between −812 and −599 two regions, FP9 and FP11, were protected both by liver nuclear extract and by rC/EBPα (Fig. 2). A third region, FP10, was protected by liver nuclear extract but weakly, if at all, by rC/EBPα (Fig. 2). Although this footprint clearly includes −768 to −759, in some experiments protection appeared to extend as far in the 3′ direction as −747 (data not shown), possibly as a result of DNA distortion by liver nuclear extract (see below). rC/EBPα and liver nuclear proteins produced identical footprints at FP11; however, several differences were observed at FP9. Rat liver nuclear extract, but not rC/EBPα, induced a DNase I hypersensitive site at −694, within the protected region (Fig. 2) and also induced a region of hypersensitivity 3′ to FP9 (enhanced cleavage at −663, −661, and −655) (Fig. 2), the extent of which varied with different preparations of extract. Furthermore, those preparations of liver nuclear extract that resulted in the appearance of strong hypersensitive sites at −663 to −655 apparently protected the adjacent DNA (−704 to −664 and approximately −647 to −616) from DNase I digestion as well (Fig. 2and data not shown). Because the adjacent “protected” regions were only seen with preparations of extract that strongly induced the DNase I hypersensitivity, it is likely that they are due to exclusion of DNase I by distortion of DNA rather than protection from DNase I by direct protein binding. The introduction of a mutation into FP2, which dramatically reduced C/EBP binding (data not shown), reduced C/EBPα inducibility of pr11β1(−196/+49) (Fig.4), although it also diminished basal levels of transcription (Fig. 4). Mutation of FP1, within the transcribed region, eliminated C/EBPα induction, while having no effect on basal transcription (Fig. 4). Similarly, mutation of either FP3 or FP4 alone reduced the C/EBPα effect (Fig. 4). Mutation of any two of the footprinted sites together further diminished or even eliminated induction by C/EBPα (Fig. 4), and mutation of FP2, -3, and -4 together both eliminated the induction by C/EBPα and decreased basal levels of transcription (Fig. 4). These data confirm the requirement for C/EBPα binding in the transcriptional activation of the rat 11β-HSD1 promoter. The similarity between the footprints produced by liver nuclear extract and rC/EBPα strongly suggested that the factors present in liver nuclear extract, which bind to the rat 11β-HSD1 promoter, belong to the C/EBP family. To characterize the liver nuclear protein(s) binding to these sites, EMSA analysis was carried out on FP2, spanning the transcription start, and FP9, which exhibited differences between liver nuclear extract and rC/EBPα binding. Several specific protein-DNA complexes were formed on oligonucleotide OA (encoding FP2) by rat liver nuclear extract (Fig.5 A). Competition assays demonstrated that all the specific complexes contained proteins with DNA-binding specificity related to C/EBP; all were similarly competed by OE and OD (encoding an optimal C/EBP binding site and the P3(I) C/EBP binding site from the PEPCK gene, respectively). Oligonucleotides encoding cAMP-responsive elements or AP-1 binding sites also competed for liver nuclear protein binding to a limited extent (data not shown) consistent with the pattern of specificity previously described for C/EBP (28Bakker O. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Little or no competition was seen when oligonucleotides OB and OC (encompassing the CCAAT box at −73 and the GCAAT sequence at −67, respectively, of the 11β-HSD1 gene) were included in EMSA reactions (Fig.5 A). rC/EBPα bound to oligonucleotide OA as a single specific complex of similar electrophoretic mobility to the major complex formed by liver nuclear proteins, and the rC/EBPα-OA complex showed similar (although not identical) competition by oligonucleotides as seen with liver nuclear proteins (Fig. 5 B). Very similar results were obtained with rat liver nuclear extract and rC/EBPα binding to oligonucleotide OF, encompassing FP9 (data not shown), with rank order of competition of oligonucleotides OF ≥ OE > OA > OD ≫ OC ≥ OB= ONS, showing that FP9 also represents a high affinity site for C/EBP-related proteins. Addition of antiserum specific for C/EBPα to EMSAs demonstrated that the majority of the complexes formed by liver nuclear extract on OA include C/EBPα (Fig. 5 C). Addition of C/EBPβ antiserum supershifted a minor proportion of the complexes, however, addition of both antisera together supershifted all but one specific complex (Fig."

For activation, most nucleoside analogs require conversion to the triphosphate metabolite by several cellular enzymes. Our previous studies have shown that l-OddC can be phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to its monophosphate metabolite, which is further phosphorylated by cellular kinases to its di- and triphosphate metabolites (2Grove K.L. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4187-4191PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grove K.L. Guo X. Liu S.H. Gao Z. Chu C.K. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3008-3011PubMed Google Scholar). The latter form of l-OddC can be incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerases α, β, δ, γ, and εin vitro (8Kukhanova M. Liu S.H. Mozzherin D. Lin T.S. Chu C.K. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23055-23059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since l-OddC lacks a hydroxyl group at the 3′-position, it causes premature termination of DNA replication once incorporated and eventually leads to cell death. This chain termination is probably the major mechanism of action ofl-OddC. We have also shown previously that the cytotoxicity of this drug is directly related to the steady-state level ofl-OddC in DNA (2Grove K.L. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4187-4191PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state level of l-OddC in DNA is not only dependent on incorporation by DNA polymerases but also on the excision by DNA repair enzymes. We have previously observed that incorporatedl-OddCMP could be excised from the DNA in cells (2Grove K.L. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4187-4191PubMed Google Scholar). However, of the several DNA exonucleases that have been studied to date, all showed preference for d- overl-configuration nucleoside analogs at the 3′ termini of DNA (8Kukhanova M. Liu S.H.

In this study, we used the nuclei from leukemic cells of patients to identify the major enzymatic activity that removes l-OddCMP from DNA as human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) DNA endonuclease (APE1), also known as HAP-1 or Ref-1 (1Demple B.

APE1 is a 35-kDa monomeric protein that possesses multiple activities related to DNA metabolism. APE1 belongs to the class II AP endonucleases and is the major cellular enzyme responsible for repairing AP sites in DNA (1Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 16Robson C.N. Milne A.M. Pappin D.J. Hickson I.D.

The DNA repair activities reside in the C-terminal region (22Izumi T. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). APE1 initiates the DNA base excision repair by cleaving the DNA immediately adjacent to the 5′ of an AP site to produce a hydroxyl group at the 3′ terminus of an unmodified nucleotide upstream of the nick and a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate moiety downstream. The product of APE1 is further processed by DNA polymerase β to release 5′-deoxyribose phosphate with its intrinsic lyase activity and to fill up the one-nucleotide gap with its DNA polymerase activity (23Bennett R.A. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The nicked DNA is then sealed by DNA ligase I or DNA ligase III/XRCC1 to complete this repair process. In addition to the AP endonuclease activity, APE1 also possesses a 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease activity, a 3′-phosphodiesterase activity, a 3′-phosphatase activity, and a RNaseH activity (24Chaudhry M.A. Dedon P.C. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Demple B. Weinfeld M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). APE1 also contains a number of potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinases I and II (25Yacoub A. Kelley M.R. Deutsch W.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5457-5459PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fritz G. Kaina B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the impact of post-translational phosphorylation on the DNA repair activity of APE1 is not clear at this time. In addition to its DNA repair activities, APE1 plays a role in regulating gene expression. The N-terminal domain of this protein has a redox regulatory function (17Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 27Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S.

Through this domain, APE1 mediates the reductive activation of oxidized proteins such as c-Jun and c-Fos as well as Myb, nuclear factor κB, and members of CREB family to facilitate their specific DNA binding ability (18Xanthoudakis S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A mouse knock-out of APE1 resulted in an embryonic lethal phenotype (30Xanthoudakis S. Smeyne R.J. Wallace J.D. Curran T. Proc.

The 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease activity was reported to be between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude less efficient than the AP endonuclease activity (32Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J.

The exonuclease activity of APE1 showed a preference forl-configuration nucleoside analogs over the naturald-configuration analogs. Moreover, the product of APE1 exonuclease could also be extended by polymerases, which suggested that APE1 could be the key enzyme involved in removingl-configuration nucleoside analogs from the 3′ termini of DNA. The potential importance of this APE1 exonuclease activity in determining the toxicity of deoxyribonucleoside analogs is discussed.

All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology, Inc. (Coralville, IA) and further purified by electrophoresis on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To facilitate monitoring the 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease activity that removed l-OddC from the 3′ termini of DNA and to avoid possible false results introduced by contaminating 5′-phosphatase or 5′-3′ DNA exonucleases in the purification process, oligonucleotide A (Sequence 1) was 3′-labeled with [α−32P]dATP and further extended with OddCMP by E. coli DNA polymerase Klenow fragment (exonuclease-free) enzyme in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dTT, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 5 min. To monitor other exonucleases with different substrate preferences, double-stranded oligonucleotide B (Sequence 2) was labeled with [α−32P]dCTP usingE. coli DNA polymerase Klenow fragment in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dTT, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 5 min. The products were purified using G-50 spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to remove radioactive nucleotides.

The reaction was stopped by adding 4 μl of loading solution (90% formamide, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and heating at 80 °C for 3 min. Samples (3 μl) were loaded onto a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, which was electrophoresed in 1× TBE buffer. The gel was then dried under vacuum and subjected to autoradiography and a phosphor-imaging screen (Bio-Rad). All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The buffers used in purification were as follows: buffer A, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm KCl, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20% glycerol; buffer B, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20% glycerol; buffer C, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 600 mm KCl, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20% glycerol; buffer D, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m KCl, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20% glycerol; buffer E, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20% glycerol. The 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease that removedl-OddCMP was purified from the nuclei of acute lymphocytic leukemia cells removed by leukophoresis from patients in blast crisis. The procedures for purifying cellular nuclei from leukemic cells were described (11Skalski V. Liu S.H. Cheng Y.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Frozen nuclei pellets (50 g) were thawed in 150 ml of buffer A. The nuclei debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,500 rpm for 60 min, and the supernatant was collected (fraction I) for further purification. A DE52 anion exchange column was used to remove nucleic acids from the supernatant of the crude extract. A 50-ml DE52 column was packed and equilibrated with buffer A. Fraction I was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, the column was washed with 3 bed volumes of buffer A. Both the flow-through and wash fractions were collected and pooled (fraction II). Fraction II was dialyzed against buffer B until it had the same conductivity as buffer B before it was loaded onto a 50-ml P11 column preequilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer B followed by a 500-ml linear gradient of buffer B to buffer C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected and analyzed for exonuclease activity. The active ones were pooled (fraction III). Fraction III was dialyzed against buffer B and loaded onto a buffer B-preequilibrated DE 52 column. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer B. The proteins were eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of buffer B to buffer C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected and assayed for exonuclease activity. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (fraction IV). A 15-ml single-stranded DNA cellulose column was packed and preequilibrated with buffer B. Fraction IV was loaded onto the column and washed with 3 column volumes of buffer B. The column was eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of buffer B to buffer C at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected, analyzed, pooled, and dialyzed against buffer D (fraction V). Fraction V was loaded onto a 2-ml buffer D-preequilibrated phenyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer D before the application of a 25-ml linear gradient of buffer D to buffer E at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The flow-through (fraction VI) and the active fractions eluted from the column (fraction VII) were collected, pooled, and dialyzed against buffer B. Fractions VI and VII were loaded onto two separate 1-ml P11 columns and eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of buffer B to buffer C. Active fractions were collected and pooled (fractions VIII and IX, respectively). Fractions VIII and IX were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The 3′-5′ DNA exonuclease activity was detected in situ after SDS-PAGE by activity gel electrophoresis, following the method of Longley and Mosbaugh (45Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was prepared with the addition of 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 nm f1-K12 single-stranded DNA (Sequence 6, bottom), which was annealed to an [α−32P]dATP-labeled oligonucleotide withl-OddCMP at the 3′ terminus (Sequence 6, top) as shown. 5′−CCA GGG TTT TCC CAG TCA CG32P AOdd C−3′ 3′−GGT CCC AAA AGG GTC AGT GC T G−5′SEQUENCE 6 Samples (20 μl) from fractions VIII and IX were loaded on the gel for electrophoresis at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, SDS was extracted from the gel at room temperature by two 30-min incubations with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 25% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. To renature the proteins, the gel was then shaken gently at 4 °C overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20% glycerol to renature the proteins. The exonuclease activity was renatured by shaking the gel for 3 h at 37 °C in renaturation buffer supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2. The gel was subsequently dried, and the exonuclease activity was visualized by autoradiography. The ∼35-kDa polypeptide on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which correlated with exonuclease activity from fraction IX in the activity gel analysis, was excised and sent for MALDI protein analysis at the HHMI Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Yale University). To further confirm the result of MALDI protein analysis, we performed a Western blot experiment with a monoclonal APE1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO). Sample (20 μl) from fraction IX was loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed. The proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS supplemented with 0.002% Tween 20 before the addition of monoclonal APE1 antibody. The membrane was later developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized by exposure to an Eastman Kodak Co. MR film. DNA substrates with different deoxyribonucleoside analogs at the 3′ terminus were made to assess the APE1 exonuclease activity. The different deoxyribonucleoside analogs were incorporated into 32P-5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide C by incubating 20 μm of the nucleoside 5′-triphosphate analogs and 1 unit of HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV RT) at 37 °C for 30 min. The desired oligonucleotide products were purified by electrophoresis on a 20% urea/polyacrylamide gel followed by excising the bands and shaking them gently in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA overnight at room temperature to extract the oligonucleotides. These single-stranded oligonucleotides were then annealed to a 33-mer template to form partial double-stranded DNA substrates. These DNA substrates were incubated with same amount of APE1 under the standard exonuclease assay condition, and the result was analyzed on a 12.5% urea/polyacrylamide gel. The gel was subsequently dried followed by autoradiography. To demonstrate that the DNA product of APE1 was extendable by DNA polymerase after removingl-OddCMP, a primer extension reaction was performed using HIV RT. After a 30-min incubation of APE1 with l-OddC terminated DNA in the exonuclease assay condition described earlier, 0.5 units of HIV RT and 30 μm dNTPs were added to the reaction mixture to a final volume of 15 μl for another 5-min incubation at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 6 μl of gel loading solution and heating at 80 °C for 3 min before analysis on a 12.5% urea/polyacrylamide gel. The presence of exonuclease activity that removed l-OddCMP was detected in nucleic acid-free crude extract (fraction II). Two l-OddCMP exonuclease activity peaks were observed in the fractions from the P11 column (Fig. 2 a). The first activity peak was eluted between 250 and 290 mm KCl, and the second activity peak (fraction III) was eluted between 400 and 500 mm KCl. Meanwhile, there was only one broad activity without a distinct peak when deoxycytidine-terminated oligonucleotide B was used as substrate (Fig. 2 b). The latter eluted from the column between 250 and 570 mm KCl. The lower bands in Fig.2 a are the released [α-32P]dAMP from oligonucleotide A, an indication of the exonuclease action. The dNMPs were sequentially excised after the removal of l-OddCMP by this exonuclease. The 20-mer oligonucleotide product after the removal of l-OddCMP was not always observed, perhaps due to the excess amount of enzyme. However, the distribution of activities in the eluted fractions from column chromatography were different when oligonucleotide A or B was employed, as represented by the intensity of released [α-32P]dAMP at the bottom of the gel. This result suggested that the exonucleases in different fractions had different substrate specificity. Since our purpose was to purify the major exonuclease, which removed l-OddCMP, fraction III was chosen for further purification. Fraction III was further purified using a DE52 anion exchange column. As shown in Fig. 3 a, most of the observed exonuclease activity was not retained on the column (fraction IV) when either l-OddCMP- or dCMP-terminated oligonucleotide DNAs were used as substrates. An insignificant exonuclease activity was found to be bound to the column and had a preference for natural DNA substrate (oligonucleotide B) instead ofl-OddCMP (oligonucleotide A). Fraction IV was further purified using a single-stranded DNA column. The exonuclease eluted from the column between the concentrations of 220 and 350 mm KCl (fraction V) (Fig. 3 b). This was the"

https://openalex.org/W2152044329,"Abstract The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax oncoprotein deregulates the NF-κB signaling pathway by persistently stimulating a key signal transducer, the IκB kinase (IKK). Tax physically associates with the IKK regulatory subunit, IKKγ, although the underlying biochemical mechanism and functional significance remain unclear. We show that the Tax-IKKγ interaction requires two homologous leucine zipper domains located within IKKγ. These leucine zipper domains are unique for the presence of a conserved upstream region that is essential for Tax binding. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis revealed that a leucine-repeat region of Tax is important for IKKγ binding. Interestingly, all the Tax mutants defective in IKKγ binding failed to engage the IKK complex or stimulate IKK activity, and these functional defects can be rescued by fusing the Tax mutants to IKKγ. These results provide mechanistic insights into how Tax specifically targets and functionally activates the cellular kinase IKK."

The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria adds further complexity to protein secretion, because of the presence of an outer membrane in addition to the cytoplasmic membrane. Various protein secretion pathways have been developed by these organisms. Newly synthesized exoproteins devoid of a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide take Sec-independent pathways, mostly the ABC transporter-based type I system (1Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5804-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Thanabalu T. Koronakis E.

Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4187-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, exoproteins synthesized with a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide cross the cell envelope in two steps (7Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are first translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane via the ubiquitous Sec machinery and reach the periplasm following proteolytic removal of their signal peptides. They are then translocated across the outer membrane by one of various systems called the terminal branches of the general export pathway. A widely used system of this kind is the type II secretory pathway, a multiprotein cell envelope machinery (7Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bordetella pertussis, the whooping cough agent, secretes several toxins, enzymes, and adhesins essential to its pathogenicity (8Locht C. Int. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 137-144PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, its main adhesin, filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), is secreted in large quantities into the extracellular milieu (9Locht C. Bertin P. Menozzi F.D. Renauld G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The highly efficient secretion pathway of FHA requires a single specific accessory protein, FhaC, located in the outer membrane (10Willems R.J.L. Geuijen C. van der Heide H.G.J. Renauld G.

Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). FHA has a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide and is likely to cross the cytoplasmic membrane via the Bordetella Sec machinery (12Lambert-Buisine C. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It then transits through the periplasm and interacts specifically with FhaC to reach the cell surface. FHA most likely crosses the outer membrane in an extended conformation and acquires its tertiary structure at the cell surface, following an extensive C-terminal proteolytic maturation (13Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Renauld-Mongénie G. Cornette J. Mielcarek N. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. J.

FhaC belongs to a family of accessory outer membrane proteins involved in the secretion of hemolysins or adhesins in various Gram-negative pathogens (10Willems R.J.L. Geuijen C. van der Heide H.G.J.

FHA shares with these hemolysins and adhesins N-proximal motifs involved in secretion and hypothesized to interact with FhaC (20Delisse-Gathoye A.-M. Locht C. Jacob F. Raaschou-Nielsen M. Heron I. Ruelle J.-L. De Wilde M. Cabezon T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2895-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schönherr R. Tsolis R. Focareta T. Braun V. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 775-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, FhaC and homologs form a family of outer membrane transporters, which probably represents a distinct terminal branch of the general export pathway. Despite their homology, FhaC and its hemolysin-secreting relatives are not exchangeable, indicating the molecular specificity of these systems (22Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Willery E. Renauld-Mongénie G. Locht C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 775-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both FhaC and its Serratia marcescens homolog ShlB have recently been shown to form sugar- or ion-permeable pores in artificial membranes (23Könninger U.W. Hobbie S. Benz R. Braun V. Mol.

Therefore, our current model on the mode of action of FhaC is that it forms specific channels in the outer membrane for the outward translocation of FHA. According to circular dichroism analyses, FhaC contains approximately 40% β-structure (24Jacob-Dubuisson F. El-Hamel C. Saint N. Guédin S. Willery E. Molle G. Locht C. J. Biol.

Furthermore, its sequence is rich in amphipathic stretches that could form a β-barrel in the outer membrane. In this study, a working model for the topology of FhaC was constructed. It was tested by assessing the accessibility of inserted recognition sites for an antibody and a protease. Our results indicate that FhaC probably forms a transmembrane β-barrel with an unprecedented uneven number of strands such that the N terminus of the protein is extracellular, whereas its C terminus is periplasmic. The unique BamHI restriction site of pEC24 (13Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was eliminated by treatment with Klenow enzyme following linearization of the plasmid. The resulting pEC24ΔBamHI was digested using the following restriction enzymes that generate blunt ends and cut within fhaC:Eco47III, NruI, EcoRV,NaeI, PvuII, XmnI, HaeIII,BstUI, RsaI, MspAI, ScaI,EheI, BsaAI, or HincII. Partial restrictions were performed in the presence of ethidium bromide (25–75 μg/ml final concentration) (25Barany F. DNA Protein Eng. Technol. 1988; 1: 29-44Google Scholar). A nonphosphorylated palindromic 6-mer BamHI linker, 5′-GGATCC-3′, was ligated with the linearized plasmid. The positions of BamHI in fhaC were determined by DNA sequencing with several primers internal to fhaC, using the ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer from Perkin-Elmer. The resulting plasmids were called pFccx (where x represents the position of the codon with a BamHI insert). In addition, BamHI sites were introduced in positions 125 and 503 by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites® II kit from Promega (Charbonnières, France) with the oligonucleotides 5′-CGTGGTGGATGGCGGATCCGTGCTCAAGCTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CATCCCGACGCGGGATCCCGCACGATACGCATG-3′, respectively (the BamHI sites are underlined). The sequence of fhaCwas verified by DNA sequencing. In position 532, a BamHI site was inserted by a double polymerase chain reaction using pEC24 as a template and the oligonucleotides 5′-GTGGGCGCGGATGTCGGAGCGCTCA-3′ and 5′-CGCGCCGGATCCCACGGGCTTCGAGTACGTGAACGA-3′, and 5′-TAAGCTTGGCTGCAGGTCGACCCGG-3′ and 5′-CCCGTGGGATCCGGCGCGCAGCCCGGCGGCGCACCA-3′ as primers (the BamHI sites are underlined). Following a polymerase chain reaction with a mixture of the two amplicons as a template and the two outermost oligonucleotides as primers, the new amplicon was restricted by Eco47III and NotI and cloned into pEC24ΔBamHI to replace the corresponding fhaCfragment. The inserted fragment was sequenced entirely. For the construction of the pMycx series, three pairs of nonphosphorylated oligonucleotides coding for the c-Myc epitope, EQKLISEEDL, in the three reading frames were used: 5′-GATCCGAACAGAAGCTGATCTCGGAAGAGGATCTGGGCCCCG-3′ and 5′-GATCCGGGGCCCAGATCCTCTTCCGAGATCAGCTTCTGTTCG-3′; 5′-GATCCGGAACAGAAGCTGATCTCGGAAGAGGATCTGGGCCCG-3′ and 5′-GATCCGGGCCCAGATCCTCTTCCGAGATCAGCTTCTGTTCCG-3′; and 5′-GATCGGAGAACAGAAGCTGATCTCGGAAGAGGATCTGGGCCCACG-3′ and 5′-GATCCGTGGGCCCAGATCCTCTTCCGAGATCAGCTTCTGTTCTCC-3′ (the ApaI sites used to screen the recombinant clones are underlined). The appropriate double-stranded linkers were ligated with various BamHI-restricted pFccx, to generate the corresponding in-frame c-Myc insertions. Similarly, for the construction of the pTEVx series, three pairs of oligonucleotides coding for the cleavage site of the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, ENLYFQG, were used: 5′-GATCCAGGAAAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGGGCCCGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCGGGCCCCCTGGAAGTACAGGTTTTCCGT-3′; 5′-GATCTGGAAAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGGGCCCGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCGGGCCCCCTGGAAGTACAGGTTTTCCA-3′; and 5′-GATCCGAAAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGGGCCCGTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCACGGGCCCCCTGGAAGTACAGGTTTTCG-3′. The sequence and orientation of each insert were determined by DNA sequencing. For expression of the fhaC derivatives in B. pertussis, selected pFccx, pMycx, and pTEVx were restricted by PvuI and SacI. The resulting fragments corresponding to fhaC derivatives were cloned into pFJD16Δ (24Jacob-Dubuisson F. El-Hamel C. Saint N. Guédin S. Willery E. Molle G. Locht C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37731-37735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to replace the wild type fhaC fragment, resulting in pFcbx, pMycbx, or pTEVbx plasmids. Deletions in fhaC were obtained by combining the 5′ portion of the gene from a given pFccx with the 3′ portion of fhaC from a given pFccy with BamHI in the same reading frame further down the gene, resulting in internal truncations of fhaC from codons x to y.

E. coli UT5600 producing c-Myc-FhaC or TEV-FhaC derivatives were grown to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 1, resuspended in 16 volume of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 μg/ml DNase, 0.5 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by a passage in a French pressure cell. Total membranes were pelleted by a centrifugation for 1 h at 50,000 × g at 12 °C. The preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For dot immunoblotting, 30 μl of total membranes were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was incubated with the anti-c-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The rat antiserum against FhaC was prepared by Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium) and purified by chromatography on CNBr-activated Sepharose saturated with an E. coli lysate. The anti-porin antiserum was raised in a rabbit. The immunoblots were developed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by the addition of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate if the primary antibodies were polyclonal and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit from NEN Life Science Products if the primary antibody was monoclonal, unless otherwise indicated. 1-ml culture aliquots of E. coli UT5600 producing each of the c-Myc-FhaC derivatives grown to an A600 of 1 were centrifuged to harvest the cells. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 100 mm EDTA (26Merck K.B. De Cock H. Verheij H.M. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-c-Myc mAb. The addition of EDTA to the cells appeared to increase the percentage of labeled cells, while it did not expose epitopes that were shielded in its absence (not shown). After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with anti-mouse fluorescein isocyanate-conjugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Then three washes with phosphate-buffered saline were performed before the detection of fluorescent cells in a flow cytometer (FACSort, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. For digestions on intact cells,E. coli UT5600 producing the TEV-FhaC derivatives with or without Fha44, were grown to an A600 of 1 at 600 nm. When required, 1 mm isopropyl-β-D thiogalactopyranoside was added to the cultures to induce Fha44 synthesis for 1 h. Cells from 1-ml aliquots were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended into 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA. For proteolysis, 10 mmdithiothreitol and 100 units of TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to 80 μl of cells, and the digestion was performed at 30 °C for 4 h (27Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 12% trichloroacetic acid, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using the anti-FhaC antibodies. To construct a working model of the topology of FhaC, the following approach was used (28Tommassen J. NATO ASI (Adv. Sci. Inst.) Ser. H Cell Biol. 1988; 16: 352-373Google Scholar). First, the amino acid sequence of FhaC was aligned with those of six homologs,i.e. HpmB, ShlB, HhdB, EthB, HMW1B, and HxuB (data not shown). This alignment was used to identify hypervariable regions, which usually correspond to the cell surface-exposed domains of outer membrane proteins. All sequences were used to identify potential β-turns, using the criteria described by Paul and Rosenbusch (29Paul C. Rosenbusch J.P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1593-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), as adapted for β-sheet proteins. These turns are predicted to be surface-exposed or periplasmically exposed. The sequences were then scanned for putative β-strands consisting of stretches of approximately 10 residues containing nonpolar amino acids (according to the normalized consensus scale of Eisenberg (30Eisenberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 595-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar)) at every second position, which could form a β-sheet configuration. Putative β-strands with flanking aromatic residues were favored wherever possible because rings of aromatic residues surround the β-barrels on both sides of the membrane in all outer membrane proteins of which the structures have been solved. The vast majority of bacterial outer membrane proteins contain a consensus sequence at the C terminus, consisting of a C-terminal phenylalanine preceded at every second position by four nonpolar amino acids (31Struyvé M. Moons M. Tommassen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This consensus sequence is also present in FhaC and its homologs. In all outer membrane proteins of which the structures have been solved, this segment of the protein forms a membrane-spanning β-strand with an Nout-Cin topology. Hence, we assume that the same is true for the C-terminal segment of FhaC. Model building then proceeded from the C terminus toward the N terminus reconciling the sequence features described above with features indicating potential short turns at the periplasmic side, long loops on the cell surface, and transmembrane strands of 6–12 amino acids. Potential conservation of these features in the homologs of FhaC was demanded. The resulting topology model of FhaC is depicted in Fig.1. The topology of FhaC was studied by insertion of epitopes within the protein. First, a collection of mutants was generated by random BamHI linker insertions into fhaC (25Barany F. DNA Protein Eng. Technol. 1988; 1: 29-44Google Scholar). Each of the 48 clones contains a single linker (Lnk) insertion in fhaC, the position of which is given by the number of the codon within or after which the unique BamHI site was inserted. The numbering corresponds to mature FhaC (Fig. 1). Since FhaC is functional in E. coli for the secretion of an 80-kDa FHA derivative named Fha44 (11Jacob-Dubuisson F. Buisine C. Mielcarek N. Clément E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we used this expression system for most of the following experiments. The 48 mutant alleles were expressed from pEC24, an fhaC-bearing plasmid for the production of FhaC in E. coli UT5600 at a level similar to that in B. pertussis (13Guédin S. Willery E. Locht C. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All 48 Lnk-FhaC derivatives were detected in the membranes of E. coli, although some of them at a somewhat lower level than wild type FhaC (Fig. 2). Their activities were analyzed by assessing the secretion of Fha44. Some Lnk-FhaC derivatives did not secrete Fha44 into the culture supernatant, suggesting that their function may be affected by the 2-amino acid residue insert. A few other mutant proteins showed a reduced secretion activity (Fig. 2). In agreement with the topology model, several inactive Lnk-FhaC derivatives (positions 111, 243, 288, 314, 430, 486, and 527) had an insert within or very close to a predicted transmembrane segment, which could disrupt the structure of the protein. However, Lnk125-, Lnk232-, Lnk513-, Lnk550- and Lnk551-FhaC were active, although their inserts were also within predicted transmembrane segments. To detect very low levels of activity, the more sensitive assay of fhaC-deficient B. pertussis BPEC complementation was used for some mutants. Lnk33-, Lnk243-, and Link434-FhaC derivatives proved to be slightly active for FHA secretion in B. pertussis, whereas Lnk104-, Lnk134-, and Lnk462-FhaC were not (Fig. 2). The lack of activity of mutant proteins with insertions outside predicted transmembrane segments may point to regions that are important for the structure or the function of FhaC. To determine whether their structure was affected, some of these inactive mutant proteins were tested for heat modifiability. This property is typical of β-rich integral outer membrane proteins, including FhaC (24Jacob-Dubuisson F. El-Hamel C. Saint N. Guédin S. Willery E. Molle G. Locht C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37731-37735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Lnk307-FhaC, Lnk342-FhaC, and Lnk462-FhaC were heat-modifiable (Fig.2), arguing against major conformational alterations. In contrast, Lnk104-FhaC, Lnk134-FhaC, Lnk314-FhaC, and Lnk527-FhaC were not heat-modifiable. Together, these results indicate that FhaC is fairly tolerant to short insertions. The Lnk-FhaC derivatives that retained full or partial activity or heat modifiability were used for epitope insertion. The c-Myc epitope, EQKLISEEDL, was inserted into various positions using the BamHI sites generated above. Envelopes of E. coliUT5600 producing the c-Myc-FhaC derivatives were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FhaC antibodies (Fig.3 A). All of the c-Myc-FhaC derivatives were produced, except for c-Myc88-FhaC and c-Myc395-FhaC. However, insertion of another peptide at these positions did not interfere with the production of FhaC (see below), suggesting that the very sequence of the inserted epitope can affect the stability of the protein. The envelopes of E. coli UT5600 cells producing each c-Myc-FhaC were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-c-Myc mAb. Except for c-Myc88- and c-Myc395-FhaC, the epitope was detected in all FhaC derivatives (Fig. 3 B). However, the relative levels of c-Myc reactivity of the mutant proteins did not correlate well with their levels of production. In addition, the electrophoretic mobilities of the FhaC derivatives were somewhat heterogeneous. These observations suggest that some proteins may not have been fully denatured or may have locally renatured during SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The activities of the FhaC derivatives were assessed by the secretion of Fha44 into E. coli culture supernatants. In addition, heat modifiability of the mutant proteins was analyzed to determine whether their structure was affected by the insertions. Fha44 secretion and heat modifiability correlated well in the sense that both were abolished in several cases. This suggested that c-Myc insertions in various parts of the protein, especially in the second part of the loop L1 and in the loop L2 probably disrupted its structure (TableII).Table IICharacterization of the c-Myc-FhaC derivativesPosition of insertionActivity of mutant in E. coliHeat modifiabilitySurface accessibility of c-Myc (percentage of labeled cells)Accessibility of c-Myc on envelopes%3+−+31+26+−+14+47++15+73−−1+79−−4−93−−0.6±104−2-aAbsence of FHA secretion in B. pertussis.−1±125++3+150−−2+171−−2+193−−0.4+206−2-bDetectable FHA secretion in B. pertussis.+0.7±221−−0.5±260+−+1.4+307−+1−322−2-bDetectable FHA secretion in B. pertussis.−1.7−367++0.2−383−+1+416+−−0.4−434−2-bDetectable FHA secretion in B. pertussis.+49+462−2-aAbsence of FHA secretion in B. pertussis.−0.8±503++50+532++0.9−551−−36+E. coli UT5600 producing the c-Myc-FhaC derivatives were analyzed for the secretion activity of the mutant proteins (column 2), their heat modifiability (column 3), and the accessibility of the c-Myc epitope at the cell surface (column 4) and on cell envelopes (column 5).

https://openalex.org/W2158130734,"CTCF is a unique, highly conserved, and ubiquitously expressed 11 zinc finger (ZF) transcriptional factor with multiple DNA site specificities. It is able to bind to varying target sequences to perform different regulatory roles, including promoter activation or repression, creating hormone-responsive gene silencing elements, and functional block of enhancer-promoter interactions. Because different sets of ZFs are utilized to recognize different CTCF target DNA sites, each of the diverse DNA·CTCF complexes might engage different essential protein partners to define distinct functional readouts. To identify such proteins, we developed an affinity chromatography method based on matrix-immobilized purified recombinant CTCF. This approach resulted in isolation of several CTCF protein partners. One of these was identified as the multifunctional Y-box DNA/RNA-binding factor, YB-1, known to be involved in transcription, replication, and RNA processing. We examined CTCF/YB-1 interaction by reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-CTCF and anti-YB-1 antibodies, and found that CTCF and YB-1 form complexes in vivo. We show that the bacterially expressed ZF domain of CTCF is fully sufficient to retain YB-1 in vitro. To assess possible functional significance of CTCF/YB-1 binding, we employed the very first identified by us, negatively regulated, target for CTCF (c-myc oncogene promoter) as a model in co-transfection assays with both CTCF and YB-1 expression vectors. Although expression of YB-1 alone had no effect, co-expression with CTCF resulted in a marked enhancement of CTCF-driven c-myc transcriptional repression.

CTCF appears to act differently upon binding to functionally distinct regulatory elements, which include: 1) enhancer-blocking (insulator) elements in the two boundaries flanking the β-globin locus, in the T-cell receptor α/γ locus site, and in a matrix attachment 5′-boundary of the chicken lysozyme gene (see Refs. 11Saitoh N.

Moreover, CTCF is recently found to be a parent of the origin-specific and methylation-sensitive functional component of the chromatin insulator(s) upstream of the H19 gene (12Kanduri C. Pant V.

CTCF-dependent insulators do not act as general transcription repressors or activators, but, rather, block functional interaction between an enhancer and a promoter (11Saitoh N. Bell A.C.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2286-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This diverse variety of functions indicates that, following the interaction with different sequences, the unique CTCF·DNA complexes might acquire distinct conformations that behave as sequence-specific platforms for selective binding of other proteins, which, in turn, define specific functional role of CTCF in this setting. In support of this hypothesis, we previously demonstrated that interaction of CTCF with two different DNA sequences of identical length results in distinct patterns of protein protection against proteolytic attack (6Filippova G. Fagerlie S. Klenova E. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P. Collins S. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of CTCF-interacting protein partners appears to be necessary to elucidate biological consequences of CTCF binding to different targets. To search for proteins interacting with CTCF, we developed a reliable and simple affinity chromatography method for fractionation of nuclear extracts on a matrix coupled with purified CTCF protein expressed in a baculovirus system. One of the proteins retained by, and then eluted from, this matrix was found to be another multifunctional factor, YB-1. YB-1 is a member of the family of Y-box binding factors with each member containing some degree of homology to the cold shock domain (20Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). YB-1 is believed to participate in regulation of such diverse functions as transcription, replication, and RNA turnover (for reviews see Refs. 20Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sommerville J. Ladomery M.

Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, YB-1 and YB-1-like proteins participate in DNA repair. They can also promote DNA unwinding and DNA and RNA condensation (20Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M.

Given these properties, we predict that interactions between CTCF and YB-1 are likely to play multiple roles in regulation of major cellular processes. In our initial attempt to assess whether there is a functional consequence of CTCF/YB-1 heterodimerization, we employed a transcriptional activity reporter system utilizing the very first CTCF-targeted promoter identified by us in the chicken c-myconcogene locus (2Lobanenkov V.V. Goodwin G.H. Proc. Acad. Sci. USSR (Moscow). 1989; 309: 741-745Google Scholar, 3Lobanenkov V.V. Adler V.V. Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Goodwin G.H. Papas T.S.

Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7612-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that, although expression of YB-1 alone had no effect on c-myc reporter activity, co-expression of YB-1 with CTCF resulted in a marked enhancement of CTCF-dependent transcriptional repression. These findings provide the first example of what may be multiple functional roles for CTCF/YB-1 interactions. The baculovirus expression system was utilized to obtain pure CTCF protein. To generate baculovirus that would expresses recombinant His-tagged CTCF we engineered the pVLH-CTCF vector based on the pVLH6 plasmid kindly provided by R. M. Marais (CRC Center for Cell and Molecular Biology, London). The pVLH-CTCF was co-transfected with the Baculogold baculovirus DNA into SF9 cells, and recombinants were selected, characterized, and amplified following the manufacturer's instructions (BacVector System Manual, Novagen). The CTCF protein (termed “baculoCTCF”) was purified to 80–90% purity from infected SF9 cells using Ni-affinity chromatography with a linear gradient of imidazole for elution and subsequent gel filtration on an S-200 column (see Fig. 1 A). BaculoCTCF protein (see Fig. 1 A) served as a “molecular hook” to pull out CTCF-interacting proteins from cell extracts. For this purpose, the baculoCTCF was first covalently coupled to the Sepharose 4B matrix using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl chloroformate-activated Sepharose 4B (both reagents from Sigma) to attach the protein. The protein solution was dialyzed against 1 m NaCl/0.1m Na2HPO4, pH 8.2, and mixed with the activated resin in a protein/matrix ratio of 2 mg/1 ml. The binding reaction was performed overnight at +4 °C. The suspension was filtered to remove non-incorporated material and then blocked with 1m ethanolamine, pH 8.2. Next, cell extracts were obtained from the chicken erythroid precursor cells HD3 (32Beug H. von Kirchbach A. Doderlein G. Conscience J.F. Graf T. Cell. 1979; 18: 375-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. An equal amount of the same buffer without NaCl or Nonidet P-40 was added, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. The cleared extracts in the 0.25m NaCl-containing buffer were passed through the baculoCTCF affinity column. Weakly bound proteins were washed off with the low-salt buffer while strongly interacting proteins were subsequently eluted with the same buffer containing 1 mNaCl. The eluted baculoCTCF-interacting partners were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Well resolved protein bands were excised from gels and subjected to the “in-gel” digestion according to the method previously described by Shevchenko and colleagues (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). The MALDI-MS system on the LaserMat 2000 (ThermoBioAnalysis, Middlesex, UK) was utilized to map the mass of the tryptic mixture derived from each band (34Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1791-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The mass values obtained by the analysis of the tryptic digests were used to inspect the SwissProt protein data base using the MS-Fit program available on the WEB from the UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility. One of the proteins was tentatively identified as the Y box binding protein-1 (YB-1). For immunoprecipitation, HeLa cells (∼2 × 106) were collected, washed twice with the ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 500 μl of high salt RIPA buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, supplemented with 1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as described previously (35Towatari M.

After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, 500 μl of RIPA buffer without NaCl was added to cell lysates, which were then cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. CTCF and YB-1 were immunoprecipitated, respectively, by polyclonal affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to CTCF (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and YB-1 (kindly provided by H.-D. Royer and A. Lee (36Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248PubMed Google Scholar)). The anti-CTCF antibodies were raised against the bacterially expressed human CTCF carboxyl-terminal domain and recognize CTCF in all vertebrates due to the exceptionally high evolutionarily conservation of CTCF protein sequence (5Klenova E.

Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P. Collins S. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Other antibodies for co-immunoprecipitation experiments were used against several nuclear proteins, including p21, ubiquitous nuclear receptor UR, thyroid receptor TRα, hTAF II 130, and MYC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The immunoprecipitates obtained with the rabbit polyclonal antibodies were then incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose-4B-Fast (Sigma), while the precipitates obtained with the mouse monoclonal antibodies were incubated with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose-CL4B (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl. Immobilized proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), and probed by Western blot analysis procedure as described below. We initially prepared the pCITE4b-hCTCF-C plasmid containing the 0.8-kbp NcoI to EaeI DNA fragment from the p7.1 human CTCF cDNA plasmid (6Filippova G. Fagerlie S. Klenova E. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P. Collins S. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) cloned into the NcoI and NotI sites of pCITE-4b (Novagen, Madison, WI) downstream of the viral cap independent translational enhancer (CITE). This vector encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain of CTCF extending from the Met residue in the middle of the 11th zinc finger to the stop codon (amino acids 589–727, see Fig. 4 A). Next, we constructed a bacterial expression vector pET16b-CTCF-C for purification of the His-tagged CTCF-C protein. The NdeI-XhoI DNA fragment from the pCITE4b-hCTCF-C plasmid was re-ligated to theNdeI and XhoI ends of the pET16b (Novagen) resulting in pET/hCTCF-C. This vector contains, under an inducible promoter, a coding region for the in-frame fusion between the His-Tag polypeptide, Met-Gly-(His10-tag)-Ser-Ser-Gly-His-Ile-Glu-Arg-His, the S-tag polypeptide derived from the pCITE4b, and the hCTCF-C region. To improve the coupling of the bacterially expressed proteins to the matrix, we modified the parental plasmid pET16b-CTCF-C to pET16b-CTCF-C+cys by adding a tag composed of four cysteine residues. To this end, the pET16b-CTCF-C plasmid was cut withAgeI and XhoI enzymes, and the backbone was then re-ligated with the double stranded annealed DNA fragment 5′-CCGG-T GT-TGC-TGT-TGC-TAG-CTA-AC-3′ encoding the tag created by the four-cysteine amino acids (underlined) in-frame with the end of the CTCF protein, followed by the stop codon and flanked by the AgeI andXhoI (shown in bold italic) sites for cloning into pET16b-CTCF-C digested with AgeI plus XhoI. The resulting plasmid was named pET16b-CTCF-C+cys, and its vector backbone obtained after digestion with NdeI and AgeI enzymes was utilized to produce the pET16b-CTCF-N+cys and p16b-CTCF-Zn+cys vectors for expression of the CTCF amino-terminal and zinc finger domains, respectively (see Fig. 4 A). The corresponding domains were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the pCI7.1 vector (6Filippova G. Fagerlie S. Klenova E. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P. Collins S. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) with primers containing a NdeI restriction site in-frame with the pET16b translation start codon andAgeI at the stop site. The primers were (NdeI andAgeI sites are underlined): 1) for theCTCF amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–278) (see Fig.4 A), the forward primer (NdeI, nucleotides 279–300, numbering according to ref. 6Filippova G. Fagerlie S. Klenova E. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P. Collins S. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), 5′-AGAGGCAGGGCATATGGAAGGT-3′, and the reverse primer (AgeI, nucleotides 1125–1105), 5′-ACGCCGTGGACACCGGTAACT-3′; or for the CTCF zinc finger domain (amino acids 264–584) (see Fig. 4 A), the forward primer (NdeI) (nucleotides 1081–1104), 5′-AAGACATTCCAGCATATGCTTTGC-3′ with the reverse primer (AgeI) (nucleotides 2043–2023), 5′-CTCTACGCCATACCGGTCAGC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction-produced DNA fragments, corresponding to the amino- and Zn- domains of CTCF, were then cut with NdeI and AgeI and ligated into the pET16b-CTCF-C+cys vector digested withNdeI and AgeI so that the four Cys residues remained in the backbone of the vector. The resulting plasmids, pCTCF-ZF+cys and pCTCF-N+cys, were verified by sequencing and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Transformants carrying the plasmids expressing the three CTCF distinct regions, were grown in LB media supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside with further incubation for 3 h at 37 °C. For purification of each of the desired protein, the bacterial cells were pelleted, washed twice with 0.1 volume of cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis in 0.1 volume of the original culture in the cold fresh lysis buffer containing 8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The lysates were subjected to immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography for further purification. Total bacterial lysates containing His-tag expressed proteins were 1) supplemented with 20 mm imidazole; 2) loaded onto the nickel-charged His-Bind resin (R&D Systems, Europe Ltd.); 3) washed with one bed volume of the washing buffer containing 8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mm imidazole; 4) finally, the His-tagged proteins were eluted by10 ml of the buffer with 8 m urea, 0.1m NaH2PO4, 0.01 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 m imidazole. Purity and identity of the isolated proteins were verified by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot assays with anti-His-tag (H-3) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cystamine-coupled Sepharose 4B was utilized to bind the bacterially produced distinct CTCF domains shown below in Fig.4 A. Cystamine was first converted into aminoethylthiol by a reducing reaction with 50 mm dithiothreitol in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 8.3) for 30 min at room temperature, then treated with 5 mm 2,2-dipyridyldisulfide for 2 h. The activated matrix was washed with the TE buffer. Each protein was reduced by incubation with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature, passed through a G50 column equilibrated with TE to desalt the proteins, and then incubated with the activated matrix overnight at +4 °C at a protein to Sepharose v/w ratio of 5 mg/1 ml. The amounts of the proteins retained on the matrix were monitored by protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein-Sepharose conjugates were finally washed with the TE buffer to remove non-incorporated materials and stored in the buffer containing 20% glycerol, 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.0, and 0.2% Na3N. On a rotating platform, we incubated ∼50 μl of the Sepharose suspension carrying each of different of CTCF protein domains (see Fig. 4 A) mixed with 1 ml of HeLa lysate in 0.25 m RIPA buffer for at least 6 h. Each suspension was then washed six times with 0.25 m RIPA buffer, boiled in SDS sample-loading solution for 5 min, run on 10% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted. The presence of the CTCF-interacting partner, YB-1, was detected with anti-YB1 antibodies. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to procedures described in detail previously (37Plumb M.A. Lobanenkov V.V. Nicolas R.H. Wright C.A. Zavou S. Goodwin G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7675-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A32P-labeled DNA probe (∼1 ng), the chicken c-myc fragment FPV harboring the binding site V for CTCF, was prepared by labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (5Klenova E.

Paterson H. Klenova E. Polotskaja A. Goodwin G. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was incubated in 1× EMSA binding buffer (the 5× EMSA binding buffer stock contained 20% Ficoll, 30 mm NaCl, 100 mmHEPES, pH 7.85, and 1 mm MgCl2) with purified baculoCTCF protein, nuclear extracts prepared from COS6 cells, or with no protein as a control, in the presence of nonspecific double-stranded competitors poly(dI-dC) (200 μg) and poly(dG-dC) (40 μg) in a total volume of 20 μl. This EMSA reaction mixture was kept on ice for 30 min and loaded on the 10% native polyacrylamide gel. The samples were run in 0.33× TBE at 250 V (∼25 mA) for 2 h. The gel was fixed in 10% glacial acetic acid with 20% methanol, dried, and exposed to the XAR-5 film (Kodak). Proteins resolved on the 10% SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to Immobilon P pol"
https://openalex.org/W2039335985,"The MDM2 protein, through its interaction with p53, plays an important role in the regulation of the G1 checkpoint of the cell cycle. In addition to binding to and inhibiting the transcriptional activation function of the p53 protein, MDM2 binds, inter alia, to RB and the E2F-1·DP-1 complex and in so doing may promote progression of cells into S phase. Mice transgenic for Mdm2 possess cells that have cell cycle regulation defects and develop an altered tumor profile independent of their p53 status. MDM2 also blocks the growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor-β1 in a p53-independent manner. We show here that a novel growth regulatory molecule is also the target of MDM2-mediated inhibition. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified a gene that encodes a novel cellular protein (MTBP) that binds to MDM2. MTBP can induce G1 arrest, which in turn can be blocked by MDM2. Our results suggest the existence of another growth control pathway that may be regulated, at least in part, by MDM2. The MDM2 protein, through its interaction with p53, plays an important role in the regulation of the G1 checkpoint of the cell cycle. In addition to binding to and inhibiting the transcriptional activation function of the p53 protein, MDM2 binds, inter alia, to RB and the E2F-1·DP-1 complex and in so doing may promote progression of cells into S phase. Mice transgenic for Mdm2 possess cells that have cell cycle regulation defects and develop an altered tumor profile independent of their p53 status. MDM2 also blocks the growth inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor-β1 in a p53-independent manner. We show here that a novel growth regulatory molecule is also the target of MDM2-mediated inhibition. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified a gene that encodes a novel cellular protein (MTBP) that binds to MDM2. MTBP can induce G1 arrest, which in turn can be blocked by MDM2. Our results suggest the existence of another growth control pathway that may be regulated, at least in part, by MDM2.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). Mdm2 was originally discovered as an oncogene that was amplified on mouse double minute chromosomes (11Cahilly-Snyder L. Yang-Feng T. Francke U. George D.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar,12Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Mdm2 was later found to be amplified and overexpressed in a variety of human cancers (5Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar, 13Ladanyi M. Cha C. Lewis R. Jhanwar S.C. Huvos A.G. Healey J.H. Cancer Res. 1993; 1: 16-18Google Scholar, 14Reifenberger G. Liu L. Ichimura K. Schmidt E.E. Collins V.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2736-2739PubMed Google Scholar). MDM2 binds to the transcriptional activation domain of p53 and thus inhibits this function of p53 (15Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 16Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Moreover, MDM2 binding to p53 regulates the stability of the p53 protein such that p53 is ubiquitinated and is then degraded by the proteasome (17Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar). This, together with the observed effect on p53 function, has led to a model in which an autoregulatory loop connects MDM2 and p53 (6Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 8Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). MDM2 inhibits both p53-mediated G1 arrest and apoptosis (17Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 19Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). p53 induces G1 arrest by promoting transcriptional up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 (20Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that MDM2 prevents p53 from inducing G1 arrest by inhibiting p53-dependent transcriptional activation. MDM2 can prevent p53-mediated apoptosis, and this has been shown to be dependent on the ability of MDM2 to inhibit transcriptional repression by p53 (21Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S. O'Connor D.J. Mittnacht S. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, a previously identified interaction with RB (22Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) was shown to be able to regulate this effect. By binding to MDM2, RB forms a stable ternary complex with p53, and this prevents the MDM2-promoted degradation of p53. The ternary complex can promote p53-dependent apoptosis, but not p53-mediated transactivation. The autoregulatory relationship between p53 and MDM2 suggests that MDM2 overexpression may be oncogenic because of the resulting inactivation of p53 (8Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by studies of human tumors that show that, in the majority of cases, either p53 is mutated/deleted or MDM2 is overexpressed (23Leach F.S. Tokino T. Meltzer P. Burrell M. Oliner J.D. Smith S. Hill D.E. Sidransky D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2231-2234PubMed Google Scholar). That a primary function ofMdm2 is indeed its ability to negatively regulatep53 is further supported by studies of allelic knockouts of these genes in mice. Mice that possess a homozygous deletion ofMdm2 die at around day 5 of embryogenesis, whereas mice that possess a homozygous deletion of both Mdm2 andp53 are viable and develop normally (24Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 25Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). No differences have been detected between thesep53 −/− andp53 −/−,Mdm2 −/− mice in terms of the rate or spectrum of tumors developed (26Jones S.N. Sands A.T. Hancock A.R. Vogel H. Donehower L.A. Linke S.P. Wahl G.M. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Also, no differences could be detected between the embryonic fibroblasts derived from these animals in terms of their growth or cell cycle characteristics. Collectively, these observations might suggest that the only function of Mdm2 is to regulate p53 activity, and perhaps during normal development, this is indeed the case. However, the situation appears to be different when MDM2 is expressed at abnormally high levels. Experiments in which MDM2 was overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells have shown that naturally occurring splice variants of MDM2 that lack the ability to bind to p53 are still able to transform these cells (27Sigalas I. Calvert A.H. Anderson J.J. Neal D.E. Lunec J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Further support for the idea that MDM2 has p53-independent effects derives from studies of transgenic mice. Mice transgenic for anMdm2 gene expressed from a β-lactoglobulin promoter exhibited abnormal mammary development, with cells becoming polyploid together with a multinucleate morphology, suggestive of DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis (28Lundgren K. Montes de Oca Luna R. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained in both wild-type p53 animals and animals with a homozygous deletion of p53. In addition, recent studies using a different transgenic system with multiple copies of the whole Mdm2gene being used to generate mice that overexpress MDM2 from theMdm2 promoter have shown that these animals develop a different spectrum of tumors, cf. p53 null mice (29Jones S.N. Hancock A.R. Vogel H. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15608-15612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The same effect of MDM2 overexpression was observed regardless of the p53 status of these animals. Finally, in support of the existence of p53-independent effects of MDM2 upon overexpression, it has recently been shown that Mdm2 has the ability to abrogate the growth inhibitory activities of transforming growth factor-β1. This effect was p53-independent in cells in culture (30Sun P. Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results all suggest that overexpression of MDM2 acts not only upon p53, but also on additional pathways. Since the mechanism(s) by which MDM2 exerts these p53-independent effects have not yet been elucidated, we have tried to identify novel MDM2-binding proteins that could help us to understand how MDM2 overexpression alters cell growth regulation. Using MDM2 as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified several novel MDM2-binding proteins. Further screening of these enabled us to focus on one novel gene that encodes a protein that we have called MTBP forMDM2 (two)-bindingprotein. Our results show that MTBP is capable of negatively regulating growth by inducing G1 arrest in a p53-independent manner and, moreover, that this can be suppressed by MDM2. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). H1299 (ATCC CRL-5803), U2OS (ATCC HTB-96), and Saos-2 (ATCC HTB-85) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. pGal4-DBD-MDM2 encodes full-length mouse MDM2 cloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD)1 of pGBT9 (CLONTECH). pGal4-AD-3′-MTBP contains the carboxyl-terminal 380 amino acids of MTBP cloned into theXhoI site of pACT (CLONTECH). pBBV was generated by inserting an oligonucleotide containing the black beetle virus ribosome binding sequences from pBD7 (31Dasmahapatra B. Rozhon E.J. Schwartz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) into theHindIII and EcoRV sites of pcDNA1-Neo (Invitrogen). pSK-BBV was generated by subcloning aHindIII/BglII DNA fragment containing the black beetle virus ribosome binding sequence from pBBV into theHindIII and BamHI sites of plasmid pBluescript SK II+ (Stratagene). Clones identified as encoding candidate MDM2-interacting molecules in the yeast two-hybrid screen analysis were amplified from pACT with GAD5 (5′-gag aga gat atc gcc aat ttt aat caa agt ggg aat att-3′) and GAD3 (5′-gag aga gcg gcc gct ttc agt atc tac gat tca tag atc tc-3′) primers and subcloned into the EcoRV and NotI sites of pBBV. pBBV-3′-MTBP was constructed by subcloning this polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment from pGal4-AD-3′-MTBP into pBBV. The pSK-MTBP construct used for in vitro translation of full-length MTBP was made by subcloning theNotI fragment from pCEP-MTBP (see below) into theNotI site of pSK-BBV. Recombinant His6-tagged MDM2 (pQE32-MDM2) was generated by cloning anEcoRV/XhoI fragment from pBBV-MDM2 encoding the full-length murine MDM2 cDNA into the SmaI site of pQE32 (QIAGEN Inc.). Recombinant His6-tagged Δ166 (pQE31-Δ166-MDM2) contains a DNA fragment of murine MDM2 lacking the first 166 amino acid residues. The fragment was amplified from pCMVNeoBam-MDM2 by polymerase chain reaction with primers MDM2-PstI (5′-gag aga ctg cag gag aac aca gat gag cta cct gg-3′) and MDM2-HindIII (5′-gag aga aag ct gtc agc tag ttg aag taa ctt agc a-3′) using rTth-XL polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and cloned into the PstI and HindIII sites of pQE31 (QIAGEN Inc.). pCMV (pCMVNeoBam) and pMDM2 (pCMVNeoBam-MDM2) were kindly supplied by Dr. B. Vogelstein (5Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar), and pCMVNeoBam-CD20 was kindly provided by Dr. E. Harlow (32van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). MTBP (pCEP-MTBP-HA) contains full-length murine cDNA for MTBP excised from the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (see below) and cloned into the NotI site of pCEP (Invitrogen). p53 contains full-length human p53 cloned into the pCEP vector. The anti-p53 antibody Ab-1 (PAb421), the anti-MDM2 antibody Ab-1 used for Western blotting (IF2), and the anti-β-galactosidase antibody Ab-1 (200-193) were purchased from Oncogene Research Products. The anti-MDM2 antibody used for immunoprecipitation (SMP14) and the antibody used to detect p21Waf1/Cip1 (F-5) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and the anti-hemagglutinin A (HA) antibodies used to detect HA-tagged MTBP (12CA5 and 16B12) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and BAbCO, respectively. The anti-CD20 antibody leu16 was purchased from Becton Dickinson, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Pierce. We utilized the MatchmakerTM system (CLONTECH) to screen a mouse T-cell lymphoma library (ML4001AE) and to assess interactions between the Gal4-DBD-MTBP and Gal4-AD-MDM2 deletion mutants. MDM2 deletion mutants were prepared as described (52Vlatkovic N. Guerrera S. Li Y. Linn S. Haines D.S. Boyd M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 18: 3581-3586Crossref Google Scholar). We used the Marathon RACETM system (CLONTECH) to amplify the 5′- and 3′-ends of MTBP from a murine B-cell cDNA. Briefly, total cellular RNA was prepared from murine SP2 cells (ATCC CRL-1646) using RNAzolTM (MBI), and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from this using OligotexTM beads (QIAGEN Inc.). 5′-RACE was performed using the gene-specific oligonucleotides GSP-1 (5′-tga aga ata agg ttc aac tgt acc-3′) and GSP-2 (5′-cag ctt tca cgg tgt ctg ttt g-3′). Polymerase chain reaction was performed with rTth-XL polymerase, and the products were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). 3′-RACE was also performed and confirmed the termination codon identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Sequencing was performed using dye terminators and an ABI Model 373 sequencer. Homology to Boi1p and Boi2p was identified using the FASTA program to examine theSaccharomyces cerevisiae data base at Stanford University. The full-length cDNA for MTBP was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification with the oligonucleotides MTBP-5′-NotI (5′-gag aga gcg gcc gcg gcg cga aga gga tgg atc ggt act tgc tg-3′) and MTBP-3′-HA-NotI (5′-gag aga gcg gcc gcc tac agg gag gcg taa tcg ggc aca tcg tag ggg tat ttc ttg ctc atc ttt tct acc acc-3′) using rTth-XL polymerase, and the product was cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen). For in vitrobinding assays, MDM2 and Δ166-MDM2 were expressed in XL-1 bacteria (Stratagene) from the pQE32-MDM2 and pQE31-Δ166-MDM2 constructs, respectively; captured on Ni2+-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.); and washed with buffers B–D as described by the manufacturer. Prior to all binding reactions, protein captured on beads was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by both Western blotting and staining with Coomassie Blue. 100 μl of washed beads were then mixed with 10 μl of in vitro translated protein (TNT, Promega) for 3 h at 30 °C, followed by washing three times with Dignam buffer D (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) supplemented with 75 mm imidazole. Beads were then resuspended in loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography using AmplifyTM(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were transfected either by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or using FUGENE-6TM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were typically transfected with 10 μg of each plasmid, and proteins were extracted 48–72 h post-transfection. Transfected cells were harvested, and the cell pellet was lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1–2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1–2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, and the concentration of total proteins was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Between 1 and 5 mg of protein were then precleared by incubation with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was incubated with 1 μg of primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer; resuspended in 30 μl of protein sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mdithiothreitol); and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following incubation with primary antibodies and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with RenaissanceTM (NEN Life Science Products). Saos-2 and U2OS cells were transfected using FUGENE-6 with the indicated plasmids. Cells were harvested and analyzed by FACS essentially as described (19Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Briefly, nocodazole was added to the indicated cells at 50 ng/ml for 12 h prior to harvesting. Cells were harvested 48–72 h after the addition of FUGENE-6·DNA complexes and washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. CD20-positive cells were detected using anti-CD20 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Cells were fixed in ethanol and then stained with propidium iodide. Cells were analyzed using a FACScanTM (Becton Dickinson) and LYSIS-II software. H1299 cells were transfected using either the calcium phosphate precipitation method or FUGENE-6. Typically for the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure, 24 h after removal of precipitates, hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. Cells were maintained under selective conditions for 72 h, washed, and refed with hygromycin-free complete medium. Nocodazole (Sigma) was added as indicated at a concentration of 20 ng/ml, 16 h before cells were harvested for analysis. For colony formation assays, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids; and 24–48 h after the addition of DNA, hygromycin B was added at to final concentration of 200 μg/ml. Cells were refed every 3 days with medium containing hygromycin B until colonies were visible. For some experiments, cells were stained with Giemsa. We have used a yeast two-hybrid screen (35Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar) to identify potential MDM2-binding proteins that might directly interact with MDM2 to mediate its p53-independent effects. Full-length cDNA for murine MDM2 was subcloned into a Gal4-DBD yeast expression construct and used to screen a murine T-cell lymphoma cDNA library. Fig.1 A shows that a carboxyl-terminal cDNA from a novel gene fused to the activation domain of Gal4 (Gal4-AD-3′-MTBP) interacted with Gal4-DBD-MDM2, but not with Gal4-DBD. To confirm this interaction in a different system, thein vitro translated cDNA from the yeast two-hybrid screen (pBBV-3′-MTBP) was mixed with recombinant His6-tagged MDM2. Fig. 1 B shows that pBBV-3′-MTBP encoded a peptide that can bind in vitro to MDM2. Sequence analysis of this cDNA demonstrated that it is a novel sequence that encodes a predicted peptide of 380 amino acids. Northern analysis demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal cDNA hybridized to an mRNA of ∼3 kilobases (Fig.2 A and data not shown). We therefore cloned the rest of the cDNA for this gene using a RACE-based strategy. Analysis of 5′-RACE products from mRNA obtained from a murine B-cell line demonstrated that several clones possessed an authentic 5′-end; they were identical and terminated upstream of a single long open reading frame that was in frame with the clone identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen. The sequence of this clone has been deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (AJ278508). This cDNA encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 104 kDa, and we have given this gene the nameMtbp (MDM2 (two)-binding protein). Data base analysis detected two yeast genes whose protein products possessed significant homology to MTBP: BOI1 andBOI2 (36Bender L. Lo H.S. Lee H. Kokojan V. Peterson V. Bender A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 879-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Matsui Y. Matsui R. Akada R. Toh-e A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 865-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The two proteins encoded by these genes (Boi1p and Boi2p, respectively) exhibit an overall amino acid identity of 38%, but this is concentrated into four regions (I–IV) that possess identities of 71, 65, 78, and 69%, respectively. Both Boi1p and Boi2p inhibit growth in yeast when expressed at high levels. The homology between Boi1p and MTBP and between Boi2p and MTBP is 21.2 and 21% amino acid identities in alignments of 401 and 400 amino acids, respectively, and is entirely contained within the carboxyl-terminal regions of all three proteins. Fig. 1 Cshows the FASTA-generated alignment of Boi2p and MTBP. Domain 3 of Boi2p is a proline-rich area that is essential for binding to the second SH3 region of Bem1p. The corresponding region of MTBP is also proline-rich. It is noteworthy that the growth inhibitory function of Boi2p is entirely contained within the carboxyl-terminal moiety of the protein. Apart from expressed sequence tags, no other substantial homologies to MTBP could be identified.Figure 2MTBP is expressed in a variety of tissues, and full-length MTBP binds to MDM2 in vitro and in transfected mammalian cells. A, shown are the results from Northern analysis of MTBP expression. The blot was exposed for 4 days at −70 °C. Longer exposures demonstrated low level expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and slightly higher levels in colon and prostate tissues. B, an in vitro binding assay was performed using full-length MTBP. The full-length protein bound to murine MDM2 and not to the XL-1 negative control. IVT indicates 10% of the in vitro translated input for binding. C, shown are the results from immunoprecipitation and Western analysis of H1299 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids. Cells were harvested 48–72 h after removal of precipitates and feeding, followed by immunoprecipitation with an MDM2-specific antibody (SMP14), an HA-specific antibody to detect MTBP (16B12), or an isotype-matched control antibody. Western analysis of the immunoprecipitates was performed with either an MDM2-specific antibody (Ab-1), an HA-specific antibody to detect MTBP (12CA5), or an anti-mouse IgG-specific serum to determine the relative efficiency of the immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The full-length cDNA for MTBP was then used to examine the pattern of expression of this gene by Northern blotting. Fig. 2 Ashows that MTBP was expressed in a variety of normal tissues, with the highest levels of expression in the thymus, testis, and ovary and with low or almost undetectable expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes. We also found MTBP expression in the pancreas, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and liver and relatively low expression in the brain (data not shown). To test whether the interaction we had detected between the carboxyl-terminal region of MTBP and MDM2 also occurred with the full-length form of the protein, we performed an in vitrobinding assay using recombinant His6-MDM2 and in vitro translated MTBP as shown in Fig. 2 B. Further confirmation of the interaction between these two proteins came from our analysis of mammalian cells transfected with MDM2 and a carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged form of MTBP. Immunoprecipitation with either an anti-HA or anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody, followed by Western blot analysis, demonstrated that the two proteins could be coprecipitated as shown in Fig. 2 C. These results suggest that a novel protein (MTBP) can bind specifically to MDM2 under these conditions. The MDM2 protein has a number of highly conserved regions, and the function of these is not fully understood (reviewed in Ref.38Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J. Cell Mol.

To determine the region of MDM2 that binds to MTBP, we used a series of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of Gal4-DBD-MDM2 and tested them for the ability to interact in yeast with Gal4-AD-MTBP. Fig. 3 A shows that the interaction could be detected with all mutants that contain the amino-terminal 304 amino acids of MDM2, but not with shorter mutants. It is important to mention here that the p53-containing construct Gal4-AD-p53 interacts with the above mutants and in addition with mutants 1–199 and 1–166 (data not shown), which suggests that the failure of MTBP to bind to these mutants of MDM2 does not merely reflect lower expression or other conformational problems. We also tested the ability of in vitro translated full-length MTBP and carboxyl-terminal MTBP (pBBV-3′-MTBP) to bind to both full-length MDM2 and a mutant that lacks the first 166 amino acids (Δ166). Δ166 did not bind to p53 (data not shown), but as shown in Fig. 3 B, bound to both full-length MTBP and pBBV-3′-MTBP. Taken together, these results suggest that a region of MDM2 bounded by amino acids 167–304 is sufficient to bind to MTBP and that an essential minimal region is bounded by amino acids 200–304 inclusive. As illustrated in Fig. 3 C, this portion of MDM2 contains a nuclear localization signal, a motif identified as a nuclear export signal, and an acidic region. Our results in both yeast (Fig.3 A) and in vitro (Fig. 3 B, left panel) suggest that the carboxyl-terminal portion of MTBP (amino acids 515–894) is sufficient for binding to MDM2. We conclude that MDM2 binds to the carboxyl-terminal 380 amino acids of MTBP and that an area of MDM2 bounded by amino acids 167–304 is sufficient for the binding interaction to occur. Several MDM2-binding proteins are regulators of cell growth; and indeed, both of the MTBP partial homologs (Boi1p and Boi2p) have been shown to have growth inhibitory activity (36Bender L. Lo H.S.

Disruption of the E2 gene is commonly associated with malignancy in cervical carcinoma, indicating that E2 has a role in regulating tumor progression. Although the E2 proteins from all characterized papillomaviruses bind specifically to the same 12-base pair DNA sequence, the cancer-associated human papillomavirus E2 proteins display a unique ability to detect DNA flexibility and intrinsic curvature. To understand the structural basis for this phenomenon, we have determined the crystal structures of the human papillomavirus-18 E2 DNA-binding domain and its complexes with high and low affinity binding sites. The E2 protein is a dimeric β-barrel and the E2-DNA interaction is accompanied by a large deformation of the DNA as it conforms to the E2 surface. DNA conformation and E2-DNA contacts are similar in both high and low affinity complexes. The differences in affinity correlate with the flexibility of the DNA sequence. Preferences of E2 proteins from different papillomavirus strains for flexible or prebent DNA targets correlate with the distribution of positive charge on their DNA interaction surfaces, suggesting a role for electrostatic forces in the recognition of DNA deformability.

E2 binding site human papillomavirus bovine papillomavirus dithiothreitol Networks of hydrogen bonds between amino acid side chains and the functional groups of DNA bases are a well documented mechanism of DNA sequence recognition by proteins. Not as well understood is the stereochemical and energetic basis by which protein-DNA binding affinity is modulated when all of these direct components of interaction are conserved. Biologically, such discriminatory abilities are essential when DNA-binding proteins have to select between multiple binding sites present among a vast excess of nonspecific DNA. This is the case in the papillomaviruses, where the primary transcriptional regulatory protein, E2, is confronted by numerous binding sites on the viral genome (Fig. 1 a). These sites must be occupied in a defined order such that transcription and viral DNA replication proceed in a regulated fashion (1Steger G. Corbach S. J.

The 7857-base pair circular genome consists of two regions coding for early (E) and late (L) genes. An 800-base pair noncoding region is present upstream of the E6 gene and is called the long control region (LCR). The major early promoter (P105) and a differentiation-specific promoter are indicated by arrows. The long control region contains both transcriptional regulatory elements and the origin of replication. A region of the long control region (of HPV strains −18, −16, −11, and −31) that contains the four E2 binding sites (E2BS1–4) is detailedbelow. In each case, the spacer sequence is shown inblue. The inset is the consensus DNA-binding site of the E2 proteins and the sequences of the two binding-sites referred to as E2BS(AATT) and E2BS(ACGT). The identity elements are inred, and the preferred nucleotides are in green. b, amino acid sequence alignments of the HPV-18, HPV-16, and BPV-1 E2 DNA-binding domains. Identical residues are in red, and similar residues are in green. The residue numbering for HPV-18 E2 and BPV-1 E2 are shown as is the secondary structure of HPV-18 E2/D.

The E2 protein has the same functions in the over 100 characterized papillomavirus strains: to activate or repress transcription in a context-dependent fashion and to facilitate the initiation of viral DNA replication via interactions with the viral replication protein E1. Differences in the details of transcription and replication control have been documented between the viral strains that infect different host tissues and between the papillomavirus strains that are associated with different conditions in humans such as warts or cervical cancer (2Garrido-Guerrero E.

The E2 proteins from all viral strains have in common the fact that they bind a palindromic DNA sequence ACCgNNNNcGGT, referred to as the E2 binding site (E2BS;1 lowercase letters indicate preferred nucleotides, and the NNNN region is called the “spacer”). However, there exist virus strain-specific differences in the abilities of various E2 proteins to discriminate between binding sites. The E2 proteins from the human papillomavirus (HPV) strains that infect mucosa (including the cancer-associated strains HPV-18 and HPV-16 and the wart-causing strain HPV-11) bind with significantly greater affinity to E2BS with spacers rich in AT base pairs (1Steger G.

On the other hand, the E2 protein from bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) displays no distinctive spacer sequence preference (12Hines C.S. Meghoo C. Shetty S. Biburger M. Brenowitz M. Hegde R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The viral genomes reflect these trends; the mucosal HPV genomes have E2 binding sites with AT-rich spacers (Fig.1 a), while the genomes of the nonprimate animal viruses (including BPV-1) have no such predominance of AT-rich spacer-containing binding sites (13Li R. Knight J. Bream G. Stenlund A. Botchan M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 510-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the E2 DNA-binding domain from strains BPV-1 (14Hegde R.S.

Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, there is no structural information yet on a DNA complex of any HPV E2 protein. Here we report the crystal structures of the E2 DNA-binding domain (E2/D) from human papillomavirus type 18 and its complexes with high and low affinity binding sites. The HPV-18 E2-DNA interaction uses an induced-fit mechanism, with a large deformation of DNA and only modest local rearrangements of the protein. Comparisons of the various E2/D structures reveal an unexpected similarity between the quaternary structures of the HPV-18 and BPV-1 E2/D proteins as compared with those of the more closely related (in sequence, evolutionary distance of viral strain, and pathology) HPV-16 and HPV-31 E2/D proteins. HPV-18 E2/D binds with very different affinities to the two E2BS sequences used in the crystallographic studies, yet no base sequence-specifying protein-DNA contacts differ in the two complexes. Like the related HPV-16 E2/D protein, but in contrast to BPV-1 E2/D, HPV-18 E2/D recognizes and discriminates against conformational flexibility in DNA. There exists a correlation between the distribution of positive charge on the DNA interaction surfaces of these proteins and their preferences for prebent or flexible DNA targets. His-tagged HPV-18 E2/D (amino acids 286–365 and N-terminal residues GSHM that arose from the cloning procedure) was obtained by overexpression in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The His-tagged protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The His tag was removed by thrombin treatment, and the cleaved protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography (Fast-S; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), resulting in pure protein as determined by silver-stained SDS gels. BPV-1 E2/D was purified as described previously (17Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were obtained from the Yale Keck Biotechnology Facility and purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono-Q; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (17Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). All of the crystals were grown by vapor diffusion from hanging drops at room temperature. 5 mg ml−1 of HPV-18 E2/D in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT was mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 2.7 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 4.7. Crystals of dimensions 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.15 mm appeared in 3–5 days. Diffraction data were recorded on a RAXIS II image plate detector from a crystal maintained at −170 °C. An equimolar mixture of HPV-18 E2/D and E2BS(AATT) was made in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT. Drops were made by mixing 10 mg ml−1 complex with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 47% 2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7, 20 mmCaCl2. Platelike crystals of dimensions 0.4 × 0.25 × 0.05 mm appeared in 5–7 days. Diffraction data were recorded on a RAXIS II image plate detector from a crystal maintained at −170 °C. An equimolar mixture of HPV-18 E2/D and E2BS(ACGT) was made in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT. Drops containing equal volumes of the protein-DNA complex and a well solution containing 48% 2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.7, 20 mm CaCl2 were made. Very thin platelike crystals (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.02 mm) appeared in 5–7 days. Diffraction data were recorded at Brookhaven beam X4A on a CCD detector from a crystal maintained at −170 °C. An equimolar mixture of BPV-1 E2/D and an annealed oligonucleotide of sequence CCAACCGAATTCGGTTG was made in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT. Drops were made with 6.25 mg ml−1 of the complex and an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 30% PEG3350, 47 mm MES, pH 6.2, 2 mm CaCl2. Rod-shaped crystals of dimensions 0.15 × 0.1 × 0.08 mm appeared in 5–7 days. Diffraction data were recorded on a RAXIS II image plate detector from a crystal maintained at −170 °C. All images were indexed; the reflections were integrated, scaled, and postrefined with the HKL package (programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar)); and the structures were determined by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). A model of BPV-1 E2/D-E2BS(ACGT) (17Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) was used to find a Molecular Replacement solution for the BPV-1 E2/D-E2BS(AATT) structure. Using data from 15–3.5 Å, the correct solution had a correlation coefficient of 0.25. A polyalanine model constructed from the refined structure of the BPV-1 E2/D-E2BS(AATT) complex was used in Molecular Replacement to determine the structure of the HPV-18 E2/D-E2BS(AATT) complex. Using data from 15–4.8 Å, the correct solution had a correlation coefficient of 0.491. A model consisting of one subunit of HPV-18 E2/D was constructed from the HPV-18 E2/D-E2BS(AATT) complex structure and used to obtain a Molecular Replacement solution for the HPV-18 E2/D structure. Using data between 15 and 4.5 Å, the correct solution had a correlation coefficient of 0.507. Using the refined structure of the E2BS(AATT) complex as a model, rigid body refinement was conducted on the HPV-18 E2/D-E2BS(ACGT) complex data. Using difference maps, the correct oligonucleotide sequence was modeled. All structures (except the HPV-18 E2/D-E2BS(ACGT) complex) were refined using a combination of simulated annealing, bulk solvent correction, positional refinement, and restrained individual B-factor refinement in CNS (20Brunger A. CNS , version 0.9. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Simulated annealing omit maps were systematically calculated and examined to minimize the effects of model bias. Only restrained grouped B-factors were refined for the HPV-18 E2/D-E2BS(ACGT) structure. The final model of HPV-18 E2/D-E2BS(AATT) includes residues 287–323 and 329–364 (residues 309–312 had weak electron density, and some of these side chains were modeled as Ala). No unambiguous density corresponding to the C-terminal residue (Met365) was present, and it is not included in the refined model. In three out of four subunits that comprise the asymmetric unit, the final model of HPV-18 E2/D includes residues 287–322 and 329–365 (residues 308–312 had weak electron density, and these side chains were modeled as Ala). One subunit had clear density corresponding to residues 323–328, which are included in the model. Since crystal packing influences this region, the loop conformation is not included in any discussions. The final model of HPV-18 E2/D-E2BS(ACGT) includes residues 287–323 and 328–364 (residues 310–312 had weak electron density, and some of these side chains were modeled as Ala). No unambiguous density corresponding to the C-terminal residue (Met365) was present, and it is not included in the refined model. The final model of BPV-1 E2/D-E2BS(AATT) includes residues 326–410. There are two complexes in the asymmetric unit. In one complex, one 5′-overhanging C is flipped out packing against the protein surface, and no density corresponding to the other 5′-C is present. In the other complex, the C nucleotide at position −8 of one strand is flipped out and packed against the protein surface. The 5′-C then base pairs with G+8 of the other strand. Since the DNA conformation at the 5′- and 3′-ends are clearly affected by crystal packing, all analyses of DNA conformation in the discussions are restricted to the central 14 base pairs that include the E2BS. For all structures, the final model had all non-Gly residues in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.

This strategy allowed the introduction of breaks in the phosphodiester backbone of the E2 binding site. Oligonucleotides were purified by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, end-labeled, and annealed by heating the probe (2 nm concentration) to 90 °C for 10 min and transferring immediately to ice for 10 min. Quantitative gel mobility shift experiments were conducted following published protocols (21Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol.

The reaction mixtures were incubated in a water bath at 25 °C for 30 min and then loaded onto prerun 12% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE, pH 8.0. The electrophoresis was run at 200 V for ∼90 min.

The equilibrium binding constant, K, was determined by analysis of the titration curves against the coupled equationsθ1=11+K[X]Equation 1 andθ2=K[X]1+K[X]Equation 2 where Θ1 is the DNA fraction unbound, Θ2 is the DNA fraction complexed with protein,K is the equilibrium association constant, and [X] is the free active protein dimer concentration. The DNA binding activity of the HPV-18 E2/D protein preparations was determined from stoichiometric titrations (22Senear D.F. Dalma-Weishaus D. Brenowitz M. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); the values presented are corrected for this activity. Since the γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide concentration is much lower than the equilibrium dissociation constants being measured, the approximation that total protein concentration is equal to free protein concentration is made. The standard state Gibbs free energy of binding was calculated from the equilibrium association constant by ΔG 0 = −RT ln K, where R is the gas constant and T is temperature. Each of the values of ΔG 0 reported were determined by the global analysis of at least two independent titrations. The 1.9-Å crystal structure of HPV-18 E2/D and the 2.4-Å structure of its complex with the high affinity binding site E2BS(AATT) are described in detail below. In order to examine the stereochemistry at a low affinity HPV-18 E2/D-DNA interface, the structure of HPV-18 E2/D bound to E2BS(ACGT) has been determined. While the limited resolution (3 Å) of this crystal structure does not permit detailed analyses, it is of sufficient quality to allow comparisons of global features and direct protein-DNA interactions. To provide a direct comparison between the modes of DNA recognition of the HPV-18 and BPV-1 E2/D proteins, the 2.3-Å structure of BPV-1 E2/D bound to E2BS(AATT) has also been determined. This complex is similar in most respects to the previously reported crystal structure of BPV-1 E2/D bound to E2BS(ACGT) (17Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and only salient features are presented here. In all of the discussions below, comparisons are drawn between the complexes of the HPV-18 or BPV-1 E2/D proteins with the same E2BS sequence, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Each monomer of HPV-18 E2/D folds into an open-faced β-sandwich with a β-α-β-β-α-β topology (Fig. 1 c). One α-helix in each subunit contains all of the amino acid residues involved in half-site recognition and is termed the “recognition helix.” Two E2/D monomers associate such that the β-strands at the edges (β2 and β4) form hydrogen bonds with their symmetry mates (Fig.1 c). This results in a continuous eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. Buried in the interface are numerous large side chains including Thr287, Ile289, His291, Lys293, Trp320, Trp322, Ile332, Thr334, Thr336, Met363, and Met365 (Fig.4 a). The dimerization interface is extensive, occluding 1625 Å2 of surface area. A herring bone type packing of four Trp residues in the dimer interface is common to all of the mucosal HPV E2 proteins (Fig. 4) and is likely to be a major contributor to the stability of the dimer. As a result of the intricate and closely packed dimer interface, any rearrangement of subunits upon DNA binding would entail a significant energetic penalty. There is a cavity at the center of the barrel, and solvent molecules have been modeled into the electron density clearly apparent in this region. Electron density corresponding to the loop between the recognition helix and β2 (residues 308–312) is weak, indicating local disorder in this region. The loop between strands β2 and β3 is disordered. The E2 proteins from different viral strains differ in quaternary structure (Fig.5 a). The HPV-18 and BPV-1 E2/D proteins are alike in the relative orientation of their subunits while differing from the HPV-16 and HPV-31 E2/D proteins. When one subunit of each protein is superimposed, the nonsuperimposed recognition helices of HPV-16 and HPV-18 E2/D are related by an average translation of 7 Å (Fig. 5 a). Functionally, these features of the E2 proteins are critical, since they dictate the spatial arrangement of side chains presented to the major grooves for DNA sequence recognition. The large variation in subunit orientation among the HPV E2/D proteins suggests either that they undergo unique subunit rearrangements upon DNA binding or that DNA is bent very differently in each of the protein-DNA complexes. E2 dimer architecture is governed by two features: first, the alignment of strands β2 and β4 against their symmetry mates (Fig. 5 b) and, second, the packing of side chains in the barrel core (Fig. 4). While the alignment of the β2strands is invariant, E2 proteins from different viral strains differ in the register of their dyad-related β4 strands (Fig.5 b). When one subunit each of the HPV-18 E2/D and HPV-16 E2/D proteins are superimposed, residues Gly361–Thr364 of HPV-18 E2/D align with residues Gly361–Ser364 of HPV-16 E2/D. The nonsuperimposed subunit is out of register by two residues; Tyr362–Met365 of HPV-18 E2/D lines up with Thr360–Met363 of HPV-16 E2/D. As a result, while the Phe362 residues of HPV-16 E2/D straddle a 2-fold axis, the corresponding Tyr362 residues in HPV-18 E2/D are not symmetrically disposed about a 2-fold axis. In this regard, HPV-18 E2/D resembles BPV-1 E2/D, while the HPV-16 and HPV-31 E2/D proteins are similar to each other (23Liang H. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Yoon H.S. Egan D.A. Walter K. Holzman T.F. Robins T. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that strand register is specified by cross-strand side chain interactions (24Merkel J.S. Sturtevant J.M. Regan L. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 17: 1333-1343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and this is clearly evident in the case of these E2/D proteins. The invariant glycine in the β4 strand of all E2 proteins (Gly361 in HPV-18 E2/D and HPV-16 E2/D and Gly403 in BPV-1 E2/D) has"

The assembly of the pit occurs in a sequential fashion and appears to require the regulated binding of AP-2 to membranes (2Wang L.-H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. J.

When bound to plasma membranes, AP-2 facilitates the polymerization of clathrin triskelions into hexagonal lattices.Binding of AP-2 to the inner membrane surface of fibroblasts has several characteristics (5Mahaffey D.T.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding site behaves like an integral membrane protein that can be removed by protease treatment. The released proteolytic fragment retains the ability to bind AP-2 and block AP-2 binding to isolated plasma membranes. Binding does not depend on calcium and occurs best at neutral pH (5Mahaffey D.T. Peeler J.S. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP-2 binding to the membrane is required but not sufficient for clathrin polymerization (6Peeler J.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Proteins with the characteristics of an AP-2-binding site are the synaptotagmins (7Zhang J.Z.

There are at least 12 different genes in mammals (8Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C.

The best studied member of this family is synaptotagmin I (Syt I).1 The cytoplasmic portion of the molecule contains two C2 domains (11Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Both domains bind Ca2+. The first C2 domain (C2A) of synaptotagmin binds phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This domain also interacts with syntaxin (8Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 12Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the second C2domain (C2B) contains the high affinity, Ca2+-independent binding site for AP-2. C2B also binds polyinositolphosphates (13Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SNAP-25 (14Schiavo G.

Mice deficient in synaptotagmin I are defective in Ca2+ dependent, fast synchronous release of neurotransmitters (20Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), which suggests that synaptotagmin I plays a role in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Microinjected synprint peptides block synaptic transmission (21Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Baker C. Kobayashi H. Catterall W.A.

Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10703-10707Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). On the other hand, functional disruption of the synaptotagmin gene in Caenorhabditis elegans causes a marked depletion of synaptic vesicles, which suggests it is involved in endocytosis (24Jorgensen E.M. Hartwieg E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Drosophilalacking synaptotagmin, by contrast, do not exhibit the same dramatic reduction in synaptic vesicle number (25Reist N.E. Buchanan J. Li J. DiAntonio A. Buxton E.M. Schwarz T.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7662-7673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microinjection of anti-C2B polyclonal IgG into squid axons depletes synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals (26Fukuda M. Moreira J.E.

Biochemical experiments also suggest that the tyrosine-based sequence YXXΦ, which targets receptors to coated pits, enhances AP-2 interaction with synaptotagmin C2B domains (27Haucke V. De Camilli P. Science. 1999; 285: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A synergistic interaction between AP-2, synaptotagmin, and receptors containing YXXΦ motifs could explain why coated pits are dramatically increased in cells overexpressing transferrin receptors (28Iacopetta B.J. Rothenberger S. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 485-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Miller K. Shipman M. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Although AP-2 binds to all synaptotagmins tested so far (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 8Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence that the molecule is involved in coated pit function. The phenotype of the C. elegans synaptotagmin mutants and the loss of synaptic vesicles following antibody injection into squid axons could be indirect effects. We have now tested directly if synaptotagmins participate in endocytosis by searching for forms of the molecule that act as dominant negative inhibitors of endocytosis. Our results show that expression of synaptotagmin lacking the C2B domain markedly inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis and, in parallel, reduces the number of cell surface-coated pits. This effect is totally independent of the precise sequence of the transmembrane region of the synaptotagmin fragment, but depends on two conserved cysteine residues. These results suggest synaptotagmin plays a direct role in coated pit function.DISCUSSIONSeveral studies indicate that membranes in the endocytic pathway contain a regulated binding site for AP-2 (2Wang L.-H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 3Seaman M.N.J. Ball C.L. Robinson M.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). AP-2 binding to membranes is strongly correlated with the formation of clathrin lattices (2Wang L.-H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 3Seaman M.N.J. Ball C.L. Robinson M.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, these binding sites must be the cornerstone of coated pit assembly and function. A program of study focused on identifying these binding site(s) (5Mahaffey D.T. Peeler J.S. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Peeler J.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) culminated in the discovery that synaptotagmin I bound AP-2 with high affinity in vitro (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Subsequently we found that AP-2 binding to the C2B domain occurs for all the synaptotagmins we tested (8Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar,30Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The results of the current study provides evidence that multimerization of synaptotagmin is linked to endocytosis by coated pits.Synaptotagmins lacking the C2B domain, either alone or in combination with other parts of the cytoplasmic region, behaved like dominant-negative inhibitors of LDL uptake. This result was obtained with both synaptotagmin I and VII. A fragment consisting of as little as the short N-terminal sequence and transmembrane region of synaptotagmin VII was a potent inhibitor of endocytosis. The expression of these fragments also blocked fluorescent transferrin internalization (data not show), which suggests they have a general effect on endocytosis by coated pits. Currently there are only four known ways to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis: remove receptors from the cell surface (48Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar); prevent receptor clustering in coated pits (49Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 53Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 108: 389-400Crossref Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 54Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our data characterize a fifth mechanism to inhibit endocytosis, namely overexpression of the N-terminal sequence of synaptotagmin.The reduction in coated pits seen in cells expressing the short N-terminal fragment of synaptotagmin VII suggests that the primary defect is clathrin lattice assembly. The reduced number of coated pits in cells permanently transfected with this synaptotagmin fragment (56% of normal) correlated with the inhibition of LDL uptake (∼40% of normal) in these cells. Presumably we did not see 100% inhibition because not every cell expressed inhibitory levels of the synaptotagmin fragment. In transient transfection assays, cells expressing this fragment had clustered receptors in the remaining coated pits (Fig. 6). We do not know, however, if the cells with clustered receptors expressed enough of the truncated protein to inhibit LDL uptake. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that, in addition to inhibiting coated pit assembly, the short synaptotagmin VII fragment causes the assembly of pits that look normal but are unable to complete the internalization process.We identified two requirements for the inhibitory activity of truncated synaptotagmin: the absence of the C2B domain and the cysteine residues at positions 38 and 41. Expression of wild-type molecules had no effect on endocytosis, nor did the transmembrane domain of the mutant fragment, so inhibition cannot be attributed to the nonspecific effects of overexpressing a transmembrane domain. Synaptotagmin I and synaptotagmin VII have very different extracellular domains so this region of the molecule most likely is not involved either. This leaves an interaction between the transmembrane domain of truncated synaptotagmin and some other molecule(s) in the cell. There might be an unknown molecule required for coated pit internalization that is inactivated by truncated synaptotagmin. Alternatively, the truncated synaptotagmin oligomerizes with endogenous synaptotagmins and prevents their function. We favor the second possibility because synaptotagmins are known to form homomultimers. Previous studies showed that sequences N-terminal to the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin I mediate self-association of synaptotagmin I into large homomultimers in a calcium-independent manner (55Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In addition, the C2B domains of synaptotagmin I and II bind to synaptotagmins in a calcium-dependent manner, resulting in calcium-dependent homomultimerization (18Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol.

We found in co-transfection assays that the synaptotagmin VII fragment lacking the entire cytoplasmic sequence formed stable oligomers with itself and with longer fragments (Fig. 4). Oligomerization was markedly reduced when the cysteine residues in the transmembrane region were replaced with alanine residues (Fig. 4). Furthermore, overexpression of full-length synaptotagmin blocked the inhibition of endocytosis by truncated synaptotagmin VII fragments, suggesting it was sequestering the truncated molecule and preventing its action (Fig. 5). These data suggest that synaptotagmin has a natural tendency to self-associate via interactions involving the transmembrane region, and that these interactions require the two cysteine residues in the transmembrane region.The ability of truncated synaptotagmin VII to reduce the number of coated pits and block LDL uptake suggests synaptotagmin has a direct role in clathrin-coated pit assembly (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The precise molecular interactions required for coated pit assembly have not been determined. Most likely assembly is dependent on a complex set of interactions between AP-2, clathrin, the cytoplasmic portion of transmembrane proteins that cluster in coated pits and membrane lipids (58Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). AP-2 (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and inositol polyphosphates are two key molecules involved in coated pit function that interact with the synaptotagmin C2B domain. Inositol polyphosphates are well known for their ability to modulate interactions between AP-2 and clathrin (59Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and enhance the recognition of YXXΦ sorting signals by AP-2 and AP-1 (60Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). They could also modulate AP-2 binding to synaptotagmins. Therefore, the C2B domain of synaptotagmin appears to be in a critical position to influence several aspects of coated pit assembly and function. The presence of the truncated synaptotagmin in the cell would cause the formation of oligomeric complexes that lack the C2B domain, thereby depleting the complex of binding sites for structural and regulatory molecules critical for coated pit assembly. These conditions might also lead to the assembly of defective pits.Neurons express very high levels of the various synaptotagmins whereas other cells, such as fibroblasts or hepatocytes, appear to have very low levels of these proteins. The relationship between expression level and the role these proteins play in endocytosis is unclear. It is possible that the observed levels of synaptotagmins in non-neuronal cells is sufficient to support coated pit assembly. We also cannot rule out the possibility that an additional, yet to be identified, synaptotagmin expressed in these cells is the critical molecule for coated pit assembly. Alternatively, synaptotagmins may play a regulatory role in coated pit assembly and are only required at high levels in cells like neurons where fast, high throughput synaptic vesicle traffic demands a more rapid and efficient endocytic machinery. Multiple proteins are now known to be involved in coated pit budding, suggesting that the anchoring of the clathrin to the membrane and its subsequent action during invagination is a complex process. Receptor-mediated endocytosis utilizes clathrin-coated pits for efficient uptake of macromolecules from the extracellular space. A surface coated pit is constructed from two components, the clathrin triskelion and the AP-2 complex (1Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The assembly of the pit occurs in a sequential fashion and appears to require the regulated binding of AP-2 to membranes (2Wang L.-H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 3Seaman M.N.J. Ball C.L. Robinson M.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When bound to plasma membranes, AP-2 facilitates the polymerization of clathrin triskelions into hexagonal lattices. Binding of AP-2 to the inner membrane surface of fibroblasts has several characteristics (5Mahaffey D.T. Peeler J.S. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Peeler J.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding site behaves like an integral membrane protein that can be removed by protease treatment. The released proteolytic fragment retains the ability to bind AP-2 and block AP-2 binding to isolated plasma membranes. Binding does not depend on calcium and occurs best at neutral pH (5Mahaffey D.T. Peeler J.S. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP-2 binding to the membrane is required but not sufficient for clathrin polymerization (6Peeler J.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Proteins with the characteristics of an AP-2-binding site are the synaptotagmins (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmins are type I transmembrane proteins. There are at least 12 different genes in mammals (8Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C.

The best studied member of this family is synaptotagmin I (Syt I).1 The cytoplasmic portion of the molecule contains two C2 domains (11Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Both domains bind Ca2+. The first C2 domain (C2A) of synaptotagmin binds phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This domain also interacts with syntaxin (8Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 12Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the second C2domain (C2B) contains the high affinity, Ca2+-independent binding site for AP-2. C2B also binds polyinositolphosphates (13Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SNAP-25 (14Schiavo G.

Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests synaptotagmin has important functions in both exocytosis and endocytosis. Mice deficient in synaptotagmin I are defective in Ca2+ dependent, fast synchronous release of neurotransmitters (20Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar), which suggests that synaptotagmin I plays a role in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Microinjected synprint peptides block synaptic transmission (21Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Baker C. Kobayashi H. Catterall W.A.

Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10703-10707Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). On the other hand, functional disruption of the synaptotagmin gene in Caenorhabditis elegans causes a marked depletion of synaptic vesicles, which suggests it is involved in endocytosis (24Jorgensen E.M. Hartwieg E. Schuske K. Nonet M.L. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 378: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Drosophilalacking synaptotagmin, by contrast, do not exhibit the same dramatic reduction in synaptic vesicle number (25Reist N.E. Buchanan J. Li J. DiAntonio A. Buxton E.M. Schwarz T.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7662-7673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microinjection of anti-C2B polyclonal IgG into squid axons depletes synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals (26Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M. Sugimori M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10708-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments also suggest that the tyrosine-based sequence YXXΦ, which targets receptors to coated pits, enhances AP-2 interaction with synaptotagmin C2B domains (27Haucke V. De Camilli P. Science. 1999; 285: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A synergistic interaction between AP-2, synaptotagmin, and receptors containing YXXΦ motifs could explain why coated pits are dramatically increased in cells overexpressing transferrin receptors (28Iacopetta B.J. Rothenberger S. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 485-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Miller K. Shipman M. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although AP-2 binds to all synaptotagmins tested so far (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 8Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence that the molecule is involved in coated pit function. The phenotype of the C. elegans synaptotagmin mutants and the loss of synaptic vesicles following antibody injection into squid axons could be indirect effects. We have now tested directly if synaptotagmins participate in endocytosis by searching for forms of the molecule that act as dominant negative inhibitors of endocytosis. Our results show that expression of synaptotagmin lacking the C2B domain markedly inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis and, in parallel, reduces the number of cell surface-coated pits. This effect is totally independent of the precise sequence of the transmembrane region of the synaptotagmin fragment, but depends on two conserved cysteine residues. These results suggest synaptotagmin plays a direct role in coated pit function. DISCUSSIONSeveral studies indicate that membranes in the endocytic pathway contain a regulated binding site for AP-2 (2Wang L.-H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 3Seaman M.N.J. Ball C.L. Robinson M.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). AP-2 binding to membranes is strongly correlated with the formation of clathrin lattices (2Wang L.-H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 3Seaman M.N.J. Ball C.L. Robinson M.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1801-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, these binding sites must be the cornerstone of coated pit assembly and function. A program of study focused on identifying these binding site(s) (5Mahaffey D.T. Peeler J.S. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16514-16520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Peeler J.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) culminated in the discovery that synaptotagmin I bound AP-2 with high affinity in vitro (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Subsequently we found that AP-2 binding to the C2B domain occurs for all the synaptotagmins we tested (8Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar,30Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The results of the current study provides evidence that multimerization of synaptotagmin is linked to endocytosis by coated pits.Synaptotagmins lacking the C2B domain, either alone or in combination with other parts of the cytoplasmic region, behaved like dominant-negative inhibitors of LDL uptake. This result was obtained with both synaptotagmin I and VII. A fragment consisting of as little as the short N-terminal sequence and transmembrane region of synaptotagmin VII was a potent inhibitor of endocytosis. The expression of these fragments also blocked fluorescent transferrin internalization (data not show), which suggests they have a general effect on endocytosis by coated pits. Currently there are only four known ways to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis: remove receptors from the cell surface (48Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar); prevent receptor clustering in coated pits (49Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1976; 270: 695-699Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar); arrest membrane fission during coated pit budding (35Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J.

Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 53Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 108: 389-400Crossref Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 54Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our data characterize a fifth mechanism to inhibit endocytosis, namely overexpression of the N-terminal sequence of synaptotagmin.The reduction in coated pits seen in cells expressing the short N-terminal fragment of synaptotagmin VII suggests that the primary defect is clathrin lattice assembly. The reduced number of coated pits in cells permanently transfected with this synaptotagmin fragment (56% of normal) correlated with the inhibition of LDL uptake (∼40% of normal) in these cells. Presumably we did not see 100% inhibition because not every cell expressed inhibitory levels of the synaptotagmin fragment. In transient transfection assays, cells expressing this fragment had clustered receptors in the remaining coated pits (Fig. 6). We do not know, however, if the cells with clustered receptors expressed enough of the truncated protein to inhibit LDL uptake. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that, in addition to inhibiting coated pit assembly, the short synaptotagmin VII fragment causes the assembly of pits that look normal but are unable to complete the internalization process.We identified two requirements for the inhibitory activity of truncated synaptotagmin: the absence of the C2B domain and the cysteine residues at positions 38 and 41. Expression of wild-type molecules had no effect on endocytosis, nor did the transmembrane domain of the mutant fragment, so inhibition cannot be attributed to the nonspecific effects of overexpressing a transmembrane domain. Synaptotagmin I and synaptotagmin VII have very different extracellular domains so this region of the molecule most likely is not involved either. This leaves an interaction between the transmembrane domain of truncated synaptotagmin and some other molecule(s) in the cell. There might be an unknown molecule required for coated pit internalization that is inactivated by truncated synaptotagmin. Alternatively, the truncated synaptotagmin oligomerizes with endogenous synaptotagmins and prevents their function. We favor the second possibility because synaptotagmins are known to form homomultimers. Previous studies showed that sequences N-terminal to the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin I mediate self-association of synaptotagmin I into large homomultimers in a calcium-independent manner (55Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In addition, the C2B domains of synaptotagmin I and II bind to synaptotagmins in a calcium-dependent manner, resulting in calcium-dependent homomultimerization (18Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol.

We found in co-transfection assays that the synaptotagmin VII fragment lacking the entire cytoplasmic sequence formed stable oligomers with itself and with longer fragments (Fig. 4). Oligomerization was markedly reduced when the cysteine residues in the transmembrane region were replaced with alanine residues (Fig. 4). Furthermore, overexpression of full-length synaptotagmin blocked the inhibition of endocytosis by truncated synaptotagmin VII fragments, suggesting it was sequestering the truncated molecule and preventing its action (Fig. 5). These data suggest that synaptotagmin has a natural tendency to self-associate via interactions involving the transmembrane region, and that these interactions require the two cysteine residues in the transmembrane region.The ability of truncated synaptotagmin VII to reduce the number of coated pits and block LDL uptake suggests synaptotagmin has a direct role in clathrin-coated pit assembly (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The precise molecular interactions required for coated pit assembly have not been determined. Most likely assembly is dependent on a complex set of interactions between AP-2, clathrin, the cytoplasmic portion of transmembrane proteins that cluster in coated pits and membrane lipids (58Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). AP-2 (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and inositol polyphosphates are two key molecules involved in coated pit function that interact with the synaptotagmin C2B domain. Inositol polyphosphates are well known for their ability to modulate interactions between AP-2 and clathrin (59Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and enhance the recognition of YXXΦ sorting signals by AP-2 and AP-1 (60Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). They could also modulate AP-2 binding to synaptotagmins. Therefore, the C2B domain of synaptotagmin appears to be in a critical position to influence several aspects of coated pit assembly and function. The presence of the truncated synaptotagmin in the cell would cause the formation of oligomeric complexes that lack the C2B domain, thereby depleting the complex of binding sites for structural and regulatory molecules critical for coated pit assembly. These conditions might also lead to the assembly of defective pits.Neurons express very high levels of the various synaptotagmins whereas other cells, such as fibroblasts or hepatocytes, appear to have very low levels of these proteins. The relationship between expression level and the role these proteins play in endocytosis is unclear. It is possible that the observed levels of synaptotagmins in non-neuronal cells is sufficient to support coated pit assembly.

Olsnes S. Petersen O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our data characterize a fifth mechanism to inhibit endocytosis, namely overexpression of the N-terminal sequence of synaptotagmin. The reduction in coated pits seen in cells expressing the short N-terminal fragment of synaptotagmin VII suggests that the primary defect is clathrin lattice assembly. The reduced number of coated pits in cells permanently transfected with this synaptotagmin fragment (56% of normal) correlated with the inhibition of LDL uptake (∼40% of normal) in these cells. Presumably we did not see 100% inhibition because not every cell expressed inhibitory levels of the synaptotagmin fragment. In transient transfection assays, cells expressing this fragment had clustered receptors in the remaining coated pits (Fig. 6). We do not know, however, if the cells with clustered receptors expressed enough of the truncated protein to inhibit LDL uptake. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that, in addition to inhibiting coated pit assembly, the short synaptotagmin VII fragment causes the assembly of pits that look normal but are unable to complete the internalization process. We identified two requirements for the inhibitory activity of truncated synaptotagmin: the absence of the C2B domain and the cysteine residues at positions 38 and 41. Expression of wild-type molecules had no effect on endocytosis, nor did the transmembrane domain of the mutant fragment, so inhibition cannot be attributed to the nonspecific effects of overexpressing a transmembrane domain. Synaptotagmin I and synaptotagmin VII have very different extracellular domains so this region of the molecule most likely is not involved either. This leaves an interaction between the transmembrane domain of truncated synaptotagmin and some other molecule(s) in the cell. There might be an unknown molecule required for coated pit internalization that is inactivated by truncated synaptotagmin. Alternatively, the truncated synaptotagmin oligomerizes with endogenous synaptotagmins and prevents their function. We favor the second possibility because synaptotagmins are known to form homomultimers. Previous studies showed that sequences N-terminal to the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin I mediate self-association of synaptotagmin I into large homomultimers in a calcium-independent manner (55Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In addition, the C2B domains of synaptotagmin I and II bind to synaptotagmins in a calcium-dependent manner, resulting in calcium-dependent homomultimerization (18Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol.

We found in co-transfection assays that the synaptotagmin VII fragment lacking the entire cytoplasmic sequence formed stable oligomers with itself and with longer fragments (Fig. 4). Oligomerization was markedly reduced when the cysteine residues in the transmembrane region were replaced with alanine residues (Fig. 4). Furthermore, overexpression of full-length synaptotagmin blocked the inhibition of endocytosis by truncated synaptotagmin VII fragments, suggesting it was sequestering the truncated molecule and preventing its action (Fig. 5). These data suggest that synaptotagmin has a natural tendency to self-associate via interactions involving the transmembrane region, and that these interactions require the two cysteine residues in the transmembrane region. The ability of truncated synaptotagmin VII to reduce the number of coated pits and block LDL uptake suggests synaptotagmin has a direct role in clathrin-coated pit assembly (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The precise molecular interactions required for coated pit assembly have not been determined. Most likely assembly is dependent on a complex set of interactions between AP-2, clathrin, the cytoplasmic portion of transmembrane proteins that cluster in coated pits and membrane lipids (58Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). AP-2 (7Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and inositol polyphosphates are two key molecules involved in coated pit function that interact with the synaptotagmin C2B domain. Inositol polyphosphates are well known for their ability to modulate interactions between AP-2 and clathrin (59Gaidarov I. Chen Q. Falck J.R. Reddy K.K. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20922-20929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and enhance the recognition of YXXΦ sorting signals by AP-2 and AP-1 (60Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). They could also modulate AP-2 binding to synaptotagmins. Therefore, the C2B domain of synaptotagmin appears to be in a critical position to influence several aspects of coated pit assembly and function. The presence of the truncated synaptotagmin in the cell would cause the formation of oligomeric complexes that lack the C2B domain, thereby depleting the complex of binding sites for structural and regulatory molecules critical for coated pit assembly. These conditions might also lead to the assembly of defective pits. Neurons express very high levels of the various synaptotagmins whereas other cells, such as fibroblasts or hepatocytes, appear to have very low levels of these proteins. The relationship between expression level and the role these proteins play in endocytosis is unclear. It is possible that the observed levels of synaptotagmins in non-neuronal cells is sufficient to support coated pit assembly. We also cannot rule out the possibility that an additional, yet to be identified, synaptotagmin expressed in these cells is the critical molecule for coated pit assembly. Alternatively, synaptotagmins may play a regulatory role in coated pit assembly and are only required at high levels in cells like neurons where fast, high throughput synaptic vesicle traffic demands a more rapid and efficient endocytic machinery. Multiple proteins are now known to be involved in coated pit budding, suggesting that the anchoring of the clathrin to the membrane and its subsequent action during invagination is a complex process.

ApoE is a 299-amino acid, 34-kDa glycoprotein existing as one of three major isoforms that differ in the residues at positions 112 and 158. ApoE2 contains a cysteine at both sites; apoE3 (the most common isoform) has an arginine replacing the cysteine at 158; and apoE4 contains arginine at both 112 and 158. The intact protein is composed of two domains, a 10-kDa C-terminal domain with high lipid binding affinity and a 22-kDa N-terminal domain that is responsible for high affinity low density lipoprotein receptor binding (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–191) in the absence of lipid reveals a globular bundle of four antiparallel, amphipathic α-helices (8Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). This structure presents a hydrophilic exterior comprised of polar and charged amino acids that sequesters a hydrophobic core of apolar residues.Studies of the isolated N-terminal domain revealed that the helix bundle conformation is receptor-inactive, while lipid association confers low density lipoprotein receptor binding activity (9Innerarity T.L.

ApoE-N-terminal domain forms discoidal complexes with phospholipid, and these receptor-active particles provide a model system for studying the lipid-associated state (9Innerarity T.L.

Phospholipid binding is accompanied by little change in the global α-helix content of the protein (10Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that a tertiary structural alteration occurs in a manner such that helical boundaries that define the bundle are maintained. Studies of the surface properties of apoE N-terminal domain at the air/water interface indicate that the helix bundle can undergo a pronounced conformational change resulting in exposure of its hydrophobic interior (13Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Miller N.E. Tall A.R. High Density Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis III. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 175-181Google Scholar). Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy of recombinant apoE3 (N-terminal residues 1–183) showed that the protein orients around the periphery of phospholipid bilayer discs with its α-helical axes perpendicular to the fatty acyl chains (12Raussens V. Fisher C.A. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent FRET studies of apoE3-(1–183) employing an extrinsic energy acceptor covalently bound to Cys112 revealed that, upon phospholipid binding, helix 1 repositions away from helix 3 (14Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with a model in which the four-helix bundle opens about a “hinge” located between helices 2 and 3 such that helices 1 and 2 move away from helices 3 and 4 (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The net effect of this putative conformational alteration is exposure of a continuous hydrophobic surface that is available for lipid interaction. In the present study, FRET analysis of apoE3-(1–183) variants containing single Trp residues introduced into different helical segments has permitted more refined mapping of the relative position of helices in apoE3-(1–183)·dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) disc complexes.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe N-terminal domain of wild type apoE3, with four Trp residues (energy donors) located in the region of helix 1, is amenable to FRET analysis. The single Cys at position 112 (helix 3) provides a convenient site for covalent attachment of an extrinsic energy acceptor. Problems associated with the use of wild type apoE3-(1–183), however, include the presence of multiple energy donors and the unknown contribution of intermolecular energy transfer in disc complexes that possess multiple copies of apoE3-(1–183). To circumvent these complications and to gain insight into the movement of other helices relative to the modified Cys in helix 3, naturally occurring Trp residues in apoE3-(1–183) were changed to Phe by site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, we created a Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) and single Tyr → Trp apoE3-(1–183) mutants for FRET studies (TableI). Far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy of apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] (containing five substitution mutations) revealed an α-helix content characteristic of N-terminal apoE3, indicating that the mutations introduced did not affect the α-helix secondary structure content of the protein.Table IFluorescence properties of apoE3-(1–183) variantsApoE3-(1–183) 1-a[email protected] refers to a single Trp mutant apoE3-(1–183), and the number indicates the amino acid position of the lone Trp.Lipid-freeDMPC-boundλmax 1-bExcitation wavelength was 295 nm.Q 1-cQuantum yield is based on a value of 0.20 for 30 mm tryptophan in butanol.λmaxQWT3440.193440.28[email protected]3510.053480.09[email protected]3410.153370.18[email protected]3360.09ND 1-dND, not determined.ND[email protected]3390.183390.291-a [email protected] refers to a single Trp mutant apoE3-(1–183), and the number indicates the amino acid position of the lone Trp.1-b Excitation wavelength was 295 nm.1-c Quantum yield is based on a value of 0.20 for 30 mm tryptophan in butanol.1-d ND, not determined.

Similar spectra were obtained for each of the single Trp mutants (Table I), whereas Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) did not give rise to significant fluorescence emission upon excitation at 295 nm. Wild type apoE3-(1–183) displayed a fluorescence emission λ maximum of 344 nm, in agreement with previously determined values (10Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission observed for lipid-free apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] was red-shifted compared with the other single Trp variants, indicating that naturally occurring Trp39 is more solvent-exposed than the single Trp variants created by replacement of Tyr residues in the protein. Consistent with predictions based on the x-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal fragment of apoE3, Trp residues introduced at position 74 (helix 2), 118 (helix 3), or 162 (helix 4) displayed blue-shifted λmax values. There was significant variability in Trp quantum yield (Q), ranging from 0.18 for apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] to 0.05 for apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] This variability may be attributed to fluorescence quenching as a function of the relative solvent exposure of the different Trp residues. Lipid association resulted in an increase in Q and a 3–4 nm blue shift in the Trp emission wavelength maximum for apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] and apoE3-(1–183)[email protected]Following characterization of the fluorescence properties of the different apoE3-(1–183) variants, the proteins were labeled on cysteine 112 with AEDANS. Guanidine HCl denaturation experiments, monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy, using AEDANS-labeled apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] and apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] revealed denaturation midpoints between 2.3 and 2.5 m, similar to that reported for WT apoE N-terminal domain (18Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that neither modification of Cys112 with AEDANS nor the substitution mutations introduced into the protein adversely affect the four-helix bundle structure or stability properties. In the case of AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected], excitation at 295 nm induced a large decrease in Trp fluorescence quantum yield accompanied by the appearance of a new fluorescence peak centered around 480 nm (Fig. 1). This peak corresponds to AEDANS emission following nonradiative energy transfer from excited Trp39. The relative peak intensities are dependent upon the distance between the donor and acceptor chromophores in the folded protein as reflected by the efficiency (E) of energy transfer. TableII gives E values derived from donor (Trp) emission peak intensity for lipid-free and phospholipid disc particle-bound AEDANS-labeled apoE3-(1–183) proteins. For each mutant studied, DMPC interaction resulted in a decrease in the efficiency of energy transfer.

Open table in a new tab When AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] was bound to DMPC, a significant reduction in the efficiency of energy transfer occurred, as indicated by the increase in Trp emission peak intensity (340 nm) together with a pronounced decrease in AEDANS emission intensity (Fig.2). On the other hand, fluorescence spectra of discs prepared with Trp-null apoE3-(1–183)/AEDANS-labeled Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) verified the lack of Trp in this variant and demonstrated that direct excitation of AEDANS at this wavelength is minimal. In the case of single Trp variants, it is conceivable that energy transfer occurs between chromophores located on different disc complexes (interdisc energy transfer). To determine if interdisc energy transfer contributes to the observed results, disc complexes prepared using apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] were mixed with a second population of discs prepared using AEDANS-Trp-null apoE3-(1–183). In this case, no energy transfer was detected, indicating that interdisc energy transfer in this system is negligible (data not shown). Likewise, since multiple copies of apoE3-(1–183) are bound per disc, it is conceivable that intermolecular energy transfer could complicate interpretation of FRET data and subsequent distance measurements. To control for this possibility, Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) was used to dilute AEDANS-labeled single Trp apoE3-(1–183) variants (4:1 weight ratio). The spectrum of DMPC-bound AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] diluted with Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) exhibited only a small difference in the ratio of Trp to AEDANS fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2), indicating that the extent of intermolecular energy transfer between this chromophore pair is minimal. In a similar manner, spectra of DMPC-bound WT AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183) or AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] revealed decreases in AEDANS fluorescence intensity that were similar to those observed for apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] Furthermore, these spectra were largely unaffected by dilution with Trp-null apoE3-(1–183), consistent with conclusions drawn earlier regarding lipid binding-induced repositioning of helix 1 and helix 3 (14Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

In contrast to results obtained with WT apoE3-(1–183) or mutants with single Trp residues at positions 39 or 74, interaction of AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] with DMPC to form discoidal lipid particles did not induce a significant change in Trp or AEDANS emission intensity. To assess the contribution of intermolecular energy transfer to the spectrum of DMPC-bound AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected], dilution experiments were performed using Trp-null apoE3-(1–183). In this case, a dramatic increase in Trp fluorescence intensity was observed together with a corresponding decrease in AEDANS emission. Thus, unlike the other single Trp variant apoE3-(1–183) proteins, it appears that DMPC binding results in repositioning of Trp162 to a location where it is available to excite an AEDANS moiety located on a neighboring apoE3-(1–183) in the disc complex. The residual energy transfer observed upon dilution of AEDANS apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] with Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) probably reflects the newly established intramolecular distance between Cys112 and Trp162.Figure 3Energy transfer in AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] Solid line, AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] in buffer; dotted line, AEDANS-apoE3-(1–183)[email protected]·DMPC discs;dashed line, Trp-null apoE3-(1–183)/AEDANS-apoE3- ()[email protected] (4:1, w/w)·DMPC disc complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As shown in Table IV, FRET-derived distances from lipid-free AEDANS-labeled apoE3-(1–183) single Trp variants are in good agreement with values obtained from the x-ray crystal structure of this protein. For DMPC-bound protein, however, all FRET-derived distances do not agree with values inferred from a simple conformational opening of the four-helix bundle (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The value for WT apoE3-(1–183) was lower (36 ± 3.0 versus 44 ± 4 Å) than that previously reported (14Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since energy transfer observed with this protein represents the average contribution of the four Trp residues in the vicinity of helix 1, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions, although it is clear that interaction with DMPC results in an increased distance between helix 1 and helix 3. When three of the four Trp residues in WT apoE3-(1–183) were replaced by Phe to generate apoE3-(1–183)[email protected], the measured distance between AEDANS and Trp39 also increased upon interaction with DMPC. This increase, however, is somewhat less than that expected on the basis of simple conformational opening of the helix bundle. Because other fluorescence data (Fig. 1) indicate that Trp39 is relatively exposed to solvent, its orientation relative to the AEDANS acceptor group may be unique. Thus, it will be important to compare distance values derived from other variants with single Trp residues in helix 1. In the case of apoE3-(1–183)[email protected], DMPC binding resulted in increased distance between Trp74 and AEDANS-Cys112, consistent with reorganization of the helix bundle. The observed change in distance between Trp162 and the AEDANS moiety on Cys112 upon interaction with phospholipid (and dilution with Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) suggests that helix 4 repositions relative to helix 3 upon interaction with DMPC.Table IVDistance measurements from FRET analysis of AEDANS-labeled apoE3-(1–183) variantsApoE3-(1–183)RLipid-freeDMPC-bound measured a,cMeasured 4-aFrom FRET measurements.Calculated 4-bDistance calculations determined using the program Insight II (Biosym, San Diego).ÅÅÅWT23.1 ± 0.42136.0 ± 3.0[email protected]19.4 ± 2.01728.3 ± 2.0[email protected]24.5 ± 0.92440.1 ± 0.1[email protected]23.1 ± 0.82432.4 ± 0.1c DMPC discs were made as per Fisheret al.

R 0 used in distance measurements was obtained from discs made in the absence of Trp-null protein.4-a From FRET measurements.4-b Distance calculations determined using the program Insight II (Biosym, San Diego). Open table in a new tab To examine this phenomenon further, intermolecular energy transfer was evaluated using discs containing AEDANS-labeled Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) and a given unlabeled apoE3-(1–183) single Trp mutant (4:1 ratio; w/w). In this design, AEDANS can only be excited by energy transfer from a Trp donor present on a neighboring apoE3-(1–183) in the disc complex. Background AEDANS emission was established from spectra of discs containing AEDANS-labeled Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) and Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) (Fig. 4). AEDANS emission intensity from these latter discs was similar to that observed for complexes containing apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] or apoE3-(1–183)[email protected], indicating that intermolecular energy transfer between single Trp residues on helix 2 or helix 3 of a given apoE3-(1–183) and AEDANS bound to Cys112 of Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) is negligible. When disc complexes containing AEDANS-labeled Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) and apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] were examined, however, energy transfer was observed, indicating that, upon interaction with DMPC, Trp162 repositions to a location where it can effectively serve as an energy donor to an AEDANS moiety present on a second, neighboring apoE3-(1–183) molecule. In a similar manner, energy transfer was also detected between apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] and AEDANS-labeled Trp-null apoE3-(1–183). Thus, it appears that, in DMPC complexes, apoE3-(1–183) can orient in such a way that helix 3 and helix 4 of one molecule are positioned nearby helix 4 and helix 3 of a second apoE3-(1–183), respectively. By the same token, this does not appear to be the case for helix 1 or helix 2.Figure 4Intermolecular energy transfer between AEDANS-labeled Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) and unlabeled single Trp apoE3-(1–183) variants in disc complexes. Discs were prepared by co-sonication of DMPC with a 4:1 mass ratio of AEDANS-Trp-null apoE3-(1–183)/unlabeled apoE3-(1–183) variant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The excitation value at the absorption maxima of AEDANS (340 nm) was used to normalize the intensity of the fluorescence spectra to the amount of AEDANS-Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) present per disc. Emission spectra were recorded following excitation at 295 nm. The different unlabeled apoE3-(1–183) variants employed were as follows: Trp-null apoE3-(1–183) (solid line); apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] (dotted line); apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] (dashed line); apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] (dotted line with triangles); apoE3-(1–183)[email protected] (dotted line with circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, the data presented in this study are consistent with an alternate open conformation model (Fig.5) wherein helix 3 from one molecule aligns with helix 4 of a second molecule, each adopting a partially extended open conformation. This model is consistent with the fact that no interhelical salt bridges exist between helix 1 or 2 and helix 3 or 4. Thus, opening of the bundle about the hinged loop connecting helix 2 and helix 3 would not disrupt any interhelical salt bridges. On the other hand, five interhelical salt bridges exist between residues in helix 3 and helix 4 in the bundle conformation (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that although the present model requires disruption of such intramolecular salt bridges, they could be replaced by similar or new intermolecular helix 3-helix 4 salt bridges between paired apoE molecules. While this conformational change does not appear to be the most energetically favorable, it is consistent with data currently available. Clearly, other possibilities exist including an antiparallel “belt” arrangement of fully extended apoE molecules. Further study, including FRET analysis of other apoE variants will be required to verify or reject the model presented in Fig. 5. The present model implies that each disc possesses an even number of apoE3-(1–183) molecules. Calculation of the number of apoE3-(1–183) per disc as described by Pitas et al. (19Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5454-5460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), based on an average particle diameter of 15 nm and a lipid/protein molar ratio of 150:1, yields a value of 3.5 apoE3-(1–183) per disc. Assuming four apoE3-(1–183) per disc, these data correspond to a particle molecular weight of 440,000. Previous hydrodynamic and electrophoretic characterization of apoE3-(1–183)-DMPC discs, however, indicated a molecular weight of approximately 600,000 (15Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), implying that discs may exist with up to six apoE3-(1–183). This possibility is not inconsistent with apoE3-(1–183)·DMPC disc size heterogeneity observed by electron microscopy (15Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Figure 5Model of the phospholipid bilayer disc-bound conformation of the N-terminal domain of apoE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An interesting aspect of this model is the fact that it presents a tandem arrangement of the receptor-binding region of the protein (residues 130–150 in helix 4). Given the side by side arrangement produced by this juxtaposition, this molecular organization offers an explanation for earlier results that indicate synergy with respect to apoE copy number and receptor binding activity (20Kowal R.C.

Such a concept also fits well with the presence of seven independently folded, calcium-chelating, ligand-binding repeats in the receptor molecule (21Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M.

In this study, we have characterized the transactivation domain of PTTG. Transient transfection of fusion constructs containing GAL4 DNA-binding domain and different parts of PTTG indicated the transactivation domain of PTTG is located between amino acids 119 and 164. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade is important in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. Therefore, we have explored the possibility that this kinase cascade plays a role in regulating PTTG transactivation function. Activation of the MAP kinase cascade by epidermal growth factor or an expression vector for a constitutively active form of the MAP kinase kinase (MEK1) led to stimulation of PTTG transactivation activity. We showed that PTTG is phosphorylated in vitro on Ser162 by MAP kinase and that this phosphorylation site plays an essential role in PTTG transactivation function. We demonstrated that PTTG interacts directly with MEK1 through a putative SH3 domain-binding site located between amino acids 51 and 54 and that this interaction is crucial for PTTG transactivation function. In addition, we showed that activation of MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade resulted in nuclear translocation of PTTG.

Overexpression of PTTG protein in 3T3 fibroblasts resulted in cell transformation in vitro, and injection of transfected 3T3 cells into nude mice resulted in tumor formation, indicating PTTG is a transforming gene (1Pei L.

In addition to pituitary tumors, PTTG mRNA is also expressed in a variety of primary tumors and tumor cell lines including carcinomas of lung, breast, melanoma, leukemia, and lymphoma (3Zhang X.

However, among normal adult tissues, PTTG mRNA is only expressed to high levels in the testis, with lower expression detected in thymus and intestines (1Pei L. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 2Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentini A. Nakashoma M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol.

PTTG mRNA is expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids in a stage-specific manner during the rat spermatogenic cycle (6Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and an enhancer element important for PTTG transcriptional activation in germ cells has been identified (7Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5219-5225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screening identified ribosomal protein S10 and a novel DnaJ homologue HSJ2 as binding partners to PTTG in testicular germ cells (7Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5219-5225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that PTTG may be involved in regulating male germ cell differentiation. In a recent study, PTTG was identified as a vertebrate sister-chromatid separation inhibitor, and degradation of PTTG was required for sister-chromatid separation (8Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The expression level of PTTG was found to be up-regulated in rapidly proliferating cells and was regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, peaking in mitosis (9Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Romero F. Luna R. Multon M.-C. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that PTTG may play a role in regulatory pathways involved in controlling cell proliferation. Transcriptional regulation is an essential control point for diverse cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. The involvement of PTTG in transcriptional control was first demonstrated by the finding that the C-terminal region of PTTG could act as a transactivation domain when fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain (5Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Segura D.I. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One of the target genes for PTTG transactivation function is basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Overexpression of PTTG in transfected cells stimulated expression of bFGF, and point mutations of the putative SH3-binding sites within the C-terminal region of PTTG abrogated the increase in bFGF expression (2Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentini A. Nakashoma M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that PTTG was able to transactivate the bFGF transcription in the presence of a novel PTTG-binding factor (10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19422-19427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that transcriptional activation is one of the important mechanisms for PTTG actions. However, the mechanism of PTTG transactivation function and the amino acid sequences involved in this function have yet to be characterized. In this study we have performed detailed deletion and point mutation analysis to localize precisely PTTG transactivation domain. The stimulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation involves the activation of signaling pathways that are initiated by specific receptors at the cell surface. Many of these signaling pathways converge on the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, a module consisting of MAP kinase kinase (MEK1 and -2, also known as ERK kinase or as MKK), MAP kinase (MAPK 1 and 2, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase or ERK), and its downstream targets. These kinases form three successive tiers of a cascade in which MEK phosphorylates and activates MAPK and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylates and activates its downstream target (11Sturgill T.W.

An important target of MAP kinase cascade is the regulation of gene expression in the nucleus. MAP kinase was shown to phosphorylate and activate several nuclear transcription factors. The proto-oncogene product c-Myc is phosphorylated on Ser62 by MAP kinase (17Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzales F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Similarly, phosphorylation of NF-IL6 at Thr235 by MAP kinase caused an increase in transactivation of gene expression by NF-IL6 (21Nagajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M.

MAP kinase phosphorylation of p62TCF/Elk-1, a component of the ternary complex bound to the serum response element, was shown to be responsible for mitogen-stimulated function of serum response element (22Gille H.

We show here that transactivation function of PTTG is enhanced by activation of MAP kinase cascade. We demonstrate that PTTG is phosphorylated by MAP kinase at Ser162 in vitroand that this site plays a critical role in PTTG transactivation function. We explored the possibility that PTTG directly interacts with one or more components of the MAP kinase cascade. We show here that PTTG interacts with MEK1 through an SH3 domain-binding motif located at the N terminus of PTTG and that this interaction is required to mediate the effect of MAPK cascade activation on PTTG transactivation function. Furthermore, we provide evidence that activation of MAPK phosphorylation cascade leads to PTTG nuclear translocation. Together our data establish that MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade has an important functional role in regulating PTTG transactivation activity. The reporter plasmid (5×GAL4-E1B-LUC) containing five GAL4-binding sites inserted in front of E1B minimal promoter linked to luciferase (24Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A.

The construction of expression vector containing GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pGAL4DBD) and the GAL4DBD-VP16 fusion constructs were described previously (25Baniahmad A. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R.

The wild type PTTG and the N-terminal 60-amino acid deletion mutants were constructed by digesting pAS2PTTG and pAS2PTTGm2 (6Pei L. J. Biol.

After filling the ends with DNA polymerase I, the blunt ended insert was clone at SmaI site of GAL4DBD to generate GAL-PTTG-(1–199) and GAL-PTTG-(61–199). To generate N-terminal 118-amino acid deletion mutant, GST-PTTG (6Pei L. J. Biol.

The 5′ overhang and the 3′ overhang were repaired by DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA polymerase, respectively. The blunt-ended insert was cloned intoSmaI site of GAL4DBD, resulting in plasmid GAL-PTTG-(164–199). Deletion mutant GAL-PTTG-(119–164) was generated using ExSite polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). To generate C-terminal 81-amino acid deletion mutant, GAL-PTTG-(1–199) was digested withXbaI. After filling the end with DNA polymerase I, the plasmid was digested with SmaI. The religation of the larger fragment resulted in GAL-PTTG-(1–118). Point mutations of PTTG were generated using QickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Fusion protein between PTTG and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was obtained by subcloning the coding region of PTTG into theBglII and HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1. Point mutations of PTTG were generated as described above. Histidine-tagged PTTG was generated by inserting the coding region of PTTG atEcoRI site of pcDNA/His expression vector (Invitrogen). GST-PTTG fusion construct was described previously (6Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Deletions and point mutations of the fusion protein were made similar to GAL-PTTG fusion plasmids. HA-tagged, constitutively active and inactive mutants of MEK1 were provided by Dr. N. G. Ahn (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). Expression plasmids for MAPK (wild type and kinase defective mutants) were obtained from Dr. M. Cobb (University of Texas, Dallas, TX). COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. EGF and PD098059 were purchased from Calbiochem. Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (7Pei L. J. Biol.

All transfections were performed in triplicate, and each DNA construct was tested in at least three independent experiments. Forty eight hours post-transfection cells were lysed in 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.8, with three freeze and thaw cycles. Cell lysates (50 μg/assay) were assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (7Pei L. J. Biol.

Transfected cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VaO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). For immunoprecipitation, 0.5 mg of the cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of anti-Express for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein A/G-agarose was then added and was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed 5 time with the lysis buffer, eluted in loading buffer, and fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE. After electron transfer, the membrane was probed using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance Research Product Inc.), diluted 1:2000. For Western blot analysis using anti-GAL4DBD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 20 μg of cell lysate was fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and incubated with the antibody diluted 1:500. Detection was performed using ECL system. COS-7 cells were transfected with HA-MEK1 or HA-MPK expression vectors. MEK1 and MAPK were immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of lysate using 2 μg of anti-HA antibody as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with the lysis buffer and 3 times with PBS. They were then incubated in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, 10 μCi per assay), and GST-PTTG expressed in and purified fromEscherichia coli (10 μg/reaction) as substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated products were visualized by autoradiography. Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 90 min. Cells were centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VaO4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was added to Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After three washes with the lysis buffer, the fusion proteins immobilized on the beads were incubated with 300 μg of cell lysate from cells transfected with HA-tagged MEK1 at 4 °C for 2 h. After 5 washes in the lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nylon membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-HA antibody (Covance Research Product Inc.), diluted 1:2000. COS-7 cells were transfected with GFP-PTTG (wild type or mutants) and HA-MEK1, either alone or in combination. Cells were fixed 24 h post-transfection with 2% neutral buffered formaldehyde (2% formaldehyde, 20 mmNaPO4, pH 7.4) for 15 min at 37 °C, washed 3 times with PBS, and blocked with 1% fetal calf serum in PBS. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 1:100 anti-HA antibody (Covance Research Product Inc.) for 1 h and with 1:50 anti-mouse Ig rhodamine (Chemicon) for 1 h at 37 °C, with 3 PBS washes after each incubation. Slides were examined with fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence data are based on multiple transfection experiments. Previous studies showed that PTTG could function as a transcriptional activator (5Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Segura D.I. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and activate transcription of bFGF gene (10Chien W. Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19422-19427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid sequences responsible for this function have yet to be defined. To localize the transcriptional activation domain of PTTG, fusion constructs were made between various regions of PTTG and the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DBD, amino acids 1–147). The GAL4-DBD contains signals for dimerization (26Carey M.F. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and nuclear translocation (27Silver P.A. Chiang A. Sadler I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in addition to its specific DNA binding activity and shows no transactivation function (26Carey M.F. Kakidani H. Leatherwood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 27Silver P.A. Chiang A. Sadler I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids coding for GAL4-DBD fused to various parts of PTTG were transfected into COS-7 cells together with a reporter plasmid containing five GAL4-binding sites in front of E1B minimal promoter linked to luciferase (24Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, wild type PTTG activated reporter gene transcription about 82-fold (Fig. 1 A, construct wt). Deletion of up to 118 amino acids from the N terminus does not affect PTTG transactivation activity (Fig. 1 A, constructs 61–199 and 119–199). Additional deletion of the C-terminal 35 amino acids has little effect on PTTG transactivation function (Fig. 1 A, construct 119–164). However, deletion of either 164 amino acids from the N terminus or 81 amino acids from the C terminus resulted in complete loss of transcriptional activation (Fig.1 A, constructs 164–199 and 1–118). The expression of all the GAL4-PTTG fusion constructs in transfected cells was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that amino acids between positions 118 and 164 are responsible for PTTG transcriptional activation activity. Compared with the strong transcriptional activator VP16, PTTG is a relatively weak activator (Fig. 1 A). The stimulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation involves the activation of signaling pathways that are initiated by specific receptors at the cell surface. Many of these signaling pathways converge on MAP kinase cascade and its downstream targets. MAP kinase was shown to phosphorylate and activate several nuclear transcription factors (18Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Seth A. Alvarez E. Gupta S. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The presence of a consensus phosphorylation site within the PTTG transactivation domain (amino acids 161–164 PPSP) (17Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzales F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether activation of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway affects PTTG transcriptional activation function. EGF is one of the growth factors that is known to activate MAPK signaling transduction pathway (28Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Blennis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of EGF on transcriptional activation function of PTTG. As shown in Fig.2 A, treatment of transfected cells with EGF resulted in 6-fold increase in GAL-PTTG transactivation activity. A primary pathway for MAP kinase activation by EGF consists of sequential activation of guanine exchange factor SOS, the guanosine triphosphate-binding protein Ras, and the protein kinases Raf-1, MEK1 or -2, and ERKs (30Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 31Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 32Warne P.H. Viciana P.R. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 33Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). To test whether EGF exerts its effect on PTTG transactivation function through this pathway, we initially asked whether PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, would affect EGF-stimulated transactivation function of PTTG. Fig. 2 Ashows that in the presence of 50 μm PD098059, EGF-stimulated transactivation activity of PTTG was inhibited. We then tested the ability of a constitutively active form of MEK1 to activate the MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade. This mutant form of MEK1 was shown to have basal activity several hundred times greater than that of the unphosphorylated wild type kinase and was able to stimulate MAP kinase activity (34Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Herman A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukusawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, expression of constitutively active MEK1 (R4F) resulted in 40-fold increase in transactivation activity of the wild type PTTG, whereas expression of inactive MEK1 mutant (8E) had no effect on PTTG activity. Although expression of constitutively active MEK1 could also increase the transactivation function of the PTTG N-terminal deletion mutants, the effects were much less compared with wild type PTTG (3-versus 40-fold, Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that activation of PTTG transactivation function by MAP kinase cascade requires not only PTTG transactivation domain but also residues within the N-terminal 60 amino acids. We then tested whether activation of MAP kinase cascade also affects the ability of PTTG to transactivate bFGF transcription. Fig.2 C shows that either EGF treatment or co-transfection of the constitutively active form of MEK1 resulted in 2- or 5-fold increase in luciferase activity of bFGF-LUC, respectively, whereas the inactive MEK1 mutant had no effect. The stimulatory effect of EGF and MEK1 on PTTG transactivation of bFGF was also attenuated by treatment of cells with PD098059 (Fig. 2 C). To confirm that enhanced PTTG transactivation activity by expression of the constitutively active MEK1 is mediated by MAP kinase, we then tested the ability of expression vector for kinase-defective mutants of MAPK to function as inhibitors of MEK1-activated reporter gene activity. Although these mutants MAPK can be phosphorylated on activating site, they possess less than 5% of the wild type activity (35Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5016-5097Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and they appear to interfere with endogenous MAPK activity (36Frost J.A. Grppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3844-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,37Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 D, expression vector for kinase-defective MAPK was able to attenuate the ability of the constitutively active MEK1 to activate the GAL-PTTG fusion protein, consistent with role for MAPK in mediating activation signal from MEK1. To determine whether modulation of PTTG transactivation function by activation of MAP kinase signal transduction pathway is a result of direct phosphorylation of PTTG, we tested the ability of MEK1 and MAPK to phosphorylate PTTG in vitro. COS-7 cells were transfected with either constitutively active MEK1 or MAPK expression plasmid. MEK1 and MAPK were immunoprecipitated, and the immunocomplexes were incubated with PTTG expressed in and purified from E. coli in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 3, while MEK1 phosphorylated recombinant MAPK (Fig. 3, lane 2), it did not phosphorylate PTTG (Fig. 3, lane 1). MAPK, on the other hand, was able to phosphorylate PTTG (Fig. 3, lane 3). These results indicate that MAPK is kinase that phosphorylates PTTG. To determine whether the consensus MAPK phosphorylation site located between amino acids 160 and 163 (PPSP) was responsible for PTTG phosphorylation by MAP kinase, si"
https://openalex.org/W1977668555,"Phe667 in the conserved O-helix of Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase I (pol I) is known to be important for discrimination against dideoxy-NTPs. We show here that Phe667 is also important for base selection fidelity. In a forward mutation assay at high polymerase concentration, wild type pol I catalyzed frequent A → T and G → T transversions and −1 frameshifts at nonreiterated sites involving loss of a purine immediately downstream of a pyrimidine. The mutants F667L and A661E,I665T,F667L exhibited large decreases in A → T and G → T transversions, and the triple mutant displayed reduction in the aforementioned −1 frameshifts as well. Kinetic analysis showed that the F667L and A661E,I665T,F667L polymerases discriminated against synthesis of A:A mispairs more effectively and catalyzed less extension of A:A mispairs than the wild type enzyme. These data indicate that Phe667 functions in maintaining the error frequency and spectrum, and the catalytic efficiency, of wild type pol I. We also found that the strong general mutator activity conferred by the single A661E substitution was entirely suppressed in the A661E, I665T,F667L polymerase, exemplifying how interactions among O-helix residues can contribute to fidelity. We discuss the mutator and anti-mutator mutations in light of recently obtained three-dimensional structures of T. aquaticus pol I.

We discuss the mutator and anti-mutator mutations in light of recently obtained three-dimensional structures of T. aquaticus pol I. DNA polymerase I T. aquaticus If DNA polymerases simply polymerized the nucleotides that align and form a stable complex with the template in solution, one mispaired nucleotide would be predicted for every ∼10–100 nucleotides incorporated (1Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Processes that occur at the polymerase active site reduce this error frequency to 10−4–10−5(2Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18251-18254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These processes assure both discrimination between correct and incorrect base pairs in insertion of the incoming nucleotide and discrimination between matched and mismatched base pairs in extension of the newly formed primer terminus. It has long been a goal to understand the structure-function relationships that govern this discrimination (3Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments (4Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallographic studies indicate that DNA polymerase I (pol I)1 family members share highly homologous polymerase domains. Three-dimensional structures are now available for the prototypical large fragment ofEscherichia coli pol I (5Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), forThermus aquaticus (Taq) pol I (38% sequence identity with the E. coli enzyme) (6Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D.-S. Suh S.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9491-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), for Bacillus stearothermophilis pol I (49% identical to the E. colienzyme) (10Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and for the more distantly related T7 DNA polymerase (11Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). In these homologous structures, the polymerase active site is similarly located within a deep, DNA-binding cleft whose architecture has been likened to a right hand. The evolutionarily conserved motif A with its catalytically essential asparatic acid, along with other structural elements of the active site, lies in the palm subdomain that forms the floor of the cleft. The conserved motif B comprises most of the long α-helix O in the fingers subdomain that defines part of one wall of the cleft. A variety of experimental approaches have established that the O-helix is important in binding the incoming dNTP as well as the template-primer. A pioneering model developed for the E. coli pol I Klenow fragment, based on structural, biochemical, and mutagenesis studies, includes roles for four strictly conserved, catalytically crucial amino acids located on the face of the O-helix that lines the polymerase cleft. In this model, Arg754interacts with either the β or γ phosphate of the dNTP, and Lys758 may interact with the α phosphate (12Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The aromatic side chain of Phe762 positions the nucleotide to allow discrimination against substrates containing 2′,3′-dideoxyribose (13Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 14Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Tyr766 at the C terminus of the helix plays a lesser role in positioning the nucleotide and also interacts with the template-primer (12Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies of catalytically competent complexes of T7 DNA polymerase (11Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), B. stearothermophilis pol I (10Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and the large fragment ofTaq pol I (Klentaq1) (8Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 9Li Y. Mitaxov V. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9491-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) support and extend this model. In particular, analysis of Klentaq1 complexed with DNA and ddCTP indicates that, during binding and catalysis, Arg659, Lys663, Phe667, and Tyr671 interact with the dNTP (note that these residues are homologous to the Klenow fragment residues mentioned above), whereas Arg660, Thr664, Gly668, and also Tyr671interact with the DNA. The participation of numerous O-helix residues in dNTP and template-primer binding suggests a concomitant role in governing polymerase fidelity. This premise is borne out by the altered accuracy of certain site-directed mutants of E. coli pol I, namely Y766A and Y766S, which exhibit reduced fidelity (15Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Bell J.B. Eckert K.A. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7345-7351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and R754A (17Minnick D.T. Bebenek K. Osheroff W.P. Turner Jr., R. Astatke M. Liu L. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3067-3075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which exhibits increased fidelity. To augment the supply of informative mutants, we have undertaken another approach to determining the effects of mutation in the O-helix on base selection fidelity. We have introduced randomized sequences into the O-helix of Taqpol I and selected for catalytically active mutants by genetic complementation; interestingly, no amino acid substitutions or only highly conservative substitutions were observed for the four evolutionarily conserved, catalytically crucial residues described above (18Suzuki M. Baskin D. Hood L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9670-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical screening of extracts of active mutants allowed us to identify numerous O-helix variants with presumptively reduced fidelity, two of which we purified and showed to be authentic mutators (19Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we describe two O-helix mutants of Taq pol I that display anti-mutator activity. Both contain a mutation at Phe667, a residue that when changed to Tyr greatly alters sugar discrimination (13Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) but not previously known to be involved in base selection. Our results indicate that Phe667 plays a role in regulating mutational frequency and specificity and maintaining catalytic efficiency. Together with our previous description of low fidelity mutants (19Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that the wild type mutational frequency and spectrum may reflect the contributions and interactions of numerous O-helix residues, including those that directly contact the incoming dNTP and/or template-primer and those that do not. Wild type Taq pol I and its mutant derivatives were selected by complementation of the temperature-sensitive growth of an E. coli strain harboring temperature-sensitive pol I, as previously reported (18Suzuki M. Baskin D. Hood L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9670-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the entire wild type gene and the polymerase domain of each of the mutants was determined. All mutations were within the randomized region, except that each construct lacked the N-terminal 3 amino acids. The mutant F667L was made by site-directed mutagenesis (18Suzuki M. Baskin D. Hood L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9670-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of Taq pol I and its derivatives were as described previously (19Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase activity was determined in assays measuring incorporation of label from [3H]dATP into activated calf thymus DNA at 72 °C (19Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); 1 unit represents incorporation of 10 nmol of dNMP in 1 h, corresponding to 0.1 unit as defined by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. K m andV max for incorporation of dAMP into DNA were measured in assays containing 200 μg/ml activated calf thymus DNA, 10 ng of polymerase, 50 μm each dGTP, dCTP, dTTP, and either 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 μm [3H]dATP in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2; incubation was for 5 min at 72 °C. Incorporation of radioactivity into acid-insoluble products was determined (19Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and total nucleotide incorporation was calculated for each reaction. K mand V max values were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Efficiencies of nucleotide insertion and primer extension were determined by using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-AGG CAC CCC AGG CTT T AC ACT TTA TGC TTC CGG CTC GTA T (template for T:G mismatch measurements (target T in bold type) corresponding to positions −49 to −10 in the lacZα mutational target; see Fig. 1), 5′-ATA CGA GCC GGA AGC ATA AAG TGT (primer for correct/incorrect insertion), 5′-ATA CGA GCC GGA AGC ATA AAG TGT A (primer for extension of matched terminus), 5′-ATA CGA GCC GGA AGC ATA AAG TGT G (primer for extension of mismatched T:G terminus); 5′-CAT CCC CCT TTC GCC A GC TGG CGT AAT AGC GAA GAG GCC T (template for A:A mismatch measurements corresponding to positions +129 to +168 in the lacZα mutational target), 5′-GGG CCT CTT CGC TAT TAC GCC AGC (primer for correct/incorrect insertion), 5′-GGG CCT CTT CGC TAT TAC GCC AGC T (primer for extension of matched terminus), and 5′-GGG CCT CTT CGC TAT TAC GCC AGC A (primer for extension of mismatched A:A terminus). Measurements were performed essentially as described previously (20Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

A final concentration of 5 nm was used in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl. To measure correct incorporation/extension, reactions were carried out at 45 °C for 5 min with 0.063–0.4 nm polymerase and 0.2–200 μm dNTP to achieve less than 20% template-primer utilization. To measure misincorporation/misextension, reactions were carried out 45 °C for 10–60 min with 0.16–25 nmpolymerase and 1.6–400 μm dNTP. For extension of the A:A mismatched primer, 1300 nm F667L polymerase or 1000 nm A661E,I665T,F667L polymerase was incubated with 5 mm dGTP at 45 °C for 60 min. After the reactions were terminated by adding 20 mm EDTA, extension products were analyzed in a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea. The results were quantified by using a Laser Image Analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film, Japan).

The noncoding strand of thelacZα gene contained within 400 ng of gapped M13mp2 DNA (21Feig D.I. Sowers L.C. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6609-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was copied by using the specified amount of wild type or mutant Taq pol I in a reaction mixture containing 200 μm each dNTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl. After incubation at 72 °C for 5 min, the DNA was transfected, and plaques were scored. Nucleotide sequences were determined by using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). We have previously created a large library of O-helix mutants by substituting random nucleotides for the 13 codons that specify amino acids Arg659–Tyr671 in plasmid-borne Taq pol I. Functional mutants were then selected by complementing the temperature-sensitive growth of anE. coli strain harboring a temperature-sensitive host pol I. We obtained 75 active mutants with unique O-helix sequences that supported bacterial growth at nonpermissive temperature (18Suzuki M. Baskin D. Hood L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9670-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To identify mutations that confer increased fidelity, extracts of E. coli expressing mutant Taq pol Is were screened in a primer extension assay in the presence of only three, rather than four complementary dNTPs (19Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Relative to wild type Taq pol I, mutants with increased fidelity would extend a smaller proportion of primers up to and beyond the first template position for which a complementary dNTP is lacking. Following screening, we purified candidate high fidelity polymerases to apparent homogeneity, measured their specific activities, and determined which of the mutant enzymes were able to amplify a 500-base pair fragment in a polymerase chain reaction assay (data not shown). After re-examining the fidelity of the purified, polymerase chain reaction-competent polymerases in the primer extension assay, we chose one mutant, the triply substituted variant A661E,I665T,F667L, for more detailed study. For reference, we also examined the three singly substituted polymerases A661E and I665T, which we previously recovered by genetic complementation (18Suzuki M. Baskin D. Hood L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9670-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and F667L, which we constructed by site-specific mutagenesis. The specific activities of the homogeneous Taq pol Is and their catalytic efficiencies (V max/K m for incorporation of dAMP into activated DNA) relative to wild type are: wild type, 66,000 units/mg protein, 100%; A661E,I665T,F667L, 27,000 units/mg protein, 19%; F667L, 27,000 units/mg protein, 7.2%; I665T, 30,000 units/mg protein, not determined; A661E, 45,000 units/mg protein, 65%. To quantitate the fidelity of in vitro DNA synthesis, we used an M13mp2 forward mutation assay that measures the sum of many different types of polymerase errors in diverse sequence contexts (21Feig D.I. Sowers L.C. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6609-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The mutational target was 214 nucleotides in the lacZα gene located within a single-stranded region in gapped circular double-stranded DNA. As in most other gap filling assays, detection of base substitution errors requires insertion of an incorrect nucleotide and extension of the resulting, mispaired primer terminus. Failure to extend mispairs, and the consequently incomplete gap filling, would result in underestimation of overall mutant frequencies and, presumably, in disproportional loss of particular types of errors. This is so because, upon transfection of partially filled molecules into reporter E. coli, gap filling is completed by the highly accurate host replication machinery, and mispaired termini formed in vitroare subject to exonucleolytic proofreading (23Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. Freeman, New York1992: 498Google Scholar). Particularly prone to loss would be mutations resulting from mispairs that are difficult to extend, e.g. A:A in the case of Taq pol I (24Huang M.M. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In our case, if partial gap filling resulted in underestimation of the capacity of wild type pol I for error synthesis, our ability to document reduced error synthesis by more faithful mutant polymerases might be compromised. To estimate the extent of gap filling, we monitored the reaction products by using agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown); customarily, the reaction is judged to be complete when the product has the mobility of double-stranded circular M13 DNA (22Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, a small minority of partially filled target molecules may escape detection, particularly if heterogeneous in mobility. To avoid this potential problem, we titrated the amount of wild type polymerase in the DNA synthetic reactions and measured the resulting mutant frequencies (Table I). The frequencies found at 2.5 and 1.25 units/μl of wild type Taq pol I were indistinguishable, the average of the four determinations being 17 × 10−3; 2.5 units/μl was five times the concentration required to convert all detectable reaction products to molecules migrating as double-stranded circles (data not shown). The mutant frequency at 0.25 units/μl was lower (5.0 × 10−3), because of incomplete gap filling; as documented below, the lower mutant frequency was accompanied by a markedly different mutational spectrum. The observed frequencies bracket the value of 10 × 10−3 found by Tindall and Kunkel (25Tindall K.R. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) at a lower temperature (55 °C). The average mutant frequency observed at 2.5 and 1.25 units/μl of the A661E,I665T,F667L triple mutant polymerase was 6.0 × 10−3, a ∼3-fold lower value than for wild type pol I (Table I). The average for the F667L polymerase, 6.0 × 10−3, was also 3-fold lower than for the wild type enzyme, whereas the average for the I665T polymerase (22 × 10−3) was similar to wild type. In striking contrast, the frequency for the A661E polymerase (16 × 10−2) was 9.5-fold higher than for wild type pol I, in accord with previous results (19Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Before comparing the error spectra of the wild type and mutant polymerases, we will first describe the mutational specificities obtained with different concentrations of wild type pol I in the DNA synthetic reactions. At a low polymerase concentration (0.25 units/μl), our results resemble the published data of Tindall and Kunkel (25Tindall K.R. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In both cases, transitions outnumbered transversions by at least 2:1, with T → C transitions comprising 67 and 56% of the base substitutions, respectively; no other single mutation approached these proportions. In the Tindall and Kunkel study, all frameshifts occurred in runs of two or more identical bases, suggestive of a direct slippage mechanism; similarly, all but one of our frameshifts occurred in runs. We observed a very different pattern of error synthesis at high pol I concentration (2.5 units/μl) (Table IIand Fig. 1 A). There was a profound shift among base substitutions, such that transversions now outnumbered transitions by nearly 2:1. A → T transversions (34%) and G → T transversions (21%) together constituted over half of the base substitutions, and T → C transitions (23%) no longer predominated. Moreover, there was a remarkably high fraction (13%) of frameshifts at nonreiterated sites. As shown in the mutational spectrum (Fig.1 A), all were deletions of a single purine immediately downstream of a pyrimidine; seven were deletion of an A adjacent to a 3′-T, and three were deletion of G adjacent to a 3′-C or -T. Despite the increases in transversions and frameshifts, the frequencies of T → C transitions at low and high pol I concentrations did not differ (3.4 × 10−3 versus 3.1 × 10−3, respectively). These data suggest that: 1) synthesis and extension of T:G mismatches was relatively facile and reached a maximum, even at low polymerase concentration; and 2) at highTaq pol I concentration where gap filling was forced closer to absolute completion, difficult-to-extend A:A and G:A mispairs that were abandoned by the polymerase at lower concentration were utilized for synthesis of transversion and frameshift mutations.Table IITypes of errors observed for wild type and mutant Taq DNA polymerases in the M13mp2 forward mutation assayError typeWild typeA661E,I665T,F667LF667LI665TA661EN%Frequency (× 103)N%Frequency (M/WT)N%Frequency (M/WT)N%Frequency (M/WT)N%Frequency (M/WT)All errors7510016.5701001/2.8591001/2.7631001.3501009.5Base substitutions618113.468971/2.344751/3.046731.242849.8 Transitions22294.863901.132541/1.511181/1.3193812 T→C14193.147671.319321/1.6351/3.0112211 C→T681.314201/1.19151/1.4581.351012 G→A12200 A→G10233 Transversions39528.6571/2012201/7.035561.423468.4 T→G12122 T→A31322 C→G00100 C→A00000 G→T13172.9111/33231/1417272.0102011 G→C10210 A→C01110 A→T21284.60<1/54231/2312191/1.19186.1Frameshifts14193.1231/1815251/2.017271.98168.1 In runs450.88231/5.18141/1.16102.34814 In non-runs10132.200>1/267121/3.111171.7485.7 Δ-pur, 5′-pur10132.200>1/267121/3.110161.6485.7 Δ-A, 5′-T791.500>1/186101/2.59142.0366.1Nucleotide sequences were obtained for mutant plaques collected from copying reactions containing 2.5 units/μl of polymerase.

Open table in a new tab Nucleotide sequences were obtained for mutant plaques collected from copying reactions containing 2.5 units/μl of polymerase. The number of occurrences of each error type (N) and the percent of total errors observed are recorded. The error frequencies observed for the wild type polymerase and the error frequencies relative to wild type observed for the mutant polymerases were calculated from the sequence data and the mutant frequencies of Table I. The types of errors catalyzed by the mutant polymerases in reactions containing 2.5 units/μl are recorded in Table II. As in the case of wild type pol I, the mutant frequencies observed at this polymerase concentration were no greater than found at 1.25 units/μl (Table I). The error spectrum observed for the triple mutant polymerase (Table II and Fig. 1 B) was strikingly different from wild type, consisting almost entirely (63/70, 90%) of transitions, mainly T → C and C → T. Importantly, the frequency of transitions was essentially the same as observed for wild type pol I (5.4 × 10−3 versus 4.8 × 10−3, calculated from the data in Tables I and II). However, the frequency of transversions was reduced 20-fold, due to >50- and >30-fold reductions, respectively, in A → T and G → T substitutions. Only two frameshifts were observed (3% of total mutations) in a run of either C or T; no frameshifts were found at nonreiterated sites. Thus, the 3-fold decrease in overall mutant frequency found for the A661E,I665T,F667L polymerase was conferred by large reductions in A → T and G → T transversions and by a greater than 20-fold reduction in the distinctive −1 frameshifts consisting of loss of a purine residue located 3′ of a pyrimidine at nonreiterated sites. These data suggest that the triple mutant polymerase catalyzes less synthesis of A:A and G:A mispairs and/or less extension of these mispairs than wild type pol I via either direct elongation or elongation in conjunction with misalignment. The mutational specificity of the I665T polymerase (Table II), like the overall mutant frequency, was similar to wild type with respect to the types of errors synthesized, the distribution of base substitutions, and the high proportion of −1 frameshifts involving loss of a purine downstream of a pyrimindine (16% versus 13%). As a single mutation, then, the I665T substitution had no notable effect on fidelity. The F667L polymerase, which exhibited an overall mutant frequency about one-third of wild type (Table I), displayed an error specificity comprising elements of both the wild type and A661E,I665T,F667L specificities. The frequency of transitions was similar to that of wild type (3.3 × 10−3 versus 4.8 × 10−3), consisting largely of T → C and C → T mutations in wild type-like proportions. Akin to"

Here we report that Syk is required for the activation of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-Akt survival pathway in B cells exposed to oxidative stress. Phosphorylation and activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt were markedly increased in B cells treated with H2O2. In Syk-deficient DT40 cells treated with low doses of H2O2 (10–100 μm), Akt activation was considerably reduced. Pretreatment with wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase-specific inhibitor, completely blocked the Syk-dependent Akt activation. Following stimulation by low doses of H2O2, a significant increase in PI 3-kinase activity was found in wild-type but not in Syk-deficient cells. These findings suggest that PI 3-kinase mediates Syk-dependent Akt activation pathway. Furthermore, viability of Syk-deficient cells, after exposure to H2O2, was dramatically decreased and caspase-9 activity was greatly increased compared with that of the wild-type cells. These results suggest that Syk is essential for the Akt survival pathway in B cells and enhances cellular resistance to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.

Genetic studies using Syk-deficient B cells have revealed that Syk is essential for the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation following oxidative stress (9Qin S.

Thus, it has been obvious that Syk plays a crucial role in the transduction of oxidative stress signaling in B cells. It has been demonstrated that oxidative stress induces apoptotic and necrotic cell death in many cell types (11Lee Y.-J. Shacter E.

On the other hand, oxidative stress can trigger the activation of some signaling pathways that are involved in cell survival including the phosphorylation cascades leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and the serine-threonine kinase Akt (10Qin S.

However, the role of oxidative stress-induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of Akt survival pathway is not clear. In this paper, we report on the role of Syk in the activation of Akt survival pathway in B cells exposed to oxidative stress. We have found that Syk is required for the activation of Akt survival pathway and enhances cellular resistance to cell death in B cells exposed to oxidative stress.

DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml kanamycin in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells, collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended (1 × 107 cells/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were stimulated by H2O2 at 37 °C with gentle stirring at concentrations described in the figure legends. Stimulated cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μmNa3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated sequentially (1 h for each incubation) with antibodies and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at 4 °C. Whole-cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). Blots were probed with the indicated antibodies, and immunoreactive proteins were revealed by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products). Akt in vitro kinase assay was performed by the method of Kelley et al. (24Kelley T.W. Graham M.M. Doseff A.I. Pomerantz R.W. Lau S.M. Ostrowski M.C. Franke T.F. Marsh C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26393-26398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Stimulated cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were lysed in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmsodium glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated sequentially (1 h for each incubation) with anti-Akt antibody and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at 4 °C. Sample was washed three times with buffer A, twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.03% Brij 35, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), and once with assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Immune complexes were then resuspended in 30 μl of assay dilution buffer containing 10 μg of histone 2B, 25 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of the appropriate volume of 3× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and evaluated by autoradiography. PI 3-kinase assay was performed by the method of Aagaard-Tillery et al. (25Aagaard-Tillery K.M. Jelinek D.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4543-4554PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate at 1 mg/ml were added to immunoprecipitates obtained from cell lysates using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm MgCl2, 40 μm ATP, 200 μm adenosine, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, reactions were stopped with 200 μl of 1 mHCl. Then 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) were added, and samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 s at 4 °C. Aqueous phase was discarded, and 160 μl of methanol, 1m HCl (1:1) was added to the organic phase; samples were vortexed and centrifuged; and the organic phase was extracted again. Following evaporation under a stream of nitrogen, lipid residues were dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1). Phosphoinositides were separated by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 plates in running solvent (n-propanol, 2 m acetic acid (65:35)). Radiolabeled phosphoinositides were detected by autoradiography. Wild-type DT40 and mutant cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were stimulated using the indicated concentrations of H2O2. After 22 h, cell viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Wild-type and Syk-deficient DT40 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were stimulated with the indicated concentration of H2O2 for 22 h. 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml protein K) for 20 min at room temperature followed by a 30-min incubation with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A at 50 °C. DNA fragmentation was analyzed using a 2.5% agarose gel in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. After stimulation by H2O2, cell lysates were tested for protease activity by the addition of a caspase-9-specific peptide that is conjugated to the color reporter molecule p-nitroanilide (LEHD-pNA substrate) using the Caspase-9 Colorimetric Assay (R&D Systems Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We have previously reported that Syk is activated by oxidative stress and plays a crucial role in Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and JNK activation in B cells, suggesting that Syk is a key molecule in the transduction of oxidative stress signals (9Qin S. Inazu T. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Homma Y. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Qin S. Minami Y. Hibi M. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2098-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been reported that cells exhibit resistance to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via the activation of Akt survival pathway (19Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Yokota E.A. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the role of Syk in the activation of Akt survival pathway in DT40 B cells exposed to oxidative stress. Wild-type or Syk-deficient cells were treated with various concentrations of H2O2, and the whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting analysis using anti-phospho-Akt antibody, which recognizes phosphorylated Ser-473 of Akt, an active form of Akt. In wild-type cells, Akt was rapidly phosphorylated and reached maximum phosphorylation at 10 min after stimulation with 100 μmH2O2, whereas phosphorylation of Akt in Syk-deficient cells was almost completely abolished (Fig.1 A). In contrast, when cells were exposed to high doses of H2O2 (1–5 mm), the levels of Akt phosphorylation were about the same in both the wild-type and the Syk-deficient cells (Fig. 1 B). Although phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 correlates with maximal activation of Akt (26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar), in order to confirm Akt activation, we investigated the enzymatic activity of Akt by in vitrokinase assay using histone 2B as a substrate. Consistent with the phosphorylation of Akt, the enzymatic activation of Akt by stimulation with 100 μm H2O2 was also abolished in Syk-deficient cells (Fig. 1 C). These data showed that Akt activation in B cells stimulated with low doses of H2O2 was dependent on Syk. We have previously reported that Syk was phosphorylated and activated by treatment with high doses of H2O2 (1–10 mm) (9Qin S. Inazu T. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Homma Y. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Qin S. Minami Y. Hibi M. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2098-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was also increased by treatment with 100 μm H2O2(Fig. 2 A). To further examine the role of Syk kinase activity and its autophosphorylation site in Akt activation, we analyzed the Akt phosphorylation induced by 100 μm H2O2 using Syk-deficient cells expressing kinase-negative Syk (K395R; here designated KD) or Syk having mutations in the autophosphorylation site (Y518F/Y519F, here designated Autop−). As shown in Fig. 2 B, in cells expressing KD or Autop− as well as in Syk-deficient cells, Akt phosphorylation was significantly reduced. These findings suggest that both the kinase activity and the autophosphorylation sites of Syk were required for Akt phosphorylation. PI 3-kinase is believed to be an upstream activator of Akt in growth factor-activated survival pathway (27Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that Akt is activated by oxidative stress in fibroblasts in a PI 3-kinase-dependent or -independent manner (17Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 18Konishi H. Fujiyoshi T. Fukui Y. Matsuzaki H. Yamamoto T. Ono Y. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Kikkawa U. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hence, the involvement of PI 3-kinase in oxidative stress-induced Akt activation remains controversial. Therefore, we have studied the involvement of PI 3-kinase in Syk-dependent Akt phosphorylation using B cells. Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin (100 nm, 30 min), a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, completely blocked Akt phosphorylation in B cells subsequently treated with 100 μmH2O2 (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, PI 3-kinase activity in wild-type cells is significantly increased in a H2O2 dose-dependent manner, whereas Syk-deficient cells demonstrate little increase of PI 3-kinase activity following stimulation with low doses of H2O2. These findings indicate that in B cells stimulated with low doses of H2O2 Syk activates PI 3-kinase, thereby inducing Akt activation. Akt has been shown to be a general mediator of growth factor-induced survival and to suppress cell death induced by a variety of stimuli (16Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). We have examined whether Syk was involved in suppressing oxidative stress-induced cell death. Wild-type and various mutant cells were treated with low doses of H2O2 for 22 h, and cell viability was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. About 30% of wild-type and Syk revertant cells (Syk/Syk−) died after 22 h of treatment with 100 μm H2O2, whereas more than 80% of Syk-deficient and kinase-inactive Syk (KD)-expressing cells died under similar conditions (Fig.4 A). It was obvious that the viability of Syk-deficient cells declined dramatically after exposure to H2O2. Furthermore, DNA ladder formation was detected in B cells treated with low doses of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 4 B, a deficiency of Syk produced a significantly enhanced, dose-dependent apoptotic response based on DNA fragmentation. Recently, it has been reported that Akt phosphorylates caspase-9 and inhibits its protease activity (21Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar). We therefore studied caspase-9 activity in B cells treated with 50 μmH2O2 for 12 h. It was notable that following stimulation with H2O2, caspase-9 activity in Syk-deficient cells had increased more strongly than that in wild-type cells (Fig. 5). These results suggest that Syk plays a role in the protection of B cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.Figure 5Caspase-9 activity in wild-type and Syk-deficient cells exposed to H2O2. Cells were treated with 50 μm H2O2 for 12 h at 37 °C, and cell lysates were assayed for caspase-9 activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are expressed as -fold increase in caspase-9 activity of apoptotic cells over that of noninduced cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been well established that oxidative stress induces the activation of various PTKs, subsequently leading to an increase in the cytoplasmic free calcium and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (2Schieven G.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2098-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that in B cells exposed to oxidative stress, Syk plays a crucial role in signal transduction, including Ca2+ release from intracellular pools and the activation of JNK (9Qin S. Inazu T. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Homma Y. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Qin S. Minami Y. Hibi M. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2098-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that Syk also induces PI 3-kinase activation followed by Akt activation in B cells following oxidative stress. It has been reported that Syk is upstream of PI 3-kinase in platelet activation and B cell receptor signaling (28Yanagi S. Sada K. Tohyama Y. Tsubokawa M. Nagai K. Yonezawa K. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Beitz L.O. Fruman D.A. Kurosaki T. Cantley L.C. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32662-32666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that Syk associates with PI 3-kinase and enhances its activity following thrombin stimulation in platelets (28Yanagi S. Sada K. Tohyama Y. Tsubokawa M. Nagai K. Yonezawa K. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, we could not demonstrate the association of Syk with PI 3-kinase in B cells exposed to oxidative stress, although PI 3-kinase activation was dependent on Syk. In B cell receptor signaling, Syk phosphorylates Cbl at the PI 3-kinase binding site, whereby Cbl binds PI 3-kinase, leading to activation of PI 3-kinase (29Beitz L.O. Fruman D.A. Kurosaki T. Cantley L.C. Scharenberg A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32662-32666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In oxidative stress signaling, as well as in B cell receptor signaling, some molecules such as Cbl may mediate Syk-dependent PI 3-kinase activation. Further investigation is warranted to clarify the molecular mechanism of Syk-dependent PI 3-kinase activation following oxidative stress. In this work, Syk-dependent Akt activation has been observed after treatment with low doses of H2O2(10–100 μm) but not with high doses of H2O2 (1–5 mm). The various cell lines exhibited different susceptibilities to H2O2-induced cell death, and B cells were relatively sensitive to H2O2 treatment (11Lee Y.-J. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gardner A.M. Xu F.-H. Fady C. Jacoby F.J. Duffey D.C. Tu Y. Lichtenstein A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 13Lee Y. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We have observed that DNA ladder formation, which is characteristic of apoptosis, was detectable in B cells treated with low doses of H2O2 (Fig. 4 B) but not in B cells treated with high doses of H2O2 (data not shown). Thus, high doses of H2O2 induce cell necrosis, whereas cell death induced by low doses of H2O2 seems to reflect cellular apoptosis in B cells. One prominent feature of H2O2 in cell apoptosis is to activate mitochondrial permeability transition pore and release the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c into the cytoplasm (30Stridh H. Kimland M. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. Hampton M.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, cytochrome c in combination with Apaf-1 activates caspase-9, which leads to the activation of the caspase cascade and DNA fragmentation (31Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the caspase-9 activity in Syk-deficient cells after H2O2 stimulation was higher than in wild-type cells. These observations suggest that Syk is involved in the regulation of the caspase-9 activity in oxidative stress-induced B cell apoptosis. It has been reported that Akt phosphorylates caspase-9 and inhibits its protease activity (21Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar), so we suggest that Akt, which is activated in a Syk-dependent manner following oxidative stress, inhibits caspase-9 activity. However, we could not determine whether caspase-9 was the substrate for Akt in B cells following oxidative stress. There is another possibility, that Syk modulates caspase-9 activation mediated by cytochrome c. Further studies are required to clarify the anti-apoptotic function of Syk in oxidative stress. We have previously reported that Syk is required for JNK activation in B cells stimulated with high doses of H2O2(0.5–1 mm) (10Qin S. Minami Y. Hibi M. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2098-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that JNK is activated by stressful stimuli, and a high level of JNK activity is correlated in many instances with the induction of apoptosis (32Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). However, in B cells stimulated with a low dose of H2O2 (100 μm), JNK is hardly activated (10Qin S. Minami Y. Hibi M. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2098-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspect that JNK has little if any role in B cell apoptosis induced by low doses of H2O2. In summary, our findings provide another physiological role for Syk in oxidative stress signaling. Syk induces the activation of the PI 3-kinase-Akt survival pathway following oxidative stress, thereby enhancing cell survival against oxidative stress.

Heterotrimeric G proteins contribute to these pathways by helping to conduct the flow of information from agonist-activated heptahelical receptors to a variety of intracellular targets (1Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

G proteins have traditionally been studied within the context of second messenger regulation, where adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, and ion channels assume prominent roles. A substantial amount of attention has been focused more recently on forms of transduction involving protein recruitment apart from second messenger regulation. Gβγ provides an interesting example, serving as a point of anchorage for several G protein-coupled receptor kinases (4Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L.

Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Additional documented interactions include those of Gβ and/or Gβγ with Raf-1 (6Pumiglia K.M. LeVine H.

Gα subunits also participate in protein recruitment relevant to downstream events, for example interacting with regulators of G protein signaling (RGS1 molecules), which hasten deactivation of Gα but can coordinately activate other proteins (e.g. Rho (10Kozasa T.

G proteins regulate the activity of numerous transcription factors typically through second messengers and quite often through other intermediates. The activation of the cAMP-responsive element binding protein CREB proceeds through phosphorylation by protein kinase A (16Montminy M. Annu. Rev.

In an effort to identify effectors for Gz that could play a role in hematopoietic development, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins in bone marrow cells that interact with activated Gαz. We report one such protein here, Eya2. Eya2 is a human homologue of the Drosophila eyes absent gene product and interacts not only with Gαz but at least one other member of the Gαi family, Gαi2. Eya2 in combination with Six proteins is a transcription co-activator. Gαz and Gαi2 interact with Eya2 in mammalian cells, and this interaction represses the transactivating activity of Eya2 in part by inhibiting Six4-induced translocation of Eya2 from cytosol to the nucleus. cDNAs used in this study were human Gαz (37Fong H.K.W.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Gαi2Q205L, and Gαs(Q227L). Gαz and the rat G protein subunit cDNAs were obtained from Drs. H. Fong (University of Southern California) and N. Dhanasekaran (Temple University), respectively. Eya2 and Six1 cDNAs were isolated from a human bone marrow cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by the polymerase chain reaction based on published sequences. Flag (DYKDDDDK)-tagged Eya2 was generated by insertion of the Eya2 cDNA into pFlag-CMV2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). HA (YPYDVPDYA)-tagged proteins were generated by polymerase chain reaction using forward primers encoding the HA sequence and subsequent insertion of products into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The tags in both instances were placed at the N terminus. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Eya2 () fusion protein was generated by subcloning the Eya2 () cDNA into pGEX-5x-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) immediately downstream of the GST sequence. The luciferase reporter construct for measuring Eya2/Six-mediated transcription was generated by cloning theBamHI-EheI fragment containing the adenovirus E1b TATA box from the pNFκB-Luc plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) into pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGL3-TATA; six copies of the MEF3 element (40Spitz F. Demignon J. Porteu A. Kahn A. Concordet J.P. Daegelen D. Maire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14220-14225Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) obtained by polymerase chain reaction were subcloned into pGL3-TATA upstream of the TATA box (SamI/SacII sites). The sequences of all constructs were verified directly. pAS2–1 and pM (CLONTECH) are vectors used to express Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. pVP16 (CLONTECH) is a vector used to express VP16-activating domain fusion proteins in mammalian cells. pAG2–1-Gz(Q205L) was used as a bait to screen a human bone marrow library (CLONTECH) by sequential transformation according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the yeast reporter strain Y190 was transformed with pAS2–1-Gαz(Q205L) and plated on synthetic dropout agar plates lacking tryptophan. Control experiments confirmed that this construct had no autoactivating properties. Yeast surviving the selection protocol were then transformed with pACT2 bone marrow library plasmid DNA and plated onto synthetic dropout agar plates containing 35 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma) but lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 7 days, and subsequent colonies were transferred to paper filters for measurement of β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol. Library plasmids were isolated from positive colonies and used to re-transform Y190 together with pAS2–1-Gα(Q205L) or, as a control, pAS2–1-p53 or empty plasmid to confirm strength of interaction and facilitate isolation of single library plasmids. In other experiments the N- and C-terminal regions of Eya2 were subcloned into pACT2 for analysis of interactions with GαzQ205L expressed by pAS2–1. HeLa cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded in six-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) the day before transfection. The cells were transfected with pM and pVP16 expressing the indicated proteins or with empty vectors together with pG5CAT (CLONTECH) (0.5 μg each) using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA); pG5CAT contains five copies of the Gal4 binding site and an adenovirus E1b minimal promoter upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. 0.1 μg pGL3-control, which expresses luciferase constitutively, was included as an internal control. At 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared for assays of CAT activity. GST and the GST-Eya2(269–538) fusion protein were prepared using the pGEX-5x-3 vector and Escherichia coli strain B21. [35S]GαzQ205L, Gαi2Q205L, and GαsQ227L were generated from pcDNA3 vectors byin vitro translation using a TNT T7 coupled transcription/translation system with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and [35S]methionine. 2–3 μg of individual GST fusion proteins were attached to glutathione-agarose beads (20-μl suspension) and incubated with 10 μl of the 35S-labeled subunits in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) for 2 h at 4 °C with shaking. The beads were washed 4 times with binding buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer, and heated (90 °C) for 5 min. Proteins were visualized after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by autoradiography. HeLa cells were seeded into 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) the day before transfection with 0.5 μg of the reporter gene construct pGL3-MEF3-Luc and the indicated expression plasmids (0.4 μg each); 0.01 μg of pRL-SV40 plasmid (Promega) was included as the internal control. 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). C2C12 cells were seeded into 12-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well) and transfected with 0.5 μg of each of the indicated plasmids using Transfectam (Promega). The cells were re-plated 24 h thereafter onto collagen-coated glass coverslips for an additional 24 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Blocking was performed with 5% donkey serum and 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated for 2 h with one or more of the following antibodies in blocking buffer: mouse anti-flag (M5, Sigma) at 25 μg/ml for detection of FLAG-tagged Eya2, chicken anti-HA (Aves Labs, Tigard, OR) at 1:100 for detection of HA-tagged Six4, rabbit anti-Gαi2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:100, and rabbit anti-Gαs (1191 (42Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)) at 1:100. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with one or more of the following secondary detection reagents: donkey anti-mouse-Cy5 at 1:300, anti-chicken-Cy2 at 1:100, and anti-rabbit-rhodamine at 1:75 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc. West Grove, PA). Fluorescence was analyzed by confocal microscopy. In an attempt to identify novel effectors for Gz, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a constitutively active variant of Gαz, GαzQ205L (GαzQL), as bait and a human bone marrow cDNA library (3.5 million independent clones) as a source of interacting proteins; the Q205L mutation impairs the GTPase activity of Gαz (43Wong Y.H. Federman A. Pace A.M. Zachary I. Evans T. Pouysségur J. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Sixteen positive clones were isolated in our screen from approximately 20 million transformants. Sequencing revealed that five of the clones were the Gαi-interacting protein GAIP (44De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The other 11 clones corresponded to Eya2, a human homologue of the Drosophila eyes absent (Eya) gene. Eya is a transcription co-activator that, as a complex with the sine oculis gene product So, is essential for eye specification and the development of other tissues in Drosophila (45Bonini N.M. Leiserson W.M. Benzer S. Cell. 1993; 72: 379-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 46Pignoni F. Hu B. Zavitz K.H. Xiao J. Garrity P.A. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1997; 91: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Eya2 is one of four vertebrate forms of Eya (47Xu P.-X. Woo I. Her H. Beier D.R. Maas R.L. Development. 1997; 124: 219-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Borsani G. Degrandi A. Ballabio A. Bulfone A. Bernard L. Banfi S. Gattuso C. Mariani M. Dixon M. Donnai D. Metcalfe K. Winter R. Robertson M. Aston R. Brown A. van Heyningen V. Hanson I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Eya2 clones contained two different lengths of inserts, one corresponding to amino acid residues 15–538 and the other to residues 141–538. Full-length Eya2 is 538 residues long and comprises N-terminal transactivation () and C-terminal “Eya” consensus () domains (Fig. 1). To locate the Gαz binding site on Eya2, the N- and C-terminal portions of Eya2 (residues 15–300 and 269–538, respectively) were fused to the Gal4 activation domain and re-tested in yeast with GαzQL again fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The C-terminal half of Eya2 alone was found to interact with GαzQL. To confirm the interaction between GαzQL and full-length Eya2 in mammalian cells and to test the specificity of the interaction, we employed a mammalian two-hybrid system. The constitutively active forms of Gαz (GαzQ205L), Gαi2(Gαi2Q205L), and Gαs(GαsQ227L), as well as wild type Gαz and Gαi2 were cloned into the Gal4 DNA binding domain vector pM, and the full-length Eya2 was cloned into the VP16 transcription-activating domain vector pVP16. The two expression plasmids were co-transfected into HeLa cells together with a pG5CAT reporter construct. We found that GαzQL and Gαi2QL interacted strongly with Eya2, as determined by CAT expression, whereas GαsQL did not (Fig.2, panel A). Wild type Gαz and Gαi2 subunits, which would assume an inactive conformation predominantly, interacted with Eya2 only very weakly. These data suggest that Eya2 is specific for the activated forms of the two Gαi family members. We generated a GST-Eya2 C-terminal domain fusion protein to ascertain in pull-down experiments whether the interaction of Eya2 with GαzQL and Gαi2QL was direct (Fig. 2,panel B). In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled GαzQL, Gαi2QL, and GαsQL were incubated with the Eya2 fusion protein attached to glutathione-agarose beads. GαzQL and Gαi2QL, but not GαsQL, bound the fusion protein. Similar experiments were performed with lysates of human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with expression plasmids for wild type Gαz and GαzQL. Consistent with the experiments using in vitro translated subunits, GαzQL but not wild type Gαz bound Eya2 (data not shown). These results are in agreement with those of the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid experiments and support a direct interaction of GαzQL and Gαi2QL with Eya2. Eya2 also interacts with “Six” proteins, which are mammalian homologues of So and are reported to promote translocation of Eya2 to the nucleus (49Ohto H. Kamada S. Tago K. Tominaga S.-I. Ozaki H. Sato S. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6815-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The Six proteins consist of a Six consensus domain near the N terminus, an adjacent homeodomain, and a variable C terminus, which in some instances (e.g. Six4) contains a transactivation domain (Fig. 3, panel A). We carried out a mammalian two-hybrid assay to confirm the interaction between Eya2 and Six proteins using Six1 as the representative (panel B); Six1 had not been evaluated previously. Six1 and the isolated consensus Six domain, both presented as Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins, interacted with Eya2. We also evaluated interactions using a reporter gene (luciferase) under control of a MEF3/TATA promoter. Six proteins alone, to some extent, but the combination of Six proteins with Eya2, to a much greater relative extent, promoted gene expression (panel C); the combination of Six4 and Eya2 was particularly effective in this regard. We asked whether Six1 and Six4 have any effect on the interaction of Eya2 with GαQL subunits, and vice versa. The mammalian two-hybrid assay was performed using GαzQL and Gαi2QL subunits fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and Eya2 fused to the VP16 activation domain; Six1 and Six4 under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter were also introduced (Fig.4, panel A). As shown, both Six1 and Six4 suppressed the interaction of the GαQL subunits with Eya2. Six1 and Six4 had no effect on the interaction of p53 with the SV40 large T antigen presented as DNA binding and activation domain fusion proteins (not shown), supporting specificity of the inhibition. In the converse experiment, disruption of interactions between Six and Eya2 fusion proteins using GαzQL or Gαi2QL was modest (∼20%; not shown), due possibly to the transport of the Eya2 fusion protein independently to the nucleus by an inserted nuclear localization signal. We pursued the issue of competition through two additional assays, reporter gene activity and immunofluorescence microscopy. As noted above, Six4 and Eya2, when co-expressed, stimulated MEF3/TATA-controlled reporter gene activity by approximately 500-fold (Fig. 4, panel B; see also Fig. 3). We found that GαzQL and Gαi2QL suppressed the Six4/Eya2-promoted activity by 80%; GαsQL did not but, rather, enhanced activity to some extent. GαzQL and Gαi2QL therefore achieved a substantial inhibition of Six-promoted Eya2 regulation within the context of reporter gene expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the majority of Eya2 introduced alone into C2 myoblasts is present in the cytoplasm (Fig.5, panel A). Eya2 introduced into human embryonic kidney 293 cells partitioned into the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction (data not shown). When co-expressed with Six1 (not shown) or Six4 (panel B), Eya2 was found mostly in the nucleus. These data are consistent with the conclusion that Six proteins promote nuclear translocation of Eya proteins (49Ohto H. Kamada S. Tago K. Tominaga S.-I. Ozaki H. Sato S. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6815-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The appearance of Eya2 in the nucleus, however, was attenuated by Gαi2QL (panel C). In an analysis of Six4 and Gαi2QL distribution specifically, we found that Six4 assumed a nuclear location regardless of Eya2 and/or Gαi2QL expression and that the distributions of Eya2 and Gαi2QL, when expressed together, were indistinguishable and similar to that of either expressed alone (data not shown). The association of Gα subunits, including Gαi2 (50Berven L.A. Crouch M.F. Katsis F. Kemp B.E. Harland L.M. Barritt G.J. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with internal structures has been noted previously. GαsQL did not inhibit translocation of Eya2 (panel D). Gαi2QL therefore inhibits Six4-promoted translocation of Eya2 to the nucleus, as it does Six4-promoted transactivating activity of Eya2 in MEF3/TATA reporter gene assays. Heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in the regulation of numerous transcription factors. In many instances the regulation is achieved through the manipulation of effector-controlled second messengers, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, and/or low molecular weight G proteins. We report here that at least two members of the Gαi family, Gαz and Gαi2, interact directly with the transcription co-activator Eya2. This interaction resembles that of G proteins with other effectors, as the subunits must assume an active conformation for the interaction to occur and the functionality of the target, Eya2, to be altered. Gαz and Gαi2specifically inhibit the interaction of Eya2 with Six proteins and, thus, attenuate the import of Eya2 into the nucleus and subsequent activation of gene expression through the MEF3/TATA promoter element. Drosophila Eya is the founding member of the Eya family. InDrosophila eye specification, Eya is required for cell proliferation in the undifferentiated epithelium of the imaginal disc, subsequent initiation and propagation of the morphogenetic furrow, and neuronal development (53Bonini N.M. Choi K.-W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Eya normally acts as a complex with thesine oculis gene product So, where So as a homeodomain protein provides targeting through its DNA binding function, whereas Eya provides transactivation functionality (46Pignoni F.

Cell. 1997; 91: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Eya2, the subject of this study, has the capacity to bind Six1 and Six4, among other mammalian homologs of So, and the resultant complexes activate the myogenin gene (49Ohto H. Kamada S. Tago K. Tominaga S.-I. Ozaki H. Sato S. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6815-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We have corroborated the interaction between Eya2 and Six proteins by means of a mammalian two-hybrid system. Using a concatomeric MEF3/TATA reporter gene, we also demonstrated that Eya2 and Six proteins act cooperatively in transactivation. Our interest in Eya2 was prompted by identification of Eya2 cDNA sequences in a yeast two-hybrid screen with GαzQL as bait. Eya2 was one of two proteins identified in the screen; the other was GAIP (44De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 199"

The structure of thioredoxins has been determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR from various organisms, including pro- and eukaryotes. All have a conserved succession of secondary structures β1, α1, β2, α2, β3, α3, β4, β5, and α4, forming a central core of strands of β sheets surrounded by four α helices. The redox active center is located between the β2 sheet and the α2 helix in a protruding motif. Higher plants present three thioredoxin types, all encoded by the nuclear genome. Thioredoxins f and m are chloroplastic proteins, whereas thioredoxins h are cytosolic. In Arabidopsis thaliana each type is represented by a small gene family. Five thioredoxins h have been detected in this plant, three of which have the unusual active site sequence WCPPC (2Rivera-Madrid R. Mestres D. Marinho P. Jacquot J.P. Decottignies P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5620-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple thioredoxins in the same compartment poses the problem of their functional redundancy or specificity (3Jacquot J.P. Lancelin J.M. Meyer Y. New Phytol. 1997; 136: 543-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Meyer Y. Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 388-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two genes encoding cytosolic thioredoxins with redundant functions: the single mutants have the same characteristics as the wild type, but the simultaneous disruption of the two genes, yTRX1 and yTRX2, leads to a complex set of phenotypic effects, including modifications of the cell cycle, inability to assimilate sulfate, perturbation in methionine sulfoxide reduction, and increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (5Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of each Arabidopsis thioredoxin h in the yeast double mutant leads to a normal cell cycle and the ability to reduce methionine sulfoxide, but only the expression of AtTRX2 allows the yeast mutant to grow in the absence of organic sulfur, whereas expression of AtTRX3 (or AtTRX4 to a lesser extend) induces a higher H2O2 tolerance (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This specificity of complementation suggests that structural domains of thioredoxins are responsible for interactions with several targets. To locate the determinants of specificity, we have constructed hybrid proteins between AtTRX2 and AtTRX3 and tested their ability to complement the different phenotypes of the delta yTRX1 deltayTRX2 yeast mutant. In addition, whereas AtTRX2 presents a classical active site WCGPC, AtTRX3 has the unusual site WCPPC. It has been reported that the nature of the two amino acids between the two cysteines plays a major role in the redox potential of the active site of thioredoxins and related proteins (7Chivers P.T. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15810-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus we have tested the possible involvement of this unusual active site WCPPC in the functional specificity of AtTRX3. The yeast S. cerevisiae strainEMY63 used in this study was derived from a previous study (8Muller E.G. Yeast. 1992; 8: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EMY63 is the standard thioredoxin double mutant (MATa, trx1::TRP1,trx2::LEU2, ade2-1,ade3-100, trp1-1, leu2-3,lys2::HIS3, ura3-1, his3-11,can1-100). The strains of Escherichia coli used are DH5α for cloning and BL21(DE3) for production of recombinant proteins. Standard and minimum media were prepared as described by Sherman et al. (9Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). The B medium is sulfate free and was made according to Cherest and Surdin-Kerjan (10Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Genetics. 1992; 130: 51-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with addition of 0.3 mm adenine, 7 mm lysine, 1.3 mmhistidine, and 0.1 mm methionine or methionine sulfoxide. YNB-R and YNB-RG are YNB-Difco media with addition of adenine, lysine, and histidine at the same concentration as B medium, 0.1 mmmethionine and 2% raffinose (YNB-R) or 1% raffinose and 2% galactose (YNB-RG). EMY63 cells-expressing yeast yTRX1, A. thaliana AtTRX2, and AtTRX3 proteins were obtained from Mouahebet al. (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mutated thioredoxins were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis by overlap extension using PCR1 (11Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6768) Google Scholar), cloned into the pGEMT plasmid (Promega). The oligonucleotides used in this work are listed in Table I. Oligonucleotides Attrx3f 5→3, Attrx2f 3→5, Attrx3Mlu, and Attrx2Bam (Attrx2f 5→3, Attrx3f 3→5, Attrx2Mlu, and Attrx3Bam) were used to obtained the construct Attrx3/2(Attrx2/3), which is a fusion of the 5′-side ofAtTRX3 (AtTRX2) from the start codon to the excluded active center, and the 3′-side of AtTRX2(AtTRX3), from the included active center to the stop codon.Attrx2/3 is the opposite hybrid.Table IOligonucleotides used for mutagenesis of thioredoxin open reading framesNameSequence (5′→3)T m 1-aT m, melting temperature.°CAttrx3MluGCACGCGTATGGCCGCAGAAGGAG80Attrx3BamTTTGGATCCTCAAGCAGCACG64Attrx3NdeAAGCATATGGCCGCAGAAGGAGAAG76Attrx2MluGCACGCGTATGGAGGAGCTTTATC74Attrx2BamAACGGATCCTTATGCTCTGAG62Attrx2NdeCGCATATGGGAGGAGCTTTAT62trx2PP5→3GCTTCATGGTGTCCACCATGTCG62trx2PP3→5CGACATGGTGGACACCATGAAGC62trx2GP5→3GCTTCATGGTGTGGACCATGTCG62trx2GP3→5CGACATGGTCCACACCATGAAGC62trx3GP5→3GCTTCATGGTGTGGACCATGTCGTTTCATTGCACCCG114trx3GP3→5GGTCCACACCATGAAGCAGTGAAGTCTATCAC96trx3PP5→3GCTTCATGGTGTCCACCATGTCGTTTCATTGCACCCG114trx3PP3→5GGTGGACACCATGAAGCAGTGAAGTCTATCAC96Attrx3f5→3TGGTGCCCACCTTGCCG58Attrx3f3→5TGGTCCGCACCATGTTGCAGTG70Attrx2f5→3TGGTGCGGACCATGTAGG58Attrx2f3→5CGGCAAGGTGGGCACCATGAGGCCGA881-a T m, melting temperature. Open table in a new tab To obtain thioredoxins mutated in their active site, we used oligonucleotides trx2GP 5→3, trx2GP 3→5, trx2PP 5→3, and trx2PP 3→5 for AtTRX2 and trx3GP 5→3, trx3GP 3→5, trx3PP 5→3, and trx3PP 3→5 for AtTRX3 designed to hybridize on the active center. Attrx3Mlu or Attrx3Nde, Attrx3Bam, Attrx2Mlu or Attrx2Nde, and Attrx2Bam were used to introduce MluI or NdeI, and BamHI restriction sequences at both extremities of constructs. PCR products were cloned in pGEM-T plasmid (Promega), subcloned in pET16b plasmid (Novagen) with NdeI andBamHI restriction sequences to produce proteins in E. coli, and in Ycp2, with MluI and BamHI restriction sequences for expression in yeast under GAL1promoter control. The autonomously replicating sequence centromeric plasmid Ycp2 (12Cole G.M. Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) contains the URA3 gene as a selectable marker and the GAL1 promoter for conditional expression of thioredoxin (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Each construction was entirely sequenced, and PCR was carried out to check for correct transformation. To overproduce hybrid thioredoxins in E. coli, BL21(DE3) strains were cotransformed with pSBET (13Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbib H.H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 196-198PubMed Google Scholar) and pET16b containing constructs, grown in 100 ml of liquid B medium up toA 600 nm = 0.5, when production was induced by addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were then pelleted and stored at −80 °C. S. cerevisiae was transformed after a lithium chloride treatment as described by Ito et al. (14Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxins were expressed in yeast as described by Mouaheb et al. (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were first grown in YNB-R medium and then in YNB-RG medium to induce the transcription of the thioredoxin gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Exponentially growing cells were pelleted and stored at −80 °C. Total protein extractions from yeast as well as from bacteria were performed using a hydraulic press (Carver, model 3968) as described by Verdoucq et al. (15Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, about 1 μg of total bacterial proteins and 60 μg of total yeast proteins from each extract were used. The procedure was as described by Mouaheb et al. (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Antibodies were visualized with ECL+ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-thioredoxin antibodies were produced as described by Mouaheb et al. (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To test methionine sulfoxide assimilation, the transformed cells were grown on liquid B medium with methionine sulfoxide (0.1 mm) as sole sulfur source, and absorbance was measured at 600 nm. To test sulfate assimilation or H2O2 tolerance, cells were first grown in YNB-RG medium to a density of about 107 cells per ml and then diluted in the same medium to four differentA 600 nm ranging from 0.2 to 2 × 10−4. 15 μl of each dilution was plated on YNB-RG agar medium with or without 0.1 mm methionine. H2O2 tolerance was tested in the medium containing 0.1 mm methionine and different H2O2 concentrations as indicated in the text. Plates were then incubated 3–4 days at 29 °C. Flow cytometry was used as described by Mouaheb et al. (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) for determination of the cell cycle parameters, except that the medium was YNB-RG. AtTRX2 and AtTRX3 were modeled using Swiss-PdbViewer v3.5 (16Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 15: 2714-2723Crossref Scopus (9389) Google Scholar) with the closest structure to the average of the NMR ensemble (1tof.pdb; 17) as a template structure. Forty model structures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii thioredoxin h containing a proline instead of a glycine in the redox active site (WCPPC instead of WCGPC) were obtained using version 4.0 of the MODELLER program (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10277) Google Scholar) using the same template structure. As shown in Fig. 1 the N-terminal parts of plant and yeast thioredoxins are very divergent, whereas the C-terminal parts show high similarities. To localize the structural determinants responsible for the functional specificity of AtTRX2 and AtTRX3 in yeast, we first built hybrid proteins between AtTRX2 and AtTRX3 and then produced both proteins inE. coli to test the usefulness of the anti-AtTRX2 and anti-AtTRX3 sera for the detection of the hybrid proteins. The hybrid constructions were introduced into the shuttle vector Ycp2 and the yeast thioredoxin double mutant transformed with these vectors. The presence of the hybrid proteins and the effects on the four aspects of the phenotype were tested in the recombinant yeast. In a second set of experiments, we have estimated the possible role of the atypical active site WCPPC on the specificity of these thioredoxins by introducing G33P or P33G mutations in AtTRX2 and AtTRX3, respectively. A sketch of the different thioredoxin constructs is included in Fig.2. The amino acids are numbered according to their position in respect to E. coli sequence. Hybrid constructs were obtained by interchanging the N-side and the C-side of AtTRX2 and AtTRX3, taking the splitting point at the tryptophan Trp-31 of the conserved active site. Thus, Attrx2/3 is constituted by the N-side of AtTRX2, the active center of AtTRX3 and its C-side. Attrx3/2 is the complementary construct. The constructs were first cloned in the plasmid pET16b allowing overexpression in E. coli. Both hybrids are abundantly expressed in E. coli and are easily detected by staining. Attrx3/2 is detected mainly in the supernatant, whereas most Attrx2/3 is still present in the pellet (not shown). The serum raised against AtTRX3 detects Attrx2/3 and with a lower efficiency Attrx3/2. However, the serum raised against AtTRX2 revealed only Attrx3/2 (not shown). Hybrid constructs were then cloned in the shuttle vector Ycp2 under the control of the promoter GAL1 and were introduced in the yeast double mutant Δtrx1,Δtrx2. Immunoblot analyses against yeast total protein extracts were carried out using antibody raised against AtTRX3, to check for the presence of hybrid proteins in yeast. As shown in Fig.3, Attrx3/2 was detected by antibody raised against AtTRX2, whereas Attrx2/3 was undetected, suggesting that this hybrid protein is not synthesized or is unstable in yeast. Four phenotypic aspects were analyzed in theΔtrx1,Δtrx2 double disrupted EMY63 yeast cells transformed by the hybrid constructs: methionine sulfoxide assimilation, cell cycle parameters, H2O2tolerance, and sulfate assimilation (5Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As shown previously (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) expression of each Arabidopsisthioredoxin h is able to restore a normal cell cycle in the presence of methionine and rapid growth on methionine sulfoxide as sole sulfur source. The hybrid construct Attrx2/3 was inefficient for both aspects. Therefore, considering the absence of detection by antibodies, we concluded that the hybrid Attrx2/3 protein was not produced at an adequate level or in a correct structural conformation in yeast to be active. Because of this, we focused on phenotypic aspects of the yeast thioredoxin mutant expressing the Attrx3/2 hybrid. Yeasts expressing Attrx3/2 were capable of growing on methionine sulfoxide in the particular synthetic medium (B medium) that is completely devoid of other sulfur source. Double mutant cells transformed with the empty Ycp2 showed only residual growth on methionine sulfoxide, whereas cells expressing Attrx3/2 grew with a mean generation time equivalent to that of cells expressing yTRX1, AtTRX2, or AtTRX3 (Table II). The cell cycle of the thioredoxin double mutant yeast growing in the presence of methionine is abnormal, with a lengthened S phase and no G1phase (5Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing any of the A. thalianathioredoxin h genes displayed a normal cell cycle (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The DNA content of the transformed yeast was then analyzed by flow cytometry, and the results are reported in Fig. 4. The cell cycle of yeast mutant expressing Attrx3/2 was almost normal showing a clear G1 phase. These results demonstrate that the hybrid protein Attrx3/2 is able to confer to the EMY63 mutant growth properties conferred by other thioredoxins h.Table IIMean generation times (G.T.) of the Δtrx1, Δtrx2 yeast EMY63 transformed by the empty plasmid Ycp2 or by different thioredoxin constructs in this plasmidEMY63Ycp2yTRX1AtTRX3AtTRX2Attrx3/2hG.T233344Cells were grown on B medium with methionine sulfoxide (0.1 mm) as sole sulfur source.

Absorbance was measured at 600 nm in a Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer. The mutant EMY63 was unable to grow on sulfate, whereas expression of AtTRX2 in the yeast mutant cells restored sulfate assimilation. Expression of AtTRX3 did not. Cells expressing Attrx3/2 were able to grow in the absence of organic sulfur (Fig.5) showing that all information conferring sulfate assimilation is present in the C-terminal part of the molecule. Another aspect of the yeast thioredoxin mutant phenotype is its increased sensitivity to oxidants such as H2O2. Indeed, the yeast thioredoxin mutant could not grow in the presence of H2O2 at concentrations higher than 0.5 mm (not shown). To verify the capacity of transformed cells to tolerate hydrogen peroxide, the yeast cells were plated on media containing different concentrations of H2O2, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mm. As previously shown (6Mouaheb N. Thomas D. Verdoucq L. Monfort P. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), expression of AtTRX3 allowed yeast cells to grow in the presence of 1 mm H2O2, whereas yeast expressing AtTRX2 had the same tolerance to H2O2 as the mutant (0.5 mm). Cells expressing Attrx3/2 were able to tolerate concentration of H2O2 of 0.7–0.8 mm, which is higher than that tolerated by cells expressing AtTRX2 (not shown). Therefore, this hybrid protein is associated with the preventive process of hydrogen peroxide damages suggesting that the N-terminal part of AtTRX3 contains some of the information necessary to induce H2O2 tolerance, or alternatively, that the N-terminal part of AtTRX2 masks determinants already present in the C-terminal part of AtTRX2. The 40 calculated models of C. reinhardtiithioredoxin h with a WCPPC active site indicate that a Pro residue can most probably occupy a single conformation that does not disrupt any of the fine geometry of the thioredoxin active site (17Mittard V. Blackledge M.J. Stein M. Jacquot J.P. Marion D. Lancelin J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Gly→Pro mutation would simply expose the side chain of Pro to the solvent making the direct environment of the reactive cysteine 32 more hydrophobic while the active sulfur of the same Cys becomes more sterically hindered (Fig. 6). The possibility of hydrogen bond formation between the solvent-exposed amide proton of the Gly in the redox site of WCGPC-type thioredoxins and their substrates also disappeared in WCPPC-type thioredoxins. A. thaliana thioredoxin AtTRX3 has an unusual active site sequence WCPPC. The presence of a proline instead of the usual glycine has an influence on the redox potential, as described by Chivers et al. (7Chivers P.T. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15810-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and may change the accessibility to the cysteines of the redox active site. This may play a role in the functional specificity of the cytoplasmic thioredoxins. This prompted us to test the ability of AtTRX2 or AtTRX3 variants with a mutated active site to complement the yeast thioredoxin mutant for the four phenotypic aspects described above. We chose to proceed in two steps, obtaining first variants of AtTRX2 and AtTRX3with almost identical nucleotide sequences around the active site differing only by the two nucleotides of the proline (CCa) and glycine (GGa) codons. These variants will be useful in further studies and are used in this study to control the effect of changing some codon use. Two pairs of primers were designed encoding the protein sequences: primer 1, ASWCGPCR and primer 2, ASWCPPCR (Table I). The use of primer 1 to modifyAtTRX2 produced a variant named Attrx2GP, differing from AtTRX2 by two nucleotides but encoding exactly the same protein. The use of primer 2 to modifyAtTRX3 produced the variant Attrx3PP with four nucleotide changes, encoding a T30S mutated protein. The desired P33G or G33P mutations were obtained in a second step by using primer 1 to modify AtTRX3 producing Attrx3GP and by using primer 2 to modify AtTRX2 producing Attrx2PP. The four constructs were inserted into the Ycp2 plasmid then introduced into the yeast double thioredoxin mutant, and the phenotype was tested. We verified the expression and stability of the new proteins Attrx2GP, Attrx2PP, Attrx3GP, and Attrx3PP by immunoblot analysis (not shown). Each protein was detected by the appropriated antibody, but the quantities of mutated proteins present in yeast cells were lower than quantities of AtTRX2 or AtTRX3, probably because of an unfavorable codon usage. Concerning the reduction of methionine sulfoxide and cell cycle parameters, the efficiency of AtTRX2 and AtTRX3 seemed unchanged. Indeed, the mean generation time of cells expressing Attrx2GP, Attrx2PP, Attrx3GP, or Attrx3PP growing on methionine sulfoxide medium was slightly longer than that of cells expressing AtTRX2 or AtTRX3 (Table III). Cell cycles of yeast transformed with mutated thioredoxins were almost normal, showing a G1 phase (Fig. 7). The lower number of cells in G1 compared with the cells transformed by plasmids expressing the wild type thioredoxins may be directly related to the lower levels of proteins present in the cells. Cells expressing Attrx3-GP or Attrx3-PP could tolerate concentrations of H2O2 up to 0.8 mm (not shown), whereas yeast transformed by Attrx2GP or Attrx2PPwere unable to grow in the presence of H2O2 at concentrations higher than 0.5 mm, as observed for cells expressing AtTRX2 or no thioredoxin. The concentrations tolerated by cells expressing Attrx3GP or Attrx3PP are slightly lower than those tolerated by cells expressing AtTRX3, the differences being directly related to the lower levels of proteins present in cells.Table IIIMean generation times (G.T.) of the Δtrx1, Δtrx2 yeast EMY63 transformed by the empty plasmid Ycp2 or by different thioredoxin constructs in this plasmidEMY63Ycp2YTRX1AtTRX3AtTRX2Attrx3PPAttrx3GPAttrx2GPAttrx2PPhG.T.233344455Cells were grown on B medium with methionine sulfoxide (0.1 mM) as sole sulfur source.

Absorbance was measured at 600 nm in a Uvikon 930 spectrometer. Growth of cells expressing the mutated Attrx2GP or Attrx2PP proteins on organic sulfur free medium was equivalent to that of cells expressing AtTRX2 (Fig. 8). Cells expressing AtTRX3 or Attrx3-PP did not grow on medium devoid of organic sulfur source. In contrast, the expression of Attrx3-GP allowed cells to grow on this medium (Fig. 8). Thus the mutation P33G conferred a gain of function to AtTRX3, enabling this protein to participate in sulfate assimilation.

This stable conformation is conserved among all thioredoxin structures from prokaryotes, mammals, and eukaryotic algae that have been determined so far (1Holmgren A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mittard V. Blackledge M.J. Stein M. Jacquot J.P. Marion D. Lancelin J.M. Eur. J.

However, expression in the yeast double mutant has shown thatArabidopsis thioredoxins h are able to complement only a limited and in part different set of functions than those that are controlled in the wild type by the two redundant endogenous yeast thioredoxins. In other words, both yeast thioredoxins interact with several targets implicated in different independent processes, whereas the cytoplasmic A. thaliana thioredoxins are active only on some of the yeast thioredoxin targets. An explanation for this specificity cannot be found in the conserved global structure of thioredoxins but rather in residues on the protein surface. On the basis of the sequences, a simple hypothesis consisted in suspecting the less conserved N-terminal part of plant thioredoxins (Fig. 1) to play an important role in the specificity. Thus, we decided to build two chimerical thioredoxins between AtTRX2 and AtTRX3, interchanging the N and C sides of both thioredoxins, by taking the splitting point at the tryptophan, which precedes the first cysteine of the active center. The construct Attrx2/3 appears to encode a protein that is not able to take a normal conformation in E. coli resulting in insolubility and which is not synthesized or not stable inSaccharomyces. Lopez-Jaramillo et al. (22Lopez-Jaramillo J. Chueca A. Sahrawy M. Lopez-Gorge J. Plant J. 1998; 15: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) reported similar results for hybrid proteins constructed between different types of chloroplastic thioredoxins. In both cases computer modeling indicated that these sequences are compatible with a normal stable thioredoxin folding. Most probably, they are blocked at an intermediate step during the folding process and consequently do not reach the final folding stage. In contrast, the hybrid protein Attrx3/2 is fully soluble in E. coli and accumulates in Saccharomyces, thus allowing further studies. The first result from the complementation of EMY63 by the Attrx3/2 is that our assumption on the role of the N-terminal part as determinant of the specificity was wrong, because all determinants for sulfate assimilation are present in the C-terminal part of AtTRX2. Nevertheless an anti-oxidant activity is associated with the N-terminal part of AtTRX3. This suggests that the domains necessary for the interaction with different target proteins are not located at the same place on the thioredoxin molecules. Qin et al. (23Qin J. Clore G.M.

A particularity of some plant thioredoxins h is the presence of the atypical site WCPPC. It has been demonstrated that the redox activity of the active center depends on amino acid residues situated between the two cysteines (7Chivers P.T. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15810-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For example, the disulfide isomerase DsbA fromE. coli belongs to the thioredoxin family. Its structure is similar to that of thioredoxin (25Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), but its active center CPHC is oxidant, whereas that of thioredoxin, CGPC, is reductive (26Gane P.J. Freedman R.B. Warwicker A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In AtTRX3, the single mutation P33G allows the molecule to support sulfate assimilation, suggesting that the presence of the proline hinders interaction with the protein target(s) implicated in sulfate assimilation. The vicinity of the reactive cysteine 32, which is more hydrophobic and less accessible in WCPPC relative to WCGPC-type thioredoxin, could significantly change the Cys reactivity, its apparent pK a, and possibly the redox potential (7Chivers P.T. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15810-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the presence of the proline at position 33 in AtTRX2 is not the only characteristic that hinders sulfate assimilation. Indeed, the mutation P33G only allows a slow growth rate on sulfate medium. In addition the G33P mutation in AtTRX2 does not modify its ability to induce sulfate assimilation. Scrutiny of AtTRX2 and AtTRX3 three-dimensional models reveals that the closest differences in the vicinity of the active site are located in the helix II of thioredoxins about 7 to 15 Å away from the reactive sulfur: in AtTRX2, positions +4 and +8 relative to the last cysteine of the active site (WCXPC) are Glu and His. In AtTRX3 these positions are occupied by two alanines (Fig.6). These positions are partially exposed to the solvent and could therefore be involved in the transitory thioredoxin-substrate complexes. Overall, AtTRX3 appears less charged and less hydrophobic, whereas AtTRX2 has the most polar active site neighborhood, which may explain the differences of activity of the mutated active centers. Presently, the thioredoxin targets responsible for H2O2 tolerance and sulfate assimilation are not definitely established. Nevertheless, peroxiredoxins are likely to be implicated in the thioredoxin-dependent tolerance to H2O2. The three yeast peroxiredoxins TSA, YDR453C, and YLR109 accumulate at a higher level in H2O2-treated yeasts (29Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and genetic (30Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and biochemical (31Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) evidence shows that YLR109 is not reduced by glutathione or glutaredoxin whereas TSA and YDR453C are. In addition we have previously isolated a disulfide-bridged complex between AtTRX3 and YLR109 (15Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus the hypersensitivity of EMY63, which lacks thioredoxins but still has glutathione and glutaredoxin, is most likely due to the failure to reduce YLR109. The complete absence of growth on sulfate may be due to the absence of reduction of the adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) by PAPS reductase, the sole enzyme of sulfate assimilation that is directly dependent on a disulfide reduction for activity. Nevertheless, in E. coliglutaredoxins and thioredoxins act as electron donors to PAPS reductase (32Lillig C.H. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Aslund F. Ritz D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7695-7698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae PAPS reductase may be more specifically reduced by thioredoxin, or alternatively, the inability of EMY63 to assimilate sulfate may be an indirect consequence of the redox state of these cells. From an evolutionary point of view, the clearest result (Table IV) is that, starting with thioredoxins with restricted activity spectra, we have produced thioredoxins with a larger activity spectrum by two independent methods: Attrx3/2 has full activity for sulfate assimilation and gains some antioxidant activity; Attrx3GP has full antioxidant activity and gains some ability to induce sulfate assimilation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a common origin of plant thioredoxins h from a totipotent ancestor. After gene duplications, mutations appeared that masked some determinants necessary for the interaction with particular targets and resulting in a specialization of the plant thioredoxins h.

https://openalex.org/W2054489908,"Ionizing radiation (IR) treatment results in activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl because of phosphorylation by ATM. In vitro evidence indicates that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) can also phosphorylate and thus potentially activate Abl kinase activity in response to IR exposure. To unravel the role of ATM and DNA-PK in the activation of Abl, we assayed Abl, ATM, and DNA-PK activity in ATM- and DNA-PKcs-deficient cells after irradiation. Our results show that despite the presence of higher than normal levels of DNA-PK kinase activity, c-Abl fails to become activated after IR exposure in ATM-deficient cells. Conversely, normal activation of both ATM and c-Abl occurs in DNA-PKcs-deficient cells, indicating that ATM but not DNA-PK is required for activation of Abl in response to IR treatment. Moreover, activation of Abl kinase activity by IR correlates well with activation of ATM activity in all phases of the cell cycle. These results indicate that ATM is primarily responsible for activation of Abl in response to IR exposure in a cell cycle-independent fashion. Examination of DNA-PK activity in response to IR treatment in Abl-deficient cells expressing mutant forms of Abl or in normal cells exposed to an inhibitor of Abl suggests an in vivo role for Abl in the down-regulation of DNA-PK activity. Collectively, these results suggest a convergence of the ATM and DNA-PK pathways in the cellular response to IR through c-Abl kinase."

Apart from the differences in the regulatory domain, the catalytic domain of aPKCι differs considerably from other known kinases, because it contains a modification within the glycine-rich loop motif (GXGXXG) that is found in the nucleotide-binding fold of virtually all nucleotide-binding proteins including PKCs, Ras, adenylate kinase, and the mitochondrial F1-ATPase. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis to investigate whether these sequence differences affect the nucleotide binding properties and catalytic activity of aPKCι. When lysine 274, a residue essential for ATP binding and activity conserved in most protein kinases, was replaced by arginine (K274R mutant), aPKCι retained its normal kinase activity. This is in sharp contrast to results published for any other PKC or even distantly related kinases like phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ, where the same mutation completely abrogated the kinase activity. Furthermore, the sensitivity of aPKCι for inhibition by GF109203X, a substance acting on the ATP-binding site, was not altered in the K274R mutant. In contrast, replacement of Lys-274 by tryptophan (K274W) completely abolished the kinase activity of PKCι. In accordance with results obtained with other kinase-defective PKC mutants, in cultured cells aPKCι-K274W acted in a dominant negative fashion on signal transduction pathways involving endogenous aPKCι, whereas the effect of the catalytically active K274R mutant was identical to the wild type enzyme. In summary, aPKCι differs from classical and novel PKCs also in the catalytic domain.

Based on structural similarities and cofactor requirements they have been grouped into three subfamilies: 1) the classical or conventional PKCs (cPKCα, β1, β2 and γ), activated by Ca2+, diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine; 2) the novel PKCs (nPKCδ, ε, η, and θ), independent of Ca2+ but still responsive to diacylglycerol; and 3) the atypical PKCs (aPKCζ and λ/ι, where PKCλ is the mouse homologue of human PKCι). aPKCs differ significantly from all other PKC family members in their regulatory domain in that they lack both the calcium-binding domain and one of the two zinc finger motifs required for diacylglycerol binding (reviewed in Ref. 23Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These differences lead to a different requirement of cofactors for activation; aPKCs are insensitive to Ca2+ and diacylglycerol and exhibit an elevated basal enzymatic activity. Instead of Ca2+ and lipids there exist several protein regulators like λ-interacting protein and ζ-interacting protein, both activators of aPKCs, and PAR-4 (prostate apoptosis response), an inhibitor of aPKCs (24Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar,25Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6169-6191Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the regulatory domain of PKCs seems to serve essential regulatory functions, constructs with mutations within the regulatory domain rendering the PKC isoenzymes constitutively active still maintain their in vivo selectivity that must in part reside within the catalytic domain. However, although the isoenzyme-specific differences in the regulatory domain and their role in the activation of the three different PKC subfamilies are well understood, little is known about the functional implication of the subtle structural differences in the catalytic domain. The catalytic domain is characteristic for all protein kinases, with a remarkable degree of sequence identity between the more than 180 known mammalian kinases, and highly conserved from yeast to man. The 200–300 amino acid residues of the catalytic core region are predicted to fold into a common three-dimensional structure, as revealed by crystallization of several protein kinases (26Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 27Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J.

Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Some protein kinase motifs are extremely well conserved. One of these motifs is the glycine-rich loop with the consensus sequence GXGXXG located in the first of 12 subdomains of the protein kinase catalytic domain. The three glycine residues of the glycine-rich loop are conserved in over 95% of the known human kinases known so far and even in other nucleotide-binding proteins such as the small G proteins Ras, Rac, and Rho. They fold into a β-strand-turn-β-strand structure and form a flexible clamp that covers and anchors the nontransferrable phosphates of ATP (reviewed in Ref. 30Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). The glycine residues provide the flexibility necessary for anchoring the ATP molecule and excluding the water; for this reason they are essential both for effective catalytic activity and low ATPase activity because of phosphate transfer on water molecules. The third glycine also forms a hydrogen bond with the ATP β-phosphate oxygen. Point mutations in any of the conserved glycines generally lead to a loss of enzymatic activity and have been shown to be responsible for enzymatic defects leading to human diseases. Examples include a form of diabetes where the third glycine in the ATP-binding site of the insulin receptor is substituted by valine, leading to insulin resistance (31Odawara M. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto R. Shibasaki Y. Tobe K. Accili D. Bevins C. Mikami Y. Matsuura N. Akanuma Y. Science. 1989; 245: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and the Ras-V12 oncogene involved in tumor development, where the second glycine is replaced by valine (32Taparowsky E. Suard Y. Fasano O. Shimizu K. Goldfarb M. Wigler M. Nature. 1982; 300: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 33Tong L.A. de Vos A.M. Milburn M.V. Jancarik J. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Kim S.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is of special interest that in aPKCs the third glycine is substituted by alanine, suggesting a unique mechanism of ATP binding with respect to other PKCs and unrelated kinases. The most conserved and probably best characterized residue of protein kinases is the so-called “invariant lysine” in subdomain II of the catalytic domain, corresponding to Lys-274 in human PKCι. It is directly involved in the phosphotransfer reaction and interacts with the α- and β-phosphates of ATP, thereby anchoring and orienting the nucleotide. Additionally, for the catalytic subunit of PKA this residue has been shown to form a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of the nearly invariant Glu-91 in subdomain III (corresponding to Glu-293 in aPKCι). Replacement of the invariant lysine by any other amino acid, including arginine, generally leads to a catalytically inactive kinase, and site-directed mutagenesis of this residue has almost become a standard approach to generate kinase-dead mutants. This has been shown for PKCζ, θ, α, and ε (1Kampfer S. Hellbert K. Villunger A. Doppler W. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. Ueberall F.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and many other kinases. Interestingly, the invariant lysine is also conserved in the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase, where a conservative K799R mutation not only completely abolishes ATP binding and kinase activity but also blocks the interaction with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (40Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 41Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the ATP-binding site in the catalytic domain belongs to the most conserved sequences within the protein kinase family, the most specific inhibitors of PKC bind to this part of the molecule and act by blocking ATP binding to the enzyme. This is the case for the bisindolylmaleimide GF109203X and other homologues of the potent PKC inhibitor staurosporine. It is intriguing that even within the PKC family these inhibitors exhibit clear isoenzyme specificity, affecting atypical isoforms more than 100-fold less than classical or novel PKCs (7Ueberall F. Hellbert K. Kampfer S. Maly K. Villunger A. Spitaler M. Mwanjewe J. Baier-Bitterlich G. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This fact together with the remarkable difference within the glycine-rich loop compared with other kinases suggests that, surprisingly, atypical PKCs differ significantly in the structure of their catalytic domain from other PKC isoforms and protein kinases in general. Because such a difference on one hand could in part explain the in vivo isoenzyme specificity and, on the other hand, should be useful for the development of specific aPKC inhibitors, we decided to exactly characterize the enzymatic properties of atypical PKCι. To proof the assumption of a unique ATP-binding domain of αPKCs and to see whether this is functionally reflected in the mode of ATP binding, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the central ATP-binding residue, the invariant lysine (Lys-274), by the chemically similar arginine or by tryptophan and measured the enzymatic activity of the resulting mutant proteins. The PKCι-K274R mutant exhibited normal enzymatic activity, and kinetic properties are very similar to the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the substitution of Trp for the invariant Lys-274 (aPKCι-K274W) resulted in a catalytically inactive enzyme. The same behavior could be observed when the PKCι mutants were studied in intact cells. This is in sharp contrast to virtually all other protein kinases, where the invariant lysine seems to be essential for correct folding of the kinase domain and interaction with ATP. To our knowledge, similar results have only been published for the very distantly related CDK-activating kinase from budding yeast (42Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results confirm that aPKCι possesses a unique ATP-binding domain, and they show that this results in an unusual mechanism of ATP binding and probably catalysis. This knowledge should be useful for the development of specific inhibitors of atypical PKCs as central mediators of essential cellular signaling pathways. The plasmids PKCι-WT, PKCι-A120E, and PKCι-K274R were kindly provided by T. Biden (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia) (8Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J.

HC-11 cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mmHEPES and 446 mg/liter l-alanyl-l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma). For transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well. After 6 h, the medium was replaced by 1 ml of Optimem medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1.5 μg of transfection plasmid/well was mixed with 0.5 ml of Optimem and 4.5 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol, added to the cells and incubated overnight. After removal of the transfection mix, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 ml of fresh medium was added, and the cells were incubated for additional 24 h. Transiently transfected cells were scraped off in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. 100 μl of Ni2+-NTA agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated in lysis buffer was added, and the tubes were rotated for 1 h to allow binding of RGS-His6-tagged PKCs to Ni2+-agarose. The purified PKCs were then washed four times with lysis buffer supplemented with 50 mm imidazole and eluted with 500 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. 100 ng of purified PKC were added to 100 μl of assay buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 μm substrate peptide PKCα-19–31/Ser-25 (Alexis), 40 μm ATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and stopped on ice. 50 μl of the reaction mix were transferred to phosphocellulose disc sheets (Life Technologies, Inc.). The phosphocellulose sheets were washed three times with 1% phosphoric acid and twice with distilled water and then transferred to a scintillation vial with 4 ml of scintillation fluid. The bound radioactivity was then measured in a liquid scintillation counter. 20 ng of purified PKC was separated on a 10% polyacrylamid gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-PTM, Millipore) by electroblotting. The membrane was equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween-20 and 1% skim milk powder overnight. The first antibody was added in a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml for the anti-RGS-His6 antibody (Qiagen) and 0.25 μg/ml for the anti-PKCι antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), and the membranes were incubated for 1 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween-20, the blot was incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase, 0.5 μl/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection of the protein bands was performed using Supersignal Reagent (Pierce). The indicated amounts of protein were directly pipetted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-PTM, Millipore) using a slot-blot apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection of PKC was performed as described above for the Western blot analysis. HC-11 mouse mammary epithelial cells were seeded into 6-well plates. 24 h later they were transfected for 1 h with 1.5 μg of DNA and 6 μl/well of Transfast (Promega) in 1 ml of Optimem medium. 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved with RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma) for additional 24 h. Following this incubation, the cells were collected and lysed according to the manufacturer's prescription. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-LuciferaseTM Reporter Assay (Promega) in a MicroBeta Trilux 1450 counter (Perkin-Elmer). Thefos-SRE-luciferase activity values were standardized by the activity of a cotransfected pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase (Promega). To characterize specific properties of the catalytic domain of atypical PKCι, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the invariant lysine in the ATP-binding pocket by the chemically similar amino acid residue arginine or by the unrelated tryptophan residue (K274R and K274W mutants, respectively), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All constructs were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pEF-neo containing a COOH-terminal RGS-His6 tag to allow protein purification from whole cell lysates. The constructs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectin. 48 h later, cells were lysed, and RGS-His6 tagged aPKCι was purified from the lysates by addition of Ni+2 agarose. After elution with imidazole the protein concentration was measured, and the samples for the in vitro kinase assay were adjusted to equal amounts of protein. The activity of the purified enzymes was measured in vitro by phosphorylation of a standard PKC substrate peptide derived from the cPKCα pseudosubstrate sequence (PKCα-19–31/Ser-25). The in vitro activity of the aPKCι mutants was compared with active and kinase-dead mutants of cPKCα purified in the same way. Fig.1 A shows that in contrast to the Lys → Arg mutant of cPKCα, aPKCι-K274R exhibits in vitro enzymatic activity similar to the wild type enzyme. Additionally, like the wild type aPKCι enzyme, aPKCι-K274R shows a very high basal activity in the absence of cofactors that is comparable with the activity of constitutively active cPKCα-AE or the corresponding Ala → Glu mutant of aPKCι (aPKCι-A120E). The results also show that the high basal enzymatic activity of aPKCι cannot be further increased by this mutation of the pseudosubstrate domain. To control the expression of the different mutants, the purified proteins were separated on a polyacrylamid gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with a RGS-His6-specific antibody. Fig. 1 B shows that all proteins were expressed in the COS-7 cells, although the expression level of kinase-dead aPKCι-K274W is significantly lower than that of the other constructs. The difference in the expression level between wild type aPKCι and aPKCι-K274W was quantified by a slot-blot analysis using different amounts of purified protein. Fig.2 A shows that the expression level of wild type aPKCι is about 10-fold higher than that of the kinase-inactive aPKCι-K274W mutant. Because equal amounts of purified protein were used for both wild type aPKCι and aPKCι-K274W in the slot-blot analysis, these results also show that the Ni2+-agarose used for purification exhibits significant unspecific binding to His-rich proteins, although these proteins do not have significant kinase activity (Fig. 1 A, vector control). We wanted to confirm that the absence of kinase activity in the aPKCι-K274W samples was not caused by a lower PKC content in the final reaction mix because of the lower expression level. For this purpose, different amounts of purified aPKCι-WT and aPKCι-K274W were adjusted to equal protein concentrations with Ni+2-agarose-treated samples from vector-transfected control cells containing unspecifically bound proteins and measured forin vitro kinase activity. Fig. 2 B shows that aPKCι-K274W is unable to phosphorylate the peptide substrate even at high concentrations, whereas wild type aPKCι leads to a concentration-dependent increase in enzymatic activity. In contrast to other PKC isoforms, aPKCs exhibit high basal enzymatic activity in vitro without the addition of cofactors. Although other PKCs have been shown to require diacylglycerol and acidic phospholipids like phosphatidylserine for optimal activity and the maintenance of their active conformation, for atypical PKCs a basal activation by protein activators like λ-interacting protein (43Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or ζ-interacting protein (25Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6169-6191Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar) seems to be sufficient. The enzymatic activation of aPKCs is dependent on the autophosphorylation of a threonine residue in the C terminus that is conserved in all PKCs (44Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Introduction of a negative charge in this position (T555E) leads to an enzyme with elevated basal enzymatic activity (Fig.3). To verify whether aPKCι-K274W retains any residual activity possibly activable in vivo, the same point mutation was introduced into the aPKCι-K274W protein. Fig. 3 shows that this double mutant is still completely inactive when measured in vitro. Because the T555E is capable to effectively increase the enzymatic activity of the wild type enzyme, the lack of activation of aPKCι-K274W indicates that this mutant is missing any residual activity. Because a kinase-dead mutant of aPKCι is a valuable tool for studying signal transduction pathways in vivo, we next confirmed its enzymatic inactivity using a biological readout system. HC-11 mouse mammary epithelial cells were transiently transfected with afos-SRE-luciferase reporter plasmid and constitutively active Ras-L61 together with wild type aPKCι or the aPKCι-K274W mutant. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, the K274W mutant is completely unable to confer an increase in thefos induction by Ras-L61 that can be observed with the wild type construct. The data also show that aPKCι-K274R behaves like the wild type enzyme not only in vitro but also in vivo u"

Under conditions favoring the presence of monovanadate, and in the presence of Ca2+, ADP, and Mg2+, cleavage results in two fragments of 71- and 38-kDa electrophoretic mobility. On the other hand, under conditions permitting formation of decavanadate, and in the absence of Ca2+ and ADP, cleavage results in two fragments of 88- and 21-kDa electrophoretic mobility. The amino terminus resulting from cleavage is blocked and resistant to Edman degradation. However, the initial photo-oxidation product can be reduced with NaB3H4, resulting in incorporation of radioactive 3H label. Extensive digestion of the labeled protein with trypsin then yields labeled peptides that are specific for the each of the photo-oxidation conditions, and can be sequenced after purification. Collection of the Edman reaction fractional products reveals the radioactive label and demonstrates that Thr353 is the residue oxidized by monovanadate at the phosphorylation site (i.e. Asp351). Correct positioning of monovanadate at the phosphorylation site requires binding of Mg2+ and ADP to the Ca2+-dependent conformation of the enzyme. Subsequent hydrolytic cleavage is likely assisted by the neighboring Asp601, and yields the 71- and 38-kDa fragments. On the other hand, Ser186 (and possibly the following three residues: Val187, Ile188, and Lys189) is the residue that is photo-oxidized by decavanadate in the absence of ADP. Hydrolytic cleavage of the oxidized product at this site is likely assisted by neighboring acidic residues, and yields the 88- and 21-kDa fragments. The bound decavanadate, which we find to produce steric interference with TNP-AMP binding, must therefore extend to the A domain (i.e. small cytosolic loop) in order to oxidize Ser186.

Chem. 1973; 248: 8222-8226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several kinetic studies have suggested that, in the absence of ATP, orthovanadate can bind to the SR ATPase and form a transition state analog of the phosphorylated intermediate (3Dupont Y. Bennett N. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Nakamoto R.K. de Meis L. Bernhard S. J. Biol.

On the other hand, decavanadate has been very useful in stabilizing bidimensional crystals of the SR ATPase (6Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2599-2603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby rendering possible electron crystallographic studies (7Taylor K.A. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,8Toyoshima C. Sasabe H. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1993; 362: 469-471Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is not entirely clear whether vanadate monomers and oligomers, which are known to coexist in various experimental conditions (9Aureliano M. Madeira V.M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), occupy the phosphorylation and/or distinct sites in the SR ATPase (10Hua S. Fabris D. Inesi G. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2217-2225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We considered that this uncertainty may be clarified by studies of vanadate-dependent ATPase cleavage, which was reported to occur following UV irradiation at different sites depending on the presence or the absence of Ca2+ (11Vegh M. Molnar E. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bio-Membr. 1990; 1023: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Molnar E. Varga S. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the cleavage sites and the mechanism of cleavage could not be characterized in previous studies on the SR ATPase, due to amino terminus blockage in the cleaved fragments (11Vegh M. Molnar E. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bio-Membr. 1990; 1023: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Molnar E. Varga S. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Detailed clarification of the mechanism of vanadate-dependent cleavage was recently obtained by studies on photo-oxidation and cleavage of the vanadate-myosin complex (13Grammer J.C. Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Cremo C.R. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15582-15592Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol.

In analogy to the cation transport ATPases, the mechanism of myosin ATPase includes complexation of the ATP terminal phosphate, which is involved in energy transduction. Although the myosin-phosphate complex does not include a covalent bond, it is still possible to obtain its transition state analog by reaction of myosin with orthovanadate. UV irradiation of such a complex produces photo-oxidation of Ser180, followed by rearrangement and peptide cleavage. Photocleavage of the vanadate complex was also obtained with the F1 mitochondrial ATPase (16Ko Y.H. Bianchet M. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Ko Y.H. Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28853-28856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this case cleavage occurs at the level of an alanine residue (Ala158) of the catalytic subunit. Taking advantage of the experience gained with these systems, we then performed a series of experiments in which we clarified the mechanism of cleavage in the SR ATPase, determined unambiguously the residues undergoing photo-oxidation and cleavage, and identified two distinct binding sites for monovanadate and decavanadate. SR vesicles were obtained with the microsomal fraction of rabbit leg muscle homogenate, as described by Eletr and Inesi (18Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (19Lowry O.H. Roseborough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-electrophoresis was carried out according to Weber and Osborn (20Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein staining was obtained with Coomassie Blue. TNP-AMP was purchased from Molecular Probes. Orthovanadate solutions were prepared as described by Ko et al. (16Ko Y.H. Bianchet M. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Ko Y.H. Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

This solution was boiled until it became clear (2 min), and the pH readjusted to 10, repeating this procedure three times. The orthovanadate concentration was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 2925 m−1cm−1 at 265 nm wavelength. The stock solution used in these experiments was 20 mm, and was stored at −80 °C under aluminum foil cover. Decavanadate was obtained by acidifying a 20 mm Na3VO4 solution to pH 2.0, cooling in ice, and then adjusting the pH to 6.5. The presence of decavanadate was revealed by a strong yellow color (21Young H.S. Rigaud J.L. Lacapère J.J. Reddy L.G. Stokes D.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2545-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Vanadate-dependent photo-oxidation of ATPase was carried out at pH 8.6, in a reaction mixture containing 1 mg/ml microsomal protein, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, 100 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ADP, 1 mm vanadate, and either 0.1 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. Alternatively, the reaction mixture contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm vanadate, and either 1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm CaCl2. The vanadate concentrations are always given as “monovanadate,” although oligovanadate is present at neutral pH. Following a 30-min preincubation, the mixture was illuminated for 15 min with long wavelength UV light, and then the protein was subjected to enzymatic or electrophoretic analysis. For reduction with borohydride, the photo-oxidized samples were diluted 1:25 with 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 10% sucrose. The microsomes were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the sediment obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, and 100 μm NaB3H4(522 mCi/mmol). Following incubation with borohydride for 1 h, the samples were diluted 1:25 with 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 10% sucrose. The microsomes were then sedimented and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 0.25 m sucrose, and trypsin (trypsin:microsomal protein = 1:10). Following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, and the supernatant was digested with additional trypsin (trypsin:original microsomal protein = 1:50) for 4 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptide fragments were then placed in a Waters HPLC system equipped with two 510 pumps, automated gradient controller 680, and a 490E multi-wavelength detector. Separation was obtained with an acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by purification with an acetonitrile gradient containing 10 mm ammonium acetate. The elution fractions were characterized by light absorption at 215 nm for peptide content, and by liquid scintillation spectrometry for determination of radioactivity. The radioactive fraction was then subjected to two further runs of HPLC purification. Sequencing of the radioactive peptide fragments was performed at Johns Hopkins University by Jodie Franklin, and repeated for fractional collection of Edman degradation products at the Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory of Baylor University by Dr. Richard G. Cook. Consistent with previous reports (3Dupont Y. Bennett N. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Nakamoto R.K. de Meis L. Bernhard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6040-6043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6111-6119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that vanadate affects strongly the SR ATPase, producing complete inhibition at 0.1 mm concentration (data not shown). As reported by Vegh et al. (11Vegh M. Molnar E. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bio-Membr. 1990; 1023: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Molnar et al. (12Molnar E. Varga S. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), exposure of the ATPase-vanadate complex to UV light at neutral pH yields a pattern of peptide cleavage that is dependent on the presence or the absence of Ca2+: two fragments of 88- and 21-kDa electrophoretic mobility in the absence of Ca2+, and 71- and 38-kDa in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.1). On the other hand, we found that, at alkaline pH, only the Ca2+-dependent cleavage patter (i.e. 71- and 38-kDa fragments) is obtained, whereas no cleavage is observed in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1). The Ca2+-dependent cleavage proceeds more efficiently at pH 8.6 than at pH 7.4 (data not shown). Nevertheless, we noted that under all conditions cleavage occurs only during the initial several minutes and, even after prolonged incubation, involves a maximum of approximately 50% of the ATPase molecules. This limit is likely due to protein unfolding upon prolonged illumination, suggesting again that cleavage occurs only when the ATPase is able to acquire native conformations, in the presence or in the absence of Ca2+. The pH dependence of the cleavage pattern prompted us to perform spectroscopic measurements in order to clarify whether mono- or oligovanadate would be present in the reaction mixture at different pH. Fig. 2 A shows the light absorption spectrum of a monovanadate solution (made initially at alkaline pH 10) and then transferred to the pH 8.6 reaction mixture. The spectrum exhibits a monophasic character that is attributed to monovanadate. However, when the same solution of monovanadate is transferred to the pH 7.4 reaction mixture, the absorption spectrum changes rapidly to reflect the presence of oligovanadate species, in addition to monovanadate. On the other hand, when a decavanadate solution (made originally at pH 2.0) is transferred to the pH 7.4 reaction mixture, the absorption spectrum shows a mixture of oligo- and monovanadate (Fig. 2 B). Complete transformation to monovanadate is obtained if the decavanadate solution is transferred to the pH 8.6 reaction mixture (Fig. 2 B). It is then apparent that the specific cleavage pattern obtained at pH 8.6 can only be related to monovanadate binding, since monovanadate is the only species present at alkaline pH. Since this cleavage requires Ca2+, the Ca2+-dependent pattern obtained at pH 7.4 must be also due to monovanadate. On the other hand, the cleavage pattern obtained in the absence of Ca2+ appears related to oligovanadate binding, since it is not observed when monovanadate is the only species present in the reaction mixture (pH 8.6). Among the vanadate oligomers, decavanadate has been shown the species that binds to the SR ATPase, favoring formation of tubular crystals (6Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2599-2603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Taylor K.A. Dux L. Martonosi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Toyoshima C. Sasabe H. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1993; 362: 469-471Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assume that decavanadate is the active oligomeric species. Additional and specific features of the cleavage patterns obtained in the presence or in the absence of Ca2+ are related to their ADP and vanadate concentration dependence. It is shown in Fig.3 that the Ca2+-dependent cleavage (71–38-kDa fragments) is favored by ADP in the presence of Mg2+, whereas the cleavage obtained in the absence of Ca2+ (88–21-kDa fragments) is not. Furthermore, the 88–21-kDa cleavage requires at least 0.5 mm vanadate, whereas the 71–38-kDa cleavage occurs at a lower vanadate concentration (Fig.4).Figure 4Vanadate concentration requirement for cleavage of ATPase in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8408-8415Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), vanadate-dependent photo-cleavage of the SR ATPase may be a stepwise process beginning with oxidation of a serine or threonine residue, followed by rearrangement and hydrolytic cleavage. We then proceeded to react the oxidized residues with [3H]borohydride, thereby obtaining radioactive labeled intermediates. In order to identify the 71-38-kDa cleavage site, we then placed a3H radioactive label on the ATPase irradiated at pH 8.6 in the presence of vanadate, Ca2+, Mg2+, and ADP. The labeled ATPase was then digested extensively with trypsin. The soluble peptide fragments were collected and separated by HPLC, and a single radioactive fragment was isolated. When the isolated peptide was subjected to sequencing analysis, seven productive cycles of Edman degradation were obtained, yielding Thr, Gly, Thr, Leu, Thr, Thr, and Asn. This sequence demonstrates that the isolated fragment corresponds to the ATPase segment beginning with Thr353, and cleaved by trypsin at Lys352 at one end, and either at Lys365 or at Lys371 at the other end. Most importantly, the radioactive label appeared only with the first degradation cycle, indicating that only Thr353 was radioactive. Therefore, Thr353 is the residue undergoing monovanadate-dependent photo-oxidation and cleavage. Thr353 is not within the Lys515–Asp659 predicted in previous studies (11Vegh M. Molnar E. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bio-Membr. 1990; 1023: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Molnar E. Varga S. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Thr353, however, is consistent with the sizes (71 and 38 kDa) of the two fragments resulting from cleavage, with reference to 109 kDa for the entire ATPase. It should be pointed out that Thr353 is quite close to Asp351, the residue phosphorylated by ATP. This location, as well as the requirement for ADP and Mg2+, indicates that the 71–38-kDa photocleavage occurs as a consequence of monovanadate binding at the phosphorylation site. In order to identify the 88–21-kDa cleavage site, we placed3H radioactive label on the ATPase irradiated at pH 7.4 in the presence of vanadate (including decavanadate) and EGTA (Fig.5). The labeled ATPase was then digested extensively with trypsin. Following HPLC separation, we obtained a single radioactive fragment that yielded 13 productive cycles of Edman degradation, including Val, Asp, Gln, Ser, Ile, Leu, Thr, Gly, Glu, Ser, Val, Ser, and Val. This fragment corresponds to the ATPase segment beginning to Val175 (cleaved at Arg174 and Lys189). The fractional samples obtained by Edman degradation showed no radioactivity associated with the initial 11 cycles. The radioactive label appeared following the 12th cycle (Ser186) and trailed somewhat with the following three cycles. It should be pointed out that the efficiency of degradation is significantly reduced after 12 cycles, and the radioactivity associated with the following peaks may be due to Ser186 carryover. It is also possible that more than one residue is oxidized by the decavanadate oxygen atoms. At any rate, Ser186 is the main residue undergoing photo-oxidation by decavanadate in the absence of Ca2+ and ADP. Cleavage of its oxidized product is consistent with the size (88 and 21 kDa) of the cleaved fragments and is reasonably near the site (T2: Arg198) predicted by previous studies (11Vegh M. Molnar E. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bio-Membr. 1990; 1023: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Molnar E. Varga S. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The experiments described above are consistent with the presence of monovanadate at the phosphorylation site (i.e. Asp351), whereby monovanadatedependent photo-oxidation and cleavage involves the neighboring Thr353. On the other hand, those experiments do not, by themselves, clarify unambiguously whether decavanadate binds at the same site as monovanadate, or to a distinct and more probable site within the nucleotide binding domain (21Young H.S. Rigaud J.L. Lacapère J.J. Reddy L.G. Stokes D.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2545-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To clarify this question, we probed that domain with the analog TNP-AMP that is negligibly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but develops a fluorescent signal upon binding to the SR ATPase (23Watanabe T. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11510-11516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then found that addition of decavanadate (at neutral pH) produces a drastic reduction of the TNP-AMP fluorescence (Fig. 5 A), evidently due to displacement of bound TNP-AMP by decavanadate. On the contrary, monovanadate (at alkaline pH) actually enhances the fluorescence of bound TNP-AMP (Fig. 5 B), due to a long range effect of occupancy of the phosphorylation on TNP-AMP bound at the nucleotide site (24Nakamoto R.K. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steric interference between TNP-AMP and decavanadate binding is consistent with recent structural studies (22Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate unambiguously that under conditions permitting the 71–38-kDa or the 88–21-kDa cleavage, photo-oxidation is catalyzed by vanadate bound as monovanadate to the phosphorylation site, or as decavanadate bound to the nucleotide (TNP-AMP) site, respectively. Several enzymes undergo UV-induced oxidation or cleavage when vanadate is bound in place of phosphate at the catalytic site (reviewed in Ref. 25Muhlrad A. Ringel I. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1995; 31: 211-230PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to the mechanism of cleavage, it was reported that irradiation of the Mg ADP-orthovanadate complex with myosin ATPase produces oxidation of a serine side chain to yield an aldehyde. Medium oxygen is then incorporated through a free radical formed on the serine α-carbon, followed by Criegee type rearrangement and final hydrolytic cleavage with assistance of a neighboring acidic residue (13Grammer J.C. Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Cremo C.R. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15582-15592Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the mitochondrial F1 ATP synthase is cleaved by UV irradiation in the presence of vanadate with no need for ADP. In this case, cleavage involves an alanine residue (16Ko Y.H. Bianchet M. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Ko Y.H. Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28853-28856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cleavage of SR ATPase by UV irradiation in the presence of vanadate was previously reported by Vegh et al. (11Vegh M. Molnar E. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bio-Membr. 1990; 1023: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and Molnar et al. (12Molnar E. Varga S. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), who, at neutral pH, observed different cleavage sites in the absence as opposed to the presence of Ca2+. We find that experimentation at neutral pH produces rapid equilibration of mono- and oligovanadate species, and demonstration of a selective monovanadate effect requires alkaline pH. When irradiation is performed at alkaline pH (i.e. under conditions favoring the vanadate monomer), only the Ca2+-dependent cleavage is observed. On the other hand, at neutral pH (i.e. permitting coexistence of mono- and decavanadate), the two cleavage patterns requiring the presence or the removal of Ca2+ are produced by monovanadate or decavanadate, respectively. Due to amino terminus blockage of the fragments resulting from cleavage, previous studies (11Vegh M. Molnar E. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bio-Membr. 1990; 1023: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Molnar E. Varga S. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were unable to identify the cleavage sites by amino acid sequencing. Nevertheless, it was suggested that cleavage in the presence of Ca2+ occurs “between Lys515 and Asp659”, whereas cleavage in the absence of Ca2+ occurs “near the T2 cleavage site” (Arg198). Our experiments reveal a sequential mechanism of oxidation and cleavage that matches closely that of myosin, confirming that the amino terminus of the cleavage product is blocked and resistant to Edman degradation. The initial oxidation product is demonstrated by its reduction with borohydride and incorporation of radioactive 3H. We were then able to identify the labeled amino acid by subjecting the protein to extensive digestion, isolating the radioactive fragment, sequencing, and demonstrating the radioactive label in the fractional product of Edman degradation. We found that the Ca2+-dependent cleavage is preceded by photo-oxidation of Thr353. This is quite removed from the region (between Lys515 and Asp659) suggested previously (11Vegh M. Molnar E. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bio-Membr. 1990; 1023: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Molnar E. Varga S. Martonosi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1068: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but is consistent with the sizes (71 and 38 kDa) of the two fragments resulting from the related cleavage (Fig. 1). Thr353 is quite close to Asp351, the residue undergoing phosphorylation as an intermediate step of the ATPase catalytic cycle. Photo-oxidation and cleavage by monovanadate at the phosphorylation site requires binding of ADP and Mg2+ to the Ca2+-dependent conformation of the enzyme. Hydrolytic cleavage of the photo-oxidation product is assisted by an acidic residue, likely to be Asp601, whose side chain resides within 6 Å from Thr353 within the Ca2+-dependent conformation of the cytosolic P domain (Ref. 22Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar; see diagram in Fig. 6). It is intriguing that a conformation-dependent displacement of the corresponding aspartate residue has been proposed for the Na+,K+-ATPase, to approach the vanadate-magnesium complex at the catalytic site (26Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16213-16221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cleavage occurring in the absence of Ca2+ and yielding the 88- and 21-kDa fragments, is evidently related to decavanadate binding, since it does not occur when decavanadate is absent (alkaline pH). It occurs only in the presence of decavanadate and in the absence of Ca2+ binding. The decavanadate-dependent cleavage does not require ADP. Consistent with structural studies (22Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar) indicating that decavanadate resides in a positively charged groove formed by the N (nucleotide binding) and P (phosphorylation) domains, we find that decavanadate displaces TNP-AMP from the nucleotide site (Fig. 5). On the other hand, Ser186 resides within the small cytosolic domain (A domain) including the extreme amino-terminal sequence between Met1and Glu58, and the following loop between Trp107 and Ser261. Photo-oxidation of Ser186 by decavanadate then raises the question of its proximity to the decavanadate site (P and N domains). In fact, the A, P, and N domains are quite separated in the Ca2+-dependent structure of the ATPase, but are approximated by the conformational change produced by removal of Ca2+ (22Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with our observation that oxidation by decavanadate occurs only in the absence of Ca2+. As depicted in Fig. 6 in the model for the enzyme without Ca2+ but with decavanadate, there is a strong density peak lined by positively charged residues in the groove formed by three cytoplasmic domains (A, N, and P). This peak has been assigned to decavanadate and some of the lining residues are likely to be responsible also for TNP-AMP binding (27McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5301-5309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their involvement will explain the decrease of TNP-AMP fluorescence. The locations of decavanadate and Ser186 in the model agree very well with the present results. The neighboring Asp176 and Glu183 are likely to assist hydrolytic cleavage of the initial photo-oxidation product. In conclusion, we have clarified the mechanism of vanadate-dependent cleavage of SR ATPase, demonstrating that it includes sequential photo-oxidation and cleavage of the oxidation product. A cleavage pattern that requires Ca2+, ADP, and Mg2+ is produced by monovanadate binding at the phosphorylation site, and involves Thr353. An alternative cleavage pattern that requires removal of Ca2+ is produced by decavanadate binding at or near the nucleotide site, and involves Ser186. The structural requirements for the specific cleavage patterns produced by monovanadate and decavanadate are consistent with current models of the ATPase conformation in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+ (22Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Manuscript and figures were edited by Jerry Domanico."

Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8574-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the importance of p107 and p130 phosphorylation has not been established. Because the Cdk4/6-dependent phosphorylation of p107 and p130 coincides with the release of p107 and p130 from E2Fs and with the induction of p107/p130-responsive genes in late G1, it has seemed likely that p107 and p130 phosphorylation by Cdk4/6 is required for release from E2F, for induction of p107/p130-responsive genes, and for normal G1-S progression. However, the requirement for such phosphorylation is brought into question in cells that lack functional pRB, because pRB(−) tumor cells generally express high levels of the Cdk4/6 inhibitor p16INK4A (hereafter referred to as p16) (73Serrano M.

Accordingly, the growth inhibitory functions of p107 and p130 appear to be circumvented in pRB(−) cells without p107 and p130 being phosphorylated by the Cdk4/6 kinases. Moreover, the mechanism that is used to circumvent p107- and p130-mediated growth inhibition would appear to be highly effective, because pRB(−), p16(+) tumors only very rarely have inactivating mutation of the p130 gene (see Ref. 85Helin K. Holm K. Niebuhr A. Eiberg H. Tommerup N. Hougaard S. Poulsen H.S. Spang-Thomsen M. Norgaard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6933-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar for the only example to date), and none have been reported to have mutation of p107. At present, mechanisms by which the growth inhibitory effects of p107 and p130 are overcome in pRB(−), p16(+) cells are unknown. As one possibility, p107 and p130 may remain constitutively underphosphorylated, bound to E2Fs, and able to repress p107/p130-responsive genes, with this having little effect on cell proliferation due to the more profound consequences of the loss of pRB. Arguing against this idea, however, is the notion that p107/p130-responsive genes may be important for progression through various stages of the cell cycle and are indeed expressed in pRB(−) cells. 2D. Cobrinik, unpublished observations.. 2D. Cobrinik, unpublished observations.. One means by which transcriptional repression by p107 and p130 might be bypassed is through the exclusion of p107-E2F-4 and p130-E2F-4 complexes from the nucleus in late G1 and S phase cells (86Magae J. Wu C.L. Illenye S. Harlow E. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 87Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), although it is currently unclear whether this can occur in the absence of p107 and p130 phosphorylation. An alternative means by which the growth inhibitory effects of p107 and p130 might be bypassed in pRB(−), p16(+) cells, and which is addressed in the current study is through the release of p107 and p130 from E2Fs, due to their phosphorylation by kinases other than Cdk4 or Cdk6. Here, we show that p130 but not p107 is indeed phosphorylated and released from E2F-4 in a Cdk4/6-independent but Cdk2-dependent process. These findings provide a mechanism by which p130 is inactivated in pRB(−), p16(+) cells and highlight the involvement of distinct Cdks in the regulation of different pRB family proteins.

A, Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with the Hook gene and expression vectors for p16 (lanes 1 and 6), DNCdk2 (lanes 2 and 7), or DNCdk3 (lanes 3 and 4), or with empty expression vector (lanes 5 and 8) and were serum starved, restimulated for 21 h, and selected using magnetic beads. Protein lysates prepared from the selected (lanes 1–5) or unselected (lanes 6–8) cells were then subjected to Western blotting with anti-p130 antibody. The position of the p130 Form IIb is indicated. The impaired production of Form IIb in DNCdk2-expressing cells (lane 2) is most readily appreciated by comparing p130 mobility to that of a consistently migrating species that cross reacts with the p130 antibody (asterisk).B, the high level expression of p16 (lane 1), DNCdk2 (lane 2), and DNCdk3 (lane 4) relative to their endogenous counterparts in transfected and selected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a mixture of the corresponding antibodies. C, the ability of DNCdk2 and DNCdk3 to induce a G1 block was confirmed by co-transfecting Saos-2 cells with an expression vector for CD20 together with vectors encoding either DNCdk2, DNCdk3, DNCdk4, or p16, as indicated, or with the “empty” cDNA3 vector control. At 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD20 antibody and with propidium iodide, and DNA content of CD20(+) cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis.

Using the baculovirus system, this cysteine-less α1-subunit and wild-type β1-subunit were expressed in High Five cells. After 3 days of infection, cells were fractionated, and endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membranes were isolated. The molecular activity of the cysteine-less mutant in the plasma membranes was close to the wild-type protein (8223 min−1 versus 6655 min−1). Cation and ATP activation of Na,K-ATPase activities revealed that replacing all 23 cysteines resulted in only a 50% reduction of Km for Na+, a 2-fold increase in Km for K+, and no changes in Km for ATP. The distribution of α-subunits among the membranes showed a high percentage of cysteine-less protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus compared with the wild-type protein. Furthermore, the cellular stability of the αβ assembly appeared reduced in the cysteine-less mutant. Cells harvested after more than 3 days of infection showed extensive degradation of the cysteine-less α-subunit, which is not observed with the wild-type enzyme. Thus the Na,K-ATPase contains no cysteine residues that are critical for function, but the folding and/or assembly pathway of this enzyme is affected by total cysteine substitution.

The most commonly accepted model for the reaction mechanism of the Na,K-ATPase involves the sequential formation of two acyl-phosphate intermediates. The first intermediate, E1P, forms on the transfer of the terminal phosphate of ATP to Asp369 in a sodium-dependent fashion. This form of phosphoenzyme intermediate is ADP-sensitive and K+-insensitive. When the sodium ions leave the protein,E1P is converted to E2P, which is a potassium-sensitive and ADP-insensitive intermediate. This is the basis of the Albers-Post model (6Post R.L. Toda G. Rogers F.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 691-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the reaction mechanism of the Na,K-ATPase, as well as for most P2-type ATPases (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Early important observations using N-ethylmaleimide delineated these phosphoenzyme forms and showed that a population of sulfhydryl residues, when modified, blocked the E1P to E2P transition and inhibited ATPase activity (7Fahn S. Hurley M.R. Koval G.J. Albers R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1890-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations were among the first to demonstrate that cysteine residues may play a key role in the Na,K-ATPase enzymatic cycle. Later works have identified cysteine residues that may be involved in ouabain binding (8Schultheis P.J.

In addition, several sulfhydryl-reactive reagents have been shown to inactivate the Na,K-ATPase (13Patzelt-Wenczler R. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Kaplan J.H. Mone M.D. Arch.

Commun. 1990; 167: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the modified cysteine residues were not identified, and the functional significance of these residues are unknown. We have shown recently that a Cys-specific maleimide, MIANS,1 inactivates the Na,K-ATPase activity by selectively modifying Cys577 and that inactivation is prevented by preincubation with ATP (11Gatto C. Thornewell S.J. Holden J.P. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24995-25003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although data from our labeling studies demonstrated that Cys577 is located in the ATP-binding domain of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit, it is not clear whether the sulfhydryl side chain of this residue is directly involved in ATP binding. In a very recent work, Shi et al. (17Shi H.G. Mikhaylova L. Zichittella A.E. Arguello J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) constructed a panel of ouabain-resistant sheep α1-subunit mutants, in each of which one or several of the 23 native cysteine residues were substituted. The α-subunits that contained the single mutations were expressed in HeLa cells, and all but two mutants containing the C242A or C242S substitution were able to support cell growth under ouabain-selective pressure. They concluded in that study that the expression of a functional cysteine-less α-subunit would not be possible because Cys242 may play an important role in enzyme function. However, they did not rule out the possibility that Cys242is not essential for function but rather plays a role in protein folding or trafficking and that the expression system used in their study does not result in plasma membrane localization of this particular mutant protein. Of course, the ability to individually substitute single cysteines and produce functional Na,K-ATPase mutants, each with small changes in enzymatic properties, does not mean that a Na,K-ATPase mutant with all 23 cysteines simultaneously substituted would retain activity. In the present work we have constructed a form of the sheep renal Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit in which all 23 of its native cysteine residues (Fig. 1) are removed. This cysteine-less α-subunit and the wild-type β1-subunit were heterologously expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. This expression system, first employed in studies of Na,K-ATPase by Mercer and co-workers (18DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recently by us to define the membrane topology of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit (19Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), provides the opportunity to study expressed Na,K-ATPases in an environment containing little or no endogenous Na,K-ATPase activity (18DeTomaso A.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have examined the properties of this novel Na,K-ATPase mutant lacking all the α-subunit cysteines and find that the Na+, K+, and ATP concentration dependence and turnover number of the phosphoenzyme are only slightly different from the native enzyme. The availability of a cysteine-less α-subunit provides the groundwork for future structure-function studies that utilize introduced cysteines and sulfhydryl chemistry. A sheep α1-subunit cDNA was cloned into the pOCUS-2 vector (Novagen) as a NotI and Sse8387I fragment. The 23 native cysteine residues in the α-subunit (Fig. 1) were then substituted with alanines or serines via polymerase chain reaction overlap extension mutagenesis (20Higuchi R. Krummel B.

Recombinant baculovirus containing the sheep β1-subunit and the wild-type or cysteine-less α1-subunit cDNA was produced by following the protocols described previously (19Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The genomic DNA of the recombinant baculoviruses was isolated by using the Easy-DNA Kit (Invitrogen) and was sequenced to ensure the appropriate cysteine mutations in the α-subunit.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for site-directed mutagenesisMutationsPCR primers (5′–3′)C86S GGGTCAAGTTCTcgCGACAGCTGTTTGGGC104S GGATTGGAGCAGTTCTaaGCTTCCTGGCCTATGGCC138SGCCGTCGTCATCATAACCGGaaGcTTCTCCTACTATCAAGC204S GCGAATGGCTcCAAGGTcGAcAACTCCTCACTCACGC242S CAACCAACTcTGTTGAAGGCACTGCC336A TGGCCACCGTCACGGTGgcgCTGACCCTGACTGCCC349S GGAAGAACTcCTTAGTGAAGAACCTGGC367S CCACGTCCACgATaTcCTCAGACAAAACTGGC421S GTCCAGAATTGCAGGcCTTTcTAACAGaGCCGTGTTTCC452S GTCTGCGCTTCTGAAaTcgATaGAGGTGTGCTGCC456S,C457S GAAaTcgATaGAGGTGaGCTcCGGTTCTGTGAAGGC511S GATCCTGGATCGCTcgACtTCCATCCC549S CGTGTGCTGGGTTTCaGCCACTTGATGCTGC577S CTGTTGATAATCTaaGCTTCGTGGGGCTCATCC599S GATGCTGTGGGCAAATcgCGAAGTGCTGGAATCC656S CAGGGATGCCAGGGCtaGCGTGGTGCATGGAAGC698S CATCATTGTGGAAGGaTcCCAGAGACAGGGTGC802A GACCGTCACCATCCTCgcgATAGACTTGGGAACC911S TCGTGGAATTCACCTctCAtACGGCCTTCTTTC930A GTGGGCTGACTTGGTCATCgcgAAGACgcGtAGGC964A CTTTCCTTTCCTACgcgCCTGGtATGGGTGTTGCC983S TACCTGGTGGTTCTcTGCaTTCCCCTACTCGPolymerase chain reaction overlap extension mutagenesis was carried out with primers listed to replace the native cysteine residues with alanine or serine residues in the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit.

Log-phase high viability High Five cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses for 3 or 5 days and were harvested for protein purification (19Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The harvested High Five cell membranes were fractionated on a five-step sucrose gradient, and the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane fractions were collected as described (19Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase assays of High Five membrane proteins were carried out as described (19Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For MIANS inactivation, cell membranes were incubated with 60 μm MIANS (Molecular Probes) at room temperature (∼22 °C) for 15 min and then with 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 1 min prior to the ATPase assay. For determining K+ activation, the KCl concentration was varied from 0 to 30 mm. For Na+ activation, the NaCl concentration was varied from 0 to 125 mm, and 10 mm potassium azide (American Azide Corp., Cedar City, UT) instead of the sodium azide was used. For ATP activation, the ATP concentration was varied from 0 to 1.2 mm. Curve fitting of the ligand-activation data was performed using the computer software Sigma Plot as described previously (22Blanco G. Sanchez G. Mercer R.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9897-9903Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation with [32P]ATP was carried out in a 50-μl medium containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 50 μg of membrane protein. The mixture was placed on ice for 1 h, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP ([γ-32P]ATP, NEN Life Science Products, and 7.27 μm Tris-ATP) on ice for 60 s. The phosphorylation was quenched with 750 μl of ice-cold 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 0.5 mm Tris-ATP and 1.5 mm Tris-phosphate, and the samples were filtered through Millipore filters (pore size 0.45 μm), washed three times with 2 ml of quenching buffer, and counted in a scintillation counter. Phosphorylation of the Na,K-ATPase enzyme was calculated from the difference between [32P]phosphate incorporation in the medium above and that measured in a medium containing 100 mm KCl instead of NaCl. Equilibrium [3H]ouabain binding was carried out as described previously (19Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated in 7.5% acrylamide gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics, Inc.) by electroblotting in 10 mm of CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. The nitrocellulose blots were stained with a mouse monoclonal anti-α1 or anti-β antibody (Affinity BioReagent, Inc.) and peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The wild-type and cysteine-less versions of the sheep Na,K-ATPase α1-subunits were co-expressed with the wild-type β1-subunit in baculovirus-infected High Five cells (19Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) for 3 or 5 days, and the ER, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane fractions of the infected cells were isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation. The plasma membrane fractions of the 3-day infected High Five cells contained the highest Na,K-ATPase activities (reported in TableII) and were used to measure the ligand-binding activities as well as the cation and ATP activation of the enzymes.Table IICharacteristics of Na,K-ATPases isolated from plasma membrane preparations of baculovirus-infected High Five cellsNa,K-ATPase activityATP phosphorylationMolecular activityμmol P 1 · mg −1 protein · h −1pmol · mg −1 proteinmin −1Wild type11.02 ± 0.3527.6 ± 2.166655 ± 562Cys-less3.34 ± 0.536.77 ± 0.508223 ± 1439Na,K-ATPase and ATP phosphorylation assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The molecular activity, which is the turnover rate of phosphoenzyme per min, was calculated by taking the ratio of specific activity over phosphorylation number.

Each value below represents the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations from at least three different membrane preparations. The ATP phosphorylation levels of the wild-type and cysteine-less versions of the Na,K-ATPases were measured, and the molecular activities for the two enzymes were calculated. As can be seen in TableII, although the specific activity of the cysteine-less mutant is less than the wild-type protein, both forms have equivalent molecular activity. In other words, despite the lower copy number of the cysteine-less mutant in the plasma membrane, each α(cysteine-less)β complex is as active as the wild-type protein. The [3H]ouabain-binding activities of the expressed proteins were also determined, which were 18.50 ± 1.00 pmol·mg−1 protein for the wild-type enzyme and 4.36 ± 0.35 pmol·mg−1 protein for the cysteine-less mutant enzyme. This is a further indication of the lower expression level of the cysteine-less protein, and these estimates agree well with those of the phosphorylation levels. The ouabain-sensitive Na,K-ATPase activities of the expressed proteins were measured in media containing various concentrations of Na+ and K+, and the corresponding curves for representative experiments are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The kinetic parameters of the cation activation are described in Table III, which shows that the cysteine-less mutant displayed a higher apparent affinity for Na+ ions and a lower apparent affinity for K+ions when compared with the expressed wild-type enzyme. However, these differences were only about 2-fold in each case and occurred without any changes in the Hill coefficient for ion activation. Similarly, we compared the ATP concentration dependence of the Na,K-ATPase activities of the expressed wild-type and cysteine-less enzymes. Typical results are summarized in Table III. The half-maximal concentrations for ATP were 0.23 mm and 0.17 mm for the wild-type and cysteine-less Na,K-ATPases, respectively.Figure 3K+ activation of Na,K-ATPases expressed in High Five insect cells.

Each value below represents the means ± S.D. of duplicate determinations from two to four different membrane preparations. Open table in a new tab Na,K-ATPase assays were performed in the presence of various Na+, K+ or ATP concentrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The apparent affinities (Km) and Hill coefficients (nH) were calculated according to the methods of Blanco et al.(22Blanco G.

Each value below represents the means ± S.D. of duplicate determinations from two to four different membrane preparations. The wild-type and cysteine-less versions of the Na,K-ATPases were incubated with MIANS, a cysteine-modifying reagent previously shown to inactivate the wild-type enzyme isolated from renal tissue (11Gatto C. Thornewell S.J. Holden J.P. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24995-25003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Typical results are represented in Fig. 4, which shows that, although MIANS inactivated the ATPase activity of the wild-type enzyme, the ATPase activity of the cysteine-less enzyme was not affected. After 3 days of infection, the ER and Golgi apparatus membrane fractions contained most of the expressed cysteine-less α-subunits (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 4and 5 with lane 6), whereas with the expressed wild-type protein a greater proportion is found in the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1-3). The ATPase activity for the wild-type α-subunits remained constant from 3 to 5 days postinfection (10.7 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1 in the plasma membrane), and Western analyses showed that these proteins are not degraded (Fig.5 B, lanes 1–3). The cysteine-less α-subunit, on the other hand, showed lower ATPase activity 5 days postinfection (2.18 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1 in the plasma membrane compared with 3.34 μmol of Pi·mg−1protein·h−1 for 3 days postinfection), and Western blots of the membrane fractions showed that the cysteine-less proteins are highly degraded (Fig.5 B, lanes 4–6). Comparable amounts of the β-subunits were detected by Western analysis in all membrane fractions and did not appear to be degraded (data not shown). In the present work we have constructed a version of the sheep renal Na,K-ATPase in which all 23 of the native cysteine residues in the α1-subunit have been replaced by alanines or serines. This cysteine-less α-subunit and the sheep β1-subunit were heterologously expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells, and the resulting cell plasma membrane fractions were isolated for functional characterization. We obtained evidence demonstrating that the removal of all 23 cysteines from the native α-subunit does not compromise enzymatic activity. Our data show that the expression level of the wild-type Na,K-ATPase is higher than that of the cysteine-less protein (Fig. 5), and this difference is reflected in their ouabain-sensitive ATPase activities (Table II). However, the molecular activities (represented by the phosphoenzyme turnover numbers) of these two Na,K-ATPases, which are independent of the expression levels, are essentially the same within the experimental errors (Table II). The expressed Na,K-ATPases were further characterized by activation with cations and ATP, and the results are summarized in Table III. The cysteine-less version of the Na,K-ATPase, when compared with the expressed wild-type protein, displays a higher apparent affinity for Na+ ions and a lower apparent affinity for K+ ions. This may come about from a small change in a rate constant that results in a shift in E1/E2 equilibria where E1 forms are favored over E2 forms in the cysteine-less mutant compared with the wild type. In any case, the cation affinities for the two proteins do not differ greatly (Na+ ions: 16.38 mm for wild type, 8.57 mm for cysteine-less; K+ ions: 3.40 mm for wild type, 7.24 mm for cysteine-less) and agree well with the kinetic parameters of the rat α1β1 Na,K-ATPase also expressed in insect cells (16.4 mm for Na+, 1.9 mm for K+) (see Ref. 22Blanco G. Sanchez G. Mercer R.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9897-9903Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Km values for ATP in the overall Na,K-ATPase activity are only slightly altered (from 0.23 to 0.17 mm) when all 23 cysteine residues of the wild-type enzyme are replaced (Table III). Together, these results suggest that the sulfhydryl-bearing residues of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit do not play an important role in ligand binding or ATP hydrolysis. Our Western analyses show that most of the cysteine-less α-subunits are localized in the ER and Golgi apparatus membrane fractions (Fig.5 A, lanes 4–6) unlike the wild-type enzyme, which is predominantly located in the plasma membrane (Fig.5 A, lane 3). Because the cysteine-less mutant has the highest specific activity in the plasma membrane, this suggests that a large portion of the α-subunits may be incorrectly folded or assembled in the ER and Golgi fractions. This lack of correct folding or assembly also apparently influences stability or protease susceptibility, because protein degradation is clearly seen in the cysteine-less α-subunits (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4–6) but not in the expressed wild-type proteins (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1–3). These observations suggest to us that although the lack of cysteine residues in the α-subunit has no major effect on function, one or several of the 23 native cysteines may affect the rates of protein folding and/or assembly. The greater protease susceptibility of incorrectly folded or immature α-subunit has been reported previously (24Geering K. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Beggah A. Mathews P. Beguin P. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20895-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results obtained in the present study allow several important conclusions to be made regarding the functions of the 23 native cysteines in the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. First, it is clear that none of the cysteines is essential for the structural or functional integrity of the Na,K-ATPase. Our total cysteine-less α-subunit was expressed and targeted to the plasma membranes of baculovirus-infected insect cells (Fig.5 A, lane 6) and showed molecular activity that is similar to the wild type (Table II). Second, it seems likely that all previous studies have shown that inactivation or modification of the properties of the Na,K-ATPase following selective modification of sulfhydryls is due to the introduction of bulky moieties into the cysteine side-chains and not due to the modification of an essential or important cysteine side chain per se. We have previously shown using chemical modification that Cys577 is located in the ATP-binding domain (11Gatto C. Thornewell S.J. Holden J.P. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24995-25003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), i.e. modification of this cysteine inhibits activity and inhibition is prevented by ATP. Data presented here establish that the sulfhydryl side chain of Cys577 is not directly involved in substrate binding. Several other Cys-directed reagents have also been used to inhibit and study the structure-function relationships of the Na,K-ATPase (13Patzelt-Wenczler R. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Kaplan J.H. Mone M.D. Arch.

Commun. 1990; 167: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the locations of these modified cysteines have not been identified, our data show that none of these residues would be critical for function. Similar observations have been made previously with the Neurospora crassa H+-ATPase, another P2-ATPase. Enzyme inactivation with N-ethylmaleimide led to the suggestions of important cysteine residues in the ATP-binding or catalytic domain of this protein. However, site-directed mutagenesis and analyses of the expressed mutants revealed that cysteines play no essential role in the enzymatic mechanism of the H+-ATPase (26Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28535-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Mahanty S.K. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 367-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The third conclusion that can be drawn from our experiments is that Cys242 plays no functional role in the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. As described earlier (see Introduction), Shi and co-workers have constructed a panel of ouabain-resistant sheep α1-subunit mutants in which one to three of the 23 native cysteine residues were substituted (17Shi H.G. Mikhaylova L. Zichittella A.E. Arguello J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mutants were expressed in HeLa cells, and all but the Cys242-substituted mutants were able to support cell growth under ouabain-selective pressure. Although Cys242 does not appear to be located within the catalytic domains, it was concluded in their study that Cys242 is important for function, and that construction of a cysteine-less α-subunit would not be possible. Their conclusions are at odds with our findings, which clearly show that an entirely cysteine-less α-subunit is expressed and fully functional. One explanation to account for this would be that Cys242 plays a role in protein folding or trafficking, and that the expression system used in that study does not result in plasma membrane localization of this particular mutant protein. Our cysteine-less α-subunit, though fully functional, does appear to have altered properties in protein folding and/or assembly (Fig. 5, lanes 4–6). Using our expression system, it would be interesting to study the trafficking pattern and degradation of a protein in which Cys242 is introduced back into the cysteine-less background. Site-directed mutagenesis is a powerful tool that has been used in structure-function studies of membrane proteins by identifying individual residues important for structure and activity. The construction of cysteine-less membrane proteins, such as H+-ATPase (26Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28535-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), lactose permease (28van Iwaarden P.R. Pastore J.C. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R.

A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) has been reported and utilized to study the structure-function relationships of these important proteins. The total replacement of cysteine residues in the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit has enabled us to eliminate any important role for cysteine residues in the α-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase. We have shown here for the first time that the 23 native cysteine residues in the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit have no essential role in the protein and that these residues can all be simultaneously replaced without any deleterious effect on enzyme function. The successful expression of a cysteine-less Na,K-ATPase α-subunit should be useful for future structure-function studies where individual cysteine residues will be incorporated into different parts of the protein so that spectroscopic methods can be employed to obtain dynamic structure data.

https://openalex.org/W2026184228,"A 130-kDa glycoprotein (p130) has been found to be associated with surrogate light chain on pro- and pre-B I cells. Using peptide sequences obtained from purified p130 we have cloned its gene. The gene encodes a typical cadherin type 1 membrane protein with six extracellular cadherin domains (one pseudo domain) but lacking the catenin-binding site in its cytoplasmic part. Even without this catenin-binding site, p130 mediates Ca2+-dependent homotypic adhesion of cells. The interaction of p130 with surrogate light chain is confirmed by co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The expression of p130 is biphasic during the B cell development. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometric analyses revealed that it is expressed on B220+c-Kit+ pro-B and pre-B-I cells as well as on B220+CD25−IgM+ immature and mature B cells but not on B220+CD25+pre-B-II cells. It is also expressed in fetal liver, at low levels in myeloid cells, and strongly in intestinal epithelial cells. In the spleen, p130-expressing cells are mainly localized in the marginal zone. We call this B lineage-, intestine-, liver- and leukocyte-expressed gene BILL-cadherin. The possible functions of BILL-cadherin in B cell development are discussed.

The early development of B cell progenitors, the timing and the order of the Ig gene rearrangements, and the subsequent positive and negative selection of the newly emerging B cells are regulated by a programmed pattern of gene expression and by ordered interactions of different stages of B lineage cells with the bone marrow microenvironment (see reviews in Refs. 1Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar, 2Melchers F. Rolink A. Grawunder U. Winkler T.H. Karasuyama H. Ghia P. Andersson J. Curr. Opin.

The development of early precursor B cells (pro/pre-B-I) in bone marrow requires attachment to stromal cells, which involves interactions with Flk-2 and c-Kit on B lineage precursors and their corresponding ligands on stroma cells (6Ogawa M. Sugawara S. Kunisada T. Sudo T. Hayashi S. Nishikawa S. Kodama H. Exp. Hematol. 1998; 26: 478-488PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of progenitor B cells with the stromal cells induces the production of IL-7 by stromal cells (7Sudo T. Ito M. Ogawa Y. Iizuka M. Kodama H. Kunisada T. Hayashi S. Ogawa M. Sakai K. Nishikawa S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The IL-7 acts via IL-7 receptor on pro- and pre-B cells to allow their survival and proliferation, in concert with other interactions between the two lineage of cells (8Nishikawa S. Ogawa M. Kunisada T. Kodama H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1767-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Rolink A. Karasuyama H. Grawunder U. Haasner D. Kudo A. Melchers F. Eur. J.

Med. 1995; 181: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). In the adhesive pro/pre-B cell-stromal cell interactions, CD44 (Pgp-1), a receptor for hyaluronate, and the integrin VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) are involved (11Kincade P.W. He Q. Ishihara K. Miyake K. Lesley J. Hyman R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 184: 215-222PubMed Google Scholar). In the bone marrow, B cell precursors move from the peripheral region near the surrounding bone to the central sinusoids as they mature and differentiate (4Osmond D.G. Semin. Immunol. 1990; 2: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jacobsen K. Osmond D.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2395-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The chemokine stroma cell-derived factor-1 might play a role in this migration (13D'Apuzzo M. Rolink A. Loetscher M. Hoxie J.A. Clark-Lewis I. Melchers F. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). During this movement, differentiating B cells are thought to interact with various types of stromal cells. However, most of the molecular mechanisms responsible for these vectorial and sequential interactions remain to be elucidated. Other migrations occur during the generation of the peripheral B cell compartments. Immature B cells exit the bone marrow and enter the spleen through the central artery, the arteriole, and finally the marginal sinuses to become localized in the marginal zone and follicular areas (14Stevens S.K. Weissman I.L. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 844-851PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sprent J. Cell Immunol. 1973; 7: 10-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Chen X. Martin F. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Kearney J.F. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Again, almost nothing is known about the genes and the molecules that control these cellular migrations and selections. A 130-kDa glycoprotein, p130, has been found associated with surrogate light chain (SL chain)1 on pro-B and pre-B-I cells, which either have all Ig gene loci in germline configuration or are DHJH rearranged and hence do not yet express μ heavy chains. The SL chain is composed of the Vpre-B1 and λ5 proteins. Together with μ heavy chains, it can form pre-B cell receptors that become expressed in and on large VHDHJH rearranged pre-B cells (17Melchers F. Karasuyama H. Haasner D. Bauer S. Kudo A. Sakaguchi N. Jameson B. Rolink A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 60-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Pre-B cell receptors signal clonal expansion of these so-called large pre-B-II cells and are thought to be also involved in allelic exclusion of the H chain locus (9Rolink A. Karasuyama H. Grawunder U. Haasner D. Kudo A. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Melchers F. Karasuyama H. Haasner D. Bauer S. Kudo A. Sakaguchi N.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In pro-B, pre-B-I, and large pre-B-II cells, the majority of SL chain molecules are localized in the cytoplasm. However, small amounts are also found on the surface (21Winkler T.H. Rolink A. Melchers F. Karasuyama H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Shinkai Y. Young F. Alt F.W. Melchers F. Cell. 1994; 77: 133-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because pro-B and pre-B-I cells do not yet express μ heavy chains, other molecules might be associated with SL chain in these early B lineage cells to allow surface deposition (22Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Shinkai Y. Young F. Alt F.W. Melchers F. Cell. 1994; 77: 133-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A complex of glycoproteins (of 200, 130, and 105 kDa and several proteins between 35 and 65 kDa) have been found associated with SL chain on the surface of mouse pro-B and pre-B-I cell lines (23Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,24Shinjo F. Hardy R.R. Jongstra J. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A similar complex is also found on human pro-B cells in which the major component is a 125-kDa protein (25Sanz E. de la Hera A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we report the purification and partial amino acid sequence determination of the p130 molecule associated with SL chain. This, in turn, then allows the cloning of the gene encoding p130, which is found to be a new member of the cadherin family. We show that the expression of this nonclassic cadherin molecule is biphasic during the B cell ontogeny and that the expression in SL chain-producing cells allows the surface deposition of SL chain-p130 complexes. Female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (3–5-weeks old) were purchased from Biological Research Laboratories, Ltd. (Fuellinsdorf, Switzerland). 38B9 mouse pro-B cell line and most of the cell lines used here were described previously (23Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, murine leukemia virus transformed μ+κ− cell lines from BALB/c mice Ig6.3 (26Takemori T. Miyazoe I. Shirasawa T. Taniguchi M. Graf T. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the immature T cell lines SCFET27F, and B6.2.16.BU (27Saint-Ruf C. Ungewiss K. Groettrup M. Bruno L. Fehling H.J. von Boehmer H. Science. 1994; 266: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) were used. All cell lines were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol. Rat monoclonal antibodies used were LM34 and LM33 specific for mouse λ5 (23Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), M41 specific for murine μ heavy chain (28Leptin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1985; 15: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), 9EG7 (anti-β1-integrin, kindly provided by Dr. Beat Imhof), and M1/9.3.4 (anti-B220 (29Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3833-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). All other monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Pharmigen. The polyclonal anti-β1-integrin was kindly provided by B. Imhof. Isotope labeling of the cells, lysis, and subsequent immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (30Ohnishi K. Takemori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28347-28353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-labeled cells (5 × 107) were lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmiodoacetamide, and protease inhibitors. After a centrifugation, the supernatant was precleared with rabbit normal Ig-Sepharose conjugate and then immunoprecipitated with 20 μg of each antibody immobilized to Sepharose 4B. Samples were washed three times and analyzed on the one-dimensional and/or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (30Ohnishi K. Takemori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28347-28353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 100 pmol (10 μg) of p130 was purified from 5 × 1011 of 38B9 (pro-B) cells by several batches of the purification steps as described below. 38B9 (2.5 × 1010) cells were lysed with 250 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 20 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 1 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamide, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) on ice for 10 min. As the tracer for λ5-associated p130, anti-λ5 immunoprecipitate from125I-labeled 38B9 cells were added to the final batch of the purification. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation (105,000 × g). The supernatant was incubated with 1-ml gel of RCA120-Sepharose (Ricinus communisagglutinin, Sigma L-2390) at 4 °C overnight. The RCA120-Sepharose bound samples were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and eluted with 0.5 m galactose/2 m NaCl in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 4 °C for 4 h. The eluate was stored at −20 °C as RCA120 fraction. The RCA120 fractions from 5 × 1011 cells were pooled, and the proteins were precipitated by the method of Wessel and Flugge (31Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). The proteins were then solubilized with the buffer A (8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% CHAPS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA). After a passage through a 0.2-μm filter, the sample was loaded on Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted in a gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m NaCl in buffer A). As the fractions corresponding to 0.5–0.6 m NaCl contained p130, these fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm(NH4)2CO3, and lyophilized. The lyophilized sample was dissolved with the sample buffer of NEPHGE, cleared by a centrifugation, and subjected to NEPHGE/SDS-PAGE as described previously (30Ohnishi K. Takemori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28347-28353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Ponseau S. The spot corresponding to p130 was identified with125I-labeled p130 protein, which was immuno-co-precipitated with anti-λ5 antibody, cut out, and analyzed as described below. The 130-kDa protein containing polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which separated as above, was rendered to the digestion with lysine-C. The digestion, separation on HPLC, MALD-MS of the HPLC fractions, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the peptides were performed by Dr. William S. Lane's Laboratory (Harvard microchemistry facility) and the facility in our Institute. The design of the gene-specific oligonucleotide PCR primers (p130pk37sens, 5′-AARATYGTBCARGGNGA-3′; p130pk37anti, 5′-GCRTTIGTIGTDGGRTCNGT-3′) was based on the N-terminal six amino acids and seven C-terminal amino acids of peak-37 peptide ((K)IVQGDTEXRLEVVTDPTTNA) using a preferred codon usage in the rabbit. The PCRs were “hot started” and subjected to the thermal cycles as follows: one cycle of 10 s at 96 °C, 30 cycles of (5 s at 96 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C), and one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min using OmniGene thermal cycler (HYBAID Limited, Middlesex, UK). PCR products were size fractionated on a 3% agarose gel and transferred to nylon filters (Zeta-Probe membrane, Bio-Rad). PCR products that hybridized to the 32P-end-labeled internal, gene-specific oligonucleotide probes p130pk37 m(5′-ACNGARIIINGIYTIGARTIGTIAC-3′) were identified and subcloned into the pCRTMII vector using the TA CloningTMsystem (Invitrogen Corp.). From the deduced sequence, the primers p130pk37–3′ (5′-AAGATTGTACAGGGAGA-3′) and p130pk37–5′ (5′-TGGGATCTGTGACAAC-3′) were designed for MarathonTM cDNA amplification method (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, California), and RACE-PCR (32Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar) was performed according to the protocol from the company. The amplified products were size fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel and subcloned into the pCRTMII vector. To obtain longer fragment, p130RACE-5′ (5′-AATAACTCACAGTCAGGCCTTCAGGAT-3′) and p130RACE-3′ (5′- ACACAGACATCGGATCCACCATCCTAA-3′) were used in place of p130pk37–5′ and p130pk37–3′, respectively, and ExpandTM High Fidelity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. The amplified fragments were cloned into pCR-ScriptTM(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced as described below. In parallel, the λgt10 38B9 cDNA library was screened by the plaque-lift method with a 32P-labeled 0.2-kilobase PCR product (Hpk37) amplified using Hpk37s (5′-GACACAGCCATCGGATC-3′) and Hpk37a (5′-TGGGATCTGTGACAAC-3′) as the primers after the method described in Ref. 33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. cDNA clones were recovered from positive λgt10 plaques and cloned into pBluescript II SK−. DNA sequence analysis of cDNA inserts were performed by the Taq DyeDeoxyTM Terminator Cycle sequencing method using an automated sequencer (model 373A, Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Total RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues and from various cell lines by a modification of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels containing 0.67% formaldehyde, transferred to nylon filters (Zeta-Probe membrane, Bio-Rad), prehybridized, and hybridized with 32P-labeled Hpk37 fragment for 24 h at 68 °C. Filters were washed in 2× SSC containing 0.02% SDS for 30 min at room temperature and then 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C. The filters were then autoradiographed on a film or analyzed by a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR on cell lines and sorted cells was performed basically as described previously (35Grawunder U. Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Werner A. Rolink A.G. Melchers F. Winkler T.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 601-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from sorted 3 × 103 cells and reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). RT-PCR assays were carried out with the series of template dilutions to obtain a linear correlation between input template and PCR product. The primer pairs used are as follows; p130, 5′-GCACTTCATTCACATCCGTCA-3′ and 5′-GCTAACAACATCAACAGTATTTTG-3′; HPRT, 5′-GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3′ and 5′-CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3′; λ5, 5′-GAGATCTAGACTGCAAGTGAGGCTAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGGGCTGACCTAGGATTG-3′. The PCR products are examined by Southern blot using the probe as described above (p130) and previously (HPRT, λ5 (35Grawunder U. Leu T.M. Schatz D.G. Werner A. Rolink A.G. Melchers F. Winkler T.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 601-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). The hybridization signals were quantitated by the PhosphoImager equipped with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The relative contents of the messages in each cell and tissue were normalized by HPRT and estimated from the linear region of the template dilutionversus PCR product plot. X63.Ag8.653 cell line transfected with Vpre-B1 and λ5 cDNA, X63/Vpre-B1/λ5, was described previously (36Karasuyama H. Kudo A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and maintained in 1 mg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Supertransfection of X63.Ag8.653 was carried out as follows. Full-length cDNA of p130 was cloned intoXhoI site of retrovirus vector, LXSP. LXSP is a derivative of LXSN (37Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7 (, 984–986, 989–990): 980-982PubMed Google Scholar), in which puromycin resistant gene was introduced in place of neomycin resistant gene. LXSP/p130 was linearized by PvuI cut and transfected into packaging cell line, gp+E- (38Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by DOTAP method (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After the selection of LXSP/p130 transfected gp+E-86 cells with 3 μg/ml puromycin, the cells were cultured to confluent monolayer, γ-irradiated with 3000R and the X63/Vpre-B1/λ5 cells were overlaid for overnight without addition of puromycin. After the selection with 3–6 μg/ml puromycin, the transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution. Culture, transfection, and cloning of Drosophila Schneider cells (SL-3) were performed according to Ref. 39Wallny H.J. Sollami G. Karjalainen K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. Briefly, p130 cDNA was cloned into pRmHa-3 (40Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) under the control of metallothionein promoter and transfected into SL-3 cells with phshs-puro (containing the puromycin resistance gene under the heat shock promoter; a kind gift of K. Karjalainen, Basel Institute for Immunology) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). After the selection with 6 μg/ml puromycin, cells were tested for the aggregation according to Berndorff et al. (41Berndorff D. Gessner R. Kreft B. Schnoy N. Lajous-Petter A.M. Loch N. Reutter W. Hortsch M. Tauber R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1353-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The surrogate light chain is expressed on the cell surface of pro-B cells in mouse bone marrow as well as pro-B cell lines such as 38B9 and 63-12 in the absence of μ heavy chains (23Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cell surface iodination and subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-λ5 or anti-Vpre-B1 antibody revealed that 130- and 35–65-kDa molecules are the main components that appear associated in a complex with SL chain (Fig.1 A). The two-dimensional gel patterns show that p130 is a slightly acidic protein (pI = ∼5.8), whereas the 33–65-kDa molecules are relatively neutral (pI = ∼5–7). The 130- and 35–65-kDa molecules are glycoproteins. Hence, deglycosylation of the complex with PNGase F gave rise to a 100-kDa protein and several 30–45-kDa proteins of slightly different neutral pIs. The differential SDS-PAGE analysis under nonreducing versus reducing conditions revealed no differences in migration of the 100- and 30–45-kDa deglycosylated components, indicating that they are not disulfide-linked (23Karasuyama H. Rolink A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The association of the glycosylated 35–65-kDa molecules appears to be more ubiquitous because they are also co-precipitated, for example, in complexes with anti-B220 mAb in which SL chain and p130 are not found (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, we chose the 130-kDa molecule (subsequently referred to as p130) as the most probable protein partner of SL chain on pro-B and pre-B-I cells.Figure 1The surrogate light chain containing complex on pro-B cell line and the purification of the 130-kDa component. A, murine leukemia virus -transformed pro-B cell line, 38B9, was surface iodinated with 125I, lysed by Nonidet P-40 (1%), and immunoprecipitated with anti-λ5 (LM34) antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE/SDS-PAGE; the pH range of the first dimension is about 4–10, and the second dimension is 6–20% gradient gel). The positions of the 130-kDa component (p130), λ5, and Vpre-B1 are indicated.B, the comparison of immunoprecipitates from 38B9 pro-B cell line. After the surface iodination and the lysis with 1% Nonidet P-40, proteins were immunoprecipitated with rat normal-Ig, anti-λ5 (LM34), anti-CD16/CD32 (2.4G2), anti-B220 (CD45, M1/9.3.4), anti-β1-integrin (polyclonal), and anti-α4-integrin (polyclonal). The samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (6–20% gradient gel). The positions of p130, λ5, and Vpre-B1 are indicated at the right. C, The partially purified p130 fraction. An aliquot from the p130 containing fraction of HPLC (Mono-Q, to which RCA120-bound proteins from 38B9 was loaded) was mixed with the tracer (125I-labeled LM34 immunoprecipitates) and analyzed on NEPHGE/SDS-PAGE. The proteins were detected by silver stain. The positions of p130 and Vpre-B1 were located by the125I-labeled tracer. The large spot of p130 was cut out and analyzed further. D, the elution profile of the reverse phase HPLC on which lysine-C-digested proteins from the p130 spot were loaded. The arbitrary chosen peaks were analyzed by MALD-MS to obtain the peptide of unknown mass. One of the peptides with unknown mass is indicated (pk37). E, the MALD-MS profile of peak 37. This fragment gave the longest unknown sequence as IVQGDTEXRLEVVTDPTTNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To purify sufficient quantities of p130 that could be entered into an amino acid sequence analysis, 5 × 1011 38B9 pro-B cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and absorbed with ricin-lectin (RCA120-agarose). Bound material was eluted with 0.5 m galactose, then loaded on a Mono-Q column, and eluted with an NaCl gradient. p130 was eluted around 0.5 mNaCl (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The purity of the eluted fraction containing p130 was estimated to be about 50%. As revealed by a comparison of the two-dimensional NEPHGE/SDS-PAGE gel of the fraction where protein was detected by silver staining (Fig.1 C), with the spot corresponding to p130 as it could be identified by co-electrophoresed 125I-labeled p130 tracer protein, which is immunoprecipitated with anti-λ5 from the iodinated same cell line. The p130 spot appeared fairly isolated from other spots on the gel. Consequently it was blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, subjected to lysine-C digestion, and the resulting peptides were separated on reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 1 D). The amino acid sequences of some of the isolated peaks were determined (TableI). It became evident from this analysis that the p130 spot represented a mixture of β1-integrin and an unknown, p130 protein.Table IAmino acid sequences obtained from partially purified p130Cadherin-like sequencesIVQGDTEXRLEVVDPTTNAFXGPLKGMGDGLLYHTRTNPPXVTDINDNRPβ1-IntegrinSAVGTLSGDSSNVIQLIIDAYNSLSSEVILSENNIQTIFAVTEEFKDKPQISEKPALWDTGENPIYKα6-IntegrinDIALEITVUnknownTVTADEEKEp130 corresponding spot on two-dimensional gel was excised, treated with Lys-C, separated on reverse phase HPLC, and sequenced by Edman Degradation (see “Experimental Procedures” for the details).

Open table in a new tab p130 corresponding spot on two-dimensional gel was excised, treated with Lys-C, separated on reverse phase HPLC, and sequenced by Edman Degradation (see “Experimental Procedures” for the details). All these peptides showed intrinsic molecular mass values different from those predicted in β1-integrin. Because β1-integrin is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa that can be deglycosylated to a 100-kDa core protein, we tested its capacity to associate with SL chain. However, a mAb specific for β1-integrin co-precipitated neither Vpre-B1, λ5 nor the 35–65-kDa molecules from the 125I-labeled pro-B cell line (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, a mAb specific for α6-integrin (which is associated with β1-integrin on the pro-B cell line), proved also unable to co-precipitate Vpre-B1 and λ5. Moreover, the 130-kDa spot of β1-integrin on two-dimensional gel exhibited a slightly different mobility on two-dimensional gel when compared with the SL chain-associated p130 spot (data not shown). These facts were taken as an indication that it was not β1-integrin but the unknown p130 protein that was capable of association with SL chain. Five of six unknown sequences with no sequence relationship to β1-integrin showed significant homologies to cadherin molecules (Table I). One of the amino acid sequences obtained from the unknown, cadherin-like p130 material, IVQGDTEXRLEVVTDPTTNA from peak 37 (Fig. 1,D and E), was long enough to design PCR primers with which the cloning of p130 cDNA could be attempted using the RACE technique (see “Experimental Procedures”). By repeating the RACE-PCR with a 38B9 cell cDNA library, we were able to obtain a full-length cDNA sequence of p130 (Fig.2). The cDNA sequence has one lo"

M., Haltiwanger, B. M., and Taraschi, T. F. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17216–17220). In this investigation, we further characterized the interaction of the RIP gelonin with single-stranded oligonucleotides and investigated its activity on double-stranded oligonucleotides. At physiological pH, zinc and β-mercaptoethanol stimulated the adenine DNA glycosylase activity of gelonin. Under these conditions, gelonin catalytically removed adenine from single-stranded DNA and, albeit to a lesser extent, from normal base pairs and mismatches in duplex DNA. Also unprecedented was the finding that activity on single-stranded and double-stranded oligonucleotides containing multiple adenines generated unstable products with several abasic sites, producing strand breakage and duplex melting, respectively. The results from competition experiments suggested similar interactions between gelonin's DNA-binding domain and oligonucleotides with and without adenine. A re-examination of the classification of gelonin as a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase using the borohydride trapping assay revealed that gelonin was similar to the DNA glycosylase MutY: both enzymes are monofunctional glycosylases, which are trappable to their DNA substrates. The k catfor the removal of adenine from single-stranded DNA was close to the values observed with multisubstrate DNA glycosylases, suggesting that the activity of RIPs on DNA may be physiologically relevant. We reported that plant ribosome inactivating proteins (RIP) have a unique DNA glycosylase activity that removes adenine from single-stranded DNA (Nicolas, E., Beggs, J. M., Haltiwanger, B.

In vitro studies in search of alternative substrates that may be damaged by these enzymes revealed that they possess a single-stranded adenine DNA glycosylase activity (6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M.

While there is still no direct evidence that this activity is physiologically relevant in plants or contributes to cytotoxicity, the ability of RIPs to damage DNA by removal of normal, non-mispaired bases in vitro distinguished them from the other members of the DNA glycosylase family, which protect the genome by removing potentially cytotoxic or mutagenic bases (7Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 8David S.S. Williams S.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1221-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). If the number of DNA lesions produced overwhelmed the DNA repair capacity of the cell or organism, the adenine glycosylase activity of the RIPs could be mutagenic or lethal. Recognition of the adenine DNA glycosylase activity of RIPs has been somewhat slow due to confusion in the literature, issues of possible contamination by nucleases, and the requirement of high protein/DNA ratio for activity (9Perentesis J.P.

In search of an enzyme classification that encompassed the removal of adenine from RNA and DNA, these investigators redefined RIPs as polynucleotide:adenosine nucleosidases (11Barbieri L. Gorini P. Valbonesi P. Castiglioni P. Stirpe F. Nature. 1994; 372: 624Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or polynucleotide:adenosine glycosidases (12Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P.

Gelonin, PAP, and ricin were demonstrated to have an adenine DNA glycosylase activity on single-stranded DNA (6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We suggested that this new classification was more appropriate than those used in Refs. 11Barbieri L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar were partly based on results obtained using a borohydride trapping assay (16Sun B. Latham K.A.

Issues of the possible contamination of RIPs by nucleases were addressed by zymography using naturally occurring RIPs and purified bacterial recombinant forms (21Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Gorini P. Pession A. Stirpe F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The requirement for high protein/DNA ratios for activity on DNA may be a property of these proteins or could be due to the fact that, due to the newness of the discovery, the experimental conditions for the assay are not optimal. Barbieriet al. (12Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) reported that the removal of adenine from DNA proceeded without cofactors, at low ionic strength, in the absence of Mg2+ and K+, with an optimal pH value of 4.0 (22Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our laboratory found that the adenine DNA glycosylase of gelonin, PAP, and ricin was stimulated by zinc at physiological pH (6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies undertaken to date to measure the rate of adenine removal from DNA utilized macromolecular substrates only (22Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), rather than the single target oligonucleotides classically used for the characterization of DNA glycosylases. The simultaneous or consecutive splitting of many N-glycosidic bonds that occurred using the macromolecular substrates resulted in complicated kinetics (22Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and precluded any comparison with the DNA glycosylases. Many fundamental questions about the DNA glycosylase activity of the RIPs also require further investigation. These include whether the removal of adenines is the primary event that leads to DNA breakage, whether the breakage is RIP-mediated, and whether the activity is limited to the single-stranded regions of supercoiled DNA or also affects double-stranded DNA. In this investigation, we characterize the adenine DNA glycosylase activity of gelonin using assays and substrates (e.g. a single-target-containing oligonucleotide) that are routinely used to characterize classical DNA glycosylases. We now characterize the kinetics of the glycosylase activity of gelonin on these substrates under different buffer conditions and revisit our previous conclusion that gelonin has an associated AP lyase activity. In addition, we address the question of an unusual specificity for a widely available target (e.g. adenine) by studying the activity of gelonin on single-stranded and double-stranded oligonucleotides containing multiple adenines. The results clarify some of the confusing data described above and reveal more features that make the RIPs unusual glycosylases. Insight into the molecular mechanisms of adenine removal from DNA and the DNA cleavage that can accompany it is also provided. Plant gelonin was purchased from Sigma and resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and used within 3 weeks post-hydration. The wild type recombinant gelonin (rGel) and the mutants (rGel(C44A) and rGel(C50A)) were gifts from Drs. Stephen Carroll and Mark Better from the XOMA Corp. The production and characterization of these proteins has been previously described (23Better M. Bernhard S.L. Fishwild D.M. Nolan P.A. Bauer R.J. Kung A.H.C. Carroll S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9644-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA™ protein assay reagent from Pierce (Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) were prepared by the Nucleic Acid Facility at Thomas Jefferson University and further purified by preparative gel electrophoresis before use. After gel purification, the ODN were concentrated using Centricon YM-3 filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The concentration was measured spectrophotometrically. The ODN 5′-GTTGGGTCTCGCCTGGGTTTTCCCAGTC-3′, referred to as 28GR-A25 in Ref. 6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, was renamed ssA25 in this investigation. ssU25 contained uracil in place of A at position 25 from the 5′ end. ssAP25, which contained an AP site at position 25 from the 5′ end, was created by treatment of ssU25 with the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG; New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, CA). The ODN CssA25 5′-GACTGGGAAAACCCAGGCGAGACCCAAC-3′, complementary to ssA25, was used as the multiple adenine-containing substrate. 5′-32P-End labeling was performed using [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Sciences, Boston, MA)) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) as described in Ref. 6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. Duplex substrates were produced by annealing ssA25 and CssA25 according to standard procedures and purification by electrophoresis under native conditions. The reactions were initiated by mixing the ODN substrate and gelonin in a 10-μl total volume of buffer I (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 μm ZnCl2), buffer II (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mmZnCl2, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), or buffer III (10 mm MES, pH 5.0, 1.0 mm EDTA). Unless indicated, the concentration of gelonin was 10−7m. Substrate concentrations varied from 5 × 10−8m to 10−5m as indicated in the figure legends. 5′-32P-End-labeled substrate was added as a tracer (60 fmol, 1.25 × 105 cpm/reaction). In the competition experiments, the unlabeled substrate was replaced by an equal amount of ssU25. At the end of the desired incubation times indicated in the figure legends, the samples were post-treated either with alkali (0.2 n NaOH, 40 mm EDTA, 70 °C) when the substrate contained a single adenine, or with a reducing agent (100 mm NaBH4, 15 min on ice) when the substrate contained multiple adenines. Assays were terminated by the addition of formamide loading dye and neutralization with HCl. Substrate and product(s) were resolved by gel electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The distribution of the radiolabeled species in the gel was determined using a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software. Buffer II was used to determine the enzyme kinetics. Reactions, done in triplicate, contained the enzyme at 0.1 μm and the substrate ssA25 at concentrations varying from 0.5 to 10.0 μm and were stopped after 2 min. A double-reciprocal plot of the initial rateversus ODN concentration allowed the determination ofK m and V max. The catalytic constant (k cat) was calculated as the ratio ofV max to the enzyme concentration used (10−7m). The glycosylase reaction buffer used above was supplemented with the desired concentration of NaCl, NaCNBH3, or NaBH4. After various times as indicated in the figure caption, the assays were terminated by addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After elimination of the lower part of the gel that contained the free oligonucleotide, the distribution of the isotope on the gel was determined by PhosphorImager analysis. The autoradiograms were processed with Adobe Photoshop 5.0. We previously described the design of an oligonucleotide substrate and a method to study qualitatively the adenine DNA glycosylase activity of gelonin (6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The same 28-mer ODN containing a single adenine at position 25 was used to determine the enzyme kinetics of gelonin. The effect of different buffering conditions on gelonin's DNA glycosylase activity was investigated. In addition to the buffer conditions we previously used (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 μmZnCl2 (buffer I)) in Ref. 6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, we found that 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm ZnCl2, 2% β-mercaptoethanol (βME) (buffer II) or 10 mm MES, pH 5.0, 1 mm EDTA (buffer III) also supported the glycosylase activity. The DNA glycosylase activity obtained with these different conditions as a function of substrate concentration is shown in the autoradiogram of the denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig.1 A). The slower electrophoretic mobility of the product that was observed in buffer II was due to inhibition of δ-elimination by βME (24Bailly V. Verly W.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9489-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The difference in the processing of the substrate in the three conditions was so remarkable that it could be ascertained without processing of the autoradiogram. The most striking difference was observed in conditions of multiple turnover ([protein] < [DNA]): at pH 7.0, in the presence of zinc, the addition of βME allowed more facile turnover so that, at a 1:50 protein/DNA ratio (mol:mol), the degradation of substrate increased from <5 to ∼60%. To avoid experimental artifacts, which can be associated with measurement of activity after a set time, the time course of the reaction was studied. Two enzyme/ODN ratios (1 or 0.02) were used (Fig. 1 B). At equimolar ratio, both buffers II and III allowed a rapid, total conversion of substrate to product. In buffer I and III at a 1:50 ratio, the low but steady progression of a degradation product suggested that the poor processing of the substrate by gelonin was not due to a single turnover mechanism as observed for the DNA glycosylase TDG (25Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Due to the extremely inefficient turnover, buffer I and III could not be used for the determination of standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics parameters. Fig. 1 C examined the effect of varying the gelonin concentration (10−9 to 10−7m), at an equimolar gelonin/DNA ratio, on the glycosylase activity during a 2-min incubation in buffer II. The results showed that the relative rate of reaction was concentration dependent, suggesting that in the lower concentration range substrate binding was a limiting factor. As a result, a concentration of gelonin of 10−7mwas used throughout the rest of the investigation. Having defined experimental conditions that allowed efficient processing of the DNA substrate, we measured the kinetic parameters k cat andK m of the reaction. Fig.2 shows the concentration of abasic DNA produced in 2 min by 10−7m gelonin plotted against the concentration of the substrate ssA25. Adenine excision by gelonin is shown to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. From the double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus substrate concentration, k cat and K mwere estimated at 8.3 min−1 and 1.7 μm, respectively. Gelonin possesses two cysteines in positions 44 and 50 linked by a disulfide bridge (23Better M. Bernhard S.L. Fishwild D.M. Nolan P.A. Bauer R.J. Kung A.H.C. Carroll S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9644-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of βME described above suggested that the low turnover efficiency observed in buffer I could be due to the disulfide bridge and that it might be possible to increase the glycosylase activity by eliminating the bridge by genetic mutation. Such an approach has been used with the RIP MAP from Mirabilis: the inhibitory activity on protein synthesis of the mutant C36S/C220S, in which the disulfide bridge was eliminated was approximately 22 times higher than that of native MAP (26Habuka N. Miyano M. Kataoka J. Tsuge H. Ago H. Noma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23558-23560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the disulfide bridge between cysteines 44 and 50 in the low efficiency turnover of gelonin in buffer I, we compared the activity of the gelonin mutants C44A and C50A to that of the wild type recombinant enzyme (Fig.3). The results with the recombinant wild type protein indicated that the low turnover in buffer I and the stimulation of the activity by βME were intrinsic properties of gelonin, since they were observed with both the native (Fig. 1) and recombinant (Fig. 3) proteins. The elimination of the disulfide bridge had no effect on the gelonin turnover in buffer I, suggesting that the mechanism of stimulation by βME was not through modification of the protein. The elimination of these cysteines also had no effect on gelonin's ability to inhibit protein synthesis (23Better M. Bernhard S.L. Fishwild D.M. Nolan P.A. Bauer R.J. Kung A.H.C. Carroll S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9644-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA glycosylase/AP lyases are glycosylases with an associated β-elimination activity that results in DNA strand breakage. A unifying hypothesis that rationalizes the apparent distinction between the two classes of glycosylases (glycosylase or glycosylase/AP lyase) has been proposed (16Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Llyod R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The bifurcation is in the catalytic mechanism, i.e. the type of nucleophile that attacks C-1′ of the damaged base nucleoside. Bifunctional glycosylases utilize an amine nucleophile from the enzyme, while monofunctional glycosylases use a nucleophile derived from the medium. The hypothesis of a unified catalytic mechanism seemed to be supported by the borohydride-trapping assay, the principle of which is that only bifunctional glycosylases form a trappable complex with their substrate (16Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Llyod R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In our previous paper (6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the trapping assay with an oligonucleotide substrate was used to investigate the possibility that gelonin had an associated AP lyase activity, which was suggested by the cleavage of a single-stranded DNA fragment (∼800 bases) by gelonin, PAP, or ricin. We suggested that RIPs appeared unusual in that, while they formed a borohydride-trappable complex classifying them as DNA glycosylase/AP lyases (24Bailly V. Verly W.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9489-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), they could not be distinguished from monofunctional glycosylases in a strand cleavage assay using a short (28-mer) ODN substrate, since post-treatment was necessary to break the DNA at the resulting abasic site. Similar behavior was subsequently reported for the adenine DNA glycosylase, MutY, whose classification has long been a matter of controversy (17Williams S.D. David S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12384-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Williams S.D. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15417-15424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was concluded from a kinetic analysis that the slow dissociation rate of MutY from its product was suggestive of specific contacts with DNA that persisted after base removal. These contacts may result in borohydride-trappable complex formation independent of a lyase activity. These results and the observations reported in Fig. 1 prompted us to reinvestigate the origin of the gelonin-ODN complex observed in the presence of NaBH4. In particular, we investigated the formation of a trappable complex in buffer II, which supported a more efficient enzyme turnover. We (6Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17216-17220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and others (17Williams S.D. David S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have noted that the experimental conditions for the trapping assay may not be as straightforward as proposed in the initial paper (16Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Llyod R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), mainly because of the hypersensitivity of some glycosylases to salt. In Fig.4, we compared the effect of NaCl on the glycosylase activity of gelonin in buffers I and II. Fig. 4 Arevealed that the glycosylase activity of gelonin was less sensitive to increasing salt concentration in buffer II than in buffer I, suggesting that it was stabilized by stronger ionic interactions and/or additional hydrophobic interactions. From these results, 25 mm was selected as the concentration of reducing agent to be used in the trapping assay. A kinetic analysis of the glycosylase activity (Fig.4 B, upper panel) and of the formation of a gelonin-ODN complex (Fig. 4 B, lower panel) in the presence of 25 mm NaCNBH3 was performed.While the total removal of adenine was accomplished in 5 min, the intensity of the signal corresponding to the ODN-gelonin complex increased over the 30-min time course of the assay. No complex formation was observed when 25 mm NaCNBH3 was replaced by 25 mm NaCl (data not shown). NaBH4, a stronger reducing agent than NaCNBH3, which usually produces more effective glycosylase-DNA cross-linking (20Williams S.D. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15417-15424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was also inefficient in cross-linking gelonin to its ODN substrate when added at 25 mm during the glycosylase reaction (data not shown). Our interpretation of the absence of parallelism between the two curves was that the gelonin-ODN complex formed slowly after base removal as a result of a fortuitous encounter between a lysine and the abasic site. Using NaCNBH3 instead of NaBH4 increased the efficiency of cross-linking, because the former did not simultaneously reduce the preformed aldehydes and therefore did not inactivate the substrate. The interaction of gelonin with the abasic site was further probed by determining the conditions for the formation of a complex with an ODN with a preformed abasic site. Fig. 4C (lanes 1–4) shows that, provided that the concentration of reducing agent was reduced to 10 mm, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig.4 A, complex formation was detectable, although highly reduced, in the absence of zinc and βME. Complex formation was progressively inhibited by the addition of increasing concentrations of EDTA (lanes 5 and 6). Fig. 5 shows the glycosylase activity, as a function of time, of gelonin on the ODN CssA25 that contained multiple adenines. Despite the fact that the samples were analyzed without alkali post-treatment (lanes 2–6), smears indicative of extensive DNA degradation were observed even at the shortest time of incubation (5 min). Electrophoresis in Tris buffer can cause breakage of the backbone of DNA containing abasic sites (27Povirk L.F. Houlgrave C.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 380-385Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Ray T. Mills R.T. Dyson P. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); this can be prevented by stabilization of the abasic sites with NaBH4. To verify that the smears were due to creation of abasic sites by gelonin and determine whether the degradation was produced by gelonin during the incu"

The interaction studies carried out with CGB and glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of intraluminal loop regions of bovine type 1 IP3R showed that CGB interacts with intraluminal loop 3-2 (the second loop formed between transmembrane regions 5 and 6) of the IP3R at both pH 5.5 and 7.5. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies also indicated that CGB interacts with the same intraluminal loop region of the IP3R and the interaction was much stronger than that between CGA and the loop. Moreover, the conserved near N-terminal region of CGB also interacted with the intraluminal loop region of the IP3R. The CGB interaction with the IP3R intraluminal loop peptide at pH 7.5 showed a ΔG 0 value of −8.1 kcal/mol at 37 °C for a 1:1 stoichiometry, indicating a Kd of ∼1.9 μm.

Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store role of the secretory granules has also been demonstrated in the zymogen granules of pancreatic acinar cells (2Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and in the secretory granules of goblet cells (3Nguyen T. Chin W.-C. Verdugo P. Nature. 1998; 395: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also shown that the IP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release in the pancreatic β-cells was severely reduced in the annexin 7 heterozygous (+/−) knockout mouse (4Srivastava M.

The level of IP3R expression in the secretory granules of pancreatic β-cells in the annexin 7 heterozygous (+/−) knockout mouse was only one-tenth that of normal littermates (4Srivastava M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both CGA and CGB bind to the secretory vesicle membrane (11Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8213-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8680-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but CGB binds much more strongly than CGA (12Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8680-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unlike CGA, which was dissociated from the secretory vesicle membrane by a simple pH change of the elution buffer from the intravesicular pH 5.5 to the near physiological pH 7.5 (11Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8213-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), CGB dissociation required both the pH change of the elution buffer and a high salt concentration (1 mKCl) (12Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8680-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, CGA has been demonstrated to interact with several secretory vesicle integral membrane proteins, including the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), at pH 5.5 and is dissociated from them at pH 7.5 (13Yoo S.H.

However, despite the monomeric existence of CGB and the dimeric or tetrameric existence of CGA, an equimolar mixture of CGB and CGA formed a heterodimer at pH 7.5 and a CGA2CGB2 heterotetramer at pH 5.5, leaving very little CGA homodimer or CGA homotetramer in the solution (23Yoo S.H.

A detailed study indicated that tetrameric CGA interacts with four molecules of the intraluminal loop region of the IP3R at pH 5.5 (24Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The IP3Rs are supposed to have six transmembrane domains, resulting in four intraluminal loops (25Michikawa T. Hamanaka H.

The conserved near N-terminal region of CGA and CGB has previously been suggested as the membrane-binding anchor region (11Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8213-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Yoo S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The disulfide-bonded loop form of the same region has also been reported to be important in CGA dimerization (21Thiele C. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in CGB sorting (28Kromer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Further, the conserved near N-terminal region of CGA was shown to interact with an intraluminal loop region of the IP3R (29Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), probably revealing the interacting domains of two proteins. In our recent study, we have demonstrated direct interaction between purified IP3R and chromogranins A and B (30Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol.

Not only did cotransfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate the existence of IP3R-CGA or IP3R-CGB complex in the cell, but also the immunogold electron microscopic study showed the colocalization of IP3R and CGA in the secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (30Yoo S.H.

In light of the interaction of CGB with purified IP3R (30Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it was of immediate interest to determine not only the interacting regions of CGB and IP3R but the interaction strengths as well. Therefore, we have investigated the potential interaction of the intraluminal loop region of the IP3R with both intact CGB and the conserved near N-terminal CGB region in the present study and found that intact CGB as well as the conserved near N-terminal region of CGB interact with the intraluminal loop region of the IP3R. To construct GST fusion proteins, DNA sequences corresponding to three intraluminal loops of bovine type I IP3R (Fig. 1), L1 (between transmembrane region 1 (TM1) and TM2), L2 (between TM3 and TM4), L3-1 (the first loop between TM5 and TM6), and L3-2 (the second loop between TM5 and TM6) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into expression vector pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells and purified on glutathione-agarose beads. The interaction of these proteins with CGB was carried out by incubating 10 μg each of GST fusion proteins with 2.5 μg of purified recombinant CGB prepared as described before (31Yoo S.H. Kang Y.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in a pH 5.5 buffer (20 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1 m KCl, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or in a pH 7.5 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then washed five times with the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove the unbound proteins. The remaining proteins, including the bound CGB, were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining. Chromogranin B was purified from bovine adrenal chromaffin granules in native form according to the method described previously (12Yoo S.H.

The use of 5-OH Trp is necessary, since differentiation of these two species in the ultracentrifugal analysis requires that the two reactants have significantly different absorption spectra. The synthesized peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and the integrity of the peptide of the peptide was ensured by amino acid composition analysis. The purity of the peptides was in excess of 98%. The molecular masses of intact chromogranin B, the CGB peptide, and the IP3R peptide, calculated from the amino acid sequences (31Yoo S.H. Kang Y.K.

Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17041-17046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 20,000 rpm and over the temperature range of 2–32 °C with 3 °C increments for intact CGB and the IP3R peptide interaction study and at 42,000 rpm and over the temperature range of 6–30 °C with 4 °C increments for the CGB peptide and the IP3R peptide interaction study. Three cells with six-channel centerpieces were used, one cell for each type of buffer. In each cell, the upper compartment contained intact CGB or the CGB peptide, the lower compartment contained the IP3R peptide, and the center compartment contained a mixture of intact CGB or the CGB peptide and the IP3R peptide having the same concentrations that they had in their respective compartments. The compartment adjoining each sample contained the reference buffer. Sample volumes were 0.12 ml, giving column heights of approximately 3 mm. The buffer used was 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.1m KCl, and 1 mm EGTA to ensure the absence of any Ca2+ effect. The compositional partial specific volume, υ¯, were calculated for 25 °C from the amino acid sequences using the consensus values of Perkins (36Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). A value of Δυ¯/ΔT = 0.000425 cm3 g−1degrees−1 was used to calculate the values of υ¯ at other temperatures. The extinction coefficients of CGB and the peptides at 280 nm were determined spectrophotometrically, and the extinction coefficients at 295, 300, and 310 nm were calculated from the ratios of the concentration gradients at equilibrium measured at that wavelength to the concentration gradients measured at 280 nm. Scans were taken at 280, 295, and 310 nm when the CGB peptide-IP3R peptide interaction was studied and at 280 and 300 nm when the CGB-IP3R peptide interaction was studied in order to obtain more rigorous analyses. The data were analyzed by a simplified version of the multiwavelength procedure (37Lewis M.S. Shrager R.I. Kim S.-J. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation : Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymer Systems. Birkhäuser Boston, Inc., Boston1994: 94-118Crossref Google Scholar). Given that the intravesicular protein CGA or CGB can come in contact with the integral vesicle membrane protein IP3R only through the intraluminal loop regions of the IP3R and that CGA has already been shown to interact with one of the intraluminal loop regions of the IP3R (24Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we have constructed GST fusion proteins of the intraluminal loop regions of bovine IP3R1 (Fig. 1) and examined the potential interaction of these loop regions with CGB (Fig.2). As shown in Fig. 2, the loop L3-2 (Fig. 1), which contains the conserved sequence DVLRKPSKEEPLFAARVIYD (residues 2510–2529 of bovine IP3R1), was shown to interact with purified CGB both at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2 A) and pH 7.5 (Fig. 2 B). Interaction of L3-2 with CGB is in accord with the interaction of the identical loop region of rat type II IP3R with CGA (24Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which showed interaction at the intravesicular pH of 5.5 but not at the near physiological pH of 7.5. Nevertheless, unlike the interaction that has been demonstrated between L3-2 and CGB (Fig. 2), the interaction study between the GST fusion proteins of the intraluminal loop regions of IP3R1 and CGA failed to show interaction between the L3-2 region and CGA (not shown). The inability of CGA to interact with GST-L3-2 fusion protein at pH 5.5 appears to reflect the significantly weaker affinity of CGA for the L3-2 region than that of CGB. The affinity of CGB for the secretory vesicle membrane has previously been demonstrated to be much greater than that of CGA that the vesicle-bound CGB was not released by a change of pH alone from 5.5 to 7.5 (12Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8680-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the condition that has been proved to be sufficient to release bound CGA from the secretory vesicle membrane (11Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8213-8219Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rather, the release of bound CGB required the combination of a pH change from 5.5 to 7.5 and high salt (1m KCl) (12Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8680-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Judging from these results, the interaction of CGB with L3-2 of IP3R1 even at pH 7.5 seemed to reflect the greater affinity of CGB for L3-2 at pH 7.5 than that of CGA at pH 5.5. This prediction has indeed been proved to be the case, since the ΔG 0 value of interaction between CGA and the L3-2 region of IP3R at pH 5.5 was −6 to −6.9 kcal/mol (24Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas the ΔG 0 value of the CGB-L3-2 interaction at pH 7.5 was −8.1 kcal/mol (TableI).Table IThermodynamic parameters for the interaction of the intraluminal loop peptide of the IP 3 R with CGB and with the conserved near N-terminal CGB peptide at 310.15 K (37 °C)CGB-IP3R peptideCGB peptide-IP3R peptideΔG 0 (kcal/mol−1)−8.10−4.70ΔH 0 (kcal/mol−1)0.76−0.41ΔCP 0(kcal/mol−1K−1)−0.56−0.09TΔS 0(kcal/mol−1)8.864.29The values were obtained at pH 7.5 in the absence of Ca2+, and the standard state was chosen to be 1 mol liter−1 of each reactant.

Chromogranin B at pH 7.5 in the absence of Ca2+ was found only as an ideal monomer, the concentration distribution of which could be appropriately described by the mathematical model, cr=cb,1exp(AM(r2−rb2))+ɛEquation 1 where cr is the concentration, expressed as absorbance at 280 nm, as a function of radial position;cb ,1 is the concentration of monomer at the cell bottom (rb); A = (1 −υ¯ρ)ω2/2 RT, where υ¯is the compositional partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the rotor angular velocity,R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature; M is the molar mass of CGB monomer, which has the value of 71,425 daltons (32Bauer J.W. Fischer-Colbrie R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); ε is a small base-line error correction term. Likewise, both the CGB peptide and the IP3R peptide alone at pH 7.5 in the absence of Ca2+ were also found to be ideal monomers, the concentration of which could be described by the same mathematical model using appropriate values of A and M for each of these peptides. The M value used for the IP3R was 2,549 daltons, and that for the CGB peptide was 2,279 daltons. In light of the previous observation that CGA interacts with the IP3R peptide and CGB interacts with the secretory vesicle membrane even at pH 7.5 (12Yoo S.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8680-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility of interaction between either intact CGB or the conserved near N-terminal CGB peptide and the intraluminal loop peptide of the IP3R at pH 7.5. Analysis of the concentration distribution data of mixtures of either CGB peptide (Fig. 3) or intact CGB (Fig. 5) with the IP3R peptide indicated that both CGB and the CGB peptide interacted with the IP3R peptide at pH 7.5. A 1:1 stoichiometry association appeared to be the only viable model of association. The mathematical model for this association is given by the equation, cr=cb,B,1exp(ABMB(r2−rb2))+cb,P,1exp(ApMP(r2−rb2))Equation 2 +cb,B,1cb,P,1exp(lnK(BP)−ln(EBEP/(EB+Ep))+(ABMB+ApMp)(r2−rb2))+ɛwhere ln K( BP ) is the logarithm of the molar equilibrium constant for the formation of the heterodimer, where EB is the molar extinction coefficient of either CGB or the CGB peptide, depending on the experiment. EP is the molar extinction coefficient of the IP3R peptide; the values of A and M are similarly denoted, and the other terms have their usual meaning as described above. The logarithmic term of the extinction coefficient is needed to convert the molar equilibrium constant to an equilibrium constant on an absorbancy scale, since this is the unit of concentration actually measured. This equation was used to generate three models for globally fitting the peptide-peptide interaction using scans at 280, 295, and 310 nm with appropriate values of EB and EP , obtaining ln K( BP ) as a global fitting parameter and the cB values and ε as local fitting parameters. Similarly, two models were used for global fitting of the CGB-IP3R peptide interaction at 280 and 300 nm.Figure 5Distribution of concentration of chromogranin B and the intraluminal loop peptide of IP3R at pH 7.5.Distribution of chromogranin B (0.1 mg/ml) and the intraluminal loop peptide of the IP3R (35Südhof T.C.

The line shows the best fitting curve for the CGB-IP3R intraluminal loop peptide interaction model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The analysis of the interaction of the CGB peptide and the IP3R peptide was quite straightforward (Fig. 3). Both the molar masses and the molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm were quite similar. Global analysis at three wavelengths enhanced the precision, since at 280 nm, both peptides contributed approximately equally to the observed absorbances; at 310 nm, the absorbance was due virtually entirely to the 5-OH tryptophan-labeled IP3R peptide, either free or complexed with the CGB peptide; at 295 nm, an intermediate absorbance was observed. This can be clearly seen in Fig.3. On the other hand, the analysis of the CGB protein with the IP3R peptide was considerably more complex (Figs.4 and 5). Because of the large difference of their respective molar masses and molar extinction coefficients, it was found necessary to load the cells with a significant molar excess of the IP3R peptide so that the initial absorbance of each species was approximately equal before centrifugal redistribution. The result of this was the creation of an abnormally shaped sum of squares surface in parameter space. Fig. 4illustrates the sum of squares of a global fit of absorbances at 280 and 300 nm as a function of ln K and demonstrates a sigmoid distribution instead of the usual approximately parabolic distribution. Accordingly, it was difficult to obtain a clear minimum in the sum of squares and impossible to obtain a meaningful parameter error estimate. Obtaining the best value for the minimum sum of squares was aided by invoking conservation of mass within the centrifuge cell. For any component in the centrifuge cell, conservation of mass of that component is defined by the equation, ∫rmrbcrdr2=∫rmrbc0dr2=c0(rb2−rm2)dr2=c0Δr2Equation 3 Integration of the first term and rearrangement then gives the following. c0=cb(1−exp(−AMΔr2))/AMΔr2Equation 4 This may now be applied to Equation 2, and the resulting equation can be used to calculate the apparent total initial absorbance at 280 n"
https://openalex.org/W2080182629,"For most substrates of ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation, recognition by the proteasome is mediated by a covalently attached signal assembled from multiple ubiquitins linked to each other via the C terminus of one Ub and the ε-amine of Lys48 of another Ub. Among Ub-conjugating enzymes, E2-25K is unique in its ability to synthesizein vitro unanchored Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains from mono- or poly-Ub, E1, and ATP; thus, E2-25K has distinct binding sites for donor and acceptor (poly)Ub. During studies of chain assembly by E2-25K, we observed that Lys48-linked tri-Ub was efficiently converted to a new species that upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migrated between linear di-Ub and tri-Ub. Analysis of this product by mass spectrometry and tryptic digestion showed that it was a cyclic form of tri-Ub. Cyclization of tri-Ub requires E1, E2-25K, ATP, and that the linear substrate has a free Gly76 C terminus on the proximal end Ub and a Lys48 side chain available on the distal end Ub. E2-25K similarly can catalyze the cyclization of longer poly-Ub chains, including tetra- and penta-Ub. Although cyclic tri-Ub resists hydrolysis by the PA700 or isopeptidase T deubiquitinating enzymes, it can be disassembled to Ub monomers by isopeptidase(s) in a red blood cell extract.

Usually, the C-terminal carboxyl group of Ub is linked to an internal lysine side chain of the substrate, and subsequently, multiple ubiquitins are added to form a poly-Ub chain extension. Its 8 primary amino groups (i.e. an unblocked N terminus plus 7 lysine residues) give Ub the potential to be assembled into a large variety of poly-Ub structures. Ub residues Lys6, Lys11, Lys29, Lys48, and Lys63 all can act as acceptors for ubiquitination, and poly-Ub with linkages through Lys29, Lys48, and Lys63 have been implicated in distinct physiological functions (reviewed in Refs. 3Pickart C.M.

Nonetheless, chains with Ub−Ub isopeptide bonds made exclusively through Ub Lys48 appear to be the principal 26 S proteasome recognition signal (5Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D.

Ubiquitination generally entails multiple rounds of Ub transfer catalyzed by the sequential action of the Ub activating enzyme (E1), a Ub conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub-protein ligase (E3). Among the large number of E2 enzymes (7Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), mammalian E2-25K and its 20-kDa wheat homolog are unique in their ability to assemble Lys48-linked poly-Ub in the absence of an E3 in vitro (8Chen Z.

E2-25K can utilize either mono-Ub or poly-Ub as the acceptor for ubiquitination, and in all cases the transfer is exclusively to Lys48 of the distal Ub unit. E2-25K is similarly flexible with respect to the donor substrate. Both Ub and poly-Ub can be activated by E1 to form a (poly)Ub−E1 thiol ester, and such adducts are competent as (poly)Ub donors for E2-25K-catalyzed chain elongation. However, whether E2-25K functions to assemble unanchored chains of Lys48-linked poly-Ub in vivo is unclear, and its kinetic properties make such a possibility unlikely (Ref. 8Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and see “Discussion”). Nonetheless, the unique ability of E2-25K in vitro to assemble chainsde novo from Ub, E1, and ATP makes possible the synthesis of large amounts of unanchored Lys48-linked poly-Ub (11van Nocker S.

During the preparation of Lys48-linked poly-Ub, poor yields of tri-Ub and longer poly-Ub chains prompted us to re-examine the progress of the E2-25K-catalyzed reaction. We observed that, as the concentrations of mono-Ub and di-Ub decreased, a new Ub-containing protein accumulated that appeared by SDS-PAGE to have a size between di-Ub and tri-Ub. Characterization of this protein showed that it was a cyclic molecule formed by an intramolecular Gly76−Lys48 isopeptide bond that connected the proximal and distal-end Ub units of a linear tri-Ub precursor. Similar intramolecular cyclization products were found for tetra-Ub and penta-Ub. Our results explain anomalous SDS-PAGE gel patterns seen previously with mixtures of poly-Ub chains (11van Nocker S.

Methods to detect the presence of cyclic poly-Ub are discussed, as are strategies to minimize or avoid cyclization in E2-25K-catalyzed reactions. Finally, although the cyclic chains resist most deubiquitinating enzymes, an activity in a red blood cell extract was found that can open cyclic Lys48-linked tri-Ub and disassemble it to form Ub monomers.

Xu (24Xu W. Modulation of a Deubiquitinating Enzyme by Incorporation into the PA700(19S) Proteasomal Regulatory Complex Ph. D. Thesis. The University of Iowa, 1999Google Scholar). Affinity purified bovine isopeptidase T was prepared as described (12Chen Z.J. Niles E.G. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15698-15704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A collection of E. coli strains containing variousSaccharomyces cerevisiae UBP genes expressed from either pGEX (UBP5, UBP14/IsoT, and UBP9) or yeast-based plasmids (UBP1, UBP2, UBP3, UPB4/DOA4, UBP7, andUBP13) was provided by M. Hochstrasser (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains were synthesized according to Chen and Pickart (8Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical chain synthesis reaction contained 0.1 μm E1, 10 μm E2-25K (either wild-type or the more stable C170S variant) or 4 μm GST−E2-25K, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.03 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.3 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and various concentrations of wild-type or mutant Ub; incubations were done at 37 °C. For cyclization reactions that employed presynthesized chains, the same reagents were used except that poly-Ub chains were added instead of mono-Ub. Incubations of poly-Ub with various deubiquitinating enzymes were done at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. The products from a chain synthesis reaction were first separated by cation-exchange HPLC (POROS HS/H column eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–1m NaCl in 25 mm NH4OAc, pH 4.5). Poly-Ub chains of defined length (n = 2–5) were individually collected and further purified by gel filtration (1 × 30 cm Superdex 75 column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl as the solvent. Separation of linear from cyclic poly-Ub was achieved by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 column eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 30–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Radioiodinations used carrier-free Na125I and lactoperoxidase and were done by the University of Iowa DERC Radioiodination Facility. A yeast cell lysate was prepared from S. cerevisiae strain LWY7236 (MATahis3pep4). Cells were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) with shaking at 30 °C, harvested in mid-logarithmic phase by centrifugation, and broken by vortexing the cell pellet for 3 min with equal volumes of glass beads (∼0.5 μm) and ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm sorbitol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). The supernatant fraction after centrifugation (5,200 × gfor 5 min) was used as the crude yeast lysate. Fraction II from a bovine red blood cell hemolysate (rbcFII) was prepared by anion-exchange chromatography essentially as described for rabbit reticulocyte Fraction II (26Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hemolysate (provided by P. Rogers, Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Iowa) was passed through a column of DEAE cellulose (Whatman DE52) equilibrated with 3 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The flow-through contained most of the hemoglobin and Ub. After extensive washing with the same buffer, the rbcFII fraction was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The eluate was collected, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and stored at −80 °C. SDS-PAGE was done according to standard protocols (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1991Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, 14% polyacrylamide gels were used and proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. To detect Ub-containing species by immunoblotting, samples were electrophoresed through a 10–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Tris-HCl/SDS buffer system; Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm pore-size). Immunodetection was done according to standard protocols with affinity purified rabbit anti-Ub antibody (produced as described in Ref. 28Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma), and the SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). Matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry employed a PerSeptive Voyager DE-STR instrument operated in linear mode at a 25 kV accelerating voltage and with an ion-extraction delay of 300 ns. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used for the sample matrix, and thioredoxin (MH+ = 11674.4) and horse heart myoglobin (MH+ = 16952.5) were used as internal standards for mass calibration. The model was built from the crystal structures of Ub and Lys48-linked di-Ub (Protein Data Bank accession numbers 1UBQ and 1AAR, respectively) using SYBYL (Tripos, Inc.). The cyclic trimer was constructed by rotation of the isopeptide bond in the di-Ub structure and incorporation of the Ub monomer by the addition of two new Gly76−Lys48 isopeptide bonds. The structure then was energy-minimized using SYBYL by allowing rotations about all Gly75−Gly76−Lys48 (iso)peptide bonds and Lys48 side chain bonds. The progress of a typical chain synthesis reaction catalyzed by E2-25K and with wild-type Ub as the initial substrate was monitored by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). As expected, with increasing time, high molecular mass poly-Ub chains accumulated and the amount of Ub monomer decreased. Surprisingly, however, after about 1 h when the free Ub monomer was nearly exhausted, a new species that migrated between di-Ub and tri-Ub was observed. Because the amount of this new species, “Ubx,” appeared to increase as the linear tri-Ub decreased, we suspected that Ubx was a derivative or isoform of tri-Ub. To purify Ubx for further characterization, we used three sequential chromatographic steps to isolate it from the poly-Ub product mixture. Poly-Ub chains of different lengths were first separated by cation-exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration. The tri-Ub pool then was further subjected to reverse phase HPLC. Although Ubx was not resolved from linear tri-Ub by either cation-exchange or gel filtration chromatography (data not shown), good separation was achieved with a C4 reverse phase HPLC column (Fig.2 A). The individual peaks were collected and identified as linear tri-Ub and Ubx by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 B). We observed that the increase of the new species during the chain synthesis reaction was coupled to a decrease of tri-Ub, which suggested a direct precursor-product relationship. When this idea was tested with purified tri-Ub (Fig. 3), we found that tri-Ub was converted to the new species, and that the conversion depended on E1, E2-25K, and ATP. Based on the known specificities of E1 and E2-25K (8Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the simplest explanation was that E2-25K had catalyzed formation of an intramolecular isopeptide bond in tri-Ub that joined the C terminus of the proximal Ub to the Lys48ε-amine of the distal Ub. That is, Ubx could be a cyclic form of tri-Ub containing three Gly76−Lys48 isopeptide bonds. This hypothesis was supported by matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry. For both linear tri-Ub and Ubx, six independent mass profiles were collected from which we calculated the mean and the standard deviation of their masses. Ubx was found to have a molecular mass 18.2 ± 2.1 Da less than that of linear tri-Ub (Table I). This mass difference was consistent with the loss of one water molecule that would result from intramolecular (iso)peptide bond formation.Figure 1Poly-Ub chain synthesis. A reaction mixture containing 10 mg/ml Ub, 100 nm E1, 10 μm E2-25K, and an ATP regeneration system (see “Experimental Procedures”) was incubated at 37 °C. At 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 h (lanes 2–7, respectively), aliquots were added to SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (14% polyacrylamide gel). Lane 1 contains the molecular weight markers. Coomassie Blue staining revealed that, after a 1-h incubation (lane 4), a new product (Ubx) appeared at a position between di-Ub and tri-Ub.

The mean and standard deviations of the measured molecular masses are based on the (M+2H)2+ ions observed in six independent mass profiles. As a folded protein, mono-Ub is cut readily by trypsin only at Arg74 (30Wilkinson K.D. Audhya T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9235-9241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If Ubx was indeed a cyclic form of tri-Ub, then a single cleavage by trypsin should open the ring. The product would differ from authentic linear tri-Ub in that Ub74 and Gly75−Gly76 fragments from the cut Ub would flank di-Ub at, respectively, the proximal and distal ends of the chain. Nevertheless, we expected that a cyclic tri-Ub linearized in this manner would behave like authentic linear tri-Ub with respect to its mobility upon SDS-PAGE. Fig. 4 shows that a 5-min treatment of Ubx with 0.5 μm trypsin yielded a product that migrated slower than the starting material and coincident with linear tri-Ub. By 15 min, the amount of linear trimer decreased because it was further digested by trypsin, as revealed by the appearance of a new species that migrated at the positions of mono-Ub and di-Ub. In fact, experiments that used a wide range of trypsin concentrations indicated that linear tri-Ub is about 10 times more susceptible than the cyclic form to cleavage by trypsin (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, we found that the linearized trimer was a relatively short-lived intermediate in the trypsin digestion reactions and never accounted for more than 10% of the total protein. To test if the new linkage in Ubx was an isopeptide bond between Gly76of the proximal Ub and Lys48 of the distal Ub, we synthesized two modified forms of tri-Ub, Ub−Ub−Ub(Asp77), and Ub(Arg48)−Ub−Ub. The first tri-Ub derivative is blocked from activation by E1 by the incorporation of a C-terminal extended Ub (13Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas the second chain is blocked from acting as an acceptor for elongation by E2-25K by having Ub(K48R) at the distal end (10Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As expected, neither of these modified tri-Ub chains could be converted by E2-25K into the faster-migrating Ubx species (Fig.5 A). This result is consistent with the finding that poly-Ub chains synthesized by E2-25K are linked exclusively through Gly76−Lys48 isopeptide bonds (8Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For additional evidence to identify the new linkage in Ubx, we took advantage of a chemically modified mutant form of Ub, Me/AE-Ub(Cys48); in this Ub derivative, the only primary amine is on the side chain of S-aminoethylcysteine, a lysine-like residue introduced specifically at position 48 (5). When Me/AE-Ub(Cys48) replaced Ub in a chain synthesis reaction, a fast-migrating species similar to Ubx was observed among the products (Fig. 5 B). Together with previous results, these observations strongly support the conclusion that E2-25K can introduce a third isopeptide bond into tri-Ub by joining Gly76 at the proximal end to Lys48 at the distal end. Thus, Ubx is the product of an intramolecular cyclization. Ub modified by iodination of Tyr59 is a very poor acceptor in E2-25K-catalyzed chain synthesis reactions (25Pickart C.M. Haldeman M.T. Kasperek E.M. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14418-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although monoiodotyrosyl-Ub is activated by E1 and can be transferred to form a thiol ester at the “donor” substrate-binding site of E2-25K, iodination of Tyr59blocks utilization of (poly)Ub at the acceptor site of an E2-25K-Ub thiol ester complex. Thus, E2-25K will add monoiodotyrosyl-Ub to the distal end, but not the proximal end, of a poly-Ub chain. We reasoned that if monoiodotyrosyl-Ub is not a competent acceptor in linear chain synthesis, then it also will not be an acceptor in intramolecular cyclization. We incubated monoiodotyrosyl-Ub and Lys48-linked di-Ub with E2-25K in a typical chain synthesis reaction (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this way, every poly-Ub product with an odd number of ubiquitins would contain an iodotyrosyl-Ub at its distal end. The result, that monoiodotyrosyl-Ub was incorporated into linear tri-Ub but that no Ubx was produced (Fig.5 C, lane 2), suggests that chain cyclization by E2-25K employs the same substrate acceptor site as is used in chain elongation. Cyclization of tri-Ub might suggest that tri-Ub has a structure that uniquely allows both ends (i.e. the distal Ub and the thiol ester-bound proximal Ub) to fit into the active site of E2-25K. However, it is also possible that longer poly-Ub chains are sufficiently flexible to allow productive binding for cyclization. In order to test this, we purified linear Lys48-linked tetra-Ub and penta-Ub as potential substrates for cyclization. These chains then were incubated with E1 and E2-25K in the presence of ATP. In the case of tetra-Ub, after incubation neither higher-order chains (e.g. corresponding to the octamer) nor a shift to faster mobility was observed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). However, a peak shift was evident by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 6 A). We isolated the new product that corresponded to this shifted peak and found that, unlike linear tetra-Ub, it was no longer susceptible to disassembly by isopeptidase T (Fig. 6 B), a deubiquitinating enzyme that requires a free proximal Ub for activity (31, and see below). The simplest explanation is that the tetra-Ub was cyclized by E2-25K, although unlike the case with the trimer, the cyclic tetramer was not resolved by SDS-PAGE. Curiously, cyclization by E2-25K of an even longer substrate, linear penta-Ub, again gave rise to a slightly faster-migrating protein band as seen by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6 C). We conclude that cyclization by E2-25K is not restricted to tri-Ub, but that longer chains also are subject to this reaction. In vitro, poly-Ub synthesis by E2-25K is rather inefficient. For transfer of donor Ub to acceptor (poly)Ub, the enzyme exhibits ak cat/K m of only ∼1 × 103m−1 min−1 and a high K m (∼600 μm) for the acceptor substrate (10Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Relative to this intermolecular ubiquitination reaction, the intramolecular cyclization of poly-Ub is surprisingly efficient. Using conditions in which E1 was saturating, we found that linear tri-Ub is converted to cyclic tri-Ub at the rate of ∼0.1 min−1. Even with less than 4 μm linear tri-Ub, a concentration that is 150-fold lower than theK m for Ub acceptor, the conversion to cyclic tri-Ub proceeded at nearly 20% of the maximum rate reported for di-Ub formation (10Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A likely explanation for the relatively high efficiency of the E2-25K-catalyzed cyclization is that binding of the poly-Ub proximal end to the E2 donor site dramatically increases the effective concentration of the acceptor susbstrate, i.e. the distal Ub of the chain. Therefore, we predicted that competition by substrates at the E2-25K donor site could effectively inhibit poly-Ub cyclization, but that the reaction would be much less sensitive to competition at the acceptor site. The results in Fig.7 A support this idea. When Ub(Cys48) was included as a competing donor substrate, cyclization of linear tri-Ub was inhibited almost complete"

The molecular communication networks vary widely, involving one or more of the following: protein-protein complex formation, post-translational protein modification, and subcellular localization/exclusion of regulatory proteins (1Thevelein J.M. De Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae allantoin pathway genes (DAL1-5 and DUR1-3) encode the permeases and enzymes required to degrade allantoin or its metabolic products to ammonia and carbon dioxide (2Cooper T.G. Marzluf G. Bambrl R. Mycota III. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 139-169Google Scholar). Expression of these genes is subject to several major types of control. First and foremost is nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)1in which the GATA family transcription activators Gln3p and Gat1p are excluded from the nucleus and hence cannot reach their GATA-binding sites (3ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A.

In contrast to NCR, which is a global control mechanism shared by other nitrogen catabolic gene systems, induced DAL andDUR gene expression represents a second type of control (2Cooper T.G. Marzluf G. Bambrl R. Mycota III. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 139-169Google Scholar). It is allantoin pathway-specific with the inducer being the last intermediate in the pathway, allophanate, or its non-metabolized analogue oxalurate (OXLU) (2Cooper T.G. Marzluf G. Bambrl R. Mycota III. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 139-169Google Scholar). The broad outlines of DAL gene induction have most recently been derived from analyses of the DAL7 promoter and transcription associated with it (12Yoo H.S. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3777-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas the function of Dal81p is unknown. Although only 29 kDa, Dal82p possesses at least three demonstrable domains as follows: a UISALL-DNA binding domain (a.a. 1–85), a transcriptional activation domain (a.a. 66–99); and a putative (based on predicted sequence and secondary structure homology) C-terminal coiled-coil domain, designated coiled-coilDAL82 (a.a. 217–255) (16Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Deletions within these domains result in loss of only one function. However, deletions within the overlapping region of the UISALL binding and transcriptional activation domains (a.a. 66–85) eliminate both functions. A LexA-Dal82p fusion protein devoid of the coiled-coilDAL82 supports 5-fold greater induced reporter gene expression than full-length wild type (16Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The objective of this work is to further understand the roles played by the three Dal82p domains in the induction process. Plasmids, containing deletions of Dal82p binding and activation regions, were derived from pRD41 (15Dorrington R.A. Cooper T.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3777-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,16Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), using the single-stranded template method (pSelectTMmutagenesis kit, Promega Corp.). For each deletion, annealed complementary strand oligonucleotides, respectively, covering 25 bp 5′ and 25 bp 3′ of the desired deletion and maintaining the native reading frame were prepared. All constructs were sequenced to verify that no changes were made other than the designated deletion and to confirm maintenance of the correct reading frame. Two types of LexAp-Dal82p plasmids were used as follows: 1) a “bait” plasmid for two-hybrid studies was a pEG202 derivative (contains HIS3 marker), and 2) LexAp fusion plasmids for activation studies were BTM116 derivatives (a close derivative of pEG202 containing a TRP1 marker) (both vectors were from Roger Brent's laboratory (17Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausabel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 1.1-1.28Google Scholar)). The LexAp DNA binding domain in both plasmids was under control of the yeast ADH1 promoter. The pEG202 derivative, containing DAL82, was constructed using an EcoRI-BamHI adapter (5′-GATCCACCGATTCATCCATG-3′ and 5′-AATTCATGGATGAATCGGTG-3′) cloned into pEG202 digested with EcoRI and BamHI. This insert fragment generated the correct reading frame for fusing the LexAp DNA-binding domain to the first 8 Dal82p a.a. The remainder ofDAL82 (BamHI-BglII fragment from pM08 (18Olive M.J. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 255-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the BamHI site yielding pSS8202. All of the above plasmids contain 2 μ sequences. The pBTM116-based vector was constructed by cloning the 500-bpEcoRI-EcoRI fragment from pSS8202 intoEcoRI-digested pBTM116. The remainder of DAL82 (aSalI-PstI fragment from pSS20) was then cloned into the SalI-PstI sites. pSS20 was constructed by subcloning the 3.9-kilobase pairEagI-ClaI fragment from pMO8 (18Olive M.J. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 255-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into YCp50 yielding pSS82BTM. Various deletion derivatives of pSS82BTM were constructed by replacing wild type sequences between theBamHI and XhoI sites with sequences containing the desired deletion from the pRDΔ and pSSΔ plasmids (16Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To construct “prey” pVS8115, full-length DAL81 was cloned, in-frame with B42, into the XhoI site of pJG4-5 using SalI-BsmFI andPstI-SalI polymerase chain reaction adaptors. Full-length DAL81, including its promoter, from pPB14 (19Bricmont P.A. Daugherty J.R. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and pVS8115, was cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of 2-μm pRS423 to yield pSS42381. pSS42381 was used to test the effect of Dal81p overproduction in the two-hybrid assay (20Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Heiter P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Construction of LexA-Gln3 pVS3BTM and pVS32 have been described (21Svetlov V. Transcriptional Activator and Yeast Nitrogen Metabolism. Ph.D. thesis. University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN1997Google Scholar). Transformants, generally appearing 2–3 days after incubation (30 °C), were patched onto plates containing selective medium, incubated 2 days at 30 °C, and then inoculated into 50 ml of liquid YNB media (0.17% YNB without casamino acids or ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and 0.1% nitrogen source). Where indicated, inducer (OXLU) was added to a final concentration of 66 mg/liter. These cultures were grown overnight to a density ofA 600 = 0.45–1.00 and assayed as described earlier (22Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Units of activity were calculated as Miller (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) (units = 1000 × A 420/time (min) × volume (ml) × A 600) except that 10 ml instead of 1 ml of culture were used. Each transformant was assayed in duplicate, and the reported β-galactosidase activities are the average of at least two separate, randomly selected transformants from the same transformation event and in many cases from two independent transformation events. Dal82p supports transcriptional activation when tethered to a UAS-less promoter via LexAp (16Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To establish the requirements for this activity, we assayed it in wild type (M1682-19b) anddal81Δ (PB200) strains growing in glucose/proline medium. LexA-Dal82p-mediated transcription requires both Dal81p and inducer, oxalurate (OXLU) (Fig. 1,pSS82BTM). It is important to note that OXLU uptake does not depend upon a permease whose production is Dal81p-dependent. 2J. McKelvey and T. G. Cooper, unpublished observations. Therefore, the Dal81p dependence of lacZ expression doesn't derive indirectly from a Dal81p requirement for OXLU transport. A small deletion in the Dal82p activation domain (residues 89 to 95) destroys LexA-Dal82p-mediated transcription, demonstrating its absolute requirement for the activity we measured (Fig. 1, pSS480). pSS480 contains the same dal82 deletion as pRD480 which was demonstrated by Western analysis to produce a stable truncated protein. Furthermore, Dal82p produced from pSS480, although transcriptionally inactive, is able to bind DNA fragments containing UISALL(16Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since protein-protein interactions can occur through coiled-coil motifs such as the one in Dal82p, we reasoned that inducer-dependent transcription might derive from Dal81p being recruited to the reporter gene promoter via Dal82p,i.e. Dal82p acts as a bridge between DNA and Dal81p. To test this idea, we removed the putative C-terminal coiled-coilDAL82 (a.a. 217–255) (16Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This mutation drastically altered the transcription profile (Fig.2, pSS43). (i) InducedlacZ expression increased 5-fold with respect to wild type (pSS82BTM) and became largely, but not completely, inducer-independent (Fig. 1, WT, pSS43). (ii) High level expression, similar to that seen in the uninduced wild type, occurred in adal81Δ, but addition of OXLU no longer increased expression (Fig. 1, pSS43). Again, an additional small activation domain deletion destroyed lacZ expression, demonstrating its epistasis to the coiled-coilDAL82deletion (plasmid pSS890).Figure 2Requirement of Dal81p for LexA-coiled-coilDAL82-mediated transcriptional activation. The strains and conditions were as described in Fig.1. pSSCCBTM, used in this experiment, contains the LexA DNA-binding domain fused to coiled-coilDAL82 a.a. 210–255.WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These experiments revealed several additional characteristics of Dal82p-dependent transcriptional activation. (i) The coiled-coilDAL82 domain mediates strong negative regulation of Dal82p-dependent activation when inducer is absent and continues this role, albeit to a lesser extent, when inducer is present. (ii) Relief of this down-regulation requires inducer and Dal81p whether or not the coiled-coilDAL82 domain is present. (iii) Dal82p-mediated transcription remains 2-fold inducer-responsive even when the coiled-coilDAL82 domain is absent; this response is Dal81p-dependent. (iv) Dal81p is not required for high level transcription if Dal82p lacks its coiled-coilDAL82 domain. Since the Dal82p transcriptional activation and UISALL-binding domains partially overlap, we next investigated whether alteration of the UISALL-binding domain influenced the LexA-Dal82p-mediated transcriptional activation profile. Note that for this experiment we chose a UISALL-binding domain deletion that did not demonstrably affect transcriptional activation (16Scott S. Dorrington R. Svetlov V. Beeser A.E. Distler M. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7198-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Deleting the Dal82p UISALL-binding domain (amino acids 8–16) did not affect basal level expression but dramatically increased induced transcription to the same high level observed with the coiled-coilDAL82deletion (Fig. 1, pSS489). Induced transcription, like that supported by wild type pSS82BTM, was completely Dal81p-dependent. In other words, deleting the coiled-coilDAL82 or a portion of the UISALL-binding domain yields the same phenotype in the presence of inducer. As with the coiled-coilDAL82 deletion, a Dal82p activation domain deletion was epistatic to one in the Dal82p UISALL-binding domain (Fig. 1, pSS889). When deletions were introduced into both the Dal82p coiled-coilDAL82 and UISALL-binding domains, several changes occurred in the activation profile. (i) Reporter gene expression became fully Dal81p- and partially inducer-independent; wild type and dal81Δ strains behaved identically (Fig. 1,pSS820). The induced level with the double mutant, although 2–3 times that seen with the induced wild type LexA-Dal82p (pSS82BTM), was only half the induced level supported by pSS489 and pSS43, or about the same as with pSS43 in a dal81Δ (Fig. 2). (ii) pSS820 retained a clear inducer response, arguing that inducer played a role beyond Dal81p and the coiled-coilDAL82 domain. (iii) Maximum induced Dal82-mediated activation could be achieved by deleting either the coiled-coilDAL82 or UISALL-binding domains, but not both. The important regulatory role demonstrated above for the coiled-coilDAL82 domain prompted us to determine whether it could function on its own; LexA was fused ahead of sequences encoding the coiled-coilDAL82 (a.a. 210–255, pSSCCBTM, Fig. 2). Remarkably, LexA-coiled-coilDAL82p supports OXLU-induced transcription, although more weakly (6–7-fold) than with full-length LexA-Dal82p (Fig. 2). Transcription is both inducer- and Dal81p-dependent, arguing that the coiled-coilDAL82p is structurally sufficient to mediate basic inducer responsiveness and Dal81p participation in it. On the other hand, inducer and Dal81p function through more than one domain of Dal82p. We base this conclusion on the observation that LexA-Dal82p lacking the coiled-coilDAL82 (pSS43) retains some Dal81p-dependent inducer responsiveness (Fig. 1). During characterization of cis-acting mutations in the Gln3p-binding sites of DAL7, we observed that single base substitutions in these GATA sequences destroyed their ability to support heterologous reporter gene expression (24Van Vuuren H.J.J. Daugherty J.R. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7186-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This phenotype could be effectively suppressed if we cloned a UISALL(Dal82p-binding site) adjacent to the mutated GATA sequence. Suppression required both Dal82p and its ability to bind to the UISALL element but did not require inducer or Dal81p (24Van Vuuren H.J.J. Daugherty J.R. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7186-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations pointed to a functional relationship between Gln3p and Dal82p. Therefore, we investigated whether LexAp-Dal82p-mediated transcription was affected by mutations in GLN3. Basal level (uninduced) reporter gene expression supported by full-length LexA-Dal82p and LexA-Dal82p lacking the UISALL-binding domain was largely Gln3p-dependent (Fig.3 A, pSS82BTM andpSS489). Only uninduced levels of β-galactosidase production were assayed because Gln3p is required for OXLU uptake. Although there was demonstrable Gln3p dependence of transcriptional activation supported by a coiled-coilDAL82 deletion, the requirement was modest (∼2-fold) (Fig. 3 B,pSS43). β-Galactosidase production supported by the coiled-coilDAL82, UISALL-binding domain double mutant (pSS820) was 25% lower than seen with the single coiled-coilDAL82 deletion (pSS43) in gln3Δstrain RR911 and was Gln3p-independent (Fig. 3 B, pSS43open bar and pSS820 open and filled bars). pSS820 supported greater lacZ expression than either pSS82BTM or pSS489 in a gln3Δ. Note that both Dal81p and Gln3p dependence are lost together in the coiled-coilDAL82, UISALL-binding domain double deletion pSS820, although transcription supported by pSS820 in a Gln3+ strain is still inducer-responsive. In most cases, Gln3p dependence of the expression of a gene strongly correlates with it being NCR-sensitive (3ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A. Verrips C.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), thereby providing an independent indication of Gln3p participation in the expression of a gene. In wild type strain TCY5, β-galactosidase production supported by pSS43 was 2-fold NCR-sensitive; a similar sized effect was observed relative to wild type in proline medium with a gln3Δ (Fig.3 C). Little if any NCR sensitivity occurred when the experiment was performed in gln3Δ (strain RR911) (Fig.4 C). That NCR sensitivity parallels Gln3p dependence of transcription supported by LexA-Dal82p lacking the coiled-coilDAL82 argues in favor of the Gln3p dependence. A possible, trivial explanation for the Gln3p dependence of Dal82p-mediated activation might derive from the existence of Gln3p-binding sites near the LexAp-binding sites. If such sites exist, it is conceivable that we are reconstituting a more or less ordinary allantoin pathway gene promoter with binding of the Dal82p to the promoter occurring through LexAp-binding sites rather than aUISALL element. A computer search revealed two vector GATAA sequences 5 and 50 bp from the LexAp-binding sites. To determine whether these gratuitous sites accounted for the observed Gln3p dependence, we mutated them. β-Galactosidase production with wild type pSH18-34 was the same as with pSS618-34 in which the GATA sequences were mutated, arguing against the possibility of such an artifact (Fig. 4). One way Dal81p dependence of LexA-Dal82p-mediated transcription might occur is via formation of a Dal81p-Dal82p complex; data obtained with pSSCCBTM (Fig. 2), containing the coiled-coilDAL82 domain, are consistent with such a hypothesis. Because we were reluctant to tamper with the Dal82p activation domain, we used LexA-DAL82 pSS8202 as bait (Fig. 5). Without inducer, there was little transcription with negative control B42 activation domain pJG4-5 whether glucose or galactose was used as carbon source (Fig. 5 B, prey, pJG4-5 is galactose-inducible). In proline + OXLU medium, irrespective of the carbon source provided, β-galactosidase production is high because of the ability of LexA-Dal82p (the bait) to support inducer-dependent activation. A similar result was observed when Dal81-B42 pVS8115 was used as prey (Fig. 5 C). If overproducing full-length Dal81p influenced the transcriptional activation assay, we would have detected it here; there was no effect, and the profile was the same as with the B42 vector alone (Fig. 5 D). It is also important to note the lack of β-galactosidase production with ammonia or glutamine as nitrogen source in the control experiments (Fig. 5, A–C). In contrast, when Dal81-B42 pVS8115 was the prey and galactose was the carbon source, high level β-galactosidase production occurred in minimal glutamine, ammonia, or proline medium, all devoid of inducer (Fig. 5 D). Addition of inducer had no demonstrable effect upon the assay results except in glucose/proline medium where it was expected. In other words, the DAL81 prey yielded positive results in the absence of inducer only when the B42 activation domain was fused to it (Fig. 5, compare C and D). Although we would have preferred using a bait plasmid that was transcriptionally inactive whether or not inducer was present, the most straightforward interpretation of the data obtained in inducer-free medium is that the transcription we observed derived from the B42p activation domain of the Dal81p-B42 prey plasmid. The result argues in favor of a protein-protein interaction between Dal81p and Dal82p. High level reporter gene expression with repressive nitrogen sources supports this interpretation. If the activity derived solely from Dal82p-mediated activation, it would be NCR-sensitive (see Fig. 5). Another observation supports the contention of a functional relationship between Dal81p and Dal82p. Overproduction of Dal81p or Gln3p, but not Dal82p, is toxic, resulting in slow growth (25Minehart P.L. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6216-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). 3S. Scott and T. G. Cooper, unpublished observations. Simultaneous overproduction of Dal82p along with either Dal81p or Gln3p, however, suppresses this toxicity (data not shown). The partial requirement of Gln3p for Dal82p-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 3) and the growth phenotype suppression data just discussed raise the possibility that Gln3p might complex to Dal82p and thereby account for its activation capability. If such an interaction occurred, the SAGA components required for Dal82p- and Gln3p-mediated transcription would probably be similar since transcriptional activation would be achieved by Gln3p in both cases (26Roberts S.M. Winston F. Genetics. 1997; 147: 451-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Winston F. Sudarsanam P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To evaluate this possibility, we compared the SAGA requirement profiles of transcription mediated by LexA-Dal82p lacking the coiled-coilDAL82 and LexA-Gln3p (Fig.6). Coiled-coilDAL82 minus Dal82p was used for this experiment in preference to the inducer-dependent full-length protein, because Gln3p is required for uptake of inducer thereby compromising results obtained in the presence of inducer. The SAGA requirements of LexA-Gln3p and LexA-Dal82p differ for Spt3p, Spt8p, Spt20p, and Snf2p and maybe Spt7p and Gcn5p. LexAp-Dal82p-mediated activation possesses a greater requirement for Spt3p and smaller requirements for Spt8p, Snf2p, and perhaps Spt7p than that mediated by LexAp-Gln3p. Both proteins possess strong requirements for Spt20p/Ada5p. The above data provide further insight into the mechanism of allophanate-induced gene expression. Fig.7 depicts a very preliminary working hypothesis whose function is to provide a way of organizing and visualizing the large number of observations and correlations we have made; it is not meant to propose/summarize a definitive explanation of the induction process. Multiple domains of Dal82p, the UISALL-binding protein, play significant roles in this process. The Dal82p C-terminal coiled-coilDAL82 domain appears to be central to down-regulating Dal82p-mediated transcription in the absence of inducer. Moreover, coiled-coilDAL82 is one of the domains through which Dal81p participates in the induction process as evidenced by the following observations: (i) a LexA-coiled-coilDAL82 fusion protein alone can mediate inducer- and Dal81p-dependent transcriptional activation, and (ii) transcription mediated by dal82 constructs lacking coiled-coilDAL82 is largely Dal81p-independent. Dal81p appears necessary to neutralize negative control of OXLU-induced transcription that occurs through coiled-coilDAL82. Similar results would be expected, however, if Dal81p was potentiating the elimination of negative control that occurs through another mechanism. Data in Fig. 5 lead us to conclude that a complex forms between Dal81p and Dal82p, possibly through the coiled-coilDAL82 domain. However, we were unable to demonstrate direct participation of coiled-coilDAL82 in complex formation experimentally because (i) a LexA-coiled-coilDAL82p bait does not appear to function in the two-hybrid assay with Dal81p as prey, and (ii) a coiled-coilDAL82 minus DAL82 construct (pSS43) cannot be used as a bait because of the high level transcription it supports on its own. The alternative approach to this question is to employ Dal81p as the bait. Unfortunately, characterization of the very large Dal81p and its potential domains are not available because so far the cloning experiments have, for unknown reasons, not been possible. Although the coiled-coilDAL82 is a major domain associated with inducer and Dal81p function, it is not unique in this regard. Inducer responsiveness of the coiled-coilDAL82, UISALL-binding domain single deletion mutants (pSS43 and pSS489) and the double deletion mutant (pSS820) argues that the inducer signal, and the participation of Dal81p in responding to it, must occur through a second part of Dal82p as well. In addition, the induction characteristics of a coiled-coilDAL82 deletion alone and in combination with a binding site deletion as well as those of the LexA-coiled-coilDAL82p argues against the inducer simply binding to either Dal81p or Dal82p and seems to implicate an as yet unknown protein that is responsible for sensing the presence of the inducer. This reasoning is based on the following facts: (i) transcription mediated by the LexA-coiled-coilDAL82p (pSSCCBTM, Fig. 2) responds to inducer even though there is little more than the coiled-coilDAL82 present in the construct, (ii) LexA-Dal82p lacking the coiled-coilDAL82(pSS43) remains inducer-responsive, and (iii) the dal82UISALL DNA binding, coiled-coilDAL82 double deletion (pSS820) supports inducer-responsive reporter gene expression that also occurs in a dal81Δ recipient.

Open table in a new tab Another novel characteristic of the Dal81-Dal82 interaction is the negative regulation of the ability of Dal82p to mediate transcription in the absence of inducer. Here, although there is some loss of this negative regulation in a DNA-binding site deletion mutant, this domain does not seem to play as important a role as the coiled-coilDAL82. The centrality of the coiled-coilDAL82 in this function is further supported by the fact that one observes negative regulation of the ability of the isolated coiled-coilDAL82 to mediate reporter gene transcription in the absence of inducer. Dal82p has previously been characterized as a strictly positive regulatory protein. However, from this vantage point its coiled-coilDAL82 can also be considered a negative regulator of Dal82p-mediated transcription in the absence of inducer and that a potential function of Dal81p is to participate in the removal of this negative regulation or potentiation of its removal. There is another participant in the removal of negative regulation when inducer is present because limited induction remains indal81 mutants (Fig. 1, pSS820). A possible explanation for these results is that the coiled-coilDAL82, or some other part of the protein which is influenced by the coiled-coilDAL82, can mask the Dal82p transcriptional activation domain. By this reasoning, Dal81p, in the presence of inducer, interacts with the coiled-coilDAL82, and this complex unmasks the activation domain. The binding site deletion argues that a second portion of Dal82p participates in masking/unmasking the activation domain as well. Separate from the Dal81p, Gln3p also participates in Dal82p-mediated transcription. Two lines of evidence support this proposal. (i) UISALL/Dal82p suppression of Gln3p-binding site mutation (mutations in the GATA sequence) phenotypes occurs in the absence of Dal81p and inducer (24Van Vuuren H.J.J. Daugherty J.R. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7186-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). (ii) Dal82p participates in transcription mediated by CAR2 promoter fragments in the absence of inducer and Dal81p (28Park H.D. Scott S. Rai R. Dorrington R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7052-7064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there are no Gln3p-binding sites inCAR2, a functional UAS (RAP1-binding site) is required for UISALL to mediate transcription (28Park H.D. Scott S. Rai R. Dorrington R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7052-7064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility is that Dal81p forms a bridge between Dal82p and Gln3p which in turn interacts with the core transcription apparatus. This is less likely since (i) different subsets of SAGA components are required for LexA-Dal82p and LexA-Gln3p-mediated transcriptional activation, and (ii) Dal82p possesses a transcriptional activation domain and is able to support transcriptional activation in the absence of Gln3p or Dal81p. Objectively, however, we must also concede the existence of an alternative explanation for the SAGA results. It is possible that the Dal82p-Gln3p complex formation alters the conformation of Gln3p, and it is this alteration that is reflected in the Dal82p-specific SAGA component requirements. We have not distinguished between the two possibilities. These arguments lead to our current hypothesis that the functional interaction that appears to exist between Gln3p and Dal82p is not a direct Gln3p-Dal82p protein-protein complex but involves components of the core transcription complex. The bridge could be the SAGA complex itself with Gln3p and Dal82p contacting it at different points. By this view, one would expect the existing indications of a Gln3p-Dal82p interaction (24Van Vuuren H.J.J. Daugherty J.R. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7186-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) but without a demonstrable direct interaction. Although some components of the allophanate-mediated induction of transcription quite likely remain to be found (the hypothetical inducer binding protein), and the detailed protein-protein interactions are only now coming into focus, progress is being made toward filling in the missing pieces of the mechanism. This information will no doubt be prerequisite to understanding how UISALL-Dal82p-Dal81p and inducer are able to tip the equilibrium of Dal80p competing with Gln3p for binding to the GATA sequences upstream of the allantoin pathway genes in favor of Gln3p.

https://openalex.org/W2008871545,"Reactivity of surface lysyl residues of proteins with a broad range of chemical agents has been proposed to be dependent on the catalytic microenvironment of the residue. We have investigated the acetylation of wild type ubiquitin and of the UbH68N mutant to evaluate the potential contribution of His-68 to the reactivity of Lys-6, which is about 4 Å distant. These studies were performed using [1-13C]acetyl salicylate or [1,1′-13C2]acetic anhydride, and the acetylated products were detected by two-dimensional heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that His-68 makes a positive contribution to the rate of acetylation of Lys-6 by labeled aspirin. Additionally, a pair of transient resonances is observed after treatment of wild type ubiquitin with the labeled acetic anhydride but not upon treatment of the H68N mutant. These resonances are assigned to the acetylated His-68 residue. The loss of intensity of the acetylhistidine resonances is accompanied by an increase in intensity of the acetyl-Lys-6 peak, supporting the existence of a transacetylation process between the acetylhistidine 68 and lysine 6 residues located on the protein surface. Hence, this may be the first direct demonstration of a catalytic intermediate forming on the protein surface.

Hence, developing a mechanistic basis of such adduct formation is central to both an understanding of the structural basis for such toxicity and the development of alternate agents that may retain useful properties while exhibiting reduced tendencies to form undesirable adducts. For perhaps a majority of the examples of stable, covalent adducts that have been reported to form with proteins, linkages to lysine side chains are observed, despite the fact that at physiological pH values the lysyl ε-amino group is fully charged and hence a poor nucleophile. Several lines of evidence suggest that a catalytic microenvironment exists that overcomes the poor reactivity of the lysyl-NH3+ group. Thus, Nigen et al. (1Nigen A.M. Keim P. Marshall R.C. Morrow J.S. Vigna R.A. Gurd F.R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3724-3732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that, whereas at neutral pH bromoacetate will modify some of the lysyl residues in myoglobin, no lysyl adducts were formed after incubation of the peptide Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly with labeled bromoacetate at pH 7.6. In this case, adducts were observed with the N-terminal glycyl amino group. Analogous observations regarding the formation of thionoacyl adducts of albumin with metabolically generated thionoacyl fluoride intermediates led to a similar conclusion and to a proposed catalytic effect of histidine or tyrosine side chains, which was studied by the addition of imidazole and phenol to the system (2Hayden P.J. Yang Y. Ward A.J.I. Dulik D.M. McCann D.J. Stevens J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The most extensive investigations of non-enzymatic protein modification have involved protein glycation and the formation of “advanced glycation end products” or “AGE” (3Bailey A.J. Paul R.G. Knott L. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 106: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 4Brownlee M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), as shown in SchemeFS1. It is clear from such studies that not all lysines behave equivalently, and several of these studies indicate that factors other than accessibility, in particular the existence of a catalytic microenvironment, play an important role in determining the site of glycation and the nature of the subsequent chemistry (5Acharya A.S.

In a number of studies involving glycation and the formation of other adducts, histidine has been proposed to play an important role in determining the reactivity of nearby lysine residues. Shilton and Walton (8Shilton B.H. Walton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5587-5592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Shilton et al. (9Shilton B.H. Campbell R.L. Walton D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have proposed that the imidazole group of His-348 facilitates the Amadori chemistry with Lys-231 in alcohol dehydrogenase via acid-base catalysis. In particular, a base supplied either by the buffer or by a nearby residue can facilitate the Amadori rearrangement by removing the proton from carbon 2 of the Schiff base-linked aldimine, and the subsequent tautomerizations are also subject to acid-base catalysis. Miyataet al. (11Miyata T. Inagi R. Wada Y. Ueda Y. Ilda Y. Takahashi M. Taniguchi N. Maeda K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12215-12221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) similarly proposed that His-31 catalyzed Amadori rearrangement of the glycated adduct at Ile-1 in human β2-microglobulin. In bovine ribonuclease A, the highest degree of Amadori chemistry was reported to occur at Lys-41 (6Watkins N.G. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10629-10639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the Lys-41 amino group is located in close proximity to the His-12 side chain (12Wlodawer A. Sjolin L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic role of histidine in this chemistry has led to the hypothesis that the histidine-containing dipeptide carnosine (β-alanyl-histidine) may play a protective role in cells by rapidly forming adducts with excess sugars (13Baldwin J.S.

Reactions were performed at 37 °C with 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer in 100% D2O (pH 7.4), 40 mm [1-13C]acetyl salicylic acid, and 8.3 mm wt ubiquitin or 0.4 mm H68N mutant. Each spectrum consisted of 2,048 complex data points with a spectral width of 4,504.5 Hz in the t2 dimension, yielding an acquisition time of 0.455 s with 13C WALTZ16 decoupling during acquisition, an interpulse delay of 0.4 s, a scalar evolution delay of 61 ms, and a 0.4-s presaturation pulse. To null the acetate peak, an inverse BIRD sequence was performed before the HMQC and consisted of a scalar evolution delay of 78.1 ms, a presaturation pulse of 0.4 s, and a 1.063-s delay. The t1 dimension had a spectral width of 628.6 Hz and 64 increments and was collected in phase-sensitive mode. The two-dimensional spectra were zero-filled to 2,048 points in t1, and apodization consisted of a shifted sine-bell function. Peak volumes were calculated using the Varian VNMR software (version 5.3b). Spectra were referenced to aspirin at 174.2 ppm (13C) and 2.34 ppm (1H). In comparing the data for the wt and H68N mutant that were present at different concentrations, the peak volumes from the H68N time course were normalized by applying a weighting factor to all H68N peak volumes. The weighting factor is the ratio of the absolute peak volumes of acetyl-Lys-48 resonance obtained for wt ubiquitin relative to the H68N mutant obtained at the last data point (24 h).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure FS1Formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As noted above, Hayden et al. (2Hayden P.J. Yang Y. Ward A.J.I. Dulik D.M. McCann D.J. Stevens J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) found that imidazole and phenol catalyzed adduct formation with metabolically generated thionoacyl fluorides. Khalifah and Sutherland (15Khalifah R.G. Sutherland W.M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) found that imidazole stimulated alkylation of alcohol dehydrogenase at low concentrations but was inhibitory at high concentrations. Thus, the effects of added molecules can be complex, involving both catalytic activation and competition for modification. Another complicating factor is the unique active site chemistry of each enzyme, which can trap or specifically bind particular agents. In the present study, we have used two-dimensional NMR methods to study the acetylation of a very well characterized protein, ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is a particularly attractive target for such studies because of the wealth of available structural data, the lack of an active site with its specific catalytic chemistry, and the presence of a single histidine residue located in the vicinity of Lys-6. NMR studies of the modification of ubiquitin and its H68N mutant offer a more direct approach to the analysis of the role of surface functionality in protein adduct formation. Ubiquitin was obtained from Sigma. Methylene chloride, pyridine, deuterium oxide, deuterium chloride, and deuterium hydroxide were purchased from Aldrich. Potassium phosphate dibasic and monobasic salts were purchased from Mallinckrodt. For dialysis, 2-kDa molecular mass cutoff slide-A-Lyzer™ cassettes were purchased from Pierce. Salicylic acid was purchased from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY). Ethanol was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [1,1′-13C2]Acetic anhydride and [1-13C]acetyl chloride were purchased from Isotec, Inc. (Miamisburg, OH). [1-13C]Acetyl salicylic acid was synthesized following an approach similar to that described by Gerig et al. (16Gerig J.T. Katz K.E. Reinheimer J.D. Sullivan G.R. Roberts J.D. Org. Magn. Reson. 1981; 15: 158-161Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) by the reaction of [1-13C]acetyl chloride with salicylic acid. Salicylic acid (1.5 g) was dissolved in 90 ml of methylene chloride containing 1.8 ml of pyridine. A solution of 20% [1-13C]acetyl chloride (2.8 ml) in methylene chloride (11.2 ml) was added (14 ml total volume). The reaction container was capped and allowed to react for 15 h at 22 °C. The reaction container was uncapped, the methylene chloride was evaporated by heating (∼45 °C), and the sample was then lyophilized. The purity of the [1-13C]acetyl salicylic acid was determined by1H NMR to be >99%. The isotopically labeled aspirin was stored in a dessicator at 0 °C. All NMR studies were performed on a Varian UNITY Plus 500-MHz NMR spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA). HMQC1 spectra were obtained using a 5-mm Nalorac triple resonance probe (Martinez, CA). Typical HMQC spectral parameters were as follows: spectral width of 4,504.5 Hz and 2,048 complex data points yielding an acquisition of 0.455 s with13C WALTZ16 decoupling during acquisition, relaxation delay of 0.4 s, scalar evolution delay of 61 ms, and a 0.4-s presaturation pulse. Typically, the t1 dimension had a spectral width of 628.6 Hz and 64 increments and was collected in phase-sensitive mode. The number of increments and/or transients were varied to obtain the required resolution or signal-to-noise ratio. Two-dimensional spectra were zero-filled to 2,048 points in t1, and apodization consisted of a shifted sine-bell function. Peak volumes were calculated using the Varian VNMR software (version 5.3b) and referenced to aspirin at 174.2 ppm (13C) and 2.34 ppm (1H) when visible in the two-dimensional spectrum; all shift values are in ppm. When acetic anhydride was used as the acetylating agent, the position of the acetyl-Lys-33 resonance was set at δ1H, δ13C = 2.073 ppm, 174.50 ppm. Lys-33 is one of the more highly acetylated lysine residues in ubiquitin, and its chemical shift is essentially pH-independent between pH 4.95 and 9.8 (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The kinetics of aspirin acetylation of wt ubiquitin and H68N mutants were studied using a solution containing 8.3 mm ubiquitin or 0.4 mm H68N mutant and 40 mm[1-13C]acetyl salicylic acid in 0.2 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in 100% D2O at a temperature of 37 °C. Although a high concentration of ubiquitin was used in this study to facilitate peak quantification, we found that we obtained very similar results at much lower ubiquitin concentrations; i.e.the relative reactivities of the amino groups is approximately independent of concentration (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition to the HMQC parameters described above, an inverse BIRD pulse was placed in front of the HMQC sequence to suppress the increasing acetate signal that co-resonates with the signals of interest. The inverse BIRD sequence is essentially a spin echo with a scalar evolution delay of 78.1 ms, a presaturation pulse of 0.4 s, and a 1.063-s delay before the start of the HMQC sequence. Each spectrum was composed of 32 transients, resulting in a temporal resolution of 3 h. Peak volumes were calculated using the Varian VNMR software (version 5.3b). A threshold was chosen that was visually above the noise level, and the volume borders were automatically selected by the Varian software. Both peak volumes and peak heights were calculated based on the peak volume integration calculation and peak picking procedure of the software, respectively. Both measurements gave similar results, but only the peak volumes were used for graphing time courses of the reactions. Time-dependent studies of acetic anhydride acetylation of wt ubiquitin and the H68N mutant were performed using a solution containing 4 mm ubiquitin or 0.66 mm H68N mutant and 110 mm[1,1′-13C2]acetic anhydride in 0.22m phosphate buffer in D2O (uncorrected meter reading of pH 7.4) at a temperature of 25 °C. A preliminary kinetic study was performed to determine the optimum temporal spacing of data points. The same two-dimensional HMQC NMR parameters as described above were used. Addition of the stock acetic anhydride solutions to the protein samples resulted in initial pH values of 6.85 and 7.2 for the wt and H68N samples, respectively, which decreased to 6.50 and 6.40 after 10 h and 18 h, respectively. Additional kinetic studies were performed with 4 mm ubiquitin and 4 m or 8m [1,1′-13C2]acetic anhydride in 0.25 m phosphate buffer (pH 5.9) in 100% D2O at a temperature of 25 °C to evaluate the effects of higher levels of acetylation. In each of these experiments, the transient resonances assigned to acetyl-His-68 were observed. Unequivocal assignment of the acetyl-Lys-6 resonance was achieved by reacting 20 mm [1-13C]acetyl salicylate with the 0.4 mm UbK6R mutant. Acetate and unreacted aspirin were removed by dialysis, and a 1H-13C HMQC spectrum of the resulting acetylated UbK6R mutant was obtained, confirming our previous assignment (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown previously (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), incubation of wt ubiquitin with [1-13C]acetyl salicylate results in the time-dependent formation of six adducts that give rise to resolved resonances in two-dimensional HMQC spectra. These adduct resonances have been previously assigned, and it was found that Lys-6 is the most rapidly acetylated residue, followed by Lys-48 and Lys-63. Although the order of acetylation parallels the surface availability of the residues, differences in calculated surface contact areas derived using the Connolly algorithm are in general insufficient to explain these differences. Lys-6 and Lys-48 are located near His-68 and Tyr-59, respectively. This might result in enhanced acetylation by aspirin due to pi-pi bonding or Van der Waals interactions between the aspirin and the aromatic residues. Alternatively, the proximity of Lys-6 to His-68 (the Lys-6 ε-amino is 4.7 Å from the imidazole C-2 carbon in the crystal (18Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar)) introduces several alternative possible mechanisms for enhancing adduct formation. A series of HMQC spectra corresponding to 3-h accumulation periods was obtained for both the wt ubiquitin and the H68N mutant in the presence of 40 mm[1-13C]acetyl salicylate. Unexpectedly, the substitution of asparagine for histidine resulted in very little shift perturbation for the adduct acetyl resonances. We therefore confirmed our previous assignment (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of acetyl-Lys-6 by analysis of the acetylated UbK6R mutant, as described under “Materials and Methods.” This result indicates that there is no strong interaction between these side chains at the surface of the protein. The time-dependent HMQC resonance intensities for the Lys-6 and Lys-48 adducts obtained using both the wild type protein and the H68N mutant are shown in Fig.1. From these data, it is apparent that, in contrast to the chemical shift results noted above, the nearby histidine residue does make a significant contribution to the reactivity of Lys-6. Thus, the rate of modification of Lys-6 in the H68N mutant is found to be fairly similar to the rate for Lys-48 adduct formation. These results indicate a significant promotion of the adduct formation at Lys-6 resulting from the nearby His-68 residue (Fig.2). The use of acetic anhydride as a protein acetylating agent is expected to result in a greater degree of acetylation of less accessible target groups, as well as more extensive acetylation of histidine residues (19Moore G.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1985; 26: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Kinnunen P.M. DeMichele A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7344-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In a study of the acetylation of prothrombin by acetic anhydride, acetylation of one of the histidyl residues was found to proceed so rapidly that substantial amounts of the diacetylated species were formed, with the doubly acetylated imidazole ring decomposing to yield a di-N-acetylated side chain with an opened imidazole ring and loss of the ring C-2 carbon (21Welsch D.J. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7513-7519Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).1H-13C HMQC studies of both ubiquitin and UbH68N performed using 110 mm[1,1′-13C2]acetic anhydride confirm the greater acetylation of a residue corresponding to chemical shifts of1H and 13C of 2.06 and 174.26 ppm, respectively, which we have previously assigned to the N-terminal methionine amino group. This result is consistent with preliminary mass spectrometry data indicating a high level of acetylation of Met-1 by acetic anhydride (22Wunderlin, M. (1994) Diplom. thesis, University of Konstanz, Germany.Google Scholar). In addition, two small resonances are observed in the upper right-hand region of the spectrum (Fig. 3 A) at δ1H, δ13C = 1.864, 174.375 and 1.838, 174.31 ppm that are found to disappear gradually over subsequent 3-h spectral accumulation periods (Fig. 3, B andC). Such time-dependent resonance intensities presumably correspond to labile acetyl histidine or acetyl tyrosine adducts. The presence of two closely spaced resonances (Δ13C = 0.055 ppm; Δ1H = 0.018 ppm) would be consistent with the formation of an acetyl histidine adduct acetylated at either Nε or Nτ (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In principle, acetylation of histidine can also lead to more complex spectra because of the formation of the diacetylated species and ofcis/trans isomers of each of the acetyl imidazole bonds (Δ13C = 0.04 ppm; Δ1H < 0.0005 ppm) (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hence, these spectra are most readily interpreted in terms of the formation of a labile acetyl histidine adduct. Further support for this conclusion is derived from studies of the acetylation of UbH68N by [1,1′-13C2]acetic anhydride, in which these adduct resonances are not observed (figure not shown). Remarkably, although the acetylation of ubiquitin by acetic anhydride proceeds sufficiently rapidly so that the reaction is essentially complete by the first observation period (Fig.4 A), the time-dependent loss of intensity of the resonances assigned to acetyl-His-68 are paralleled by a time-dependent increase in the intensity of acetyl-Lys-6. In contrast, we observed no time-dependent increase in the acetyl-Lys-6 resonance of UbH68N after treatment with the same concentration of acetic anhydride (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate a direct transfer of the [1-13C]acetyl moiety from acetyl-His-68 to Lys-6, as shown in Scheme FS2. This behavior is consistent with the fact that acetyl imidazole is itself an acetylating agent that has been used in many studies (23Riordan J.F. Wacker W.E. C Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1758-1765Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 24de Satz V.B. Santome J.A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1981; 18: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Kaliman P.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5775-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, the apparent decrease in intensity of some of the acetyl lysine resonances in Fig. 4 probably results from minor precipitation of the acetylated ubiquitin, which is more significant for the more highly acetylated species.Figure FS2Direct and histidine-mediated pathways for acetylation of Lys-6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another interesting feature of these spectra is the non-symmetric appearance of the contour corresponding to acetyl-Lys-63, which becomes particularly apparent under conditions of high levels of acetylation of the protein by acetic anhydride (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 shows a two-dimensional 1H-13C HMQC spectrum of 4.0 mm ubiquitin and 8 m acetic anhydride obtained 5.5 h into the reaction time course. In this case, the intensity of the resonance previously assigned to acetyl-Met-1 is significantly greater than in the previous study using aspirin (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the acetyl-Lys-63 resonance now appears as two overlapping signals. In the crystal, the N–S distance of 3.6 Å corresponding to the Lys-63 Nα and the Met-1 sulfur has been suggested to correspond to a hydrogen bonding interaction (18Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Hence, the data suggest that under the conditions of a high level of acetylation of the N-terminal methionine residue, there is a structural perturbation, possibly mediated by a hydrogen bonding interaction, which leads to a small shift of the resonance for acetyl-Lys-63. The above results provide strong support for the conclusion that surface catalysis can contribute to the formation of adducts of proteins and, presumably, other macromolecules. In contrast to catalysis at the active site of proteins, in which very precise structural relationships are maintained, the effects observed here occur in the presence of only an average proximity of flexible side chains. Thus, for example, in the crystal structure of ubiquitin the mean ratio of the B-factors for the ε-amino and α-amino groups of Lys-6 is 3.4; the ratio of the imidazole nuclei to the α-amino of His-68 is 4.6 (18Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). The lack of a well defined interaction is also reflected in the fact that the acetyl-Lys-6 resonance shifts were nearly unaffected by the H68N residue substitution. In general, the catalytic effect observed could arise from a histidine-assisted deprotonation of the lysine side chain amino group or via the intermediacy of an acetyl histidine adduct. Support for the first alternative can be derived from the reduced pK avalue observed for dimethyl-Lys-6 in reductively methylated ubiquitin (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternatively, acetyl imidazole is an established acetylating agent, so the formation of a reactive acetyl imidazole side chain provides a very reasonable explanation for these results (Fig. 4). Based on ubiquitin amine surface accessibility alone (17Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), one would predict that the smaller, more reactive protein-modifying agent, acetic anhydride, would have a similar residue acetylation profile to aspirin. However, Lys-6 is the third most reactive at an acetic anhydride:ubiquitin molar ratio of 13:1 (Fig. 4). The basis for this difference in reactivity is unknown at present. At very high acetic anhydride:ubiquitin ratios, the intensities for the acetyl lysine resonances of the accessible residues tend to become more similar, indicating a more complete degree of modification (e.g. Fig.5, obtained at a ratio of 2000:1). Transient acetyl histidine adducts have previously been reported using other methods of detection (19Moore G.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1985; 26: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Kinnunen P.M. DeMichele A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7344-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The factors involved in the observation of transient acetyl histidine adducts by NMR are not completely clear at present. The data obtained demonstrate that the potential significance of a catalytic microenvironment extends beyond the example of the Amadori rearrangement of Schiff's bases to other types of adducts formed with macromolecules. In fact, the most highly acetylated lysine residues by aspirin in albumin (27Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1975; 66: 173-175Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and hemoglobin (28Xu A.S.L. Macdonald J.M. Labotka R.J. London R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) are within several Ångstroms of a histidine residue, and transient acetyl histidine adducts may be responsible for the enhanced reactivity of certain lysine residues in these proteins as well. In addition to the role of histidine discussed above, other residues can presumably play analogous catalytic roles. Aspartyl and glutamyl carboxyl groups have also been found in the vicinity of highly glycated lysyl residues (6Watkins N.G. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10629-10639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Baldwin J.S. Lee L. Leung T.K. Muruganandam A. Mutus B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similarly, tyrosyl side chains could be transiently acetylated and become involved in analogous transacetylation reactions (2Hayden P.J. Yang Y. Ward A.J.I. Dulik D.M. McCann D.J. Stevens J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It seems likely that all of the catalytic effects observed at the active sites of enzymes may play a role in non-enzymatic protein modification, although the effects in general are expected to be considerably smaller because of the lack of defined surface residue stereochemical constraints (29Svensson L.A. Sjolin L. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Wlodawer A. Proteins. 1986; 1: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)."

This 40-kDa protein shares approximately 65% amino acid identity with mammalian p38-α isoforms. Mipk was one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in immature oocytes arrested at the G2/M transition of meiosis I. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Mipk was increased in response to anisomycin, heat, and osmotic shock of oocytes. During 1-methyladenine-induced oocyte maturation, Mipk underwent tyrosine dephosphorylation and remained dephosphorylated in mature oocytes and during the early mitotic cell divisions until approximately 12 h after fertilization. At the time of differentiation and acquisition of G phases in the developing embryos, Mipk was rephosphorylated on tyrosine. In oocytes that were microinjected with Mipk antisense oligonucleotides and subsequently were allowed to mature and become fertilized, differentiation was blocked. Because MipK antisense oligonucleotides and a dominant-negative (K62R)Mipk when microinjected into immature oocytes failed to induce germinal vesicle breakdown, inhibition of Mipk function was not sufficient by itself to cause oocyte maturation. These findings point to a putative role for Mipk in cell cycle control as a G-phase-promoting factor. A p38MAPK homolog Mipk (meiosis-inhibited protein kinase) was cloned from seastar oocytes.

Oocytes in many animal species are arrested naturally in the first meiotic prophase or late G2 phase (1Masui Y. Clarke H.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1979; 57: 185-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 2Murray A. Hunt T. The Cell Cycle: An Introduction. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993Google Scholar). Hormonal stimulation releases the oocytes from this block, promoting transition of the cells through meiosis I to a second developmental arrest point before or after meiosis II in preparation for fertilization (3Sagata N. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 22-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Early events in meiosis I include disintegration of the nuclear envelope leading to germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD),1 chromosome condensation, and a dramatic reorganization of many cellular structures. Many of these changes are mediated through the activation of protein kinases (reviewed in Ref. 4Pelech S.L. Charest D.L. Meijer L. Guidet S. Tung H.Y.L. MAP kinase-dependent Pathways in Cell Cycle Control. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 1. Plenum Press, New York.1995: 33-52Google Scholar). In seastar oocytes, whose maturation is induced with the hormone 1-methyladenine, several protein kinases appear to contribute to the global protein phosphorylation that precedes GVBD (5Guerrier P. Moreau M. Doree M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 7: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Remarkably, some of these kinases, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (6Sadler K.C. Ruderman J.V. Dev. Biol. 1998; 197: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), ribosomal S6 kinase (7Charlton L. Sayed M. Clark-Lewis I. Aebersold R. Pelech S.L. J. Cell.

J. 1992; 283: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) appear to mediate the re-entry of G0-arrested somatic cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle, despite the profound differences in the end points. Activation of both somatic cells and oocytes rapidly leads to changes in phospholipid metabolism, transient elevation of free intracellular calcium, a rise in intracellular pH, alteration of the cytoskeleton, and dramatic switches in the patterns of gene transcription and mRNA translation (11Ruderman J.V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The 34-kDa cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1, also known as maturation-promoting factor (MPF), is a histone H1 kinase that undergoes cyclic regulation during sea oocyte maturation. Following fertilization, the kinase becomes periodically inhibited just prior to each meiotic and mitotic cell cleavage (8Meijer L. Pelech S.L. Krebs E.G.

Activation of Cdk1 has been correlated with production of cyclin B, phosphorylation of the Thr-167 site by Cdk7, and dephosphorylation of the Tyr-15 site by fission yeast Cdc25-related phosphatases. Seastar Cdk7 has been shown to be associated with cyclin H and a third stabilizing partner, Mat1 (17Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5027-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). One of the first members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) family to be identified was the seastar 44-kDa maturation-activated protein kinase (Mapk), which strongly phosphorylates myelin basic proteinin vitro (14Pelech S.L. Tombes R.M. Krebs E.G. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Sanghera J.S. Paddon H.B. Bader S.A. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

The precise function of Mapk in oocyte maturation remains equivocal and seems to differ in part from the activity of its counterpart p42 erk2 in the maturing frog oocyte. In Xenopus laevis Erk2 appears to play a role in the formation of the active MPF complex, whereas in the seastar, maximal Mapk stimulation occurs after the initiation of GVBD and later than MPF activation (20Abrieu A. Doree M. Picard A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that MAP kinases may act to prevent DNA synthesis during seastar and frog oocyte maturation. Following fertilization of frog oocytes, Erk2 becomes tyrosine dephosphorylated and remains inactive during the early mitotic division (21Posada J. Sanghera J. Pelech S. Aebersold R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have observed similar results for Mapk in fertilized seastar oocytes (22Lefebvre D.L. Charest D.L. Yee A. Crawford B. Pelech S.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 272-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Like Erk1 and Erk2, Mapk possesses a Thr-Glu-Tyr motif, which must be phosphorylated on the tyrosine residue by a Mek-like kinase for maximal activation. 2D. L. Charest, A. Yee, and S. L. Pelech, unpublished data. While Mek can be activated upon phosphorylation of the two serine residues in a Ser-Met-Ala-Asn-Ser motif by p37 mos (23Posada J. Yew N. Ahn N.G. Vande Woude G.F.

The occurrence of other MAP kinases besides Mapk has not been reported in the seastar. The initial objective of the present study was to detect and characterize other proteins that undergo marked changes in tyrosine phosphorylation during seastar oocyte maturation. Herein, we describe the major 40-kDa protein that becomes tyrosine dephosphorylated during seastar oocyte maturation and rephosphorylated on tyrosine within 12 h after fertilization. Purification and sequencing permitted its identification as a member of the p38 hog subfamily of MAP kinases. Our findings indicate a possible unrecognized role for stress-activated protein kinases in cell cycle control as G-phase-promoting factors. The mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and the following primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against synthetic peptides were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY): Erk1-CT (CGGPFTFDMELDDLPKERLKELIFQETARFQPGAPEAP), Pstaire (EGVPSTAIREISLLKEGGC), Cdk5-CT (CNPVQRISAEEALQHP), and p38 Hog-CT (CDEVISFVPPPLDQEEMES). The phosphorylation site-specific polyclonal antibody for p38MAPK was bought from New England BioLabs. The various mouse monoclonal antibodies generated against recombinant human p38 hog-α were from AbProbes (Portland, Maine). The secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Bio-Rad. Purified seastar Mapk, expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, was provided by Dr. David Charest (Dept. of Medicine, University of British Columbia). The cDNA for human p38 hog-α was generously provided by Dr. Roger Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Worchester, MA). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Canada (Oakville, ON) and ICN (Aurora, OH). All other reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. Pisaster ochraceusseastars were collected from beaches in the greater Vancouver area. For the preparation of immature and mature oocytes, the cells were isolated from ovaries and treated with 10 μm 1-methyladenine in natural sea water (NSW) as described (18Sanghera J.S. Paddon H.B. Bader S.A. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fraser A. Gomez J. Hartwick E.B. Smith M.J. Can. J. Zool. 1981; 59: 1700-1707Crossref Google Scholar). Maturation was marked by GVBD with the disappearance of the nucleus, and this typically occurred within 90 min after 1-methyladenine addition for at least 80% of the oocyte population. For the preparation of P. ochraceus embryos, mature oocytes were collected from seastars that had been injected with 140 μm 1-methyladenine in filtered NSW (26Fraser A. Gomez J. Hartwick E.B. Smith M.J. Can. J. Zool. 1981; 59: 1700-1707Crossref Google Scholar). Equilibrated mature oocytes were fertilized by addition of seastar sperm at a final effective dilution of 1:20,000 (v/v). For the heat and osmotic shock experiments, oocytes were isolated from seastars that had been kept in captivity for at least 4 months under constant light. These oocytes matured in response to 10 μm 1-methyladenine, essentially as observed for oocytes obtained from seastars harvested during the spawning season (May to mid-July). To study the effect of heat shock, oocytes from individual seastars were resuspended in a measured volume of NSW preheated to 25 or 35 °C. To investigate the effect of osmotic shock, oocytes from individual seastars were resuspended at 12 °C in NSW containing 1.0m NaCl (based on the initial concentration of NaCl in NSW as 0.5 m). For the zero time points, aliquots of the oocyte suspensions were immediately removed and pelleted, the sea water was aspirated, and the oocytes were quick frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Fresh or frozen pellets of oocytes or embryos were resuspended in 2× volume of chilled homogenizing buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.25 μm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0 mm benzamidine). Large batches of oocytes were homogenized in a Waring blender in 2 × 15 s bursts, whereas small batches were sonicated with 2 × 30 s bursts. The homogenates were centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman J2-HS centrifuge to remove particulate matter and organelles. The postmitochondrial supernatant was centrifuged in a Sorval Combi ultracentrifuge (Dupont, Canada) at 250,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were immediately aliquoted and frozen at −70 °C until required. For the osmotic shock time course experiments, because of the ∼5-fold increase in cell volume with medium containing 1m NaCl, it was necessary to homogenize each cell pellet in a fixed final volume. Therefore, to each cell pellet of ∼2.1 × 105 packed cells was added 900 μl of 5× concentrated homogenization buffer, and the volumes were adjusted to 6 ml with water prior to cell lysis with 2 × 30 s bursts with a sonicator. For the fertilized oocytes and embryos, cells were pelleted at 4 °C in a Beckman J2-HS centrifuge (1500 rpm for 5 min). A 33% (v/v) suspension was prepared in chilled homogenization buffer, and the embryos were disrupted with 2 × 30 s bursts at 19,000 rpm of a Polytron (PT3000, Brinkman). Homogenates were immediately centrifuged in a Sorval Combi ultracentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min, followed by ultracentrifugation of the supernatants at 250,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant cytosols were stored in aliquots at -70 °C. Proteins were quantitated by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. For samples containing Brij, the absorbance at 280 nm was measured for each sample, and the protein concentration calculated as follows: protein concentration (mg/ml) =A 280 × 1.55. Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) of the cytosolic cell extracts was performed on a 1-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Up to 5 mg of cytosolic protein was diluted to 2.1 ml with Buffer A (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4). Two ml of sample were applied to the column, and the column was developed with a 10-ml 0–0.8m NaCl linear gradient with collection of 0.25-ml fractions. In some experiments, select Resource Q fractions were subjected to FPLC on a 20-ml Superose 12 column equilibrated and developed with Buffer B (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmNa2VO3, and 0.25 mm dithiothreitol) and 0.2 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) with 1.5-mm polyacrylamide gels (4% stacking gels and 10% separating gels). Silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels was performed by the method of Merrilet al. (29Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose membranes (BDH) was carried out at 4 °C for 3 h at 300 mA with a Hoeffer Transfer Cell in the presence of transfer buffer (20 mm Tris, 120 mm glycine, 20% methanol (v/v), pH 8.6). Transferred proteins were visualized with Ponceau S or 0.1% Amido Black in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid (w/v/v) for 15–30 min at room temperature with shaking. Destaining of Amido Black was carried out in a 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid (v/v) solution. Western blotting was performed with primary antibodies in accordance with the supplier's instruction using nitrocellulose membranes that were blocked with 5% skim milk (w/v) in TBS (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) for 2 h. Following incubation for 0.5–2 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, Western blots were developed with a mixture of 1 ml of 1.5% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (ICN) in 100% dimethylformamide, 1 ml of 3% nitro blue tetrazolium (BDH) in 1 ml of 70% dimethylformamide, and 100 ml of 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, 0.1m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Development was terminated by soaking in deionized H2O. For 4G10 blots, blocking of the membrane was achieved using 3% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in NTBS (0.5% Nonidet-P40 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and 50 mmNaCl) with incubations of 4 and 2 h, respectively. For immunoprecipitation of proteins from cell extracts and column fractions, samples were adjusted to 1% SDS (w/v) with addition of 20% SDS, and then diluted with an equal volume of 6% NETF (6% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) in NETF buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF)). The samples were first precleared by incubation at 4 °C for 15 min with rotation with 10 μl of a protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) slurry in 3% Nonidet P-40 in NETF buffer, followed by removal of the beads by centrifugation for 1 min at 15,000 rpm. 10 μg of antibody were incubated with the supernatants for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry and further incubation for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 6% NETF and once with NETF. Immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in 4× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Approximately 3.4 g of cytosolic extract were thawed, diluted to 1:10 with Buffer C (5 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, and 0.25 mmdithiothreitol) and applied to six 10-g hydroxylapatite columns (Bio-Rad). Each column was eluted with a 350-ml 0–0.14 mpotassium phosphate (pH 7.2) linear gradient; Mipk eluted in 0.034–0.05 m phosphate. Peak Mipk fractions were diluted 6-fold with Buffer B and applied to two 25-ml Q-Sepharose columns. Proteins were eluted with a 280-ml 0–0.8 m NaCl linear gradient in Buffer B; Mipk eluted between 0.25–0.30 mNaCl. Peak Mipk fractions were diluted 7-fold in Buffer B and applied to a 25-ml heparin-Sepharose column. Mipk did not bind to the heparin-Sepharose, and the flow-through was loaded onto a 25-ml polylysine-agarose column. This column was developed with a 280-ml linear gradient of 0–0.8 m NaCl; Mipk eluted between 0.29–0.33 m NaCl. The peak Mipk fractions were then adjusted to a final concentration of 1 m NaCl and applied to a 5-ml phenyl-Sepharose column and eluted with a 75-ml NaCl/Brij linear gradient, from 1 m NaCl, 0% Brij to 0 mNaCl, 1.5% Brij. Mipk was released between 0.57 m NaCl, 0.65% Brij and 0.53 m NaCl, 0.7% Brij. For protein microsequencing of enriched Mipk, the purification was scaled up by 5-fold to start with 16 g of immature seastar oocyte cytosolic protein and 24 hydroxylapatite, six Q-Sepharose, three polylysine-agarose, three phenyl-Sepharose, and one Resource Q column were used. When the heparin-agarose column was omitted, the order of the polylysine-agarose and phenyl-Sepharose steps were reversed, and a Resource Q column was added as an extra purification step. The polylysine fractions were diluted 1:1 with Buffer B prior to application on to a 1-ml Resource Q column. The Resource Q column was developed with a 10-ml linear gradient of 0–0.8 m NaCl and 250-μl fractions were collected. Mipk eluted with 0.42–0.44m NaCl. The 2-peak Mipk fractions from the Resource Q column were loaded into one lane of an 11% SDS-PAGE gel. Following SDS-PAGE, the resolved proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Western blotting with Cdk5-CT antibody and Amido Black staining. The Mipk band was excised and placed in deionized H2O to prevent drying out. This band was subject to trypsinolysis and protein microsequencing as described (30Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA isolation from 300 μl of packed immature P. ochraceus oocytes was performed using the RNeasy isolation kit from Qiagen. mRNA preparations were made using the Qiagen Oligotex mRNA kit. From approximately 440 μg of total seastar RNA, 4–22 μg of mRNA in 60 μl were isolated. The PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp RNA PCR kit was used in the synthesis of P. ochraceus cDNA from 10 ng of mRNA. For degenerate PCR, Mipk peptide sequences were aligned with the human p38 protein sequence. From this information, degenerate oligonucleotides were designed in orientations that permitted amplifications of a ∼576-base pair fragment: (S2 sense, 5′-GA(T/C)GA(A/G)CA(T/C)GTICA(A/G)TTC-3′; S5 antisense, 5′-TTIGCIAC(A/G)TAIGGATG-3′); and a ∼360-base pair fragment (S4 sense, 5′-CCIGTICA(A/G)TA(T/C)CA(A/G)AAA-3′; S2 antisense, 5′-AA(T/C)TGIAC(A/G)TG(T/C)TC(A/G)TC-3′). The PCR reaction conditions with Taq polymerase were an initial 1 min at 94 °C, 45 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 35 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 90 s, followed by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C to fill all ends. The amplified fragments were cloned into the vector pBluescript SK(-) and the cDNA sequence determined. Cloning into T-tailed pBluescript SK(-) vector was based on the procedure of Holton and Graham (31Holton T.A. Graham M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Transformations using the pBluescript vector into DH5a competent E. coli cells plated on Luria Broth, ampicillin, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) agar were performed as described (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989: 1-68Google Scholar). Small quantities of plasmids were prepared using the Qiagen QIAprep Plasmid kit, whereas large quantity DNA preparations were performed using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit. 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions were performed using the CLONTECH Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (33Chenchik A. Diachenko L. Moqadam F. Tarabykin V. Lukyanov S. Siebert P.D. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PCR amplifications of the 3′- and 5′-ends of the Mipk cDNA were undertaken with the CLONTECHAdvantage KlenTaq polymerase mix. To 5 μl of diluted Ad-cDNA were added 5 μl of 10× KlenTaq buffer, 20 μm dNTPs, 0.2 μm gene-specific primer (sense primers for 3′-RACE: 5′-AAACTCTCCGCAGTGGGAGC-3′ or antisense primers for 5′-RACE: 5′-GATGACTCAGTGCCTCTTCAG-3′), 0.2 μm adaptor primer 1. A touchdown PCR method of amplification was used with the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 70 °C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 68 °C for 3 min and final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The reaction products were purified on a low melting point agarose gel, and the appropriate product was used for ligation using the method of Kalvakolanu and Livingston (34Kalvakolanu D.V.R. Livingston W.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 176-177PubMed Google Scholar). Clones were sequenced by automated fluorescent DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (35Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar) and ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The construction of kinase-inactive (K62R)Mipk using PCR site-directed mutagenesis was based on the method of Ali and Steinkasserer (36Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar) and used the primers: antisense KR (5′-GCGGATAGCAATCTTTATGCCAG-3′), STOPS, sense KK (5′-AAGCTTTCTCGACCATTTCAG-3′) and ATGE. Gluthionine S-transferase (GST) Mipk fusion proteins were produced in 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG)-treated DH5a or UT5600 E. coli cells according to manufacturer's instructions (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989: 1-68Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1–5 ml of lysis buffer (1 ml of STE-500 (500 mm NaCl in TE buffer), 1 mg of lysozyme, 1 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min, sonicated 3 × 15 s, and centrifuged in an Eppendorf tube at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. 100 μl of GST-agarose slurry was added to the supernatant and allowed to incubate for 1–2 h with rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed with STE-500 buffer and phosphate-buffered saline before being resuspended in an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline. These beads were then either stored at −70 °C or used for thrombin cleavage. For thrombin cleavage, 1 unit of thrombin was added to 100 μl of GST fusion protein-agarose slurry in phosphate-buffered saline and incubation continued at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of benzamidine-Sepharose slurry (in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant with cleaved Mipk was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until required. Seastar oocytes in filtered NSW at 6 °C were sorted visually with a dissecting microscope (WILD-M3B) at × 16 power. At this magnification, oocytes (150 μm in diameter, ∼2500 picoliters in volume) were inspected, and healthy immature oocytes were individually picked and transferred to the microinjection slide. Usually about 20 oocytes were placed in 100 μl of NSW on each slide. The NSW was localized within a ring of rubber cement 1 cm in diameter made with a PAP pen (The Binding Site, Institute of Research and Development, Birmingham, United Kingdom). The glass slides were kept at a temperature of 12–13 °C on a three-eighths of an inch thick aluminum plate on a thermoelectric cold plate (Thermoelectrics Unlimited Inc.). Evaporation was minimized by using a blue plastic cap from a 15-ml centrifuge tube (Falcon) to cover the seawater ring. Microinjection of the oocytes was performed using a Leitz Labovert FS inverted microscope with differential interference contrast optics. The microscope was flanked by right and left Leitz micromanipulators, which held the injection needles and holding pipettes, respectively. During the microinjection, the slide was kept at 10–12 °C using a refrigerated microscope stage based on a Peltier element, receiving variable direct current 12 V, 0–2 A. Injections of 50–150 picoliters of samples were performed as judged by the initial diameter of the injected materials. For the oligonucleotide injections, Mipk sense-1 (5′-ATGAACAACCCAGTAACAGGA-3′), Mipk antisense-1 (5′-TCCTGTTACTGGGTTGTTCAT-3′), and Mipk antisense-2 (5′-CTGAACCGGCACCTCCCA-3′) were diluted to 100 μm in sterile water and filtered through 0.45-μm filters prior to microinjection of approximately 65 μg of each oligonucleotide. For the (K62R)Mipk, Mapk, and SB203580 p38 hog inhibitor studies, oocytes were injected with approximately 10 pg of the recombinant (K62R)Mipk or 2 μm final concentration of SB203580 and monitored for ∼24 h for spontaneous maturation events. In all microinjection experiments, the injected oocytes were allowed to incubate at 10 °C for about 24 h to allow protein turnover to occur. Spontaneous maturations were quantitated prior to maturation of the oocytes with 10 μm 1-methyladenine. The oocytes were allowed to mature for 4 h and then fertilized as described above. Relatively few proteins undergo alterations in their state of tyrosine phosphorylation (as visualized with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody) when seastar oocytes are released from their block at the G2/M border of the cell cycle by the natural hormone 1-methyladenine to resume meiotic maturation (Fig. 1, A andE). By the onset of GVBD prior to the first meiotic cell division, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the MAP kinase p44 mapk (Fig. 1, B and F) and the dephosphorylation of p34 cdk1 (Fig. 1,C and G) were evident as described previously (8Meijer L. Pelech S.L."

In this report, we investigated whether Grb3-3, an isoform of the Grb2 (growth factorreceptor-bound protein-2) adaptor molecule that is associated with the MAPK pathway, could be involved. We found that Grb3-3, but not its isoform Grb2, is markedly up-regulated in CD4+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from either in vitro HIV-1-infected cultures or HIV-1-infected human subjects. Analysis of HIV-1 gene products indicated that Tat and Nef, both of which have been implicated in modulating T-cell function, can independently induce expression of Grb3-3. By using NFAT/AP-1, AP-1, or NFAT reporter assays, we found that Grb3-3 can potentiate NFAT (but not AP-1) promoter activity in Jurkat T-cells upon engagement of the T-cell receptor and CD28 co-receptor. In addition, potentiation of NFAT by Grb3-3 is substantially suppressed by MEKK1, a kinase that may play an important role in retaining NFAT in the cytoplasm, and by cyclosporin A. Finally, we also found that Grb3-3 potentiates HIV-1 long terminal (LTR) repeat promoter activity following T-cell receptor stimulation, an effect that can be largely suppressed by cyclosporin A. Taken together, this study indicates that Grb3-3 is a cellular factor that can be up-regulated by HIV-1. In addition, Grb3-3 can also function as a positive factor for T-cell activation and, in doing so, may aid in establishing an intracellular environment that can optimally support HIV-1 replication.

For example, in tissue culture, quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cannot be infected efficiently unless prestimulated with activation agents such as phytohemagglutinin and anti-CD3 antibody, whereas treatment of latently infected cells with a variety of activation agents can markedly enhance viral particle production (1Pantaleo G.

These observations indeed point to a close relationship between viral replication and T-cell activation. T-cell activation initiates upon engagement of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR or CD3) and additional co-receptors such as CD28 by extracellular molecules presented by antigen-presenting cells (7Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 243: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 8Linsley P.S. Ledbetter J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 191-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 9June C.H.

Following receptor engagement, multiple intracellular signals are activated, leading to increased transcription of a variety of activation-associated genes encoding immunoresponsive cytokines (10Fraser J.D. Straus D. Weiss A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 357-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Rao A. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 10: 495-519PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ullman K.S.

Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that transcription of these cytokine genes can be drastically inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 because these drugs suppress the functional activity of calcineurin (14Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates NFAT (nuclear factor of activatedT-cells), thereby enabling the latter to translocate into the nucleus and to bind to the enhancer region of the cytokine gene (13Schreiber S.L.

More important, the fact that blocking nuclear import of NFAT can shut off transcription of these genes strongly indicates that NFAT is one of the essential transcription factors for activation of these cytokine genes (15Rao A.

Structural analysis indicates that Grb2 consists of an SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains and that Grb3-3 is structurally similar to Grb2, except that it has a truncated SH2 domain (deleted in exon III, amino acids 60–100 of Grb2) but retains two intact SH3 domains (30Lowenstein E.J.

By using NFAT/AP-1, AP-1, or NFAT reporter assays, we found that Grb3-3 can potentiate NFAT (but not AP-1) promoter activity in Jurkat T-cells upon engagement of the TCR and CD28 co-receptor. In addition, potentiation of NFAT by Grb3-3 is substantially suppressed by MEKK1*, a kinase that may play a critical role in opposing NFAT translocation into the nucleus (46Zhu J. Shibasaki F. Price R. Guillemot J.C. Yano T. Dotsch V. Wagner G. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and by CsA. Finally, Grb3-3 stimulates HIV LTR promoter activity upon engagement of CD3 and CD28 receptors, an effect that can also be inhibited by CsA. Our findings demonstrate that Grb3-3 is a cellular factor that is markedly up-regulated by HIV-1 infection and may act as a positive regulator for both T-cell activation and HIV-1 replication through its actions on NFATc. The patient blood samples were obtained at Rothschild Hospital (Dr. W. Rozenbaum) from seropositive persons from November 1993 to October 1994. Heparinized blood samples were collected after informed consent of HIV-1-seropositive (n = 31) and HIV-seronegative (n = 10) individuals. For 25 of the HIV-1-seropositive patients, clinical data were available. Using the Centers for Disease Control classification, the clinical disease status of the 25 patients was as follows: Group II in two cases, Group III in three cases, and Group IV in 20 cases. Twenty-three patients were under treatment at the time of the study; however, because of the years that these samples were obtained, none of these patients were receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapies. Six patients were seropositive for HIV p24 antigen. The HIV-1-seronegative individuals were laboratory personnel.

Hybridoma 3B5 recovered from the GST-Grb3-3-immunized mice bound Grb2 and Grb3-3 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation, whereas hybridoma 4F2 recovered from the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled 13-mer-immunized mice bound specifically to Grb3-3 alone in all three assays. Western blot assays were performed as follows. Equal amounts of whole cellular proteins were fractionated on SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by transferring the samples to a nitrocellulose filter. mAb 3B5 against Grb2/Grb3-3 was used as the primary antibody. Finally, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was added for a further incubation of 1 h at room temperature. The results were analyzed using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit. Detection of HIV-1 viral proteins in cells transfected with various expression vectors was also performed in Western blot assays as described above. Human sera from HIV-1-positive individuals were used to detect envelope protein. Rabbit anti-Rev antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Alan Cochrane (University of Toronto). Anti-Tat antibody was a gift from Dr. Bryan Cullen (Duke University). Anti-Nef antibody was obtained from Dr. Ron Swanstrom (University of North Carolina).

Constitutively activated MEKK1* (the C-terminal catalytic domain of MEKK1-(301–672)) was kindly provided by Dr. Jacques Pousségur (UMR 6543, CNRS, Université de Nice, Nice, France). It was cloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic vector (49Pomerance M. Multon M.-C. Parker F. Venot C. Blondeau J.-P. Tocqué B. Scheweighoffer F. J. Biol.

Jurkat cells (5 × 106) were transfected with DNA constructs using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as transfection mediator following the manufacturer's instruction. Typically, in each transfection, 2 μg of luciferase reporter and 4 μg of DNA constructs expressing exogenous proteins were used (see “Results”). In all transfection experiments, 1 μg of the β-galactosidase expression vector pcDNA-LacZ (Invitrogen) was cotransfected, and triplicate transfections were used to standardize transfection efficiency. Empty vectors were used to bring the total amount of DNA to 10 μg. Twenty-fours hours after transfection, the cells were activated for 5–8 h with various stimuli. Usually, PMA (Sigma) and ionomycin (Calbiochem) were used at 10 nm and 0.5 μm, respectively. Mouse monoclonal antibody against Sp1 (sc-420) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against CD3 and CD28 were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and used at 1 μg/ml. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Sigma and used at 2 μg/ml to cross-link anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies 2 h before luciferase assays (Promega kit) were performed. Data are represented as -fold increase in luciferase activity compared with the empty vector control. For detection of NFATc in the nucleus, we carried out nuclear protein extraction essentially as described (50Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree J.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total nuclear extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal antibody against NFATc (sc-7294, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As an internal control, transcription factor Sp1 was also probed using anti-Sp1 antibody (sc-420) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Several lines of evidences prompted us to investigate possible relationships between Grb3-3 and HIV-1 infection.

We initiated our studies by analyzing Grb3-3 expression in CD4+ PBMCs following HIV-1 infection. CD4+ PBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (1 μg/ml) for 3 days and subsequently infected with HIV-1 (strain NL4-3, 5 ng of p24/107 cells) (51Li X. Liang C. Quan Y. Chandok R. Laughrea M. Parniak M.A. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6003-6010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, productive infection by HIV-1 was observed in CD4+ cells, with a peak of virus production ∼1 week after infection (Fig.1 A). We next analyzed Grb3-3 protein expression in these same cultures by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Grb3-3 was not detected, and there was little change in Grb2 in uninfected cells during the entire 9-day culture period. Infection of CD4+ PBMCs with HIV-1 caused an ∼2-fold increase in Grb2 levels; however, in striking contrast, there was a steady increase in the level of Grb3-3 (Fig. 1 C), and densitometry scanning of these protein bands revealed an 80-fold increase in Grb3-3 expression levels as compared with only a 2-fold increase in Grb2 expression levels in a 9-day infection period (Fig.1 D). Similar results were obtained in Jurkat T-cells infected with HIV-1 (data not shown). These results indicate that Grb3-3 is up-regulated by HIV-1 infection in vitro.Figure 3Grb3-3 potentiates NFAT activation upon engagement of the TCR and CD28 co-receptor.

G21 is located within internal loop B; it is proposed to form a sheared base pair with A43 across loop B and to bind a Mg2+ ion.

We took advantage of its presence in the hairpin ribozyme to study its functional role. Pseudorevertants, in which the loss of G21 was compensated by mutations at other positions, were isolated by in vitro selection. The vast majority of G21 revertants contained substitutions within domain A, pointing to functional communication between specific sites within the two domains of the hairpin ribozyme. The possibility of a direct or redundant contacts is supported by electrophoretic mobility shift studies showing that a complex formed between domain B of the ribozyme and the substrate was disrupted and restored by base substitutions that have analogous effects on catalytic activity.

However, recent evidence indicates that divalent metal ions function to facilitate ribozyme folding but do not play a direct obligatory role in catalysis for the hairpin, hammerhead, and VS ribozymes (9Hampel A.

For each of these three ribozymes, it appears that catalytic function is resident in the folded structure of the RNA itself.The 21-kDa complex between the 50-nucleotide hairpin ribozyme and its 14-nucleotide substrate consists of four short helical elements and two internal loops (Fig. 1). The complex is organized into two domains. Domain A consists of the substrate and substrate-binding sequence, forming helix 1, internal loop A, and helix 2. Domain B is located entirely within the ribozyme and consists of helix 3, internal loop B, and helix 4. The two domains of the ribozyme-substrate complex interact through tertiary contacts to generate a complex necessary for catalytic activity. This was initially established through linker insertion studies (13Feldstein P.A. Bruening G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1991-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Komatsu Y. Kanzaki I.

Ultraviolet irradiation at low intensities induces a specific photo-cross-link between G21 and U42 (20Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the cross-linked RNA has little or no catalytic activity (20Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the cross-linkable conformation is likely to represent a ground state structure of the active ribozyme species, because 1) 90% cross-linking can be achieved with molecules that fold homogeneously and 2) domain B modifications that increase cross-linking yield concomitantly increased catalytic activity (21Sargueil B.

Within this motif, a local reversal of strand direction results in cross-strand stacking of the two cross-linkable bases. In the context of the hairpin ribozyme, G21 forms a sheared base pair with A43 and stacks on U42 (Fig.2). A remarkable feature of this structure is that both the major and minor grooves are wide, and the Watson-Crick base pairing faces of some of the bases are left unpaired and are projected into the grooves. This structural model has recently been confirmed by the NMR-derived structure of the isolated loop B (22Butcher S.E. Allain F.H. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this motif is well suited for specific binding of protein or RNA species (25Wimberly B. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Particularly noteworthy is the observation that N-7, N-1, and N-2 of G21 are protected from chemical modification upon Mg2+ addition (22Butcher S.E. Allain F.H. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This could be related to the recent finding that a Mn2+ ion can bind in between A20 and G21 (26Butcher S.E. Allain F.H. Feigon J.

Several biochemical and biophysical strategies have been used successfully to probe the tertiary structure of small ribozymes. Recently, an interaction between the nucleotide G+1 of the substrate and C25 has been biochemically identified (27Pinard R. Lambert D. Walter N.G. Heckman J.E. Major F. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16035-16039Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Here, we describe a fundamentally different strategy, based on a classical genetic approach, to search for functional interactions between the two domains of the hairpin ribozyme. The method is in vitro selection of pseudorevertants of loss of function mutations. In genetically tractable biological systems, the selection and analysis of second site revertants has been widely applied to examine functional interactions between molecules and within different parts of the same molecules. Advantages of the in vitro adaptation of this strategy to RNA structure are, first, that the investigator has complete control over the location, distribution, and frequency of mutations and, second, that the selection can be performed with very many more variants than can be accommodated in an in vivoselection. Our results clearly demonstrate functional compensation between specific sites within the two domains of the hairpin ribozyme. A detailed study allowed us to assess the function of the G·A sheared base pair and to understand the role of one of the magnesium ions required for activity. Four natural small catalytic RNA motifs are known to mediate cleavage and ligation, reactions central to RNA processing events associated with replication of the genomes of certain RNA viruses or virus-like RNA replicons. These include the hairpin (1Walter N.G. Burke J.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Fedor M.J. J. Mol.

However, recent evidence indicates that divalent metal ions function to facilitate ribozyme folding but do not play a direct obligatory role in catalysis for the hairpin, hammerhead, and VS ribozymes (9Hampel A. Cowan J.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 513-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 10Murray J.B. Seyhan A.A. Walter N.G. Burke J.M. Scott W.G. Chem.

For each of these three ribozymes, it appears that catalytic function is resident in the folded structure of the RNA itself. The 21-kDa complex between the 50-nucleotide hairpin ribozyme and its 14-nucleotide substrate consists of four short helical elements and two internal loops (Fig. 1). The complex is organized into two domains. Domain A consists of the substrate and substrate-binding sequence, forming helix 1, internal loop A, and helix 2. Domain B is located entirely within the ribozyme and consists of helix 3, internal loop B, and helix 4. The two domains of the ribozyme-substrate complex interact through tertiary contacts to generate a complex necessary for catalytic activity. This was initially established through linker insertion studies (13Feldstein P.A. Bruening G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1991-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Komatsu Y. Kanzaki I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29648-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Covalent cross-linking studies were used to develop a preliminary tertiary structure model for the ribozyme-substrate complex (16Earnshaw D.J. Masquida B. Muller S. Sigurdsson S.T. Eckstein F. Westhof E. Gait M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Subsequently, fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis (17Murchie A.I. Thomson J.B. Walter F. Lilley D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 873-881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Walter N.G. Hampel K.J. Brown K.M. Burke J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and hydroxyl radical protection experiments (19Hampel K.J. Walter N.G. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14672-14682Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were used to establish the requirements for docking of the two domains and to map the interface between the domains in the docked complex. Cleavage properties of ribozymes with the wild type base (G) and all variants were examined. Initial cleavage rates were measured under conditions of substrate excess (20 nm ribozyme and 200 nm substrate; see “Materials and Methods”) in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with the indicated MgCl2 concentration and were normalized to the wild type rate (see “Materials and Methods”). G21 is located at a particularly interesting location within the hairpin ribozyme. Ultraviolet irradiation at low intensities induces a specific photo-cross-link between G21 and U42 (20Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the cross-linked RNA has little or no catalytic activity (20Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the cross-linkable conformation is likely to represent a ground state structure of the active ribozyme species, because 1) 90% cross-linking can be achieved with molecules that fold homogeneously and 2) domain B modifications that increase cross-linking yield concomitantly increased catalytic activity (21Sargueil B. Pecchia D.B. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7739-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 1B. Sargueil, S. Butcher, and J. Burke, unpublished results.1B. Sargueil, S. Butcher, and J. Burke, unpublished results. The region of loop B in which G21 is embedded represents a common folding motif, also found within loop E of eukaryotic 5 S rRNA, the conserved central domain of viroids, and the sarcin-ricin loop of large rRNA (20Butcher S.E. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,22Butcher S.E. Allain F.H. Feigon J. Nat. Struct.

Within this motif, a local reversal of strand direction results in cross-strand stacking of the two cross-linkable bases. In the context of the hairpin ribozyme, G21 forms a sheared base pair with A43 and stacks on U42 (Fig.2). A remarkable feature of this structure is that both the major and minor grooves are wide, and the Watson-Crick base pairing faces of some of the bases are left unpaired and are projected into the grooves. This structural model has recently been confirmed by the NMR-derived structure of the isolated loop B (22Butcher S.E. Allain F.H. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this motif is well suited for specific binding of protein or RNA species (25Wimberly B. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Particularly noteworthy is the observation that N-7, N-1, and N-2 of G21 are protected from chemical modification upon Mg2+ addition (22Butcher S.E. Allain F.H. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This could be related to the recent finding that a Mn2+ ion can bind in between A20 and G21 (26Butcher S.E. Allain F.H. Feigon J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The identification of specific tertiary contacts between the two domains presents a very challenging problem. Several biochemical and biophysical strategies have been used successfully to probe the tertiary structure of small ribozymes. Recently, an interaction between the nucleotide G+1 of the substrate and C25 has been biochemically identified (27Pinard R. Lambert D. Walter N.G. Heckman J.E. Major F. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16035-16039Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a fundamentally different strategy, based on a classical genetic approach, to search for functional interactions between the two domains of the hairpin ribozyme. The method is in vitro selection of pseudorevertants of loss of function mutations. In genetically tractable biological systems, the selection and analysis of second site revertants has been widely applied to examine functional interactions between molecules and within different parts of the same molecules. Advantages of the in vitro adaptation of this strategy to RNA structure are, first, that the investigator has complete control over the location, distribution, and frequency of mutations and, second, that the selection can be performed with very many more variants than can be accommodated in an in vivoselection. Our results clearly demonstrate functional compensation between specific sites within the two domains of the hairpin ribozyme. A detailed study allowed us to assess the function of the G·A sheared base pair and to understand the role of one of the magnesium ions required for activity.

https://openalex.org/W2071185005,"The gene 32 protein (gp32) of bacteriophage T4 is the essential single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein required for phage DNA replication and recombination. gp32 binds ssDNA with high affinity and cooperativity, forming contiguous clusters that optimally configure the ssDNA for recognition by DNA polymerase or recombination enzymes. The precise roles of gp32 affinity and cooperativity in promoting replication and recombination have yet to be defined, however. Previous work established that the N-terminal “B-domain” of gp32 is essential for cooperativity and that point mutations at Arg4 and Lys3 positions have varying and dramatic effects on gp32-ssDNA interactions. Therefore, we examined the effects of six different gp32 B-domain mutants on T4 in vitro systems for DNA synthesis and homologous pairing. We find that the B-domain is essential for gp32's stimulation of these reactions. The stimulatory efficacy of gp32 B-domain mutants generally correlates with the hierarchy of relative ssDNA binding affinities,i.e. wild-type gp32 ≈ R4K > K3A ≈ R4Q > R4T > R4G ≫ gp32-B. However, the functional defect of a particular mutant is often greater than can be explained simply by its ability to saturate the ssDNA at equilibrium, suggesting additional defects in the proper assembly and activity of DNA polymerase and recombinase complexes on ssDNA, which may derive from a decreased lifetime of gp32-ssDNA clusters.

Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The interactions of gp32 with polynucleotides are characterized by its pronounced preference for single-strandedversus double-stranded DNA and by the high cooperativity of gp32-ssDNA interactions. The high cooperativity of binding by monomeric gp32 results in the formation of protein clusters on regions of ssDNA that form transiently during DNA replication, recombination, and repair. In addition to protecting ssDNA from intracellular nucleases, cooperative binding by gp32 appears to be a prerequisite for removing ssDNA secondary structure and for inducing other DNA structural changes necessary for optimal recognition of the ssDNA by T4 enzymes, including DNA polymerase (gp43), and for stimulating homologous recombination by binding to the displaced strand during DNA strand exchange (1Chase J.W.

Native gp32 consists of a single polypeptide chain of 301 amino acid residues (34 kDa). Early studies revealed that the protein contains three distinct structural and functional domains, which map to specific regions of the primary structure of gp32 (4Williams K.R. Shamoo Y. Spicer E.K. Coleman J.E. Konigsberg W.H. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 301-304Google Scholar). The ssDNA binding core domain spans residues 22–253, and contains an intrinsic Zn(II) ion (5Giedroc D.P. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8452-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The structure of the core domain co-crystallized with oligo(dT)6 has been determined to 2.2-Å resolution (6Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Appended to the core domain at its N and C termini are the so-called “B” or basic domain (residues 1–21), and the “A” or acidic domain (residues 254–301), respectively, neither of which has been characterized structurally. The A-domain is known to be important for heterologous protein-protein interactions with several T4 DNA replication and recombination proteins, including gp43 (DNA polymerase), gp61 (primase), UvsX (general recombinase), the recombination mediator protein UvsY, the primosome assembly factor gp59, and the nonessential DNA helicase Dda (7Hurley J.M.

Characterization of gp32-B (gp32 residues 22–301), a truncated form of gp32 lacking the N-terminal B-domain, reveals that this protein binds noncooperatively to ssDNA and also fails to exhibit self-association in solution (10Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with a model in which major stabilization of the interactions between contiguously ssDNA-bound gp32 molecules occurs via the B-domain. A more recent characterization of gp32 species that contain specific amino acid substitutions within the B-domain has revealed unexpected complexity in this simple model, while identifying some of the residues required for high affinity, cooperative binding to single-stranded polynucleotides (11Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14395-14404Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Of central importance is Arg4, the positive charge of which appears necessary both for the cooperativity of gp32-ssDNA binding and for the helix-destabilizing activity of gp32 (11Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Four gp32 species containing different amino acid substitutions at this position (the R4K, R4Q, R4T, and R4G derivatives) have been shown to vary widely in their intrinsic affinity and cooperativity of binding to model single-stranded polynucleotides (11Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, K3A gp32 has also been characterized (12Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27623-27629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), as has the truncated species gp32-B (10Giedroc D.P. Khan R. Barnhart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11444-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experimentally determined binding parameters for each of these gp32 species to a poly(A) lattice are listed in Table I, which shows that the apparent binding constant (K app) value decreases according to the following hierarchy: wild-type gp32 ≈ R4K > K3A ≈ R4Q > R4T > R4G ≫ gp32-B (10Giedroc D.P.

Surprisingly, both the cooperativity (ω) and intrinsic affinity (K int) constants appear to be adversely affected by nonconservative substitution of Lys3 and Arg4, with primary perturbations inK int (Table I), suggesting that these mutations affect gp32-ssDNA stability globally (11Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11235-11246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27623-27629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, mechanistic studies reveal that virtually all of the perturbation in equilibrium affinity originates with an enhanced rate at which cooperatively bound mutant gp32 monomers dissociate from the ends of protein clusters (13Villemain J.L. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14395-14404Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These studies reveal that the N-terminal B-domain plays a critical role in modulating the lifetime of cooperatively bound gp32-polynucleotide complexes.Figure 3The binding of wild-type and B-domain mutant gp32 species to the recombination substrate M13mp19 ssDNA as demonstrated by gel mobility assay.

A thorough understanding of the functional ramifications of B-domain mutations requires an assessment of their effects on the DNA replication and recombination processes in which gp32 participates. Under defined conditions in vitro, homologous pairing reactions catalyzed by the T4 UvsX recombinase require gp32 as a nearly essential cofactor and are highly sensitive to gp32 concentration (3Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20966-20969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, there are several in vitro DNA synthesis reactions catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme (gp43 polymerase plus accessory proteins gp44/62 and gp45) that absolutely depend on the presence of gp32. One of these is strand displacement synthesis on a nicked duplex template, which, in the absence of the gp41 DNA helicase, requires gp32 in approximately stoichiometric amounts with respect to the DNA and in large excess over other components of the T4 replication fork (14Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12220-12225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). gp32 is also required for DNA synthesis past a stable hairpin in a single-stranded DNA template (15Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the strong dependence of each of these three in vitroreactions on gp32 concentration, they offer an unparalleled opportunity to correlate well defined physicochemical defects in mutant gp32-ssDNA complexes with defects in the nonequilibrium processes of DNA replication and recombination. Accordingly, we have studied the extent to which each of the six gp32 B-domain mutants previously characterized stimulate homologous pairing, strand displacement DNA synthesis, and trans-hairpin DNA synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the B-domain of gp32 is essential for the stimulatory effects of gp32 on these in vitro reactions. Specific reductions in recombination and replication functional efficacy exhibited by individual mutants correlate, to a first approximation, with their relative affinities for ssDNA at equilibrium. However, some mutants are more defective in replication and recombination assays than would be predicted simply on the basis of their ability or inability to saturate ssDNA. Instead, the data suggest that these mutations give rise to gp32-ssDNA complexes that are kinetically compromised in their functional stability and/or defective in establishing important interactions between gp32 and the DNA polymerase and recombinase enzymes.

The concentrations of gp32 wild-type and B-domain mutant species were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 4.13 × 104m−1 cm−1determined from the amino acid sequence (18Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The concentrations of other T4 protein stock solutions were determined by a spectrophotometric Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin standards. All purified protein stocks were tested for contaminating endo- or exonuclease activities by incubating protein (at reaction concentrations) with circular plus linear ssDNA, supercoiled plus nicked circular dsDNA, or linear dsDNA samples as appropriate and then examining the DNA on agarose gels. All protein stocks used in these studies were nuclease-free according to these criteria. Supercoiled RFI DNA from bacteriophage M13mp19 was isolated as described (19Miller H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 145-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Linearized RFIII dsDNA was produced by treating RFI with the SmaI restriction enzyme and then 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP via the T4 DNA polymerase reaction (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nicked RFII DNA was generated by treating M13mp19 RFI DNA with the bacteriophage fd gene 2 protein as described (21Dotto G.D. Enea V. Zinder N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oligonucleotide primers used for trans-hairpin DNA replication experiments and controls on primed templates were purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc. Primer molecules were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All DNA concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm using conversion factors of 50 μg/ml/A 260for dsDNA and 36 μg/ml/A 260 for ssDNA and are expressed as μmol of nucleotide residues/liter except as noted. UvsX-catalyzed homologous pairing reactions were carried out essentially as described previously (23Qiu H. Kodadek T. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2773-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Kodadek T. Wong M.L. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9427-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombination buffer contained final concentrations of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 90 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, 10 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Each 40-μl reaction mixture contained 1 μm (40 μg/ml) UvsX protein, 9.2 μm (3 μg/ml) 3′-32P-labeled M13mp19 RFIII DNA, 15.4 μm (5 μg/ml) M13mp19 ssDNA circles, and concentrations of gp32 wild-type or mutant species as indicated. Each reaction mixture was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and then 2 mm ATP (final concentration) was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was quenched after 15 min by the addition of a quench buffer to bring the final solution concentrations of EDTA and SDS to 20 mm and 0.5%, respectively. The samples were then electrophoresed on a 0.5% agarose gel in TBE buffer (89 mmTris base, 89 mm boric acid, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA). The recombination products were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Homologous pairing experiments performed to study the time dependence of the pairing reaction were carried out similarly at a constant protein concentration (3 μm) of wild-type or R4Q gp32. For each reaction, all constituents except ATP were combined, followed by preincubation for 10 min at 37 °C before an aliquot corresponding to time 0 was withdrawn. 2 mm ATP was then added to initiate the reaction, and aliquots were withdrawn at the times indicated and quenched with 20 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS. Protein-ssDNA complexes were formed by incubating 15.4 μm (nucleotides) M13mp19 ssDNA with an indicated concentration of wild-type or mutant gp32 for 10 min at 37 °C in 40 μl (final volume) of recombination buffer. 5 μl of gel loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue) was added to each sample; samples were then electrophoresed on a 0.5% agarose gel in low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.4 mm sodium acetate, and 0.2 mmNa3EDTA) at a constant voltage of 7 V/cm with continuous buffer recirculation (25Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The protein-ssDNA complexes contained in the gel were dissociated by soaking the gel for 1–2 h in high salt buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1 mmNa3EDTA, 1 m NaCl) in the presence of Sybergreen II RNA gel stain, which was found to stain ssDNA more efficiently than ethidium bromide under these conditions. Normalized relative mobility values were calculated from the data by dividing the relative mobility of a protein-ssDNA complex band by the relative mobility of the saturated ssDNA-wild-type gp32 complex. The relative mobility was measured as the distance of migration of a protein-ssDNA complex from the middle of the free ssDNA band to the middle of the most intense region of the protein-ssDNA complex band. Strand displacement DNA synthesis reactions were carried out at 37 °C in reaction volumes of 25 μl. Reaction mixtures contained the following components (final concentrations): 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 80 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, 2 mm each of ATP and GTP, 100 μm each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP (specific activity = 3000 Ci/mmol), and 10 μm (nucleotides) M13mp19 RFII DNA, plus T4 proteins (4 μg/ml gp43, 24 μg/ml gp44/62, 8 μg/ml gp45, and variable amounts of wild-type or mutant gp32 species as indicated in the figure legends). For each reaction, all reaction components except DNA, dNTPs, and [α-32P]dTTP were preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C, and then the reaction was initiated by the addition of the missing components. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min, at which time they were stopped by the addition of 1.5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA to each tube (yielding a final EDTA concentration of 28 mm) and transferred to an ice-water bath. The DNA synthesis that occurred in each sample was evaluated quantitatively by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and/or qualitatively by electrophoresis on 0.8% alkaline agarose gels. For trichloroacetic acid precipitation, 15 μl of each stopped reaction sample was spotted onto a Whatman GF/A glass filter; these were soaked for 15 min in 250 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, 10% saturated sodium pyrophosphate solution at 4 °C and then washed successively with 4 × 250 ml of cold 1 m HCl and 2 × 250 ml of cold 95% ethanol, dried under a heat lamp, and transferred to a scintillation counter. For alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis, the remainder of each sample (11.5 μl) was brought to final concentrations of 10% sucrose, 30 mm NaOH, and 0.04% bromcresol green, respectively, by adding 3.5 μl of a 4× concentrated solution of these gel loading buffer components. Samples were loaded onto a horizontal 0.8% alkaline agarose gel, which was prepared and run as described (26Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were neutralized by soaking for 30 min in TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and then stained in TBE containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Stained gels were photographed on a UV light box to record marker positions and then dried under vacuum onto Whatman DE81 DEAE-cellulose paper. Dried gels were autoradiographed at −70 °C using Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. Primer 1 is a 5′-32P-labeled 20-mer of sequence 5′-CGATTAAGTTGGGTAACGCC-3′, which anneals to the M13mp4 ssDNA template with its 3′-end 40 bases upstream of the stable 15-base pair hairpin described by Hacker and Alberts (15Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primer 2 is a 5′-32P-labeled 20-mer of sequence 5′-TCCGCTCACAATTCCACACA-3′, which anneals to M13mp4 ssDNA with its 3′-end 60 bases downstream of the hairpin. Annealing conditions were as follows: 0.2 pmol (molecules) of either primer 1 or 2, depending on the experiment, or control was mixed with 0.2 pmol (molecules) of M13mp4 ssDNA circles in 20 μl of annealing buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 80 mm potassium acetate, 10 mmmagnesium acetate). The mixture was heated to 75 °C for 4 min and then slowly cooled to 25 °C, forming a concentrated stock solution of 75 μm (nucleotides) annealed primer-template. Replication reactions were carried out at 25 °C, in reaction volumes of 15 μl. Reaction mixtures contained (final concentrations) 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 80 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μm(nucleotides) annealed primer-template, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 0.04 μg/ml gp43, 24 μg/ml gp44/62, 8 μg/ml gp45, and variable amounts of wild-type or mutant gp32 species as indicated in the figure legends. Reaction mixtures containing all components except primer-template were preincubated for 2 min at 25 °C, and then reactions were initiated by the addition of primer-template. Reactions at 25 °C were stopped after 1 min by the addition of EDTA to 30 mm final concentration and transferred to an ice bath. Samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted once to remove protein, passed through a Sephadex spin cartridge to remove salt, dried in a speed-vac, dissolved in 5 μl of sequencing gel loading buffer (98% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue), boiled for 4 min, and then rapidly transferred to an ice-water bath. Samples were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide/urea denaturing gel and electrophoresed at 500 V. The gel was dried and autoradiographed as described above. The efficiency of each B-domain mutant to stimulate the homologous pairing reaction catalyzed by UvsX protein was monitored by observing the conversion of 32P-labeled linear dsDNA (RFIII) into high molecular weight aggregates as evidenced by agarose gel electrophoresis (24Kodadek T. Wong M.L. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9427-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since UvsX protein alone can catalyze this reaction at saturating concentrations, care was taken in choosing the conditions of the experiment so that pairing would be co-dependent on UvsX and gp32. These conditions, identified previously (23Qiu H. Kodadek T. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2773-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), require 1 μm UvsX protein, along with 9.2 μm linear duplex and 15.4 μm ssDNA circles in each reaction with an indicated amount of gp32. When reactions are performed under these conditions in the presence of wild-type gp32, autoradiography of the deproteinized samples reveals a gp32 concentration-dependent disappearance of the labeled duplex with the simultaneous appearance of a diffuse, slower migrating band (Fig. 1 A). This diffuse or smeared band is subsequently converted into a band consisting of high molecular weight aggregates that do not enter the gel (Fig.1 A). The proficiency with which each gp32 derivative assists in this reaction provides an indication of its relative ability to function as an accessory protein in recombination events. For ease of comparison between wild-type and mutant gp32 species, homologous pairing at th"

We show that a 430-amino acid-long fragment containing β conserved segments F, G, H, and a short part of segment I forms a minimal domain capable of specific interaction with α. The α-interacting domain is held together by protein-protein interactions between β segments F and I. Residues in catalytically important β segments H and I directly participate in α binding; substitutions of strictly conserved segment H Asp1084 and segment I Gly1215 abolish α2β formation in vitro and are lethal in vivo. The importance of these β amino acids in α binding is fully supported by the structural model of the Thermus aquaticus RNAP core enzyme. We also demonstrate that determinants of RNAP assembly are conserved, and that a homologue of β Asp1084 in A135, the β-like subunit of yeast RNAP I, is responsible for interaction with AC40, the largest α-like subunit. However, the A135-AC40 interaction is weak compared with the E. coli α-β interaction, and A135mutation that abolishes the interaction is phenotypically silent. The results suggest that in eukaryotes additional RNAP subunits orchestrate the enzyme assembly by stabilizing weak, but specific interactions of core subunits.

RNA polymerase polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nitrilotriacetic acid rifampicin N-terminal domain GAL4 DNA binding domain GAL4 activation domain Cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs)1 are large, multisubunit enzymes. A typical prokaryotic RNAP core contains 5 polypeptides with a total molecular mass of ∼400 kDa. Core RNAP from eukaryotes and archaea contain 10–14 subunits with a total molecular mass in excess of 500 kDa. Sequence alignments of RNAP subunits reveal extensive similarities; each of the two largest RNAP subunits, which are the most evolutionarily conserved, contains 8–9 colinear segments with many invariant amino acids (1Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 2Sweetser D. Nonet M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). RNAPs from different sources are also homologous structurally; low resolution (16–35 Å) three-dimensional models of Escherichia coli, and RNAP II and RNAP I from yeast obtained by means of electron crystallography reveal significant similarities (3Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 365-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 4Darst S.A. Edwards A.M. Kubalek E.W. Kornberg R.D.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2601-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Evolutionarily conserved subunit segments probably form distinct functional domains common to all RNAPs. Genetic data support this notion; mutational changes of conserved residues selectively destroy distinct partial functions of the enzyme (e.g. the transition from abortive initiation to productive elongation (Ref. 6Kashlev M. Lee J. Zalenskaya K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1990; 248: 1006-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or phosphodiester bond synthesis (Ref. 7Zaychikov E. Martin E. Denissova L. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Kashlev M. Heumann H. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mustaev A. Science. 1996; 273: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)), but leave other functions unperturbed. However, isolated subunits themselves do not possess any of the partial functions of the whole enzyme (8Zillig W. Palm P. Heil A. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 101-125Google Scholar). Therefore, RNAP functional sites are either formed allosterically upon the enzyme assembly, or are located at subunit interfaces. Thus, understanding inter- and intrasubunit interactions should provide insights in RNAP mechanism and regulation. E. coli RNAP assembles in vivo and in vitro according to the following scheme: α-α2-α2β-α2ββ′ (9Ishihama A. Adv. Biophys. 1981; 14: 1-35PubMed Google Scholar). The α2β assembly intermediate appears to be evolutionary conserved, and an α2β-like RNAP II subassembly was isolated from yeasts (10Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4669-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Kimura M. Ishiguro A. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25851-25855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Further, mutations inE. coli α, and in its yeast RNAP II counterpart, Rpb3, that affect the α2β formation in their respective systems occur in homologous positions (12Igarashi K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5945-5948Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Azuma Y. Yamagishi M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3749-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The β and β′ homologues are naturally fragmented in some archaea and cyanobacteria (14Pühler G. Leffers H. Gropp F.

J Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly pathway should be more complex in organisms with split β, β′ homologues, but this has not been investigated. Our own work with E. coli defined four separable domains in β and three in β′ (16Severinov K. Mustaev A. Severinova E. Bass I. Landick R. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Severinov K. Mustaev A. Kukarin A. Muzzin O. Bass A. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27969-27974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), that correspond to natural fragmentation sites in some of the archaea and cyanobacteria. The ability to generate functional E. coli RNAP using subunit domains greatly aided the study of RNAP assembly and biochemical functions of assembly intermediates. A combination of fragmented RNAP reconstitution, limited proteolysis, and protein-protein co-immobilization assays was used to demonstrate that determinants of specific α binding reside in the C-terminal assembly-competent structural module of β, containing amino acids 907–1342 (conserved segments H and I; Ref. 18Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyö D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, similar analysis performed by the Ishihama group (19Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggested that the primary determinants of α binding include conserved segments F and G, corresponding to E. coli β amino acids 800–900. The discrepancy between the two sets of data illustrates problems associated with in vitro coimmobilization assays, which can be artifact-prone. Thus, alternative approaches are needed to characterize the α-β interaction in molecular detail. Here, we used the method of yeast two-hybrid analysis to analyze the interaction of the α and β subunits during α2β formation. Our results support the conclusion of Wang et al. (18Wang Y.

Site-specific PCR mutagenesis and standard recloning steps were used to introduce point mutations in yeast two-hybrid of E. coliexpression plasmids. Full-length β and β′ used in in vitro RNAP assembly studies were obtained from expression plasmids pMKSe2 and pT7β′ (23Zalenskaya K. Lee J. Gujuluva C.N. Shin Y.K. Slutsky M. Goldfarb A.

Yeast were transformed using standard lithium acetate procedure, and transformants were selected on appropriate drop-out media. For two-hybrid assay, we used the LNY 327 tester strain provided by L. Neigeborn. This strain is identical to the PCY2 strain of Chevrai and Nathans (20Chevrai P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The interaction between two-hybrid constructs was scored using filter assays, or quantitative colorimetric assay using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside as a substrate (25Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 331-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following formula was used to calculate β-galactosidase production: β-galactosidase activity (Miller units) = 10,000 × (OD420 − 1.75 × OD550)/(OD600 × t), where OD420, OD550, and OD660 are optical density of the reaction at 420, 550, and 600 nm, respectively at timet (min) of the reaction.

Purified His6 αNTD was mixed with β or its derivatives (from washed inclusion bodies) at a molar ratio of 1:1 and a total protein concentration of not more than 0.5 mg/ml in reconstitution buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 mguanidine HCl) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 × 2 liters of the same buffer without guanidine HCl. For RNAP reconstitution, proteins were combined at a molar ratio α:β:β′ of 1:1:2. At these conditions, unassembled β′ precipitated during dialysis and was removed by low speed centifugation. Protein complexes (about 10 μg) were mixed with pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) in 50 μl of reconstitution buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 500 μl of buffer with 10 mm imidazole. The protein samples were then eluted from the beads with buffer containing 100 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 10 μl of RNAP reconstitution reaction was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μg of recombinant ς70 subunit (23Zalenskaya K. Lee J. Gujuluva C.N. Shin Y.K. Slutsky M. Goldfarb A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 89: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and 50 ng of the T7A1 promoter-containing DNA fragment (22Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14820-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 0.5 mm CpA, with or without 25 μg/ml rifampicin. Reactions were initiated by the addition of NTP (final concentration 25 μm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 1 μm [α-32P]UTP (1000 Ci/mmol). Reactions proceeded for 15 min at 37 °C, and were terminated by the addition of urea containing loading buffer. Reaction products were resolved by denaturing 20% PAGE and revealed by autoradiography. For our research, it was critical to establish that the interaction between β and the dimeric α subunit could be studied by two-hybrid approach, and that mutations that decrease this strong interaction can be detected in yeast. As an initial test, we used the N-terminal domain of α (NTD, amino acids 1–235) and the β subunit fragment containing amino acids 711–1246, which specifically interact with each other in vitro (18Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyö D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). α-NTD was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-DB) of the bait plasmid pPC97, and β711–1246 was fused to the GAL4 activation domain (Gal4-AD) of the prey plasmid pPC86 (20Chevrai P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). High levels of β-galactosidase were observed when both plasmids were present (intense blue color developed in less than 30 min in a standard filter assay; 440 Miller units of β-galactosidase activity in a quantitative liquid assay, see “Materials and Methods”); no activity was observed when either fusion plasmid was used separately, as expected (cells remained white after overnight incubation on a filter, less than 1 Miller unit of β-galactosidase activity). Importantly, when pPC97α1–235, carrying a mutation that changes α Arg45 for Ala and weakens the interaction with β (12Igarashi K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5945-5948Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was used, no activity was detected even in the presence of pPC86β711–1246 (white color, less than 1 Miller unit of β-galactosidase activity, data not shown). Thus, we can detect the α-β interaction and amino acid changes that affect this interaction using the two-hybrid system. This result sets the stage for more detailed analyses of RNAP assembly described below. Our starting β two-hybrid construct, pPC86β711–1246, contained 535 rpoB codons and corresponded exactly to the smallest β fragment that specifically interacted with α in vitro (18Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyö D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The β711–1246 fragment spans four universally conserved β segments, F, G, H, and part of I. To determine the smallest β fragment capable of interacting with α, we engineered pPC86β711–1246 derivatives with deletions at either the beginning or the end of the β moiety, and tested these new plasmids for their ability to elicit β-galactosidase production in yeast cells harboring pPC97α1–235. The results are schematically presented in Fig. 1. As can be seen, β800–1246 hybrid interacted with the α hybrid. However, further deletion in segment F, β812–1246, abolished the interaction. At the C-terminal side, removal of β amino acids 1231–1246 had no effect on interaction with α. However, the removal of additional 6 β amino acids (1226–1231) abolished the interaction. The results suggest that β amino acids 711–800, which contain 80 non-conserved amino acids, and 10 amino acids from conserved segment F, and β amino acids 1231–1246, which contain most of β conserved segment I, including residue His1237, which forms the 5′-face of the catalytic center (27Mustaev A. Kashlev M. Lee J. Polyakov A. Lebedev A. Zalenskaya K. Grachev M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23927-23931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are not necessary for specific interaction with α. We note, however, that these regions of β may still contribute to the overall strength of the binding, since the two-hybrid interaction may be saturated and insensitive to minor changes in the strength of binding. The two-hybrid construct containing β amino acids 800–1231 was the smallest construct that interacted with α strongly (520 Miller units) and specifically (0.5 Miller units when used with αR45Atwo-hybrid construct) (Fig. 1). Shorter constructs, constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, β812–1231, β832–1231, and β8oo-1225, failed to interact with α hybrid (<1 Miller unit). We also attempted to further narrow the interacting domain by performing nested Bal31 deletion mutagenesis at either the 5′ or the 3′ ends of therpoB portion of pPC86β800–1231, transforming mutated plasmids in yeast cells harboring pPC97α, and selecting interacting (Lac+) colonies. The DNA sequence of several interacting β plasmids was determined, and in all cases Bal31 deletions extended into the vector part of pPC86β800–1231, while rpoB codons 800 and 1231 were retained (data not shown). We conclude that β800–1231 is the minimal β fragment capable of α binding. The minimal interacting fragment of β, β800–1231, contains dispensable region II (β amino acids 907–1050) that is missing in some bacterial β subunits and in homologues from eukaryotes and archaea (28Borukhov S. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Lebedev A. Bass I. Rowland G.C. Lim P.-P. Glass R.E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23921-23926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region tolerates an artificial split at around position 950 (16Severinov K. Mustaev A. Severinova E. Bass I. Landick R. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and is highly susceptible to trypsin attack at position 907 and 911 (28Borukhov S. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Lebedev A. Bass I. Rowland G.C. Lim P.-P. Glass R.E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23921-23926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, dispensable region II likely demarcates two structurally independent β modules. Earlier studies indicated that assembly-competent β module, β950–1342, which contains conserved segment H and I, interacted with His6-α-NTD (18Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyö D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, β950–1342binding was weak compared with the binding of the larger, β711–1342, fragment or full-sized β. Moreover, β950–1342 interacted with His6-αWT and His6-αR45A in vitro with the same (low) efficiency (18Wang Y. Severinov K. Loizos N. Fenyö D. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 648-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Nomura et al. (19Nomura T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) mapped the primary α-binding site to β amino acids 737–904. We constructed pPC86-based two-hybrid plasmids with β800–911 (conserved segments F and G), and β907–1231, (conserved segments H and a small portion of I) and tested them for their ability to interact with α. Neither pPC86β711–911 plasmid, nor pPC86β907–1231elicited β-galactosidase activity with pPC97α1–235suggesting that β segments F and G, or segment H and I, alone do not interact with α in our assay (data not shown). Our results suggest that β amino acids 801–811 and 1226–1231 in conserved regions F and I, respectively, contribute, either directly or indirectly, to the interaction with the α dimer. In the former scenario, both segment F and segment I residues interact with α to result in strong binding; neither segment binds α strongly enough for the interaction to be detected by two-hybrid assay. The latter scenario may involve an intrasubunit interaction between the two regions of β, one containing segment F and G, and another containing segments H and I. One can envision, then, that the interaction of the two β fragments results in the formation of the structure which is fully capable of α binding. Two-hybrid constructs containing β800–911 and β907–1231 strongly interacted with each other (Fig. 2). In contrast, construct containing β812–911 did not interact with β907–1231. Likewise, no interaction was detected between two-hybrid constructs containing β800–911 and β907–1225. Thus, the residues required for α binding are also required for intrasubunit interactions between two β modules, consistent with the idea that segment F and I amino acids contribute to α binding indirectly. In α, substitution of the strictly conserved Arg45 interferes with the β binding (12Igarashi K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5945-5948Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Arg45 interacts with a negatively charged, conserved amino acid in β, and that this interaction is responsible for the α2β formation. Accordingly, we inspected the E. coli β fragment between amino acids 800 and 1231 to see if such amino acids could be found. Segment G contains no conserved negatively charged amino acids; segment F contains one such residue, Glu813. This position was previously mutated to an Arg (29Lee J. Kashlev M. Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); the resulting RNAP had a catalytic defect but had no assembly defect, and therefore we did not study this position further. As can be seen from the alignment presented in Fig.3 A, segment H contains 4 negatively charged amino acids, Asp1064, Asp1084, Asp1095, and Glu1114, which are strictly conserved and thus fulfill our criteria for potential candidates involved in α binding. Residue Asp1064 was mutated previously in the course of a mutational study of the RNAP initiating site (30Sagitov V. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2195-2202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of that study revealed that β harboring the D1064A mutation was assembly-proficient, but the resulting RNAP was catalytically defective. Based on these results, position 1064 was excluded from our analysis. Segment I contains no conserved negatively charged amino acids. However, there are three Gly residues, at positions 1215, 1218, and 1228, which are strictly conserved. Previously, we had demonstrated that substitutions of evolutionarily conserved glycines for aspartic residues in the β′ subunit result in assembly defects (31Nedea E.C. Markov D. Naryshkina T. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2663-2665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to the three site-specific mutations changing two aspartates and one glutamate from segment H for alanines, we also substituted each of the three segment I glycines for aspartates. The mutations were engineered in pPC86β800–1231 background, and their effect on α binding in two hybrid system was studied. The results are shown above the alignment on Fig. 3 A. Of the six mutations tested, only two, D1084A and G1215D, completely abolished the interaction as judged by both the filter and the liquid β-galactosidase assays. G1218D showed weak, but clearly positive, interaction. The remaining mutations had no effect on α binding. To confirm the α binding defects directly, we recloned all mutations into the pMKSe2(S531F) β-overproducing plasmid (22Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14820-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit expressed from pMKSe2(S531F) contains a rifampicin (Rif) resistance mutation changing Ser531 to Phe. Therefore, Rif-sensitive host cells transformed with pMKSe2(S531F) grow on medium containing Rif. In contrast, cells transformed with pMKSe2(S531F) harboring the engineered segment H and I mutations did not form colonies in the presence of Rif, but were unaffected for growth in its absence. Thus, the rpoB mutations behaved as recessive lethals, a phenotype expected of assembly mutations. The binding defect of β mutants was also showed directly, by studying their ability to co-immobilize on Ni2+-NTA-agarose through protein-protein interactions with hexahistidine-tagged αNTD (Fig.3 B). In this experiment, the wild-type or mutant β subunits were prepared from inclusion bodies and combined with recombinant αNTD in the presence of high concentration of denaturing agent guanidine HCl. The denaturant was dialyzed away at conditions favoring RNAP assembly, and reactions were allowed to bind to Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads. The beads were washed, and the bound protein was eluted with a buffer containing high concentration of imidazole. As can be seen, the wild-type β was efficiently immobilized on the sorbent in the presence of tagged αNTD (Fig.3 B, lane 4), as expected. In contrast, most of β harboring the D1084A and G1215D substitutions was found in the flow-through (lanes 6 and 10) and did not associate with αNTD (lanes 8 and12). G1218D also caused a defect in αNTD binding, but, in agreement with the two-hybrid results, the extent of this defect was weaker than those of either D1084A or G1215D (compare lane 20 with lanes 8 and 12). Similar analysis revealed that in agreement with the two-hybrid result substitutions at positions 1095, 1114, and 1228 had no effect in the co-immobilization assay (Fig. 3 B, lane 24; and data not shown). We conclude that β positions 1084, 1215, and, to a lesser degree, 1218 are involved in α binding, and that the lethal in vivo phenotypes exhibited by therpoB genes harboring substitutions in these positions are likely explained by the defect in the α2β formation. In contrast, the lethal phenotype caused by substitutions atrpoB positions 1095, 1114, and 1228 must be due to alterations of some other essential RNAP function(s). In principle, two classes of mutations can abolish protein-protein interaction. The mutations of the first class distort the native structure, perhaps through an allosteric mechanism, and thus prevent the interaction. The second, most interesting class, is true interaction mutations, which affect favorable interactions that bring the two proteins together. We investigated the ability of the β subunit harboring the D1084A and G1215D mutations to assemble into active RNAP in vitro in the presence of the wild-type β′ and hexahistidine-tagged αNTD. The assembly reactions were examined by Ni2+-NTA coimmobilization (Fig. 3 C). The addition of β′ corrected the αNTD-binding defect caused by the D1084A mutation, and RNAP core enzyme was formed in good yield (Fig.3 C, lane 8). A steady-state in vitro transcription experiment revealed transcription activity in the RNAP assembly reactions containing β with D1084A substitution (Fig. 3 D, lane 3). This transcription was rifampicin-resistant (lane 4), proving that the activity was due to the mutant RNAP, which also carries the S531F Rif resistance mutation, and not due to contaminating wild-type RNAP from the host, which is rifampicin-sensitive (see lanes 5 and 6). This result implies that the D1084A mutation does not grossly distort β structure and may be directly involved in interactions with α. In contrast, no assembled RNAP was detected in the in vitro RNAP assembly reaction containing His-tagged α, β′, and β carrying the G1215D mutation (Fig.3 C, lane 12), and there was no transcription activity in G1215D assembly reactions (Fig.3 D, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, Gly1215 appears to play a structural role, and its involvement in α binding may be indirect. In yeast, two α-like subunits, AC40 and AC19, form a heterodimer that is functionally equivalent to the α2homodimer in prokaryotes (32Lalo D. Carles C. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5524-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)"
https://openalex.org/W2066687916,"Non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) uptake has been reported to follow two pathways, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent (Wright, T. L., Brissot, P., Ma, W. L., and Weisiger, R. A. (1986) <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 261, 10909–10914; Sturrock, A., Alexander, J., Lamb, J., Craven, C. M., and Kaplan, J. (1990) <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 265, 3139–3145). Studies reporting the two pathways have ignored the weak interactions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with the chelator nitrilotriacetate (NTA) and the reducing agent ascorbate. These studies used a constant ratio of total Fe<sup>2+</sup> to NTA with and without Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of NTBI uptake in PC12 cells with the characteristics reported for other cells upon using 1 mm ascorbate and a constant ratio of total Fe<sup>2+</sup> to NTA with or without Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not affect NTBI uptake in solutions without NTA. We then determined conditional stability constants for NTA binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> by potentiometry under conditions of NTBI uptake experiments (pH, ionic strength, temperature, ascorbate, total Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and total Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations). In solutions based on these constants and taking Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation into account, Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not affect NTBI uptake over a range of free Fe<sup>2+</sup>concentrations. Thus, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of NTBI uptake observed using the constant total Fe<sup>2+</sup> to NTA ratio was because of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NTA chelation rather than an activation of the NTBI transporter itself. It is suggested that the previously reported Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of NTBI uptake be re-evaluated."
