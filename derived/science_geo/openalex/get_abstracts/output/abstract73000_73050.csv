https://openalex.org/W2049504060,"Phosphonomycin is a newly discovered antibiotic produced by streptomycetes. It is effective, when administered by the oral route, to mice infected with Gram-positive or Gram-negative microorganisms. The antibiotic is bactericidal and inhibits cell-wall synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009867923,"If, after prolonged observation of a striped pattern, one views a grating of the same orientation with somewhat narrower bars, then the bars seem even thinner than in fact they are. Broader bars seem broader still. This finding implies a system of size-detecting channels in humnan vision. The phenomenon may underlie many of the classical figural aftereffects."

https://openalex.org/W1980079645,"A lower limit of 0.1 year for the residence time of carbon monIoxide in the atmosphere is derived from radiocarbon measurements. The action of certain microorganisms and atmospheric photochemical reactions are possible mechanisms for the removal of carbon monoxide. This value can be compared with 2.7 years, a value deduced from estimated rates of carbon monoxide production and global measurements of atmospheric concentrations of carbon monoxide."

https://openalex.org/W2006152486,"Cyproterone reduces the accumulation of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in seminal vesicles 30 minutes after intravenous administration of tritiated testosterone to castrated rats. Testosterone, added in vitro, binds to macromolecules from the supernatant fraction of the seminal vesicle homogenates; this interaction is antagonized competitively by cyproterone. Cyproterone may diminish androgenic effects by competition for binding molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1983985087,"Frullania spp. (Hepaticae, Jungermanniales) are agents of allergies. Extraction and fractionation of Frullania tamarisci has given, as the only allergenic component isolated, a levorotatory crystalline sutbstance, the structure of which is demonstrated. It is a sesquiterpene lactone. The racemic (+/-) form is isolated from a mixed sample of Frullania tamarisci and Frullania dilatata; the dextrorotatory form, from Frullania dilatata. The observed allergenic properties are shared by some other-sesquiterpene lactones."

https://openalex.org/W2126107438,"The adult carabid beetle Pterostichus brevicornis tolerates freezing under natural conditions. Laboratory tests confirm that winter beetles tolerate temperatures below -35 degrees C, whereas summer beetles die if frozen at -6.6 degrees C. Winter beetles can be cooled to about -10 degrees C before freezing, and they thaw near -3.5 degrees C. Summer beetles thaw at -0.7 degrees C. To avoid freezing damage even in winter beetles, cooling rates must be near 20 degrees C per hour or less."

https://openalex.org/W2031285037,"Injections of D-lysergic acid diethylamide decrease the turnover rate of 5-hydroxytryptamine of rat brain, as measured from the conversion of 14C-tryptophan into 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine. The 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide given in doses fivefold greater than those of lysergic acid diethylamide fails to change the rate of 14C-tryptophan conversion into 14C-5-hydroxytryptamine. The effect of D-lysergic acid diethylamide is discussed with regard to its action on brain serotonergic neurons and its psychotomimetic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2089342949,Emissivities and ratios of surface areas of metabolic chambers and their contents have been usually ignored in studies of the metabolic rates of animals. Failure to take these factors into account can lead to errors in the interpretation of results.

https://openalex.org/W2078469789,"Animals will work to produce changes in hypothalamic temperature. The two main inputs, skin and hypothalamic temperatures, combine to control this behavior. Specifically, the rate at which rats work for changes in hypothalamic temperature is proportional to the sum of the weighted displacements of skin and hypothalamic temperatures from their respective neutral values."

https://openalex.org/W1991998600,Mitotic proliferation in the bone marrow of female rats and mice kept under standardized coniditions with light from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. exhibited a significant circadian periodicity with the greatest activity occurring from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon. The reticulocyte levels in peripheral blood were highest at 8:00 a.m.

https://openalex.org/W2059917279,"Pigeons received lights of varying wavelengths paired with sounds of varying frequencies; pecking was reinforced only at one stimulus combination. Then either the light or the sound was held constant at its reinforced value, while the other stimulus continued to vary. Subsequent tests showed that the constant stimulus had lost much of its control over the birds' responses."

https://openalex.org/W1997735906,"An improved method for preparing polyethylene replicas of skin from silicone rubber molds was developed for examination in the scanning electron microscope. Electro micrographs of the replicas compare favorably to those of fixed tissues from the same animal. Because of the great depth of field of the scanning electron microscope, both loosely attached epidermal cells and the background epidermal surface can be seen simultaneously in sharp focus, thus providing a more complete picture of the topography of skin."

https://openalex.org/W2069940579,"In voltage clamped photoreceptor cells of the barnacle, light-induced membrane current varied nonlinearly with membrane potential and changed sign at about + 27 millivolts (reversal potential) independently of light intensity. Instantaneous current-voltage relations were linear and intersected the voltage axis at the reversal potential. Illumination increased membrane conductance that was dependent on membrane potential, light intensity, and time."

https://openalex.org/W1980959421,"RENIN-LIKE activity has been found in several extra renal tissues1–3, and the isolated perfused rabbit uterus releases renin-like material in response to pharmacological stimulants4. Capelli et al.5 found plasma renin-like activity in anephric women but not in two anephric men. Finding detectable renin-like activity only in the uterus at post-mortem in one female, they postulated uterus as the likely source of the plasma renin-like material. The present study provides evidence of renin-like material in male as well as female anephric patients, thus implicating a source other than uterus for some of this material."

https://openalex.org/W2093375242,"RECENTLY we reported1 a dramatic effect of germ-free status (GF) on the induction of hepatomas by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) injected subcutaneously at birth into C3H male mice. In the experiments then reported, mice were killed at 30 to 41 weeks, and very few neoplasms apart from hepatomas were encountered. Twenty-two out of thirty-seven DMBA-treated minimum-disease mice had hepatomas and three had pulmonary adenomas, compared with three out of thirty-four DMBA-treated GF mice with hepatomas and two with pulmonary tumours. Here we report studies on the female C3H mice corresponding to the males covered by the previous report. Details of the origin and maintenance of mice, of the genetic relationship between mice kept GF and those kept under minimum disease (MD) conditions, and of the source and method of administration of DMBA, have been reported1. Horse anti-mouse lymphocyte serum (ALS) was obtained from Burroughs Wellcome. A preliminary assay of the batch used showed that doses of 0.5 ml. on days 2 and 5 after grafting prolonged the retention of A-strain skin grafts on CBA-strain mice from the normal 11 days to more than 20 days."

But intuition can be misleading; therefore, a more careful analysis is needed."

https://openalex.org/W2089178680,"THE recent report by Bremer, Nützenadel and Bickel1 of the use of prepared thin-layer plates of cellulose for screening of plasma for inborn errors of amino-acid metabolism prompts us to report our experience with prepared cellulose layers on aluminium foil (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for screening of both plasma and urine. Thin-layer chromatography of amino-acids on cellulose is faster, and has greater sensitivity and resolution, than paper chromatography2,3 without sample preparation. Additionally, the flexible aluminium foils can be dipped in the location reagent instead of being sprayed, and appropriate sections cut out for testing with specific reagents."
