https://openalex.org/W2084438073,"INACTIVATION of tobacco mosaic virus by X-rays has been studied by Gowen and Price, by Lea and associates1 and by us2. The fraction surviving is an exponential function of dose with D 0 about 2.3 × 105 r. This value corresponds to a target 3000 A. long and about 40 A. in diameter2."
https://openalex.org/W2078161442,"IT has been found that mammalian cornea is capable of eliciting an immunity reaction and of succumbing to it1. The following is a report of findings that human corneas possess A and B blood-group specific substances. Homogenized corneal tissue, obtained under sterile precautions by trephining the central portion of the cornea from cadavers, not later than 12 hr. after death, was used for adsorption of high-titred normal human sera. To 0.5 ml. of A, B and O sera, diluted 1 : 2 with normal saline, 0.5 ml. of corneal homogenate was added. The adsorption was carried out at 6° C. for 8 hr., the serum-cornea mixture being shaken every 15–30 min. The anti-4 and anti-B titre of the serum was examined against erythrocytes by the double serial dilution method, both before and after adsorption."
https://openalex.org/W2067428064,"IN the course of investigations into the colloidal properties of bilirubin, it was found that inhibition of the diazo-reaction in acid solution is caused by the association of bilirubin with the formation of colloidal solutions of bilirubin. The diazo-reaction at acid pH occurs only if bilirubin remains in the monomolecular state1."
https://openalex.org/W2084291592,"PREVIOUS work on the crystal structure of azulene1 has shown that the apparent space group is P21/a (C 5 2h) with two molecules in the unit cell. This implies a centrosymmetric molecule, which is in conflict with the chemical evidence. The two most likely explanations of this discrepancy are: (a) that the implied centre of symmetry is only statistically true, and is due to rotating molecules or a disordered structure; or (b) that the absent spectra leading to the deduction of the space group P21/a are accidental, and that the true space group is really of lower symmetry. Günthard2 has discussed these possibilities, and in recent work3 has shown that a comparison of the entropies of azulene and naphthalene (which has similar lattice dimensions) appears to confirm the presence of some disorder in the azulene crystal."

https://openalex.org/W2022451287,"AN alkaloid, dioscorine, has been isolated from various species of yam of the family Dioscoreaceae. Pinder1 has summarized the history of this, confirmed its molecular formula as C13H19O2N and has documented certain of its chemical and physical properties2. A similar alkaloid has been extracted from a further species common in the wild state in Nigeria and identified by its botanical characteristics and typically small starch grains as Dioscorea dumetorum (Yoruba name, èsúru3)."

https://openalex.org/W1982870997,"VARIATION in dose-rate has generally been observed to be ineffective in determining the incidence of mutations and structural changes produced by X-rays in Drosophila spermatozoa1. However, since it is now clear that a considerable fraction of the genetic damage brought about by radiation results from an indirect path of action, intensity effects might be expected to operate under certain conditions. Chemical mutagens induced by radiation must have a finite life-span before they are removed or rendered ineffective by one or another metabolic pathway. Therefore very high dose-rates, leading to an accumulation of mutagens, should effect a greater amount of damage as a result of diffusion of the active substances to other regions within the nucleus. Sobels's observations2 that pretreatment with cyanide or azide increases the yield of sex-linked lethals obtained from irradiated Drosophila males suggests that the accumulation of chemical mutagens can be facilitated by the concurrent use of suitable enzyme inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2056150351,"SINCE the majority of micro-organisms which are known to produce antibiotics are soil inhabitants, there has been considerable speculation whether they can produce these antibiotics in their natural environment. It is now generally accepted that if antibiotics are produced in the soil, this would probably occur in localized micro-environments where there is a favourable food supply, such as around particles of plant debris or in the rhizospheres of certain plants."

https://openalex.org/W1988194201,"PEAT and his collaborators1–3 have found that amylose prepared from potato, sago, maize and tapioca starch cannot be degraded by purified β-amylase or phosphorylase to an extent greater than about 70 per cent. Retrogradation of the amylose, which might have accounted for this, has been ruled out2, leaving the implication that a proportion of the molecules of amylose have either an anomalous non-reducing end-group, or an anomalous group at some point along the chain. Peat, Thomas and Whelan4,5 find that the anomaly can be removed by treating amylose with a β-glucosidase, termed Z-enzyme, and therefore suggest that it may result from the presence of a single glucose residue attached to the main chain by a link of β-configuration."

https://openalex.org/W1998869173,"HÆMOGLOBIN C was first detected among American Negroes, and figures for its incidence range between 1.41 and 3 per cent2. As the anomaly seemed virtually absent in the white race, it was reasonable to suppose that the gene responsible for it had been imported from Africa in the times of slave trade. This was soon confirmed by a survey of Edington and Lehmann3, who found hæmoglobin C to be present in 12 per cent of 200 hospital out-patients in Accra (Gold Coast). Recently, individuals with this hæmoglobin have been reported from French North Africa4. It is also known to exist in Liberia and in French West Africa (Neel, J. V., personal communication)."
https://openalex.org/W2986544682,"DR. C. AUERBACH is a recognized authority on the induction of mutations, and her publications are likely to carry considerable weight. There is a danger, therefore, that the recent letter in Nature1 (claiming to have detected greater mutational sensitivity in spermatids than in sperm) may have greater weight attached to it than the results would warrant. The authors admit the paucity of their data ; but a number of other criticisms can be made."

https://openalex.org/W2077774880,THAT Sporocytophaga myxococcoides is unable to grow on xylan and xylose has been shown by several investigators1 ; for that reason the organism was used in an investigation to find if cellulase is able to decompose xylan. Fuller and Norman2 report a disappearance of xylan from corn stalk cellulose during growth of Sporocytophaga myxococcoides.
https://openalex.org/W4232273320,"PALMAR sweating increases in young women when their environmental temperature is artificially raised1, and it is therefore reasonable to suppose that palmar sweating is related directly to environmental temperature and will vary with it in the different seasons of the year. As a preliminary test of the supposition, five women aged 18–20 years were observed for a month in summer and a month in winter, menstrual months being chosen in preference to calendar months to eliminate luteal effects2. The menstrual cycles chosen to represent summer and winter were those which began in August and in February."

https://openalex.org/W2988250151,"IN a recent communication in Nature, Yuasa1 contends that the ‘side-body’ of the spores of Bacillus megaterium is identical with the spindle of the dividing yeast nucleus, and acts as such in a mitotic division of the bacterial nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2073909346,"In the report of the recent conference in Kampala, Uganda, “Zoonoses in East Africa”1, I was quoted as suggesting that Trypanosoma rhodesiense had developed from Tr. brucei by repeated passages through Glossina pallidipes. My thesis was, in fact, almost the exact opposite of this. I emphasized that all the evidence so far shows that the property of infectivity to man which alone distinguishes Tr. rhodesiense from Tr. brucei is an extremely stable one and that there has never been a known case of interconversion of these two. On the other hand, I pointed out, in any area where Tr. rhodesiense had appeared, either it could be traced to direct introduction by infected human beings from a known source, or the other human infective ‘species’, Tr. gambiense, had been known to be present in the area for some time."
