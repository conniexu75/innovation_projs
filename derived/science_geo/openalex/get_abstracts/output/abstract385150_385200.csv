https://openalex.org/W2030249003,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is complicated by pro-oxidant intraneuronal Fe2+ elevation as well as extracellular Zn2+ accumulation within amyloid plaque. We found that the AD β-amyloid protein precursor (APP) possesses ferroxidase activity mediated by a conserved H-ferritin-like active site, which is inhibited specifically by Zn2+. Like ceruloplasmin, APP catalytically oxidizes Fe2+, loads Fe3+ into transferrin, and has a major interaction with ferroportin in HEK293T cells (that lack ceruloplasmin) and in human cortical tissue. Ablation of APP in HEK293T cells and primary neurons induces marked iron retention, whereas increasing APP695 promotes iron export. Unlike normal mice, APP−/− mice are vulnerable to dietary iron exposure, which causes Fe2+ accumulation and oxidative stress in cortical neurons. Paralleling iron accumulation, APP ferroxidase activity in AD postmortem neocortex is inhibited by endogenous Zn2+, which we demonstrate can originate from Zn2+-laden amyloid aggregates and correlates with Aβ burden. Abnormal exchange of cortical zinc may link amyloid pathology with neuronal iron accumulation in AD."

Here we report that SREBP-1c, a key lipogenic activator, is an in vivo target of SIRT1. SIRT1 interaction with SREBP-1c was increased during fasting and decreased upon feeding, and consistently, SREBP-1c acetylation levels were decreased during fasting in mouse liver. Acetylated SREBP-1c levels were also increased in HepG2 cells treated with insulin and glucose to mimic feeding conditions, and down-regulation of p300 by siRNA decreased the acetylation. Depletion of hepatic SIRT1 by adenoviral siRNA increased acetylation of SREBP-1c with increased lipogenic gene expression. Tandem mass spectrometry and mutagenesis studies revealed that SREBP-1c is acetylated by p300 at Lys-289 and Lys-309. Mechanistic studies using acetylation-defective mutants showed that SIRT1 deacetylates and inhibits SREBP-1c transactivation by decreasing its stability and its occupancy at the lipogenic genes. Remarkably, SREBP-1c acetylation levels were elevated in diet-induced obese mice, and hepatic overexpression of SIRT1 or treatment with resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator, daily for 1 week decreased acetylated SREBP-1c levels with beneficial functional outcomes. These results demonstrate an intriguing connection between elevated SREBP-1c acetylation and increased lipogenic gene expression, suggesting that abnormally elevated SREBP-1c acetylation increases SREBP-1c lipogenic activity in obese mice. Reducing acetylation of SREBP-1c by targeting SIRT1 may be useful for treating metabolic disorders, including fatty liver, obesity, and type II diabetes.

We and others showed that SREBP-1c also plays a role in suppression of hepatic bile acid biosynthesis in response to insulin under feeding conditions by inhibiting transcription of Cyp7a1 (cholesterol 7α hydroxylase), the rate-limiting bile acid synthetic enzyme (24Ponugoti B.

Although extensive studies have shown beneficial functions of SIRT1 in metabolic regulation, how SIRT1 inhibits hepatic lipogenesis and whether a key lipogenic activator SREBP-1c is an in vivo target of SIRT1 is not fully understood. Using in vivo animal studies as well as molecular and cellular studies, we obtained compelling evidence indicating that SREBP-1c is an important in vivo target of SIRT1 in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. Lys-289 and Lys-309 near and within the DNA binding domain of SREBP-1c, respectively, is the target of p300 acetylase and SIRT1 deacetylase. Deacetylation of SREBP-1c by SIRT1 inhibited SREBP-1c activity by decreasing its stability and its association with its lipogenic target gene promoters. SREBP-1c acetylation levels were dynamically regulated during fasting and feeding cycles and increased in HepG2 cells treated with insulin and glucose. Remarkably, SREBP-1c acetylation levels were highly elevated in diet-induced obese mice, and overexpression of SIRT1 decreased the acetylation levels with changes in metabolic gene expression expected to be beneficial. COS-1 cells and mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa1c1c7) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells (ATCC HB8065) were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cell-based functional reporter assays were performed as described previously (24Ponugoti B. Fang S. Kemper J.K. Mol.

COS-1 or Hepa1c1c7 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine, and HepG2 cells were transfected by electroporation to improve transfection efficiency. SREBP-1c mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, Inc.) and confirmed by sequencing. 8–10-week-old male BALB/c mice were maintained on a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. Mice were randomly divided into groups and fasted overnight with free access to water or fasted overnight and then fed standard chow for 3 h as described previously (8Kemper J.K. Xiao Z. Ponugoti B.

Normal or obese mice were injected with Ad-FLAG-SIRT1, Ad-siSIRT1, or control Ad-empty (0.5–1.0 × 109 active viral particles in 200 μl of PBS), and 5–7 days after infection, mice were fasted overnight, and livers were collected for further analysis. For the diet-induced obese mouse studies, 8-week-old BALB/c mice were fed with either a standard normal chow or a high fat diet (42% from fat; Harland Teklad TD88137) for 16–20 weeks. Diet-induced obese mice were infected with Ad-FLAG-SIRT1, and 1 week later, livers were collected for acetylation assays. All of the animal use and adenoviral protocols were approved by the Institutional Use and Care of Animals and Biosafety Committees at the University of Illinois and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. CHX experiments were performed as described previously (32Miao J. Xiao Z. Kanamaluru D. Min G. Yau P.M. Veenstra T.D. Ellis E. Strom S. Suino-Powell K. Xu H.E. Kemper J.K. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 986-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids for SREBP-1c wild type or mutants, along with CMV-His6-p300 (33Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 251-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or CMV-HA-SIRT1 (34Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16456-16460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), and then treated with CHX (10 μg/ml) for the times indicated in the figure legends. Cell extracts were prepared, and SREBP-1c levels were detected by Western analysis. Because of poor transfection efficiency in HepG2 cells, in-cell ubiquitination studies utilizing transfection were carried out in mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids for SREBP-1c and HA-ubiquitin in the presence of SIRT1 expression plasmid. Cells were treated with 5 μm MG132 for 5 h, and cell extracts were prepared under denaturing conditions using radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). FLAG-SREBP-1c was immunoprecipitated with M2 antibody (Sigma), and after washing in radioimmune precipitation buffer, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and HA-ubiquitinated FLAG-SREBP-1c was detected by Western analyses using HA or ubiquitin antibody. For in-cell assays, COS-1 or mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells in 6-well plates were cotransfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-SREBP-1c, p300, and/or SIRT1. For adenoviral experiments, HepG2 cells were infected with an adenoviral vector expressing p300 siRNA (35Kuninger D. Stauffer D. Eftekhari S. Wilson E. Thayer M. Rotwein P. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or a control vector, and 24 h later, cells were incubated in serum-free low glucose (5 mm) medium overnight and then treated with insulin (100 nm) and high glucose (25 mm) for 30 min. To inhibit deacetylase activity, cells were treated with deacetylase inhibitors, 500 nm trichostatin A, and freshly prepared 10 mm nicotinamide (Nam) for 2–5 h before preparing the cell extracts. For in vivo acetylation assays, liver nuclear extracts were prepared in the presence of deacetylase inhibitors. Endogenous SREBP-1c was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h in radioimmune precipitation buffer and washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Acetylated SREBP-1c levels were detected by Western analyses using acetyl-Lys antibody (Cell Signaling, Inc.). For in vitro deacetylation assays, COS-1 cells (four 150-mm plates) were transfected with FLAG-SREBP-1c expression plasmids, and 48 h later, FLAG-SREBP-1c was isolated by M2 agarose and incubated with purified p300 and acetyl-CoA in buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH. 7.9, 10% glycerol). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the beads were thoroughly washed, and acetylated FLAG-SREBP-1c was incubated with purified GST or GST-SIRT1 in the presence of 50 μm NAD+ in deacetylation buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and acetylated SREBP-1c was detected by Western analysis using acetyl-Lys antibody. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed with an iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green PCR master mix. Target gene mRNA levels were normalized to those of 36B4. Co-IP and ChIP assays were performed as described (8Kemper J.K. Xiao Z. Ponugoti B. Miao J. Fang S. Kanamaluru D. Tsang S. Wu S.Y. Chiang C.M. Veenstra T.D.

For ChIP assays, HepG2 cells were transfected with expression plasmids using electroporation, and cells were incubated with serum-free low glucose medium overnight and then treated with 100 nm insulin and 25 mm glucose for 30 min and used for ChIP assays. Sequences of the primers for quantitative RT-PCR and ChIP assays are available upon request. To examine whether SIRT1 directly interacts with SREBP-1c, in vitro GST pull-down assays were performed. SREBP-1c interacted with full-length SIRT1 and a fragment (amino acids 214–441) containing the catalytic domain (Fig. 1, A and B). Because SIRT1 directly interacts with SREBP-1c through the catalytic domain, we asked whether SIRT1 can deacetylate SREBP-1c using in vitro deacetylation assays. SREBP-1c proteins were expressed in cells, purified, and used in deacetylation assays (Fig. 1C). Western analyses showed that SREBP-1c is acetylated in samples incubated with p300 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). Incubation of the acetylated SREBP-1c with GST-SIRT1 resulted in an NAD+-dependent decrease in acetylation, whereas no decrease was observed with the control GST (Fig. 1D, lanes 3–5). These results indicate that SIRT1 deacetylates SREBP-1c in vitro in an NAD+-dependent manner. Deacetylation of SREBP-1c by SIRT1 was further confirmed in cells. SREBP-1c was immunoprecipitated under stringent conditions with buffers containing SDS, and acetylated SREBP-1c levels were detected by Western analysis using acetyl-Lys antibody. Co-expression of SIRT1 wild type with p300 substantially reduced acetylation levels of SREBP-1c by over 60% (Fig. 1, E (lanes 2–4) and F), whereas co-expression of a SIRT1 mutant lacking the deacetylase activity resulted in increased acetylated SREBP-1c levels (Fig. 1, E (lanes 2, 5, and 6) and F). Similar results were observed with SREBP-1 in mouse Hepa1c1c7 cells (Fig. 1G). These results indicate that SIRT1 can deacetylate SREBP-1c in vitro and in cells. To directly demonstrate that SIRT1 deacetylates SREBP-1c in vivo, endogenous SIRT1 in mouse liver was acutely down-regulated by tail vein injection of an adenoviral vector expressing siRNA for SIRT1 (Ad-siSIRT1), and acetylation levels of SREBP-1c were examined (Fig. 2A). Hepatic SIRT1 levels were efficiently reduced in fasted mice infected with Ad-siSIRT1 compared with mice injected with Ad-empty, whereas control tubulin levels were not changed (Fig. 2B). SIRT1 depletion substantially increased acetylation levels of endogenous SREBP-1c in the livers of fasted mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Consistently, the addition of Nam, but not trichostatin A, to mouse liver extracts during immunoprecipitation increased acetylation levels of endogenous SREBP-1c (supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggest that SIRT1 deacetylates SREBP-1c in mouse liver in vivo. We also examined the effects of SIRT1 depletion on hepatic expression of metabolic genes. Consistent with elevated SREBP-1c acetylation levels resulting from down-regulation of hepatic SIRT1, which is expected to increase activity of SREBP-1c, the expression of Srebp-1c and Fas, key lipogenic genes, were significantly increased in these mice (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, down-regulation of SIRT1 significantly decreased expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, hepatic enzymes involved in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. The SIRT1 depletion also reduced the expression of a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation gene, cytochrome c, although the decrease was not statistically significant. Expression of fatty acid oxidation genes, such as Eci (enoyl-CoA isomerase) and Mcad, was also decreased significantly in the SIRT1-depleted mice. In contrast, expression of Pparβ/δ, an important regulator in energy balance (38Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), was not changed in these mice. These in vivo studies demonstrate that SIRT1 deacetylates SREBP-1c in the mouse liver, which correlates with beneficially expected gene expression patterns of lipid metabolic genes. Because SIRT1 deacetylates SREBP-1c (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2) and NAD+-dependent SIRT1 activity is increased under nutritional deprivation (1Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Gerhart-Hines Z. Puigserver P. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), acetylation levels of SREBP-1 would be expected to be decreased during fasting and increased upon feeding. To test this idea, we first examined whether acetylation levels of endogenous SREBP-1 in HepG2 cells are increased by treatment with insulin and glucose to mimic feeding conditions. Treatment with insulin and glucose slightly increased acetylation levels of endogenous SREBP-1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). Further treatment with Nam, a SIRT1 inhibitor, markedly increased the acetylation levels (lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that acetylation of endogenous SREBP-1 in HepG2 cells is increased under conditions that mimic feeding and SIRT1 deacetylates SREBP-1. It was previously reported from in vitro and cell culture studies that SREBPs are acetylated by p300/CBP acetylases (27Giandomenico V. Simonsson M. Grönroos E. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To test whether increased acetylation of SREBP-1 by insulin and glucose treatment is dependent on p300, endogenous p300 in HepG2 cells was down-regulated by siRNA, and acetylated SREBP-1 levels were detected. The p300 levels were decreased in cells infected with Ad-sip300, whereas control tubulin levels were not (Fig. 3B). The acetylated SREBP-1 levels were decreased in cells infected with adenoviral siRNA for p300 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that p300 acetylates SREBP-1 in HepG2 cells under conditions mimicking feeding. We next examined whether acetylation of SREBP-1c is regulated in response to fasting and feeding. Mice were fasted overnight or refed after overnight fasting, and livers were collected for further analyses (Fig. 3D). Hepatic SREBP-1c protein levels were substantially increased upon feeding (Fig. 3E, a), which is consistent with elevated mRNA levels of the key lipogenic Fas gene, a well known SREBP-1c target (Fig. 3F). Co-IP studies revealed that SREBP-1c interaction with SIRT1 was increased during fasting, whereas interaction with HNF-4 was increased during feeding (Fig. 3E, b–d). Consistently, acetylated SREBP-1c was barely detectable in fasted mice (Fig. 3G). Due to the dynamic nature of acetylation and deacetylation of SREBP-1c, it was challenging to consistently detect elevated acetylation of endogenous SREBP-1c under feeding conditions. These results, taken together with acetylation studies in vitro, in cells, and in vivo (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), suggest that SIRT1 decreases acetylated SREBP-1c levels during fasting. To better understand the functional roles of SREBP-1c acetylation, we sought to identify acetylation site(s) in SREBP-1c. It was reported that the SREBP-1a isoform is acetylated by p300 at Lys-333 in SREBP-1a (equivalent to Lys-309 in SREBP-1c) (27Giandomenico V. Simonsson M. Grönroos E. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Using tandem mass spectrometry and mutagenesis studies, we further identified Lys-289 as well as Lys-309 as acetylation sites (Fig. 4, A–D). Lys-289 and Lys-309 are highly conserved in vertebrates (Fig. 4E). To confirm these results, in-cell and in vitro acetylation assays were performed using SREBP-1c mutants (Fig. 4, F–I). Acetylation of SREBP-1c wild type was substantially increased in the presence of p300 in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4G, lanes 1 and 2). Acetylation of SREBP-1c was not markedly decreased with the K289R mutant, was somewhat decreased with K309R mutant, and was substantially reduced with K289R/K309R double mutant (Fig. 4, G and H). To directly determine if both residues are important for acetylation, in vitro acetylation assays were performed. Acetylated SREBP-1c was detectable with wild type, K289R, and K309R but was not detectable with the K289R/K309R mutant (Fig. 4I). Comparable levels of SREBP-1c wild type, K309R, and K289R/K309R were utilized in the in vitro acetylation assays (supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicate that both Lys-289 and Lys-309 sites are important for acetylation by p300. Acetylation of transcriptional factors, such as p53, Foxo-1, and FXR, influences their stability, DNA binding, and protein-protein interactions (6Daitoku H. Hatta M. Matsuzaki H. Aratani S.

https://openalex.org/W2042497384,"Alec Jeffreys and colleagues report that variation at PRDM9 in humans influences sperm recombination hotspot activity, independent of a consensus binding motif, as well as meiotic genome instability. PRDM9 has recently been identified as a likely trans regulator of meiotic recombination hot spots in humans and mice1,2,3. PRDM9 contains a zinc finger array that, in humans, can recognize a short sequence motif associated with hot spots4, with binding to this motif possibly triggering hot-spot activity via chromatin remodeling5. We now report that human genetic variation at the PRDM9 locus has a strong effect on sperm hot-spot activity, even at hot spots lacking the sequence motif. Subtle changes within the zinc finger array can create hot-spot nonactivating or enhancing variants and can even trigger the appearance of a new hot spot, suggesting that PRDM9 is a major global regulator of hot spots in humans. Variation at the PRDM9 locus also influences aspects of genome instability—specifically, a megabase-scale rearrangement underlying two genomic disorders6 as well as minisatellite instability7—implicating PRDM9 as a risk factor for some pathological genome rearrangements."

Moreover, GPR55 promotes cancer cell proliferation, both in cell cultures and in xenografted mice, through the overactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade.

https://openalex.org/W2171786302,"Fev is an ETS transcription factor essential for the generation of serotonin neurons. This study reports that ongoing Fev-directed transcription is required at different stages of life for multiple regulatory events that shape and maintain the serotonergic system. Furthermore, behavioral alterations can result from adult-onset perturbation of serotonergic transcription. Transcriptional cascades are required for the specification of serotonin (5-HT) neurons and behaviors modulated by 5-HT. Several cascade factors are expressed throughout the lifespan, which suggests that their control of behavior might not be temporally restricted to programming normal numbers of 5-HT neurons. We used new mouse conditional targeting approaches to investigate the ongoing requirements for Pet-1 (also called Fev), a cascade factor that is required for the initiation of 5-HT synthesis, but whose expression persists into adulthood. We found that Pet-1 was required after the generation of 5-HT neurons for multiple steps in 5-HT neuron maturation, including axonal innervation of the somatosensory cortex, expression of appropriate firing properties, and the expression of the Htr1a and Htr1b autoreceptors. Pet-1 was still required in adult 5-HT neurons to preserve normal anxiety-related behaviors through direct autoregulated control of serotonergic gene expression. These findings indicate that Pet-1 is required across the lifespan of the mouse and that behavioral pathogenesis can result from both developmental and adult-onset alterations in serotonergic transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1998826234,"Background Cells within tissues are subjected to mechanical forces caused by extracellular matrix deformation. Cells sense and dynamically respond to stretching of the matrix by reorienting their actin stress fibers and by activating intracellular signaling proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the mitogen-activated proteins kinases (MAPKs). Theoretical analyses predict that stress fibers can relax perturbations in tension depending on the rate of matrix strain. Thus, we hypothesized stress fiber organization and MAPK activities are altered to an extent dependent on stretch frequency. Principal Findings Bovine aortic endothelial cells and human osteosarcoma cells expressing GFP-actin were cultured on elastic membranes and subjected to various patterns of stretch. Cyclic stretching resulted in strain rate-dependent increases in stress fiber alignment, cell retraction, and the phosphorylation of the MAPKs JNK, ERK and p38. Transient step changes in strain rate caused proportional transient changes in the levels of JNK and ERK phosphorylations without affecting stress fiber organization. Disrupting stress fiber contractile function with cytochalasin D or Y27632 decreased the levels of JNK and ERK phosphorylation. Previous studies indicate that FAK is required for stretch-induced cell alignment and MAPK activations. However, cyclic uniaxial stretching induced stress fiber alignment and the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK and p38 to comparable levels in FAK-null and FAK-expressing mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Conclusions These results indicate that cyclic stretch-induced stress fiber alignment, cell retraction, and MAPK activations occur as a consequence of perturbations in fiber strain. These findings thus shed new light into the roles of stress fiber relaxation and reorganization in maintenance of tensional homeostasis in a dynamic mechanical environment."
https://openalex.org/W2039904177,"Cell cycle checkpoints are implemented to safeguard the genome, avoiding the accumulation of genetic errors. Checkpoint loss results in genomic instability and contributes to the evolution of cancer. Among G1-, S-, G2- and M-phase checkpoints, genetic studies indicate the role of an intact S-phase checkpoint in maintaining genome integrity. Although the basic framework of the S-phase checkpoint in multicellular organisms has been outlined, the mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Human chromosome-11 band-q23 translocations disrupting the MLL gene lead to poor prognostic leukaemias. Here we assign MLL as a novel effector in the mammalian S-phase checkpoint network and identify checkpoint dysfunction as an underlying mechanism of MLL leukaemias. MLL is phosphorylated at serine 516 by ATR in response to genotoxic stress in the S phase, which disrupts its interaction with, and hence its degradation by, the SCF(Skp2) E3 ligase, leading to its accumulation. Stabilized MLL protein accumulates on chromatin, methylates histone H3 lysine 4 at late replication origins and inhibits the loading of CDC45 to delay DNA replication. Cells deficient in MLL showed radioresistant DNA synthesis and chromatid-type genomic abnormalities, indicative of S-phase checkpoint dysfunction. Reconstitution of Mll(-/-) (Mll also known as Mll1) mouse embryonic fibroblasts with wild-type but not S516A or ΔSET mutant MLL rescues the S-phase checkpoint defects. Moreover, murine myeloid progenitor cells carrying an Mll-CBP knock-in allele that mimics human t(11;16) leukaemia show a severe radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype. MLL fusions function as dominant negative mutants that abrogate the ATR-mediated phosphorylation/stabilization of wild-type MLL on damage to DNA, and thus compromise the S-phase checkpoint. Together, our results identify MLL as a key constituent of the mammalian DNA damage response pathway and show that deregulation of the S-phase checkpoint incurred by MLL translocations probably contributes to the pathogenesis of human MLL leukaemias."

IntroductionCircadian rhythms are the natural ∼24-h cycles that are conserved across a wide variety of organisms, including Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and mammals. In mammals, these rhythms are entrained by light signals and are controlled by the “master clock” in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 2The abbreviations used are: SCNsuprachiasmatic nucleusRORretinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptorROREROR-response elementaRTLAryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-likePerperiodCrycryptochrome. in the brain. In the periphery, semi-autonomous clocks can be entrained to signals from the SCN and signals from other cues, including nutrient status (1Green C.B. Takahashi J.S. Bass J. Cell. 2008; 134: 728-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The mammalian circadian clock is controlled by a transcriptional/translational feedback loop involving several key proteins. The expression of these key proteins includes brain and muscle ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator)-like 1 (BMAL1), circadian locomotor output kaput (CLOCK), PERIOD (PER), and CRYPTOCROME (CRY). BMAL1 and CLOCK are members of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS family of transcription factors and form a heterodimer that targets E-box DNA elements in the promoters of the PER and CRY genes and activates their transcription. The CRY and PER proteins heterodimerize, and as the levels of this protein complex accumulate it effectively inhibits the activity of BMAL1/CLOCK limiting the expression of the PER and CRY genes. This feedback loop results in the oscillations in expression of BMAL1/CLOCK and CRY/PER that follow a circadian pattern (2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 3Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar).Two classes of nuclear receptors play a critical role in modulation of the mammalian circadian clock. The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs) and REV-ERBs modulate expression of the BMAL1 gene through two conserved ROR-response elements (ROREs) located within the BMAL1 promoter. Expression of BMAL1 is modulated by competition between RORs and REV-ERBs for binding the BMAL1 promoter and either activation (ROR) or repression (REV-ERB) of BMAL1 (4Guillaumond F. Dardente H. Giguère V. Cermakian N. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2005; 20: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The expression of RORα and REV-ERBα follows a circadian pattern (with opposing phases) leading to a circadian pattern of expression of BMAL1.Mice lacking Bmal1 completely lose circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness (5Bunger M.K.

This is likely due to compensatory mechanisms involving a homologue of Clock known as neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) (8DeBruyne J.P. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Nat.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 393: 524-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). NPAS2, like CLOCK, forms heterodimers with BMAL1 and effectively functions in the mammalian circadian clock (8DeBruyne J.P. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Nat.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar).Autonomous circadian rhythms also operate in peripheral tissues such as the liver where the circadian rhythm plays an essential role in regulation of metabolic function (1Green C.B.

The expression of arrays of genes is a function of the molecular clock in the liver and regulate functions, including carbohydrate, fatty acid, cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.

In this study, we show that like BMAL1 NPAS2 is also a direct target for ROR and REV-ERB allowing for coordinated expression of these genes.DISCUSSIONThe circadian clock is essential for normal physiological function. In mammals, the master clock is located in the brain, but peripheral clocks exist in organs such as the liver. Various signals from the environment, such as light, entrain the SCN, whereas the peripheral clocks are entrained according to signals from the SCN as well as other stimuli such as nutrient status. Heterodimers of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK or NPAS2 play an essential role in maintaining the circadian oscillations that occur within the mammalian clock. BMAL1 is a well characterized direct target gene of RORα and REV-ERBα, and oscillations in the expression of these two nuclear receptors influence the pattern of circadian expression of BMAL1 (4Guillaumond F. Dardente H. Giguère V. Cermakian N. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2005; 20: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 37Burris T.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is unclear how the dimerization partner of BMAL1 is regulated in a manner that would allow coordination of the relative amounts of the partners. It is clear that coordination of expression of BMAL1 with either NPAS2 or CLOCK is essential because BMAL1 alone is not transcriptionally active. In this study, we found that NPAS2, like BMAL1, is a direct target gene of RORα and REV-ERBα. We initially identified the NPAS2 gene as a putative RORα and REV-ERBα target gene based on results from two independent ChIP/chip screens indicating both RORα and REV-ERBα occupancy of the NPAS2 promoter. We found that the NPAS2 promoter contains two functional ROREs that bind to both RORα and REV-ERBα. Our observation that NPAS2 is a target gene for RORα and REV-ERBα suggests a mechanism by which the relative levels of NPAS2 and BMAL1 can be coordinately regulated ensuring that functional heterodimer is available for maintenance of the feedback loop that is responsible for the mammalian clock (Fig. 7). However, our data suggest that this is, in fact, more complex because the ROREs found in the BMAL1 versus NPAS2 promoter display differential responsiveness to REV-ERBα. Because two REV-ERB molecules in close proximity are required to recruit corepressor, two adjacent ROREs are needed for REV-ERBα to exhibit active transcriptional repression. In the BMAL1 promoter, the proximal and distal ROREs are separated by 26 bp, and this is sufficient for REV-ERB to recruit the corepressor NCoR and actively repress BMAL1 transcription (16Yin L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1452-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two ROREs in the NPAS2 promoter are separated by nearly 160 bp, and our data indicate that REV-ERBα cannot effectively repress transcription in this context but can still block the action of RORα as a transcriptional activator. Additionally, our data indicate that the affinity of RORα and REV-ERBα for the NPAS2 ROREs is considerably less than for the affinity for the BMAL1 ROREp. Thus, although there is some degree of conservation of factors that regulate the expression of NPAS2 and BMAL1, there are clear distinctions in how these factors function. The biological significance of these differences is currently unclear.Our observation that NPAS2 is a REV-ERBα target gene is particularly interesting because the activities of both of these proteins have been shown to be regulated by direct binding to heme. NPAS2 contains two heme-binding domains, and heme has been shown to be necessary for binding to E-box DNA elements in target gene promoters (38Mukaiyama Y. Uchida T. Sato E. Sasaki A. Sato Y.

Mutations in the PAS-A heme-binding domain of NPAS2 impair dimerization with BMAL1 and reduce DNA binding activity (40Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 41Ishida M. Ueha T. Sagami I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 368: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The heme binding domain has also been proposed to confer gas responsiveness (CO) to NPAS2. When CO is present in low micromolar concentrations, the DNA binding activity of heme-loaded NPAS2/BMAL1 heterodimers is inhibited but not for the heme-free heterodimer (42Dioum E.M. Rutter J. Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 2002; 298: 2385-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). REV-ERBα has been shown to function as a heme receptor where heme binding is necessary for the transcriptional repressor activity of the receptor (20Raghuram S. Stayrook K.R. Huang P. Rogers P.M. Nosie A.K. McClure D.B. Burris L.L. Khorasanizadeh S. Burris T.P. Rastinejad F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 43Yin L. Wu N. Curtin J.C.

A recent report demonstrated that REV-ERBα regulates the expression of δ-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1), the rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis (44Wu N. Yin L. Hanniman E.A. Joshi S.

However, based on the lack of active repression of NPAS2 expression by REV-ERBα, it is unclear what the role of heme may be under these circumstances. IntroductionCircadian rhythms are the natural ∼24-h cycles that are conserved across a wide variety of organisms, including Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and mammals. In mammals, these rhythms are entrained by light signals and are controlled by the “master clock” in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 2The abbreviations used are: SCNsuprachiasmatic nucleusRORretinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptorROREROR-response elementaRTLAryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-likePerperiodCrycryptochrome. in the brain. In the periphery, semi-autonomous clocks can be entrained to signals from the SCN and signals from other cues, including nutrient status (1Green C.B. Takahashi J.S. Bass J. Cell. 2008; 134: 728-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The mammalian circadian clock is controlled by a transcriptional/translational feedback loop involving several key proteins. The expression of these key proteins includes brain and muscle ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator)-like 1 (BMAL1), circadian locomotor output kaput (CLOCK), PERIOD (PER), and CRYPTOCROME (CRY). BMAL1 and CLOCK are members of the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS family of transcription factors and form a heterodimer that targets E-box DNA elements in the promoters of the PER and CRY genes and activates their transcription. The CRY and PER proteins heterodimerize, and as the levels of this protein complex accumulate it effectively inhibits the activity of BMAL1/CLOCK limiting the expression of the PER and CRY genes. This feedback loop results in the oscillations in expression of BMAL1/CLOCK and CRY/PER that follow a circadian pattern (2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 3Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar).Two classes of nuclear receptors play a critical role in modulation of the mammalian circadian clock. The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs) and REV-ERBs modulate expression of the BMAL1 gene through two conserved ROR-response elements (ROREs) located within the BMAL1 promoter. Expression of BMAL1 is modulated by competition between RORs and REV-ERBs for binding the BMAL1 promoter and either activation (ROR) or repression (REV-ERB) of BMAL1 (4Guillaumond F. Dardente H. Giguère V. Cermakian N. J. Biol. Rhythms. 2005; 20: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The expression of RORα and REV-ERBα follows a circadian pattern (with opposing phases) leading to a circadian pattern of expression of BMAL1.Mice lacking Bmal1 completely lose circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness (5Bunger M.K. Wilsbacher L.D. Moran S.M. Clendenin C. Radcliffe L.A. Hogenesch J.B. Simon M.C. Takahashi J.S. Bradfield C.A.

This is likely due to compensatory mechanisms involving a homologue of Clock known as neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) (8DeBruyne J.P. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). NPAS2 was initially discovered in the mammalian forebrain (9Reick M. Garcia J.A. Dudley C. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 293: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), but it has also been shown to be expressed in the periphery (10Rudic R.D. Curtis A.M. Cheng Y. FitzGerald G. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 393: 524-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). NPAS2, like CLOCK, forms heterodimers with BMAL1 and effectively functions in the mammalian circadian clock (8DeBruyne J.P. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 9Reick M. Garcia J.A. Dudley C. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 293: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Npas2 null mice exhibit deficiencies in circadian behavior (11Dudley C.A. Erbel-Sieler C. Estill S.J. Reick M. Franken P. Pitts S. McKnight S.L. Science. 2003; 301: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), but the Npas2-Clock double knock-out phenotype is much more severe (8DeBruyne J.P. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar).Autonomous circadian rhythms also operate in peripheral tissues such as the liver where the circadian rhythm plays an essential role in regulation of metabolic function (1Green C.B. Takahashi J.S. Bass J. Cell. 2008; 134: 728-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The expression of arrays of genes is a function of the molecular clock in the liver and regulate functions, including carbohydrate, fatty acid, cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2064593724,"Mammalian ageing is accompanied by accumulation of genomic DNA damage and progressive decline in the ability of tissues to regenerate. DNA damage activates the tumour suppressor p53, which leads to cell-cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis. The stability and activity of p53 are induced by DNA damage through posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation of Thr 21 and Ser 23 (refs 2, 3, 4, 5). To investigate the roles of DNA damage and p53 in tissue-regenerative capability, two phosphorylation-site mutations (T21D and S23D) were introduced into the endogenous p53 gene in mice, so that the synthesized protein mimics phosphorylated p53. The knock-in mice exhibit constitutive p53 activation and segmental progeria that is correlated with the depletion of adult stem cells in multiple tissues, including bone marrow, brain and testes. Furthermore, a deficiency of Puma, which is required for p53-dependent apoptosis after DNA damage, rescues segmental progeria and prevents the depletion of adult stem cells. These findings suggest a key role of p53-dependent apoptosis in depleting adult stem cells after the accumulation of DNA damage, which leads to a decrease in tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2099618343,"Background Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a workhorse laboratory technique for measuring the concentration of a target DNA sequence with high accuracy over a wide dynamic range. The gold standard method for estimating DNA concentrations via qPCR is quantification cycle () standard curve quantification, which requires the time- and labor-intensive construction of a standard curve. In theory, the shape of a qPCR data curve can be used to directly quantify DNA concentration by fitting a model to data; however, current empirical model-based quantification methods are not as reliable as standard curve quantification. Principal Findings We have developed a two-parameter mass action kinetic model of PCR (MAK2) that can be fitted to qPCR data in order to quantify target concentration from a single qPCR assay. To compare the accuracy of MAK2-fitting to other qPCR quantification methods, we have applied quantification methods to qPCR dilution series data generated in three independent laboratories using different target sequences. Quantification accuracy was assessed by analyzing the reliability of concentration predictions for targets at known concentrations. Our results indicate that quantification by MAK2-fitting is as reliable as standard curve quantification for a variety of DNA targets and a wide range of concentrations. Significance We anticipate that MAK2 quantification will have a profound effect on the way qPCR experiments are designed and analyzed. In particular, MAK2 enables accurate quantification of portable qPCR assays with limited sample throughput, where construction of a standard curve is impractical."
https://openalex.org/W2154080602,"Initial attachment of bacteriophage P22 to the Salmonella host cell is known to be mediated by interactions between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the phage tailspike proteins (TSP), but the events that subsequently lead to DNA injection into the bacterium are unknown. We used the binding of a fluorescent dye and DNA accessibility to DNase and restriction enzymes to analyze DNA ejection from phage particles in vitro. Ejection was specifically triggered by aggregates of purified Salmonella LPS but not by LPS with different O-antigen structure, by lipid A, phospholipids, or soluble O-antigen polysaccharide. This suggests that P22 does not use a secondary receptor at the bacterial outer membrane surface. Using phage particles reconstituted with purified mutant TSP in vitro, we found that the endorhamnosidase activity of TSP degrading the O-antigen polysaccharide was required prior to DNA ejection in vitro and DNA replication in vivo. If, however, LPS was pre-digested with soluble TSP, it was no longer able to trigger DNA ejection, even though it still contained five O-antigen oligosaccharide repeats. Together with known data on the structure of LPS and phage P22, our results suggest a molecular model. In this model, tailspikes position the phage particles on the outer membrane surface for DNA ejection. They force gp26, the central needle and plug protein of the phage tail machine, through the core oligosaccharide layer and into the hydrophobic portion of the outer membrane, leading to refolding of the gp26 lazo-domain, release of the plug, and ejection of DNA and pilot proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2080721744,"Phospholipases are critical enzyme mediators participating in many aspects of cellular function through modulating the generation of lipid 2nd messengers, membrane physical properties, and cellular bioenergetics. Here, we demonstrate that mice null for calcium-independent phospholipase A(2)γ (iPLA(2)γ(-/-)) are completely resistant to high fat diet-induced weight gain, adipocyte hypertrophy, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance, which occur in iPLA(2)γ(+/+) mice after high fat feeding. Notably, iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mice were lean, demonstrated abdominal lipodystrophy, and remained insulin-sensitive despite having a marked impairment in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after high fat feeding. Respirometry of adipocyte explants from iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mice identified increased rates of oxidation of multiple different substrates in comparison with adipocyte explants from wild-type littermates. Shotgun lipidomics of adipose tissue from wild-type mice demonstrated the anticipated 2-fold increase in triglyceride content after high fat feeding. In sharp contrast, the adipocyte triglyceride content was identical in iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mice fed either a standard diet or a high fat diet. Respirometry of skeletal muscle mitochondria from iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mice demonstrated marked decreases in state 3 respiration using multiple substrates whose metabolism was uncoupled from ATP production. Shotgun lipidomics of skeletal muscle revealed a decreased content of cardiolipin with an altered molecular species composition thereby identifying the mechanism underlying mitochondrial uncoupling in the iPLA(2)γ(-/-) mouse. Collectively, these results identify iPLA(2)γ as an obligatory upstream enzyme that is necessary for efficient electron transport chain coupling and energy production through its participation in the alterations of cellular bioenergetics that promote the development of the metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1975019924,"Background The cellulosome is a multi-enzyme machine, which plays a key role in the breakdown of plant cell walls in many anaerobic cellulose-degrading microorganisms. Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, a major fiber-degrading bacterium present in the gut of herbivores, has the most intricate cellulosomal organization thus far described. Cellulosome complexes are assembled through high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interactions. More than two-hundred dockerin-containing proteins have been identified in the R. flavefaciens genome, yet the reason for the expansion of these crucial cellulosomal components is yet unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We have explored the full spectrum of 222 dockerin-containing proteins potentially involved in the assembly of cellulosome-like complexes of R. flavefaciens. Bioinformatic analysis of the various dockerin modules showed distinctive conservation patterns within their two Ca2+-binding repeats and their flanking regions. Thus, we established the conceptual framework for six major groups of dockerin types, according to their unique sequence features. Within this framework, the modular architecture of the parent proteins, some of which are multi-functional proteins, was evaluated together with their gene expression levels. Specific dockerin types were found to be associated with selected groups of functional components, such as carbohydrate-binding modules, numerous peptidases, and/or carbohydrate-active enzymes. In addition, members of other dockerin groups were linked to structural proteins, e.g., cohesin-containing proteins, belonging to the scaffoldins. Conclusions/Significance This report profiles the abundance and sequence diversity of the R. flavefaciens FD-1 dockerins, and provides the molecular basis for future understanding of the potential for a wide array of cohesin-dockerin specificities. Conserved differences between dockerins may be reflected in their stability, function or expression within the context of the parent protein, in response to their role in the rumen environment."

https://openalex.org/W2052489628,"Background Forecasting the effects of global changes on high altitude ecosystems requires an understanding of the long-term relationships between biota and forcing factors to identify resilience thresholds. Fire is a crucial forcing factor: both fuel build-up from land-abandonment in European mountains, and more droughts linked to global warming are likely to increase fire risks. Methods To assess the vegetation response to fire on a millennium time-scale, we analyzed evidence of stand-to-local vegetation dynamics derived from sedimentary plant macroremains from two subalpine lakes. Paleobotanical reconstructions at high temporal resolution, together with a fire frequency reconstruction inferred from sedimentary charcoal, were analyzed by Superposed Epoch Analysis to model plant behavior before, during and after fire events. Principal Findings We show that fuel build-up from arolla pine (Pinus cembra) always precedes fires, which is immediately followed by a rapid increase of birch (Betula sp.), then by ericaceous species after 25–75 years, and by herbs after 50–100 years. European larch (Larix decidua), which is the natural co-dominant species of subalpine forests with Pinus cembra, is not sensitive to fire, while the abundance of Pinus cembra is altered within a 150-year period after fires. A long-term trend in vegetation dynamics is apparent, wherein species that abound later in succession are the functional drivers, loading the environment with fuel for fires. This system can only be functional if fires are mainly driven by external factors (e.g. climate), with the mean interval between fires being longer than the minimum time required to reach the late successional stage, here 150 years. Conclusion Current global warming conditions which increase drought occurrences, combined with the abandonment of land in European mountain areas, creates ideal ecological conditions for the ignition and the spread of fire. A fire return interval of less than 150 years would threaten the dominant species and might override the resilience of subalpine forests."

Methodology and Principal Findings The study included patients admitted to hospital, subjects of a seroepidemiologic cohort study, and participants identified from outbreak studies in Singapore. Baseline (first available blood sample) and follow-up blood samples were analyzed for antibody titers to H1N1-2009 and recently circulating seasonal influenza A virus strains by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus micro-neutralization (VM) assays. 267 samples from 118 cases of H1N1-2009 were analyzed. Geometric mean titers by HI peaked at 123 (95% confidence interval, CI 43-356) between days 30 to 39. The chance of observing seroconversion (four-fold or greater increase of antibodies) was maximized when restricting analysis to 45 participants with baseline sera collected within 5 days of onset and follow-up sera collected 15 or more days after onset; for these participants, 82% and 89% seroconverted to A/California/7/2009 H1N1 by HI and VM respectively. A four-fold or greater increase in cross-reactive antibody titers to seasonal A/Brisbane/59/2007 H1N1, A/Brisbane/10/2007 H3N2 and A/Wisconsin/15/2009 H3N2 occurred in 20%, 18% and 16% of participants respectively.

Retrospective analysis suggests that the incorporation of strong zinc-binding groups, such as hydroxamate functions, potentiates MMP inhibition but unfortunately in an indiscriminate manner affecting most members of the MMP family (7Yiotakis A.

The use of a less avid zinc-binding group, like the phosphoryl group present in phosphinic peptide transition state analogs, has led to a second generation of more selective MMP inhibitors, like the selective inhibitors reported for MMP-12 (macrophage-metalloelastase) (15Devel L.

The third generation MMP inhibitors possess no zinc-binding group and exploit mainly the depth of the S1′ cavity present in most MMPs (16Engel C.K. Pirard B. Schimanski S. Kirsch R. Habermann J.

This strategy has led to the discovery of the first extremely selective MMP-13 inhibitors, such as compound 1 (Scheme 1). The x-ray structure of MMP-13 in complex with compound 1 confirms that this compound enters deeply into the S1′ cavity of MMP-13 and involves an unusual S1′ loop conformation characterized by the presence of an additional S1′ side pocket, a feature absent from other MMP-13·inhibitor complex x-ray structures. Part of the S1′ side pocket of MMP-13 involves residues of the so-called S1′ loop, whose size and sequence varies among MMPs. The selectivity of compound 1 toward MMP-13 has been explained by the presence of Gly248, a unique feature of the S1′ loop of MMP-13 that allows it to adopt a main chain conformation that is energetically disfavored for other MMPs (16Engel C.K.

Another selective inhibitor without zinc-binding group has also been recently reported (compound 2; Scheme 1) for the MMP-8, MMP-13 pair (18Pochetti G. Montanari R. Gege C. Chevrier C. Taveras A.G. Mazza F. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the x-ray structure of 2 bound to MMP-8 again reveals the presence of an S1′ side pocket, with the distal part of 2 protruding into this pocket, in a manner similar to that observed in the MMP-13·1 complex. This suggests that the presence of an S1′ side pocket is not restricted to MMP-13 and might also occur in other MMPs through a displacement of the S1′ loop relative to the protein body. To explore this possibility, a series of compounds with no phosphinic zinc-binding group have been developed and screened against various MMPs, with the objective to identify highly selective MMP-12 inhibitors. Such attempts previously achieved only the identification of compounds with low potency toward MMP-12 and poor selectivity profile (like 3 in Scheme 1) (19Morales R. Perrier S. Florent J.M. Beltra J.

Recently, based on a large clinical study, testing for an association between both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding MMP-12, a detrimental role was attributed to the overexpression of MMP-12 (26Hunninghake G.M.

Furthermore, the need for MMP inhibitors with better selectivity profile is also justified by the poor outcomes observed in preclinical studies using broad spectrum inhibitors (31Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2349) Google Scholar, 32Overall C.M. Kleifeld O. Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 94: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and the opposing roles that MMPs play in pathologies like cancer (33López-Otín C. Palavalli L.H. Samuels Y. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 3657-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and atherosclerosis progression (30Johnson J.L. George S.J. Newby A.C. Jackson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15575-15580Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These studies have clearly indicated the absolute need to specifically target the MMPs involved in pathology progression and not those counteracting it. Ultimately, highly selective inhibitors are essential tools to obtain proof of principle for the efficacy of a chemical intervention in animal models, as compared with gene invalidation.DISCUSSIONThe development of most MMP inhibitors for the last 15 years has relied on the use of a strong zinc-binding group, such as hydroxamate, and by targeting the entrance of the S1′ cavity. This strategy was selected to obtain potent inhibition through tight hydroxamate/zinc ion interaction and maintaining the inhibitor in a low molecular weight range by limiting the size of the P1′ side chain. Unfortunately, although providing extremely potent MMP inhibitors, all of the compounds obtained through this strategy displayed poor selectivity toward MMPs and also targeted other unrelated zinc-metalloproteinases like NEP (14Saghatelian A. Jessani N. Joseph A. Humphrey M. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10000-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The use of a weaker zinc-binding group (carboxylate or phosphoryl group) led to more selective inhibitors, in particular for MMP-12 (15Devel L. Rogakos V. David A. Makaritis A. Beau F. Cuniasse P.

First, the present study demonstrates that pseudo-peptides with no phosphinic zinc-binding group in their structures can behave as potent MMP-12 inhibitors. Second, this study shows that exploring the bottom part of the S1′ cavity of MMP-12 by using long and bent P1′ side chain resulted in inhibitors showing even better selectivity profile than the best selective MMP-12 reported so far (compound 4) (15Devel L. Rogakos V. David A. Makaritis A. Beau F. Cuniasse P. Yiotakis A. Dive V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11152-11160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Third, this study indicates that the inhibitor P1′ side chain accommodation into the S1′ cavity occurs without major conformational shift of the S1′ loop, in contrast to what was observed with MMP-13 selective inhibitors (16Engel C.K. Pirard B. Schimanski S. Kirsch R. Habermann J. Klingler O. Schlotte V. Weithmann K.U. Wendt K.U. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 181-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and mixed MMP13/MMP-8 inhibitors (18Pochetti G. Montanari R. Gege C. Chevrier C. Taveras A.G. Mazza F. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Selective MMP-13 inhibitors have been proposed to select a particular/minor conformation of MMP-13 from a conformational ensemble. Even if this concept seems to apply also to MMP-8, noncanonical S1′ loop conformation in MMPs is poorly documented; thus translation of this approach for developing selective inhibitor toward other MMPs approach remains challenging. In contrast a lot of three-dimensional structures (x-ray or NMR) of MMPs are available in which a preferred S1′ loop conformation can be potentially targeted by inhibitors probing the bottom part of the S1′ cavity for developing more selective MMP inhibitors. Although this strategy is appealing, the present study shows that subtle variations in the inhibitor structure entail profound selectivity and potency variations. Potency and selectivity are in fact a function of several linked and complex parameters. Thus, the exact positioning of the P1′ side chain inside the S1′ cavity seems to be critical. Such positioning depends on the nature of the ring (isoxazole versus phenyl) in the inhibitor P1′ side chain at the entrance of S1′ cavity. The shape of the P1′ side chain is also important. A long P1′ linear side chain like in 23 strongly increases the inhibitor potency but yields a poor selectivity profile. Only with a bent side chain have the best results in terms of selectivity been achieved. Compounds 5 and 36 highlight how very subtle structural differences act in synchrony to yield a different selectivity profile. The small adjustments of the residues lining the S1′ cavity in response to inhibitor binding are difficult to predict, yet such knowledge could potentiate the use of structure-based design approach to develop highly selective inhibitors. These limitations explain why the development of selective MMP inhibitors has been so disappointing in the past 20 years.In summary, the present study reports how the systematic modification of the P1′ side chain has resulted in the identification of selective inhibitors. The absence of a zinc-binding group has facilitated the discovery process by strengthening the role played by the P1′ side chain and by removing the positional constraints associated with the zinc interaction. Considering the previous successes obtained with MMP-13, it appears extremely likely that more non-zinc-binding inhibitors of MMPs with high selectivity profile will be reported in the future. Whether such compounds will select highly or less populated S1′ loop conformations of MMPs is more difficult to foresee.

Extremely potent inhibitors of MMPs have been developed, but in most cases these compounds act as broad spectrum inhibitors of MMPs (9Brown S. Meroueh S.O. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The arguments that have been proposed to explain the difficulties in identifying inhibitors able to differentiate one MMP from another include: (a) marked sequence similarities between the catalytic domains of MMPs, (b) a well conserved enzyme active site topology (backbone RMSD between the MMP catalytic domains is 0.7–0.8 Å), and (c) the mobility of residues in the so-called S1′ specificity loop (10Moy F.J. Chanda P.K. Chen J. Cosmi S. Edris W. Levin J.I. Rush T.S. Wilhelm J. Powers R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 12658-12659Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Bertini I. Calderone V.

This study was conducted to study the role of TxA(2) in smoking carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-promoted cell survival and growth in human lung cancer cells. We found that NNK increased TxA(2) synthase (TxAS) expression and thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2)) generation in cultured lung cancer cells, the result of which was supported by the increased level of TxAS in lung cancer tissues of smokers. Both TxAS-specific inhibitor furegrelate and TxA(2) receptor antagonist SQ29548 completely blocked NNK-mediated cell survival and growth via inducting apoptosis. TxA(2) receptor agonist U46619 reconstituted a near-full survival and growth response to NNK when TxAS was inhibited, affirming the role of TxA(2) receptor in NNK-mediated cell survival and growth. Suppression of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) activity by its small interference RNA blocked the effect of NNK. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) also had a positive role. Altogether, our results have revealed that NNK stimulates TxA(2) synthesis and activates its receptor in lung cancer cells. The increased TxA(2) may then activate CREB through PI3K/Akt and extracellular ERK pathways, thereby contributing to the NNK-promoted survival and growth of lung cancer cells."

Recent studies showed that the p47phox Phox homology (PX) domain mediates phosphoinositide binding in vitro and regulates phorbol ester-induced NADPH oxidase activity in a K562 myeloid cell model. Because the importance of the p47phox PX domain in neutrophils is unclear, we investigated its role using p47phox knock-out (KO) mouse neutrophils to express human p47phox and derivatives harboring R90A mutations in the PX domain that result in loss of phosphoinositide binding. Human p47phox proteins were expressed at levels similar to endogenous murine p47phox, with the exception of a chronic granulomatous disease-associated R42Q mutant that was poorly expressed, and wild type human p47phox rescued p47phox KO mouse neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity. Plasma membrane NAPDH oxidase activity was reduced in neutrophils expressing p47phox with Arg90 substitutions, with substantial effects on responses to either phorbol ester or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and more modest effects to particulate stimuli.

In this study, we introduced PX domain mutations that impair phosphoinositide binding into full-length p47phox and examined the impact on NADPH oxidase activity elicited by soluble and particulate stimuli.

Mutations in the PX domain of p47phox that impair phosphoinositide binding led to impaired neutrophil NADPH oxidase activation on the plasma membrane but had little effect on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during phagocytosis, thus defining a differential role for the p47phox PX domain.

After sorting, K562-gp91phox cells were transfected with the p67Cherry plasmid under 1.5 mg/ml G418 selection for 3 weeks and sorted using a PE-Texas Red laser (BD FACSAria). K562-gp91phox/p67Cherry was cultured in the presence of 0.9 mg/ml G418. Amaxa kit V (Amaxa Biosystems) was used to transiently transfect 2 × 106 K562-gp91/p67Cherry cells with 2 μg of pRK5-p40phox and 2 μg of pEYFP-N1-p47phox (p47YFP) or mutants (40Li X.J. Tian W.

https://openalex.org/W1999001662,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomally inherited disorder that causes tumors to form in many organs. It is frequently caused by inactivating mutations in the TSC2 tumor-suppressor gene. TSC2 negatively regulates the activity of the GTPase Rheb and thereby inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Activation of mTORC1 as a result of lack of TSC2 function is observed in TSC and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). TSC2 deficiency has recently been associated with elevated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, which in turn correlated with cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1 (p27), a negative regulator of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). How AMPK in the absence of TSC2 is stimulated is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Rheb activates AMPK and reduces p27 levels in Tsc2-null cells. Importantly, both effects occur largely independent of mTORC1. Furthermore, increased p27 levels following Rheb depletion correlated with reduced Cdk2 activity and cell proliferation in vitro, and with inhibition of tumor formation by Tsc2-null cells in vivo. Taken together, our data suggest that Rheb controls proliferation of TSC2-deficient cells by a mechanism that involves regulation of AMPK and p27, and that Rheb is a potential target for TSC/LAM therapy."

In conjunction with the Na+/K+-ATPase, ENaC transfers Na+ from the luminal to the interstitial space. This transfer is crucial in regulating blood pressure through its role in renal Na+ absorption and in regulating airway surface liquid volume and mucociliary clearance through its role in airway Na+ absorption. In accord with its role in these processes, improper ENaC function is implicated in several disorders. There is a growing body of evidence that enhanced ENaC activity in the airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis contributes to depletion of airway surface liquids resulting in poor mucociliary clearance (1Rauh R.

Proteinuric states, characterized by excessive protein in the urine, are often accompanied by renal Na+ retention, volume expansion, and hypertension. Recent work indicates that volume expansion in proteinuric states reflects proteolytic activation of ENaC (5Kastner C. Pohl M. Sendeski M. Stange G. Wagner C.A. Jensen B. Patzak A. Bachmann S.

J. 2005; 88: 3966-3975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ENaC subunits are members of the much larger ENaC/Degenerin family of ion channel proteins. These channels share a few salient features as follows: 1) most are gated by ligands and/or mechanical forces; 2) they are Na+-permeable and blocked by amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic; and 3) each subunit has two transmembrane helices (six transmembrane helices for the full channel), short intracellular N and C termini, and a large extracellular region comprised of several domains. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) are also members of the ENaC/Degenerin family. The recently resolved structure of ASIC1 has provided important clues regarding the structural organization of ENaCs. Of note is that its extracellular region has well defined domains, termed finger, thumb, palm, knuckle, and β-ball. ENaC α and γ subunits undergo a very unusual form of regulatory processing. Each subunit can be cleaved at two (or more) distinct extracellular sites resulting in the liberation of a small stretch of amino acids and an increase in channel activity (10Bruns J.B.

For both subunits, we have shown that synthetic peptides corresponding to these released tracts, and subsets thereof, are inhibitory (12Passero C.J. Carattino M.D. Kashlan O.B. Myerburg M.M.

We reasoned that the inhibitory peptides and proteolytically liberated fragments have similar binding sites and inhibitory mechanisms. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of proteolytic activation of ENaC, we functionally characterized the binding site for an α subunit-derived 8-residue inhibitory peptide. To map sites within α ENaC that interact with this peptide, we systematically mutated individual residues within several peripheral regions of the α subunit to Trp and measured the effect of these mutations on peptide-dependent channel inhibition. As some mutations may indirectly affect the ability of the peptide to inhibit the channel, we analyzed our data within a thermodynamic framework that allowed us to deduce the direct effects of mutations on peptide-dependent channel inhibition. Using these data, we performed double mutant cycle experiments to identify pairwise interactions. We found two residues that interact with a site toward the N terminus of the peptide and one residue that interacts with the C terminus of the peptide. Our results suggest that the peptide binds to both the finger and thumb domains, with the N terminus of the peptide binding at the finger-thumb interface. Because the peptide is an allosteric inhibitor of ENaC, these data provide support for the importance of the finger-thumb interface in the mechanism of ENaC gating. Mouse α, β, and γ ENaC subunit cDNAs in pBluescript SK− vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used as templates to generate mutations using QuikChange II XL (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Direct sequencing was used to confirm target mutations. cRNAs for wild-type and mutant α, β, and γ mouse ENaC subunits were synthesized with T3 mMessage mMachineTM (Ambion, Austin, TX) and purified using RNeasy® MinEluteTM cleanup kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Stage V–VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 1 ng of cRNA of each ENaC subunit. The peptides were synthesized and HPLC-purified by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). All peptides were modified by N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation. Electrophysiological measurements were performed 22–30 h after injection using a GeneClamp 500B voltage clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), Clampex software (Axon Instruments), and a 20-μl oocyte recording chamber (Automate Scientific, San Francisco). Perfusion was controlled using a perfusion system employing a ValveLink8.2® controller and pinch valves (Automate Scientific). The standard bath solution was 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Bath solutions with lower NaCl (1 mm NaCl) were made by substituting NaCl with N-methyl-d-glucamine in the standard bath solution. 10 mm stock solutions of peptides dissolved in water were used to add peptide to bath solutions, as indicated. The amiloride-sensitive component of the whole cell Na+ current was determined by perfusion with bath solution supplemented with 10 μm amiloride and was defined as the ENaC-mediated current. Significance comparisons between groups were performed with Student's t test, analysis of variance, or nonlinear mixed regression model analysis, as indicated. To account for the dependence between repeated assessments of the same mutant under different experimental conditions, we used the nonlinear mixed effects R library nlme (15Pinheiro J.C. Bates D.M. Chambers J. Eddy W. Härdle W. Sheather S. Tierney L. Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-PLUS. Springer-Verlag, New York2000: 271-414Google Scholar) to estimate the parameters of Equation 3. In the NLMR model formulation of this regression problem, the uncertainty concerning the value of the ιmax parameter (fixed effect) may be directly obtained from the output of the software. Because the kinetic constants appear as random effects, only their values (not the associated uncertainty) can be estimated through NLMR. To evaluate the uncertainty in these values and calculate the statistical significance of the former being different from the wild type, we utilized Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Briefly, the parameter estimates obtained by nlme were used to initialize the Gibbs sampler (a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm), which was applied to the nonlinear regression problem of Equation 3. At convergence, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm provided simultaneous estimates for the model parameters and the associated uncertainties (S.E.). p values corresponding to the indicated hypotheses were calculated by Monte Carlo integration from the random samples obtained by the Gibbs sampler. These p values were adjusted by applying the Bonferonni correction, which in this case amounts to dividing the observed p value by the number of tests (number of different mutant types) examined. An adjusted value of p < 0.0001 was used to determine significance. For other multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student Newman-Keuls test and curve fitting to the Hill equation were performed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Oswego, OR). We sought to identify α ENaC residues involved in α subunit-derived inhibitory peptide (P8; Ac-LPHPLQRL-amide; corresponding α ENaC residues 211–218) binding by disrupting binding through site-directed mutagenesis. However, we recently suggested that mutations (or any stimulus) that shift the equilibrium to favor an open channel state will also alter the apparent affinity of the channel for the inhibitory peptide, regardless of whether the mutation directly alters the peptide-binding site (12Passero C.J. Carattino M.D. Kashlan O.B. Myerburg M.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 299: F854-F861Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This prediction is based on the notion that P8 is an allosteric inhibitor that thermodynamically stabilizes the closed state of the channel. As a consequence, factors that increase channel open probability (Po) are predicted to weaken apparent P8 affinity, as given by Equation 1,KP′=KPC/(1−PO)(Eq. 1) where K′P is the apparent P8 affinity, and KCP is the dissociation constant for P8 bound to the ENaC closed state (see Ref. 12Passero C.J. Carattino M.D. Kashlan O.B. Myerburg M.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 299: F854-F861Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This idea was tested using the fact that high [Na+] decreases ENaC Po, a phenomenon known as Na+ self-inhibition (16Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We measured the dose response of wild-type channels to P8 at three different external [Na+] (Fig. 1A). At low [Na+], where ENaC Po is high (16Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the apparent P8 affinity was reduced as predicted by Equation 1. Increasing channel Po through the introduction of a point mutation also evokes the same response. Mutating the pore-lining residue βSer-518 to Lys gives an estimated Po of 0.97 (17Condliffe S.B. Zhang H. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10085-10092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) resulting in a greatly reduced P8 affinity (Fig. 1B). Similarly, ENaC channels lacking the γ inhibitory tract have a high Po and exhibit reduced efficacy of a peptide derived from the α subunit inhibitory tract (18Carattino M.D. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25290-25295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of our mutations on P8 binding, we needed to determine whether mutations significantly enhanced channel Po, as this would indirectly reduce apparent P8 affinity. We recently observed a linear correlation between measurements of ENaC Po and Na+ self-inhibition (19Maarouf A.B. Sheng N. Chen J. Winarski K.L. Okumura S. Carattino M.D. Boyd C.R. Kleyman T.R. Sheng S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7756-7765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that measurements of Na+ self-inhibition could serve as a surrogate to estimate Po for each of our mutants. Na+ self-inhibition can be measured by rapidly replacing a 1 mm Na+ bath, where ENaC Po is high, with a 110 mm Na+ bath, where ENaC Po is lower (16Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Acutely raising [Na+] immediately increases the driving force, resulting in a peak current (IPeak) that subsequently declines to a steady state current (ISS) as the channel arrives at a new equilibrium at a lower Po (19Maarouf A.B.

With Na+ self-inhibition (ιNaSI) measured as ιNaSI = 100·(1 − ISS/IPeak), ENaC Po can be estimated using Equation 2,1−PO=0.02+0.012ιNaSI (Eq. 2) based on our previous report describing the relationship between Na+ self-inhibition and channel Po (19Maarouf A.B. Sheng N. Chen J. Winarski K.L. Okumura S. Carattino M.D. Boyd C.R. Kleyman T.R. Sheng S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7756-7765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Equation 3 provides an estimate of the percent of current inhibition by P8 (ιP8) derived from our previously presented scheme (12Passero C.J. Carattino M.D. Kashlan O.B. Myerburg M.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 299: F854-F861Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Equation 2,ιP8=ιmax[P8][P8]+KPC0.02+0.012ιNaSI(Eq. 3) In Equation 3, ιmax represents maximal P8 inhibition as a percentage of total ENaC current. Therefore, we can estimate KCP for each species by measuring its P8 inhibition at a given [P8] and its Na+ self-inhibition prior to peptide addition using Equation 3, which has the form of the Michaelis-Menten equation. The protease cleavage sites and excised inhibitory tract align within the finger domain of the channel. However, there is poor sequence identity between α ENaC and ASIC1 in their finger domains, including a 73-residue insert in α ENaC. As a result, the ASIC1 structure did not readily provide a predicted site of P8 interaction (Fig. 2A). To remedy this, we searched the RCSB protein data base and identified XC6422 from Xanthomonas campestris (PDB code 2FUK) as having two short interacting stretches of residues that share 70% sequence identity with α ENaC (Fig. 2B). One stretch corresponded to residues preceding and including P8, and the other stretch corresponded to the latter part of the finger including residues 287–294. Although XC6422 and α ENaC are not homologous, we hypothesized that a similar interaction might occur within α ENaC. Residues 287–294 in α ENaC roughly correspond to the α2-α3 loop in the late finger of ASIC1 (Fig. 2A). If P8 binds α ENaC near the α2-α3 loop, we hypothesized that nearby residues at the top of the thumb and the early finger may also be involved in P8 binding based on the ASIC1 structure. We tested our hypothesis by attempting to disrupt P8 binding through the introduction of bulky Trp residues at sites within three region as follows: 187–198 (early finger), 280–295 (α2-α3 loop; late finger), and 470–482 (top of the thumb). Based on these results, we extended our mutagenesis analyses to encompass residues 232–295 (late finger) and 466–487 (top of the thumb). Using Equation 3 above, we determined the underlying peptide-binding constant (KCP) of each mutant. To do this, we measured P8 (10 μm) inhibition (ιP8 = 100·(1 − IP8/ISS)) and Na+ self-inhibition (rapidly increasing [Na+] from 1 to 110 mm) of these mutants and of wild-type channels (Fig. 3, A and C). In addition, to fully characterize the relationship between P8 inhibition and Na+ self-inhibition for wild-type channels, we measured the P8 (10 μm) inhibition and Na+ self-inhibition of wild-type channels at 10 mm Na+ and P8 (10 μm) inhibition at 1 mm Na+ (Fig. 3B). To determine whether these mutations altered the peptide-binding constant, KCP, with respect to wild-type channels, we evaluated data for wild-type and mutant channels using NLMR models, which estimated the parameters of Equation 3 (Fig. 3C and supplemental Table S1). ιmax was a common parameter to the fits for all species, and KCP was an independent parameter for each species. For mutants where 10 μm P8 poorly inhibited the channel, we cannot readily distinguish between effects on KCP and ιmax in the absence of a dose-response curve. The fitted parameters for wild-type ENaC were similar to those determined from Fig. 1A in high [Na+]. Fig. 4A shows the average values of P8 inhibition and Na+ self-inhibition for each mutant overlaid with the fitted curve for wild-type ENaC. Mutants with peptide-binding constants similar to wild-type (Fig. 4A, black) had average P8 inhibition and Na+ self-inhibition values near the wild-type fitted curve. Mutants with weaker P8 affinity (Fig. 4A, red and blue) fell below the wild-type curve (p < 0.0001), and five of these mutants weakened KCP greater than 10-fold (blue; p < 0.0001).FIGURE 4Mutations at sites in the late finger and top of the thumb of α ENaC affect P8 inhibition.

The fitted curve for wild-type ENaC (see Fig. 3B) is overlaid for comparison. Statistical analyses using NLMR were performed to determine whether mutants bound P8 with weaker affinity (red and blue) or 10-fold weaker affinity (blue) than wild-type.

Mutations that reduced P8 inhibition at the top of the thumb occurred within a narrow range of positions (residues 470–473) and had modest effects on P8 inhibition. In contrast, mutations that reduced P8 inhibition were found throughout the late finger (residues 239–289) and had modest (Fig. 4B, red) to strong (blue) effects on P8 inhibition. These results suggest that P8 interacts primarily with residues in the late finger and with a limited number of residues at the top of the thumb. Having identified sites that likely interact with P8, we sought to identify specific pairwise interactions between α ENaC and P8. We previously characterized the inhibition of ENaC by P8 analogues bearing substitutions throughout the peptide (13Carattino M.D. Passero C.J. Steren C.A. Maarouf A.B. Pilewski J.M. Myerburg M.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F47-F52Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Many of these substitutions reduced apparent peptide affinity. We reasoned that a channel mutation that reduced P8 binding may be reversed by a compensatory mutation in P8 akin to a double mutant cycle where the free energy of coupling, ΔΔGint, is non-zero (20Horovitz A. Fold. Des. 1996; 1: R121-R126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We therefore selected α ENaC mutants with reduced P8 affinity discovered in our Trp scan, and subsequently screened them against these peptides (Table 1). We identified four complementary peptide-channel pairs where a peptide mutation partially restored channel inhibition; both αD473W and αR289W with the mutant peptide LPKPLQRL and both αG252W and αQ254W with the mutant peptide LPHPLQRA (the underlined residue has been changed). αD473W is at the top of the thumb domain, and αR289W, αG252W, and αQ254W are in the latter half of the finger domain.TABLE 1Screening data for mutant cycle analysis.

To investigate this further, we measured the affinity of several third position substituted 8-mers for αD473W and αR289W, as well as the affinity of several eighth position substituted peptides for αQ254W. In each case, we compared the results to the peptide binding affinity of wild-type ENaC (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Unfortunately, αG252W had a P8 affinity too weak for further study (data not shown). Although wild-type ENaC had 4-fold higher affinity for P8 than the αD473W mutant, these two channels had similar affinity for each of the peptides tested with third position substitutions. If ΔΔGint was zero (implying no coupling), we would have expected a 4-fold difference in affinity to be maintained for each of these peptides (i.e. the effects of peptide and channel mutations would be additive). We observed a similar effect for αR289W, where its 130-fold weaker affinity for P8 reduced to a 13-fold weaker affinity for each of the third position-substituted peptides tested. We also observed coupling between αQ254W and the eighth position of the peptide, so that a 10-fold difference in P8 affinity was eliminated for each of the eighth position-substituted peptides tested, as well as a 7-mer lacking a residue at this position. These results suggest that αAsp-473 and αArg-289 likely interact with the third position of P8 and that αGln-254 likely interacts with the eighth position of P8.TABLE 2Dose-response curve parameters for double mutant cycle experimentsPeptideIC50 (μm)αβγαD473WβγαR289WβγαQ254WβγLPHPLQRL0.78 ± 0.093.1 ± 0.9100 ± 109 ± 2LPYPLQRL2.5 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.732 ± 8LPEPLQRL30 ± 539 ± 9400 ± 20LPKPLQRL64 ± 950 ± 10LPHPLQRA50 ± 3050 ± 30LPHPLQRN56 ± 441 ± 6LPHPLQR_130 ± 90100 ± 70 Open table in a new tab To control for the indirect effect on P8 inhibition by the effect of a mutation on channel Po, we measured the Na+ self-inhibition response of each mutant. Several mutants exhibited an altered Na+ self-inhibition response as compared with the wild-type response (Fig. 6). The sites of these mutations spanned a wide portion of the latter half of the finger and a narrow region of the top of the thumb. The sites at the top of the thumb correspond to residues in the first half of helix α5. Although α ENaC sequence identity to ASIC1 is poor in the finger domain, the sites in the late finger include residues between 264 and 286 that may correspond to helix α2, and indeed the observed effects on Na+ self-inhibition occurred at sites flanked by 2 or 3 residues where mutations had no effect. Projected onto a helical wheel (Fig. 6C), it becomes clear that mutations between 270 and 286 that affect Na+ self-inhibition lie on one face of a putative α-helix. We recently reported similar results for the γ subunit (21Winarski K.L. Sheng N. Chen J. Kleyman T.R. Sheng S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26088-26096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The sites in the late finger between 236 and 256 correspond to no known structure, and the observed effects follow no discernable pattern. Proteolytic cleavage leading to channel activation is an unusual mechanism for channel regulation in biology. Although proteolytic cleavage has an important role in regulating ENaC, proteolysis may also regulate other members of the ENaC/Degenerin family (22Clark E.B. Jovov B. Rooj A.K. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27130-27143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For ENaC, both the α and γ subunits undergo proteolysis in association with channel activation (10Bruns J.B. Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Maarouf A.B. Weisz O.A. Pilewski J.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. J.

The activation of ENaC by proteolysis requires that a subunit be cleaved twice, releasing an intrinsic inhibitory tract. Peptides corresponding to the sequences of these excised tracts within the α and γ subunits inhibit ENaC currents (10Bruns J.B. Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Maarouf A.B. Weisz O.A. Pilewski J.M.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18901-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These inhibitory tracts reside within the variable finger domains of these subunits and have no analogs within ASIC1 or other ENaC/Degenerin family members (8Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified two distinct regions that are likely involved in the binding of an 8-residue peptide derived from the α subunit inhibitory tract. We note that mutations at these sites may have indirectly affected peptide binding through distortions of structure or access to the binding site, and we interpret our results mindful of this limitation. These regions encompass residues 470–473 in the thumb domain, and residues 239–289 in the finger domain. Neither region is contiguous with the α subunit inhibitory tract (residues 206–231) or residues corresponding to P8 (211–218). We also identified specific pairwise interactions between ENaC and P8. As Arg-289 and Asp-473 both interact with the third position of the peptide, our data suggest that Arg-289 and Asp-473 are in close proximity and that the N-terminal region of the peptide binds at a thumb-finger interface. As Arg-289 follows a stretch of residues that our Na+ self-inhibition data suggest is helical, our data suggest that a putative loop containing Arg-289 is in close proximity to the top of the thumb. This suggests that ENaC shares some common structural features with ASIC1 within the finger domain despite a lack of sequence identity in this region, as the α2-α3 loop within the finger domain of ASIC is also in close proximity to its thumb domain. We also found that Gln-254 interacts with the eighth position of P8. If the peptide assumes an extended conformation in the bound state, our data suggest that Gln-254 is not adjacent to the thumb-finger interface. There is now strong evidence that P8 is an allosteric inhibitor of ENaC. First, we previously found that P8 binding is not voltage-dependent despite the fact that it is positively charged at pH 7.4, suggesting that P8 does not bind within the ion permeation pathway of the channel (14Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Pilewski J.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18901-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Second, we have shown that apparent P8 affinity is influenced by channel open probability (Fig. 1, A and B). Third, we have identified mutations at residues in the finger and the thumb domains of α ENaC that attenuate P8 affinity, suggesting that P8 binds in the periphery of the channel and far from the pore. The finding that P8 is an allosteric inhibitor of ENaC leads to the conclusion that P8 inhibits the channel by preferentially stabilizing the closed state of the channel. Because P8 is derived from the furin-excised inhibitory tract, we suggest that the inhibitory tract functions largely through similar mechanisms. Based on this reasoning, we propose that furin activates ENaC through α subunit cleavage by removing an intrinsic allosteric inhibitor from a site partially defined by the finger-thumb interface. In the course of this study, we measured the Na+ self-inhibition of α subunit Trp mutants within the finger and thumb domains. Interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that we cannot readily distinguish between mutations that directly affect Na+ self-inhibition by altering Na+ binding and mutations that indirectly affect Na+ self-inhibition by altering the downstream allosteric machinery of the channel. For example, the βS518K pore mutant largely eliminates ENaC Na+ self-inhibition (21Winarski K.L. Sheng N. Chen J. Kleyman T.R. Sheng S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26088-26096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If this was evidence for a Na+-binding site nearby, Na+ self-inhibition would be predicted to be voltage-dependent, contrary to published work (24Bize V. Horisberger J.D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 293: F1137-F1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation is that βS518K stabilizes the open state of the channel relative to the closed state, raising the thermodynamic barrier to channel closure by Na+. Mindful of this limitation, our Na+ self-inhibition data provide evidence for an α-helix that encompasses residues 271–285. The finger domains of members of the ENaC/Degenerin family of ion channels are hypervariable, which leads to the hypothesis that the finger domains of these proteins are functional modules. In the case of α ENaC, the finger domain appends protease sensitivity and possibly Na+ sensitivity as well. Given the modular finger hypothesis and the large number of sites in the finger domain where mutations altered Na+ self-inhibition, some of these sites may be directly involved in Na+ binding. Also, consideration of the P8-binding site within the finger and at the finger-thumb interface suggests that P8, and by extension the α-inhibitory tract, recruits much of the same allosteric machinery as used by Na+.

To test the role of JNK, we examined the effect of ablation of the Jnk1 and Jnk2 genes in a Trp53-dependent model of breast cancer using BALB/c mice. We detected no defects in mammary gland development in virgin mice or during lactation and involution in control studies of Jnk1(-/-) and Jnk2(-/-) mice. In a Trp53(-/+) genetic background, mammary carcinomas were detected in 43% of control mice, 70% of Jnk1(-/-) mice, and 53% of Jnk2(-/-) mice. These data indicate that JNK1 and JNK2 are not essential for mammary carcinoma development in the Trp53(-/+) BALB/c model of breast cancer. In contrast, this analysis suggests that JNK may partially contribute to tumor suppression. This conclusion is consistent with the finding that tumor-free survival of JNK-deficient Trp53(-/+) mice was significantly reduced compared with control Trp53(-/+) mice. We conclude that JNK1 and JNK2 can act as suppressors of mammary tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2089598575,"Understanding the dynamics of the human range expansion across northeastern Eurasia during the late Pleistocene is central to establishing empirical temporal constraints on the colonization of the Americas. Opinions vary widely on how and when the Americas were colonized, with advocates supporting either a pre- or post- last glacial maximum (LGM) colonization, via either a land bridge across Beringia, a sea-faring Pacific Rim coastal route, a trans-Arctic route, or a trans-Atlantic oceanic route. Here we analyze a large sample of radiocarbon dates from the northeast Eurasian Upper Paleolithic to identify the origin of this expansion, and estimate the velocity of colonization wave as it moved across northern Eurasia and into the Americas.We use diffusion models to quantify these dynamics. Our results show the expansion originated in the Altai region of southern Siberia approximately 46kBP , and from there expanded across northern Eurasia at an average velocity of 0.16 km per year. However, the movement of the colonizing wave was not continuous but underwent three distinct phases: 1) an initial expansion from 47-32k calBP; 2) a hiatus from approximately 32-16k calBP, and 3) a second expansion after the LGM approximately 16k calBP. These results provide archaeological support for the recently proposed three-stage model of the colonization of the Americas. Our results falsify the hypothesis of a pre-LGM terrestrial colonization of the Americas and we discuss the importance of these empirical results in the light of alternative models.Our results demonstrate that the radiocarbon record of Upper Paleolithic northeastern Eurasia supports a post-LGM terrestrial colonization of the Americas falsifying the proposed pre-LGM terrestrial colonization of the Americas. We show that this expansion was not a simple process, but proceeded in three phases, consistent with genetic data, largely in response to the variable climatic conditions of late Pleistocene northeast Eurasia. Further, the constraints imposed by the spatiotemporal gradient in the empirical radiocarbon record across this entire region suggests that North America cannot have been colonized much before the existing Clovis radiocarbon record suggests."
https://openalex.org/W2016752687,"Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by misfolding of the normal prion protein (PrP) into a pathogenic ""scrapie"" conformation. To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the conformational changes (conversion) of PrP, we compared the dynamics of PrP from mammals susceptible (hamster and mouse) and resistant (rabbit) to prion diseases in transgenic flies. We recently showed that hamster PrP induces spongiform degeneration and accumulates into highly aggregated, scrapie-like conformers in transgenic flies. We show now that rabbit PrP does not induce spongiform degeneration and does not convert into scrapie-like conformers. Surprisingly, mouse PrP induces weak neurodegeneration and accumulates small amounts of scrapie-like conformers. Thus, the expression of three highly conserved mammalian prion proteins in transgenic flies uncovered prominent differences in their conformational dynamics. How these properties are encoded in the amino acid sequence remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2047629389,"The innate immune system is of vital importance for protection against infectious pathogens. Inflammasome mediated caspase-1 activation and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1beta and IL-18 is an important arm of the innate immune system. Salmonella enterica subspecies 1 serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium, SL1344) is an enteropathogenic bacterium causing diarrheal diseases. Different reports have shown that in macrophages, S. Typhimurium may activate caspase-1 by at least three different types of stimuli: flagellin, the type III secretion system 1 (T1) and the T1 effector protein SopE. However, the relative importance and interdependence of the different factors in caspase-1 activation is still a matter of debate. Here, we have analyzed their relative contributions to caspase-1 activation in LPS-pretreated RAW264.7 macrophages. Using flagellar mutants (fliGHI, flgK) and centrifugation to mediate pathogen-host cell contact, we show that flagellins account for a small part of the caspase-1 activation in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, functional flagella are of key importance for motility and host cell attachment which is a prerequisite for mediating caspase-1 activation via these three stimuli. Using site directed mutants lacking several T1 effector proteins and flagellin expression, we found that SopE elicits caspase-1 activation even when flagellins are absent. In contrast, disruption of essential genes of the T1 protein injection system (invG, sipB) completely abolished caspase-1 activation. However, a robust level of caspase-1 activation is retained by the T1 system (or unidentified T1 effectors) in the absence of flagellin and SopE. T1-mediated inflammasome activation is in line with recent work by others and suggests that the T1 system itself may represent the basic caspase-1 activating stimulus in RAW264.7 macrophages which is further enhanced independently by SopE and/or flagellin."

Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5/ARA55) is a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-induced coactivator of androgen receptor (AR) expressed in the prostate stroma. Interestingly, following castration, we identified epithelial expression of Hic-5/ARA55 in mouse and human prostate tissues. To determine the role of epithelial Hic-5 in prostate cancer progression and castration responsiveness, we compared LNCaP cells having Hic-5 stably expressed with the parental LNCaP cells following tissue recombination xenografts with mouse prostate stromal cells. We previously identified knocking out prostate stromal TGF-β signaling potentiated castrate-resistant prostate tumors, in a Wnt-dependent manner. The LNCaP chimeric tumors containing prostate fibroblasts conditionally knocked out for the TGF-β type II receptor (Tgfbr2-KO) resulted in larger, more invasive, and castration-resistant tumors compared those with floxed (control) stromal cells. However, the LNCaP-Hic5 associated with Tgfbr2-KO fibroblasts generated chimeric tumors with reduced tumor volume, lack of invasion and restored castration dependence. Neutralization of canonical Wnt signaling is shown to reduce prostate tumor size and restore regression following castration. Thus, we hypothesized that epithelial Hic-5/ARA55 expression negatively regulated Wnt signaling. The mechanism of the Hic-5/ARA55 effects on castration was determined by analysis of the c-myc promoter. C-myc luciferase reporter activity suggested Hic-5/ARA55 expression inhibited c-myc activity by β-catenin. Sequential ChIP analysis indicated β-catenin and T-cell-specific 4 (TCF4) bound the endogenous c-myc promoter in the absence of Hic-5 expression. However, the formation of a TCF4/Hic-5 repressor complex inhibited c-myc promoter activity, by excluding β-catenin binding with TCF4 on the promoter. The data indicate Hic-5/ARA55 expression in response to castration-enabled epithelial regression through the repression of c-myc gene at the chromatin level."

We have previously observed that genetic deletion of the CD8+ T cell effector molecule perforin leads to preservation of motor function and preservation of spinal axons in chronically demyelinated mice. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine if CD8+ T cells are necessary and sufficient to directly injure demyelinated axons, we adoptively transferred purified perforin-competent CD8+ spinal cord-infiltrating T cells into profoundly demyelinated but functionally preserved perforin-deficient host mice. Transfer of CD8+ spinal cord-infiltrating T cells rapidly and irreversibly impaired motor function, disrupted spinal cord motor conduction, and reduced the number of medium- and large-caliber spinal axons. Likewise, immunodepletion of CD8+ T cells from chronically demyelinated wildtype mice preserved motor function and limited axon loss without altering other disease parameters. Conclusions/Significance In multiple sclerosis patients, CD8+ T cells outnumber CD4+ T cells in active lesions and the number of CD8+ T cells correlates with the extent of ongoing axon injury and functional disability. Our findings suggest that CD8+ T cells may directly injure demyelinated axons and are therefore a viable therapeutic target to protect axons and motor function in patients with multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1999016480,"The RNA helicase p68 is a potent co-activator of p53-dependent transcription in response to DNA damage. Previous independent studies have indicated that p68 and the Δ133p53 isoforms, which modulate the function of full-length p53, are aberrantly expressed in breast cancers. Here we identify a striking inverse association of p68 and Δ133p53 expression in primary breast cancers. Consistent with these findings, small interfering RNA depletion of p68 in cell lines results in a p53-dependant increase of Δ133p53 in response to DNA damage, suggesting that increased Δ133p53 expression could result from downregulation of p68 and provide a potential mechanistic explanation for our observations in breast cancer. Δ133p53α, which has been shown to negatively regulate the function of full-length p53, reciprocally inhibits the ability of p68 to stimulate p53-dependent transcription from the p21 promoter, suggesting that Δ133p53α may be competing with p68 to regulate p53 function. This hypothesis is underscored by our observations that p68 interacts with the C-terminal domain of p53, co-immunoprecipitates 133p53α from cell extracts and interacts only with p53 molecules that are able to form tetramers. These data suggest that p68, p53 and 133p53α may form part of a complex feedback mechanism to regulate the expression of Δ133p53, with consequent modification of p53-mediated transcription, and may modulate the function of p53 in breast and other cancers that harbour wild-type p53."
https://openalex.org/W1979168227,"Regulated intramembrane proteolysis, a highly conserved process employed by diverse regulatory pathways, can release soluble fragments that directly or indirectly modulate gene expression. In this study we used pharmacological tools to identify peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a type I secretory granule membrane protein, as a γ-secretase substrate. PAM, an essential enzyme, catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of the majority of neuropeptides that control metabolic homeostasis. Mass spectroscopy was most consistent with the presence of multiple closely spaced NH(2) termini, suggesting that cleavage occurred near the middle of the PAM transmembrane domain. The luminal domains of PAM must undergo a series of prohormone convertase or α-secretase-mediated cleavages before the remaining transmembrane domain/cytosolic domain fragment can undergo a γ-secretase-like cleavage. Cleavage by γ-secretase generates a soluble fragment of the cytosolic domain (sf-CD) that is known to localize to the nucleus. Although PAM sf-CD is unstable in AtT-20 corticotroph tumor cells, it is readily detected in primary rat anterior pituitary cells. PAM isoform expression, which is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated, affects the efficiency with which sf-CD is produced. sf-CD levels are also modulated by the phosphorylation status of the cytosolic domain and by the ability of the cytosolic domain to interact with cytosolic proteins. sf-CD is produced by primary rat anterior pituitary cells in response to secretogogue, suggesting that sf-CD acts as a signaling molecule relaying information about secretion from the secretory granule to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2055748374,"C-Src is infrequently mutated in human cancers but it mediates oncogenic signals of many activated growth factor receptors and thus remains a key target for cancer therapy. However, the broad function of Src in many cell types and processes requires evaluation of Src-targeted therapeutics within a normal developmental and immune-competent environment. In an effort to understand the appropriate clinical use of Src inhibitors, we tested an Src inhibitor, SKI-606 (bosutinib), in the MMTV-PyVmT transgenic mouse model of breast cancer. Tumor formation in this model is dependent on the presence of Src, but the necessity of Src kinase activity for tumor formation has not been determined. Furthermore, Src inhibitors have not been examined in an autochthonous tumor model that permits assessment of effects on different stages of tumor progression. Here we show that oral administration of SKI-606 inhibited the phosphorylation of Src in mammary tumors and caused a rapid decrease in the Ezh2 Polycomb group histone H3K27 methyltransferase and an increase in epithelial organization. SKI-606 prevented the appearance of palpable tumors in over 50% of the animals and stopped tumor growth in older animals with pre-existing tumors. These antitumor effects were accompanied by decreased cellular proliferation, altered tumor blood vessel organization and dramatically increased differentiation to lactational and epidermal cell fates. SKI-606 controls the development of mammary tumors by inducing differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1986179699,"Reduced bone mass is a common complication in chronic inflammatory diseases, although the mechanisms are not completely understood. The PHEX gene encodes a zinc endopeptidase expressed in osteoblasts and contributes to bone mineralization. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism involved in TNF-mediated down-regulation of Phex gene transcription. We demonstrate down-regulation of the Phex gene in two models of colitis: naive T-cell transfer and in gnotobiotic IL-10−/− mice. In vitro, TNF decreased expression of Phex in UMR106 cells and did not require de novo synthesis of a transrepressor. Transfecting UMR-106 cells with a series of deletion constructs of the proximal Phex promoter identified a region located within −74 nucleotides containing NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites. After TNF treatment, the RelA/p50 NF-κB complex interacted with two cis-elements at positions −70/−66 and −29/−25 nucleotides in the proximal Phex promoter. Inhibition of NF-κB signaling increased the basal level of Phex transcription and abrogated the effects of TNF, whereas overexpression of RelA mimicked the effect of TNF. We identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) binding immediately upstream of the NF-κB sites and showed that TNF induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of RelA when bound to the Phex promoter. TNF-mediated Phex down-regulation was completely abrogated in vitro by PARP-1 inhibitor and overexpression of poly(ADP-ribose) glucohydrolase (PARG) and in vivo in PARP-1−/− mice.

IntroductionBones have several physiological functions including maintaining organism structure, serving as a hematopoietic niche, calcium and inorganic phosphate reservoir, and regulating and feeding back to other organs via hormone release. To balance both normal serum mineral concentrations and bone mineral density, bones have a dynamic homeostasis that involve bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. This balance is influenced by hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines that act directly on osteoblasts and osteoclasts to affect mineral deposition and release (1Caetano-Lopes J. Canhão H. Fonseca J.E. Autoimmun. Rev. 2009; 8: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Although normal bone structure is the result of the balance of these two opposite processes, certain genetic disorders can skew this balance leading to low bone mineralization. In vitamin D-resistant, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, an inactivating mutation of PHEX 3The abbreviations used are: PHEXphosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosomeIBDinflammatory bowel diseasePARP-1poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1PARGpoly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolaseDAPADNA affinity precipitation assayRNAP IIRNA polymerase IITSStranscriptional start site3-AB3-aminobenzamidecLβLclasto-lactacystin-β-lactonentnucleotide(s)SPFspecific pathogen freeNPnuclear proteinCHXcycloheximideICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule 1PMPparamagnetic particlesKOknock-out.

Genet. 1997; 6: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the Phex gene encodes a membrane-bound, zinc metallopeptidase expressed only in osteoblasts and odontoblasts, the effects of its mutation lead to phosphate wasting in the kidney by decreasing the expression and activity of the Na+/Pi cotransporter, NaPi-IIa (NPT2; SLC24A1) in proximal convoluted tubules (4Collins J.F. Scheving L.A. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1995; 269: F439-F448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tenenhouse H.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Phex inactivation was postulated to indirectly affect the kidney through bone-released, phosphaturic factors known as phosphatonins. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was one of the leading phosphatonin candidates due to its potent negative effects on renal phosphate reabsorption and its highly elevated expression in X-linked hypophosphatemic ricket patients (6Kiela P.R. Ghishan F.K. Lab. Invest. 2009; 89: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although initial studies seemed to confirm this mechanism (7Bowe A.E. Finnegan R. Jan de Beur S.M. Cho J. Levine M.A. Kumar R. Schiavi S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), it was later shown that Phex mutations lead to increased FGF23 expression rather than processing (8Liu S. Guo R. Simpson L.G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37419-37426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and that FGF23 is cleaved by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases and not PHEX (9Benet-Pagès A. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Zischka H. White K.E. Econs M.J. Strom T.M. Bone. 2004; 35: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).In addition to the renal abnormalities in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, PHEX inactivation also leads to osteoblast mineralization deficits. This is exemplified by the inability of immortalized osteoblasts from Phex-deficient Hyp mice to mineralize in vitro (10Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the target(s) of PHEX proteolytic activity remains uncertain, PHEX protein may influence bone metabolism by binding and stabilizing matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, dentine matrix protein 1 (DMP1) (11Martin A. David V. Laurence J.S. Schwarz P.M. Lafer E.M. Hedge A.M. Rowe P.S. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 1757-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and osteopontin (12Addison W. Masica D. Gray J. McKee M.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Specifically, when PHEX binds to these substrates, it prevents their cleavage and release of a small, acidic protease-resistant ASARM peptide (acidic serine-aspartate-rich matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein-associated motif). These ASARM peptides have been shown to inhibit mineralization in vivo and in vitro, and most likely function by directly binding to hydroxyapatite crystals and by decreasing the expression of Phex (13Addison W.N. Nakano Y. Loisel T. Crine P. McKee M.D. J. Bone Miner Res. 2008; 23: 1638-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).PHEX itself is regulated by several hormones and cytokines important for skeletal homeostasis. Phex is up-regulated after treatment with insulin-like growth factor 1, growth hormone (14Zoidis E. Gosteli-Peter M. Ghirlanda-Keller C. Meinel L. Zapf J. Schmid C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 146: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and glucocorticoids (15Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Jones M.D. Serey S.H. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol.

Bone. 2005; 37: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), parathyroid hormone-related peptide (17Vargas M.A. St-Louis M. Desgroseillers L. Charli J.L. Boileau G. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4876-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and vitamin D (18Hines E.R. Kolek O.I. Jones M.D. Serey S.H. Sirjani N.B. Kiela P.R. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R.

Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), an observation with significant pathophysiological implications. During chronic inflammation such as in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), circulating and/or infiltrating lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells produce cytokines that can influence bone metabolism by altering the balance of bone mineral deposition and resorption. Decreased bone mineral density is a common outcome of IBD. Indeed, 31 to 59% of adult IBD patients are classified as osteopenic, whereas 5 to 41% are actually diagnosed with osteoporosis, although rates of up to 70% of adult and pediatric IBD patients with low bone mineral density have been reported (20Rodríguez-Bores L. Barahona-Garrido J. Yamamoto-Furusho J.K. World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 6156-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In our earlier study (19Uno J.K. Kolek O.I. Hines E.R. Xu H. Timmermann B.N. Kiela P.R. Ghishan F.K. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we showed that TNF treatment and chemically induced colitis decrease Phex mRNA expression via a transcriptional mechanism, and that the polyadenine (poly(A)) region located −116 to −110 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site was necessary for the TNF-mediated inhibition. This decrease in Phex expression correlated with decreased mineral deposition in osteoblast-like UMR-106 cells.In the present work, we extend our previous observations to demonstrate the down-regulation of Phex in two more representative models of human IBD: microflora-induced colitis in gnotobiotic IL-10−/− mice and adoptive CD4+CD45RBhigh T-cell transfer into Rag2−/− recipients. Phex gene promoter analysis showed that the polyadenine (poly(A)) region in the murine Phex promoter constitutively binds PARP-1, whereas TNF induces binding of the NF-κB complex proximally to this element. RelA is then PARylated to increase its activity as a transrepressor. PARP-1 activity was indispensable for the effects of TNF as demonstrated by a blunted response to the cytokine in the presence of a PARP-1 inhibitor or overexpressed poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), and by a complete abrogation of the response to TNF in PARP-1 knock-out mice.DISCUSSIONThe skeletal and immune systems share numerous key players and regulatory mechanisms, an overlap that gave rise to the emerging field of osteoimmunology. A detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of bone destruction as a result of the interaction of immune cells and inflammatory mediators with bone cells is critical in designing novel strategies for the treatment of several disorders. These include rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, Paget disease, osteoarthritis, multiple myeloma, metastatic bone tumors, and chronic inflammation-associated loss of bone mineral density. The latter is increasingly more recognized by the gastroenterology community due to a significant association of chronic IBD with osteopenia and osteoporosis (25Tilg H. Moschen A.R. Kaser A. Pines A. Dotan I. Gut. 2008; 57: 684-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Bone loss in chronic inflammation is believed to be at least in part mediated by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, or IFN-γ. Although TNF has been believed to affect bone primarily by causing osteoclast-driven bone erosion, newer data points to a direct effect of inflammatory mediators on the osteoblast functions as well. Defective bone formation has been reported not only in animal models of IBD (26Dresner-Pollak R. Gelb N. Rachmilewitz D. Karmeli F. Weinreb M. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 792-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) but also in pediatric Crohn's disease patients (27Hyams J.S. Wyzga N. Kreutzer D.L. Justinich C.J. Gronowicz G.A. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1997; 24: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Serum from children with Crohn's disease decreases osteoblast function including bone nodule formation in vitro (28Varghese S. Wyzga N. Griffiths A.M. Sylvester F.A. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2002; 35: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The Phex gene encodes a M13 family of zinc metalloendopeptidase expressed primarily in osteoblasts and odontoblasts. Phenotypically, inborn inactivating mutations in the PHEX gene result in vitamin D resistant, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, whereas in vitro, the expression of Phex is a prerequisite for bone matrix deposition (6Kiela P.R. Ghishan F.K. Lab. Invest. 2009; 89: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We described earlier that chemically induced colitis results in a TNF-mediated decrease in bone Phex expression, and that in vitro exposure of osteoblasts to TNF results in a corresponding decreases of Phex mRNA and protein and a mineralizing defect (19Uno J.K. Kolek O.I. Hines E.R. Xu H. Timmermann B.N. Kiela P.R. Ghishan F.K. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this report we confirm these observations in more relevant IBD models offered by gnotobiotic IL-10−/− mice and by the naive T-cell transfer, and we identify the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, which likely contributes to dysfunction of osteoblast activity and bone formation in patients with chronic IBD. According to this model, TNF treatment results in the recruitment of the p65/p50 NF-κB complex to two relatively weak cis-elements located at nt −76/−57 and −35/−16 between the Phex transcription start site and a poly(A) element located upstream of the NF-κB sites. Through proteomic and molecular approaches we identified the poly(A)-binding protein as PARP-1, an enzyme participating in TNF-inducible parylation of the p65 (RelA) subunit, likely increasing the affinity of the NF-κB complex to the proximal Phex promoter, resulting in increased retention and inhibited clearance of the RNA polymerase II complex.The obtained results highlight the importance of Phex in osteoblast function during chronic inflammatory conditions, but also the significance of NF-κB activity and the modulating role of PARP-1 in osteoblast function. It also identifies PARP-1 as a potential target in mitigating IBD-associated bone loss. Recent studies using transgenic mice bearing dominant-negative IKK-γ targeted to mature osteoblasts by the bone γ-carboxyglutamate protein-2 (Bglap2) promoter have demonstrated the anti-mineralizing effects of NF-κB (29Chang J. Wang Z. Tang E. Fan Z. McCauley L. Franceschi R. Guan K. Krebsbach P.H. Wang C.Y. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These mice manifested enhanced bone formation with elevated expression of bone matrix genes such as α-1 type 1 collagen, osteocalcin, secreted phosphoprotein-1, and bone sialoprotein. Studies with these transgenic mice also demonstrated that NF-κB is constitutively active, albeit to a lesser extent, under basal conditions (29Chang J. Wang Z. Tang E. Fan Z. McCauley L. Franceschi R. Guan K. Krebsbach P.H. Wang C.Y. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our results that examined mouse promoter activity in UMR-106 cells in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor cLβL. These experiments showed that cLβL alone significantly increases Phex mRNA expression. More importantly, the results from our studies and the IKK dominant-negative transgenic mouse study strongly suggest that targeting NF-κB in the treatment of osteoporosis and inflammatory bone loss will not only result in suppression of bone resorption but also in promotion of bone formation, thus facilitating the rebuilding of bone mass.It is important to note, however, that the role of NF-κB in IBD is very complex and its pleiotropic roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival, inflammation, and carcinogenesis do not make it an easy target for systemic approach (30Karrasch T. Jobin C. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2008; 14: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Identifying PARP-1 as a crucial modulator of NF-κB activity in the osteoblasts opens an alternative possibility of targeting PARP-1. Several lines of evidence suggests that PARP-1 could be a suitable pharmacological target, particularly in IBD. (a) PARP-1 has been shown to participate in triggering the NF-κB pathway, affecting both the classical pathway and the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic DNA damage-induced NF-κB pathway. In the classical pathway, PARP-1 was shown to participate in LPS-induced monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression (31Oumouna-Benachour K. Hans C.P. Suzuki Y. Naura A. Datta R. Belmadani S. Fallon K. Woods C. Boulares A.H. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2442-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas in vascular smooth muscle cells PARP-1 was critical for TNF-induced expression of ICAM-1 (but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) and shown to physically interact with p65 (RelA) (32Zerfaoui M. Suzuki Y. Naura A.S. Hans C.P. Nichols C. Boulares A.H. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the nuclear to cytoplasmic DNA damage-induced NF-κB pathway PARP-1 contributes to the physical assembly of the nuclear signalsome including IKKγ, PIASy (nuclear matrix-associated SUMO E3 ligase), and ATM (protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated) (33Stilmann M. Hinz M. Arslan S.C. Zimmer A. Schreiber V. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 365-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). (b) Modulating PARP-1 expression or enzymatic activity has been shown in numerous studies to ameliorate the symptoms of experimental colitis (34Zingarelli B. Hake P.W. Burroughs T.J. Piraino G. O'Connor M. Denenberg A. Immunology. 2004; 113: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35Sánchez-Fidalgo S. Villegas I. Martín A. Sánchez-Hidalgo M. Alarcón de la Lastra C. Eur. J.

Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G641-G651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although PARP-1 is an abundant and ubiquitous nuclear enzyme originally identified as a key factor in the DNA repair pathway, it has now been shown to positively and negatively affect gene transcription and chromatin structure under both basal and signal-activated conditions (40Nguewa P.A. Fuertes M.A. Valladares B. Alonso C. Pérez J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 143-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Studies examining gene expression profiles in PARP-1-deficient embryonic stem cells and liver cells from PARP-1 KO mice showed that 3.5% of the transcriptome were regulated by PARP-1, 70% of which were positively regulated (41Ogino H. Nozaki T. Gunji A. Maeda M. Suzuki H. Ohta T. Murakami Y. Nakagama H. Sugimura T. Masutani M. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). More notably, PARP-1 has been described as one of the major molecules involved in the propagation of inflammatory stimuli and has been proposed as a target for anti-inflammatory treatment (42Peralta-Leal A. Rodríguez-Vargas J.M. Aguilar-Quesada R. Rodríguez M.I. Linares J.L. de Almodóvar M.R. Oliver F.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PARP-1 has been shown to affect gene transcription in several ways: as an enhancer-binding factor similar to classical sequence-specific DNA-binding activators or repressors, as a transcriptional co-regulator, or as a modifying enzyme that catalyzes the NAD+-dependent addition of ADP(ribose) polymers (PARylation) to several nuclear proteins. We demonstrate here that in TNF-treated osteoblasts, RelA is translocated to the nucleus, where it is PARylated by PARP-1. This chemical modification is critical for TNF-induced inhibition of Phex expression because this response does not occur in PARP-1-deficient mice and is reversed by the PARP-1 inhibitor 3-AB or by an overexpression of PARG. Although it is technically challenging to determine whether PARP-1 and RelA physically interact with each other in the context of the Phex gene promoter, the proximity of their binding sites and inducible recruitment of RelA suggest such a possibility.Interestingly, we initially described the Phex poly(A) promoter region as a positive cis-element whose affinity for a 110 kDa, then unidentified binding protein was decreased in response to dihydroxy-vitamin D treatment (29Chang J. Wang Z. Tang E. Fan Z. McCauley L. Franceschi R. Guan K. Krebsbach P.H. Wang C.Y. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of the effects of vitamin D on PARP-1 in osteoblasts requires further work, our findings suggest that PARP-1 may play a pleiotropic role in the regulation of Phex gene transcription, depending on the physiological or pathophysiological context.In conclusion, our results describe a new mechanism of TNF-mediated gene regulation in osteoblasts involving NF-κB and PARP-1. Cooperatively, NF-κB signaling and PARP-1 enzymatic activity constitutively and inducibly suppress Phex gene expression. IntroductionBones have several physiological functions including maintaining organism structure, serving as a hematopoietic niche, calcium and inorganic phosphate reservoir, and regulating and feeding back to other organs via hormone release. To balance both normal serum mineral concentrations and bone mineral density, bones have a dynamic homeostasis that involve bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. This balance is influenced by hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines that act directly on osteoblasts and osteoclasts to affect mineral deposition and release (1Caetano-Lopes J. Canhão H. Fonseca J.E. Autoimmun. Rev. 2009; 8: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Although normal bone structure is the result of the balance of these two opposite processes, certain genetic disorders can skew this balance leading to low bone mineralization. In vitamin D-resistant, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, an inactivating mutation of PHEX 3The abbreviations used are: PHEXphosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosomeIBDinflammatory bowel diseasePARP-1poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1PARGpoly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolaseDAPADNA affinity precipitation assayRNAP IIRNA polymerase IITSStranscriptional start site3-AB3-aminobenzamidecLβLclasto-lactacystin-β-lactonentnucleotide(s)SPFspecific pathogen freeNPnuclear proteinCHXcycloheximideICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule 1PMPparamagnetic particlesKOknock-out. (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome) leads to hypophosphatemia, aberrant vitamin D levels, high serum alkaline phosphatase, and osteomalacia (2Francis F.

Genet. 1997; 6: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although the Phex gene encodes a membrane-bound, zinc metallopeptidase expressed only in osteoblasts and odontoblasts, the effects of its mutation lead to phosphate wasting in the kidney by decreasing the expression and activity of the Na+/Pi cotransporter, NaPi-IIa (NPT2; SLC24A1) in proximal convoluted tubules (4Collins J.F.

Nutr. 2005; 25: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Phex inactivation was postulated to indirectly affect the kidney through bone-released, phosphaturic factors known as phosphatonins. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was one of the leading phosphatonin candidates due to its potent negative effects on renal phosphate reabsorption and its highly elevated expression in X-linked hypophosphatemic ricket patients (6Kiela P.R. Ghishan F.K. Lab. Invest. 2009; 89: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although initial studies seemed to confirm this mechanism (7Bowe A.E. Finnegan R. Jan de Beur S.M. Cho J. Levine M.A. Kumar R. Schiavi S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), it was later shown that Phex mutations lead to increased FGF23 expression rather than processing (8Liu S. Guo R. Simpson L.G. Xiao Z.S. Burnham C.E. Quarles L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37419-37426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and that FGF23 is cleaved by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases and not PHEX (9Benet-Pagès A. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Zischka H. White K.E. Econs M.J. Strom T.M. Bone. 2004; 35: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).In addition to the renal abnormalities in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, PHEX inactivation also leads to osteoblast mineralization deficits. This is exemplified by the inability of immortalized osteoblasts from Phex-deficient Hyp mice to mineralize in vitro (10Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the target(s) of PHEX proteolytic activity remains uncertain, PHEX protein may influence bone metabolism by binding and stabilizing matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, dentine matrix protein 1 (DMP1) (11Martin A. David V. Laurence J.S. Schwarz P.M. Lafer E.M. Hedge A.M. Rowe P.S. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 1757-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and osteopontin (12Addison W. Masica D. Gray J. McKee M.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Specifically, when PHEX binds to these substrates, it prevents their cleavage and release of a small, acidic protease-resistant ASARM peptide (acidic serine-aspartate-rich matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein-associated motif). These ASARM peptides have been shown to inhibit mineralization in vivo and in vitro, and most likely function by directly binding to hydroxyapatite crystals and by decreasing the expression of Phex (13Addison W.N. Nakano Y. Loisel T. Crine P. McKee M.D. J. Bone Miner Res. 2008; 23: 1638-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).PHEX itself is regulated by several hormones and cytokines important for skeletal homeostasis. Phex is up-regulated after treatment with insulin-like growth factor 1, growth hormone (14Zoidis E. Gosteli-Peter M. Ghirlanda-Keller C. Meinel L. Zapf J. Schmid C. Eur. J.

LMIR7 shares high homology with LMIR4 in the amino acid sequences of its Ig-like and transmembrane domains. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that LMIR4 was predominantly expressed in neutrophils, whereas LMIR7 was highly expressed in mast cells and monocytes/macrophages. Importantly, LMIR7 engagement induced cytokine production in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Although FcRγ deficiency did not affect surface expression levels of LMIR7, it abolished LMIR7-mediated activation of BMMCs. Consistently we found significant interaction of LMIR7-FcRγ, albeit with lower affinity compared with that of LMIR4-FcRγ. Our results showed that LMIR7 transmits an activating signal through interaction with FcRγ. In addition, like LMIR4, LMIR7 synergizes with TLR4 in signaling. Analysis of several chimera receptors composed of LMIR4 and LMIR7 revealed these findings: 1) the transmembrane of LMIR7 with no charged residues maintained its surface expression at high levels in the absence of FcRγ; 2) the extracellular juxtamembrane region of LMIR7 had a negative effect on its surface expression levels; and 3) the strong interaction of LMIR4 with FcRγ depended on the extracellular juxtamembrane region as well as the transmembrane domain of LMIR4. Thus, LMIR7 shares similarities with LMIR4, although they are differentially regulated in their distribution, expression, and function.

An inhibitory receptor, LMIR3/CLM-1, pairs with an activating receptor, LMIR4/CLM-5 or LMIR5/CLM-7. LMIR3 is 91 and 53% identical with LMIR4 and LMIR5, respectively, in the amino acid sequence of the Ig-like domain.

In the present study, we have characterized LMIR7/CLM-3, which had not been fully analyzed. Structurally, LMIR7 is similar to LMIR4 in its Ig-like and transmembrane domains. The generation of an antibody specifically reacting with LMIR7 enabled us to delineate the differential expression profiles of LMIR7 and LMIR4. Importantly, LMIR7 engagement led to the activation of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) through interaction with FcRγ, validating an activating function of LMIR7 similar to that of LMIR4. Notably, analysis of chimera receptors composed of LMIR4 and LMIR7 revealed that a short extracellular juxtamembrane region of LMIR4 played an important role in its strong interaction with FcRγ. This finding will likely lead us to uncover novel regulatory mechanisms in the interaction of a diverse array of activating receptors with FcRγ.

https://openalex.org/W2023564055,"Current mouse models do not reflect the sporadic nature of colon cancer and do not allow the analysis of antitumor immune response because of the lack of known tumor-specific antigens. Two transgenic mouse models with spontaneous tumor development were generated, directing the expression of SV40T antigen (Tag) either constitutively (Vil-Cre × LoxP-Tag-transgenic mice) or stochastically (Vil-Cre-ER(T2) × LoxP-Tag-transgenic mice) into the putative stem cell region of the crypt of Lieberkühn. Tumor development and antitumor immune response were monitored. Vil-Cre × LoxP-Tag mice developed multiple adenocarcinomas of the small intestine and colon at an average age of 6 months. During the tumor development, Tag-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were induced in half of the mice, although they had developed neonatal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) tolerance. This model shows similarity to hereditary colon cancer but not to the sporadic tumor development. Therefore, the conditional Vil-Cre-ER(T2) × LoxP-Tag mice were established, in which expression of the dormant Tag was induced by stochastic, tissue-specific activation of Cre recombinase. These mice spontaneously developed highly invasive, metastasizing colon carcinomas at an average age of 20 months. Colon carcinomas expressed epithelial and/or neuroendocrine markers depending on the grade of differentiation. Young Vil-Cre-ER(T2) × LoxP-Tag mice had retained CTL responses against epitope IV of Tag. The tumors induced strong anti-Tag IgG responses. We report, for the first time, a mouse model based on stochastic, tissue-specific activation of a dormant oncogene in the colon allowing the analysis of antitumor immune response against primary colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2090500092,"Background Human APPL1 and APPL2 are homologous RAB5 effectors whose binding partners include a diverse set of transmembrane receptors, signaling proteins, and phosphoinositides. APPL proteins associate dynamically with endosomal membranes and are proposed to function in endosome-mediated signaling pathways linking the cell surface to the cell nucleus. APPL proteins contain an N-terminal Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, a central pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. Previous structural and biochemical studies have shown that the APPL BAR domains mediate homotypic and heterotypic APPL-APPL interactions and that the APPL1 BAR domain forms crescent-shaped dimers. Although previous studies have shown that APPL minimal BAR domains associate with curved cell membranes, direct interaction between APPL BAR domains on cell membranes in vivo has not been reported. Methodology Herein, we used a laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a spectral detector to carry out fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments with cyan fluorescent protein/yellow fluorescent protein (CFP/YFP) FRET donor/acceptor pairs to examine interactions between APPL minimal BAR domains at the subcellular level. This comprehensive approach enabled us to evaluate FRET levels in a single cell using three methods: sensitized emission, standard acceptor photobleaching, and sequential acceptor photobleaching. We also analyzed emission spectra to address an outstanding controversy regarding the use of CFP donor/YFP acceptor pairs in FRET acceptor photobleaching experiments, based on reports that photobleaching of YFP converts it into a CFP-like species. Conclusions All three methods consistently showed significant FRET between APPL minimal BAR domain FRET pairs, indicating that they interact directly in a homotypic (i.e., APPL1-APPL1 and APPL2-APPL2) and heterotypic (i.e., APPL1-APPL2) manner on curved cell membranes. Furthermore, the results of our experiments did not show photoconversion of YFP into a CFP-like species following photobleaching, supporting the use of CFP donor/YFP acceptor FRET pairs in acceptor photobleaching studies."
https://openalex.org/W1970600179,"Neuronal dendrites are vulnerable to injury under diverse pathological conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms for dendritic Na(+) overload and the selective dendritic injury remain poorly understood. Our current study demonstrates that activation of NHE-1 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1) in dendrites presents a major pathway for Na(+) overload. Neuronal dendrites exhibited higher pH(i) regulation rates than soma as a result of a larger surface area/volume ratio. Following a 2-h oxygen glucose deprivation and a 1-h reoxygenation, NHE-1 activity was increased by ∼70-200% in dendrites. This elevation depended on activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase. Moreover, stimulation of NHE-1 caused dendritic Na(+)(i) accumulation, swelling, and a concurrent loss of Ca(2+)(i) homeostasis. The Ca(2+)(i) overload in dendrites preceded the changes in soma. Inhibition of NHE-1 or the reverse mode of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange prevented these changes. Mitochondrial membrane potential in dendrites depolarized 40 min earlier than soma following oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Blocking NHE-1 activity not only attenuated loss of dendritic mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis but also preserved dendritic membrane integrity. Taken together, our study demonstrates that NHE-1-mediated Na(+) entry and subsequent Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange activation contribute to the selective dendritic vulnerability to in vitro ischemia."

https://openalex.org/W1975778448,"Intermediate filaments (IFs) assembled in vitro from recombinantly expressed proteins have a diameter of 8-12 nm and can reach several micrometers in length. IFs assemble from a soluble pool of subunits, tetramers in the case of vimentin. Upon salt addition, the subunits form first unit length filaments (ULFs) within seconds and then assembly proceeds further by end-to-end fusion of ULFs and short filaments. So far, IF subunits have mainly been observed by electron microscopy of glycerol sprayed and rotary metal shadowed specimens. Due to the shear forces during spraying the IF subunits appear generally as straight thin rods. In this study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM), cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) combined with molecular modeling to investigate the conformation of the subunits of vimentin, desmin and keratin K5/K14 IFs in various conditions. Due to their anisotropic shape the subunits are difficult to image at high resolution by cryo-EM. In order to enhance contrast we used a cryo-negative staining approach. The subunits were clearly identified as thin, slightly curved rods. However the staining agent also forced the subunits to aggregate into two-dimensional networks of dot-like structures. To test this conformational change further, we imaged dried unfixed subunits on mica by AFM revealing a mixture of extended and dot-like conformations. The use of divalent ions such as calcium and magnesium, as well as glutaraldehyde exposure favored compact conformations over elongated ones. These experimental results as well as coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a vimentin tetramer highlight the plasticity of IF subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1978548976,"IRF-1 is a tumor suppressor protein that activates gene expression from a range of promoters in response to stimuli spanning viral infection to DNA damage. Studies on the post-translational regulation of IRF-1 have been hampered by a lack of suitable biochemical tools capable of targeting the endogenous protein. In this study, phage display technology was used to develop a monoclonal nanobody targeting the C-terminal Mf1 domain (residues 301–325) of IRF-1. Intracellular expression of the nanobody demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of IRF-1 is constrained by the Mf1 domain as nanobody binding gave an increase in expression from IRF-1-responsive promoters of up to 8-fold. Furthermore, Mf1-directed nanobodies have revealed an unexpected function for this domain in limiting the rate at which the IRF-1 protein is degraded. Thus, the increase in IRF-1 transcriptional activity observed on nanobody binding is accompanied by a significant reduction in the half-life of the protein. In support of the data obtained using nanobodies, a single point mutation (P325A) involving the C-terminal residue of IRF-1 has been identified, which results in greater transcriptional activity and a significant increase in the rate of degradation. The results presented here support a role for the Mf1 domain in limiting both IRF-1-dependent transcription and the rate of IRF-1 turnover.

More recently, the loss of exons 7–9 in various combinations has been reported in cervical cancer, and this leads to the generation of C-terminally truncated IRF-1 that can compete with the wild-type protein for DNA binding. The C-terminal mutants have longer half-lives and, unlike wild-type IRF-1, can be expressed in a cell cycle independent manner (4Lee E.J. Jo M. Park J. Zhang W. Lee J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Understanding the function of the Mf1 domain of IRF-1, a regulatory subdomain that is located at the C terminus of the protein, could therefore increase our current knowledge of the role that truncated proteins play in tumor progression.The extreme C-terminal region of IRF-1 (Mf1 domain; amino acids 301–325) is a regulatory domain that plays a role in both positive and negative modulation of target gene expression (5Eckert M. Meek S.E. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23092-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, the Mf1 domain plays a role in determining the rate of IRF-1 protein degradation, with removal of the C terminus leading to a significant increase in the half-life of the protein (6Pion E. Narayan V. Eckert M. Ball K.L. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Nakagawa K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of members of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones to the Mf1 domain appears to be critical for the normal function and regulation of IRF-1 (8Narayan V. Eckert M. Zylicz A.

Thus previous studies have pointed to a potentially important role for the Mf1 domain of IRF-1 in its homeostatic regulation.The studies described above, by necessity, relied on the use of exogenous IRF-1 mutant proteins; therefore, we do not know whether the Mf1 domain is rate-limiting for IRF-1-mediated gene activation within the context of the endogenous protein. To address this issue, we have used antibody phage display to screen for scFv 3The abbreviations used are: scFvsingle chain variable fragmentNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidTRAILtumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligandISREinterferon-stimulated response elementEGFPenhanced GFPPKRprotein kinase RNA-activated. antibody fragments (9Smith G.P.

Nature. 1990; 348: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar) to the Mf1 domain. The introduction of scFv nanobodies into a cell system showed that the Mf1 domain was rate-limiting for IRF-1-mediated transcription under normal cellular conditions, providing good evidence that IRF-1 transcriptional function is subject to post-translational regulation. The data also highlight an unexpected role for the extreme C terminus in the negative regulation of IRF-1 turnover.DISCUSSIONData are presented suggesting that the Mf1 domain of IRF-1 limits its ability to activate transcription and that this negative regulation can be relieved using nanobodies that bind to the Mf1 domain or by mutating the C-terminal residue of the protein (Pro325). In addition, the data highlight a possible role for the Mf1 domain in coordinating a link between the rate of IRF-1 degradation and its transcriptional activity. Previous studies have suggested that IRF-1 activity is regulated primarily at the level of transcription as IRF-1 steady state levels increase in response to agents such as interferon and DNA damage, which induce its transcriptional activity (3Willman C.L. Sever C.E. Pallavicini M.G. Harada H. Tanaka N. Slovak M.L. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Meeker T.C. List A.F. et al.Science. 1993; 259: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 25Romeo G. Fiorucci G. Chiantore M.V. Percario Z.A. Vannucchi S. Affabris E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrate here that IRF-1 is also subject to post-translational regulation; it is held in a latent or partially active state, and activity can be induced in the absence of an increase in its steady state levels.The Mf1 domain is a 25-amino acid region in the extreme C terminus of IRF-1, which appears to be a “hot spot” for the regulation of both its function and turnover. Thus, the Mf1 domain has been shown to house an LXXLL coregulator signature motif (amino acids 306–310), which is essential for IRF-1-mediated repression of Cdk2 (5Eckert M. Meek S.E. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23092-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and a binding site for members of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones that play a role in maintaining the normal cellular function of IRF-1 (8Narayan V. Eckert M. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25889-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Mf1 domain lies within a region originally defined as an enhancer region (amino acids 257–325) required for maximal IRF-1 transcriptional activity (26Kirchhoff S. Oumard A. Nourbakhsh M. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6753-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that most likely functions through the recruitment of coactivators such as p300 (27Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). More detailed analysis of the IRF-1 C terminus has revealed that removal of the last 25 residues, rather than the entire enhancer domain, does not compromise its ability to activate gene expression. Rather a ΔC-terminal 25-residue IRF-1 truncation mutant displayed an increase in intrinsic transactivation potential when compared with the full-length protein (Fig. 5) (5Eckert M. Meek S.E. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23092-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This suggests that the extreme C terminus, later named multifunctional-1 (Mf1) domain (8Narayan V. Eckert M. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25889-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), might be a negative regulator of IRF-1 activity. As these studies relied on the use of transiently expressed IRF-1 mutant proteins, it has not been possible to determine the effect of the Mf1 domain on IRF-1 as a transcriptional activator under normal cellular conditions. By developing a nanobody that can bind to both endogenous and exogenous IRF-1, we have been able to demonstrate that the Mf1 domain is normally rate-limiting for IRF-1-mediated gene expression. The data presented in this study are in good agreement with our previous observations using Ala scanning and a series of truncation mutants to narrow down the possible negative regulatory domain (5Eckert M. Meek S.E. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23092-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to amino acids 311–317. As the scFv3 interaction with IRF-1 requires both Tyr311 and Ser317 (Fig. 4), its activation of IRF-1-mediated gene expression lends strong support to the idea that these residues include a negative regulatory motif (5Eckert M. Meek S.E. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23092-23102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that single chain nanobodies can be used to modulate the function of their target antigens in a cellular environment by, for example, altering the intracellular localization of the target proteins (18Cossins A.J.

Biotechnol. 2008; 135: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, the scFv3 nanobody was able to activate IRF-1-mediated transcription between 4- and 8-fold making it a powerful tool to study the functions of the Mf1 domain in a cell system. Conventional monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies have been used previously to study a negative regulatory domain in p53. Monoclonals and scFv, which bind to the 421 epitope, have been used to explore the role of the p53 C-terminal domain in negative regulation of its DNA binding and transcriptional activity (36Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 37Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 38Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, 421 antibody-based scFvs have been suggested as a way to partially reactivate mutant forms of the p53 protein in cells (39Caron de Fromentel C. Gruel N. Venot C. Debussche L. Conseiller E. Dureuil C. Teillaud J.L. Tocque B. Bracco L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mechanism of p53 activation by 421 antibodies is through an increase in the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of the protein. In this study, we found no evidence for an increased DNA binding activity of IRF-1 in the presence of scFv3 (Fig. 3e) nor was there any obvious difference in the subcellular localization of IRF-1 when bound to the activating nanobody (Fig. 7a). Nanobody binding may impact on the conformation/dynamics of the IRF-1 structure or attenuate inhibition mediated via an intramolecular interaction. The IRF-1-related protein IRF-3 is subject to this type of regulation. In the case of IRF-3, autoinhibition occurs due to an interaction between the C terminus and a region from the N-terminal domain (40Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and this process is regulated by C-terminal phosphorylation (41Yang H. Lin C.H. Ma G. Orr M. Baffi M.O. Wathelet M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, structural information is only available for the DNA binding domain of IRF-1 (42Escalante C.R. Yie J. Thanos D. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and how the Mf1 domain relates to the overall tertiary structure of the protein remains to be determined. It is also possible that the Mf1 domain can act as an allosteric modulatory site in response to C-terminal binding proteins. To date, few IRF-1 interactions have been documented, and the number of proteins known to interact with the C terminus is even more limited. However, Hsp70 family members have recently been identified as physiologically relevant Mf1 interacting factors that impact on IRF-1 localization, transcriptional activity, and its rate of degradation (8Narayan V. Eckert M. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25889-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggesting that the activity of IRF-1 is likely to be modulated by agents that mimic or disrupt Mf1 protein-protein interactions.Increased IRF-1 degradation upon scFv3 binding (Fig. 7, b–d) seems contrary to our previous observation that the Mf1 domain is required for efficient IRF-1 turnover (6Pion E. Narayan V. Eckert M. Ball K.L. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the Pro325 IRF-1 mutant protein displays a similar property as it has a reduced t0.5 compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 8b). As nanobody epitope mapping (Fig. 4) shows that scFv3 also has a strong requirement for Pro325, its effect on degradation seems unlikely to be an artifact. The Mf1 domain therefore appears to contain elements that are both required for efficient degradation of IRF-1 (6Pion E. Narayan V. Eckert M. Ball K.L. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and that prevent the rate of degradation from being too rapid (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8), i.e. the Mf1 can act like a rheostat “fine-tuning” IRF-1 turnover dependent on cellular conditions.Both scFv3-bound IRF-1 and P325A IRF-1 have increased transactivation activity, as well as an increased rate of degradation, making it interesting to speculate that these two Mf1 domain functions may be linked. It is increasingly clear that both the proteolytic and nonproteolytic functions of the proteasome are required for correct regulation of the transcriptional machinery, with evidence of both the 19 S and 26 S proteasomes being associated with chromatin, components of the basal transcription machinery, and/or various transcription factors (43Muratani M.

However, evidence suggests roles for proteasome-mediated degradation in establishing limits for transcription, promoting the exchange of transcription factors on chromatin, and stimulating multiple rounds of transcription initiation (49Gillette T.G.

It will therefore be of interest to determine exactly how changes in the half-life of IRF-1 relate to its function as a transcription factor. IntroductionThe skipping of exon 3 and/or 2 seen in transcripts for the IRF-1 tumor suppressor has been linked to the development of human hemopoietic malignancies, such as leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (1Boultwood J.

https://openalex.org/W2076497672,"Pz-peptidase A, from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus collagenovorans MO-1, hydrolyzes a synthetic peptide substrate, 4-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Arg (Pz-PLGPR), which contains a collagen-specific tripeptide sequence, -Gly-Pro-X-, but does not act on collagen proteins themselves. The mammalian enzyme, thimet oligopeptidase (TOP), which has comparable functions with bacterial Pz-peptidases but limited identity at the primary sequence level, has recently been subjected to x-ray crystallographic analysis; however, no crystal structure has yet been reported for complexes of TOP with substrate analogues. Here, we report crystallization of recombinant Pz-peptidase A in complex with two phosphinic peptide inhibitors (PPIs) that also function as inhibitors of TOP and determination of the crystal structure of these complexes at 1.80-2.00 Å resolution. The most striking difference between Pz-peptidase A and TOP is that there is no channel running the length of bacterial protein. Whereas the structure of TOP resembles an open bivalve, that of Pz-peptidase A is closed and globular. This suggests that collagenous peptide substrates enter the tunnel at the top gateway of the closed Pz-peptidase A molecule, and reactant peptides are released from the bottom gateway after cleavage at the active site located in the center of the tunnel. One of the two PPIs, PPI-2, which contains the collagen-specific sequence, helped to clarify the exquisite structure and reaction mechanism of Pz-peptidase A toward collagenous peptides. This study describes the mode of substrate binding and its implication for the mammalian enzymes."
