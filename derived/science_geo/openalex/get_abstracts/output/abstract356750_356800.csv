https://openalex.org/W1990320777,"Myc is a pleiotropic basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor that coordinates expression of the diverse intracellular and extracellular programs that together are necessary for growth and expansion of somatic cells. In principle, this makes inhibition of Myc an attractive pharmacological approach for treating diverse types of cancer. However, enthusiasm has been muted by lack of direct evidence that Myc inhibition would be therapeutically efficacious, concerns that it would induce serious side effects by inhibiting proliferation of normal tissues, and practical difficulties in designing Myc inhibitory drugs. We have modelled genetically both the therapeutic impact and the side effects of systemic Myc inhibition in a preclinical mouse model of Ras-induced lung adenocarcinoma by reversible, systemic expression of a dominant-interfering Myc mutant. We show that Myc inhibition triggers rapid regression of incipient and established lung tumours, defining an unexpected role for endogenous Myc function in the maintenance of Ras-dependent tumours in vivo. Systemic Myc inhibition also exerts profound effects on normal regenerating tissues. However, these effects are well tolerated over extended periods and rapidly and completely reversible. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of targeting Myc, a common downstream conduit for many oncogenic signals, as an effective, efficient and tumour-specific cancer therapy."

Here we show that mouse embryonic stem cells, cultured without any morphogen but in the presence of a sonic hedgehog inhibitor, recapitulate in vitro the major milestones of cortical development, leading to the sequential generation of a diverse repertoire of neurons that display most salient features of genuine cortical pyramidal neurons. When grafted into the cerebral cortex, these neurons develop patterns of axonal projections corresponding to a wide range of cortical layers, but also to highly specific cortical areas, in particular visual and limbic areas, thereby demonstrating that the identity of a cortical area can be specified without any influence from the brain. The discovery of intrinsic corticogenesis sheds new light on the mechanisms of neuronal specification, and opens new avenues for the modelling and treatment of brain diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1980341499,"The western Amazon is the most biologically rich part of the Amazon basin and is home to a great diversity of indigenous ethnic groups, including some of the world's last uncontacted peoples living in voluntary isolation. Unlike the eastern Brazilian Amazon, it is still a largely intact ecosystem. Underlying this landscape are large reserves of oil and gas, many yet untapped. The growing global demand is leading to unprecedented exploration and development in the region.We synthesized information from government sources to quantify the status of oil development in the western Amazon. National governments delimit specific geographic areas or ""blocks"" that are zoned for hydrocarbon activities, which they may lease to state and multinational energy companies for exploration and production. About 180 oil and gas blocks now cover approximately 688,000 km(2) of the western Amazon. These blocks overlap the most species-rich part of the Amazon. We also found that many of the blocks overlap indigenous territories, both titled lands and areas utilized by peoples in voluntary isolation. In Ecuador and Peru, oil and gas blocks now cover more than two-thirds of the Amazon. In Bolivia and western Brazil, major exploration activities are set to increase rapidly.Without improved policies, the increasing scope and magnitude of planned extraction means that environmental and social impacts are likely to intensify. We review the most pressing oil- and gas-related conservation policy issues confronting the region. These include the need for regional Strategic Environmental Impact Assessments and the adoption of roadless extraction techniques. We also consider the conflicts where the blocks overlap indigenous peoples' territories."
https://openalex.org/W2162648910,"The exclusion of the tumour suppressor PTEN from the cell nucleus has been linked with tumour progression; the mechanisms behind its aberrant localization are obscure, although ubiquitinylation of specific lysines in PTEN is known to regulate PTEN distribution between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Now Min Sup Song identify HAUSP, a deubiquitinating enzyme previously shown to act on the p53 tumour repressor, as the enzyme responsible for PTEN deubiquitination too. This activity is shown to regulate the cellular localization and function of PTEN. This role of HAUSP is antagonized by PML, another tumour suppressor. PML function is disrupted in promeyelocytic leukaemia, and drugs that are effective in treating this form of leukaemia are found to impinge on PTEN function, by affecting PML and HAUSP. Nuclear exclusion of the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) tumour suppressor has been associated with cancer progression1,2,3,4,5,6. However, the mechanisms leading to this aberrant PTEN localization in human cancers are currently unknown. We have previously reported that ubiquitinylation of PTEN at specific lysine residues regulates its nuclear–cytoplasmic partitioning7. Here we show that functional promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies co-ordinate PTEN localization by opposing the action of a previously unknown PTEN-deubiquitinylating enzyme, herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP, also known as USP7), and that the integrity of this molecular framework is required for PTEN to be able to enter the nucleus. We find that PTEN is aberrantly localized in acute promyelocytic leukaemia, in which PML function is disrupted by the PML–RARα fusion oncoprotein. Remarkably, treatment with drugs that trigger PML–RARα degradation, such as all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, restore nuclear PTEN. We demonstrate that PML opposes the activity of HAUSP towards PTEN through a mechanism involving the adaptor protein DAXX (death domain-associated protein). In support of this paradigm, we show that HAUSP is overexpressed in human prostate cancer and is associated with PTEN nuclear exclusion. Thus, our results delineate a previously unknown PML–DAXX–HAUSP molecular network controlling PTEN deubiquitinylation and trafficking, which is perturbed by oncogenic cues in human cancer, in turn defining a new deubiquitinylation-dependent model for PTEN subcellular compartmentalization."
https://openalex.org/W2033651349,"DNA can be repaired by two fundamentally different mechanisms, depending on whether a homologous template is available or not. Given that DNA is duplicated in S phase, homologous recombination is restricted to S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is also cell-cycle regulated, and the yeast CDK Cdc28 controls DNA resection, an early step of homologous recombination. In this work, Huertas et al. show that the target of Cdc28 in regulating DNA resection is Sae2, a protein with endonuclease activity that was first identified as being required for meiotic recombination. These results support models in which the commitment to DSB resection is highly regulated to ensure that the cell engages the most appropriate DNA repair pathway at the right time, thereby optimizing genome stability. DNA can be repaired by two different mechanisms, depending on whether a homologous template is available. Thus, homologous recombination is restricted to S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is also cell cycle regulated, and the yeast CDK Cdc28 controls DNA resection, an early step of homologous recombination. This work shows that the target of Cdc28 in regulating DNA resection is Sae2. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by two principal mechanisms: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)1. HR is the most accurate DSB repair mechanism but is generally restricted to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, when DNA has been replicated and a sister chromatid is available as a repair template2,3,4,5. By contrast, NHEJ operates throughout the cell cycle but assumes most importance in G1 (refs 4, 6). The choice between repair pathways is governed by cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs)2,3,5,7, with a major site of control being at the level of DSB resection, an event that is necessary for HR but not NHEJ, and which takes place most effectively in S and G2 (refs 2, 5). Here we establish that cell-cycle control of DSB resection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results from the phosphorylation by CDK of an evolutionarily conserved motif in the Sae2 protein. We show that mutating Ser 267 of Sae2 to a non-phosphorylatable residue causes phenotypes comparable to those of a sae2Δ null mutant, including hypersensitivity to camptothecin, defective sporulation, reduced hairpin-induced recombination, severely impaired DNA-end processing and faulty assembly and disassembly of HR factors. Furthermore, a Sae2 mutation that mimics constitutive Ser 267 phosphorylation complements these phenotypes and overcomes the necessity of CDK activity for DSB resection. The Sae2 mutations also cause cell-cycle-stage specific hypersensitivity to DNA damage and affect the balance between HR and NHEJ. These findings therefore provide a mechanistic basis for cell-cycle control of DSB repair and highlight the importance of regulating DSB resection."
https://openalex.org/W2098365070,"Intrinsic glomerular cells in a diabetic milieu have transcriptional activation of genes that influence the development of diabetic nephropathy. The cellular repertoire of microRNAs can regulate translation of these expressed genes into proteins. Fibronectin is a key matrix protein accumulated in excess in diabetic nephropathy. Here, we exposed cultured human and mouse mesangial cells to high glucose and transforming growth factor-beta to simulate the diabetic milieu. In these conditions in vitro, as well as in mouse diabetic nephropathy models in vivo, microRNA-377 was consistently up-regulated relative to controls. Through a combination of computational and biological approaches, we identified relevant miR-377 target genes. Although fibronectin was induced by miR-377, it was not a direct target of miR-377. However, miR-377 led to reduced expressions of p21-activated kinase and superoxide dismutase, which enhanced fibronectin protein production. Thus, overexpression of miR-377 in diabetic nephropathy indirectly leads to increased fibronectin protein production; as such, miR-377 can have a critical role in the pathophysiology of this prevalent human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2044221698,"Myogenic Akt signaling coordinates blood vessel recruitment with normal tissue growth. Here, we investigated the role of Follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1) in the regulation of endothelial cell function and blood vessel growth in muscle. Transgenic Akt1 overexpression in skeletal muscle led to myofiber growth that was coupled to an increase in muscle capillary density. Myogenic Akt signaling or ischemic hind limb surgery led to the induction of Fstl1 in muscle and increased circulating levels of Fstl1. Intramuscular administration of an adenoviral vector expressing Fstl1 (Ad-Fstl1) accelerated flow recovery and increased capillary density in the ischemic hind limbs of wild-type mice, and this was associated with an increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation at residue Ser-1179. In cultured endothelial cells, Ad-Fstl1 stimulated migration and differentiation into network structures and inhibited apoptosis under conditions of serum deprivation. These cell responses were associated with the activating phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. Conversely, transduction with dominant-negative Akt or LY294002 blocked Fstl1-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation and inhibited Fstl1-stimulated cellular responses. Treatment with the eNOS inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester also reduced endothelial cell migration and differentiation induced by Ad-Fstl1. The stimulatory effect of Ad-Fstl1 on ischemic limb reperfusion was abolished in mice lacking eNOS. These data indicate that Fstl1 is a secreted muscle protein or myokine that can function to promote endothelial cell function and stimulates revascularization in response to ischemic insult through its ability to activate Akt-eNOS signaling.

Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is associated with blood vessel recruitment, such that capillary density is either maintained or increased during muscle growth (1Degens H.

A number of studies have shown that the serine-threonine protein kinase Akt1 plays a key role in regulation of cellular hypertrophy and organ size (5Shiojima I. Walsh K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3347-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The expression of constitutively active Akt1 in skeletal muscle stimulates muscle hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo (6Takahashi A. Kureishi Y. Yang J. Luo Z. Guo K. Mukhopadhyay D. Ivashchenko Y.

Adenovirus-mediated transduction of constitutively active Akt1 also promotes the induction of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 3The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelium cell; Fstl1, Follistatin-like 1; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; eNOS-KO, eNOS-knockout; TG, transgenic; DTG, double transgenic; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; l-NAME, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; pfu, plaque-forming unit; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; dnAkt, dominant-negative Akt1; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; QRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; Ad-β-gal, adenoviral construct encoding or expressing β-galactosidase. and this is accompanied by an increase in limb perfusion and capillary density in muscles where Akt1 is overexpressed (6Takahashi A.

Constitutive activation of Akt1 in the heart also promotes myocardial angiogenesis, which is partly mediated by the induction of VEGF (10Shiojima I. Sato K. Izumiya Y. Schiekofer S. Ito M. Liao R. Colucci W. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2108-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 11Izumiya Y. Shiojima I. Sato K. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. Walsh K. Hypertension. 2006; 47: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that the Akt-VEGF signaling axis is a critical regulator of blood vessel recruitment during tissue growth. However, the process of angiogenesis is regulated by complex molecular mechanisms involving the participation of multiple factors (12Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to identify novel factors secreted from skeletal muscle that coordinate blood vessel recruitment with myofiber growth. Follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1), also referred to as TSC36, is an extracellular glycoprotein that, despite limited homology, has been grouped into the follistatin family of proteins (13Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Mita A. Kuroki T. Nose K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Fstl1 is poorly understood with regard to its functional significance. Transduction of cancer cell lines with Fstl1 has been shown to result in suppression of growth and invasiveness (14Sumitomo K. Kurisaki A. Yamakawa N. Tsuchida K. Shimizu E. Sone S. Sugino H. Cancer Lett. 2000; 155: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Johnston I.M. Spence H.J. Winnie J.N. McGarry L. Vass J.K. Meagher L. Stapleton G. Ozanne B.W. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that Fstl1 is up-regulated in myocardium in cardiac-specific Akt1 transgenic (TG) mice and that Fstl1 functions as a cardioprotective molecule with anti-apoptotic actions in cardiac myocytes (16Oshima Y. Ouchi N. Sato K. Izumiya Y. Pimentel D. Walsh K. Circulation. 2008; 117: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To date, however, the secretion of Fstl1 by skeletal muscle has not been investigated, and no functional analysis of Fstl1 has been performed in the setting of vascular disease. In the present study, we tested whether Fstl1 is secreted from skeletal muscle and whether it participates in blood vessel recruitment that is associated with muscle ischemia or myogenic Akt1 signaling. We also investigated whether Fstl1 affects cellular behavior and modulates intracellular signaling in cultured endothelial cells. Our observations indicate that Fstl1 is a secreted factor in myogenic cells that favors ischemia-induced revascularization through activation of Akt-eNOS-dependent signaling within endothelial cells. Materials—Phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-eNOS (Ser-1177), phospho-p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-GSK-3β (Ser-9), Akt, and ERK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. eNOS and GSK-3 antibodies was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, tubulin antibody was from Oncogene, and Fstl1 antibody was obtained from R&D Systems. Anti-human Fstl1 antibody was obtained from Abcam. LY294002 was obtained from Calbiochem, and NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) was obtained from Sigma. Muscle-specific Akt1 Transgenic Mice—The generation of skeletal muscle-specific inducible myrAkt1 TG mice was described previously (9Izumiya Y. Hopkins T. Morris C. Sato K. Zeng L. Viereck J. Hamilton J.A. Ouchi N. LeBrasseur N.K. Walsh K. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 159-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Briefly, tetracycline-responsive element constitutively active myrAkt1 (TRE-myrAkt1) TG mouse line was crossed with 1256 [3Emut] MCK-rtTA lines that express reverse tetracycline transactivator from 1256 [3Emut] MCK promoter to generate double-transgenic mice (DTG). To activate Akt1 transgene, DTGs were administered doxycycline (0.5 mg/ml) in their drinking water. Single 1256 [3Emut] MCK-reverse tetracycline transactivator TG littermates were used as controls and treated with doxycycline in the same way as DTG mice. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA from gastrocnemius muscles of DTG mice (2 weeks after Akt1 induction) and control reverse tetracycline transactivator TG littermates was analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 microarrays. Among transcripts that are up-regulated by Akt1 activation, we selected transcripts that have full-length open reading frame cDNAs available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. Amino acid sequences were examined for signal sequences by using Signal IP software. Amino acid sequences were also analyzed with SOSUI signal beta version software to predict proteins lacking transmembrane domain. Mouse Model of Revascularization—Male wild-type and eNOS-deficient (eNOS-KO) mice (Jackson Laboratory) in a C57/BL6 background were used for this study. Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in Boston University. Mice, at the ages of 10 weeks, were subjected to unilateral hind limb surgery under anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). In this model, the entire left femoral artery and vein were excised surgically (17Ouchi N. Shibata R. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 838-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Shibata R.

In some experiments, the 2 × 108 plaque-forming units (pfu) of adenoviral constructs encoding Fstl1 (Ad-Fstl1) or expressing β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal), as a control, were injected into five different sites of adductor muscle in the ischemic limb 3 days prior to the ischemic hind limb as previously described (17Ouchi N.

Hind limb blood flow was measured using a laser Doppler blood flow analyzer (Moor LDI, Moor Instruments) immediately before surgery and on postoperative days 3, 7, and 14. Hind limb blood flow was expressed as the ratio of left (ischemic) to right (non-ischemic) laser Doppler blood flow. In some experiments, Ad-Fstl1 or Ad-β-gal was injected into gastrocnemius muscle of wild-type mice (2 × 108 pfu each). Following sacrifice, capillary density within gastrocnemius or thigh adductor muscle was quantified by histological analysis (17Ouchi N. Shibata R. Walsh K. Circ.

Tissue slices (5 μm in thickness) were stained with anti-CD31 (PECAM-1, BD Biosciences) antibodies. Fifteen randomly chosen microscopic fields from three different sections in each tissue block were examined for the presence of CD31-positive capillary endothelial cells. Capillary density was expressed as the number of CD31-positive cells per muscle fiber or per high power field. Cell Culture, Adenoviral Infection, and Western Blot Analysis—Human umbilical vein endothelium cells (HUVECs) were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (Lonza) (19Ouchi N. Kobayashi H.

HUVECs were infected with adenoviral constructs encoding mouse Fstl1 (Ad-Fstl1) (16Oshima Y. Ouchi N. Sato K. Izumiya Y. Pimentel D. Walsh K.

In some experiments, HUVECs were treated with LY294002 (10 μm), l-NAME (1 mg/ml), or vehicle along with transduction with Ad-Fstl1 or Ad-β-gal. In some experiments, HUVECs were infected with adenoviral constructs encoding dominant-negative Akt1 (Ad-dnAkt) with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (19Ouchi N. Kobayashi H. Kihara S. Kumada M. Sato K.

C2C12 mouse myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum) and shifted to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated horse serum) for 4 days to induce differentiation (17Ouchi N. Shibata R. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 838-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). C2C12 myocytes were infected with Ad-Fstl1, or Ad-β-gal at an m.o.i. of 250 for 16 h followed by incubation with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Cell and tissue lysates or culture media were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution followed by the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a 1:5000 dilution. An ECL Western blotting Detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Relative phosphorylation or protein levels were quantified by using the ImageJ program. Immunoblots were normalized to total loaded protein. Determination of Fstl1 mRNA—Total RNA was prepared by Qiagen using the manufacturer's suggested protocol, and cDNA was produced using ThermoScript RT-PCR Systems (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed on an iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green I as a double-stranded DNA-specific dye as described previously (17Ouchi N. Shibata R. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 838-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Primers were: 5′-AACAGCCATCAACATCACCACTTAT-3′ and 5′-TTTCCAGTCAGCGTTCTCATCA-3′ for mouse Fstl1, 5′-TCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCA-3′ for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Migration Assay—Migratory activity was measured using a modified Boyden chamber assay (19Ouchi N. Kobayashi H. Kihara S. Kumada M. Sato K. Inoue T. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Serum-deprived cells were trypsinized and resuspended in endothelial cell basal medium-2 in the absence of serum. Cell suspensions (250 μl, 2.0 × 104 cells/well) were added to the Transwell insert (8.0-μm pore size, BD Biosciences). After 18 h, migrated cells on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed and stained with Giemsa stain solution, and eight random microscopic fields per well were quantified. Differentiation Assay—The formation of network structures by HUVECs on growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was performed as previously described (19Ouchi N. Kobayashi H. Kihara S. Kumada M. Sato K. Inoue T. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Twenty-four-well culture plates were coated with Matrigel according to the manufacturer's instructions. HUVECs were seeded on coated plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in serum-free endothelial cell basal medium-2 and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Network formation was observe using an inverted phase contrast microscope (Nikon). Images were captured with a video graphic system (DEI-750 CE digital output camera, Optronics). The degree of differentiation into vascular-like structures was quantified by measuring the network areas in three randomly chosen fields from each well using the ImageJ program. Analysis of Apoptotic Activity—Cells were transduced with adenoviral constructs for 8 h followed by incubation with serum-free endothelial cell basal medium-2 for 48 h. Nucleosome fragmentation was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Cell viability was also measured by MTS reagent using the CellTiter 96 AQueous kit (Promega) (21Kobayashi H. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Walsh K. Kumada M. Abe Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: e27-e31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TUNEL staining was performed using the In Situ Cell Death detection kit (Roche) (22Shibata R. Sato K. Pimentel D.R. Takemura Y. Kihara S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Ouchi N. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). TUNEL-positive cells were counted in five randomly selected microscopic fields. Each experiment was repeated four times. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.D. or S.E. as indicated in the figure legends. Differences were analyzed by Student's unpaired t test or analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. A level of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Akt1 Overexpression in Skeletal Muscle Increases Capillary Vessel Formation and Up-regulates Fstl1 Expression—Initially we examined the consequences of Akt1 transgene expression on blood vessel formation in skeletal muscle employing skeletal muscle-specific Akt1 TG mice (9Izumiya Y. Hopkins T. Morris C. Sato K. Zeng L. Viereck J. Hamilton J.A. Ouchi N. LeBrasseur N.K. Walsh K. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 159-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Mice were treated with doxycycline for 2 weeks to activate Akt1 transgene, resulting in an increase of ∼40% in gastrocnemius muscle mass weight (9Izumiya Y. Hopkins T. Morris C. Sato K. Zeng L. Viereck J. Hamilton J.A. Ouchi N. LeBrasseur N.K. Walsh K. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 159-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). At this time point, capillary density in gastrocnemius muscle was assessed by staining with an endothelial marker CD31. Fig. 1A shows representative photographs of tissues stained with CD31. Quantitative analysis revealed that the capillary density per high power field was significantly increased in mice following 2 weeks of Akt1 activation compared with control mice (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the number of CD31-positive cells per muscle fiber was significantly higher in Akt1-TG mice than in control mice (0.84 ± 0.07 in control mice and 2.45 ± 0.19 in Akt1-TG mice). Microarray analysis of expressed transcripts was performed, and transcripts up-regulated by myogenic Akt signaling were evaluated for the presence of a signal peptide and the absence of a transmembrane domain in their open reading frames using Signal IP and SOSUI software, respectively. The Fstl1 transcript was of interest, because it was up-regulated by a factor of 1.9 after Akt1 transgene activation by microarray analysis, and it is predicted to encode a secreted protein. We next confirmed the effect of transgenic Akt1 activation on Fstl1 expression in skeletal muscle. Fstl1 mRNA levels were up-regulated in gastrocnemius muscle by a factor of 5.3 following 2 weeks of Akt1 activation, as determined by QRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1B). Fstl1 protein levels were also increased in gastrocnemius muscle by Akt1 transgene induction as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Two immunoreactive bands of Fstl1 (37- and 46-kDa proteins) were detected in mouse skeletal muscle. Quantitative analysis of the 37-kDa band indicated the 4.1 ± 0.5-fold increase in Fstl1 protein. Fstl1 protein was also detected in mouse serum, and serum Fstl1 levels were markedly increased by a factor of 3.4 ± 0.4 at 2 weeks after Akt transgene activation in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1B). To examine whether Fstl1 is secreted from cultured muscle cells, differentiated C2C12 cells were treated with adenoviral vectors expressing Fstl1 (Ad-Fstl1) or β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal). Fstl1 protein was detected in both the cell pellet lysate and media of control cells treated with Ad-β-gal (Fig. 1C). Ad-Fstl1 treatment increased Fstl1 protein levels in both the cell lysate (2.7 ± 0.1-fold increase) and media (2.0 ± 0.3-fold increase) (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these data suggest that Fstl1 is up-regulated by Akt signaling and secreted from skeletal muscle. Muscle Ischemia Up-regulates Fstl1 Expression—To further characterize the regulation of Fstl1, expression was determined in ischemic adductor muscle following femoral artery excision. Fstl1 mRNA levels were 2.3-fold higher in ischemic muscles than in non-ischemic muscles at 7 days after ischemic surgery as measured by QRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2A). Fstl1 protein levels in ischemic muscles were also increased by a factor of 2.6 ± 0.3 as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, hind limb ischemia increased Fstl1 levels in serum by a factor of 2.1 ± 0.3 at 2 weeks following ischemic surgery (Fig. 2B). Fstl1 Promotes Revascularization in Response to Ischemia in Vivo—To test whether Fstl1 can modulate revascularization under conditions of ischemia in vivo, we employed C57BL/6 wild-type mice that underwent unilateral femoral artery resection. This model of vascular insufficiency has been used to evaluate the in vivo angiogenic actions of growth factors, including VEGF (23Couffinhal T. Silver M. Kearney M. Sullivan A. Witzenbichler B. Magner M. Annex B. Peters K. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3188-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24Rivard A. Silver M. Chen D. Kearney M. Magner M. Annex B. Peters K. Isner J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 355-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Adenoviral vectors expressing Fstl1 (Ad-Fstl1) or Ad-β-gal (control) were injected intramuscularly into the adductor muscle 3 days before surgery. Fstl1 protein levels in ischemic muscle were significantly elevated by a factor of 6.9 ± 0.5 at 6 days after injection of Ad-Fstl1 (Fig. 3A). Ad-Fstl1-treated mice showed a significant increase in flow recovery at 3, 7, and 14 days after ischemic surgery as determined by laser Doppler blood flow analysis (Fig. 3B). To investigate the extent of revascularization at the microcirculatory level, capillary density was measured in histological sections harvested from the ischemic muscles. Quantitative analysis revealed that the capillary density was significantly increased in Ad-Fstl1-treated mice compared with control mice on postoperative day 14 (Fig. 3C). To investigate whether Fstl1 can stimulate blood vessel growth in non-ischemic muscle, the gastrocnemius muscle of wild-type mice was injected with Ad-Fstl1 or Ad-β-gal. No significant differences in the capillary density of non-ischemic muscles were observed between Ad-Fstl1-treated and control mice (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these data indicate that Fstl1 will enhance revascularization in ischemic tissue, but it is not sufficient to activate an angiogenic response in normal tissue. Fstl1 Promotes Endothelial Cell Function and Survival in Vitro—To examine whether Fstl1 can directly act on endothelial cells, HUVECs were transduced with Ad-Fstl1 or Ad-β-gal and plated on a Matrigel matrix. Fstl1 protein expression was readily detected in both cell lysate (4.6 ± 0.3-fold increase) and media (3.5 ± 0.4-fold increase) from HUVECs treated with Ad-Fstl1, whereas endogenous levels of Fstl1 expression were low (Fig. 4A). Quantitative analyses of endothelial cell network area revealed that treatment with Ad-Fstl1 significantly promoted the formation of network structures relative to control cultures treated with Ad-β-gal (Fig. 4B). To test whether Ad-Fstl1 influences endothelial cell migration, a modified Boyden chamber assay was performed. Ad-Fstl1 treatment significantly stimulated HUVEC migration in this assay (Fig. 4B). To evaluate the role of Fstl1 in endothelial apoptosis, HUVECs were treated with Ad-Fstl1 or Ad-β-gal followed by 48 h of incubation in serum-free media. Fstl1 markedly suppressed the extent of nucleosome fragmentation as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 5A). Ad-Fstl1 also reduced HUVEC death caused by serum deprivation as assessed by an MTS-based assay (Fig. 5B). To corroborate these findings, TUNEL-positive cells were analyzed in the HUVEC cultures. As shown in the Fig. 5C, treatment with Ad-Fstl1 diminished the frequency of TUNEL-positive cells under serum-deprived conditions. Fstl1 Stimulates the Phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS—Akt has been shown to be a key mediator of growth factor-dependent angiogenic and survival signals in endothelial cells (20Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 25Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test whether Fstl1 influences Akt signaling in endothelial cells, the activating phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was assessed by Western blot analysis. Treatment of HUVECs with Ad-Fstl1 enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt by a factor of 4.2 ± 0.3 (Fig. 6A). Because Akt can phosphorylate eNOS at Ser-1179 (26Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 27Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.Z. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar), eNOS phosphorylation was also examined in these cultures. Ad-Fstl1 stimulation resulted in a 3.0 ± 0.3-fold increase in eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 (Fig. 6A). Consistent with an increase in Akt signaling, a 2.0 ± 0.1-fold increase in GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser-9, a downstream target of Akt signaling in endothelial cells (28Kim H.-S. Skurk C. Thomas S.R. Bialik A. Suhara T. Kureishi Y. Birnbaum M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41888-41896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), was seen under these conditions (Fig. 6A). In contrast, Ad-Fstl1 had no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK at Thr-202/Tyr-204 (1.3 ± 0.1-fold) (Fig. 6A). To examine the role of Akt in the regulation of eNOS phosphorylation by Fstl1, HUVECs were infected with a HA-tagged dominant-negative Akt (Ad-dnAkt) or Ad-β-gal. Transduction with Ad-dnAkt reduced Fstl1-induced Akt and eNOS phosphorylation (1.0 ± 0.2 in Ad-β-gal, 3.5 ± 0.3 in Ad-Fstl1, 0.9 ± 0.1 in Ad-β-gal+Ad-dnAkt, 1.2 ± 0.2 in Ad-Fstl1+Ad-dnAkt) (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that Akt mediates eNOS phosphorylation downstream from Fstl1. Role of eNOS Signaling in Fstl1-stimulated Revascularization—To test whether the activation of Akt signaling is required for Fstl1-stimulated differentiation, migration, and survival, HUVECs were infected with Ad-dnAkt or Ad-β-gal, and endothelial cell function and survival was assessed. Transduction with Ad-dnAkt blocked Ad-Fstl1-induced network formation by HUVECs plated on Matrigel (Fig. 6C). Ad-Fstl1-stimulated endothelial cell migration was also diminished by transduction with Ad-dnAkt, whereas Ad-dnAkt had no effect on basal migration (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, transduction with Ad-dnAkt reversed the inhibitory effects of Ad-Fstl1 on the degree of nucleosome fragmentation (Fig. 6E). These results indicate that Akt signaling is required for Fstl1-induced endothelial cell differentiation, migration, and survival. Akt is activated by many growth factors through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway (25Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PI3K participates in Fstl1-induced signaling, HUVECs were treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Treatment with LY294002 abolished Ad-Fstl1-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in HUVECs (Fig. 7A). Ad-Fstl1-stimulated network formation and migration of HUVECs were also blocked by treatment with LY294002 (Fig. 7, B and C). These data indicate that PI3K is essential for endothelial cell responses to Fstl1 and that PI3K functions upstream from the Akt-eNOS regulatory axis in Fstl1-stimulated cells. To test the role of eNOS in the cellular responses to Fstl1, HUVECs were treated with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME. l-NAME treatment significantly reduced Ad-Fstl1-induced endothelial cell differentiation into network structures and migration (Fig. 7, B and C), indicating that Fstl1 promotes endothelial cell function in an eNOS-dependent manner. To analyze the potential role of eNOS activation in Fstl1-mediated regulation of revascularization in vivo, the phosphorylation status of eNOS and Akt in ischemic muscles of C57/BL6 mice was assessed by Western blot analysis at day 6 after intramuscular injection of Ad-Fstl1 and Ad-β-gal. Ad-Fstl1 treatment stimulated eNOS phosphorylation at serine residue 1177 in ischemic adductor muscle by a factor of 3.3 ± 0.3 without affecting total eNOS protein levels (Fig. 8A). Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 in ischemic muscles was also stimulated 1.9 ± 0.1-fold by Ad-Fstl1 treatment (Fig. 8A). To assess the contribution of eNOS signaling to the stimulatory actions of Fstl1 on ischemia-driven revascularization in vivo, we intramuscularly injected Ad-Fstl1 or Ad-β-gal into eNOS-knock-out (eNOS-KO) mice 3 days before induction of ischemia. At 6 days after Ad-Fstl1 infection, Fstl1 protein levels in ischemic muscles of eNOS-KO mice increased by a factor of 7.3 ± 0.6 that was similar to a 7.1 ± 0.4-fold increase in wild-type C57/BL6 mice (Fig. 8A). Fstl1 protein levels did not differ between Ad-β-gal-treated wild-type and eNOS-KO mice (1.0 ± 0.1-fold versus 0.8 ± 0.1-fold). Akt phosphorylation in ischemic muscles of eNOS-KO mice was stimulated by Ad-Fstl1 treatment to a similar extent (1.8 ± 0.1-fold) compared with that of wild-type mice (1.9 ± 0.1-fold) (Fig. 8A). However, in contrast to wild-type mice (Fig. 3B), treatment with Ad-Fstl1 did not promote flow recovery in ischemic hind limbs in eNOS-KO mice (Fig. 8B). Thus the stimulatory action of Fstl1 on revascularization in vivo is dependent on eNOS. The present study shows for the first time that Fstl1 plays a role in promoting endothelial cell function and revascularization under conditions of ischemic stress. Fstl1 expression in muscle was up-regulated by Akt1 transgene activation during muscle hypertrophy and by ischemic injury. Fstl1 overexpression was shown to enhance endothelial cell differentiation and migration and diminish endothelial cell apoptosis. Administration of Fstl1 improved revascularization in ischemic limbs of wild-type mice. It is well documented that Akt-eNOS signaling participates in regulation of endothelial cell function and blood vessel growth under conditions of ischemic stress (20Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 25Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 29Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that the stimulation of revascularization of ischemic tissue by Fstl1 is dependent on its ability to activate Akt-eNOS signaling in endothelial cells. Fstl1 stimulated the activating phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, whereas transduction with dominant-negative Akt reduced Fstl1-stimulated endothelial cell differentiation, migration, survival, and eNOS phosphorylation. Inhibitors of PI3K or eNOS also blocked the increase in endothelial differentiation and migration caused by Fstl1. The consequences of Fstl1 overexpression on revascularization in ischemic muscle was associated with increased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177, and the vascular actions of Fstl1 were abolished in eNOS-KO mice. Collectively, these observations suggest that the Fstl1-Akt-eNOS regulatory signaling axis functions to stimulate vascular cell function under ischemic conditions, thereby promoting revascularization. It has been proposed that skeletal muscle secretes factors, referred to as “myokines,” that influence the behavior of neighboring or remote cells (30Pedersen B.K. Akerstrom T.C. Nielsen A.R. Fischer C.P. J. Appl. Physiol. 2007; 103: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that Fstl1 can be designated as a myokine that acts on vascular endothelial cells. Both Akt transgene-induced myofiber hypertrophy and ischemic hind limb surgery led to an increase in tissue-resident and serum levels of Fstl1. Furthermore, Fstl1 is secreted into the media by cultured skeletal muscle cells, and it can directly act on endothelial cell signaling pathways that promote function and survival. Tissue ischemia will lead to the up-regulation of multiple growth factors that function to coordinate the repair of the vascular network (12Carmeliet P. Nature. 2005; 438: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). It is also recognized that skeletal muscle hypertrophy is coupled to angiogenesis, through molecular mechanisms that are independent of tissue hypoxia (6Takahashi A. Kureishi Y. Yang J. Luo Z. Guo K. Mukhopadhyay D. Ivashchenko Y. Branellec D. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4803-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). VEGF, a strong stimulator of angiogenesis, is up-regulated during myofiber hypertrophy by myogenic Akt signaling. The overexpression of VEGF will stimulate angiogenesis in muscle under normoxic conditions leading to the development of a disorganized vascular complex (31Lee R.J. Springer M.L. Blanco-Bose W.E. Shaw R. Ursell P.C. Blau H.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 898-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In contrast to VEGF, Fstl1 overexpression accelerates revascularization in ischemic muscle, but does not stimulate vessel growth in normoxic muscle. Thus, it appears that Fstl1 does not function as an “angiogenic factor” per se, but it has salutary effects on the endothelium under conditions of stress and thereby promotes the revascularization process in response to chronic tissue ischemia. Thus, we hypothesize that the up-regulation and secretion of Fstl1 by skeletal muscle, under conditions of hypertrophic growth or ischemic stress, will contribute to revascularization through its ability to promote endothelial cell function. In agreement with the current study, we recently reported that Fstl1 is up-regulated during cardiac hypertrophy (16Oshima Y. Ouchi N. Sato K. Izumiya Y. Pimentel D. Walsh K. Circulation. 2008; 117: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this study, Fstl1 was shown to activate Akt signaling in cardiac myocytes and inhibit apoptosis. Thus, Fstl1 can function as a survival factor for both cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells via the activation of Akt signaling. Fstl1 overexpression has also been shown to protect the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Treatments aimed at increasing angiogenesis represent a promising strategy for treatment of ischemic limb and heart diseases (32Vale P.R. Isner J.M. Rosenfield K. J. Interv. Cardiol. 2001; 14: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, Fstl1 could be considered a potential therapeutic agent for ischemic diseases based upon its ability to directly stimulate blood vessel formation and inhibit the death of cardiovascular cells. Other members of the follistatin family function to regulate transforming growth factor-β superfamily proteins through their ability to function as binding partners (33Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activin A has been shown to suppress endothelial cell growth and attenuate angiogenesis by a chorioallantoic membrane assay (34Breit S. Ashman K. Wilting J. Rossler J. Hatzi E. Fotsis T. Schweigerer L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4596-4601PubMed Google Scholar), and follistatin is reported to promote angiogenesis through its ability to bind to activin (35Kozian D.H. Ziche M. Augustin H.G. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 267-276PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether Fstl1 binds to members of transforming growth factor-β superfamily in a manner that is similar to follistatin (36Mashimo J. Maniwa R. Sugino H. Nose K. Cancer Lett. 1997; 113: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this regard Fstl1 exhibits little amino acid sequence homology with follistatin (7%), and our in vitro data show that overexpression of Fstl1 results in enhanced Akt signaling in cultured endothelial cells under conditions of serum deprivation. Thus, it is unlikely that the actions of Fstl1 on endothelial cell signaling and phenotype are mediated by its ability to modulate the function of a second secreted protein. Attempts are currently in progress to identify the Fstl1 receptor in endothelial cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Fstl1 is a myokine that activates Akt-eNOS signaling in endothelial cells. Overexpression of Fstl1 stimulates ischemia-induced revascularization in mice through activation of eNOS. Because the dysregulated eNOS signaling is linked to endothelial dysfunction, impaired neovascularization, and atherogenesis (37Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 998-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 38Forstermann U. Munzel T. Circulation. 2006; 113: 1708-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar, 39Murohara T. Asahara T.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), strategies to increase Fstl1-eNOS signaling could be a useful treatment for vascular complications."

https://openalex.org/W2122674384,"Patterns of methylation at lysine 4 and 27 of histone H3 have been associated with states of gene activation and repression that are developmentally regulated and are thought to underlie the establishment of lineage specific gene expression programs. Recent studies have provided fundamental insight into the problem of lineage specification by comparing global changes in chromatin and transcription between ES and neural stem (NS) cells, points respectively of departure and arrival for neural commitment. With these maps of the differentiated state in place, a central task is now to unravel the chromatin dynamics that enables these differentiation transitions. In particular, the observation that lineage-specific genes repressed in ES cells by Polycomb-mediated H3-K27 trimethylation (H3-K27me3) are demethylated and derepressed in differentiated cells posited the existence of a specific H3-K27 demethylase. In order to gain insight into the epigenetic transitions that enable lineage specification, we investigated the early stages of neural commitment using as model system the monolayer differentiation of mouse ES cells into neural stem (NS) cells. Starting from a comprehensive profiling of JmjC-domain genes, we report here that Jmjd3, recently identified as a H3-K27me3 specific demethylase, controls the expression of key regulators and markers of neurogenesis and is required for commitment to the neural lineage. Our results demonstrate the relevance of an enzymatic activity that antagonizes Polycomb regulation and highlight different modalities through which the dynamics of H3-K27me3 is related to transcriptional output. By showing that the H3-K27 demethylase Jmjd3 is required for commitment to the neural lineage and that it resolves the bivalent domain at the Nestin promoter, our work confirms the functional relevance of bivalent domain resolution that had been posited on the basis of the genome-wide correlation between their controlled resolution and differentiation. In addition, our data indicate that the regulation of H3-K27me3 is highly gene- and context- specific, suggesting that the interplay of methyltransferases and demethylases enables the fine-tuning more than the on/off alternation of methylation states."

https://openalex.org/W2143636931,"Women are at great risk for mood and anxiety disorders during their childbearing years and may become pregnant while taking antidepressant drugs. In the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most frequently prescribed drugs, while it is largely unknown whether this medication affects the development of the central nervous system of the fetus. The possible effects are the product of placental transfer efficiency, time of administration and dose of the respective SSRI.In order to attain this information we have setup a study in which these parameters were measured and the consequences in terms of physiology and behavior are mapped. The placental transfer of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, two commonly used SSRIs, was similar between mouse and human, indicating that the fetal exposure of these SSRIs in mice is comparable with the human situation. Fluvoxamine displayed a relatively low placental transfer, while fluoxetine showed a relatively high placental transfer. Using clinical doses of fluoxetine the mortality of the offspring increased dramatically, whereas the mortality was unaffected after fluvoxamine exposure. The majority of the fluoxetine-exposed offspring died postnatally of severe heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. Molecular analysis of fluoxetine-exposed offspring showed long-term alterations in serotonin transporter levels in the raphe nucleus. Furthermore, prenatal fluoxetine exposure resulted in depressive- and anxiety-related behavior in adult mice. In contrast, fluvoxamine-exposed mice did not show alterations in behavior and serotonin transporter levels. Decreasing the dose of fluoxetine resulted in higher survival rates and less dramatic effects on the long-term behavior in the offspring.These results indicate that prenatal fluoxetine exposure affects fetal development, resulting in cardiomyopathy and a higher vulnerability to affective disorders in a dose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2046999134,"While human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection continue to increase globally, available clinical data on H5N1 cases are limited. We conducted a retrospective study of 26 confirmed human H5N1 cases identified through surveillance in China from October 2005 through April 2008.Data were collected from hospital medical records of H5N1 cases and analyzed. The median age was 29 years (range 6-62) and 58% were female. Many H5N1 cases reported fever (92%) and cough (58%) at illness onset, and had lower respiratory findings of tachypnea and dyspnea at admission. All cases progressed rapidly to bilateral pneumonia. Clinical complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 81%), cardiac failure (50%), elevated aminotransaminases (43%), and renal dysfunction (17%). Fatal cases had a lower median nadir platelet count (64.5 x 10(9) cells/L vs 93.0 x 10(9) cells/L, p = 0.02), higher median peak lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (1982.5 U/L vs 1230.0 U/L, p = 0.001), higher percentage of ARDS (94% [n = 16] vs 56% [n = 5], p = 0.034) and more frequent cardiac failure (71% [n = 12] vs 11% [n = 1], p = 0.011) than nonfatal cases. A higher proportion of patients who received antiviral drugs survived compared to untreated (67% [8/12] vs 7% [1/14], p = 0.003).The clinical course of Chinese H5N1 cases is characterized by fever and cough initially, with rapid progression to lower respiratory disease. Decreased platelet count, elevated LDH level, ARDS and cardiac failure were associated with fatal outcomes. Clinical management of H5N1 cases should be standardized in China to include early antiviral treatment for suspected H5N1 cases."
https://openalex.org/W2085100616,"Mutations in p97/VCP cause the multisystem disease inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). p97/VCP is a member of the AAA+ (ATPase associated with a variety of activities) protein family and has been implicated in multiple cellular processes. One pathologic feature in IBMPFD is ubiquitinated inclusions, suggesting that mutations in p97/VCP may affect protein degradation. The present study shows that IBMPFD mutant expression increases ubiquitinated proteins and susceptibility to proteasome inhibition. Co-expression of an aggregate prone protein such as expanded polyglutamine in IBMPFD mutant cells results in an increase in aggregated protein that localizes to small inclusions instead of a single perinuclear aggresome. These small inclusions fail to co-localize with autophagic machinery. IBMPFD mutants avidly bind to these small inclusions and may not allow them to traffic to an aggresome. This is rescued by HDAC6, a p97/VCP-binding protein that facilitates the autophagic degradation of protein aggregates. Expression of HDAC6 improves aggresome formation and protects IBMPFD mutant cells from polyglutamine-induced cell death.

Ubiquitinated inclusions (UBIs) 2The abbreviations used are: UBI, ubiquitinated inclusion; UPS, ubiquitin proteasome system; IBMPFD, inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; LSD, least significant difference; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TA, tibialis anterior; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; MTS, tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] inner salt; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. 2The abbreviations used are: UBI, ubiquitinated inclusion; UPS, ubiquitin proteasome system; IBMPFD, inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; LSD, least significant difference; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TA, tibialis anterior; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; MTS, tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] inner salt; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. are a common pathology in many degenerative disorders associated with brain and muscle (1Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In many cases the molecular constituents of the UBIs are known and are a result of the misfolding of an aggregate prone or mutant protein such as α-synuclein in autosomal dominant Parkinson disease or expanded polyglutamine containing proteins in Huntington disease. UBIs in other degenerative disorders may be due to a global impairment in protein degradation. For example, after a misfolded substrate overwhelms the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) or as a result of mutations in proteins involved in specific protein degradation pathways. One example is the autosomal dominantly inherited disorder inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) associated with mutations in the UPS chaperone p97/VCP (2Watts G.D. Wymer J. Kovach M.J. Mehta S.G. Mumm S. Darvish D. Pestronk A. Whyte M.P. Kimonis V.E. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Affected tissue in IBMPFD contains prominent cytoplasmic and intranuclear UBIs (3Forman M.S. Mackenzie I.R. Cairns N.J. Swanson E. Boyer P.J. Drachman D.A. Jhaveri B.S. Karlawish J.H. Pestronk A.

In some cases these UBIs contain tubulofilamentous inclusions and insoluble protein aggregates (4Hubbers C.U. Clemen C.S. Kesper K. Boddrich A. Hofmann A. Kamarainen O. Tolksdorf K. Stumpf M. Reichelt J. Roth U. Krause S. Watts G. Kimonis V. Wattjes M.P. Reimann J. Thal D.R. Biermann K. Evert B.O. Lochmuller H. Wanker E.E. Schoser B.G. Noegel A.A. Schroder R. Brain. 2006; 130: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). p97/VCP belongs the AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of activities) protein family and participates in the degradation of proteins via the UPS (6Halawani D. Latterich M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 713-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). p97/VCP has a clear role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins (6Halawani D. Latterich M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 713-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In association with co-factors derlin-1, Ufd1, and Npl4, p97/VCP participates in the retrotranslocation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum lumen and transmembrane proteins facilitating their delivery to the UPS. We have previously shown that IBMPFD mutant p97/VCP fails to degrade the misfolded ERAD substrate ΔF508-CFTR as efficiently as wild type p97/VCP in cultured myoblasts (7Weihl C.C. Dalal S. Pestronk A. Hanson P.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). p97/VCP may also facilitate the degradation of soluble cytosolic proteins. Recently, IBMPFD mutations were found to impair the degradation of the cytosolic protein, Unc-45 (8Janiesch P.C. Kim J. Mouysset J. Barikbin R. Lochmuller H. Cassata G. Krause S. Hoppe T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Whether IBMPFD mutations in p97/VCP affect the degradation of all UPS substrates resulting in UBIs is unknown.UBIs can also form in the setting of impaired macroautophagy, herein referred to as autophagy (9Rubinsztein D.C. Nature. 2006; 443: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a nonselective mechanism for degrading long-lived proteins and organelles, whereas the UPS is a regulated means of targeting short-lived proteins to the proteasome. Genetic inactivation of autophagy in mouse central nervous system tissue results in prominent UBIs and neurodegeneration (10Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N. Nature. 2006; 441: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (3060) Google Scholar). Autophagy and the UPS have traditionally been thought to serve complementary yet parallel functions in protein homeostasis, and the inter-relationship between these two degradation systems is unclear (11Ding W.X. Ni H.M. Gao W. Yoshimori T. Stolz D.B. Ron D. Yin X.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). One potential point of intersection between autophagy and the UPS is the “aggresome” or inclusion body (12Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). An aggresome is a microtubule-dependent pericentriolar region of the cell that contains sequestered misfolded or aggregated proteins (13Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Aggresome formation occurs in the setting of UPS dysfunction because of decreased proteasome activity or the overwhelming accumulation of misfolded proteins (13Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). The aggresome also contains proteins such as LC3 and p62 along with lysosomes, suggesting that these are areas of active autophagic degradation (14Bjorkoy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar, 15Iwata A. Riley B.E. Johnston J.A. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40282-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins are trafficked to the aggresome via interactions with HDAC6 and dynein (13Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 15Iwata A. Riley B.E. Johnston J.A. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery involved in triaging degradation destined proteins to the UPS or autophagic pathways remains to be elucidated. This putative “segregase” would need to interact with ubiquitinated substrates as well as with both UPS and autophagic machinery.The current study examines the role of p97/VCP and its mutants in inclusion body formation and protein aggregate clearance. Although it is clear that p97/VCP plays a critical role in the ERAD degradation of misfolded proteins (6Halawani D. Latterich M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 713-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the role of p97/VCP in the degradation of cytosolically derived misfolded and aggregated proteins is less clear. Loss of p97/VCP function in mammalian cells leads to the accumulation of insoluble ubiquitinated proteins (17Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Wojcik C. Rowicka M. Kudlicki A. Nowis D. McConnell E. Kujawa M. Demartino G.N. Mol. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), similarly IBMPFD mutant p97/VCP expression in myoblasts and transgenic mouse muscle leads to the accumulation of UBIs (7Weihl C.C. Dalal S. Pestronk A. Hanson P.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Weihl C.C. Miller S.E. Hanson P.I. Pestronk A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). p97/VCP may be involved in inclusion body formation. Loss of p97/VCP or expression of a dominant negative ATP hydrolysis-deficient mutant impairs aggresome formation (19Wojcik C. Yano M. DeMartino G.N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Kitami M.I. Kitami T. Nagahama M. Tagaya M. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Mizuno Y. Hattori N.

Wang J.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2008; 228: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). p97/VCP associates with the aggresome essential protein, HDAC6 (23Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Muller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HDAC6 facilitates the degradation of expanded polyglutamine containing androgen receptor or ubiquitinated proteins in an autophagy-specific manner (25Pandey U.B. Nie Z. Batlevi Y. McCray B.A. Ritson G.P. Nedelsky N.B. Schwartz S.L. DiProspero N.A. Knight M.A. Schuldiner O. Padmanabhan R. Hild M. Berry D.L. Garza D. Hubbert C.C. Yao T.P. Baehrecke E.H. Taylor J.P. Nature. 2007; 447: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). We propose that p97/VCP associates with aggregated proteins and triages them to an inclusion body via interactions with HDAC6. IBMPFD mutants fail to release aggregated proteins, resulting in failed inclusion body formation and protein aggregate clearance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs and Cell Culture—The following plasmids are previously described: pcDNA4.0/TO p97/VCP-His/Myc and pcDNA3.1p97/VCP-Myc/His (17Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). IBMPFD mutations were introduced into these vectors using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and sequenced for the integrity of the p97/VCP sequence and verification of their respective point mutations. For lentiviral constructs, a BamHI-AgeI-digested fragment from pcDNA3.1Myc/His vector with the murine p97/VCP-fused to a Myc tag (containing wild type and E578Q, R95G, R155H, and A232E point mutations) was cloned into the BamHI-AgeI site of CCIV FM1 (lentiviral shuttle vector with a cytomegalovirus promoter) to generate the lentiviral constructs p97/VCP-Myc-IRES-VenusGFP. Lentiviruses are prepared as previously described (26Lee C.S. Tee L.Y. Warmke T. Vinjamoori A. Cai A. Fagan A.M. Snider B.J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Lentiviral particles released into tissue culture serum are titered by counting the number of GFP fluorescing cells following transduction into HEK293 cells. polyQ80-CFP was created from the parent vector polyQ80-GFP obtained from Dr. Gene Johnson (Washington University). Expression constructs containing p97/VCP-DsRed-WT, E305Q/E578Q, R155H, R95G, and A232E were a gift from Dr. Nigel Cairns (Washington University), pCMV-GFP-LC3 was gift from Dr. Robert Baloh (Washington University), and mcherry-ATG5 and HDAC6-FLAG constructs were obtained via Addgene. pcDNA4.0/TO-polyQ80-CFP was generated by digesting the polyQ80-CFP containing plasmid with BamHI-NotI and ligating to the BglII-NotI sites in pcDNA4.0/TO.U2OS TRex cells stably transfected with a tetracycline repressor plasmid (Invitrogen) were transfected with pcDNA4.0/TO vectors to generate cell lines expressing p97/VCP. Medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen) and 125 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) was added to select the stable cell lines. Approximately 12 days later, colonies of zeocin-resistant cells appeared. On average 25-30 colonies for each desired cell line were transferred into separate wells and screened. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were used to identify lines that expressed protein only in the presence of tetracycline. The cells were maintained with 50 μg/ml hygromycin B and 65 μg/ml zeocin, with the exception of nonstably transfected U20S cells, which were maintained with hygromycin B. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracyline for the indicated times. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and seeded in appropriate plates and grown to ∼80% confluence on the day of transfection. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For stable cell lines, tetracycline was added 16 h prior to plasmid transfection.Confocal and Electron Microscopy—U20S cells were plated on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with plasmid DNA or induced with tetracycline as above. 24-48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed, and then blocked with 3% goat serum for 1 h. After primary antibody incubation, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, washed several times, and mounted in antifade solution. The samples were observed using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).For thin section electron microscopy, transiently transfected cells were grown to 70% confluence in a 100-mm dish for 36 h. For sample preparation, trypsinized cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate, embedded, sectioned, and stained with uranyl acetate according to standard procedures.Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—The cells were plated and transfected 36 h prior to imaging on glass-bottomed dishes. Immediately before imaging, the medium was replaced with medium containing 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5. Imaging and photobleaching were performed using a Plan NEOFLUAR 63×/1.30 oil objective on an inverted confocal microscope (model LSM510 Meta; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). The cells transfected with CFP fusion proteins were imaged with 488-nm light and DsRed with 516-nm light, using 2% laser power and a pin hole of 1 airy unit. After two imaging scans, a selected area of the inclusion (region of interest) was bleached using maximal laser power for 10 iterations, and then the photobleached cell was imaged at 20-s intervals for 10 min. The collected images were analyzed using Zeiss LSM 5 software to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity in the region of interest as a function of time after photobleaching. The relative fluorescence intensity values are corrected by percentage of prebleaching values.Quantification of Inclusions—Normal U2OS cells and U2OS cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible p97/VCP-WT or IBMPFD mutants were induced with tetracycline and transfected with polyQ80-CFP for 48 h and then processed for fluorescence microscopic analysis of inclusion formation. The cells were counted. For inclusions, 10 random fields of each sample were selected, and the cells containing inclusions were manually counted for the number of inclusions/cell. ∼100 cells/experiment were counted and averaged among three replicates totaling ∼300 cells/condition. Counted cells were grouped into two categories: ≤3 inclusions/cell or >3 inclusions/cell, and the data were subjected to statistical analysis. Inclusion clearance was performed in a similar manner, except that total transfected cells were counted and the percentage of inclusion containing cells/total transfected cells were plotted for each time point and condition.Filter Trap Assay—Normal U2OS cells and U2OS cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible p97/VCP-WT or IBMPFD mutants were induced and transfected with polyQ80-CFP for 48 h. The cells were harvested using 1× PBS including protease inhibitors and brief sonication. Twenty μg of protein were mixed with 900 μl of PBS + 1% SDS. Subsequently, the samples were applied to a slot blot unit (Bio-Rad, Bio-Dot) and filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-GFP antibody.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation was performed using Seize Classic(G) immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). The cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed on ice for 30 min with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. The cell lysate were briefly sonicated, centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. One hundred microliters of cell lysate was incubated with 2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with rotation, immune complex, and 400 μl of protein G (50% slurry) beads were placed into a spin cup column and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (7Weihl C.C. Dalal S. Pestronk A. Hanson P.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-p97 (BD Biosciences), anti-LC3 (NanoTools), anti-p62 (Abgent), anti-HDAC6, anti-Myc, and anti-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-actin (sigma), anti-FK2 (Biomol), and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (B5).Electroporation into Mouse Tibialis Anterior (TA)—3-month-old female mice were anesthesized with pentobarbital, and their hindlimb was shaved. 20 μg of polyQ80-CFP expression construct resuspended in 50 μl of 1× PBS was injected into the TA with a 27-gauge needle. A 5-mm gap BTX 2 needle array attached to a BTX ECM 830 electroporator was set for 100 V, pulse length of 50 ms, pulse interval of 200 ms, and six pulses. The animals were allowed to recover, and TA muscle was harvested 7 days later.MTT/MTS Assays—U2OS stable cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight, and then the cells were induced. Transfection with 1.5 μg of polyQ80-CFP or polyQ19-CFP DNA was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twelve hours post-transfection, the cells were harvested and replated into 96-well plates. A CellTiter 96™ AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) kit containing the tetrazolium compound MTS was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to measure the number of cells. MTS color change was monitored by using an ELX-800 universal plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT) set at an absorbance reading of 490 nm. For proteasome sensitivity assays, the cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with vehicle or 10-fold dilutions of 1 mm MG132 or lactacystin. MTS assays were performed 16 h later, and the ratio of cells was determined via comparison with vehicle-treated controls for each.Statistical Analysis—The data were evaluated by analysis of variance followed by Fishers LSD post hoc comparisons at p < 0.05.RESULTSIBMPFD Mutant p97/VCP Impairs Inclusion Body Formation—We generated U20S cell lines that stably express tetracycline-inducible p97/VCP-WT, non-disease-associated ATPase inactive p97/VCP-E578Q or one of four different IBMPFD mutants (R155H (RH), R95G (RG), A232E (AE), and L198W (LW)) with a C-terminal Myc tag (Fig. 1A). Consistent with our previous studies (7Weihl C.C. Dalal S. Pestronk A. Hanson P.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), IBMPFD mutant p97/VCP and ATPase inactive p97/VCP-E578Q expression resulted in an increase in high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins as seen via immunoblot or immunofluorescence 16 h after tetracycline induction (Fig. 1, B and C). When these cells were stressed with sublethal doses of the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin, IBMPFD-expressing cells had fewer cells following treatment consistent with enhanced cell death as measured via MTT/MTS assay (Fig. 1D). Immunohistochemistry of MG132-treated cells with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (FK2) showed that only control U20S and p97/VCP-WT-expressing cells generated small perinuclear ubiquitin-positive inclusions consistent with an aggresome (Fig. 1C). In contrast, IBMPFD mutant-expressing cells had a perinuclear increase in ubiquitinated proteins but no clear aggresome (Fig. 1C). p97/VCP-E578Q-expressing cells had an increase in punctate endoplasmic reticulum-associated ubiquitinated inclusions as previously reported (17Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that IBMPFD mutant cells have impaired ubiquitinated protein aggregate handling to inclusion bodies, resulting in increased sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. Alternatively, the absence of ubiquitin-positive perinuclear inclusions may more generally reflect an overwhelming of the UPS system in IBMPFD mutant-expressing cells.To see whether IBMPFD mutants mishandled aggregated proteins without exogenous proteasome inhibitors, we co-expressed an expanded polyglutamine containing fusion protein (polyQ80-CFP) in U20S cells. PolyQ80-CFP intrinsically aggregates and forms inclusion bodies consistent with an aggresome. Aggresomes are a cellular response to increased levels of misfolded or aggregated proteins (13Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). They are localized to the microtubule organizing center and are surrounded by an intermediate filament network (13Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Although aggresomes contain aggregated protein, they are distinct from other protein aggregates because they are formed via an active sequestration of misfolded and aggregated proteins that requires an intact microtubule network. Therefore a protein or protein aggregate that fails to be rapidly degraded via the UPS will coalesce into these larger inclusion bodies or aggresomes (13Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Once in the aggresome, undegraded ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins are thought to be degraded via autophagy (27Taylor J.P. Tanaka F. Robitschek J. Sandoval C.M. Taye A. Markovic-Plese S. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).Following co-expression of polyQ80-CFP in cells expressing p97/VCP-WT fused to a DSred fluorescent tag, we saw p97/VCP-WT surrounding the inclusion body. Inclusion bodies in p97/VCP-WT-expressing cells were predominantly single or <3 inclusions/transfected cell (Fig. 2A) and had properties consistent with an aggresome (not shown). In contrast, there was a decrease in single perinuclear polyQ80-CFP inclusion bodies (≤3 inclusions/cell) in IBMPFD mutant-expressing cells. Instead there was an increase in smaller cytosolic inclusions (>3 inclusions/cell) that did not always co-localize with the microtubule organizing center. p97/VCP-R155H, R95G, and A232E proteins co-localized with polyQ80-CFP, although there were both polyQ80-CFP and p97/VCP-IBMPFD inclusions that did not co-localize (Fig. 2A, see arrows). An aggresome is traditionally defined as a single perinuclear inclusion body (13Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar); however, for purposes of quantitation, we counted the number of cells with ≤3 inclusions (aggresomal) or >3 inclusions (non-aggresomal). These data are graphically represented in Fig. 2B and by a low magnification field of p97/VCP-WT or IBMPFD mutant-expressing cells 48 h after transfection with polyQ80-CFP (Fig. 2C). Impaired inclusion body or aggresome formation was seen following expression of other proteins known to accumulate in aggresomes such as ΔF508-CFTR (7Weihl C.C. Dalal S. Pestronk A. Hanson P.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and CD3δ-YFP (Fig. 2D). PolyQ80 inclusions in both p97/VCP-WT and IBMPFD mutant p97/VCP co-localized with ubiquitin (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that IBMPFD mutants mishandle ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins by failing to send them to a single inclusion body.FIGURE 2Aggresome formation is impaired in IBMPFD mutant-expressing cells and tissue. A, representative live cell images of cells co-expressing polyQ80-CFP (blue) with DsRed tagged p97/VCP-WT (WT) or IBMPFD mutants R155H (RH), A232E (AE), and R95G (RG). Note that although p97/VCP co-localizes with polyQ80-CFP, there is impaired inclusion formation in IBMPFD mutant-expressing cells. B, control U20S or U20S cells stably expressing tetracycline-inducible p97/VCP-WT, ATPase inactive p97/VCP-E578Q (EQ) or IBMPFD mutant p97/VCP R155H, A232E, and L198W (LW) were transfected with polyQ80-CFP for 48 h. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldyhyde and processed for fluorescence microscopic analysis of inclusion bodies.

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), a sequela of infection with pathogenic streptococci, is a common cause of preventable kidney disease worldwide. Although PSGN usually occurs after infection with group A streptococci, organisms of Lancefield group C and G also can be responsible. Despite decades of study, the molecular pathogenesis of PSGN is poorly understood. As a first step toward gaining new information about PSGN pathogenesis, we sequenced the genome of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus strain MGCS10565, a group C organism that caused a very large and unusually severe epidemic of nephritis in Brazil. The genome is a circular chromosome of 2,024,171 bp. The genome shares extensive gene content, including many virulence factors, with genetically related group A streptococci, but unexpectedly lacks prophages. The genome contains many apparently foreign genes interspersed around the chromosome, consistent with the presence of a full array of genes required for natural competence. An inordinately large family of genes encodes secreted extracellular collagen-like proteins with multiple integrin-binding motifs. The absence of a gene related to speB rules out the long-held belief that streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B or antibodies reacting with it singularly cause PSGN. Many proteins previously implicated in GAS PSGN, such as streptokinase, are either highly divergent in strain MGCS10565 or are not more closely related between these species than to orthologs present in other streptococci that do not commonly cause PSGN. Our analysis provides a comparative genomics framework for renewed appraisal of molecular events underlying APSGN pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966685218,"Pulmonary gas exchange relies on a rich capillary network, which, together with alveolar epithelial type I and II cells, form alveolar septa, the functional units in the lung. Alveolar capillary endothelial cells are critical in maintaining alveolar structure, because disruption of endothelial cell integrity underlies several lung diseases. Here we show that targeted ablation of lung capillary endothelial cells recapitulates the cellular events involved in cigarette smoke-induced emphysema, one of the most prevalent nonneoplastic lung diseases. Based on phage library screening on an immortalized lung endothelial cell line, we identified a lung endothelial cell-binding peptide, which preferentially homes to lung blood vessels. This peptide fused to a proapoptotic motif specifically induced programmed cell death of lung endothelial cells in vitro as well as targeted apoptosis of the lung microcirculation in vivo. As early as 4 days following peptide administration, mice developed air space enlargement associated with enhanced oxidative stress, influx of macrophages, and up-regulation of ceramide. Given that these are all critical elements of the corresponding human emphysema caused by cigarette smoke, these data provide evidence for a central role for the alveolar endothelial cells in the maintenance of lung structure and of endothelial cell apoptosis in the pathogenesis of emphysema-like changes. Thus, our data enable the generation of a convenient mouse model of human emphysema.

Finally, combinatorial screenings on immortalized cells followed by in vivo targeting establishes an experimental framework for discovery and validation of additional ligand-directed pharmacodelivery systems. The alveolar septum is the critical lung functional unit involved in gas exchange. This unit is composed by a virtual cellular syncytium comprised by types I and II epithelial cells (1Sirianni F.E. Chu F.S. Walker D.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 1532-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which form the interface between air and blood flowing within an extensive capillary network (roughly the size of a tennis court) lined by endothelial cells. Disruption of alveolar integrity occurs in aging and in several lung diseases, particularly in emphysema, a highly prevalent pulmonary disease. Pulmonary emphysema is a chronic and incurable disease in which the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchiole are abnormally and permanently enlarged due to the destruction of their walls (2Snider G.L. Kleinerman J.L. Thurlbeck W.M. Bengali Z.H. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 182-185PubMed Google Scholar), leading to airflow limitation and impaired blood oxygenation. Historically, emphysema has been linked to an excessive lung inflammation caused by the chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke and the ensuing protease/anti-protease imbalance (3Shapiro S.D. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 346-352PubMed Google Scholar). A “vascular hypothesis” for emphysema originated ∼40 years ago based on the observation of scarcity of pulmonary capillaries in remaining alveolar septa in emphysematous human lungs (4Liebow A.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1959; 80: 67-93PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the reports of emphysema caused by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 5The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; LB, Luria broth; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling; 8-oxo-dG, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine; SpC, surfactant protein C; TU, transducing units. 5The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; LB, Luria broth; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling; 8-oxo-dG, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine; SpC, surfactant protein C; TU, transducing units. receptor blockade and Cre-recombinase-mediated lung VEGF deletion uncovered the novel role of alveolar cell apoptosis, including endothelial cells, in the pathogenesis of the disease (5Kasahara Y.

This unique role of VEGF in lung homeostasis relies on the trophic effect of VEGF on alveolar endothelial cells (5Kasahara Y. Tuder R.M. Taraseviciene-Stewart L. Le Cras T.D. Abman S. Hirth P.K. Waltenberger J. Voelkel N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) and its differentiation-promoting role on type II alveolar cells (9Compernolle V.

Med. 2002; 8: 702-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that disruption of VEGF receptor signaling alters the cellular and molecular maintenance program in the lung and sets up a destructive cycle involving the mutual interaction of oxidative stress and apoptosis of alveolar cells (6Tuder R.M. Zhen L. Cho C.Y. Taraseviciene-Stewart L. Kasahara Y. Salvemini D. Voelkel N.F. Flores S.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Hubbard W.C. Berdyshev E.V. Tuder R.M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). These observations were further confirmed with the report of emphysema in mice in which the VEGF gene has been deleted by lung expression of CRE recombinase (8Tang K. Rossiter H.B. Wagner P.D. Breen E.C. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97 (Discussion, 1549): 1559-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and our finding of emphysema in mice treated with the combination of VEGF-R1 and -R2 blocked with neutralizing MF1 and DC101 antibodies, respectively (11Petrache I.

Furthermore, clinical studies supported several elements of this novel paradigm, notably that, in comparison with normal lungs, human emphysema lungs have decreased expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors, enhanced alveolar cell apoptosis, and increased levels of proapoptotic lipid ceramide (10Petrache I.

Despite the growing recognition of alveolar cell apoptosis in the pathogenesis of emphysema, the specific contributions of individual alveolar cells (endothelial, epithelial, or myofibroblastic cells) in triggering disruption of alveolar integrity and ultimately governing the process of alveolar cell destruction in emphysema remains unknown. We previously noted that endothelial cell apoptosis predominated in the accelerated emphysema caused by cigarette smoke exposure of mice deficient in the master antioxidant transcription factor NRF-2 (17Rangasamy T. Cho C.Y. Thimmulappa R.K. Zhen L. Srisuma S.S. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Petrache I. Tuder R.M. Biswal S. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). However, other reports emphasized the potential role of epithelial cell apoptosis in cigarette smoke-induced emphysema (18Zheng T. Kang M.J. Crothers K. Zhu Z. Liu W. Lee C.G. Rabach L.A. Chapman H.A. Homer R.J. Aldous D. DeSanctis G. Underwood S. Graupe M. Flavell R.A. Schmidt J.A. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 8106-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Experimental approaches aimed at identifying the structural and functional roles of the different types of alveolar cells in alveolar maintenance are crucial for understanding the mechanisms involved in lung homeostasis and for designing studies aimed at therapeutic interventions for a wide range of lung diseases. Emphysema is characterized by a progressive decrease in alveolar gas exchange, possibly as the result of a loss of alveolar capillaries. The potential link between alveolar cell apoptosis and disruption of molecular and cellular signaling involved in alveolar structural maintenance and repair has broader implications in that cigarette smoke-induced alveolar injury may share pathogenetic features in common with alveolar enlargement due to aging (19Tuder R.M. Yoshida T. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Petrache I. Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2006; 3: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). There is growing evidence that endothelial cells have unique biochemical fingerprints that account for tissue- and/or blood vessel-specific biochemical heterogeneity of the vascular endothelium (20Sato M. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Oncology. 2007; 21: 1346-1352PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1996; 380: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Recent proteomic approaches have provided substantial evidence that such premises apply to lung endothelial cells (22Oh Y. Mohiuddin I. Sun Y. Putnam Jr., J.B. Hong W.K. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Chest. 2005; 128: 596S-600SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The introduction of combinatorial approaches has enabled unbiased probing of cell surfaces for differentially expressed membrane-associated receptors and their homing ligands in functional screenings (21Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1996; 380: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 23Arap W. Kolonin M.G. Trepel M. Lahdenranta J. Cardó-Vila M. Giordano R.J. Mintz P.J. Ardelt P.U. Yao V.J.

Given the phenotypic attributes of lung vasculature, we hypothesized that the expression of unique lung endothelial cell-specific peptide ligands will serve as molecular tools to interrogate the role of lung capillary endothelial cells in maintaining in vivo alveolar integrity. Here we used ImmortoMouse-derived lung endothelial cells to screen a phage display random peptide library, since these immortalized cells retain several important molecular features corresponding to the tissue of origin (26Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 27Langley R.R. Ramirez K.M. Tsan R.Z. Van Arsdall M. Nilsson M.B. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2971-2976PubMed Google Scholar). These endothelial cells are part of a panel of tissue-specific microvascular endothelial cell lines from the H-2Kb-tsA58 mouse (termed ImmortoMouse) (27Langley R.R. Ramirez K.M. Tsan R.Z. Van Arsdall M. Nilsson M.B. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2971-2976PubMed Google Scholar); such endothelial cells harbor a temperature sensitive SV40 large T antigen under the major histocompatibility complex H-2Kb promoter and are conditionally immortal when cultured under permissive temperatures (26Jat P.S. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Tanaka Y. Yannoutsos N. Larsen L. Kioussis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 27Langley R.R. Ramirez K.M. Tsan R.Z. Van Arsdall M. Nilsson M.B. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2971-2976PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we postulated that lung endothelial cells have unique cell surface molecular characteristics, distinct from other vascular beds, that allows for selection of specific peptides using a phage display library. Furthermore, this unique peptide would permit organ-specific in vivo targeting with a proapoptotic agent to address whether selective alveolar capillary endothelial cell apoptosis triggers the seminal features seen in cigarette smoke-induced emphysema. The combination of in vitro screening and in vivo validation presented here not only enables one to study the specific role of lung endothelial cell apoptosis in the pathogenesis of emphysema but also provides an experimental blueprint to development of a ligand-directed targeted pharmacology in other systems. Animals—Institutional animal care and utilization committees of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and at The Johns Hopkins University approved all animal experiments. BALB/c and C57Bl6/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory, and H-2Kb-tsA58 mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. Cell Culture and Synthetic Peptides—H-2Kb-tsA58 mouse microvascular endothelial cell lines derived from bone marrow, brain, kidney, lung, and prostate (27Langley R.R. Ramirez K.M. Tsan R.Z. Van Arsdall M. Nilsson M.B. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2971-2976PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) at 33 °C. Cells were cultured at 37 °C for at least 48 h to induce a quiescent state. The synthetic peptides CGSPGWVRC, CGSPGWVRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2, and D(KLAKLAK)2 were obtained commercially (AnaSpec; San Jose, CA) to our specifications. In some binding experiments, as indicated, a synthetic cyclic peptide (sequence CARAC) served as an unrelated negative control. For in vivo peptide homing validation, biotin-conjugated CGSPGWVRC and CARAC were also obtained. Cell Surface Binding Assay—We used the BRASIL method (24Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) as described. Briefly, for the screening of the phage display random peptide library for lung endothelial cell binding peptides, 109 transducing units (TU) of CX7C phage library (23Arap W. Kolonin M.G. Trepel M.

The upper aqueous phase was then moved to a new tube with 106 lung endothelial cells and incubated on ice for 2 h. The phage/cell admixture was then centrifuged through the organic phase for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Eppendorf tubes were frozen at -80 °C for at least 10 min, and the bottom of the tube containing the cell pellet was sliced off to a new tube. Cell-bound phage were recovered by Escherichia coli k91kan bacterial infection for 30 min at room temperature, and phage recovery was determined from serial dilution on Luria-Bertani (LB) plates containing tetracycline (40 μg/ml) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml). Recovered phage were amplified in bacterial liquid culture overnight before purification for the subsequent rounds of selection. For the phage binding assays, 109 TU of phage were incubated with 2.5-5 × 105 cells in 1% BSA in DMEM for 2 h on ice and centrifuged through the organic phase for 10 min at 10,000 × g (24Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cell Internalization Assay—Lung and prostate endothelial cells were grown in tissue chamber slides (Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide System; Nalgene Nunc International Corp., Naperville, IL), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated with 109 TU of CGSPGWVRC phage or control phage in 1% BSA in DMEM at 37 °C, and washed five times with PBS and four times with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glycine, pH 2.3, to remove cell surface binding phage. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. Cells were then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of the anti-M13 bacteriophage antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 2 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, mounted, and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. In Vitro Cell Viability and Cell Apoptosis Assays—Cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h in 10% FBS in DMEM, incubated with increasing concentrations of the peptides CGSPGWVRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 or CGSPGWVRC and D(KLAKLAK)2 in 80 μl of 1% FBS in DMEM for 6 hours at 37 °C. After 6 h, cell viability was measured with a cell proliferation detection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (WST-1; Roche Applied Science). All samples were assayed in triplicate. For the detection of cell apoptosis, cells were incubated with 100 μm CGSPGWVRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 or CGSPGWVRC and D(KLAKLAK)2 peptides for 2 h. Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin-V binding (ApoAlert; BD Biosciences) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) (DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system; Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phage Binding Experiments in Vivo and ex Vivo—Avertin®-anesthetized BALB/c mice (0.015 ml/g) were injected intravenously with either 109 TU of CGSPGWVRC-displaying phage or insertless control fd-tet phage (n = 3 mice for each phage clone). Phage were allowed to circulate for 10 min, and the animals were perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with DMEM. The lung and control organs were dissected and homogenized. Homogenates were washed with ice-cold DMEM containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1% BSA. Tissue-bound phage were recovered by infecting log phase k91kan bacteria with the tissue homogenates for 1 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of the infected bacteria were plated on LB plates containing tetracycline (40 μg/ml) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml) to determine the recovered phage titer. Alternatively, anesthetized BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with 1011 TU of CGSPGWVRC-displaying phage or insertless fd-tet phage (n = 3 mice for each phage clone). After 24 h, anesthetized mice were perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with DMEM. Phage were recovered from the tissues as described above. For ex vivo phage binding experiments, lungs or spleen of a PBS-perfused BALB/c mouse were minced and digested with collagenase A (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C. More than 50% of the cells in the lung cell suspension were CD31-positive by flow cytometry (data not shown). The cell suspension was washed twice with 10% FBS in DMEM and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, resulting in single cell suspension. Lung-derived or spleen-derived cells (∼106) were incubated with CGSPGWVRC-displaying phage or control phage (∼109 TU) for 2 h on ice in 1% FBS in DMEM. The cell/phage admixtures were then centrifuged through the organic phase, and cell-bound phage were recovered and titered as described (24Giordano R.J. Cardó-Vila M. Lahdenranta J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For in vivo peptide homing validation, anesthetized BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with 0.2 μmol of biotin-conjugated CGSPGWVRC or CARAC peptides (n = 2 mice for each peptide-biotin). After 2 h, anesthetized mice were perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Peptide-biotin was detected by streptavidinfluorescein (Amersham Biosciences). For blood vessel localization, tissues were co-stained with an anti-CD31 antibody (MEC 13.3) (BD Pharmingen). Treatment of Mice with CGSPGWVRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2—Adult (3 months old) C57Bl6/6J mice received intraperitoneally normal saline solution, 240 μg of CGSPGWVRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 peptide, or 240 μg of CGSPGWVRC and D(KLAKLAK)2 (separately or a 1:1 mixture as indicated) peptides every other day. Treatment was terminated 4 days (n = 2 mice/treatment group, treated with CGSPGWVRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2 or D(KLAKLAK)2), 7 days (for ceramide measurements), or 21 days (n = 5 mice/treatment group, treated with CGSPGWVRC-GG-D(KLAKLAK)2, peptide controls, or saline) after the first peptide administration. Morphologic and Morphometric Analysis—Mice were anesthetized with halothane (Halocarbon Laboratories; North Augusta, SC), and lungs were inflated with 0.5% low melting agarose at a constant pressure of 25 cm of H2O as described (5Kasahara Y. Tuder R.M. Taraseviciene-Stewart L. Le Cras T.D. Abman S. Hirth P.K. Waltenberger J. Voelkel N.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Lungs were then fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded. Tissue sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Mean linear intercepts were measured by computer-assisted morphometry with Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD; utilized for the day 4 experiment) or Metamorph software (Universal Imagining, Frederick, MD). Lung sections were randomly coded, and representative images (15 per lung section) were acquired by an observer masked for the identity of the lungs, at ×20 lens magnification (6Tuder R.M. Zhen L.

TUNEL Assay with Alveolar Epithelial and Endothelial Cell Colocalization—Lung sections (5 μm) from the agarose-inflated lungs were treated by the fluorescein-FragEL DNA fragmentation detection kit (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for the detection of apoptotic cells. Co-localization for type II epithelial cells (surfactant protein C; SpC) or alveolar endothelial cells (CD34) was performed as described (17Rangasamy T. Cho C.Y. Thimmulappa R.K. Zhen L. Srisuma S.S. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Petrache I. Tuder R.M. Biswal S. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Co-localization of TUNEL within alveolar myofibroblasts was performed with anti-smooth muscle cell α-actin immunofluorescence. In brief, slides were prepared as described above and incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-smooth muscle cell α-actin antibody (Sigma) at a 1:25 dilution and detected with the Immunogenex (La Jolla, CA) Mouse-on-Mouse kit with Texas Red as the fluorochrome. Quantification of TUNEL-positive cells co-expressing the selective alveolar cell marker was performed in selected images by an observer masked for the identity of the experimental groups. Total TUNEL-positive/4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI)-positive cells were determined using a macro operation run by the Metamorph imaging system. Detection of Active Caspase-3—Immunohistochemical staining of the active caspase-3 was performed with the active caspase-3-specific antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) on 5-μm lung sections, followed by application of DAPI (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) 1:10,000 from stock in PBS as described (13Kasahara Y.

Quantification of active caspase-3-positive cells was done on images (n = 15 per lung) captured by an observer masked to the identity of the slides. Specifically, quantification was done with the Metamorph software, by measurements of gray color and total intensity of positive staining, after conversion of the original red-green-blue settings to monochrome images. Reduction of background inequalities was done by using an averaging software algorithm, followed by segmentation of the positive signal and measurements based on a relative intensity scale in which the background (with isotype-matched antibody staining) is set to zero and the most intense immunohistochemical signal is set to 256 (256-gray scale). The results were normalized by the total number of cells present in the same microscopic field detected by subsequent image acquisition with the blue filter for DAPI-positive cells. Western blot analysis was performed for whole lung lysates as described (17Rangasamy T. Cho C.Y. Thimmulappa R.K. Zhen L. Srisuma S.S. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Petrache I. Tuder R.M. Biswal S. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Densitometry data were acquired and analyzed by using ImagePro morphometric software as described. Detection of Ceramide Levels—Paraffin-embedded lung sections (5 μm) were incubated with monoclonal anti-ceramide antibody (MID 15B4, Alexis; Axxora LLC, San Diego, CA) by using the DAKO Animal Research Kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) immunohistochemistry protocol. Isotype control IgG served as a negative control. Quantification of ceramide expression was performed on coded images as described for active caspase-3 expression. We also used mass spectroscopy to measure ceramide levels, relying on the concomitant use of ceramide standards followed by normalization per total lipid concentration, as described (10Petrache I.

https://openalex.org/W2147833588,"Blindsight patients, whose primary visual cortex is lesioned, exhibit preserved ability to discriminate visual stimuli presented in their ""blind"" field, yet report no visual awareness hereof. Blindsight is generally studied in experimental investigations of single patients, as very few patients have been given this ""diagnosis"". In our single case study of patient GR, we ask whether blindsight is best described as unconscious vision, or rather as conscious, yet severely degraded vision. In experiment 1 and 2, we successfully replicate the typical findings of previous studies on blindsight. The third experiment, however, suggests that GR's ability to discriminate amongst visual stimuli does not reflect unconscious vision, but rather degraded, yet conscious vision. As our finding results from using a method for obtaining subjective reports that has not previously used in blindsight studies (but validated in studies of healthy subjects and other patients with brain injury), our results call for a reconsideration of blindsight, and, arguably also of many previous studies of unconscious perception in healthy subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2013511212,"Isolates of the Enterobacter cloacae complex have been increasingly isolated as nosocomial pathogens, but phenotypic identification of the E. cloacae complex is unreliable and irreproducible. Identification of species based on currently available genotyping tools is already superior to phenotypic identification, but the taxonomy of isolates belonging to this complex is cumbersome.This study shows that multilocus sequence analysis and comparative genomic hybridization based on a mixed genome array is a powerful method for studying species assignment within the E. cloacae complex. The E. cloacae complex is shown to be evolutionarily divided into two clades that are genetically distinct from each other. The younger first clade is genetically more homogenous, contains the Enterobacter hormaechei species and is the most frequently cultured Enterobacter species in hospitals. The second and older clade consists of several (sub)species that are genetically more heterogeneous. Genetic markers were identified that could discriminate between the two clades and cluster 1.Based on genomic differences it is concluded that some previously defined (clonal and heterogenic) (sub)species of the E. cloacae complex have to be redefined because of disagreements with known or proposed nomenclature. However, further improved identification of the redefined species will be possible based on novel markers presented here."
https://openalex.org/W2083118719,"Advanced age and mutations in the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PS1) are two serious risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Finding common pathogenic changes originating from these risks may lead to a new therapeutic strategy. We observed a decline in memory performance and reduction in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in both mature adult (9-15 months) transgenic APP/PS1 mice and old (19-25 months) non-transgenic (nonTg) mice. By contrast, in the presence of bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, LTP in adult APP/PS1 mice and old nonTg mice was larger than that in adult nonTg mice. The increased LTP levels in bicuculline-treated slices suggested that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition in adult APP/PS1 and old nonTg mice was upregulated. Assuming that enhanced inhibition of LTP mediates memory decline in APP/PS1 mice, we rescued memory deficits in adult APP/PS1 mice by treating them with another GABA(A) receptor antagonist, picrotoxin (PTX), at a non-epileptic dose for 10 days. Among the saline vehicle-treated groups, substantially higher levels of synaptic proteins such as GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit, PSD95, and NR2B were observed in APP/PS1 mice than in nonTg control mice. This difference was insignificant among PTX-treated groups, suggesting that memory decline in APP/PS1 mice may result from changes in synaptic protein levels through homeostatic mechanisms. Several independent studies reported previously in aged rodents both an increased level of GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit and improvement of cognitive functions by long term GABA(A) receptor antagonist treatment. Therefore, reduced LTP linked to enhanced GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition may be triggered by aging and may be accelerated by familial AD-linked gene products like Abeta and mutant PS1, leading to cognitive decline that is pharmacologically treatable at least at this stage of disease progression in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1988994847,"Approximately one-quarter of people over the age of 65 are estimated to suffer some form of cognitive impairment, underscoring the need for effective cognitive-enhancing agents. Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is potentially an innovative target for the development of cognitive enhancers, as its peptide inhibitors exhibit memory-enhancing effects in both normal and memory-impaired rodents. Using a homology model of the catalytic domain of IRAP and virtual screening, we have identified a class of nonpeptide, small-molecule inhibitors of IRAP. Structure-based computational development of an initial ""hit"" resulted in the identification of two divergent families of compounds. Subsequent medicinal chemistry performed on the highest affinity compound produced inhibitors with nanomolar affinities (K(i) 20-700 nM) for IRAP. In vivo efficacy of one of these inhibitors was demonstrated in rats with an acute dose (1 nmol in 1 microl) administered into the lateral ventricles, improving performance in both spatial working and recognition memory paradigms. We have identified a family of specific IRAP inhibitors that is biologically active which will be useful both in understanding the physiological role of IRAP and potentially in the development of clinically useful cognitive enhancers. Notably, this study also provides unequivocal proof of principal that inhibition of IRAP results in memory enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W2032667722,"Leptin controls body weight by activating the long form of the leptin receptor (LEPRb). Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is associated with LEPRb and autophosphorylates in response to leptin. JAK2 also phosphorylates LEPRb, STAT3, and multiple other downstream molecules. Surprisingly, here we show that JAK2 is not required for leptin stimulation of STAT3 phosphorylation. Leptin time- and dose-dependently stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in both human and mouse JAK2-null cells. Leptin also increased the viability of JAK2-null cells. Overexpression of c-Src or Fyn, two Src family members, promoted STAT3 phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of the endogenous Src family members by either pharmacological inhibitors or dominant negative Src(K298M) decreased the ability of leptin to stimulate the phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK1/2. Leptin also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-inactive JAK2(K882E) in JAK2-null cells. Overexpression of JAK2(K882E) enhanced the ability of leptin to stimulate STAT3 phosphorylation in JAK2-null cells. Tyr1138 in LEPRb was required for leptin-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3 but not JAK2(K882E). These data suggest that leptin stimulates non-JAK2 tyrosine kinase(s), including the Src family members, which phosphorylate JAK2, STAT3, and other molecules downstream of LEPRb. JAK2 mediates leptin signaling by both phosphorylating its substrates and forming a signaling complex as a scaffolding/adaptor protein. The non-JAK2 kinase(s) and JAK2 may act coordinately and synergistically to mediate leptin response."
https://openalex.org/W1991382981,"Small RNAs (∼20 to 24 nucleotides) function as naturally occurring molecules critical in developmental pathways in plants and animals [1], [2]. Here we analyze small RNA populations from mature rice grain and seedlings by pyrosequencing. Using a clustering algorithm to locate regions producing small RNAs, we classified hotspots of small RNA generation within the genome. Hotspots here are defined as 1 kb regions within which small RNAs are significantly overproduced relative to the rest of the genome. Hotspots were identified to facilitate characterization of different categories of small RNA regulatory elements. Included in the hotspots, we found known members of 23 miRNA families representing 92 genes, one trans acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) gene, novel siRNA-generating coding genes and phased siRNA generating genes. Interestingly, over 20% of the small RNA population in grain came from a single foldback structure, which generated eight phased 21-nt siRNAs. This is reminiscent of a newly arising miRNA derived from duplication of progenitor genes [3], [4]. Our results provide data identifying distinct populations of small RNAs, including phased small RNAs, in mature grain to facilitate characterization of small regulatory RNA expression in monocot species."
https://openalex.org/W2081593830,"Protein serine/threonine phosphatase 4 (PP4c) is an essential polypeptide involved in critical cellular processes such as microtubule growth and organization, DNA damage checkpoint recovery, apoptosis, and tumor necrosis factor α signaling.

The identification of these regulatory proteins is, therefore, key to fully understanding the function of this enzyme class. Here, using a sensitive affinity purification/mass spectrometry approach, we identify a novel, stable cytosolic PP4c interacting partner, KIAA1622, which we have renamed PP4R4. PP4R4 displays weak sequence homology with the A (scaffolding) subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme and specifically associates with PP4c (and not with the related PP2Ac or PP6c phosphatases).

Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles regulate the activity of most key cellular processes, and misregulation of phosphorylation can have dramatic consequences, such as overproliferation or apoptosis. A major issue in phosphorylation-dependent signaling is the specificity of the process; that is, a given substrate must be phosphorylated (and dephosphorylated) at a specific time and location to properly regulate a given function. Several mechanisms are in place to ensure this specificity; for example, members of the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) 4The abbreviations used are: PPP, phosphoprotein phosphatase; PP4c, catalytic subunit of phosphoprotein phosphatase 4; PP2Ac, catalytic subunit of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; PP2A A, A scaffolding subunit of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; γH2AX, phosphorylated form of the H2A histone variant X; AP, affinity purification; MS, mass spectrometry; EST, expressed sequence tag; HEAT, huntingtin, elongation factor 3, A subunit of PP2A, TOR; TAP, tandem affinity purification; DiFMUP, 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA. family associate with regulatory proteins that confer substrate targeting, subcellular localization, or activation cues (1Janssens V.

PP4c shares >65% identity with PP2Ac but does not associate in significant quantities with the PP2A regulatory subunits.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); of these, at least three appear to bind to PP4c directly (PP4R1, PP4R2, and α4/IGBP1). PP4R1 (also known as PP4Rmeg; gene name PPP4R1), a ∼125-kDa protein co-purifying with PP4c from bovine testis extracts, was the first of the stable interactors to be characterized (12Kloeker S.

We previously employed tandem-affinity purification (TAP) coupled to liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify stable protein assemblies containing PP4c. This approach readily recapitulated the identification of PP4R1, PP4R2, and α4 as PP4c binding partners. In addition, two highly related proteins, which we termed PP4R3A and PP4R3B (gene names SMEK1 and SMEK2), were found as stoichiometric interactors for PP4c·PP4R2.

This work highlighted the utility of affinity purification/mass spectrometry to uncover novel complex assemblies for Ser/Thr phosphatases. The relatively large size of the TAP tag, the lengthy dual purification process, and the sample loss generated as a result of the two purification procedures can, however, affect the recovery of weaker or more transient interactors (22Gingras A.C.

Here, we sought to determine whether additional PP4c interactors could be identified using a single affinity FLAG tag purification strategy. In addition to recapitulating all binding partners previously detected by TAP purification, we identified several novel PP4c interactors, including a previously uncharacterized protein, KIAA1622 (here renamed PP4R4), which resembles the A scaffolding subunit of PP2A. PP4R4 specifically interacts with PP4c in a manner similar to the PP2Ac·PP2A A interaction. However, PP4R4 does not interact with PP4c in concert with other known binding partners but forms a distinct cytoplasmic complex to target PP4c to as yet unknown substrates.

The coding sequence of IκBα (NFKBIA, MGC3942, BC004983) was cloned in-frame in the EcoRI and NotI sites of pcDNA3-3HA. Point mutants of PP4R4 and PP4c were generated by two-step PCR and cloned into BamHI/NotI or EcoRI/NotI sites of pcDNA3-FLAG2, respectively. A portion corresponding to amino acids 751–873 of PP4R4 was cloned in-frame into the BamHI and NotI sites of pGEX-6p2 (GE Healthcare) for expression in bacteria and antibody production. To create pFastBac-FLAG, a 5′ primer containing an RsrII site, an NdeI site, and the sequence for a single FLAG epitope was used to amplify the multiple cloning site (MCS) region of pFastBac HTa (Invitrogen); the 3′ primer was designed to hybridize to the end of the MCS. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the RsrII and XhoI sites of pFastBac HTa, thus replacing the His tag with a FLAG tag. The pFastBac-StreptagII (Strep) was generated using the same strategy, except that the sequence for the Strep-Tactin-binding peptide was used instead of the FLAG sequence. The constructs were sequenced entirely. The coding sequences of PP4R4 and PP4R2 were inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pFastBac-FLAG. The coding sequence of PP4c was cloned in the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pFastBac HTa or pFastBac-StreptagII. The coding sequence of PP4R3A was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pFastBac HTa or pFastBac-StreptagII. Antibodies—Polyclonal antiserum to GST-PP4R4 (rabbit 2) was produced using standard procedures at the animal facility of the University of Toronto. The characterization of the anti-PP4R4 is described below. Rabbit anti-glutathione S-transferase α4 (rabbit 2972, a kind gift from Dr. N. Sonenberg) recognizes a single major band in HEK293 cell extract (not shown). The antiserum to PP4c (rabbit 18335) was raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated C-terminal peptide (PRF&L, Canadensis, PA); this antiserum cross-reacts with PP2Ac by immunoblotting (not shown). Commercial antibodies were as follows: PP4c (Bethyl A300–835A), PP4R2 (Bethyl, A300–838A), PP4R1 (Bethyl, A300–837A), γH2AX P-Ser-139 (Upstate, clone JBW301), FLAG (Sigma, F3165), and HA (CRP Inc., MMS-101R). Secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were donkey anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-rabbit IgG, both conjugated to horseradish-peroxidase (GE Healthcare); for immunofluorescence, a goat anti mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa-488 (Invitrogen, A11001) was utilized. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Leptomycin B Treatment—HEK293, B35 rat neuroblastoma, 293T, and Vero cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Transfections of HEK293, B35, and 293T cells with Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) and Vero cells with Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were collected 48 h post transfection unless otherwise indicated. Where indicated, 30 nm leptomycin B was added to Vero cells 16 h post-transfection, and the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence after the times indicated. Stable cell pools were generated from HEK293 cells as described (18Gingras A.C. Caballero M. Zarske M. Sanchez A. Hazbun T.R. Fields S. Sonenberg N. Hafen E. Raught B. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1725-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the expression was monitored by immunoblotting. Silencing Experiments—Individual siRNA duplexes to silence KIAA1622 were obtained from Qiagen, and the SMARTpool of siRNA duplexes was obtained from Dharmacon. The target siRNAs against PP4R4 are: PP4R4_1, AAGGAACAAGTGTGATTGCAA (catalog #S100459872); PP4R4_2 ACCGGAAGAAATAGAAAGATT (catalog #S100459879); PP4R4_3, CGCGATGGATTTCAGTCAGAA (catalog #S100459886); PP4R4_4, CTGGTCAAGATGTCCAAGGAA (catalog #S100459893). The sequences for each siRNA in the SMART-pool are as follows: GAACAAGTGTGATTGCAAATT, TGAAAGGGCTGTTTATCTGTT, GATTGACAGTCGATGAAGATT, GCGATGGATTTCAGTCAGATT. PP4c siRNA recognizes the sequence GACAATCGACCGAAAGCAATT. HEK293 or U2OS cells were transfected with siRNA (18 nm final concentration) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were collected 40–72 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation from Mouse Brain—One mouse brain (∼0.5 g) was homogenized in lysis buffer (1:10 w/v) containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8340). The homogenate was incubated on ice for 40 min followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. Cleared lysate (7.5 mg per immunoprecipitation) was incubated with either the preimmune or anti-PP4R4 serum at a 1:500 dilution for 2 h. Next, 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 3 h. Three washes in lysis buffer were performed, and the samples were eluted directly in three bead volumes of Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation and Purification from Mammalian Cells—Immunoprecipitation from stably transfected HEK293 cells or transiently transfected 293T cells were performed at 4 °C, as described (23Chen G.I. Gingras A.C. Methods. 2007; 42: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For affinity purification (AP)/mass spectrometry (MS), the immune complexes on anti-FLAG M2 beads (incubation time of 5 h) were washed in lysis buffer then in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 75 mm KCl and 2 mm EDTA and eluted by 3 bead volumes with 0.5 m freshly prepared ammonium hydroxide (pH > 11.0). For immunoprecipitation/Western experiments, the immune complexes (incubation time of 1 h) were washed in lysis buffer and eluted directly in 3 bead volumes of Laemmli sample buffer. Baculovirus Expression and Protein Purification—Baculovirus production was performed using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) instructions. pFastBac constructs were transformed into DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen) to create bacmids containing the genes of interest. Isolated bacmids were transfected into Sf9 cells (using Cellfectin, Invitrogen) for the generation of baculovirus, which were then amplified by infection of fresh Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells were infected with the indicated virus combinations. After 40–60 h, cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and frozen on dry ice. To isolate StreptagII (Strep)-PP4c, Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expressing Strep-PP4c were lysed by syringe lysis with 1 ml per T175 flask of 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1:500 Sigma protease inhibitor mixture. Lysis was confirmed by microscopy, and lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Strep-Tactin-Sepharose (100 μl; IBA 2-1201-010) was added, and the slurry was incubated end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C. The affinity-purified phosphatases were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and twice in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 75 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA. The purified phosphatases on beads were then stored at -20 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 75 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol. Each purification was monitored by colloidal blue staining of proteins resolved on SDS-PAGE. To purify FLAG-tagged proteins, the same protein was used, except that the lysis buffer contained 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8 (rather than Tris), and 60 μl of FLAG M2-agarose beads were used per T175 flask. In some cases FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted by incubating the immune complexes on beads twice for 15–30 min at 4 °C with 50 mm, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with 100 μg/ml 3×-FLAG peptide (Sigma, F4799). Glycerol was then added to a final concentration of 50%, and the phosphatases were stored at -20 °C. Phosphatase Assays—Baculovirus-expressed purified protein phosphatases were pre-equilibrated with phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 10 min at 37 °C. The diluted fluorescent 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) substrate was then added (EnzChek, Invitrogen; final concentration of 60 μm) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5–60 min. Fluorescence was monitored by using a wavelength excitation of 358 nm and emission detection of 455 nm, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphatase assays using the PP4c protein substrate γH2AX were performed under the same buffer, temperature, and incubation time conditions (11Nakada, S., Chen, G. I., Gingras, A.-C., and Durocher, D. (2008) EMBO Rep., in pressGoogle Scholar). The γH2AX substrate was delivered to the phosphatase reaction as acid-extracted histones prepared after γ-irradiation and were a kind gift from Drs. S. Nakada and D. Durocher. Detection of the phosphorylation status of H2AX was performed by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody to γH2AX. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Samples eluted with ammonium hydroxide were lyophilized in a SpeedVac, resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8–8.3), and incubated at 37 °C with trypsin (Sigma trypsin singles; 0.75 μg for 16 h and an additional 0.25 μg for 2 h). The ammonium bicarbonate was evaporated, and the samples were resuspended in high performance liquid chromatography buffer A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) then directly loaded onto capillary columns packed in-house with Magic C18AQ, 5 μm, 100A (18Gingras A.C. Caballero M. Zarske M. Sanchez A. Hazbun T.R. Fields S. Sonenberg N. Hafen E. Raught B. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1725-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectrometry data were acquired in data-dependent mode (over a 65-min to 2-h acetonitrile 2–40% gradient) on a ThermoFinnigan LTQ equipped with a Proxeon NanoSource and an Agilent 1100 capillary pump. Acquired RAW files were converted to mgf format, which were searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Sciences, London, UK) against the human RefSeq data base (release 24) with a precursor ion mass tolerance of 3.0 and a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.8. Methionine oxidation was allowed as a variable modification, and trypsin specificity (with two missed cleavages allowed) was selected. The data were exported into Excel files and manually verified. Biological replicates were analyzed for FLAG-PP4c (n = 6), FLAG-PP4R4 (n = 3), and FLAG alone (n = 3). To generate the lists of high confidence-specific interactors, proteins detected in any of the FLAG-alone samples were subtracted from the final list. For the FLAG-PP4c sample, only those proteins that were detected in all biological replicates and with an averaged Mascot score (sum of Mascot scores across the 6 replicates/6) >250 and >5 averaged unique peptides (sum of unique peptides across the 6 replicates/6) are reported. For FLAG-PP4R4, only those proteins that were detected in all biological replicates and with an averaged Mascot score >250 and averaged unique peptides >2 are reported. The high confidence interactions reported here were submitted to the BioGrid. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown and transfected on glass coverslips; 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed either in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min (followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton-X100 for 5 min) or in cold 90% methanol for 10 min. Fixed cells were washed extensively and blocked with 2% fetal bovine serum followed by incubation with anti-HA.11 antibody (1:1000). Nuclei were visualized by the addition of Hoechst 33342 during the wash before mounting onto a slide. HA-tagged proteins were visualized using Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody. Identification of PP4c-specific Interactors—AP coupled with MS is a robust approach to detect protein-protein interactions surrounding the catalytic subunits of protein serine/threonine phosphatases (18Gingras A.C. Caballero M. Zarske M. Sanchez A. Hazbun T.R. Fields S. Sonenberg N. Hafen E. Raught B. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). To capture novel PP4c interactors that have previously escaped detection, a single-step affinity purification was utilized (23Chen G.I. Gingras A.C. Methods. 2007; 42: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged PP4c was stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Expression levels of FLAG-PP4c were comparable with that of the endogenous protein (Fig. 1A). AP of the tagged protein was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified FLAG-PP4c protein along with its binding partners was eluted from the anti-FLAG resin by incubation with a volatile base (ammonium hydroxide) in the absence of detergents. Eluted proteins were trypsinized and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. As previously reported, identification of specific interacting partners (as opposed to background contaminants) can be extremely difficult, especially when utilizing single step affinity purification (23Chen G.I. Gingras A.C. Methods. 2007; 42: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); a pool of cells expressing the FLAG epitope alone was, therefore, used as a negative control. Each sample (FLAG alone or FLAG-PP4c) was independently analyzed from at least three biological replicates. Importantly, after subtraction of contaminants, FLAG AP/MS recapitulated all interactions previously detected by tandem affinity purification (Table 1, complete MS data in Table S1). Strikingly, however, several additional interactors were also reproducibly detected with this more sensitive method, including KIAA1622 (an uncharacterized protein here renamed PP4R4, see below), PP2A Aα, PP2A B′δ, DHX38, and CCDC6 (Fig. 1B). PP2A Aα and PP2A B′δ are bona fide PP2Ac interactors (25Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). CCDC6 is a coiled-coil domain-containing protein that is a frequent fusion partner for the RET oncogene in thyroid cancer and which has also been linked to apoptosis (26Celetti A. Cerrato A. Merolla F. Vitagliano D. Vecchio G. Grieco M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); the interaction of PP4c and CCDC6 was previously reported, but the significance of this interaction has not been investigated (27Ewing R.M. Chu P. Elisma F. Li H. Taylor P. Climie S. McBroom-Cerajewski L. Robinson M.D. O'Connor L. Li M. Taylor R. Dharsee M. Ho Y. Heilbut A. Moore L. Zhang S. Ornatsky O. Bukhman Y.V. Ethier M. Sheng Y.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2095-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although all of these proteins are potentially interesting, the sequence analysis of PP4R4 (see below) led us to proceed with the characterization of the PP4c·PP4R4 interaction in further detail.TABLE 1Interactors for FLAG-PP4c FLAG-PP4c was stably expressed in HEK293 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2061148382,"The current global efforts to control the morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases affecting developing countries--such as HIV/AIDS, polio, tuberculosis, malaria and the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)-have led to an increasing focus on the biological controllability or eradicability of disease transmission by management action. Here, we use an age-structured dynamical model of lymphatic filariasis transmission to show how a quantitative understanding of the dynamic processes underlying infection persistence and extinction is key to evaluating the eradicability of this macroparasitic disease.We investigated the persistence and extinction dynamics of lymphatic filariasis by undertaking a numerical equilibrium analysis of a deterministic model of parasite transmission, based on varying values of the initial L3 larval density in the system. The results highlighted the likely occurrence of complex dynamics in parasite transmission with three major outcomes for the eradicability of filariasis. First, both vector biting and worm breakpoint thresholds are shown to be complex dynamic entities with values dependent on the nature and magnitude of vector-and host specific density-dependent processes and the degree of host infection aggregation prevailing in endemic communities. Second, these thresholds as well as the potential size of the attractor domains and hence system resilience are strongly dependent on peculiarities of infection dynamics in different vector species. Finally, the existence of multiple stable states indicates the presence of hysteresis nonlinearity in the filariasis system dynamics in which infection thresholds for infection invasion are lower but occur at higher biting rates than do the corresponding thresholds for parasite elimination.The variable dynamic nature of thresholds and parasite system resilience reflecting both initial conditions and vector species-infection specificities, and the existence of hysteresis loop phenomenon, suggests that eradication of filariasis may require taking a more flexible and locally relevant approach to designing elimination programmes compared to the current command and control approach advocated by the global programme."

In response to iron deficiency, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces the expression of the Cth1 and Cth2 mRNA-binding proteins to promote a genome-wide remodeling of cellular metabolism that contributes to the optimal utilization of iron. Cth1 and Cth2 proteins bind to specific AU-rich elements within the 3'-untranslated region of many mRNAs encoding proteins involved in iron-dependent pathways, thereby promoting their degradation. Here, we show that the DEAD box Dhh1 helicase plays a crucial role in the mechanism of Cth2-mediated mRNA turnover. Yeast two-hybrid experiments indicate that Cth2 protein interacts in vivo with the carboxyl-terminal domain of Dhh1. We demonstrate that the degradation of succinate dehydrogenase SDH4 mRNA, a known target of Cth2 on iron-deficient conditions, depends on Dhh1. In addition, we localize the Cth2 protein to cytoplasmic processing bodies in strains defective in the 5′ to 3′ mRNA decay pathway. Finally, the degradation of trapped SDH4 mRNA intermediates by Cth2 supports the 5′ to 3′ directionality of mRNA turnover. Taken together, these results suggest that Cth2 protein recruits the Dhh1 helicase to ARE-containing mRNAs to promote mRNA decay.

All eukaryotes require iron as an essential micronutrient because of its ability to participate as a redox co-factor in a wide range of cellular processes including oxygen transport, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and microbial infections. Although iron is abundant, its bioavailability is highly restricted under aerobic conditions because of the insolubility of ferric hydroxides at physiological pH. In fact, iron deficiency anemia represents the primary nutritional disorder in the world, estimated to affect over two billion people (1Baynes R.D. Bothwell T.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Living organisms have developed sophisticated transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms to optimize iron acquisition and utilization during scarcity (2Kaplan J. McVey Ward D. Crisp R.J.

Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Rutherford J.C.

Optimization of cellular iron utilization is coordinated by two additional Aft1/Aft2 targets: the RNA-binding proteins Cth1 and Cth2 (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J.

In response to iron deficiency, Cth1 and Cth2 promote the degradation of many ARE-containing mRNAs encoding iron-binding proteins or enzymes that participate in metabolic pathways that use iron as a co-factor such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial respiration, heme biosynthesis, and fatty acid synthesis (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).Biochemical and genetic studies on mRNA decay in yeast and mammalian cells have identified two general pathways for mRNA turnover in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 12Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar and 13Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Both pathways initiate with the shortening of the poly(A) tail by the major cytoplasmic Ccr4/Pop2/Not deadenylase complex. Deadenylation can be followed by 3′ to 5′ mRNA degradation by a large complex of exonucleases known as the exosome. Alternatively, the 5′ cap structure can be removed by the decapping enzyme complex Dcp1/Dcp2, followed by 5′ to 3′ digestion of the transcript body by the Xrn1 cytoplasmic exonuclease.The conserved Dhh1/RCK/p54 protein, which functions as an activator of decapping, plays a critical function in modulating and connecting mRNA translation and turnover (14Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The recent elucidation of Dhh1 crystal structure has revealed that, like other previously characterized DEAD box proteins, Dhh1 contains two RecA-like α/β domains (14Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), referred to as the amino-terminal (Dhh1-Nt) and carboxyl-terminal (Dhh1-Ct) domains. The Dhh1-Nt domain contains ATP-binding and hydrolysis motifs, whereas the Dhh1-Ct domain exhibits motifs associated with RNA binding (14Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structure of Dhh1 and the functional analysis of different Dhh1 mutants indicate that ATP and RNA binding induce a conformational change that leads to a more compact structure with extensive interactions between the Dhh1-Nt and Dhh1-Ct domains (14Cheng Z. Coller J. Parker R. Song H. RNA. 2005; 11: 1258-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Importantly, the Dhh1-Ct domain physically interacts with the Dcp1/Dcp2 decapping complex and the Edc3 scaffold protein, thereby promoting the transition of mRNAs from translation to decapping and 5′ to 3′ degradation at specific intracellular sites known as processing bodies (P-bodies) (15Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 16Sheth U. Parker R.

Conserved core proteins of P-bodies include Dcp1/Dcp2, Dhh1, Edc3, Xrn1, the translation repressor Pat1 and the heptameric Lsm1-7 complex. The cross-bridging protein Edc3 and the “prion-like” domain in Lsm4 mediate the aggregation of individual mRNPs into larger P-body assemblies (17Decker C.J. Teixeira D. Parker R. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the assembly of the general repression/decay complexes in P-bodies is in competition with the assembly of translational factors (reviewed in Refs. 18Parker R. Sheth U. Mol.

Inhibition of mRNA decay at late stages (xrn1Δ, dcp1Δ, dcp2Δ, and lsm1Δ mutants) or blockage of translation initiation (glucose deprivation and osmotic stress) dramatically increases the number and size of P-bodies, whereas an inhibition of mRNA turnover at earlier steps (ccr4Δ, pop2Δ, dhh1Δ and pat1Δ mutants) traps mRNAs in polysomes and decreases visible P-bodies (15Coller J.

Multiple proteins that participate at different levels in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA expression, including proteins involved in non-sense-mediated decay or proteins that regulate subclasses of mRNAs, rapidly transit through P-bodies and only accumulate at detectable levels in certain mutant backgrounds, when overexpressed or under stressful conditions (reviewed in Refs. 18Parker R.

Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar).Recent results have shown that some mRNA-specific regulatory proteins recruit the general repression and decay machinery to specific transcripts. In yeast, the PUF family member protein Mpt5 interacts with the Pop2 deadenylase, thereby inducing the recruitment of the Ccr4, Dhh1, and Dcp2 proteins to individual mRNAs to promote mRNA deadenylation and decay (23Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Human tristetraprolin (TTP), a well characterized member of the family of proteins containing TZF of the CX8CX5CX3H-type, promotes the rapid decay of some ARE-containing mRNAs encoding for cytokines and interleukins (reviewed in Ref. 24Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The identification of mRNA decay factors that associate with TTP and different mRNA decay assays suggests that TTP promotes mRNA turnover by recruiting the mRNA decay enzymes responsible for deadenylation, decapping, and 5′ to 3′ turnover, as well as 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic degradation (25Lai W.S.

An unresolved issue is the diversity of interactions that allow mRNA specific-binding proteins to recruit the mRNA degradation machinery.In this report, we provide novel information on the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that control the adaptation of eukaryotic cells to iron deficiency. Despite the important function played in yeast by the RNA-binding proteins Cth1 and Cth2 in this process, their mechanism for targeted mRNA degradation is currently unknown. Here, we provide genetic and molecular evidence, including mRNA decay assays and protein-protein interaction experiments, that point to a function for the DEAD box Dhh1 helicase in the mechanism of Cth2-mediated mRNA decay. Furthermore, the analysis of trapped intermediates during mRNA degradation and the localization of Cth2 protein to P-bodies in specific mRNA decay mutants suggest that, in response to iron deficiency, Cth2 promotes mRNA by the 5′ to 3′ decay pathway. These results contribute to further understand the multiple mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional regulation of ARE-containing mRNAs in eukaryotic cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Genotypes for the yeast strains used in this work are listed in supplemental Table S1. To test the effect of CTH2 overexpression on yeast growth rate, cells were grown on SC-ura (synthetic medium without uracil and containing 2% glucose) to exponential phase (∼A600 = 0.3-0.6), washed, and spotted in 10-fold serial dilutions starting at A600 = 0.1 on SC-ura and SCGal-ura (SC without uracil, without glucose, and containing 2% galactose), and incubated at 30 °C for 3-4 days. For yeast two-hybrid assays, AH109 cells co-transformed with GAD- and GBD-based plasmids were grown in SC-leu-trp (SC without leucine and tryptophan) to exponential phase and spotted in 10-fold serial dilutions on SC-leu-trp (+His), SC-leu-trp-his (SC without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine) with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (-His), and SC-adenine, and incubated at 30 °C for 3-5 days.Plasmids—Plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. The coding sequences from wild type CTH2 and CTH2-C190R were cloned into the p416GAL vector using standard cloning methods. The pRS416-CTH2-C190R plasmid (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) was used as a template for CTH2-C190R PCR amplification. The entire coding region of DHH1, the amino-terminal DHH1 region (amino acid residues 1-248), and the carboxyl-terminal DHH1 region (amino acid residues 249-507) were cloned in frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of the pGBK-T7 plasmid (Matchmaker, BD Biosciences), generating the pGBK-DHH1, pGBK-DHH1-Nt, and pGBK-DHH1-Ct plasmids, respectively. The CTH1 coding region was cloned in frame with the Gal4-activating domain of the pGAD-T7 plasmid (BD Biosciences) generating the pGAD-CTH1 plasmid. The p416GAL-SDH4pG plasmid was obtained in two steps; first, 218 nucleotides from the SDH4 3′-UTR were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pRS416 vector (the poly(G) track was included within the forward oligonucleotide), and second, a fragment containing the GAL1 promoter and the SDH4 coding sequence from p416GAL-SDH4 plasmid was cloned in. GFP was introduced in frame after the CTH2 start codon of pRS416-CTH2 plasmid (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) to generate pRS416-GFP-CTH2. All of the PCR amplifications were performed with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science), and plasmids were verified by sequencing.RNA Isolation and Analysis in Agarose Gels—For steady-state mRNA analysis (see Fig. 2A), the cells were grown in SC-ura-leu (SC lacking uracil and leucine) containing 100 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (+Fe) or 100 μm of the iron chelator bathophenantholine disulfonic acid or BPS (-Fe) to exponential phase. For half-life measurements, the cells were grown overnight in SCRaf-ura-leu (no glucose and 2% raffinose) and reinoculated in the same medium containing 100 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (+Fe) or 100 μm BPS (-Fe) to exponential phase. Galactose was added at a final concentration of 4% for 2 h. Finally, 4% glucose was added to terminate transcription of SDH4 mRNA. Aliquots were isolated before galactose addition, and at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20 min after transcription shut-off. Total yeast RNA was isolated with a modified hot phenol method and analyzed on a 1.5% formaldehyde agarose gel as previously described (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified fragments were gel-purified and radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP to be used as probes. The samples were analyzed by RNA blotting with SDH4 and ACT1 probes and quantified with a FLA-3000R phosphorimaging device (Fujifilm). SDH4 values were normalized with ACT1 values. The half-life was determined as the average of at least three independent experiments, and standard deviation was calculated.RNA Isolation and Analysis in Polyacrylamide Gels—The cells were grown in SC-ura-leu containing 100 μm Fe(NH4)2-(SO4)2 (+Fe) or 100 μm BPS (-Fe) to the exponential phase. Total yeast RNA was isolated and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide, 7.5 m urea gels as described (31He W. Parker R. Methods. 1999; 17: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The SDH4:437R (5′-AAAGGGAGACCGCAGAACCAAG-3′) oligonucleotide and oligo(dT) were used for RNase H digestions. End-labeled SDH4cds (5′-GTCTTTCTCGGAAGAATCCCA-3′) and SDH4-3UTR (5′-GATGTGCATGTTACATGACCGA-3′) oligonucleotides were used as SDH4 probes, upstream and downstream of the poly(G) track, respectively; and the oRP100 oligonucleotide was used as a probe for the SCR1 loading control. The images were obtained with a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) phosphorimaging device.Fluorescence Microscopy—For GFP-Cth2 and Dcp2-RFP subcellular localization, the cells were grown in selective medium with 100 μm BPS to early exponential phase (A600 = 0.3-0.4). The images were acquired with a Nikon PCM 2000 confocal microscope (Melville, NY) using a 100× objective with a3× zoom using Compix software (Sewickley, PA). The images in Fig. 5A are a z-series compilation of 6-10 images in a stack. Co-localization experiments (see Fig. 5B) are made from a single z-plane image.FIGURE 5Cth2 protein is trapped within processing-bodies in xrn1Δ, dcp1Δ, and dcp2Δ mutant cells.

The transcription of both genes is induced by the iron-regulated transcription factors Aft1 and Aft2 (7Shakoury-Elizeh M. Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O.

Although Cth2 protein is undetectable under iron-sufficient conditions and highly expressed upon iron starvation, Cth1 protein levels are low but transiently induced during iron deficiency (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 11Puig S. Vergara S.V. Thiele D.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Previous results have shown that overexpression of Cth1 or Cth2 proteins under iron-sufficient conditions impairs cell growth (33Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of a region containing the CX8CX5CX3H TZF motif within Cth1 protein rescues cell growth to wild type rates (33Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To reproduce these observations, we have cloned the CTH2 coding sequence under the control of the glucose-repressible and galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter (pGAL-CTH2 plasmid). As expected, no difference in growth rate is observed between wild type cells transformed with pGAL-CTH2 and p416GAL empty vector when grown on glucose-containing medium, whereas a significant growth defect is observed for wild type cells expressing pGAL-CTH2 in galactose-containing medium (Fig. 1). We have previously reported that mutagenesis of a single cysteine residue (C190R) within Cth2 TZF motif severely reduces RNA binding and degradation of Cth2 mRNA targets (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the CTH2-C190R mutant allele under the control of the GAL1 promoter does not induce growth defects on galactose-containing medium as compared with wild type cells harboring empty vector (Fig. 1). These results strongly suggest that impaired growth caused by CTH2 overexpression is a consequence of specific binding of the Cth2 protein to target mRNAs.FIGURE 1Growth impairment caused by CTH2 overexpression is rescued in dhh1Δ mutant cells. Wild type BY4741 and dhh1Δ cells transformed with p416GAL, p416GAL-CTH2 (pGAL-CTH2), and p416GAL-CTH2-C190R (pGAL-CTH2-C190R) were assayed for growth on SC-ura (Glucose) and SCGal-ura (Galactose) media.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)With the aim to identify proteins that might be required for the mechanism of Cth2-mediated mRNA degradation, we have assayed the effect of CTH2 overexpression on the growth rate of yeast strains lacking proteins previously shown to be involved in mRNA turnover. Single deletions in the POP2 and PAN2 deadenylases; EDC1, EDC2, and EDC3 decapping enhancers; PAT1 and LSM1 translation regulators; XRN1 5′-3′ exonuclease; the SKI2 cytosolic subunit of the exosome; and the RRP6 nuclear subunit of the exosome exhibited growth impairment when CTH2 was overexpressed, as previously shown for wild type cells (data not shown). Importantly, deletion of the DEAD box RNA helicase DHH1 rescued cell growth impairment caused by CTH2 overexpression (Fig. 1), suggesting that Dhh1 protein plays a role in the mechanism of Cth2-mediated mRNA turnover.Dhh1 Is Required for the Degradation of SDH4 mRNA in Iron-deficient Conditions—We have previously described that Cth2 protein specifically binds to AREs within the 3′-UTR of SDH4 mRNA and promotes its specific degradation in response to iron starvation (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). With the aim to ascertain the function of Dhh1 RNA-helicase in the mechanism of Cth2-induced turnover upon iron starvation, we have determined the steady-state mRNA levels of SDH4 mRNA in wild type CTH2, cth2Δ, and dhh1Δ cells, growth under iron-sufficient (+Fe) and iron-deficient (-Fe) conditions. Given the partially overlapping function of Cth1 and Cth2 proteins in mRNA degradation (11Puig S. Vergara S.V. Thiele D.J. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we have performed these experiments in cells lacking the CTH1 gene (cth1Δ background). As previously described, steady-state SDH4 mRNA levels decrease in wild type CTH2 cells grown under iron-deficient conditions, whereas no mRNA down-regulation is observed in cth2Δ cells (Fig. 2A and Ref. 10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). dhh1Δ mutant cells grown under iron-sufficient conditions do not display any significant change in SDH4 mRNA levels with respect to wild type and cth2Δ mutant cells; and more importantly, SDH4 mRNA levels do not decrease under iron-deficient conditions (Fig. 2A). Because CTH2 induction by iron deficiency is not affected in dhh1Δ mutant cells (Fig. 2A), these results indicate that Dhh1 is required for the down-regulation of SDH4 mRNA upon iron limitation.To further investigate the function of Dhh1 protein in the post-transcriptional regulation of SDH4 mRNA, we have determined SDH4 mRNA half-life under iron-sufficient and iron-deficient conditions in dhh1Δ mutant cells as compared with wild type CTH2 and cth2Δ cells. Again, CTH1 gene has been deleted from these strains to avoid any overlapping effect with CTH2 function. The SDH4 coding sequence and 3′-UTR have been conditionally expressed with the GAL1 promoter. The cells were transiently grown in galactose to induce the expression of SDH4 mRNA, and glucose was added to shut off SDH4 transcription. The samples were processed and analyzed to determine SDH4 mRNA levels at different time points. As previously described (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), wild type CTH2 cells grown under iron-sufficient conditions exhibit a longer SDH4 mRNA half-life than cells grown under iron-deficient conditions (Fig. 2, B and C, 14.5 versus 8.3 min). No significant change in SDH4 mRNA half-life is observed for cth2Δ cells grown under plus and minus iron conditions (Fig. 2, B and C, 15.4 versus 15.0 min) (10Puig S. Askeland E. Thiele D.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). dhh1Δ cells grown under iron sufficiency showed a half-life of 15.3 min, which is similar to the values obtained for wild type CTH2 and cth2Δ cells under iron sufficiency (Fig. 2, B and C). SDH4 mRNA half-life did not significantly decrease in dhh1Δ mutants when CTH2 expression was induced by growth under iron deficiency (Fig. 2, B and C, 14.2 min), suggesting that DHH1 is important for the regulation of SDH4 mRNA stability durin"
https://openalex.org/W2067344044,"Staphylococcus aureus scavenges heme-iron from host hemoproteins using iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins. IsdC is the central conduit through which heme is passed across the cell wall and binds this molecule using a NEAr Transporter (NEAT) domain. NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the structure of IsdC in complex with a heme analog, zinc-substituted protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX). The backbone coordinates of the ensemble of conformers representing the structure exhibit a root mean square deviation to the mean structure of 0.53 ± 0.11Å. IsdC partially buries protoporphyrin within a large hydrophobic pocket that is located at the end of itsβ-barrel structure. The central metal ion of the analog adopts a pentacoordinate geometry in which a highly conserved tyrosine residue serves as a proximal ligand. Consistent with the structure and its role in heme transfer across the cell wall, we show that IsdC weakly binds heme (KD = 0.34 ± 0.12 μm) and that ZnPPIX rapidly dissociates from the protein at a rate of 126 ± 30 s-1. NMR studies of the apo-form of IsdC reveal that a 310 helix within the binding pocket undergoes a flexible to rigid transition as heme is captured.

Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic Gram-positive pathogen that causes lethal infections such as toxic shock syndrome, meningitis, and endocarditis (1Casey A.L. Lambert P.A. Elliott T.S. Int.

The bacterium needs the essential nutrient iron to grow and although the human body contains large quantities of this metal, little is directly available to S. aureus as it is sequestered intracellularly (3Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar) or bound to transferrin and lactoferrin (4Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu.

A group of newly discovered proteins called iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins then scavenge heme and transfer it into the cytoplasm where it is degraded to liberate iron (8Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. BioMetals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Reniere M.L. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. BioMetals. 2007; 20: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

Proteins homologous to IsdC are also present in a number of other important human pathogens (Bacillus anthracis and Listeria monocytogenes) (6Maresso A.W. Chapa T.J. Schneewind O. J.

In Gram-negative bacteria, the process of heme-iron acquisition is reasonably well understood. Heme is captured from hemoproteins or hemophore-hemoprotein complexes by specific outer membrane receptors (5Wilks A. Burkhard K.A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is then transferred into the periplasm in a Ton-B-dependent manner, where it is moved across the inner membrane by specific ABC-dependent permeases (5Wilks A. Burkhard K.A. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Heme acquisition mechanisms used by Gram-positive bacteria are only beginning to be understood. In several species, heme is directly imported into the cytoplasm by ABC transporters positioned in the membrane (Corynebacterium diphtheriae (HemTUV), Streptococcus pyogenes (HtsABC), and S. aureus (HtsABC)) (12Drazek E.S.

To more effectively capture heme, some pathogens supplement these transporters with cell wall-associated proteins that bind host hemoproteins (5Wilks A. Burkhard K.A. Nat. Prod.

In S. pyogenes, the cell wall-associated hemoprotein Shp passes heme to the lipoprotein component of an ABC transporter through direct protein-protein interactions (13Nygaard T.K. Blouin G.C. Liu M.

S. aureus uses a more elaborate system to acquire heme in which an array of different Isd proteins bind heme, hemoglobin, and the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex (8Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. BioMetals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). They then pass heme across the cell wall and membrane into the cytoplasm where it is degraded to release iron (8Maresso A.W.

The S. aureus Isd determinant system consists of nine proteins that mediate the delivery of heme-bound iron into the cytoplasm (17Skaar E.P. Schneewind O. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Three Isd proteins are attached to the cell wall by the SrtA sortase: IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH (8Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. BioMetals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These receptors bind to other proteins and heme. IsdH and IsdB presumably capture heme-laden Hb released from erythrocytes after lysis by hemolysins (8Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. BioMetals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The IsdH protein binds Hb, the serum glycoprotein haptoglobin (Hp), and the Hb·Hp complex (18Pilpa R.M. Fadeev E.A. Villareal V.A. Wong M.L. Phillips M. Clubb R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similar to IsdH, the IsdB protein binds Hb, but is incapable of binding Hp (20Torres V.J. Pishchany G. Humayun M. Schneewind O. Skaar E.P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8421-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). IsdA may function in bacterial adhesion as it interacts with a range of extracellular matrix proteins (21Clarke S.R. Wiltshire M.D. Foster S.J. Mol.

It is thought to function as the central conduit through which heme is passed across the cell wall to the membrane IsdDEF complex, which pumps heme across the membrane (8Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. BioMetals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Once inside the cell, iron is liberated from heme by the IsdG monoxygenase, or its paralog, IsdI (16Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H.

Recent studies have also shown that captured heme can be directly incorporated into microbial proteins (14Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T. DeBord K.L. Schneewind O. Science. 2004; 305: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The cell wall receptors of the Isd system (IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdH) contain one or more NEAT domains (NEAr Transporter domains), a ∼125 residue motif found in proteins encoded by genes that are frequently proximal to Fe3+ siderophore transporter genes (26Andrade M.A. Ciccarelli F.D. Perez-Iratxeta C. Bork P. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0047)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amazingly, NEAT domains exhibit a wide-range of ligand binding specificities. For example, some domains only bind proteins (e.g. the first and second NEAT domains within IsdH) (19Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), some may only bind heme (e.g. third NEAT domain from IsdH or IsdC), 6R. M. Pilpa, S. A. Robson, V. A. Villareal, M. L. Wong, M. Phillips, and R. T. Clubb, submitted for publication. 6R. M. Pilpa, S. A. Robson, V. A. Villareal, M. L. Wong, M. Phillips, and R. T. Clubb, submitted for publication. whereas others may bind both of these ligands (e.g. IsdA) (14Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T. DeBord K.L. Schneewind O.

Recent NMR and x-ray crystallography studies have revealed that NEAT domains adopt an immunoglobin-like fold, although they share no significant primary sequence homology with members of this family (18Pilpa R.M.

To gain insight into how IsdC transports heme across the cell wall, we determined the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of its NEAT domain (IsdCN) in complex with zinc-substituted protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX). We show that IsdCN recognizes ZnPPIX through a large cleft located at the end of its β-barrel structure in which the zinc ion is bound in a pentacoordinate manner by a highly conserved tyrosine residue. In contrast to previously characterized NEAT domains, NMR measurements indicate that binding occurs through an induced-fit mechanism. This structural plasticity may increase the efficiency of heme transfer by facilitating interactions with upstream hemoproteins. Protein Purification and NMR Sample Preparation—The gene sequence encoding the IsdC NEAT (IsdCN) domain was cloned into pET15b (Novagen) using standard methods. This generated an expression plasmid that produces the NEAT domain within IsdC (residues Ser25 to Gly150 containing the additional sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM at its N terminus). Isotopically labeled protein was produced from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells grown at 37 °C. The cell culture consisted of M9 minimal media that was supplemented with either 15NH4Cl, or both 15NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose as previously described (30Ilangovan U. Wojciak J.M. Connolly K.M. Clubb R.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8367-8376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When the cells reached a density of ∼0.6 A600 units they were induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were then harvested after 4 h by centrifugation at 8,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a JA-10 rotor. The pellet was then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 300 mm NaCl (pH 7), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm protease inhibitor mixture II (Calbiochem)) and lysed by sonication. The lysed sample was then centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a JA-20 rotor. The soluble fraction was then incubated with Talon beads (Clontech) for 45 min. After washing the column, the protein was eluted in the following buffer: 30 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole (pH 7). Fractions containing protein were then pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 m urea (pH 5.1). The sample was then applied to a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow XK-50 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with SP-buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m urea, pH 5.1). IsdCN was then eluted using a 0–1 m gradient of NaCl dissolved in SP-buffer. Peaks containing IsdCN were pooled and dialyzed against NMR buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% sodium azide (pH 6)). The results of a pyridine hemochrome assay indicate that only ∼3% of purified IsdCN contained heme (31Lei B. Liu M. Voyich J.M. Prater C.I. Kala S.V. DeLeo F.R. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5962-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This form of the protein is hereafter referred to as apoIsdCN. Complexes containing IsdCN bound to ZnPPIX were studied by NMR. The complexes contain a 1:1 ratio of IsdCN and ZnPPIX (IsdCN·ZnPPIX complex). Complexes containing either 15Nor 15N- and 13C-labeled IsdCN dissolved in NMR buffer were prepared by adding small aliquots of a stock solution of ZnPPIX (50 mm ZnPPIX dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH) to a solution of apoIsdCN. The pH of the solution after each addition of ZnPPIX was adjusted and the progress of complex formation was monitored by recording a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra. All samples containing ZnPPIX were shielded from light to prevent degradation. Concentrated samples for NMR studies were produced using a centriprep filter device (Amicon; YM-10). The NMR samples contained 1.1 mm of the IsdCN·ZnPPIX complex. One sample was dissolved in H2O and NMR buffer, and contained 7% D2O. A 1:1 IsdCN:ZnPPIX dissolved in D2O was also produced by freeze-drying the complex dissolved in NMR buffer, followed by resuspension with an equal volume of 99.999% D2O.

Two-dimensional (Hβ)Cβ(CγCδCϵ)Hϵ and two-dimensional (Hβ)Cβ(CγCδ)Hδ experiments were used to facilitate aromatic side chain assignments (37Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The program TALOS was used to obtain ϕ and Ψ dihedral angle restraints (38Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Stereospecific assignment of methylene protons were obtained by analyzing three-dimensional 15N-edited ROESY, HNHB, and 15N-edited TOCSY (35 ms mixing time) spectra. Distance restraints were identified in three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra of the complex. A two-dimensional (F1 and F2 13C filtered) NOESY (39Iwahara J. Wojciak J.M. Clubb R.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) spectra was used to assign the proton chemical shifts of the ZnPPIX molecule in the complex. Intermolecular NOEs between IsdC and ZnPPIX were identified by analyzing three-dimensional (F1) 13C,15N-filtered, (F2) 13C-edited NOESY, three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY, and two-dimensional (F2 13C-filtered) NOESY (39Iwahara J.

The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial, First Ed. CANTINA Verlag, Goldav, Switzerland2004Google Scholar) and PIPP (42Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar) software packages. Structure calculations were performed using the programs ATNOS/CANDID (43Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 44Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J Biomol.

Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Initially, only the structure of IsdCN in the complex was determined using ATNOS/CANDID. Input into this program included the amino acid sequence, chemical shifts obtained from sequence-specific assignments, and three NOESY experiments: an 15N-edited NOESY (mixing time 125 ms), an aliphatic 13C-edited NOESY (mixing time 125 ms, 13C carrier at 35 ppm), and 13C-edited NOESY spectrum optimized for aromatic residues (mixing time 120 ms, 13C carrier at 100 ppm). Dihedral angle restraints determined by TALOS were also included at the start of the calculations. The boundaries for these restraints were set to ±30° or three times the standard deviation reported by TALOS, whichever value was larger. The standard CANDID protocol of seven cycles of peak identification and assignment, followed by structure calculations, was executed. This process assigned the vast majority of cross-peaks in the NOESY data and produced a set of conformers that converged to the structure of the IsdCN protein in the complex. Subsequently, the NMR data were manually inspected to identify additional NOE distance restraints, including a total of 31 intermolecular distances. Hydrogen bond restraints were derived from analysis of NOE patterns from secondary structure analysis. In calculations carried out at the final stages of refinement, the side chain of Tyr132 chain was invariably proximal to the central zinc ion of the protoporphyrin ring, however, the distance between the hydroxyl oxygen and metal was slightly larger than predicted from high resolution crystal structures of other protein-protoporphyrin complexes. We therefore elected to include a single artificial distance restraint that holds the hydroxyl oxygen and the zinc atoms within 2.2 Å of one another. No significant structural changes are produced with the addition of this restraint and structures calculated using this restraint completely satisfied all of the experimental NMR data. The final structure of the complex was calculated using these additional restraints using the program XPLOR-NIH. A total of 200 conformers were produced. The structure of the complex is represented by 30 conformers that have the lowest overall energy. Statistics for the structure of the IsdCN·ZnPPIX complex are presented in Table 1.

https://openalex.org/W2038638188,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expressed by germinal center B cells is a central regulator of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). Humans with AID mutations develop not only the autosomal recessive form of hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2) associated with B cell hyperplasia, but also autoimmune disorders by unknown mechanisms. We report here that AID−/− mice spontaneously develop tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) in non-lymphoid tissues including the stomach at around 6 months of age. At a later stage, AID−/− mice develop a severe gastritis characterized by loss of gastric glands and epithelial hyperplasia. The disease development was not attenuated even under germ-free (GF) conditions. Gastric autoantigen -specific serum IgM was elevated in AID−/− mice, and the serum levels correlated with the gastritis pathological score. Adoptive transfer experiments suggest that autoimmune CD4+ T cells mediate gastritis development as terminal effector cells. These results suggest that abnormal B-cell expansion due to AID deficiency can drive B-cell autoimmunity, and in turn promote TLO formation, which ultimately leads to the propagation of organ-specific autoimmune effector CD4+ T cells. Thus, AID plays an important role in the containment of autoimmune diseases by negative regulation of autoreactive B cells."

The transcription factor Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) is a key regulator of inflammation and apoptosis. We presently evaluated the function of the AP-1 subunit JunB in cytokine-mediated beta-cell dysfunction and death. The cytokines IL-1beta+IFN-gamma induced an early and transitory upregulation of JunB by NF-kappaB activation. Knockdown of JunB by RNA interference increased cytokine-mediated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, leading to increased apoptosis in an insulin-producing cell line (INS-1E) and in purified rat primary beta-cells. JunB knockdown beta-cells and junB(-/-) fibroblasts were also more sensitive to the chemical ER stressor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). Conversely, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of JunB diminished iNOS and ER markers expression and protected beta-cells from cytokine-induced cell death.

Cloned antibody therapeutics hold considerable promise as BoNT therapeutics, but the therapeutic utility of antibodies that bind the BoNT light chain domain (LC), a metalloprotease that functions in the cytosol of cholinergic neurons, has not been thoroughly explored. Methods and Findings We used an optimized hybridoma method to clone a fully human antibody specific for the LC of serotype A BoNT (BoNT/A). The 4LCA antibody demonstrated potent in vivo neutralization when administered alone and collaborated with an antibody specific for the HC. In Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells, the 4LCA antibody prevented the cleavage of the BoNT/A proteolytic target, SNAP-25. Unlike an antibody specific for the HC, the 4LCA antibody did not block entry of BoNT/A into cultured cells. Instead, it was taken up into synaptic vesicles along with BoNT/A. The 4LCA antibody also directly inhibited BoNT/A catalytic activity in vitro. Conclusions An antibody specific for the BoNT/A LC can potently inhibit BoNT/A in vivo and in vitro, using mechanisms not previously associated with BoNT-neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies specific for BoNT LC may be valuable components of an antibody antidote for BoNT exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2078128563,"Hantaviruses are globally important human pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Capillary leakage is central to hantaviral diseases, but how it develops, has remained unknown. It has been hypothesized that the pathogenesis of hantavirus infection would be a complex interplay between direct viral effects and immunopathological mechanisms. Both of these were studied in the so far best model of mild hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, i.e. cynomolgus macaques infected with wild-type Puumala hantavirus. Viral RNA detected by in situ hybridization and nucleocapsid protein detected by immunohistochemical staining were observed in kidney, spleen and liver tissues. Inflammatory cell infiltrations and tubular damage were found in the kidneys, and these infiltrations contained mainly CD8-type T-cells. Importantly, these results are consistent with those obtained from patients with hantaviral disease, thus showing that the macaque model of hantavirus infection mimics human infection also on the tissue level. Furthermore, both the markers of viral replication and the T-cells appeared to co-localize in the kidneys to the sites of tissue damage, suggesting that these two together might be responsible for the pathogenesis of hantavirus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2096864450,"The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes participate in a wide range of biochemical functions, including metabolism of arachidonic acid and steroid hormones. Mouse CYP2J5 is abundant in the kidney where its products, the cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), modulate sodium transport and vascular tone. To define the physiological role of CYP2J5 in the kidney, knockout mice were generated using a conventional gene targeting approach. Cyp2j5 (-/-) mice develop normally and exhibit no overt renal pathology. While renal EET biosynthesis was apparently unaffected by the absence of CYP2J5, deficiency of this CYP in female mice was associated with increased blood pressure, enhanced proximal tubular transport rates, and exaggerated afferent arteriolar responses to angiotensin II and endothelin I. Interestingly, plasma 17beta-estradiol levels were reduced in female Cyp2j5 (-/-) mice and estrogen replacement restored blood pressure and vascular responsiveness to normal levels. There was no evidence of enhanced estrogen metabolism, or altered expression or activities of steroidogenic enzymes in female Cyp2j5 (-/-) mice, but their plasma levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone were inappropriately low. Together, our findings illustrate a sex-specific role for CYP2J5 in regulation of blood pressure, proximal tubular transport, and afferent arteriolar responsiveness via an estrogen-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2107891892,"Expression of the mu opioid receptor (MOR1) protein is regulated temporally and spatially. Although transcription of its gene has been studied extensively, regulation of MOR1 protein production at the level of translation is poorly understood. Using reporter assays, we found that the MOR1 3'-untranslated region (UTR) represses reporter expression at the post-transcriptional level. Suppression by the 3'-UTR of MOR1 is mediated through decreased mRNA association with polysomes, which requires microRNA23b (miRNA23b), a specific miRNA that is expressed in mouse brain and NS20Y mouse neuroblastoma cells. miRNA23b interacts with the MOR1 3'-UTR via a K box motif. By knocking down endogenous miRNA23b in NS20Y cells, we confirmed that miRNA23b inhibits MOR1 protein expression in vivo. This is the first study reporting a translationally repressive role for the MOR1 3'-UTR. We propose a mechanism in which miRNA23b blocks the association of MOR1 mRNA with polysomes, thereby arresting its translation and suppressing the production of MOR1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2062115081,"The evolution of ANTP genes in the Metazoa has been the subject of conflicting hypotheses derived from full or partial gene sequences and genomic organization in higher animals. Whole genome sequences have recently filled in some crucial gaps for the basal metazoan phyla Cnidaria and Porifera. Here we analyze the complete genome of Trichoplax adhaerens, representing the basal metazoan phylum Placozoa, for its set of ANTP class genes. The Trichoplax genome encodes representatives of Hox/ParaHox-like, NKL, and extended Hox genes. This repertoire possibly mirrors the condition of a hypothetical cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. The evolution of the cnidarian and bilaterian ANTP gene repertoires can be deduced by a limited number of cis-duplications of NKL and “extended Hox” genes and the presence of a single ancestral “ProtoHox” gene."
https://openalex.org/W2024952866,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting the motor neurons. The majority of familial forms of ALS are caused by mutations in the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In mutant SOD1 spinal cord motor neurons, mitochondria develop abnormal morphology, bioenergetic defects, and degeneration. However, the mechanisms of mitochondrial toxicity are still unclear. One possibility is that mutant SOD1 establishes aberrant interactions with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, which can interfere with their normal trafficking from the cytosol to mitochondria. Lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KARS), an enzyme required for protein translation that was shown to interact with mutant SOD1 in yeast, is a good candidate as a target for interaction with mutant SOD1 at the mitochondrion in mammals because of its dual cytosolic and mitochondrial localization. Here, we show that in mammalian cells mutant SOD1 interacts preferentially with the mitochondrial form of KARS (mitoKARS). KARS-SOD1 interactions occur also in the mitochondria of the nervous system in transgenic mice. In the presence of mutant SOD1, mitoKARS displays a high propensity to misfold and aggregate prior to its import into mitochondria, becoming a target for proteasome degradation.

Approximately 10% of ALS cases are inherited, of which 20% are associated with mutations in the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, SOD1. SOD1 is a free radical scavenging enzyme, but because many SOD1 mutations do not affect the enzymatic activity and the disease has an autosomal dominant transmission, a toxic gain of function of the mutant protein has been postulated. SOD1 is abundantly expressed in the cytosol, but a proportion of mutant SOD1 is also associated with mitochondria, where its aggregation could have pathological consequences (1Higgins C.M. Jung C.

The large majority of mitochondrial protein components are nuclear-encoded, synthesized in the cytosol, and imported into mitochondria through specialized import machineries. Thus, one hypothesis for mutant SOD1 toxicity involves aberrant interactions of mutant SOD1 with mitochondrial proteins (7Deng H.X. Shi Y. Furukawa Y. Zhai H. Fu R. Liu E. Gorrie G.H. Khan M.S.

In a yeast two-hybrid screen, lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KARS), an enzyme required for protein synthesis, was found to interact with mutant but not with wild type (WT) SOD1 (17Kunst C.B. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Patterson D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). KARS is a potential candidate for abnormal interactions with SOD1 affecting mitochondria, because it exists both as a cytosolic (cytoKARS) and as a mitochondrially imported (mitoKARS) enzyme. Here, we investigate the interactions between mutant hSOD1 and KARS in mammalian cells and their consequences on mitochondrial integrity and cell viability. We find that as a consequence of aberrant interactions with mutant hSOD1, mitoKARS misfolds prior to or during its import into mitochondria and becomes targeted for proteasomal degradation. Mutant hSOD1-mitoKARS interactions result in the formation of high molecular weight protein aggregates that correlate with impaired mtDNA-encoded protein synthesis, mitochondrial morphological abnormalities, and decreased cell survival. Expression Plasmids—Human mitoKARS cDNA was cloned in pEF/Myc/cyto (Invitrogen) as described previously (18Tolkunova E. Park H. Xia J. King M.P. Davidson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35063-35069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Human cytoKARS with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag and hSOD1 cDNAs (wild type and G93A and G85R mutants) were cloned into pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI) and pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen), respectively. Mitochondrial GFP (mitoGFP) was a gift of Dr. Rosario Rizzuto (19Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) (University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Proteasome Inhibition—COS-7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in advanced Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) and Gluta-max (Invitrogen), in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfections with plasmids encoding KARS and hSOD1, either individually or in combination, were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For proteasome inhibition experiments, the cells were treated for 16 h with 20 μm (complete inhibition) or 75 nm (partial inhibition) of MG132 (Sigma). hSOD1 Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice expressing WT (N1029) or G93A (20Gurney M.E.

All of the animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Cell Imaging by Immunocytochemistry—Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells grown on glass coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After three washes in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal goat serum. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h with gentle agitation. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and applied to cells for 1 h. The cells were washed in PBS three times after primary and secondary antibody incubations. All of the steps were performed at room temperature. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal hSOD1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal SOD1 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), FLAG-M2 (Sigma), monoclonal Myc (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY or Abcam, Cambridge, MA), polyclonal Myc (Sigma), Hsp70 (Stressgen), and MnSOD (Stressgen). Immunostained cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63× Plan Apochromat oil immersion lens with aperture 1.4 using a photomultiplier (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). A series of z sections were taken spanning the thickness of the cell with intervals between sections set at 0.5 μm. z stack images were projected onto a single plane using the LSM Image Browser software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.), and digital magnification was 2× (total magnification was 126×). Cell Viability Assay—COS cells grown in 48-well plates were transfected with hSOD1 (WT, G93A, G85R, or empty vector) with or without mitoKARS. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed once in PBS and incubated with 2.5 μm calcein AM (Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured at 485-nm excitation and 535-nm emission in an HTS 7000 plus plate reader (Packard Instrument Company, Downers Grove, IL) with background subtraction. Cell and Tissue Fractionation—COS cells transfected with hSOD1 and KARS were fractionated into cytosolic and enriched mitochondrial fractions according to established protocols (21Pallotti F. Lenaz G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse brain and spinal cord mitochondria were isolated and purified in a Ficoll gradient as described previously (6Vijayvergiya C. Beal M.F. Buck J. Manfredi G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The tissue homogenization buffer contained 20 mm Hepes instead of Tris-HCl to allow for chemical cross-linking. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Cells or tissue fractions were cross-linked with 2 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) dissolved in Me2SO for 30 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and incubation for 15 min to stop the reaction. For cells, the samples were washed three times in PBS, lysed in RIPA buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., S. San Francisco, CA), which had been preadsorbed with appropriate antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and collected by brief centrifugation. The following day, the beads were washed three times in RIPA buffer and boiled for 10 min in Laemmli buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol prior to electrophoresis. For mouse tissue, the samples were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Immunoprecipitation was performed as above, except that the buffer contained 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 320 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated samples were separated by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk (in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, followed by primary antibody incubation overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoreactive bands were revealed with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and detection of proteins: LysRS against human KARS (22Cen S. Javanbakht H. Kim S. Shiba K. Craven R. Rein A. Ewalt K. Schimmel P. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), polyclonal SOD1 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), ubiquitin (Chemicon Millipore, Billerica, MA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Abcam), Tim23 (BD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA), Myc, and FLAG-M2. Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—COS cells were transfected with mitoKARS with or without hSOD1 (WT, G93A, and G85R). The mitochondria were solubilized, and native protein complexes were separated by blue native gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as described previously (23D'Aurelio M. Gajewski C.D. Lenaz G. Manfredi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2157-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween for 8 h and immunoprobed with LysRS or complex III core II subunit (Invitrogen) antibodies. Filter Trap Assays—The filter trap assay was described previously (6Vijayvergiya C. Beal M.F. Buck J. Manfredi G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from COS cells or tissues were incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice. The samples were vacuum-filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate membranes (GE Osmonics, Trevose, PA) using a 96-well dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were washed and immunodetected with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as described above. In a set of experiments, proteinase K treatment was performed on mitochondrial fractions from COS cells co-transfected with mutant hSOD1 and mitoKARS prior to performing the filter trap assay. Twenty μg of the samples were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K on ice for 30 min. Proteinase K was inactivated with 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for 15 min. Mitochondrial Protein Synthesis Analysis—The rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis was measured by pulse-labeling experiments with [35S]methionine according to the method of Chomyn (24Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS cells were co-transfected with WT or G85R hSOD1 and mitoKARS. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (0.2 mCi of 1,175 Ci/mmol/plate) for 30 min in the presence of the cytoplasmic translation inhibitor emetine (50 μg/ml). The labeled cells were trypsinized, washed, and treated with 1% SDS. Samples containing 50 μg of protein were electrophoresed through a 15–20% exponential SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel. The gel was dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and selected radioactive bands corresponding to mtDNA-encoded peptides ND5, ND1, and A6 were analyzed with a Cyclone phosphorimaging device (Packard Instrument Company). Cell lysates were also subjected to Western blot to determine the expression levels of mitoKARS and hSOD1 using antibodies against Myc and SOD1, as well as loading controls for nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein, Tim23, and the cytosolic protein, GAPDH. KARS Expression and Subcellular Localization in COS Cells—Expression studies with the two isoforms of KARS were conducted using plasmid vectors coding for human mitoKARS or cytoKARS tagged at the C-termini with Myc and FLAG epitopes, respectively (Fig. 1A). Upon transient transfection in COS cells, mitoKARS is distributed to the mitochondria, as shown by co-localization of Myc immunostaining with the mitochondrial matrix protein MnSOD (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the cytoKARS protein lacking a mitochondrial targeting signal is expressed diffusely in the cell and co-localizes with the cytoplasmic chaperone protein, Hsp70 (Fig. 1C). Subcellular localization of KARS was further analyzed by immunoblot of cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. mitoKARS is detected as the 69-kDa unprocessed form (i.e. still containing the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal) in the cytosolic fraction and predominantly as the 64-kDa processed form in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 1D). As expected, cytoKARS is localized only in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1D). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Tim23 were used as the cytosolic and mitochondrial markers, respectively. cytoKARS is thought to form a dimer, which is part of a large protein complex containing multiple aminoacylating enzymes (25Mirande M. Le Corre D. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Robinson J.C. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but the functional structure of mitoKARS has not yet been defined. Thus, to assess whether also mitoKARS exists in multimeric complexes, we performed a blue native gel analysis, which detected a single band of ∼150 kDa, presumably corresponding to a mitoKARS dimer (Fig. 1E). mitoKARS Co-immunoprecipitates with SOD1—Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were carried out to investigate the interaction between hSOD1 and mitoKARS. Because KARS was shown to interact with mutant SOD1 in yeast (17Kunst C.B. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Patterson D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we tested two different mutants of hSOD1, G93A and G85R, and compared them with WT hSOD1. The two mutants differ by their structural and biochemical properties, because the G93A hSOD1 is folded into a stable and active protein, whereas the G85R hSOD1 is highly unstable and lacks detectable dismutase activity. mitoKARs is pulled down by the SOD1 antibody only in cells expressing mutant hSOD1. Reverse co-IP with the Myc antibody pulls down G93A and G85R mutant hSOD1 efficiently, whereas only a small amount of WT hSOD1 is detected (Fig. 2A, top left panels), despite the fact that similar amounts of the three forms of hSOD1 are expressed in cell lysates (Fig. 2A, bottom left panels). As expected, a negative control co-IP in the absence of antibodies failed to pull down KARS or SOD1 (Fig. 2A, top right panels). Under the same experimental conditions, expression of mutant or WT hSOD1 together with cytoKARS did not result in detectable co-IP of the two proteins (data not shown), suggesting that SOD1 interacts selectively with mitoKARS and not with cytoKARS. To assess whether SOD1-KARS interactions take place in vivo in a disease-relevant tissue with endogenous expression of KARS, we investigated mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from brain and spinal cord of WT and G93A hSOD1 transgenic mice. When SOD1 was pulled down, co-immunoprecipitated KARS was detected using the LysRS antibody, which recognizes both forms of KARS. This antibody was raised against human KARS (22Cen S. Javanbakht H. Kim S. Shiba K. Craven R. Rein A. Ewalt K. Schimmel P. Musier-Forsyth K. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but it reacts also with mouse KARS. Both WT and G93A SOD1 pulled down endogenous KARS more efficiently in the mitochondrial fractions as compared with the cytosolic ones, both in brain and spinal cord (Fig. 2B). Relative to the amount of immunoprecipitated SOD1, KARS is pulled down more efficiently in G93A than in WT spinal cord mitochondria, suggesting that KARS may interact more strongly with mutant than WT hSOD1. SOD1 Induces the Formation of Aggregates Containing mitoKARS—Mutant SOD1 forms aggregates in the cytosol and mitochondria (6Vijayvergiya C. Beal M.F. Buck J. Manfredi G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2463-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27Wang J. Xu G. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that aberrant protein-protein interaction with mutant SOD1 would lead to recruitment of KARS into aggregates. COS cells were co-transfected with WT or mutant hSOD1 and either cyto or mitoKARS and cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were subjected to size exclusion filter trap assays. Using the LysRS antibody, we find that cells expressing mitoKARS contain unfilterable aggregates in the mitochondrial fraction. On the other hand, in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of cells transfected with cytoKARS, unfilterable aggregates are virtually undetectable (Fig. 2C). This is not due to lower expression of cytoKARS than mitoKARS, as shown by Western blot of the lysates (Fig. 2D). We note that the expression of mitoKARS alone results in aggregation (Fig. 2C), but co-expression with hSOD1 clearly increases mitoKARS aggregation. In the same mitoKARS and SOD1 transfected cell samples, we also confirm the presence of mitoKARS aggregates associated with mitochondria using the Myc antibody and show that mutant hSOD1 increases KARS aggregation more than WT hSOD1 (Fig. 2E). Filter trap assays of cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from brain and spinal cord of transgenic mice show unfilterable protein aggregates containing KARS, which are more abundant in the mitochondrial fraction of G93A mice (Fig. 2F, top panel). These aggregates correlate with the presence of unfilterable SOD1 aggregates (Fig. 2F, bottom panel), indicating that also in vivo KARS aggregates are preferentially associated with mitochondria containing mutant hSOD1. mitoKARs Aggregates Are Associated with the Outer Surface of Mitochondria—The presence of mitoKARS aggregates in the cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 2, C and E) suggests that a portion of the protein aggregates prior to being imported. To determine the site of formation of the mitoKARS aggregates, we treated intact mitochondria with proteinase K prior to the filter trap assay. The majority of mitoKARS aggregates are digested by proteinase K, whereas MnSOD, a protein of the mitochondrial matrix, is protected from digestion (Fig. 3A), suggesting that aggregation of mitoKARS occurs mostly on the external surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane. To test whether mutant hSOD1 interferes with mitoKARS import, we correlated the amount of mitoKARS associated with mitochondria with that of total cellular mitoKARS. Mitochondrial mitoKARS was normalized by the content of Tim23, a marker of the inner membrane. Total cellular mitoKARS was normalized by the content of the cytosolic protein GAPDH. We find less mitoKARS associated with mitochondria in mutant hSOD1 cells, as compared with cells expressing WT hSOD1 (Fig. 3, B and C). To determine whether reduced mitoKARS import affects normal mitochondrial protein synthesis, we performed a [35S]methionine pulse labeling of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesized proteins in cells expressing KARS and WT or G85R hSOD1. We find a generalized decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells expressing G85R hSOD1 (Fig. 3D). Quantification by phosphorimaging of selected labeled mitochondrial peptides revealed approximately a 25% reduction in the translation of ND1, ND5, and A6 (data not shown). The same samples were also analyzed by Western blot to detect GAPDH and Tim23 as protein loading controls and hSOD1 and mitoKARS to confirm transgene expression (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that mutant hSOD1 interaction affects mitochondrial function through an impairment of protein synthesis. Blue native gel electrophoresis to detect assembled mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes detected a defect in complex III, which paralleled a reduction in the content of dimeric mitoKARS in cells expressing G85R mutant hSOD1 (Fig. 3F). The reduction in complex III is likely the result of decreased synthesis of cytochrome b, which is mtDNA-encoded. We looked at the nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins VDAC, Tim 23, and Hsp60 by Western blot in the samples used for blue native gels to control for protein loading (Fig. 3G). Nonimported mitoKARS Is Degraded through the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System—The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has been linked to ALS pathogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 28Kabashi E. Durham H.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 1038-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among many other functions, UPS is involved in regulating mitochondrial protein import (29Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31829-31836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and mutations in components of the UPS can affect mitochondrial morphology in yeast (30Fisk H.A.

J. 2004; 381: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, proteins involved in tRNA import, including the precursor of mitoKARS (pre-MSK1p), interact with components of the UPS, and proteasome inhibition decreases mitochondrial tRNA import (32Brandina I.

Because mitoKARS appears to be poorly imported and aggregates in the presence of mutant SOD1, we tested whether the UPS is involved in degrading nonimported mitoKARS. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increases the unprocessed, nonimported, form of mitoKARS in cells co-expressing hSOD1 and mitoKARS (Fig. 4A, left panels), whereas cytoKARS content is unchanged (Fig. 4A, right panels). Because there is no evidence that mitochondria contain a prote"

We systematically examined the relationship between gene expression, glycosyltransferase activity, glycan expression, and selectin-binding function in different systems, including human neutrophils, undifferentiated HL-60 (human promyelocytic cells), differentiated HL-60, and HL-60 synchronized in specific growth phases. Results demonstrate that 1) the sLe(X) (sialyl-Lewis-X) epitope is expressed in P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) from neutrophils at higher levels compared with HL-60. This variation may be due to differences in the relative activities of alpha1,3-fucosyltransferases and alpha2,3-sialyltransferases in these two cell types. 2) HL-60 cell differentiation along granulocyte lineage increased the activity of beta1,4GalT and beta1,3GlcNAcT by 1.6- to 3.2-fold. This may contribute to LacNAc chain extension as evidenced by the 1.7-fold increase in DSA-lectin (lectin recognizing LacNAc) binding to cells after differentiation. 3) The activity of enzymes contributing to sLe(X) formation in leukocytes likely varies as ST3[Galbeta1,4GlcNAc] < or = alpha1,3FT[sialyl-LacNAc] < beta1,3GlcNAcT. 4) O-glycan specific glycosyltransferase activity does not undergo periodic variation with cell cycle phases. Overall, gene expression and enzyme activity data combined with knowledge of biochemistry can predict the resulting glycan structures and yield viable experimentally testable hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970199164,"Scaffolds for osteochondral tissue engineering should provide mechanical stability, while offering specific signals for chondral and bone regeneration with a completely interconnected porous network for cell migration, attachment, and proliferation. Composites of polymers and ceramics are often considered to satisfy these requirements. As such methods largely rely on interfacial bonding between the ceramic and polymer phase, they may often compromise the use of the interface as an instrument to direct cell fate. Alternatively, here, we have designed hybrid 3D scaffolds using a novel concept based on biomaterial assembly, thereby omitting the drawbacks of interfacial bonding. Rapid prototyped ceramic particles were integrated into the pores of polymeric 3D fiber-deposited (3DF) matrices and infused with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) to obtain constructs that display the mechanical robustness of ceramics and the flexibility of polymers, mimicking bone tissue properties. Ostechondral scaffolds were then fabricated by directly depositing a 3DF structure optimized for cartilage regeneration adjacent to the bone scaffold. Stem cell seeded scaffolds regenerated both cartilage and bone in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2000608548,"The enormous macromolecular phycobilisome antenna complex (>4 MDa) in cyanobacteria and red algae undergoes controlled degradation during certain forms of nutrient starvation. The NblA protein (approximately 6 kDa) has been identified as an essential component in this process. We have used structural, biochemical, and genetic methods to obtain molecular details on the mode of action of the NblA protein. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the NblA protein from both the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus and the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus sp. PCC 7942. The NblA monomer has a helix-loop-helix motif which dimerizes into an open, four-helical bundle, identical to the previously determined NblA structure from Anabaena. Previous studies indicated that mutations to NblA residues near the C terminus impaired its binding to phycobilisome proteins in vitro, whereas the only mutation known to affect NblA function in vivo is located near the protein N terminus. We performed random mutagenesis of the S. elongatus nblA gene which enabled the identification of four additional amino acids crucial for NblA function in vivo. This data shows that essential amino acids are not confined to the protein termini. We also show that expression of the Anabaena nblA gene complements phycobilisome degradation in an S. elongatus NblA-null mutant despite the low homology between NblAs of these cyanobacteria. We propose that the NblA interacts with the phycobilisome via ""structural mimicry"" due to similarity in structural motifs found in all phycobiliproteins. This suggestion leads to a new model for the mode of NblA action which involves the entire NblA protein."

Despite the key role played by the quinonoid intermediates in the catalysis by PLP-dependent enzymes, limited accurate information is available about their structures. We trapped the quinonoid intermediates of Citrobacter freundii tyrosine phenol-lyase with L-alanine and L-methionine in the crystalline state and determined their structures at 1.9- and 1.95-A resolution, respectively, by cryo-crystallography. The data reveal a network of protein-PLP-substrate interactions that stabilize the planar geometry of the quinonoid intermediate. In both structures the protein subunits are found in two conformations, open and closed, uncovering the mechanism by which binding of the substrate and restructuring of the active site during its closure protect the quinonoid intermediate from the solvent and bring catalytically important residues into positions suitable for the abstraction of phenol during the beta-elimination of L-tyrosine. In addition, the structural data indicate a mechanism for alanine racemization involving two bases, Lys-257 and a water molecule. These two bases are connected by a hydrogen bonding system allowing internal transfer of the Calpha proton."

Based on crystallographic and biochemical studies of prokaryotic NBFs, a common mechanism of ABC transporter function has been proposed: ATP binding to the NBF domains induces formation of a NBF dimer, such that the two ATP binding sites are sandwiched between the two NBFs. ATP hydrolysis by the NBF dimer induces a conformational change that is transduced to the TMDs, fueling the function of the ABC transporter (18Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J.

In SUR, mutation of catalytic Walker A and Walker B residues (which are required for in vitro ATPase activity of prokaryotic NBFs) leads to decreased MgADP stimulation of KATP channels (10Shyng S.

Azido-ATP labeling studies of SUR1 indicate that the binding site formed by NBF1 Walker A and Walker B does not significantly hydrolyze ATP, while the binding site formed by NBF2 Walker A and B does (24Ueda K.

Consistent with this, isolated NBF2 from SUR1 exhibits higher in vitro ATPase activity than NBF1 (27Masia R. Enkvetchakul D. Nichols C.G. J. Mol. Cell.

Thus, the activated NBF configuration in SUR1 might correspond to a NBF dimer with ATP bound at one ABS and MgADP bound at the other. In the absence of a high-resolution crystal structure, various approaches have been employed to assess NBF organization in SUR. Azido-ATP labeling experiments show that either MgATP or MgADP binding to NBF2 stabilizes ATP binding to NBF1 (29Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

Finally, a low-resolution crystal structure of the entire KATP channel complex depicts two regions in the electron density map that may correspond to the SUR NBFs in close apposition; surprisingly, they are not located directly underneath the respective TMDs, but rather at a significant offset, suggesting a severe twisting of the TMD-NBF linkers or the thus far unexplored possibility of intersubunit NBF dimers (32Mikhailov M.V. Campbell J.D. de Wet H. Shimomura K. Zadek B. Collins R.F. Sansom M.S. Ford R.C. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4166-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study we have addressed the possibility of SUR NBF heterodimerization by homology modeling of SUR1 NBFs and cysteine mutagenesis of the predicted dimer interface. We have assessed the functional consequences of mutation by measuring MgADP stimulation of recombinant KATP channels, as well as macroscopic fluxes in intact cells. Mutagenesis of predicted dimer interface residues has profound functional effects, especially at the center of the dimer, where hyperstimulating mutations are clustered in the D-loop region.

Physiol. 1989; 419: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A float connected to a tension transducer controls the solution level by varying the outflow from the end-pool. COS cells (2-5 days post-transfection) that fluoresced green under UV illumination were selected for patch-clamping. Membranes were voltage-clamped with a CV-4 headstage and an Axopatch 1-D amplifier, and currents were digitized with a Digidata 1322A board (all from Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Bath and pipette control solutions (KINT) contained, in mm: 150 KCl, 10 HEPES, and 1 EGTA (pH 7.4). ATP and ADP were added to the bathing solution as dipotassium salts. Where indicated, MgCl2 was added to the bathing solution to a calculated [Mg2+free] of 0.5 mm. Diazoxide (0.3 mm) was dissolved in KINT plus 0.1 mm MgATP from a stock solution in DMSO. Data were analyzed off-line with the pClamp 8.2 software suite (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Results are presented as mean ± S.E.. Statistical tests and p values are noted in the figure legends. Macroscopic 86Rb+ Efflux Assays—COS cells in 12-well plates were incubated for 24 h in culture medium containing 86RbCl (1 μCi/ml), 1-2 days after transfection. Before measurement of 86Rb+ efflux, cells were washed twice with Ringer's solution (in mm: 118 NaCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 4.7 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 MgSO4, 10 HEPES; pH 7.4) plus Metabolic Inhibition (1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 2.5 μg/ml oligomycin). At selected time points, the solution was aspirated from the cells and replaced with fresh solution; after completion of the assay, cells were lysed with 1% SDS, aspirated, and assayed in a scintillation counter. Raw data are shown as 86Rb+ efflux relative to total counts (including all time points and lysate). The rate constant for KATP-specific 86Rb+ efflux (k2) was obtained by fitting the data with the single-exponential Equation 1, Relative flux = 1 − exp[−(k1 + k2) × t](Eq. 1) where the apparent rate constant for nonspecific efflux (k1) was obtained from untransfected cells, for which k2 was assumed to be 0. Homology Modeling of SUR1 NBFs as a Heterodimer—Using the crystal structure of the bacterial NBF MJ0796 as a template (18Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), we generated a homology model of NBF1 and NBF2 from SUR1 as an ATP-bound dimer (Fig. 1A). The Mg2+ ion site is occupied by Na+, as the MJ0796 crystal structure was obtained bound to NaATP rather than MgATP. A key feature of the model is that the nucleotide binding sites are located at the dimer interface, such that each nucleotide is interacting with residues from both NBFs. This feature is in agreement with similar NBF homology models of SUR1 (41Campbell J.D. Proks P. Lippiat J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S123-S127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and SUR2B (43Shi Y. Chen X. Wu Z. Shi W. Yang Y. Cui N. Jiang C. Harrison R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7523-7530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For clarity, we have defined each ATP-binding site (ABS) as follows: ABS1 is formed by Walker A, Walker B, Q-loop, and H-loop from NBF1, and the Signature Sequence from NBF2, while ABS2 is formed by Walker A, Walker B, Q-loop, and H-loop from NBF2, and the Signature Sequence from NBF1 (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition to providing a detailed prediction of protein-nucleotide interactions, the model predicts residues outside the binding sites that are also expected to be located in the dimer interface, notably residues in the D- and H-loops (Fig. 1). The model was used to exhaustively select 31 candidate residues located in the putative dimer interface for mutagenesis, to assess the functional consequences of dimer interface perturbation. Effects of Predicted Dimer Interface Mutations on MgADP Stimulation—Each of the predicted interface residues was mutated individually to cysteine. Of the 31 mutants, two (F1482C and S1483C) failed to express measurable KATP channel current in excised inside-out patches from COS cells when cotransfected with Kir6.2. The remaining twenty-nine mutants expressed functional KATP channels, and we assessed SUR functionality in each of them by measuring their sensitivity to MgADP stimulation (Fig. 2A). Mutants were assigned to one of three groups, depending on whether they exhibited unchanged stimulation compared with WT SUR1 (ten mutants), significantly decreased stimulation (sixteen mutants), or significantly increased stimulation (three mutants, Fig. 2B). Although there are differences in the magnitude of these effects, this simplified scheme facilitates discussion by focusing on patterns of functional alteration. There is the possibility that the effects of the cysteine mutations are due to formation of a disulfide bond with native cysteines. However, DTT applied to excised patches had no effect on the MgADP stimulation of several representative mutants (data not shown), suggesting that either their effects are not due to disulfide bond formation, or, if a disulfide bond is indeed formed, it is not accessible to DTT. Additional attempts to detect disulfide bonds using oxidizing and cross-linking reagents in both excised patches and intact cells were unsuccessful, suggesting that either no disulfide bonds are formed by the introduced cysteines, or any disulfide bonds formed in the dimer interface are inaccessible to the employed reagents. Effects of Predicted Dimer Interface Mutations on Diazoxide Stimulation—Stimulation of KATP channels by both MgADP and potassium channel openers (KCOs) is hypothesized to occur through convergent pathways (i.e. by energetically favoring the same “activated” configuration of SUR1). For a few representative mutations, we tested the ability of a KCO (diazoxide) to stimulate KATP channels (Fig. 2C). Consistent with expectations, two mutations that increased MgADP stimulation (A1510C and S1511C) also increased diazoxide stimulation; a mutation that decreased MgADP stimulation (D1513C) also decreased diazoxide stimulation; and a mutation that had no effect on MgADP stimulation (S1356C) had no effect on diazoxide stimulation (Fig. 2C). Effects of Predicted Dimer Interface Mutations on Macroscopic 86Rb+ Fluxes—To test the effects of dimer interface mutations on KATP channel activity in the physiologically relevant intact cell rather than in excised patches, we measured macroscopic 86Rb+ fluxes from transfected COS cells, under conditions of metabolic inhibition, for WT and 25 mutants (Fig. 3A). Flux data were fitted with Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to determine the rate constant of KATP-specific efflux, k2 (Fig. 3B). Two previously reported SUR1 NBF mutations were also included in the data set: F1388L, which results in increased MgADP stimulation (44Cartier E.A. Shen S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7081-7090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and D1506A, which abolishes MgADP stimulation (10Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because they represent two ends of the SUR1 functional spectrum, we have included them here as reference points. To compare these data with MgADP stimulation data, normalized k2 values were plotted versus normalized MgADP stimulation (Fig. 3C). Overall, there is a good correlation between the two parameters: on-cell activity increases with increasing stimulation until it reaches a plateau near WT-like stimulation. This general trend does not hold for all mutants, however, as two mutants that exhibit decreased stimulation (V862C and T1381C) actually exhibit increased on-cell activity. MgADP Stimulation of Double Mutant (S858C+R1539C)—To examine the possibility of inter-NBF interactions more directly, we combined two single cysteine mutations, one in each NBF (S858C in NBF1 D-loop and R1539C in NBF2 H-loop). These two residues are predicted by the model to be located in close proximity to each other in the center of the dimer interface, with a Cα-Cα distance of 9.3 Å (Fig. 4C). Given that R1539C essentially abolishes MgADP stimulation, one might expect stimulation to be absent in the double mutant. However, the (S858C+R1539C) double mutant actually exhibits stimulation comparable to WT (Fig. 4, A and B). Non-additivity of mutational effects may reflect interaction, across the dimer interface, of these two closely positioned residues. Conceivably, this could result from disulfide bond formation between the introduced cysteines; however, again, DTT was without effect when applied to excised patches (data not shown), suggesting that, either the effects are not due to disulfide bond formation or, if a disulfide bond is indeed formed, it is not accessible to DTT. Perturbation of the Predicted Dimer Interface Alters KATP Channel Function—Multiple mutations in the predicted dimer interface result in significant alterations of SUR1-dependent regulation of KATP channel function. These effects are variable, both qualitatively (impairment or enhancement) and quantitatively (different degrees of impairment or enhancement). On average, NBF1 is more tolerant of mutagenesis than NBF2 (56 versus 21% of mutations have no effect); additionally, out of the mutations that do have a significant effect, those in NBF2 tend to be more severe than the equivalent mutations in NBF1 (Fig. 2B). However, it is more revealing to consider the effects of these mutations in the context of the putative NBF heterodimer. When each mutation is mapped onto the homology model and color-coded according to its effect on MgADP stimulation, quite striking structure-function patterns emerge (Figs. 5 and 6).FIGURE 6Functional clustering of dimer interface mutations in the SUR1 NBF dimer model. Mutated residues mapped on the SUR1 NBF heterodimer model. Native side chains are shown as space-filled spheres, colored as in Fig. 5 on the basis of the functional effects of their mutation to cysteine. The model is shown from above (top left) and below (top right), and in two side views (bottom left, right). ATP-binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2) are indicated, and ATP molecules are shown as sticks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The three hyperstimulating mutations (S858C, A1510C, and S1511C) are all in close proximity to one another at the center of the predicted dimer interface (Fig. 6, green), such that they are surrounded by protein and not exposed to solution. These residues are part of a highly conserved motif, the D-loop, consisting of a conserved aspartate and a less conserved group of three preceding nonpolar or uncharged polar residues (SALD in NBF1, ASID in NBF2). Despite the conservation of this D-loop in all ABC proteins, a consistent functional role has not been ascribed to it, in contrast to other conserved elements. There is relatively high tolerance for mutation of residues predicted to be located toward the top of the dimer (i.e. near the membrane), whether in the vicinity of ABS1 or ABS2 (Fig. 6, yellow). By contrast, multiple residues located toward the bottom of the dimer (i.e. away from the membrane) are highly sensitive to perturbation mutagenesis (Fig. 6, red). These results may indicate that the top of the dimer is stabilized by interactions with nucleotides (because the binding sites are located near the membrane) or with the TMDs; in SUR2B, interactions between NBF2 and the intracellular loops of TMD1 are hypothesized to underlie channel activation by PKA (43Shi Y. Chen X. Wu Z. Shi W. Yang Y. Cui N. Jiang C. Harrison R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7523-7530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The two mutations that result in no channel activity (F1482C and S1483C) are both located in the NBF2 signature sequence, and are thus predicted to be located in ABS1. A possible explanation for this result is that correct folding of ABS1 (but not ABS2) is required for normal SUR1 trafficking to the membrane, since one equivalent NBF1 mutation, predicted to lie in ABS2 (S831C), expresses normal activity. However, previous mutagenesis studies of SUR1 have shown that the structural determinants required for SUR1 trafficking and expression are different from those required for activity of the channel complex (44Cartier E.A. Shen S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7081-7090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Effects of mutations on one parameter may therefore be unrelated to its effects on the other. Thus, the deleterious effects of these two mutations on channel expression may not necessarily be mediated via disruption of the NBF heterodimer structure. The abolition of MgADP activation by mutation of the H-loop histidines (His-889 and His-1538) may be explained by their involvement in coordination of Mg2+ and stabilization of the attacking water molecule during ATP hydrolysis. Consistent with this idea, H-loop mutations severely impair ATP hydrolysis in some prokaryotic NBFs (45Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In SUR, biochemical studies indicate that ABS1 (unlike ABS2) does not significantly hydrolyze ATP (24Ueda K. Inagaki N.

https://openalex.org/W2030884423,"The cell surface-expressed γ chain of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI) can be phosphorylated on two tyrosine residues of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), leading to recruitment and activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a kinase that is essential for mast cell signaling and allergic responses. However, it is not known whether preferential phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the two individual FcRγ tyrosines (the N-terminal Tyr47 and C-terminal Tyr58) could regulate Syk activation. Herein we report that phosphorylation of only Tyr58 was able to elicit Syk phosphorylation and a weak rise in intracellular calcium, suggesting that Tyr58 phosphorylation may be distinctively important for Syk activation. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that both Tyr47 and Tyr58 could be similarly phosphorylated. However, mass spectrometric analysis of the phosphorylated FcϵRγ from bone marrow-derived mast cells showed that phosphorylation at Tyr47 was at least 2-fold greater than at Tyr58. This suggested that, once phosphorylated, Tyr58 is preferentially dephosphorylated. In vitro studies demonstrated more efficient dephosphorylation of Tyr58 (by the receptor-associated phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2) than of Tyr47. Analysis of Syk binding to wild type and mutant phosphorylated FcϵRI revealed that mutation at Tyr58 almost completely ablated Syk binding, whereas mutation at Tyr47 moderately reduced Syk binding. The findings argue for a novel regulatory mechanism, where dephosphorylation of phospho-Tyr58 is likely to promote the down-regulation of Syk activation and suppression of mast cell responses.

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are key events in the initiation and regulation of cell signaling and responses.

The phosphorylated receptor is then able to recruit and bind other signaling proteins through their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which recognize phosphotyrosines. Among the proteins demonstrated to interact with the phosphorylated FcϵRI is the protein tyrosine kinase Syk (3Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Syk binding promotes its activation, and it subsequently phosphorylates multiple signaling molecules, thus amplifying the signaling that is essential for cellular responses (5Siraganian R.P. Zhang J.

This fast forward response must be effectively controlled to avoid the detrimental effects of a prolonged inflammatory response. Protein tyrosine phosphatases are key regulators of cell activation. SHP-1 and -2 (Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases 1 and 2) are expressed in hematopoietic cells or are ubiquitously expressed, respectively. These phosphatases have been described to interact with numerous signaling proteins (such as Vav1, Grb2, Sos, SLP-76, Lyn, and SIRPα1) as well as with many inhibitory receptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, where they impart the inhibitory activity of these receptors (reviewed in Refs. 7Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar and 8Bruhns P. Fremont S. Daeron M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SHP-1 was detected in immunoprecipitates of FcϵRI prior to stimulation, whereas SHP-2 was observed only after FcϵRI stimulation (9Swieter M. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5330-5336PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kimura T. Zhang J. Sagawa K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4426-4434PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of SHP-1 caused decreased phosphorylation of FcϵRIβ and γ subunits in RBL cells, and similar effects were noted on the phosphorylation of Syk. However, whether SHP-1 or SHP-2 equally dephosphorylate both ITAM tyrosines or whether there is preferential dephosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines is not known. This is an important query, given that the ITAM motifs of both β and γ subunits were shown to potentially interact with multiple signaling proteins (3Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kimura T. Kihara H. Bhattacharyya S. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

Thus, preferential dephosphorylation at one tyrosine residue might cause the loss of interaction with one protein but still allow the subsequent binding of another to the second phosphorylated tyrosine residue. In addition, selective phosphorylation/dephosphorylation might serve to control the binding and activation of Syk kinase. In vitro experiments have shown that both Tyr(P)47 and Tyr(P)58 (herein we use the amino acid designation of the surface-expressed protein, without leader peptide) of FcRγ was required for high affinity Syk binding; however, Tyr(P)58 appeared to have a modestly higher affinity for Syk than Tyr(P)47 (11Kimura T.

In the current study, we explored whether the FcRγ ITAM tyrosines are preferentially phosphorylated and/or preferentially dephosphorylated. This was based on the observation of multiple phosphorylated species of FcRγ following FcϵRI stimulation. We reasoned that these multiple species might represent forms of FcRγ with differing potential in binding Syk. Prior studies already demonstrated that the FcϵRIβ ITAM tyrosines differentially bind Lyn (12Furumoto Y. Nunomura S. Terada T. Rivera J. Ra C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49177-49187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14On M. Billingsley J.M. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45782-45790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but to date no studies address whether differential phosphorylation/dephosphorylation might regulate such binding. Herein, we took the approach of expressing the wild type and individual tyrosine mutants of FcRγ in BMMC derived from FcRγ-deficient mice. Our findings demonstrate that weak phosphorylation of Tyr58 alone can cause a modest phosphorylation of Syk and weak calcium signals. However, Tyr47 and Tyr58 are not differentially phosphorylated when phosphatase activity is inhibited in vivo or when phosphorylated by Lyn kinase in vitro. In contrast, dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)58 by SHP-1 or SHP-2 was more efficient than that of Tyr(P)47. Mass spectrometry revealed that Tyr(P)47 was more abundant than Tyr(P)58 in FcϵRI-stimulated wild type cells. Collectively, the data argue that Tyr(P)58 is more important for Syk interaction, phosphorylation, and calcium responses, but this site is more susceptible to dephosphorylation than Tyr(P)47. Thus, the findings suggest a rapid dephosphorylation of FcRγ Tyr58 as a mechanism for controlling the extent of Syk activation. Antibodies—The cytokinergic (15Kitaura J. Song J. Tsai M. Asai K.

Site-specific Mutagenesis and Retroviral Constructs—The cDNA encoding mouse wild type FcRγ (YY) and the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant at Tyr47 (FY), at Tyr58 (YF), and both at Tyr47 and Tyr58 (FF) were cloned using the pLenti6/V5 Directional TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen).

The cells were also mock-transfected with an empty pMX-puro vector as a negative control. The viral supernatants were 10× concentrated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 4 h. Bone marrow cells from femurs of FcRγ-/- mice were grown in the presence of IL-3 and SCF for 10 days. For infection, the cells were resuspended in the concentrated viral supernatants containing 10 μg/ml Polybrene, spin-infected at 1200 × g for 45 min, and further incubated for 18 h. Infected cells were washed and allowed to grow in IL-3- and SCF-containing medium for 24 h before selection of transduced cells with 2 μg/ml puromycin.

Flow Cytometric Analysis for FcϵRI Expression—BMMCs (106/ml) were sensitized with 0.5 μg/ml anti-DNP IgE for 18 h at 37 °C. The sensitized BMMCs were preincubated with 5 μg/ml anti-mouse CD16/CD32 mAb mix for 5 min at 4 °C to prevent Ab binding to FcγRII/III and then stained with 10 μg/ml FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgE or the isotype control FITC-conjugated rat IgG1 for 30 min at 4 °C. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Calcium Imaging—To measure changes in the intracellular calcium concentration, two Ca2+ indicator dyes, Fluo-4/Fura Red/AM (Molecular Probes), were used. BMMCs were loaded with Fluo-4/AM (2 μm) and Fura Red/AM (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed three times with Hepes-Tyrode buffer. A Zeiss LSM-510 META confocal microscope with a 488-nm wavelength light from an argon laser was used for ratio-metric measurements. The fluorescence of Fluo-4 and Fura Red was detected through a band pass filter (505-530 nm) and a long pass filter (>560 nm), respectively. Fluorescence images were collected every 5 s, and the intensity of fluorescence was quantified using Zeiss LSM-510 META software. Ag Stimulation, Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—IgE-sensitized BMMCs were washed and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at 2 × 107/ml. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were stimulated with 200 ng/ml Ag (DNP-HSA) for 2 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were stimulated with pervanadate (prepared freshly by incubating 100 mm vanadate with 100 mm H2O2) for 15 min at room temperature, as indicated. Cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A for 30 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of Lyn, 0.05% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate were further added to the buffer (lysis buffer SDC). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of IgE-bound FcϵRI, postnuclear supernatants were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgE (10 μl/ml lysate) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (30 μl/ml lysate; GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer SDC and boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. The recovered proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 2× diluted Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE) for 30 min at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with optimal concentrations of various primary Ab, washed three times with the blocking buffer, and incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to infrared fluorescence dye IR800 or Alexa Fluor 680 for 30 min. After a further wash with the blocking buffer, the immunoblots were analyzed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). Some membranes were blotted with 10 nm GST fusion proteins (far Western) for 18 h at 4 °C followed by rabbit anti-GST antibody. For some experiments, membranes were stripped of bound antibodies by incubating with 0.2 n NaOH for 30 min and subsequently reprobed with other antibodies. Degranulation and Cytokine Measurements—Degranulation was determined by measuring the enzymatic activity of the granule marker, β-hexosaminidase, as previously described (19Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cytokine secretion (IL-6, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor, and MCP-1) was measured from culture supernatants prior to and after 4-h stimulation with Ag using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates from 107 unstimulated BMMCs were washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4) and resuspended in 90 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 mm GST fusion proteins as exogenous substrates. Kinase reaction conditions were previously established to be linear (20Yamashita T. Mao S.Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of ATP (final concentration of 1 mm). After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and 10 μl of kinase reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10. In Vitro PTPase Assay—The activities of recombinant human SHP-1 (Biomol International LP, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and SHP-2 (Upstate Biotechnology) were assayed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate at 37 °C in PTPase assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithio-threitol, and 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The assay conditions were linear using an amount of each enzyme whose activity corresponded to ∼200 pmol/min p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis (1 arbitrary unit) or 0.2 arbitrary units incubated with 100 nm tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-FcRγ in a total volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 60 min. The PTPase reaction products were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10. Large Scale Purification of FcRγ—IgE-sensitized BMMCs (4 × 107/ml) were unstimulated or stimulated with 400 ng/ml DNP-HSA for 2 min at 37 °C and then solubilized similarly as for the immunoprecipitation of FcϵRI. Postnuclear supernatants from 1 × 109 cells were precleared by passing through a 0.5-ml Protein A-Sepharose column, and IgE-bound FcϵRI was purified by affinity chromatography using 0.5 ml of Protein A-Sepharose beads that were covalently bound to a rabbit anti-mouse IgG, F(ab′)2 fragment-specific, using dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce). After washing the beads with lysis buffer, the bound material was eluted with lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS. FcRγ in the eluates from 4-6 × 109 cells was then further purified using 0.5 ml of rabbit anti-FcRγ-bound Sepharose beads. After washing the beads with lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100), the bound material was eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5. The eluate was neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, concentrated with cold acetone, and solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The resulting material was separated by SDS-PAGE using 16% Tris-glycine gels. Proteins were stained with the Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen), and two major bands were identified for mass spectrometry. LC/MS/MS Analysis of the FcRγ—In order to map which sites on the FcRγ are phosphorylated following FcϵRI stimulation, protein bands from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels were digested with trypsin to produce peptides that could be analyzed by LC/MS/MS. LC/MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides generated from the FcRγ bands identified peptides spanning the carboxyl-terminal region from residue 41 to 68 of the mature processed FcRγ subunit, as seen in Table 1.TABLE 1Phosphopeptides identified by MS/MS analysis of FcRγ tryptic peptides from activated cellsResiduesm/zChargeMr (experimental)Mr (calculated)Mass errorSequenceaR.E, R.S, K.A, or K.H indicate peptide bond cleavage.DaBand 1 41-53759.31+21516.611516.69−0.08R.EKADAVYTGLNTR.S(Tyr(P)47) 41-53506.59+31516.741516.690.05R.EKADAVYTGLNTR.S(Tyr(P)47) 43-53630.89+21259.761259.550.21K.ADAVYTGLNTR.S(Tyr(P)47) 54-62589.88+21177.741177.490.25R.SQETYETLK.H(Tyr(P)58)Band 2 41-53759.53+21517.041516.690.35R.EKADAVYTGLNTR.S(Tyr(P)47) 41-53506.75+31517.221516.690.53R.EKADAVYTGLNTR.S(Tyr(P)47) 43-53630.91+21259.811259.550.26K.ADAVYTGLNTR.S(Tyr(P)47) 54-62589.81+21177.611177.490.12R.SQETYETLK.H(Tyr(P)58)a R.E, R.S, K.A, or K.H indicate peptide bond cleavage. Open table in a new tab Engagement of FcϵRI Induces Multiple Species of Tyrosine-phosphorylated FcRγ with Differing Potential for Syk Binding—FcϵRI stimulation of mast cells was demonstrated to elicit multiple species (as defined by differing molecular mass) of FcRγ (21Paolini R. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This was attributed to changes both in the phosphorylation state of the FcRγ and FcϵRI-induced ubiquitination. We further explored this observation by analyzing the species of FcRγ detected after FcϵRI stimulation using reducing and nonreducing conditions, thus identifying the homodimers of FcRγ. Fig. 1A shows that brief stimulation of FcϵRI (2 min) allows resolution of at least three phosphorylated species of FcRγ ranging from 7 to 16 kDa in molecular mass. The major phosphorylated species showed a molecular mass of ∼9 kDa. Total protein blots also revealed three bands (at 250 ng/ml Ag), two apparently coinciding with the 7- and 9-kDa species observed in the phosphotyrosine blots. The major species, however, was ∼7 kDa and coincided with the molecular mass of the unmodified translated FcRγ. Under nonreducing conditions, a minimum of six species can be observed when probed with anti-FcRγ (Fig. 1B, right). Phosphotyrosine blotting revealed that at least four of these six species are thus modified, with the highest phosphorylation level detected in a ∼26-kDa form. In both reducing and nonreducing conditions, the FcϵRIβ and its phosphorylation were unaltered. Because nonreducing conditions resolved the largest number of phosphorylated FcRγ species and might reflect multiple species capable of binding Syk, we used these conditions in far Western analysis of Syk-SH2 domain binding to phosphorylated FcRγ. Fig. 1C demonstrates that the ∼26-kDa species (labeled a) had the highest affinity for interacting with Syk. Minor reactivity was observed in the next most well phosphorylated ∼24-kDa species (labeled as b in Fig. 1, B and C). The two dominant protein bands of about 18 and 20 kDa (Fig. 1B, right) in molecular mass were not phosphorylated (Fig. 1B, left) or found to bind the SH2 domains of Syk (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation and Functional Responses of Wild Type and ITAM Tyrosine-mutated FcRγ—To further explore the regulation of phosphorylation of FcRγ in situ, we generated (Fig. 2A) four retroviral constructs encoding the wild type FcRγ (YY), a Y47F mutant (FY), a Y58F mutant (YF), and a Y47F/Y58F double mutant (FF). These constructs were expressed in BMMC derived from FcRγ-deficient mice. As compared with normal BMMCs (γ+/+), FcRγ-deficient (γ-/-) BMMCs showed no expression of FcϵRI (Fig. 2B) as previously described (22Takai T. Li M. Sylvestre D. Clynes R. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1994; 76: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). However, reconstitution of the deficient cells with wild type or mutant forms of FcRγ restored normal levels of FcϵRI expression (Fig. 2, B and C). We tested the functional response of the FcRγ-reconstituted cells to assess whether the individual mutations of Tyr47 or Tyr58 might reveal differences in cellular signaling and responses. Fig. 3A shows that in contrast to YY-reconstituted cells or to wild type cells, mutation of either Tyr47 or Tyr58 caused ablation of mast cell degranulation similar to that seen with FF mutants. A test of cytokine responses also revealed that induction of cytokines was impaired, since production of tumor necrosis factor was not observed (Fig. 3B). Production of IL-6 and IL-13 was also impaired, but a trend toward a very weak, but not significant, production of MCP-1 was seen in all mutants relative to FcϵRIγ-null cells upon FcϵRI stimulation (supplemental Fig. 1). We do not exclude the possibility that tumor necrosis factor was produced and retained in the secretory granule compartment, since this was not examined. However, the failure to secrete substantial amounts of MCP-1, a cytokine that is not stored in secretory granules and that is produced in response to a very weak stimulus (23Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Odom S. Olivera A. Hobson J.P. Martinez M.E. Oliveira-Dos-Santos A. Barra L. Spiegel S. Penninger J.M. Rivera J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1453-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggests a probable general impairment of cytokine transcription. Analysis of Syk phosphorylation revealed a moderate and reproducible increase in Syk Tyr352 phosphorylation in cells carrying wild type Tyr58 (FY) (Fig. 3C). This ranged from 20 to 60% of the phosphorylation seen in YY-expressing cells depending on the experiment. Both YF- and FF-expressing cells also elicited very weak Syk phosphorylation following Ag stimulation but were clearly less efficient than FY-expressing cells. This relative difference in Syk phosphorylation was also reflected at the level of phosphorylation of total proteins from these cells (Fig. 3C, bottom). Single cell calcium imaging revealed that FY-expressing cells had significantly higher intracellular calcium levels when compared with YF- or FF-expressing cells. The average calcium response from a minimum of more than 138 cells is shown in Fig. 3D. Supplemental Fig. 2 shows the individual cellular responses observed in a typical experiment. These findings demonstrated that expression of Tyr58 alone can elicit modest Syk phosphorylation and weak calcium responses upon FcϵRI engagement but not degranulation or cytokine secretion. To assess whether the observed effect of Tyr58 on Syk phosphorylation and calcium responses resulted from enhanced phosphorylation of this site relative to Tyr47, the FcϵRI-induced phosphorylation of wild type and the FcRγ mutants was analyzed 2 min poststimulation (at peak phosphorylation), using varying concentrations of Ag. Fig. 4A shows the unanticipated result where phosphorylation of the FY mutant, relative to wild type or to the YF mutant, was minimal. The extent of phosphorylation was Ag concentration-dependent and did not correlate with maximal degranulation seen at 10 ng/ml of Ag (Fig. 3A). This may be due to the more effective activation of negative regulators of degranulation, such as SHIP-1 (24Huber M. Helgason C.D. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Humphries R.K. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7311-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Huber M. Kalesnikoff J. Reth M. Krystal G. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 82: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) at higher Ag concentrations. As expected, no phosphorylation of the FF mutant was observed under any condition. In contrast, no effect on the phosphorylation of FcϵRIβ was observed, and the recovered protein was similar for all immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4B). Thus, these findings suggested that the FY mutant was either weakly phosphor"
https://openalex.org/W2009564006,"Press releases are a popular vehicle to disseminate health information to the lay media. While the quality of press releases issued by scientific conferences and medical journals has been questioned, no efforts to assess pharmaceutical industry press releases have been made. Therefore, we sought to systematically examine pharmaceutical company press releases about original research for measures of quality.Press releases issued by the ten top selling, international pharmaceutical companies in the year 2005 were selected for evaluation. A total of 1028 electronic press releases were issued and 235 were based on original research. More than half (59%) reported results presented at a scientific meeting. Twenty-one percent of releases were not explicit about the source of original data. While harms or adverse events were commonly cited (76%), study limitations were rarely noted (6%). Almost one-third (29%) of releases did not quantify study results. Studies presented in abstract form were subsequently published within at least 20 months in 53% of cases.Pharmaceutical company press releases frequently report basic study details. However, readers should be cautioned by the preliminary nature of the data and lack of identified limitations. Methods to improve the reporting and interpretation of drug company press releases are desirable to prevent misleading media coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2140571309,"Cyclin D1 gene induction is a key event in G1 phase progression. Our previous studies indicated that signaling to cyclin D1 is cell type-dependent because the timing of cyclin D1 gene expression in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells is very different, with epithelial cells first expressing cyclin D1 in early rather than mid-G1 phase. In this report, we induced a mesenchymal phenotype in MCF10A cells by long-term exposure to TGF-β and used the control and transitioned cells to examine cell type specificity of the signaling pathways that regulate cyclin D1 gene expression. We show that early-G1 phase cyclin D1 gene expression in MCF10A cells is under the control of Rac, whereas mid-G1 phase cyclin D1 induction requires parallel signaling from Rac and ERK, both in the control and transitioned cells. This combined requirement for Rac and ERK signaling is associated with an increased requirement for intracellular tension, Rb phosphorylation, and S phase entry. A similar co-regulation of cyclin D1 mRNA by Rac and ERK is seen in primary mesenchymal cells. Overall, our results reveal two mechanistically distinct phases of Rac-dependent cyclin D1 expression and emphasize that the acquisition of Rac/ERK co-dependence is required for the mid-G1 phase induction of cyclin D1 associated with S phase entry.

IntroductionCells control their rates of proliferation by sensing external cues in their microenvironment. Cell cycle progression is dependent on these external cues until a time in late G1 phase, called the restriction point, when cells enter the committed and intrinsically controlled portion of the cell cycle (1Blagosklonny M.V. Pardee A.B. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The restriction point is thought to occur after activation of the two G1 phase cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), 2The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; QPCR, quantitative real-time RT-PCR; siRNA, short interfering RNA; CCD, cytochalasin D; MOI, multiplicity of infection; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine. cyclin D-cdk4 (or its homolog cdk6; hereafter called cdk4/6), and cyclin E-cdk2. A D-type cyclin (mostly cyclin D1 in fibroblastic and epithelial cells) is usually the first of the periodically expressed cyclins to be induced in G1 phase of the cell cycle after reentry from quiescence.The levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein are low in quiescent cells and increase during progression through G1 phase (2Bohmer R.M.

Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In mesenchymal cells, activation of integrins by the extracellular matrix (ECM) transmits the adhesion signal to the cyclin D1 gene. Epithelial cell proliferation also requires signals from integrins, but these cells are also strongly influenced by cell-cell adhesion, which is mediated, at least in large part, by E-cadherin (4Fournier A.K.

Cell Res. 2000; 261: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The induction of cyclin D1 mRNA requires a sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), ∼5–6 h after mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells, at least in fibroblasts (7Villanueva J.

Growth factor receptors and integrins collaboratively regulate the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade (14Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar), and this allows for sustained ERK activity in cells that have active Rho (3Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Activated ERK translocates to the nucleus where it stimulates cyclin D1 transcription in mid-G1 phase. The ERK-dependent immediate-early genes, Jun-B and Fra-1, have been implicated in the ERK-stimulated transcription of the cyclin D1 gene (8Balmanno K. Cook S.J.

Rac signaling to cyclin D1 mRNA is thought to be jointly regulated by growth factor receptors and integrins: both receptor systems can support GTP loading of Rac, and integrin-mediated adhesion is required for the coupling of Rac to its effectors (21Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, Rac-dependent induction of cyclin D1 mRNA is not seen unless Rho signaling is inhibited (3Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because Rho inhibition blocks stress fiber formation, Rac signaling to cyclin D1 does not require a high intracellular tensional environment. Rac-dependent cyclin D1 gene expression is readily detected in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells (4Fournier A.K. Campbell L.E. Castagnino P. Liu W.F. Chung B.M. Weaver V.M. Chen C.S. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the absence of well-defined actin stress fibers indicate that these cells do not have the high levels of intracellular tension characteristic of mesenchymal cells.Rac and ERK signaling have distinguishable effects on the timing of cyclin D1 gene expression within G1 phase, with Rac signaling resulting in an early G1 phase expression of cyclin D1 while ERK signaling results in the mid-G1 phase induction of cyclin D1 (3Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 4Fournier A.K. Campbell L.E. Castagnino P. Liu W.F. Chung B.M.

Thus, little is known about the potential interplay between endogenous ERK and Rac activities as it relates to expression of the cyclin D1 gene within a single cell type.When MCF10A cells are treated with TGF-β for 3 days, they acquire a mesenchymal phenotype in a process that resembles an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (22Maeda M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We exploited this approach to study the interplay between endogenous ERK and Rac signaling to cyclin D1 mRNA in a cell type-specific manner yet within cells of the same origin. Our results identify two effects of endogenous Rac signaling on cyclin D1 gene expression, which can be distinguished by cell type (epithelial versus mesenchymal), the dependence or independence from ERK activity, a requirement for intracellular tension, and the ability to support Rb phosphorylation and S phase entry.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—MCF10A mammary epithelial cells were maintained in 1:1 low glucose DMEM:Ham's F12 nutrient media supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), growth factor mixture (20 ng/ml EGF (BD Biosciences), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (List Biologicals)), and 1% gentamicin (Invitrogen). Near confluent MCF10A cells were starved for 48 h in 1:1 DMEM:Ham's F12 nutrient medium with 1 mg/ml heat-inactivated, fatty acid-free BSA. The quiescent cells were trypsinized and suspended in serum-free media for 30 min at 37 °C prior to reseeding (at 2–3 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish) with mitogens comprised of 10% FBS plus a growth factor mixture unless noted otherwise. Primary mouse vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were collected from 2–3-month-old male C57BL/6 aortic explants, and used at passages 2–5. To synchronize cells in G0, VSMCs were grown to ∼90% confluence and serum-starved for 48–72 h in DMEM with 1 mg/ml heat-inactivated, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Unless pretreated with a pharmacological inhibitor, serum-starved VSMCs were directly stimulated with 10% FBS.In some experiments, trypsinized MCF10A (2–3 × 105 cells/ml) or VSMCs (2–3 × 104 cells/ml) were suspended in starvation media and preincubated in suspension (30 min at 37 °C) with vehicle (DMSO) or 50 μm U0126 (Promega). MCF10A cells were also preincubated for a 30-min suspension with 1 μm cytochalasin D (CCD; EMD Biosciences). The treated cells were then reseeded with the appropriate mitogens in the continued presence of the inhibitors.RNA Interference and Adenoviral Infection—siRNA-mediated knockdown was performed as previously described (23Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The siRNA oligonucleotide sequences for human E-cadherin, human Rac1, and mouse Rac1 have been previously reported (23Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and those for p21 were: No. 1: AACAUACUGGCCUGGACUGtt and No. 2: AUCGUCCAGCGACCUUCCUtt. All siRNA oligonucleotides were used at 150 nm. Adenoviruses were titered and used as described (23Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RacN17 adenovirus was a generous gift from Anne Ridley (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University College London, UK).Induction of a Mesenchymal Phenotype in MCF10A Cells— MCF10A cells in maintenance medium were seeded at low confluence (3 × 105 and 6 × 105 cells for control and TGF-β-treated cells, respectively) in 100-mm dishes containing autoclaved glass coverslips. A mesenchymal phenotype was induced similar to Maeda et al. (22Maeda M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) by incubating the cells for 3 days in maintenance medium with 3 ng/ml human recombinant TGF-β1 (R&D Systems). The transitioned cells were serum-starved for 2 days in the continued presence of TGF-β. Duplicate cultures were incubated in parallel without TGF-β. Each dish of quiescent control and TGF-β-treated cells was then trypsinized, reseeded into two 100-mm dishes coated with 1.27 μg/cm2 collagen (containing autoclaved coverslips), and stimulated with 10% FBS and growth factor mixture in DMEM:F12 in the continued absence or presence of TGF-β.Rho and Rac GTPase Activity Assays—MCF10A cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 104 cells/well (control cells) or 2 × 104 cells/well (TGF-β-treated cells). Cells were treated for 3 days ± 3 ng/ml TGF-β and starved for 2 days. The cells were stimulated with 10% FBS and the growth factor mixture. Protein was collected and quantified, and active Rho and Rac GTPase levels were measured using G-LISA small G-protein activation assay kits (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions.Other Methods—BrdU incorporation and E-cadherin surface expression was determined by epifluorescence microscopy performed as described (23Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). F-actin staining was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-phalloidin (Invitrogen).Total RNA was prepared from collected cells and analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QPCR) as described (23Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Taqman primer and probe sequences for human cyclin D1 mRNA and 18S rRNA have been listed previously (23Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Immediate-early gene induction was analyzed by SYBR Green QPCR using the following primers (forward and reverse pairs, respectively): human Fra-1 CAGGCGGAGACTGACAAACT and CTTCCAGCACCAGCTCTAGG and mouse Fra-1 ACCGAAGAAAGGAGCTGACA and CTGCTTCTGCAGCTCTTCAA. The expression of mesenchymal markers was determined using Taqman Assay-On-Demand primers and probes (Applied Biosystems): fibronectin, Hs00415006_m1; vimentin, Hs00185584_m1; snail, Hs00195591_m1; and slug, Hs00161904_m1. RNA expression was quantified by standard curve. QPCR results were normalized to 18S rRNA levels and show the mean ± S.D. of duplicate PCR reactions.For Western blotting, cells were collected and extracted as described (3Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and total cellular protein (∼40 μg) was fractionated on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and blotted using standard procedures. Filters were probed with the following antibodies: cyclin D1 (sc-718, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), dually phosphorylated ERK (P-ERK, 9101S, Cell Signaling), ERK (610030, BD Biosciences), Rac (05-389, UBI), actin (sc-8432, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GAPDH (sc-25778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21 (sc-6246, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p27 (610241, BD Biosciences), E-cadherin (13–1700, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), Rb (OP77, Oncogene), phospho-Rb S780 (P-Rb S780, 9307, Cell Signaling), and phospho-Rb S807/S811 (P-Rb S807/S811, ab4783, Abcam). Resolved proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Autoradiograms were digitized by scanning, and figures were assembled in Illustrator (Adobe).RESULTSDifferential Expression of Cyclin D1 in MCF10A Cells before and after Acquisition of a Mesenchymal Phenotype—Our previous studies in MCF10A cells and fibroblasts indicated that the timing of cyclin D1 gene induction might be cell type-specific with an early-G1 phase induction in epithelial cells and a mid-G1 phase induction in mesenchymal cells (3Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 4Fournier A.K. Campbell L.E. Castagnino P. Liu W.F. Chung B.M.

Cell. 2007; 18: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To address this issue without using distinct cell lines, we induced a mesenchymal phenotype in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A cells) by a 3-day treatment with TGF-β. TGF-β efficiently induced a mesenchymal phenotype as assessed by loss of cell-cell contacts, appearance of actin stress fibers, and loss of membrane-localized E-cadherin (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous reports (22Maeda M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 24Peinado H. Quintanilla M. Cano A. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar), the transcription factors snail and slug, as well as their downstream targets, fibronectin and vimentin, were also induced (Fig. 1B). Thus, this system allows us to explore cell type-specific signaling to cyclin D1 mRNA without use of overexpression or cells of different origins.We serum-starved control and TGF-β-treated MCF10A cells and monitored the expression of cyclin D1 mRNA during a 12-h period (the time when cyclin D1 appears in fibroblastic cells). Interestingly, the early-G1 phase induction of cyclin D1 mRNA seen in control MCF10A cells (Fig. 2A, Control, 3 h) was lost after TGF-β treatment: cyclin D1 mRNA was now induced in mid-G1 phase (Fig. 2A; TGF-β, 9–12 h) as it is in fibroblasts. A similar shift in the kinetics of cyclin D1 protein expression was seen before and after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 2B). When control cells were treated with TGF-β for 12 h (which was an insufficient time to induce the mesenchymal phenotype; not shown), the early-G1 phase induction of cyclin D1 was retained (Fig. 2C). Thus, the change in cyclin D1 expression kinetics is associated with the transition to a mesenchymal phenotype rather than simple exposure to TGF-β.FIGURE 2The expression of cyclin D1 in MCF10A cells is regulated by TGF-β treatment. A, serum-starved control or TGF-β treated MCF10A cells were trypsinized and reseeded on collagen-coated dishes and stimulated with 10% FBS and growth factor mixture. Total RNA was collected 0–12 h after mitogenic stimulation, and levels of cyclin D1 mRNA in control (♦) and TGF-β-treated (▪) MCF10A cells were determined by QPCR. Results are shown as mean and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments; *, p = 0.049 n = 3; **, p = 0.016 n = 4, one-tailed Student's t test. B, serum-starved control or TGF-β-treated MCF10A cells were trypsinized and reseeded on collagen-coated dishes and stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF for the times indicated. Lysates from collected cells were Western-blotted with the indicated antibodies. C, serum-starved MCF10A cells were stimulated with 10% FBS and growth factor mixture in the absence or presence of TGF-β for 0–12 h. Lysates from collected cells were Western-blotted with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Loss of E-cadherin and the appearance of actin stress fibers are two hallmarks of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (22Maeda M.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). To determine if the change in cyclin D1 expression kinetics in TGF-β-treated MCF10A cells was due to loss of E-cadherin, we transfected control MCF10A cells with E-cadherin siRNA. E-cadherin depletion led to the loss of cell-cell adhesions (Fig. 3A), and consistent with our previous report showing that E-cadherin-mediated adhesion contributes to cyclin D1 mRNA expression (4Fournier A.K. Campbell L.E. Castagnino P. Liu W.F. Chung B.M. Weaver V.M. Chen C.S. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), MCF10A cells treated with E-cadherin siRNA had lower levels of cyclin D1 (Fig. 3C). However, E-cadherin knock-down was not sufficient to induce mesenchymal markers (Fig. 3B), nor did it generate mesenchymal expression kinetics of cyclin D1: near constitutive expression persisted between 3 and 9 h after mitogenic stimulation (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Loss of E-cadherin does not phenocopy the cyclin D1 induction kinetics seen after TGF-β treatment. A–C, MCF10A cells were transfected with either nonspecific siRNA or E-cadherin siRNA and starved for 48 h. A, cells were reseeded in 10% FBS with growth factor mixture, fixed 9 h after reseeding, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin or anti-E-cadherin. Scale bar, 50 μm. B, cells were reseeded and stimulated with 10% FBS and growth factor mixture in the presence or absence of TGF-β (3 ng/ml) for 72 h. Total RNA was collected and analyzed for expression of mesenchymal markers: fibronectin (FN), slug, snail, and vimentin (vim) by QPCR. Inset, lysates analyzed by Western blotting to confirm E-cadherin knockdown relative to GAPDH (loading control). C, cells were reseeded in 10% FBS with growth factor mixture, and cell lysates were collected at the indicated times and analyzed by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cyclin D1 Gene Expression in MCF10A Cells Occurs in Two Distinct Phases with Differing Requirements for Cytoskeletal Integrity—We then tested the importance of actin polymerization and intracellular tension on early- and mid-G1 phase cyclin D1 gene expression by treating control and transitioned MCF10A cells with CCD. CCD treatment blocked mid-G1 phase cyclin D1 mRNA expression both before and after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 4A, 9 h). In contrast, the early G1 phase induction of cyclin D1 seen in control MCF10A cells was relatively resistant to CCD (Fig. 4A, 3 h).FIGURE 4Two phases of cyclin D1 gene expression distinguished by their dependence on cytoskeletal tension. A, starved control and transitioned MCF10A cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle) or 1 μm CCD prior to reseeding on collagen-coated dishes and stimulation with 10% FBS and growth factor mixture. Total RNA was collected at indicated times and analyzed by QPCR. B and C, starved control and TGF-β-treated MCF10A cells were stimulated (without reseeding) with 10% FBS and growth factor mixture. Lysates were prepared at the indicated times, and Rac (B) or Rho (C) GTPase activities were measured using G-LISA kits as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GTPase activities were normalized to serum-starved MCF10A cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because our previous studies indicated that early-G1 phase cyclin D1 gene expression is mediated by Rac and repressed by Rho in fibroblasts (3Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), it was possible that our ability to detect early-G1 phase cyclin D1 mRNA in control MCF10A cells was due to an increased level of Rac signaling or a reduced level of Rho signaling relative to that found after TGF-β treatment. This potential mechanism would also be consistent with the increase in actin stress fibers seen after TGF-β treatment. However, we found that Rac and Rho GTP levels were similar in control and TGF-β-treated MCF10A cells (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). Collectively, these data indicate that there are two distinct phases of cyclin D1 expression in MCF10A cells (early- and mid-G1 phase), which are resolvable on the basis of their requirements for an organized actin cytoskeleton. If changes in Rac and Rho signaling differentially regulate these two phases, these changes must be imposed downstream of GTP loading.The Two Phases of Cyclin D1 Gene Expression Require Rac Activity and Are Distinguished by Their Requirement for ERK Activity—We asked whether ERK activity is required for cyclin D1 induction in MCF10A cells both before and after transition to a mesenchymal phenotype by incubating control and TGF-β-treated MCF10A cells with the MEK inhibitor, U0126. U0126 either had little effect (not shown) or increased (Fig. 5A, 3 h) early-G1 phase cyclin D1 expression in MCF10A cells. In contrast, U0126 strongly inhibited cyclin D1 mRNA induction in mid-G1 phase in MCF10A cells both before (Fig. 5A, 12 h) and after (Fig. 5B, 12 h) TGF-β treatment. Intermediate time points showed an intermediate dependence on ERK activity (Fig. 5A, 9 h), likely reflecting the transition from ERK-independent to ERK-dependent cyclin D1 gene expression.FIGURE 5Role of ERK activity in cyclin D1 expression in MCF10A cells. A and B, starved control (A) and TGF-β-treated (B) MCF10A cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 50 μm U0126 for 30 min prior to seeding on collagen-coated dishes and stimulation with 10% FBS and growth factor mixture in the continued absence or presence of TGF-β. Total RNA was collected at the indicated times and cyclin D1 mRNA levels were measured by QPCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As opposed to ERK activity, we found that inhibition of Rac using either a dominant negative mutant (N17) or Rac1 siRNA efficiently blocked both the early (3 h) and mid (9–12 h) G1 phase cyclin D1 mRNA expression (Fig. 6, A and B). The Rac requirement was retained in MCF10A cells that had undergone TGF-β treatment (Fig. 6A). Thus, the early- and mid-G1 phase expression of cyclin D1 are both dependent on Rac but can be distinguished by their requirem"
https://openalex.org/W2015069185,"DsbA is an enzyme found in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria that catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds in a diverse array of protein substrates, many of which are involved in bacterial pathogenesis. Although most bacteria possess only a single essential DsbA, Neisseria meningitidis is unusual in that it possesses three DsbAs, although the reason for this additional redundancy is unclear. Two of these N. meningitidis enzymes (NmDsbA1 and NmDsbA2) play an important role in meningococcal attachment to human epithelial cells, whereas NmDsbA3 is considered to have a narrow substrate repertoire. To begin to address the role of DsbAs in the pathogenesis of N. meningitidis, we have determined the structure of NmDsbA3 to 2.3-Å resolution. Although the sequence identity between NmDsbA3 and other DsbAs is low, the NmDsbA3 structure adopted a DsbA-like fold. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrated that NmDsbA3 acts as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase in vitro and is reoxidized by Escherichia coli DsbB (EcDsbB). However, pronounced differences in the structures between DsbA3 and EcDsbA, which are clustered around the active site of the enzyme, suggested a structural basis for the unusual substrate specificity that is observed for NmDsbA3.

Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of epidemic meningitis, is a significant public health burden worldwide causing 1.2 million cases per year globally, with an estimated fatality rate of 10% (WHO) (1Stephens D.S. Greenwood B. Brandtzaeg P. Lancet. 2007; 369: 2196-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The disease is difficult to diagnose in the clinic because onset symptoms are similar to influenza, and delays in the administration of antibiotics has been directly correlated with death of the patient, since the rapid progression of the disease from bacteremia and/or meningitis to life threatening septic shock syndrome can occur within the first few hours after the initial symptoms appear. Because of these parameters, vaccination is the preferred option for the control of this disease in the community. Meningococci express one of five capsular serogroups (A, B, C, W-135, and Y) and successful vaccines based upon four of these polysaccharides are available (1Stephens D.S. Greenwood B. Brandtzaeg P. Lancet. 2007; 369: 2196-2210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). There is no vaccine candidate for serogroup B isolates as this capsular type mimics human antigens and is therefore a poor immunogen. As a consequence there is still considerable interest in examining the pathogenic mechanisms of this organism as this knowledge may lead to an improved understanding of the development of infection and disease, which may provide novel avenues to treatment.To initiate disease, N. meningitidis must invade non-ciliated cells of the mucosal epithelium lining the human nasopharynx, translocate into the subepithelial tissue, and gain access to the bloodstream (2Stephens D.S. McGee Z.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1981; 143: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this compartment, the bacteria grow to high density ultimately resulting in the clinical syndrome of septic shock (3Bourdoulous S. Nassif X. Frosch M. Maiden M.C.J. Handbook of Meningococcal Disease. WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co, Weiheim, Germany2006Google Scholar). A diverse array of virulence factors have been implicated in this process (3Bourdoulous S. Nassif X. Frosch M. Maiden M.C.J. Handbook of Meningococcal Disease. WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co, Weiheim, Germany2006Google Scholar) including thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases of the Dsb family (4Tinsley C.R. Voulhoux R. Beretti J.L. Tommassen J. Nassif X. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The family is responsible both for introducing disulfide bonds into nascent polypeptides in the periplasm and, where necessary, for reshuffling incorrectly formed disulfides to enable productive protein folding. There are several members of the Dsb family with distinct roles: DsbA catalyzes the oxidation of a wide range of substrate proteins via an efficient thioldisulfide transfer mechanism.Many of the DsbA substrates are involved in bacterial pathogenesis. Reduced DsbA, which is formed in the reaction, is re-oxidized by a membrane-bound partner, DsbB. DsbA/B form the oxidative system that is primarily responsible for the formation of new disulfide bonds in substrates within the periplasm. For substrates that contain more than one pair of cysteine residues, there exists the possibility that disulfides may be linked incorrectly by DsbA, hence a second, complementary system exists to catalyze disulfide isomerization; DsbC and its membrane-bound reductive partner DsbD (Ref. 11Nakamoto H. Bardwell J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, and references therein).Interestingly, most Gram-negative organisms possess only a single DsbA and inactivation of the gene results in complete loss of virulence. This has been ascribed to the loss of function and increased degradation rates of misfolded substrates of DsbA (12Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 13Hizukuri Y. Yakushi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4190-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Dsb system of Escherichia coli is the best characterized and is widely used as a paradigm for the Dsb systems of other Gram-negative bacteria. In E. coli, there is a single DsbA enzyme (EcDsbA), which is responsible for oxidation of a diverse array of protein substrates. E. coli express several hundred potential DsbA substrates, i.e. proteins that are predicted to enter the periplasm and contain at least one pair of cysteine residues (14Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Typically dsbA-null E. coli show reduced levels of proteins that contain disulfides (6Bardwell J.C.

Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The latter renders dsbA-null E. coli non-motile.In contrast, bioinformatic analysis suggests that N. meningitidis has fewer potential DsbA substrates, but unusually, it possesses three chromosomally encoded oxidoreductases, NmDsbA1, NmDsbA2, and NmDsbA3. NmDsbA1 and NmDsbA2 share 78% amino acid identity, are lipoproteins that are anchored in the periplasmic membrane, and are both necessary for the formation of “functional” Type IV pili (4Tinsley C.R. Voulhoux R. Beretti J.L. Tommassen J. Nassif X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27078-27087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). NmDsbA1/NmDsbA2 double mutants express intact pilin fibers, but are deficient in attachment to cell lines. In addition, they have decreased transformation rates, which has been ascribed to a reduction in the level of expression of functional PilQ, the outer membrane porin through which the Type IV pili are extruded (15Sinha S. Ambur O.H. Langford P.R. Tonjum T. Kroll J.S. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that NmDsbA3, which is not membrane anchored and has 57 and 51% sequence identity with NmDsbA1 and NmDsbA2, respectively, is unable to compensate for the loss of NmDsbA1/2. The ability of each of the Neisserial DsbA enzymes to complement dsbA-null E. coli has also been tested (16Sinha S. Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2993-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although NmDsbA1 restored motility, NmDsbA2 and NmDsbA3 did not (16Sinha S. Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2993-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, EcDsbA and NmDsbA2 were able to fully restore AP activity in dsbA-null E. coli to wild type levels, NmDsbA1 partially restored AP activity and NmDsbA3 had no effect on AP activity (16Sinha S. Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2993-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).These observations suggest that the meningococcal oxidoreductases display preferred substrate recognition patterns and therefore are likely to be involved in multiple and distinct processes of meningococcal pathogenesis. To begin to define the role of the Neisserial DsbA oxidoreductases in meningococcal pathogenesis and establish the basis for separate substrate specificities for these enzymes, we have determined the 2.3-Å resolution structure of NmDsbA3. In addition we have determined the oxidoreductase activity of NmDsbA3 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that NmDsbA3 functions as a disulfide oxidase, but that differences in the active site correlate with its limited substrate repertoire. Collectively, these studies suggest a structural basis for substrate specificity in the DsbA family in N. meningitidis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture ConditionsE. coli strain JM109 was used as the recipient for cloning experiments, whereas E. coli strains JCB570 and JCB571 (kindly provided by James Bardwell, University of Michigan) were used for complementation assays. E. coli strains were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl (w/v)) at 37 °C with shaking (220 rpm) or on LB containing 1% agar (w/v). The growth medium was supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/μl), chloramphenicol (30 μg/μl), isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.3 mm), or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (20 μg/ml) as required.Recombinant DNA TechniquesUnless otherwise stated recombinant standard DNA techniques were used throughout (17Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid extractions were conducted using the High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Sciences), whereas PCR products were purified using Qiagen PCR purification kit. Sterile H2O supplemented with 1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.0) was used in place of the commercial elution buffer in both kits. Yield and quality of DNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis.The N. meningitidis dsbA3 gene was amplified from N. meningitidis strain MC58 using DAP103 (5′-catgccatggcgaaaggaaataattatgaagctc-3′) and DAP104 (5′-catgccatggcttgcgcttctttcggatacg-3′), whereas the E. coli dsbA was amplified from E. coli strain JM109 using KAP13 (5′-catgccatgggagccgacttttatagaacaggc-3′) and KAP14 (5′-gctctagagaaataatgtccagcggcaggatgc-3′). The amplified fragments were cloned into the low copy expression vector pHSG576 to create plasmids pJKD2719 containing NmdsbA3 and pCMK255 containing EcdsbA, respectively. The NmdsbA3, and EcdsbA genes were excised by flanking NcoI sites from pJKD2719 and pCMK255, respectively, and cloned into the high copy expression vector pTrc99A to create plasmids pJKD2645 and pCMK268. Inserts were confirmed by sequencing on an ABI Prism 3730 48 capillary automated DNA sequencer using primers KAP96 (5′-agcggataacaatttcacacagga-3′) and KAP97 (5′-gttttcccagtcacgac-3′) or DAP381 (5′-gagcggataacaatttcacacagg-3′) and DAP382 (5′-cgtgcacccaactgatcttcagc-3′) as appropriate. Plasmids pHSG576 (18Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), pCMK255, and pJKD2719 were transformed into the E. coli dsbA mutant strain JCB571 as described previously (19Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) creating strains CKEC271, CKEC272, and CKEC276. Plasmids pTrc99A, pCMK268, and pJKD2645 were transformed into the E. coli dsbA mutant strain JCB571 creating the strains CKEC288, CKEC289, and CKEC293, respectively.NmDsbA3 with an N-terminal His fusion was created by SOE-PCR. The His-enterokinase cleavage site fragment was amplified from expression vector pET45b(+) (Invitrogen) using primers KAP159 (5′-gactcactataggggaattgtgagc-3′) and KAP167 (5′-ggcatacttgtcgtcgtcatcattcgaacc-3′). The NmDsbA3 gene was amplified from NMB chromosomal DNA with primers KAP166 (5′-gacaagtatgccctgacggaaggggaagac-3′) and DAP269 (5′-cccaagcttggcaaacactaccgccaaaactgc-3′). Primers KAP167 and KAP166 contained complementary sequences that allowed PCR amplification of both fragments in a second round PCR with primers KAP161 (5′-ggaattgtgagcggataacaattccc-3′) and KAP168 (5′-gcaagcttctatttctgtacagcaggggtctgac-3′). This PCR fragment was then digested with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site of expression vector pET45b(+) to create the expression vector pCMK140.Protein Expression and PurificationEcDsbA was expressed and purified as described previously (20Martin J.L. Waksman G. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). His6-tagged NmDsbA3 was expressed in BL21 C43 cells using autoinduction (21Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4016) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells harboring pET45b-NmDsbA3 were grown with agitation at 200 revolutions min-1 for 48 h at 293 K in minimal medium (21Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4016) Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml-1). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using Bugbuster™ (Novagen) according to the manufacturers instructions. The cleared lysate was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (GE Healthcare) and washed with a buffer containing KH2PO4 (10 mm), NaCl (300 mm), and imidazole (20 mm) (pH 8.0) and eluted on a gradient from 20 to 500 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those containing NmDsbA3 were concentrated and buffer exchanged using an Amicon 5000 MWCO spin concentrator (Millipore) into HEPES (10 mm) (pH 6.8). The resulting solution was applied to a cation exchange column (Mono S HR 5/5, GE Healthcare) and NmDsbA3 eluted on a NaCl gradient (0–250 mm) in buffer B. NmDsbA3 was chemically oxidized (1.7 mm copper(II) phenanthroline) or reduced (10 mm dithiothreitol). Oxidizing or reducing agents were removed by gel filtration (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare) in Buffer C (10 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl).Native NmDsbA3 protein for crystallographic studies was expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 Codon Plus cells (Stratagene) transformed with pJKD2645. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg ml-1) until an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 was reached. Cultures were induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, grown for a further 5 h, and harvested by centrifugation. Periplasmic proteins were released by resuspending the cell pellet in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl containing polymyxin B sulfate (1 mg ml-1) for 2 h at room temperature. The resulting cultures were clarified (16,000 × g for 30 min) and purified chromatographically. In the first step, ammonium sulfate (1 m) was added to the periplasmic extract, which was filtered and applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (Phenyl HP 16/10 column (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted on an ammonium sulfate gradient (1 → 0 m) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those containing NmDsbA3 were pooled and diafiltered (Amicon Ultra 5, Millipore) into 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.8). The protein was purified further using MonoS and gel filtration as described above. Selenomethionine-labeled NmDsbA3 was expressed from E. coli B384 in minimal media containing selenomethionine using the protocol described by Marley et al. (22Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The protein was purified as described above and concentrated to 20 mg ml-1 for crystallization.Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction Data CollectionSelenomethionine-labeled NmDsbA3 was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of precipitant solution (20% PEG 4000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 m sodium acetate) and incubated at 294 K. Crystals appeared within 4 days and grew as thin plates to dimensions 0.4 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm. The crystals were mounted in nylon loops and passed through a solution of mother liquor plus 20% (v/v) glycerol prior to flash-cooling in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at wavelengths corresponding to the peak (0.97939 Å) and inflection (0.97952 Å) of the selenium absorption edge and at a remote wavelength (0.97242 Å). 360° of data were collected for each wavelength with 0.5° oscillations at beamline 23ID-B GM/CA of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratories, from a single crystal mounted 260 mm from a Quantum 4 CCD detector. The crystal was of space group P21, with unit cell dimensions a = 54.5 b = 88.6 c = 84.4 Å, β = 106.9° and diffracted to beyond 2.3 Å. The data were processed and scaled with DENZO (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). Due to significant radiation damage to the crystal only the peak wavelength was used for subsequent structural determination. The data collection statistics of the peak wavelength are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1X-ray data collection and processing statistics Values in parentheses represent those of the highest resolution shell 2.38-2.30 Å.Space groupP21Cell dimensions (Å)a = 54.5 b = 88.5 c = 84.3, β = 106.9°Resolution (Å)50-2.3RsymaRsym = ΣhΣl|Ihl – 〈I(h)〉|/hΣl〈Ih〉, where Ihl is the lth observation of reflection h and 〈Ih〉 is the weighted average intensity for all observations l of reflection h4.8 (27.8)I/σI43.3 (5.0)Completeness (%)94 (65)Redundancy5.2RefinementResolution (Å)30-2.3Reflections in working set34,110RfactorbRfactor = Σhkl||Fo| – |Fc||/Σhkl|Fo| for all data excluding the 5% that comprised the Rfree used for cross-validation0.210RfreebRfactor = Σhkl||Fo| – |Fc||/Σhkl|Fo| for all data excluding the 5% that comprised the Rfree used for cross-validation0.263Total residuesA chain3–187B chain3–187C chain3–188D chain3–186Total protein atoms5,863Total waters176Bond lengths (Å)0.009Bond angles (°)1.197Ramachandran analysisMost favored (%)91.8Additionally allowed (%)8.2Average B factor (Å2)58.5a Rsym = ΣhΣl|Ihl – 〈I(h)〉|/hΣl〈Ih〉, where Ihl is the lth observation of reflection h and 〈Ih〉 is the weighted average intensity for all observations l of reflection hb Rfactor = Σhkl||Fo| – |Fc||/Σhkl|Fo| for all data excluding the 5% that comprised the Rfree used for cross-validation Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and RefinementMAD phasing was pursued as earlier attempts at molecular replacement using related DsbA structures in the Protein Data Bank were unsuccessful. Due to radiation damage to the crystal the inflection and remote wavelength datasets were ignored and a SAD phasing approach using only the peak wavelength dataset to a maximum resolution of 3.0 Å was employed. SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) was used to determine the positions of the 16 selenium atoms and subsequent density modification was performed by RESOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of the modified electron density map revealed that each of the 4 copies of NmDsbA3 adopted a DsbA-like fold. The four molecules of NmDsbA3 in the asymmetric unit were arranged as a crystallographic tetramer, although there is no evidence for DsbA3 acting as a physiological tetramer and moreover DsbA3 behaved as a monomer on gel filtration. In this crystallographic tetrameric arrangement the catalytic cysteines at position 37 were within 5 Å of their non-crystallographically related symmetry equivalents. However, there was no continuous electron density observed indicative of the presence of intermolecular disulfide bonds. This is consistent with DsbA3 being in its reduced state.MOLREP (25Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Biol. 1997; 268: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (PDB accession code 1BED) into the modified electron density map. The model was improved by iterative rounds of manual building in COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22822) Google Scholar) and maximum-likelihood based refinement in REFMAC, with TLS (25Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar, 29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13781) Google Scholar). Strict NCS restraints were applied in the early rounds of refinement and were subsequently loosened and then removed for the final round of refinement. Solvent molecules were added with COOT and checked by visual inspection of Fo - Fc maps. The structure was validated using the Ramachandran plot, density fit, rotamer, and geometry analysis as implemented in COOT. Manual model building was continued until no peaks greater or less than 4σ were present in a Fo - Fc difference Fourier electron density map. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The final coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2ZNM.Insulin Reduction AssayOxidoreductase activity was measured by following the rate of precipitation of the insulin B chain from solution in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) (30Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl containing 1 mm EDTA. The reaction mixtures contained insulin (100 μm) plus either EcDsbA or His6-NmDsbA3 (5 μm). The reaction was initiated by addition of DTT (2 mm) and the rate of precipitation was monitored from the increased turbidity of the reaction mixture, which was measured as the absorbance at 650 nm. Absorbance measurements were made in a 1-cm cell using a Cary50 spectrophotometer (Varian). The rate of insulin reduction by DTT in the absence of DsbA was measured as a control.Reoxidation of DsbA by EcDsbBThe reoxidation of EcDsbA and His6-NmDsbA3 by EcDsbB was measured as previously described (31Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10302-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An EcDsbB overproducing strain, JCB851, was a kind gift from James Bardwell (University of Michigan). EcDsbB was expressed and purified as previously described (31Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10302-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Oxidation of DsbA was detected by following the time dependent change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence that accompanies formation of the disulfide bond in DsbA. EcDsbA and NmDsbA3 exhibit similar fluorescence properties, with the reduced form of the protein having significantly higher fluorescence in each case. Fluorescence was measured on a Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (Varian) using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a detection wavelength of 330 nm. 5-nm slit widths were used for both excitation and emission and the temperature was maintained at 30 °C with a Peltier-controlled cell holder. DsbA was reduced immediately prior to the assay with DTT (10 mm). The DTT was removed by gel filtration in Buffer E (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% dodecylmaltoside containing 1 mm EDTA (to prevent aerial oxidation of DsbA)) (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare). Reduced and oxidized EcDsbB have identical intrinsic fluorescence (31Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10302-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), hence the oxidation state of EcDsbB does not contribute to the observed changes.Kinetics of Oxidation of Substrate PeptideDisulfide oxidase activity was measured by following the change in the intrinsic fluorescence of each DsbA upon oxidation of a peptide substrate. The substrate peptide was derived from the mature sequence of the meningoccol pilE2 protein. Synthesis of the acetylated peptide Ac-C(Trt)-Q(Trt)-K(Boc)-G-D(OtBu)-G-T(tBu)-K(Boc)-N(Trt)-Ser(tBu)-C(Trt)-RESIN, was performed on Rink resin under standard solid phase peptide synthesis conditions. Final cleavage and deprotection was carried out using 95% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The product was recovered by a standard sequence of ether precipitation, dissolution in 50% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile, freeze drying followed by HPLC purification and the peptide sequence confirmed by LC-MS. The kinetics of oxidation of the substrate peptide PilE2, by His6-NmDsbA3 and EcDsbA were determined in buffer C using an Applied Photophysics SF.18MV stopped-flow apparatus, thermostatted at 20 °C. Peptide oxidation was followed by monitoring the change in intrinsic fluorescence of the DsbA variants upon reduction at wavelengths >320 nm (λex = 280 nm). A 10-fold molar excess of peptide substrate was used, such that the final concentration of the DsbA variant and peptide were 1 and 10 μm, respectively. Data were fit to a single exponential kinetic model for substrate peptide oxidation rate determination. The oxidation state of the peptide following the reaction with DsbA was determined using LC-MS. For comparison, samples of oxidized and reduced peptide were generated via chemical oxidation with copper phenanthroline (15 mm) or reduction with DTT (100 mm). DsbA in buffer C was added to the reduced peptide at molar ratios between 1:20 and 1:1 of DsbA:peptide. The mixtures were separated by reversed-phase chromatography on an Agilent 1100 HPLC using an Agilent Eclipse C18 column on a gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 20 min. Chromatographic separation was monitored by recording the total ion current and the mass of the peptides in the resulting peaks was analyzed using Agilent 6510 Q-TOF mass spectrometer.Functional Analysis of DsbA ActivityDTT Sensitivity Assays—DTT assays were carried out as previously described (32Sardesai A.A.

https://openalex.org/W2022734904,"The uptake and intracellular trafficking of sphingolipids, which self-associate into plasma membrane microdomains, is associated with many pathological conditions, including viral and toxin infection, lipid storage disease, and neurodegenerative disease. However, the means available to label the trafficking pathways of sphingolipids in live cells are extremely limited. In order to address this problem, we have developed an exogenous, non-toxic probe consisting of a 25-amino acid sphingolipid binding domain, the SBD, derived from the amyloid peptide Abeta, and conjugated by a neutral linker with an organic fluorophore. The current work presents the characterization of the sphingolipid binding and live cell trafficking of this novel probe, the SBD peptide. SBD was the name given to a motif originally recognized by Fantini et al in a number of glycolipid-associated proteins, and was proposed to interact with sphingolipids in membrane microdomains.In accordance with Fantini's model, optimal SBD binding to membranes depends on the presence of sphingolipids and cholesterol. In synthetic membrane binding assays, SBD interacts preferentially with raft-like lipid mixtures containing sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and complex gangliosides in a pH-dependent manner, but is less glycolipid-specific than Cholera toxin B (CtxB). Using quantitative time-course colocalization in live cells, we show that the uptake and intracellular trafficking route of SBD is unlike that of either the non-raft marker Transferrin or the raft markers CtxB and Flotillin2-GFP. However, SBD traverses an endolysosomal route that partially intersects with raft-associated pathways, with a major portion being diverted at a late time point to rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Trafficking of SBD to acidified compartments is strongly disrupted by cholesterol perturbations, consistent with the regulation of sphingolipid trafficking by cholesterol.The current work presents the characterization and trafficking behavior of a novel sphingolipid-binding fluorescent probe, the SBD peptide. We show that SBD binding to membranes is dependent on the presence of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and complex glycolipids. In addition, SBD targeting through the endolysosomal pathway in neurons is highly sensitive to cholesterol perturbations, making it a potentially useful tool for the analysis of sphingolipid trafficking in disease models that involve changes in cholesterol metabolism and storage."
https://openalex.org/W2040017576,"The matrix (M) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) plays a key role in inducing cell apoptosis during infection. To investigate whether M protein-mediated apoptosis could be used in cancer therapy, its cDNA was amplified and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(+). The recombinant plasmid or the control empty plasmid pcDNA3.1(+) was mixed with cationic liposome and introduced into various tumor cell lines in vitro, including lung cancer cell LLC, A549, colon cancer cell CT26 and fibrosarcoma cell MethA. Our data showed that the M protein induced remarkable apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro compared with controls. Fifty micrograms of plasmid in a complex with 250 microg cationic liposome was injected intratumorally into mice bearing LLC or MethA tumor model every 3 days for 6 times. It was found that the tumors treated with M protein plasmid grew much more slowly, and the survival of the mice was significantly prolonged compared with the mice treated with the control plasmid. In MethA fibrosarcoma, the tumors treated with M protein plasmid were even completely regressed, and the mice acquired longtime protection against the same tumor cell in rechallenge experiments. Both apoptotic cells and CD8(+) T cells were widely distributed in M protein plasmid-treated tumor tissue. Activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were further detected by means of (51)Cr release assay in the spleen of the treated mice. These results showed that M protein of VSV can act as both apoptosis inducer and immune response initiator, which may account for its extraordinary antitumor effect and warrant its further development in cancer gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2034744432,"Background Circadian oscillators are endogenous time-keeping mechanisms that drive twenty four hour rhythmic changes in gene expression, metabolism, hormone levels, and physical activity. We have examined the developmental expression of genes known to regulate circadian rhythms in order to better understand the ontogeny of the circadian clock in a vertebrate. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, genes known to function together in part of the core circadian oscillator mechanism (xPeriod1, xPeriod2, and xBmal1) as well as a rhythmic, clock-controlled gene (xNocturnin) were analyzed using in situ hybridization in embryos from neurula to late tailbud stages. Each transcript was present in the developing nervous system in the brain, eye, olfactory pit, otic vesicle and at lower levels in the spinal cord. These genes were also expressed in the developing somites and heart, but at different developmental times in peripheral tissues (pronephros, cement gland, and posterior mesoderm). No difference was observed in transcript levels or localization when similarly staged embryos maintained in cyclic light were compared at two times of day (dawn and dusk) by in situ hybridization. Quantitation of xBmal1 expression in embryonic eyes was also performed using qRT-PCR. Eyes were isolated at dawn, midday, dusk, and midnight (cylic light). No difference in expression level between time-points was found in stage 31 eyes (p = 0.176) but stage 40 eyes showed significantly increased levels of xBmal1 expression at midnight (RQ = 1.98+/−0.094) when compared to dawn (RQ = 1+/−0.133; p = 0.0004). Conclusions/Significance We hypothesize that when circadian genes are not co-expressed in the same tissue during development that it may indicate pleiotropic functions of these genes that are separate from the timing of circadian rhythm. Our results show that all circadian genes analyzed thus far are present during early brain and eye development, but rhythmic gene expression in the eye is not observed until after stage 31 of development."

Chips were normalized with Robust Microarray Analysis (RMA) in R using Bioconductor. Significant differential gene expression levels were detected using mixed effects modeling and Statistical Analysis of Microarray (SAM). Functional analysis and Gene Ontology were used to classify differentially expressed genes. Differential gene expression was validated by quantitative real time RT-PCR. Protein levels were detected by Western blots and ELISA. Cell adhesion and migration assays tested physiological responses. Glutathione (GSH) assay detected levels of intracellular GSH.Multiple analyses selected 87 genes differentially expressed between normal AA and CA (P<0.01). The most relevant genes expressed in AA were categorized by function, including: signal transduction, response to stress, ECM genes, migration and cell adhesion.These data show that normal astrocytes from AA and CA normal donors display distinct expression profiles that impact astrocyte functions in the ONH. Our data suggests that differences in gene expression in ONH astrocytes may be specific to the development and/or progression of glaucoma in AA."
https://openalex.org/W2026022985,"The heat shock protein [Hsp] family guides several steps during protein synthesis, are abundant in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and are highly conserved during evolution. The Hsp60 family is involved in assembly and transport of proteins, and is expressed at very high levels during autoimmunity or autoinflammatory phenomena. Here, the pathophysiological role of the wild type [WT] and the point mutated K(409)A recombinant Hsp65 of M. leprae in an animal model of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus [SLE] was evaluated in vivo using the genetically homogeneous [NZBxNZW]F(1) mice. Anti-DNA and anti-Hsp65 antibodies responsiveness was individually measured during the animal's life span, and the mean survival time [MST] was determined. The treatment with WT abbreviates the MST in 46%, when compared to non-treated mice [p<0.001]. An increase in the IgG2a/IgG1 anti-DNA antibodies ratio was also observed in animals injected with the WT Hsp65. Incubation of BALB/c macrophages with F(1) serum from WT treated mice resulted in acute cell necrosis; treatment of these cells with serum from K(409)A treated mice did not cause any toxic effect. Moreover, the involvement of WT correlates with age and is dose-dependent. Our data suggest that Hsp65 may be a central molecule intervening in the progression of the SLE, and that the point mutated K(409)A recombinant immunogenic molecule, that counteracts the deleterious effect of WT, may act mitigating and delaying the development of SLE in treated mice. This study gives new insights into the general biological role of Hsp and the significant impact of environmental factors during the pathogenesis of this autoimmune process."
