https://openalex.org/W2088148916,"degenerative and regenerative roles of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a pro-inflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic functions, were investigated by using TNF receptor 1 and 2 double knockout (TNFR-DKO) and TNF-alpha antibody neutralized mice following traumatic freeze injury to the tibialis anterior muscle. In wild-type control mice, TNF-alpha mRNA transcripts and protein increased following injury and gradually returned to control (uninjured) levels by 13 days. A reduction in MyoD mRNA expression occurred in TNF-alpha-deficient mice, although there were no visible differences in MyoD immunostaining or histological characteristics in regenerating muscles. At 5 days post-injury, the reductions in isometric strength in TNFR-DKO and TNF-alpha-depleted mice did not differ from that of wild-type mice but by 13 days after injury, the TNFR-DKO and TNF-alpha-depleted mice exhibited strength deficits twice that of wild-type mice (i.e., 27-31% vs 13%). Muscle injury was also accompanied by increased expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), but IL-6-deficient mice demonstrated MyoD expression and recovery of isometric strength similar to that of wild-type mice. These data indicate that TNF-alpha is involved in the recovery of muscle function after traumatic muscle injury, and this effect might be associated with modulation of muscle regulatory genes, including MyoD."

https://openalex.org/W2152390280,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are hormone-like agents present in the environment that alter the endocrine system of wildlife and humans. Most EDCs have potencies far below those of the natural hormone 17beta-E2 when acting through the classic estrogen receptors (ERs). Here, we show that the environmental estrogen Bisphenol-A and the native hormone 17beta-E2 activate the transcription factor, cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) with the same potency. Phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) was increased after only a 5-minute application of either BPA or 17beta-E2 in a calcium-dependent manner. The effect was reproduced by the membrane-impermeable molecule E2 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (E-HRP). The increase in P-CREB was not modified by the anti-estrogen ICI 182,780. Therefore, low-dose of BPA activates the transcription factor CREB via an alternative mechanism, involving a non-classical membrane estrogen receptor. Because these effects are elicited at concentrations as low as 10(-9) M, this observation is of environmental and public health relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2136899344,"We hypothesized that the mechanically active environment present in rotating bioreactors mediates the effectiveness of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering. Cartilaginous constructs were engineered by using bovine calf chondrocytes in conjunction with two scaffold materials (SM) (benzylated hyaluronan and polyglycolic acid); three scaffold structures (SS) (sponge, non-woven mesh, and composite woven/non-woven mesh); and two culture systems (CS) (a bioreactor system and petri dishes). Construct size, composition [cells, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), total collagen, and type-specific collagen mRNA expression and protein levels], and mechanical function (compressive modulus) were assessed, and individual and interactive effects of model system parameters (SM, SS, CS, SM*CS and SS*CS) were demonstrated. The CS affected cell seeding (higher yields of more spatially uniform cells were obtained in bioreactor-grown than dish-grown 3-day constructs) and subsequently affected chondrogenesis (higher cell numbers, wet weights, wet weight GAG fractions, and collagen type II levels were obtained in bioreactor-grown than dish-grown 1-month constructs). In bioreactors, mesh-based scaffolds yielded 1-month constructs with lower type I collagen levels and four-fold higher compressive moduli than corresponding sponge-based scaffolds. The data imply that interactions between bioreactors and 3D tissue engineering scaffolds can be utilized to improve the structure, function, and molecular properties of in vitro-generated cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W2017697398,"The mammalian polo-like kinase (Plk) plays a critical role in M-phase progression. Plk is phosphorylated and activated by an upstream kinase(s), which has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analyses of Plk labeled in vivo and phosphorylated in vitro by Xenopus polo-like kinase kinase-1 (xPlkk1) or by lymphocyte-oriented kinase, its most closely related mammalian enzyme, indicate that Thr-210 is a major phosphorylation site in activated Plk from mitotic HeLa cells. Although the amino acid sequence surrounding Ser-137 is similar to that at Thr-210 and is conserved in Plk family members, Ser-137 is not detectably phosphorylated in mitotic mammalian cells or by xPlkk1 in vitro. Nevertheless, the substitution of either Thr-210 or Ser-137 with Asp (T210D or S137D) elevates the kinase activity of Plk. The kinase activity of the double mutant S137D/T210D is not significantly different from that of T210D or S137D, demonstrating that substitution of both residues does not have an additive effect on Plk activity. Expression of the S137D mutant construct arrested HeLa cells in early S-phase with slightly separated centrosomes, whereas cells expressing wild type and T210D were arrested or delayed in M-phase. These data indicate that the Ser-137 may have an unexpected and novel role in the function of Plk. The mammalian polo-like kinase (Plk) plays a critical role in M-phase progression.

Progression through the mammalian cell cycle depends on the periodic control of various cyclin-dependent kinases (for reviews, see Refs. 1Morgan D.O.

In Xenopus, Plk may play an important role at the onset of mitosis; Xenopus Plk (Plx1) phosphorylates and activates the phosphatase Cdc25C, a positive regulator of Cdc2-cyclin B (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition to proteolytic regulation, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are also a key regulatory mechanism of protein kinases in the cell cycle. Throughout late S and early G2 phases, Cdc2 is kept inactive as the result of phosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 in the ATP-binding site. Phosphorylation at these sites is catalyzed by the protein kinases Wee1 and Myt1 (12Parker L.L. Atherton-Fessler S. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation of Cdc2-cyclin B at the G2/M transition requires dephosphorylation of both residues by Cdc25C (14Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W.

During mitosis, the phosphorylated enzyme is detected as a more slowly migrating form. Phosphatase treatment increases the mobility and reduces the activity of Plk (17Hamanaka R. Smith M.R.

Comm. 1997; 239: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The original studies on Thr-210 in Plk demonstrated that substitution of aspartate at this site significantly elevates protein kinase activity (20Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3408-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This residue is in the activation loop between protein kinase subdomains VII and VIII, and phosphorylation within this loop results in the activation of several kinases including Cdc2 and Mek1 (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 21Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These data suggest that aspartate mimics the phosphorylation of serine or threonine in the activation loop and, moreover, raise the possibility that Thr-210 is a physiologically important phosphorylation site. xPlkk1 was identified in Xenopus egg extracts and was cloned as a major upstream kinase of Plx1 (22Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Microinjection of xPlkk1 into Xenopusoocytes accelerates the time of Plx1 activation as well as the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle (23Qian Y.-W. Erikson E., Li, C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The upstream activating kinase of Plk in mammalian cells still remains to be identified, although there are enzymes closely related to xPlkk1, such as LOK (24Kuramochi S. Moriguchi T. Kuida K. Endo J. Semba K. Nishida E. Karasuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22679-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and STE20-like kinase (SLK) (25Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Karasuyama H. Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Todokoro K. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), in mammalian cells. We have shown 2Y.-J. Jang, Y. Terada, and R. L. Erikson, unpublished data. that LOK functions in vitro in a fashion similar to xPlkk1; however, as yet, there are no data that indicate it is the relevant upstream activator of Plk in vivo. However, in previous studies, the site(s) of activating phosphorylation in Plk were not identified. In this study, we provide direct evidence that Thr-210 is a major phosphorylation site in mitotic Plk and that this site is important for Plk activation. In contrast, although substitution of Ser-137, which is embedded in a similar sequence as Thr-210, with aspartate also activates Plk, this residue is not phosphorylated in vitroby xPlkk1 or in vivo in mitotic cells and does not appear to be involved in activation of Plk during mitosis. Nevertheless, experiments with Ser-137 mutants suggest that this site has the potential to have a biologically significant role in regulating Plk activity during other stages of the cell cycle. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). To synchronize cells at the G1/S transition, HeLa cells were treated with a double thymidine block (2.5 mm). To obtain mitotically synchronized cells, G1 cells, which were synchronized by treatment with mimosine (300 μm) for 16 h, were washed with fresh medium and were released into medium containing 200 ng/ml nocodazole for 18 h. To obtain metabolically labeled endogenous Plk, actively growing HeLa cells were arrested with 200 ng/ml nocodazole for 12 h. The mitotic cells were collected by shake-off and washed with labeling medium (phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% dialyzed serum, 10% normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 200 ng/ml nocodazole). Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) at a final concentration of 0.7 mCi/ml for 4 h before washing and lysis. Transfection was performed by the standard calcium chloride method (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) except that HEPES-buffered saline was used. Mutations at the indicated sites in the Plk construct were generated by PCR. All the PCR products were cloned into pGEX vector (Promega) and sequenced. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and confirmed by Western blot with anti-Plk antibody. To generate recombinant baculoviruses, the pGEX constructs were cloned into pAcGHLT vector (Pharmingen) and were transfected into Sf9 cells with BaculoGoldTM (Pharmingen). For expression in mammalian cells, all constructs were cloned into pCMV-Tag2 vector (Stratagene), which encodes eight amino acids of FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope at the N terminus. Recombinant baculoviruses for expression of His-xPlkk1 were a kind gift of James Maller. Recombinant LOK or xPlkk1 proteins were prepared from Hi5 cells untreated or treated with 0.1 μm okadaic acid for 3 h with the use of TALON affinity resin and were further purified as described previously (22Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Fractions containing xPlkk1 proteins were stored in small portions at −80 °C. Cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm p-nitro phenylphosphate, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with antibody, anti-Plk monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for metabolically labeled endogenous Plk or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for transfected Plk. Protein A/G- or protein G-PLUS Agarose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was added to isolate the immunocomplexes. Kinase reactions were carried out as described (20Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3408-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of wild type or T210D Plk on the activation of Cdc2-cyclin B, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-Plk or HA-PlkT210D. About 60% of the total cell population expressed Plk1 under these conditions. At 12 h, mimosine was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm, and cells were incubated for an additional 20 h. Cells were released from the mimosine block by washing with serum-free medium and incubated in complete medium before collection to measure Cdc2-cyclin B histone kinase activity in immunocomplex assays. Cell extracts were incubated with polyclonal anti-Cdc2 antibody, and immunocomplex assays were performed as described previously (20Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3408-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Histone H1 phosphorylation was measured with a Fujix BAS 2000 phosphorimaging device and MacBAS v2.5 software. The radiolabeled proteins were electrophoresed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel (1:120 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). For phosphopeptide mapping, the pertinent region of the membrane was blocked with 1 ml of blocking solution (0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mmacetic acid) for 30 min at 37 °C. The membrane pieces were washed with HPLC-grade water and with freshly made 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated in 200–300 μl of 50 mmammonium bicarbonate containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 20 μg of α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C overnight. The supernatant was dried, dissolved in 100 μl of HPLC-grade water, and dried again. This washing step was repeated three times. The final dried samples were spotted onto a TLC plate (5716-7, EM Science). Electrophoresis in the first dimension was performed at 1000 V for 30 min in 1% ammonium carbonate containing 0.5 mm EDTA with the HTLE-7000 system (C.B.S. Scientific). The second dimension was developed for 10–12 h with n-butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:water (375:250:75:300). For phosphoamino acid analysis, the phosphopeptides hydrolyzed in 6n HCl were spotted and analyzed by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the first dimension (1.5 V for 20 min) and pH 3.5 in the second dimension (1.3 V for 16 min) with the HTLE-7000 system (27Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Cells co-transfected with Plk constructs and GFP vector (pEGFP-F, Clontech) were detached from the plates by trypsinization. After fixation in 80% ice-cold ethanol at 4 °C for 16 h, cells were stained in PBS supplemented with 15 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at room temperature. Bivariate measurements of green (GFP) and red (propidium iodide-DNA) fluorescence were made with FACScanTM (BD Biosciences). A gate was set to select GFP-positive cells with a green fluorescent signal at least 40 times stronger than negative cells. Data were collected for more than 30,000 events with the FL1 signal (GFP) and analyzed using Cell QuestTM (BD Biosciences) and ModFitTM 2.0 (Verity Software House) (28Jiang W. Hunter T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 348-354Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Pestov D.G. Polonskaia M. Lau L.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For fluorescence microscopy, HeLa cells were seeded onto coverslips and were transfected as described previously. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS followed by treatment with ice-cold methanol. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 2 h in PBS supplemented with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml). The mounted coverslips were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, and the visualized cells were captured on the LSM510 imaging system (Zeiss). To analyze the modification and activation of Plk during the cell cycle, HeLa cells were synchronized in G1/S phase with mimosine and transferred into fresh medium with nocodazole to allow entry into M phase. Cells were harvested at various times and analyzed by immunoblotting. Plk from cells arrested in G1/S phase migrated as a single band (Fig.1 A, lane 1). The slower migrating phosphorylated form of Plk increased as cells proceeded into M phase and was maximal at prometaphase (lane 8). To compare the kinase activity of Plk at various stages, endogenous Plk was immunoprecipitated with anti-Plk antibody from lysates of G1/S phase and prometaphase cells, and the phosphorylation of casein was assessed. The results shown in Fig.1 B confirm previous studies that Plk activity from mitotic cells is severalfold greater than that from G1/S cells (17Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,19Mundt K.E. Golsteyn R.M. Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 239: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Further assessment of Plk phosphorylation and kinase activity was performed inin vitro kinase assays. His6-xPlkk1, which has been characterized as a Plx1-activating kinase in Xenopus(22Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was purified from insect cells and used to phosphorylate mammalian Plk. GST-tagged kinase-defective Plk (K82M), which lacks autophosphorylation activity (Fig.2 A, lane 1), was phosphorylated by xPlkk1 (lane 3). When GST-Plk wild type (WT) was incubated and phosphorylated by purified xPlkk1 or LOK, catalytic activity was elevated severalfold (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). xPlkk1 did not show detectable phosphorylation of casein. These results demonstrate that xPlkk1 can phosphorylate and activate mammalian Plk in vitro. Similar results have also been obtained using purified LOK, a mammalian enzyme closely related in sequence to xPlkk1 (data not shown). As shown for xPlkk1, purified wild type Plk has significant autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 2 A,lane 4). To investigate whether the phosphorylation by an upstream kinase and autophosphorylation occur on a common residue, phosphopeptide maps of both GST-Plk K82M phosphorylated by xPlkk1 and autophosphorylated GST-PlkWT were compared. Although the chymotryptic digest of phosphorylated K82M yielded 5–6 phosphopeptides (Fig. 2 C, panel a), that of autophosphorylated Plk yielded several phosphopeptides that did not migrate with those of phosphorylated K82M (panels b and c). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the site(s) phosphorylated by xPlkk1 is mainly threonine (Fig. 2 D, panel 1), whereas the autophosphorylated site(s) occur primarily on serine (panel 2). These data indicate that phosphorylation by an upstream kinase and autophosphorylation in Plk occur on different residues and that phosphorylation on threonine is likely to be important for Plk activation. To characterize Plk phosphorylation during mitosis, HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate during treatment with nocodazole as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Endogenous Plk was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and radiolabel incorporated into Plk was detected by autoradiography (Fig. 3 A,lane 1). In parallel, the proteins from the immunocomplex and the cell lysate were monitored by Western blot with anti-Plk antibody (lanes 2 and 3). Approximately one-third of endogenous Plk from nocodazole-treated cells displayed retarded electrophoretic mobility. Radiolabel was detected solely in this slower migrating form (filled arrowhead), indicating that this form corresponds to Plk phosphorylated during mitosis in HeLa cells. To investigate whether in vivo and in vitrophosphorylation occurs on the same residue, the phosphopeptide map of Plk labeled in vivo was compared with that of kinase-defective Plk phosphorylated in vitro. The labeled protein from the membranes (Fig. 2 A, lane 3 forin vitro labeled Plk and Fig. 3 A, lane 1 for in vivo labeled Plk) was excised and subjected to phosphopeptide mapping. From Plk labeled in vivo, two major phosphopeptides were detected; these were in exactly the same positions as those on the phosphopeptide map of Plk phosphorylated in vitro (Fig. 3 B, panels a–c). Phosphoamino acid analyses on individual spots (panel a,spots 1–6) showed that the major phosphopeptides (spots 1 and 2) contain phosphothreonine (Fig.3 C, panel 1). The two spots (Fig. 3 B,panel b), which are coincident with the major phosphopeptides in panel a, also yielded phosphothreonine (Fig. 3 C, panel 2), indicating that same threonine residue(s) may be phosphorylated in vitro andin vivo. Two other phosphopeptides (spots 4 and6) also yielded phosphothreonine, whereas the remaining peptides (spots 3 and 5) yielded phosphoserine (data not shown), which is consistent with the phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 2 D). There are several conserved serine and threonine residues in the N-terminal catalytic domain of Plks (20Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3408-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The replacement of Thr-210 with Asp elevates the kinase activity of Plk produced in Sf9 cells and in budding yeast (20Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3408-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, Thr-201 (corresponding to Thr-210 in mammalian Plk) is required for activation of Plx1 (30Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results do not, however, provide direct evidence that Thr-210 is a phosphorylation site in mammalian Plk. To investigate whether the phosphothreonine residue in Plk labeledin vitro and in vivo is indeed Thr-210, we generated a mutant in which Thr-210 is substituted with Asp in the kinase-defective background (KMTD). After phosphorylation in vitro with xPlkk1, the phosphopeptide map of KMTD was compared with that of the K82M mutant. All threonine-containing peptides, which were detected in the map of K82M mutant (Fig.4 a, spots 1,2, 4, and 6), were undetectable in the map of the KMTD mutant (Fig. 4 b), indicating that xPlkk1 phosphorylates Thr-210. We propose that the four threonine-containing peptides result from partial digestion, which is likely as the recovery of the minor phosphopeptides is not as reproducible as spots 1 and 2. The chymotryptic map of KMSD, in which Ser-137 was substituted with Asp, yielded the two phosphoserine-containing peptides present in the map of the K m mutant (Fig. 4 c,spots 3 and 5). This indicates that, although the sequences surrounding Ser-137 and Thr-210 are similar, this residue is apparently not phosphorylated in vivo or in vitroby xPlkk1. The phosphopeptides that contain Thr-210 (spots 1and 2) were present on the map of the KMSD mutant (Fig. 4,a and c) but at a lower level. To investigate whether mutation of Thr-210 or Ser-137 affects the catalytic activity of Plk, we created FLAG-tagged mutants, and the kinase activities of these mutants, expressed in and immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells, were determined. When Thr-210 or Ser-137 was substituted with Asp (TD or SD), Plk displayed increased activity (Fig. 5, A andB, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, mutation of Thr-210 to Val (TV) abolished its activity (lane 5). Mutation of Ser-137 to Ala (SA) did not change its activity significantly from that of wild type Plk (lane 3). Plk, in which both Ser-137 and Thr-210 were substituted with Asp (SDTD), was not more active than Plk with a TD mutation (lane 8), indicating that substitution of both Ser-137 and Thr-210 with Asp does not have an additive effect on the activity of Plk. This result is in contrast with that found with Plx1, in which the homologous mutations are additive (30Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We transfected the various mutant constructs into HeLa cells for 40 h and analyzed both the DNA content by FACS and the morphological changes by fluorescence microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures” to evaluate the phenotypic changes elicited. The G2/M population of HeLa cells transfected with wild type and Thr-210 mutant constructs increased slightly (Fig.5 C, panels 3, 6, and 7). The cells expressing the kinase-defective mutant showed a similar phenotype as the wild type and Thr-210 mutants, which accumulated in M-phase (Figs. 5 C, panel 2, and6 A, panels 2,3, 6, and 7) in agreement with a previous report (19Mundt K.E. Golsteyn R.M. Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 239: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This suggests that ectopic expression of Plk does not affect the G2/M transition but does disturb mitotic progression. However, when the S137D mutant, which has catalytic activity similar to that of T210D, was expressed, more than 90% of the transfected cells showed G1/S DNA content (Fig. 5,A and B, lanes 4 and 6, and Figs. 5 C and 6 A, panel 5). The double mutant, S137D/T210D, resulted in accumulation of a G1/S population as well (Figs. 5 C, panel 9, and6 A, panel 8), indicating that the block caused by S137D is not abrogated by T210D. Cells were then transfected with the GFP-S137D fusion construct. GFP-S137D localized to centrosomes (Fig.6 B), as shown by staining with anti-γ-tubulin antibody; the GFP and γ-tubulin signals, which colocalize, appeared as two slightly separated dots. To determine whether Plk T210D accelerates entry into G2/M, HeLa cells were transfected with vector, wild type, or T210D constructs for protein expression and subsequently blocked at G1/S 12 h post-transfection with mimosine. After incubation for an additional 20 h, the cells were released from the mimosine block, and the activity of Cdc2-cyclin B was measured in immunocomplexes using histone as a substrate. The timing and degree of Cdc2-cyclin B activity were not changed as the result of Plk expression, and cells expressing each construct appeared to enter G2/M normally (Fig.7). It should be noted that about 60% of the cells is transfected in this type of experiment and that Cdc2-cyclin B activity is measured on the entire population. In experiments using Xenopus egg extracts, the addition of Plx T201D, which is homologous to Plk T210D, accelerates Cdc2-cyclin B activation by about 30 min as compared with wild type Plx1 or endogenous enzyme (30Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Xenopus extracts are very homogenous as compared with transfected cells, and the difficulty in achieving a high degree of synchrony in an animal cell population makes it difficult to detect minor shifts in activation. In this study, we have demonstrated that Thr-210 is the majorin vivo phosphorylation site of activated mammalian Plk during M phase. Plk labeled with 32P during M phase shows two major phosphopeptides after chymotryptic cleavage (Fig.3 B, panel b), both of which contain threonine, and several minor phosphopeptides. The two major phosphopeptides comigrate with phosphopeptides obtained after in vitrophosphorylation of kinase-dead (K82M) Plk with xPlkk1. In contrast, these phosphopeptides are absent after in vitrophosphorylation of kinase-defective Plk K82M/T210D double mutant (Fig.4, panel b). Several other phosphopeptides are generated by xPlkk1 under these in vitro conditions, but they are undetectable in endogenous Plk after in vivo metabolic labeling with radioactive phosphate. We conclude, therefore, that they are not essential for activation of Plk in vivo. Thr-210 does not appear to be a major in vitro autophosphorylation site; in this case, serine phosphopeptides are detected. However, activated M phase Plk that has been metabolically labeled does not contain major phosphoserine-containing peptides, suggesting that autophosphorylation is not a significant event during activation of Plk during M phase. Ser-137 in mammalian Plk is preceded by three basic amino acids and followed by a hydrophobic residue (134RRRSL), similar to the Thr-210 site (207RKKTL). Conversion of the homologous residue to aspartate in Plx1 activates the enzyme (30Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be a physiologically relevant phosphorylation site. Mutation of Ser-137 to Asp-137 in mammalian Plk also results in increased kinase activity (Fig. 5, A and B); however, in contrast to Plx1, Plk with both Ser-137 and Thr-210 converted to aspartate is not further activated (30Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8625-8632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we show here that Ser-137 is not phosphorylated in vitro by xPlkk1 (Fig. 4, panel c), nor is it apparently phosphorylated in M phase cells. We have not resolved, however, whether or not Ser-137 is phosphorylated at another point in the cell cycle prior to M phase. We have also used LOK, the mammalian enzyme closely related xPlkk1, to phosphorylate and activate Plk in vitro with essentially the same results shown here for xPlkk1. Our studies to date, however, do not implicate LOK as the upstream activating enzyme of Plk in vivo.2 To determine whether modification of Ser-137 has the potential to influence the cell cycle, S137D Plk was expressed in HeLa cells, and its influence on the cell cycle was examined. As shown in Fig.5 B, cells expressing S137D had the novel and unexpected phenotype showing a G1 DNA content, in contrast to all other Plk mutants, in which expression resulted in a high percentage of cells with a G2 DNA content. Images of cells expressing Plk S137D show that they remain flat and well attached with condensed DNA in the nucleus. Moreover, GFP-S137D localized to centrosomes, which were separated slightly (Fig. 6 B) and were similar to those of cells arrested in late G1 phase by treatment with mimosine (data not shown). These data suggest that Ser-137 modification prior to M phase may be of physiological significance in the cell cycle and that another polo-like kinase kinase may be active at that point. Because of the lack of suitable synchronized cell populations, it has not yet been possible to determine whether Plk is phosphorylated on Ser-137 at other points in the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of all other Plk constructs, including wild type, appear to result in cells blocked in mitosis or cytokinesis. We believe this is likely to be the result of the capacity of the C terminus of Plk to act as a dominant negative, which causes this phenotype after the deletion of the kinase domain (31Jang Y.-J.

However, if HeLa cells are blocked at G1/S with mimosine shortly after transfection, expression of Plk1 does not appear to alter the timing of Cdc2-cyclin B activation. This result is consistent with the observation that Cdc2-cyclin B is apparently activated normally in cells depleted of Plk with small interference RNA (siRNA) (33Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8672-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This report provides direct evidence that Thr-210 is a site for an activating phosphorylation event in vitro and the major phosphorylation site in vivo as well. In addition, we show that Ser-137 is not phosphorylated in M phase. The discovery that Plk S137D influences cell cycle progression in a unique fashion suggests new approaches for the study of the polo-like kinase family. While this manuscript was under review, Kelm et al. (34Kelm O. Wind M. Lehmann W.D. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25247-25256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) published studies on the phosphorylation of Plx1. They reported that phosphorylation of Thr-201 is an activating event in vivo, in agreement with the results presented here. They found, however, that although xPlkk1 does phosphorylate Plx1, this phosphorylation does not activate Plx1 and does not occur on Thr-201. The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear. We thank Eleanor Erikson for helpful discussion and critical reading of this manuscript."

In this study, we performed calibrated measurements of mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, ΔpH, and intramitochondrial [K+] in digitonin-permeabilized PC12 and GT1-7 neural cells that either do not express human Bcl-2 (control transfectants) or that were transfected with and overexpressed the human bcl-2gene to evaluate whether Bcl-2 alters mitochondrial inner membrane ion transport. We found that although Bcl-2-overexpressing cells exhibit higher fluorescence responses to membrane potential, pH, and K+-sensitive dyes, this increased response is due to an enhanced accumulation of these dyes and not an increased mitochondrial membrane potential, ΔpH, or [K+]. This result is supported by the presence of equal respiratory rates in Bcl-2+ and Bcl-2− cells. Possible structural alterations in Bcl-2+ mitochondria that could account for increases in fluorescent dye uptake were evaluated using flow cytometry particle sizing and light scattering determinations.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar), and acts to inhibit mitochondrially controlled steps leading to cell death. The effects of Bcl-2 on mitochondrial control of cell death are variable according to the experimental conditions studied, indicating a multifunctional role for this protein. For example, Bcl-2 inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition (8Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 9Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Funahashi Y. Mignon A. Lacronique V. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a process often associated with mitochondrial cytochrome c release and subsequent cell death (8Zamzami N. Susin S.A.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), and Bcl-2 is also capable of inhibiting cytochrome c release pathways independent of mitochondrial permeability transition, such as Bid- and Bax-mediated cytochrome c release (12Polster B.M. Kinnally K.W. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37887-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 effects on mitochondria determined to date involve almost exclusively studies conducted under conditions leading to cell death. Although these studies are essential to understand the antiapoptotic effects of this protein, it is important to determine whether Bcl-2 can affect mitochondrial function under basal conditions. Understanding the changes promoted by Bcl-2 on mitochondrial function in healthy cells may determine how these cells respond to potentially deadly stimuli and uncover the common roots of the distinct antiapoptotic effects of this protein. Furthermore, Bcl-2 may have an unknown role in the regulation of basal mitochondrial energy metabolism. In fact, some previous data from both our group and others (9Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Funahashi Y. Mignon A. Lacronique V. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 10Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) suggest that Bcl-2 may regulate mitochondrial proton transport across the inner membrane resulting in higher mitochondrial membrane potentials since Bcl-2-overexpressing mitochondria take up larger quantities of membrane potential-sensitive dyes. This increased mitochondrial membrane potential could explain other Bcl-2 effects such as increased H2O2 generation (14Esposti M.D. Hatzinisiriou I. McLennan H. Ralph S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29831-29837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Steinman H.M. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1263-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) since mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation is strongly inhibited at lower membrane potentials (17Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the cause of these mitochondrial changes promoted by Bcl-2 has never been carefully studied, and these results are often obtained from a single transfected cell line, raising the possibility that these are not universal Bcl-2 effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of Bcl-2 on mitochondrial function and structure using two separate cell lines and found that overexpression of this protein does not affect the membrane potential, respiration, ΔpH, or intramitochondrial [K+] but does increase mitochondrial volume and structural complexity. This increase in volume and structural complexity explains changes in fluorimetric membrane potential determinations conducted previously. Based on our results, we propose a model in which enhanced mitochondrial volume and structural complexity mediate many of the Bcl-2 effects related to the prevention of cell death. PC12 pheochromocytoma and immortalized hypothalamic GT1-7 neuronal cell lines transfected with the humanbcl-2 gene (Bcl-2+) or with a control retroviral construct (Bcl-2−) were maintained as described previously (4Kane D.J.

Prior to the experiments the cells were trypsinized and suspended in growth medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. Suspended cells were kept at room temperature for up to 5 h. Cell viability, as assessed by a cell count in trypan blue, was above 95% even after 5 h at room temperature. The suspended cells were centrifuged and resuspended in the medium used in the experiment just prior to each determination. Cell protein content was determined using the Biuret method. All experiments were conducted at 37 °C. Mitochondrial ΔΨ1 was estimated through fluorescence changes of safranin O (5 mm) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 586 nm, respectively (10Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 18Fiskum G. Kowaltowski A.J. Andreyev A.Y. Kushnareva Y.E. Starkov A.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 222-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were calibrated using a K+ gradient as described by Akerman and Wikstrom (19Akerman K.E. Wikstrom M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), and the membrane potential obtained for each K+ concentration was determined using the Nernst equation assuming intramitochondrial [K+] to be 150 mm, a value quite close to the experimentally determined [K+] in GT1-7 cells (see Fig. 3). A calibration curve was constructed and fitted using Origin® software, and all subsequent fluorescence traces were transformed into ΔΨ using the same fitting equation. Cells (10 mg/ml) were suspended in medium containing 10 μm BCECF-AM, 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm pyruvate, 5 mm malate, 5 mm glutamate, 100 μm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.001% or 0.004% digitonin (GT1-7 and PC12 cells, respectively), and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 (KOH) and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The permeabilized cells with BCECF-loaded mitochondria were then diluted to 2 mg/ml in 4 °C buffer devoid of BCECF, centrifuged, and resuspended in the same medium. BCECF fluorescence emission was measured at 550 nm with variable excitation wavelengths. Intramitochondrial pH was calculated from the ratio between fluorescence levels at 509 and 450 nm as described by Molecular Probes and Jung et al. (20Jung D.W. Apel L. Brierley G.P.

Cells were treated with CCCP and nigericin (1 μm), and the extracellular medium pH (measured using a standard pH meter) was manipulated between 7 and 8 by adding HCl and KOH. A plot relating the measured pH to the 509/450 nm fluorescence ratio was used to determine intramitochondrial pH in the absence of ionophores. All experiments were conducted within 30 min of mitochondrial loading with BCECF. Cells (10 mg/ml) were suspended in medium containing 20 μm PBFI-AM (a K+ indicator marketed by Molecular Probes) and treated in the same manner as those loaded with BCECF. PBFI fluorescence emission was measured at 500 nm with variable excitation wavelengths. Intramitochondrial [K+] was calculated from the ration between fluorescence levels at 320 and 360 nm as described by Molecular Probes and Jung et al. (20Jung D.W. Apel L. Brierley G.P.

Cells were treated with CCCP and nigericin (1 μm), and spectra were collected in the presence of varying medium [K+] (50–200 mm). A plot relating [K+] to the fluorescence ratio was used to determine intramitochondrial [K+] in the absence of ionophores. Mitochondria were isolated from digitonin-permeabilized GT1-7 and PC12 cells exactly as described by Moreadith and Fiskum (22Moreadith R.W. Fiskum G. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in isolation buffer containing 210 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm Hepes, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2 (KOH). Isolated mitochondria (∼0.2 mg/ml) were incubated in 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 100 μm EGTA, pH 7.2 (KOH), containing 1 μm rotenone and 5 mmK+ succinate. The suspension was analyzed by a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and detected with a 488 nm laser. Particle size (forward scattering (FSC)) and light scattering (side scattering (SSC)) characteristics were analyzed using CellQuest software. BCECF-AM and PBFI-AM were purchased from Molecular Probes. Safranin O, EGTA, digitonin, malate, glutamate, pyruvate, bovine serum albumin, CCCP, nigericin, and valinomycin were from Sigma. Data presented as traces are representative of at least three similar repetitions. Averages represented in bar graphs were calculated from data collected in at least three repetitions using different cell preparations. Error bars indicate standard errors (S.E.), and significant differences were calculated using pairwise Tukey tests conducted by SigmaStat®. Previous studies have shown that Bcl-2 overexpression causes an increase in the uptake of fluorescent dyes sensitive to the mitochondrial ΔΨ, a result interpreted as an increase in ΔΨ induced by this protein (9Shimizu S.

This ΔΨ effect could explain many changes observed in Bcl-2-overexpressing mitochondria, including increased reactive oxygen species generation (14Esposti M.D. Hatzinisiriou I. McLennan H. Ralph S.

To understand the mechanism through which Bcl-2 apparently enhances ΔΨ, we performed measurements of mitochondrial uptake of the ΔΨ-sensitive probe safranin O and calibrated the data by using K+ gradients and applying the Nernst equation (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 19Akerman K.E. Wikstrom M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted using cultured cells in which low digitonin concentrations were added to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane, promoting a large dilution of cytosolic components while maintaining cell architecture and mitochondrial function unaltered (18Fiskum G. Kowaltowski A.J. Andreyev A.Y. Kushnareva Y.E. Starkov A.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 222-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is the preferred method to study the effects of Bcl-2 in mitochondria from transfected cell lines since mitochondrial isolation may promote damage to the organelle in a Bcl-2-inhibited manner (18Fiskum G. Kowaltowski A.J. Andreyev A.Y. Kushnareva Y.E. Starkov A.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 222-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As noted previously (9Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Funahashi Y.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), PC12 pheochromocytoma cells overexpressing human Bcl-2 (Bcl-2+ cells) decrease safranin fluorescence more intensely than control transfectant cells (Bcl-2-) and present an enhanced difference in fluorescence in the presence and absence of the proton ionophore CCCP (ΔFluorescence) when respiring on NADH-linked substrates (Fig. 1, upper andlower left), an effect compatible with a higher ΔΨ. A similar increase in safranin ΔFluorescence was observed in a second transfected cell line (GT1-7 hypothalamic tumor cells; Fig. 1,lower left). However, when we calibrated ΔΨ using a K+ distribution curve (Fig. 1, upper panels, see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 19Akerman K.E. Wikstrom M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), we found that Bcl-2+ mitochondria presented larger safranin responses to equal ΔΨ changes (more change in fluorescence with equal K+additions). By using the best fittings for the fluorescenceversus ΔΨ plots (Fig. 1, upper right), we were able to estimate Bcl-2− and Bcl-2+ ΔΨ in the absence of added K+ and found these to be equal in both cell lines studied (Fig. 1, lower left). Thus, Bcl-2 increases safranin fluorescence changes dependent on ΔΨ, but this effect seems to be related to an altered calibration curve and not enhanced ΔΨ. We also determined mitochondrial respiratory rates in Bcl-2+ and Bcl-2− cells (Fig. 1, lower right) and plotted them against the measured membrane potential in the presence of increasing K+ and CCCP concentrations. A change in the linear ΔΨ/respiration plot would be indicative of altered proton pumping/oxygen consumption ratios at the mitochondrial respiratory chain as proposed previously to explain the apparent higher ΔΨ in Bcl-2+ mitochondria (9Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Funahashi Y. Mignon A. Lacronique V. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We found that Bcl-2 does not change the correlation between mitochondrial oxygen consumption and H+pumping, a result which supports the finding that mitochondrial ΔΨ is equal in Bcl-2+ and Bcl-2− cells. Safranin is a lipophilic cation that accumulates within or in near proximity to the mitochondrial inner membrane, reducing the fluorescence of the suspension in a manner proportional to the negative charge of the mitochondrial matrix (19Akerman K.E. Wikstrom M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Thus, safranin fluorescence traces measure only changes in charge across the inner membrane and are insensitive to a second component of the mitochondrial H+gradient, ΔpH. In addition, the estimated ΔΨ calculated using the Nernst equation in Fig. 1 assumes intramitochondrial K+concentrations to be ∼150 mm and equal in Bcl-2+ and Bcl-2− cells. To ascertain that Bcl-2 affects safranin distribution and not the mitochondrial proton gradient, we measured both ΔpH and K+ concentrations in Bcl-2+ and Bcl-2− mitochondria. The experiments shown in Fig. 2 compare ΔpH levels in Bcl-2− and Bcl-2+ mitochondria. We found that the addition of nigericin, a K+/H+ exchanger that reduces ΔpH and increases ΔΨ, promotes very similar effects on ΔΨ measured by calibrated safranin fluorescence in Bcl-2− and Bcl-2+ mitochondria (Fig. 2, upper panels). To confirm that Bcl-2 did not affect ΔpH, we loaded GT1-7 mitochondria with the esterified form of the pH-sensitive dye BCECF. PC12 mitochondria were not used in this experiment since they loaded very poorly with this dye, and the final fluorescence levels were insufficient to accurately estimate ΔpH. In GT1-7 Bcl-2+ cells, BCECF fluorescence was more intense and responded more significantly to the addition of nigericin than that in Bcl-2− cells (Fig. 2, bottom left). However, by calibrating the fluorescence traces (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found no difference in intramitochondrial pH levels in Bcl-2− and Bcl-2+ mitochondria despite a consistently higher BCECF load (Fig. 2, bottom right). These results indicated that, although GT1-7 mitochondria are more intensely loaded with BCECF, there is no difference in ΔpH between Bcl-2− and Bcl-2+ mitochondria. Intramitochondrial K+ levels were determined in Fig.3 by loading mitochondria with the K+ probe PBFI-AM. Again PC12 cells loaded very poorly with the dye, so only GT1-7 cells were used. We found that, although Bcl-2+ mitochondria loaded more dye and presented more intense fluorescence (Fig. 3, upper panels and lower right), no difference in intramitochondrial K+ concentrations could be detected when the data were calibrated (lower left). Indeed, intramitochondrial K+ concentrations determined using PBFI were quite close to the estimated K+ concentrations used to calibrate ΔΨ determinations in Figs. 1 and 2, ensuring the accuracy of our ΔΨ estimation. In the absence of any difference in ΔΨ, ΔpH, or intramitochondrial [K+], the increased fluorescence response to three different dyes observed in the Bcl-2+ mitochondria suggests the presence of a larger mitochondrial membrane surface (to increase safranin distribution since safranin accumulates in close contact to or within the inner membrane, Ref. 19Akerman K.E. Wikstrom M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and matrix volume (to increase intramitochondrial BCECF and PBFI accumulation). To investigate this surprising possibility, we isolated mitochondria from GT1-7 and PC12 Bcl-2− and Bcl-2+ cells and evaluated their size and structural complexity using flow cytometry (Fig.4). FSC measurements using a flow cytometer can be used to estimate particle size since the intensity of light scattered at small angles from an incident laser beam is proportional to particle volume as demonstrated by Mullaney et al. (24Mullaney P.F. Van Dilla M.A. Coulter J.R. Dean P.N. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1969; 40: 1029-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the top panels of Fig. 4, we compared FSC in Bcl-2− and Bcl-2+ mitochondria isolated from GT1-7 cells. We found that Bcl-2+ mitochondria present two populations of distinct sizes and that the average particle size of these mitochondria is larger than Bcl-2− mitochondria (Fig. 4, top left). In addition, flow cytometry can determine mitochondrial structural complexity as measured by particle light scattering (SSC), which is dependent on the refractive index of each particle. Side scattering measurements show that GT1-7 Bcl-2+ mitochondria present increased structural complexity in relation to Bcl-2− mitochondria (Fig. 4, top right). In PC12 cells, mitochondrial volume and complexity increases in Bcl-2+ cells were less pronounced but still evident (Fig. 4, lower panels). The increase in both mitochondrial size and complexity, as determined by increases in forward and side scattering, excludes the possibility that the difference between Bcl-2+ and Bcl-2− mitochondria is due to membrane damage promoted by mitochondrial isolation since mitochondria with more permeable membranes present increased size and decreased light scattering (25Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13434-13441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in two distinct cell lines, Bcl-2 overexpression enhanced the mean size and complexity of mitochondria. The enhanced size and structural complexity of Bcl-2+ mitochondria explain why these organelles present larger responses to fluorescent dyes without changes in the mitochondrial function these dyes measure. In this study, we examined the effects of Bcl-2 overexpression on mitochondrial energetics and structure using two unrelatedbcl-2-transfected cell lines. We found that Bcl-2+ mitochondria, previously thought to present higher ΔΨ due to increased uptake of membrane potential probes such as safranin and rhodamine 123 (9Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Funahashi Y. Mignon A. Lacronique V. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 10Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), do not show any difference in ΔΨ when this measurement is calibrated using K+ gradients (Fig. 1). Instead Bcl-2+ mitochondria present a larger ability to promote fluorescence changes not only of the membrane potential probe safranin but also of pH- and K+-sensitive probes BCECF and PBFI (Figs. 2 and 3) without apparent changes in ΔΨ, ΔpH, or intramitochondrial [K+]. This finding indicates that studies comparing non-calibrated fluorescence responses in cell lines with different Bcl-2 expression levels may, in fact, misinterpret fluorescence signals and should be carefully reevaluated. Previous studies involving isolated mitochondria suggest that the increase in response promoted by Bcl-2 in fluorescence ΔΨ measurements is not due to a larger number of mitochondria in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells (26Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), a result supported by the fact that no difference in respiratory activity can be measured between Bcl-2+ and Bcl-2− cells (Fig. 1, lower left). This observation suggests that Bcl-2+ mitochondria present both a more extensive membrane surface, interacting more intensely with membrane-accumulated probes such as safranin, and larger matrix volumes to enhance the accumulation of intramitochondrial probes such as BCECF and PBFI. These differences in mitochondrial volume and membrane content were confirmed by using a flow cytometer to measure particle size (forward scattering) and structural complexity (side scattering) of isolated Bcl-2+ and Bcl-2− mitochondria (Fig. 4). The exact nature of the structural changes present in Bcl-2+ mitochondria is still not clear and will have to be investigated using three-dimensional imaging techniques since conventional electron microscopy does not show any striking differences between Bcl-2− and Bcl-2+ mitochondrial morphology (10Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Independently of the exact nature of the structural alterations promoted by Bcl-2, our data using both fluorescent dyes and light scattering of individual mitochondria through flow cytometry clearly indicate that Bcl-2+ mitochondria are larger. The presence of larger mitochondria and, most probably, larger matrix volumes may explain why Bcl-2-overexpressing mitochondria have been previously found to present a larger capacity to accumulate Ca2+ ions (Ref. 26Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E. Cortopassi G. Wang E. Fiskum G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, and see the scheme in Fig. 5) independently of their increased resistance to undergo non-selective inner membrane permeabilization following excessive Ca2+ uptake (mitochondrial permeability transition, Refs. 10Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar and 11Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Vercesi A.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the increased structural complexity of Bcl-2+ mitochondria is related to changes in membrane structure such as increases in cristal folds, resulting in resistance to cytochrome c loss under conditions in which the outer membrane is permeabilized (27Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome c normally interacts closely with the inner membrane and must be displaced to the intermembrane space to be released into the cytosol (28Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Finally, larger matrix volumes may explain why Bcl-2+ cells present higher quantities of matrix-soluble components such as NADPH, NADH, and glutathione (10Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Esposti M.D. Hatzinisiriou I. McLennan H. Ralph S. J. Biol.

The antioxidant effects of NADPH and GSH are related to the increased resistance Bcl-2+ cells present to oxidative damage (10Kowaltowski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Esposti M.D. Hatzinisiriou I. McLennan H. Ralph S. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In summary, we found that Bcl-2 does not affect mitochondrial ΔΨ, ΔpH, or intramitochondrial K+ concentrations but alters mitochondrial structure, resulting in increased size and complexity. These changes are accompanied by an enhancement in the response to fluorescent dyes, including those that measure mitochondrial ΔΨ. Enhanced volume and structural complexity may affect the response presented by Bcl-2+ cells to normally deadly stimuli, inhibiting apoptosis and necrosis by preventing cytochrome crelease, increasing Ca2+ uptake capacity, and enhancing antioxidant defenses (see Fig. 5 for a proposed model).

Here we report that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPH1, which contains both a band 4.1 domain and a single PDZ domain, can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of TACE. The interaction was initially observed in a yeast two-hybrid screen and was confirmed using an in vitro binding assay and co-immunoprecipitations from eukaryotic cell extracts. The interaction is mediated via binding of the PDZ domain of PTPH1 to the COOH terminus of TACE. The latter represents a novel group I PDZ binding sequence characterized by a terminal cysteine residue. In co-expression experiments, significantly lower levels of TACE were observed in the presence of catalytically active forms of PTPH1 compared with catalytically inactive forms of PTPH1. Furthermore, phorbol ester-stimulated shedding of the TACE substrate tumor necrosis factor-α was decreased in cells expressing catalytically active PTPH1 compared with inactive PTPH1. Taken together, these results suggest that PTPH1 may be a negative regulator of TACE levels and function, and thus provide the first evidence for the regulation of TACE through a cytoplasmic protein.

In contrast, the cytoplasmic domains of TACE, KUZ, and ADAM9 contain potential signaling motifs. Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) has been shown to directly bind to and phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM9, which also becomes phosphorylated when cells are treated with phorbol esters (19Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 35Roghani M.

Overexpression of an active form of PKCδ leads to increased HB-EGF shedding, possibly by activating ADAM9 (21Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat.

Furthermore, truncated forms of TACE, KUZ, and ADAM9 lacking their pro- and metalloprotease domains appear to act in a dominant negative fashion (15Pan D. Rubin J.

In addition to identifying MAD2 as a TACE binding partner (38Nelson K.K. Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we report here that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPH1 binds to the TACE cytoplasmic domain. The basis of this interaction and the potential role of PTPH1 in modulating TACE function are examined and discussed.DISCUSSIONTACE is a prototypical protein ectodomain sheddase that has important roles in development and in the ectodomain release of proteins such as the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, the amyloid precursor protein, and ligands of the EGF receptor. The release of TACE substrates such as TNF-α from the plasma membrane can be stimulated, for example by activators of protein kinase C or by inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domain of TACE contains several potential signaling motifs, including proline-rich Src homology 3 binding sites, suggesting that the function of TACE might be controlled through an interaction with cytoplasmic proteins. Here we report that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPH1 can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of TACE, and demonstrate that PTPH1 may have a role in regulating the function of TACE.PTPH1 is a member of a family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases characterized by the presence of an amino-terminal band 4.1 domain or ERM domain, a carboxyl-terminal phosphatase domain, and an intervening region containing one or more PDZ domains (43Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 44Arimura Y. Hinoda Y. Itoh F. Takekawa M. Tsujisaki M. Adachi M. Imai K. Yachi A.

Cancer. 1993; 55: 947-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PTPH1 expression has been observed in bone marrow, fetal liver, lymph nodes, and T cells (46Gjorloff-Wingren A. Saxena M. Han S. Wang X. Alonso A. Renedo M., Oh, P. Williams S. Schnitzer J. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, PTPH1 is localized in the cytoplasm as well as in thin membrane projections on the cell surface. PTPH1 was first identified as a potential TACE-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and the interaction was confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo binding assays. In COS-7 cells, PTPH1 binds to both transfected mouse TACE and to the intrinsic monkey TACE. The interaction between TACE and PTPH1 is mediated through an interaction between the PDZ domain of PTPH1 and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ ligand domain in TACE (the carboxyl-terminal sequence KETEC). The presence of a threonine residue at the −2 position in the PDZ ligand domain of TACE is a common characteristic of ligands of group I PDZ domains (42Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). However, although the majority of group I PDZ domains contain V/I/L/M in the last position, TACE contains a carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue. Nevertheless, because cysteine is a non-polar amino acid, the PDZ binding sequence in TACE still fits in the general hydrophobic amino acid preference for group I PDZ domains (47Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar).The first indication for a role of PTPH1 in regulating the function of TACE came from experiments in which wild type and mutant forms of PTPH1 and TACE were co-expressed. The levels of transfected mouse TACE were consistently lower in cells where wild type PTPH1 was co-expressed compared with cells expressing a catalytically inactive PTPH1 mutant (PTPH1 Cys → Ser). This effect did not depend on the presence of the band 4.1 domain, as a similar decrease in TACE levels was seen in cells expressing PTPH1 Δ4.1 compared with the catalytically inactive PTPH1 Δ4.1 Cys → Ser. Because we have been unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of the TACE cytoplasmic domain (data not shown), these results suggest that PTPH1 negatively regulates TACE levels through the dephosphorylation of other proteins.PTPH1 has been shown to interact with two other proteins, 14-3-3β and valosin-containing protein (VCP, p97/CDC48). 14-3-3β, a member of the 14-3-3 family of phosphoserine-binding proteins involved in several signal transduction pathways, binds specifically to serine-phosphorylated PTPH1 (48Zhang S.H. Kobayashi R. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27281-27287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 family members have been implicated as scaffolding proteins involved in modulating the activity of several signaling pathways, including PKC and MAP kinase pathways (49Burbelo P.D. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 95-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 50Baldin V. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 51Aitken A. Jones D. Soneji Y. Howell S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because the MAP kinase pathway is involved in regulating release of the TACE substrate TGF-α (27Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 14-3-3β could provide a link between PTPH1 and regulation of TACE levels or activity or both. The second currently known PTPH1 substrate, VCP, has a role in regulating cell cycle progression (52Zhang S.H. Liu J. Kobayashi R. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17806-17812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, other yet to be identified substrates of PTPH1 may have a role in regulating TACE levels or function. Unexpectedly, a TACE mutant that does not co-precipitate with PTPH1 responds to overexpression of wild type or mutant forms of PTPH1 in the same manner as wild type TACE. The regulation of TACE levels by PTPH1 thus does not require an interaction between these to binding partners. One possible explanation for this result is that PTPH1 and TACE may need to interact at physiological protein concentrations to regulate TACE, but that this requirement can be overcome by overexpressing of the two binding partners.To evaluate a potential functional regulation of intrinsic TACE by PTPH1, we tested how overexpressed wild type and mutant forms of PTPH1 affect the ectodomain shedding of TNF-α, a bona fide TACE substrate. We found a 25% decrease in phorbol ester-stimulated TNF-α release in cells expressing catalytically active wild type or mutant PTPH1 compared with cells expressing the corresponding catalytically inactive mutants (PTPH1 Cys → Ser or PTPH1 Δ4.1 Cys → Ser). Because Reddy et al. (11Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) have shown that the cytoplasmic domain of TACE is not required for the PMA-induced shedding of TNF-α, p75 tumor necrosis factor receptor, and interleukin-1 receptor II, we propose that the effect of PTPH1 on TNF-α shedding is likely the result of a change in TACE levels in the transfected cells as opposed to a direct regulation of TACE activity. Because a decrease in intrinsic TACE levels are difficult to ascertain in transiently transfected cells, where only a relatively small percentage of cells express the transfected proteins, further studies will be necessary to distinguish between these two possibilities.Doedens and Black (53Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14598-14607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have shown that cell surface TACE is down-regulated in response to prolonged stimulation with high doses of PMA (100 ng/ml). However, in the experiments presented here, lower doses of PMA (25 ng/ml) were used to stimulate shedding. Even prolonged exposure to these lower doses of PMA did not affect the levels of total endogenous COS-7 TACE, or the levels of overexpressed wild type or mutant forms of mouse TACE or PTPH1 (data not shown). Furthermore, we found no evidence for an effect of PMA on the interaction between TACE and PTPH1 (data not shown). Thus, our data provide no indication for a connection between the pathways responsible for down-regulation of TACE by PTPH1 and by PMA.In summary, this study provides the first evidence for a regulation of TACE by interaction with a cytoplasmic protein, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPH1. This interaction is mediated via the PDZ domain of PTPH1, which binds to the carboxyl terminus of TACE. Overexpression of PTPH1 decreases the levels of co-expressed mouse TACE, and also decreases the stimulated shedding of TNF-α, a TACE substrate. These results suggest that PTPH1 functions as a negative regulator of TACE levels as well as TACE function, most likely by dephosphorylating a yet to be identified effector. Further studies will focus on the mechanism underlying the regulation of TACE by PTPH1. Ectodomain shedding is a process in which transmembrane proteins are proteolytically cleaved to release their extracellular domain or ectodomain from the membrane. Numerous proteins, including growth factors, cytokines, growth factor receptors, and adhesion molecules, are known to undergo ectodomain shedding, and this process can have a significant impact on the biological function of its target proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Ehlers M.R.

Thus, TACE appears to act as a sheddase with broad substrate specificity and plays an important role during development.

GGT is clinically significant because elevation of its activity in serum is an efficient marker for hepatic and biliary tract-associated diseases, and the measurement of its activity in sera is widely performed in blood testing.

There are two obvious differences between E. coli GGT and mammalian GGTs. First, the N terminus of the open reading frame of E. coli GGT is a signal peptide (6Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Echigo T.

Int. 1984; 8: 581-588PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the enzyme that cleaves pro-GGT into two subunits is a membrane-bound trypsin-like serine protease, but it has never been purified. GGT mutants of E. coli K-12 which are deficient in processing have been isolated by site-directed mutagenesis, and all nonprocessed mutants so far isolated have no enzymatic activity (20Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Nohara S. Kumagai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Some mutants that undergo slow processing were observed as both processed and nonprocessed molecules that can be separated by native PAGE. When the gel was subjected to activity staining, the processed form was stained, although the nonprocessed one was not (32Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that this processing is essential for activation of the enzyme. The enzymatic reaction catalyzed by GGT has been thought to proceed via a γ-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate (1Tate S.S. Meister A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 39: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Taniguchi N. Ikeda Y. Adv. Enzymol. Rel. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 239-278PubMed Google Scholar) followed by nucleophilic substitution by water, amino acids, or peptides. Recently, we determined that the catalytic residue of E. coli GGT is Thr-391, the N-terminal residue of the small subunit (33Inoue M. Hiratake J. Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Sakata K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7764-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In fact, this residue is invariably conserved in all GGTs and related enzymes whose amino acid sequences are known. In addition, GGT is an amidohydrolase, and it takes an αββα structure (34Sakai H. Sakabe N. Sasaki K. Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Tachi H. Kumagai H. Sakabe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thr-391 is located at the end of a β-sheet, as suggested on secondary structure prediction. The GGT inactive precursor is post-translationally processed into the active mature form (32Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All of these characteristics of GGT strongly suggest that it is a member of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily, one of the structural superfamilies of amidohydrolases proposed by Branniganet al. (35Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). They found that the elements of the catalytic centers of Ntn hydrolases are equivalent in structural alignment of the active sites, and they predicted that the post-translational processing of Ntn hydrolases is an autocatalytic event. Since then, some Ntn hydrolases, the β-subunit of 20 S proteasome (36Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Frommel C. Löwe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P.M. Schmidt M.

Also, some of these studies showed that the side chains of the residues that are to be the new N-terminal residues after processing not only act as nucleophiles for the enzymatic reactions after maturation but also act as nucleophiles for the processing reactions. This may be another unique feature common to Ntn hydrolases. However, there are still some discrepancies among the detailed mechanisms of the processing reactions to be elucidated. In this paper, we show that the processing of GGT is autocatalytic, and the characteristics of its processing were studied. For clarity, the residues of E. coli GGT are numbered as a single chain (residues 1–580) comprising the signal peptide (residues 1–25), the large (α) subunit (residue 26–390), and the small (β) subunit (residues 391–580). For example, T391S means a mutant GGT (protein) whose Thr-391 was replaced by a Ser residue. LB broth (Miller) was purchased from Difco Laboratories. All antibiotics, 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine (DON), dithiothreitol, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside,p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (pCMB), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, TLCK, and TPCK were from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan).

Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1991; 72: 125-127Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to obtain pSH1183. The larger 7.5-kb EcoRI-PstI fragment of pSH1183 was ligated with the 1.3-kbEcoRI-PstI fragment of pSH253 to obtain pSH1184. pTZ18R cleaved with SacI and PstI was ligated with the 2.2-kb SacI-PstI fragment of pSH1184 to obtain pSH1196. Strain CJ236 (48Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 636-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with pSH1196 to obtain strain SH1197. Single-stranded pSH1196 was obtained by superinfecting strain SH1197 with M13KO7 (51Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). An extra 174-bp DNA was looped out from pSH1196 to obtain pSH1216 using single-stranded pSH1196 as a template and oligonucleotide dMBPGGT as a mutagenic primer by the method of Kunkel et al. (52Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The correctness of the DNA sequence of pSH1216 was confirmed by the method of Sanger et al. (53Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Strain SH641 was transformed with pMAL-p2-T391A to obtain strain SH1354 and was used to synthesize pro-MBP-T391A in the periplasm. pMAL-c2, which does not have a signal sequence of malE, is a vector to express a protein fused with MBP in the cytoplasm. The 2-kbSacI-PstI fragment of pMAL-p2-ggt was ligated with pMAL-c2 cleaved with SacI and PstI to obtain pMAL-c2-ggt. Strain SH641 was transformed with pMAL-c2-ggt to obtain strain SH1227 and was used to synthesize pro-MBP-GGT in the cytoplasm. Strain SH1307 harboring pT391C in strain SH641 was used to synthesize pro-T391C in the periplasm. pT391C was constructed as follows. pTZ18R cleaved with HindIII was ligated with the 0.9-kbHindIII fragment of pSH253 to obtain pSH1248. The ACT codon for Thr-391 was mutated to TGT using pSH1248 as a template and oligonucleotides T391CFW and T391CREV as mutagenic primers by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The correctness of the DNA sequence of the mutated plasmid was confirmed, and its 0.9-kb HindIII fragment was ligated with the 5.4-kbHindIII fragment of pSH253 to obtain pT391C. After isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside had been added to a culture of strain SH1227, a protein with a molecular weight of 100,000 was overproduced in the insoluble fraction. Because pro-MBP-GGT was estimated to have a molecular weight of 100,000, and this 100,000 protein cross-reacted with anti-E. coli GGT antiserum, this protein was purified as follows. Strain SH1227 was inoculated into a 100-ml flask containing 5 ml of LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% glucose and grown at 37 °C overnight with reciprocal shaking. Four ml of the culture was transferred to a 1-liter flask containing 400 ml of the same medium and grown at 37 °C with reciprocal shaking until the A 600 nm reached 0.4. Then, 1.2 ml of 100 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to induce overexpression of the 100,000 protein. After further incubation for 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and then subjected to ultrasonication. The precipitate obtained on centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C was dissolved in 1 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl and 1 mmEDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). The mixture was kept at room temperature for 1 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column (0.7 × 115 cm;Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted in 1-ml fractions. The fractions containing only the 100,000 protein were examined by SDS-PAGE and then stored at 4 °C until used. Strain SH1220 was grown at 20 °C in 200 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. MBP-GGT was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final 0.3 mm) and purified from the periplasmic fraction (9Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on an amylose column (0.6 × 7 cm; New England Biolabs) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer and used as a control protein. Pro-MBP-T391A was purified from the periplasmic fraction of strain SH1354 in the same manner as MBP-GGT and used as a control protein for nonprocessed GGT fused with MBP or a size marker for pro-MBP-GGT. pro-T391S was purified from the periplasmic fraction of strain HW430 in a manner similar to that for the wild-type GGT (25Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Echigo T. Tochikura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The periplasmic fraction was prepared from a 2-liter culture grown at 20 °C, and its 0–60% ammonium sulfate saturated fraction was subjected to chromatofocusing (PBE 94 column, 1 × 26 cm; Amersham Biosciences), followed by gel filtration on a Cellulofine GC-700m column (1 × 113 cm; Seikagaku-Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). The fractions containing only the 60,000 protein were examined by SDS-PAGE, precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation, and stored at 4 °C until used. Pro-T391C and pro-T391A were purified from the periplasmic fraction of strain SH1307 and HW428, respectively, and stored in the same manner as pro-T391S. In the case of pro-T391C, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to the buffer used during purification. The buffer in Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) was exchanged with 50 mm Tris-HCl with appropriate pH (pH 8 or 7) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. To remove guanidine HCl from the stored pro-MBP-GGT sample, 75 μl of purified pro-MBP-GGT was loaded on a Micro Spin column and spun down at 1,000 ×g for 4 min at 4 °C. The eluate was passed through another Micro Spin column to remove the residual guanidine HCl. To remove ammonium sulfate from the stored pro-T391C, pro-T391S, and pro-T391A samples, the samples were spun down at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the precipitate dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8 or 7) was passed through the spin columns twice as described above. The eluate from the second spin column was mixed with appropriate additives, if necessary, and then incubated at 37 °C. Pro-GGTs were used at a concentration of 0.2–0.5 mg/ml in the reaction mixture unless otherwise stated. Typically, 10 μl of a sample was withdrawn at the times indicated and mixed with 5 μl of the loading buffer containing SDS and dithiothreitol, followed by denaturation in boiling water for 3 min. Pro-GGT and the two processed subunits were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (5Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 or a silver staining kit (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) or subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (32Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using rabbit anti-E. coli GGT antiserum, anti-rabbit immunoglobulin horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (from donkey) (Amersham Biosciences), and a POD Immunostain Set (Wako Pure Chemicals). The protein band profiles on the gels were scanned with a scanner (model GT-8700F; Seiko-Epson, Suwa, Japan). The proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was stained with 0.025% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 40% methanol, followed by destaining with 50% methanol. The protein bands were cut out and then applied to an automated protein sequencer (model Procise; Applied Biosystems). Ammonium sulfate was removed from the stored pro-T391S sample as described above. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, the large subunit was isolated by the reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and its mass was measured by ion spray mass spectrometry (model API-3000; PE Sciex) as described previously (33Inoue M. Hiratake J. Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Sakata K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7764-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 55Hahimoto W. Suzuki H. Nohara S. Tachi H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 100,000 protein was isolated from strain SH1227 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After guanidine HCl had been removed, the protein was incubated at 37 °C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis. As the incubation time was increased, the 100,000 band decreased, and 80,000 and 20,000 bands increased (Fig. 1 A). Because the 100,000 protein was isolated from the insoluble fraction of a cell-free extract of strain SH1227 by procedures quite different from those we used to purify the wild-type GGT from E. coli, it was confirmed to be pro-MBP-GGT, as follows. The molecular weights of pro-MBP-GGT, the large subunit of GGT fused with MBP, and the small subunit were estimated from their amino acid sequences to be 100,000, 80,000, and 20,000, respectively. The 100,000, 80,000, and 20,000 proteins migrated the same on SDS-PAGE as pro-MBP-T391A (the processing-deficient mutant GGT fused with MBP), and the large and small subunits of MBP-GGT (the wild-type GGT fused with MBP), respectively (data not shown). Both the 100,000 and 80,000 proteins were reactive with rabbit anti- E. coli GGT antiserum and also with anti-MBP antiserum (New England Biolabs) (data not shown). Moreover, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 20,000 protein was determined to be TTHYS. After incubation, the sample showed GGT activity with γ-GpNA as a substrate. The correlation of the extent of the processing and the increase in the enzyme activity in the course of processing of pro-MBP-GGT was determined. A part of the processing reaction mixture withdrawn was mixed with the loading buffer, and the extent of processing was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Another part was incubated with 0.5 mm γ-GpNA and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.73) at 37 °C in the cuvette of a spectrometer (model UV-1600PC; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Increasing rate of absorbance at 410 nm was measured to determine the amount ofpNA released/min, and the enzymatic activity was calculated.

It is also known that chronic exposure of pancreatic islets to free fatty acids (FFAs) blunts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is accompanied by elevated levels of UCP2. However, the mechanisms regulating expression of UCP2 in β-cells are unknown. Here, we show that UCP2 mRNA and protein levels were increased after a 48-h exposure of INS-1(832/13) β-cells to oleic acid (0.5 mm) by activation of the UCP2 promoter. Furthermore, progressive deletions of the mouse UCP2 promoter (from −7.3 kb to +12 bp) indicated that an enhancer region (−86/−44) was responsible for both basal and FFA-stimulated UCP2 gene transcription. This enhancer contains tightly clustered Sp1, sterol regulatory element (SRE), and double E-Box elements. While all three sequence motifs were required for basal activity of the UCP2 promoter, the mutations in either the SRE or the E-Box elements eliminated the response to FFAs. The SRE and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1) appear to be crucial for the response of the UCP2 gene to FFAs, since overexpression of the nuclear forms of the SREBPs increased UCP2 promoter activity by 7–10-fold and restored the ability of E-Box mutants to respond to oleic acid. These data support a model in which SREBP is the major modulator of UCP2 gene transcription by FFA, while E-Box binding factors play a supportive role.

Since the discovery of the UCP2 gene and its genetic location in a region linked to hyperinsulinemia (1Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F.

Nature Genetics. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), several studies have indicated that expression of UCP2 is regulated in tandem with the level of circulating free fatty acids (FFA) (reviewed in Ref. 2Dulloo A.G. Samec S. Br. J. Nutr. 2001; 86: 123-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, increases in FFAs resulting from fasting or a high fat diet led to a stimulation of UCP2 expression in adipose tissue and muscle (3Boss O. Samec S. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 142: 111-114Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Millet L. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Larrouy D. Riou J. Ricquier D. Laville M. Langin D. J. Clin.

In isolated rat islets and INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, long term treatment with FFAs can increase UCP2 mRNA (6Lameloise N. Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms and physiological significance of these changes in UCP2 are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that the amount of UCP2 expressed in pancreatic β-cells is inversely related to the efficacy of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (8Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C.

For example, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is inhibited in rat islets following adenoviral overexpression of UCP2 (8Chan C.B. MacDonald P.E. Saleh M.C. Johns D.C. Marban E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (10Chan C.B., De Leo D. Joseph J.W. McQuaid T.S., Ha, X.F., Xu, F. Tsushima R.G. Pennefather P.S. Salapatek A.M. Wheeler M.B.

Baffy G. Perret P. Krauss S. Peroni O. Grujic D. Hagen T. Vidal-Puig A.J. Boss O. Kim Y.B. Zheng X.X. Wheeler M.B. Shulman G.I. Chan C.B. Lowell B.B. Cell. 2001; 105: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, it was reported that the increased levels of UCP2 after chronic exposure of INS-1 β-cells to FFA coincided temporally with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (6Lameloise N. Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Li L.X. Skorpen F. Egeberg K. Jorgensen I.H. Grill V. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together these results suggest that UCP2 may act as a molecular mediator for the well known chronic effects of FFA (reviewed in Ref. 11McGarry J.D. Dobbins R.L. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) to blunt glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. However, despite this compelling connection between UCP2 and insulin secretion, and the possible role of UCP2 in the development of type 2 diabetes, very little is known about the mechanisms regulating UCP2 expression in β-cells. In previous work we identified a proximal region (from −86 to −44) of the mouse UCP2 gene as an important regulator of UCP2 promoter activity in adipocytes (12Medvedev A.V. Snedden S.K. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10817-10823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This region contains several sequence elements that are also found in the transcriptionally important regulatory regions of other genes involved in energy metabolism (reviewed in Refs. 13Sul H.S. Wang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 331-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar and14Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These elements include Sp1, a sterol regulatory element (SRE), and a double E-Box-like motif separated by five nucleotides. In this study we investigated the target elements for FFA-dependent regulation of the UCP2 promoter in the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1(832/13). Our results indicate that in this particular model, SREBP1 participates in the oleic acid-dependent regulation of the UCP2 gene, and the potency of its interaction with the SRE is modulated by adjacent E-Box binding factors. Expression vectors for the nuclear forms of SREBP1a (aa 1–460) and SREBP2 (aa. 1–468) were purchased from ATCC (catalog numbers 99532 and 63452). A vector for the nuclear form of ADD1/SREBP1c (aa 1–403) was a gift from B. Spiegelman. Expression vectors for USF1 and USF2 are gifts from M. Sawadogo. UCP2 deletion constructs were designed by cloning UCP2 promoter fragments in pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Point mutation constructs of the −86/−44 enhancer were made by cloning mutated PCR fragments (−86/+12) of the UCP2 promoter in pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The integrity and fidelity of all promoter-reporter constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The clone 832/13 of the INS-1 pancreatic β-cell line (15Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) was a gift from Christopher Newgard (Duke University). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium at 11.1 mm glucose supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2). For transfection experiments, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence in six-well plates and 1.5 μg/well of total plasmid DNA in FuGENETM 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the cells. For studying the effect of long term oleic acid treatment, the transfection medium was replaced after 16 h with RPMI 1640 medium containing 4% FCS, 1% of fat-free BSA, or 0.5 mm oleic acid (Sigma) bound to BSA (3:1 ratio). Transfected cells were collected after 48 h and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using corresponding kits (Promega). Luciferase activity of the UCP2 reporter constructs was normalized to a control pCMVβ-gal reference plasmid. Whole cells or nuclear extracts were lysed, subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gel, Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes all as described previously (16Soeder K.S. Snedden S.K.

Membranes were blocked with 4% (w/v) BSA, fraction 5 (Sigma) in TBST (1× TBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20), incubated with the respective primary antibodies (the antibody titer was optimized for each antibody) followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution), and then developed using a chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to manufacturer's protocol. cDNA probes were labeled using a Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene), and hybridizations were performed using a method (17Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar) modified as described previously (18Collins S. Daniel K.W. Rohlfs E.M. Ramkumar V. Taylor I.L. Gettys T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by cell lysis in TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR reactions were performed using 0.5 μg of RNA with a Titan® One Tube RT-PCR System kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reaction mix contained two forward primers: SREBP1a-specific (5′-CGCCGCCGCCATGGACGAGC) and SREBP1c-specific (5′-GGAGCCATGGATTGCACATTTG-3′) and one reverse primer, common for both SREBP1 isoforms (5′-CAAATAGGCCAGGGAAGTCAC-3′). Nuclear extracts from cultured cells were prepared according to a modified method of Dignamet al. (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), and gel shift assays were performed as described (12Medvedev A.V. Snedden S.K. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10817-10823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The DNA binding reaction was performed in the presence of 1 μg of INS-1(832/13) nuclear extracts, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1–0.5 ng of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the −76/−44 region of the mouse UCP2 promoter. For supershift experiments, 0.5 μl of antibodies to SREBP1 (sc-8984X; Santa Cruz), SREBP2 (sc-8151X; Santa Cruz), USF1 (sc-8983X; Santa Cruz), and USF2 (sc-861X; Santa Cruz) were included in the binding reactions. Statistical differences between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and a post-hoc Newman-Keuls test or paired t test as indicated in the figure legends. All results presented are the mean ± S.D. Since UCP2 mRNA levels are increased in pancreatic β-cells after prolonged exposure to FFA (6Lameloise N. Muzzin P. Prentki M. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,7Li L.X. Skorpen F. Egeberg K. Jorgensen I.H. Grill V. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we tested whether this response resulted from transcriptional regulation of the UCP2 gene. Fig. 1 shows that prolonged treatment (48 h) of INS-1 cells with 0.5 mmoleic acid resulted in a 2-fold increase of the UCP2 mRNA (Fig.1 A) and protein levels (Fig. 1 B) and a similar increase in UCP2 promoter activity (Fig. 1 C). Based on these findings we searched for the regulatory regions in the UCP2 promoter that serve as the molecular sensor of FFAs. A series of deletion mutant constructs of the mouse UCP2 promoter was generated spanning the region between −7.3 kb (from the 3′-end of the UCP3 gene) to +12 bp from the transcription start site of the UCP2 gene. Both basal and oleate-stimulated activity of the UCP2 promoter in INS-1 cells was completely unaffected by deletions from −7.3 kb to −86 bp (Fig.2). However, the deletion of the region between positions −86 and −44 nucleotides reduced promoter activity to 3% and abolished stimulation by oleic acid, indicating that this region is responsible for the majority of the basal expression as well as the increase of UCP2 gene transcription by oleic acid.Figure 2The −86/−44 enhancer is a major regulator of both basal and oleic acid-stimulated activity of UCP2 promoter in INS-1 cells. INS-1(832/13) cells were transfected with UCP2 promoter mutant constructs as described under “Experimental Procedures” and cultured for 48 h in RPMI medium with 4% FCS and 1% fat-free BSA in the presence or absence of 0.5 mmoleate bound to BSA (3:1). Bars represent an average of three independent transfection experiments each performed in duplicate.*, significantly different from basal activity by one-way ANOVA and a post-hoc Newman-Keuls test; p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In an earlier series of experiments examining UCP2 expression in adipocytes, we described an enhancer region (−86/−44; shown schematically in TableI) in the UCP2 promoter consisting of Sp1, SRE, and double E-Box elements (12Medvedev A.V. Snedden S.K. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10817-10823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since the data in Fig. 2indicate that this region is also important for both basal and fatty acid-stimulated UCP2 gene transcription in INS-1 β-cells, we sought to define the relative contribution of these three sequence motifs to the regulation of UCP2 using a series of mutations (Table I). As shown in the last column of Table I, mutation of the Sp1 element (point mutation “Sp1m”) reduced basal activity of the UCP2 promoter by 71%, whereas a point mutation of the SRE (SREm) reduced basal promoter activity only by 40%. Mutations of the E-Boxes also reduced activity by 55.5 and by 77.4%. Deletion of all the elements up to E-Box2 (to position −58) reduced UCP2 promoter activity by over 96.6%, to the level of the minimal promoter (−44). Together these data indicate that all three sequence motifs (Sp1, SRE, and double E-Box) contribute to the basal activity of the UCP2 promoter in INS-1(832/13) cells.Table IDeletion and point mutations in the −86/−44 enhancer region of the UCP2 promoter. Open table in a new tab We next investigated which of the three motifs in the enhancer are required to mediate the response to 48 h treatment with 0.5 mm oleic acid. In transient transfection experiments in INS-1 cells, mutation of the Sp1 element (Sp1m) did not alter the response of the UCP2 promoter to oleic acid (Fig.3). However, mutation of either the SRE (SREm) or the distal (EBm1) or proximal (EBm2) parts of the double E-Box element completely eliminated the response of the UCP2 promoter to oleic acid, suggesting that both elements are required for this response. While there was a slight tendency for some residual FFA response in EBm2, it was not significant. To identify transcription factors in INS-1 cells capable of binding the functionally important SRE and double E-Box elements of the UCP2 enhancer, we performed gel shift experiments using nuclear extracts from INS-1 cells and antibodies directed against the candidate transcription factors. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) family transcription factors bind to SREs (20Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and at least one member (SREBP1) has been shown to be expressed in pancreatic β-cells (22Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Wang Z. Pan W. Shimomura I. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). While multiple transcription factors are capable of interacting with the E-Box elements, including SREBP (23Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), upstream stimulatory factors (USFs) have been reported to be major components of the complex binding to the E-Box element of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) promoter. This interaction has been proposed as important for insulin and glucose responsiveness of the FAS gene (24Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2009-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Likewise, we previously showed that in vitro translated SREBP1c binds efficiently to the SRE, while similarly prepared USF1 and USF2 bind to the E-Boxes in the UCP2 enhancer (12Medvedev A.V. Snedden S.K. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10817-10823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the idea that perhaps SREBP and USF families of transcription factors are involved in the regulation of UCP2. Therefore, using specific antibodies to the transcription factors SREBP1, SREBP2, USF1, and USF2, we tested whether these factors were present in INS-1 nuclear extracts and could specifically bind the elements of the UCP2 enhancer. The results presented in Fig. 4 indicate that SREBP1 (striped arrow) and both USF1 and USF2 (black arrow) were detected among the proteins bound to the UCP2 enhancer in these extracts. Other unidentified factors (gray arrow) were also present that were able to bind to the −76/−44 region. Therefore, next we examined SREBPs and the USFs in functional assays for their ability to regulate UCP2 gene transcription in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells. Kakuma reported that SREBP1 could be detected in β-cells (22Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Wang Z. Pan W. Shimomura I. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, SREBP1 has two isoforms, SREBP1a and SREBP1c, which differ only in their first exons and promoters (27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). The gel shift data in Fig. 4 also indicated the presence of SREBP1 (striped arrow) in INS-1(832/13) cells, but cannot distinguish between the isoforms. We used RT-PCR to specifically identify which of these isoforms were present in INS-1(832/13) cells. The results in Fig. 5 Aindicate that transcripts for both SREBP1 isoforms (1a and 1c) are expressed in INS-1 cells, while only SREBP1a is found in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (28Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Western blotting was used to estimate the relative amounts of the membrane and nuclear forms of SREBP1 (Fig.5 B). In both control and oleic acid-treated INS-1 cells more than half of the SREBP1 protein existed in the active (cleaved) form of 68 kDa, and this form was localized to the nucleus. Forty-eight hour treatment of INS-1 cells with oleic acid also did not significantly affect the cleavage of SREBP1. Although SREBP1 levels appeared to be slightly elevated in oleate-treated cells, this was not significant in several experiments. Next, we tested the effects of the nuclear forms of SREBP1a, SREBP1c/ADD1, and SREBP2 on the −7.3-kb UCP2 promoter construct in INS-1 cells. Both isoforms of SREBP1, as well as SREBP2, were able to stimulate UCP2 promoter activity (−7.3 kb/+12 bp) by 7–10-fold (Fig.6 A). In contrast, the strong binding of USFs to the E-Box elements shown in Fig. 4 did not result in equally strong transactivation. In fact, USF1 activated the UCP2 promoter very poorly (∼1.8-fold), and USF2 had no effect at all. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the strong transcriptional response of the −7.3-kb UCP2 promoter to SREBP1c was still present in the small −86/+12 fragment that contains only the −86/−44 enhancer and basal promoter regions. Perhaps not surprising, the point mutation of the SRE element within the enhancer (SREm) abolished the response to SREBP1c (Fig. 6 B). But importantly, since this mutation still leaves the E-Boxes intact, these data strongly suggest that SREBPs activate the UCP2 promoter exclusively through the SRE. This result is also in agreement with our previous observation that, despite the known dual specificity of SREBPs for both elements (23Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), in vitro translated SREBP1c can bind to the SRE but not the E-Box elements of the UCP2 promoter (12Medvedev A.V. Snedden S.K. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10817-10823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 3 showed that both the SRE and double E-Box sequences were required for oleic acid to increase UCP2 gene expression. These findings are consistent with studies of other genes, in which the SRE often requires other transcriptional elements such as nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) and Sp1 in close proximity to properly regulate gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 29Shimano H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate whether the Sp1 or E-Box elements in the −86/−44 enhancer are important for SREBP1-dependent transactivation, we examined the ability of various UCP2 enhancer mutants (Table I) to respond to SREBP1c in co-transfection experiments. As shown in Fig.7, mutation of the Sp1 element (Sp1m) had no effect on the response of the UCP2 promoter to SREBP1c. However, mutations of either the distal (EBm1) or the proximal (EBm2) E-Boxes actually led to a significant increase of UCP2 enhancer activity by SREBP1c. These data suggest that UCP2 expression might be suppressed through the double E-Box element, potentially due to its overlap with the SRE. Recall that the results in Figs. 4 and6 A showed that USF1 and USF2 transcription factors in INS-1 nuclear extract can bind efficiently to the double E-Box element, but they activate the UCP2 enhancer very poorly (USF1) or not at all (USF2). These findings together led us to investigate whether USFs act as competitive suppressors of SREBP1-dependent activation of the UCP2 gene. For these experiments the UCP2 enhancer construct (−86/+12) was co-transfected with expression plasmids for SREBP1c (0.2 μg/well) together with increasing amount of USF1. At low concentrations (0.2–0.6 μg/well), USF1 had a significant negative impact on SREBP1c-stimulated UCP2 gene transcription (Fig.8 A). However, at higher concentrations of USF1 (1.0 μg/well) UCP2 promoter activity returned to the level similar to that seen with SREBP1c alone. When the SRE mutant construct (SREm), in which the E-Boxes are still intact, was examined in the same experimental design, UCP2 expression increased linearly as a function of the amount of co-transfected USF1 (Fig.8 B). These data demonstrate that USFs can competitively interfere with the activity of SREBPs, and in the absence of SREBPs they act as weak activators.Figure 8Competitive interaction between SREBP1c and USF1 in regulation of the UCP2 enhancer.

B, SRE mutant construct (SREm, Table I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Having now demonstrated, first, that increased transcription of the UCP2 gene in INS-1 cells by oleic acid requires both the SRE and E-Box elements of the enhancer and, second, an important role for SREBP1 to regulate the UCP2 gene, we tested whether overexpression of the SREBP1c would affect the response of UCP2 to oleic acid. Fig.9 shows that 48 h of oleic acid treatment, together with overexpression of SREBP1c, leads to a further augmentation of UCP2 promoter activity beyond the effect of either one alone. Surprisingly, our data indicate that the response of the E-Box mutant to oleic acid could be restored by overexpression of the nuclear form of SREBP1c, while the SRE mutant was inactive (Fig. 9). These data support the existence of functional synergism between the SRE and the E-Box elements. This suggests that the E-Boxes play a supportive role in response of UCP2 to FFA and may be necessary to modulate the activity or binding of SREBPs. Since the original isolation of the UCP2 gene and linkage of its chromosomal position with hyperinsulinemia (1Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nature Genetics. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that this protein may play a role in maintaining cell energy homeostasis. Based on this hypothesis a number of studies linked changes in UCP2 expression to obesity and dietary manipulations such as fasting and high fat diets (3Boss O. Samec S. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 142: 111-114Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Millet L. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Larrouy D. Riou J. Ricquier D. Laville M. Langin D. J. Clin.

A. 1998; 95: 4061-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). More recently UCP2 has been implicated in the regulation of β-cell insulin secretion (reviewed in Ref. 31Saleh M.C. Wheeler M.B. Chan C.B. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 174-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In view of the well established observation that chronic exposure of β-cells to FFA dampens glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, this effect could depend upon FFA-dependent increases in UCP2 expression. However, the mechanisms regulating UCP2 in β-cells are still not clear. In this study we show that the effect of FFA on UCP2 occurs at the level of transcriptional regulation and that SREBP plays a major role in modulating UCP2 gene transcription by oleic acid. In contrast to the substantial evidence for negative regulation of SREBPs in liver by fatty acids during fasting (reviewed by Horton et al. (32Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar)), Kakuma et al. (22Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Wang Z. Pan W. Shimomura I. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8536-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) showed that the SREBP1c isoform was specifically increased in islets of obese, prediabetic (fa/fa) ZDF rats compared with lean (+/+) ZDF rats and was accompanied by increases in transcripts for several lipogenic enzymes that are target genes of SREBP1c. The mechanisms underlying this regulation of SREBP by FFA are unknown. However, a PPAR-dependent pathway is one of the likely candidates, since at least certain fatty acids can act as natural ligands for these transcription factors (33Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar), and we have found that PPARγ increases expression of UCP2 indirectly via the −86/−44 enhancer (12Medvedev A.V. Snedden S.K. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10817-10823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of PPARα in INS-1 cells could increase UCP2 mRNA and protein levels (34Tordjman K. Standley K.N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Leone T.C. Coleman T. Kelly D.P. Semenkovich C.F. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 936-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cooperation between the SRE and E-Boxes for regulation of UCP2 transcription by oleic acid could depend on E-Box binding transcription factors functioning as co-regulators of SREBP1. There is a precedent for this idea, since it is known that SREBPs often require co-regulatory factors such as Sp1 and NF-Y to efficiently activate gene expression (20Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, at present it is not clear which of the many possible E-Box binding factors are involved in regulating the UCP2 gene, and therefore we cannot propose a mechanism. In our studies we used the E-Box binding factors USF1 and USF2 because they are abundant in INS-1 nuclear extracts, and in several models they have been implicated in the control of genes involved in metabolic fuel regulation. For example, the induction of the FAS gene in liver by refeeding was severely delayed in the USF1−/− mice, while expression of SREBP1 was nearly normal (26Casado M. Vallet V.S. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2009-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, USFs are not the most likely candidate endogenous factors regulating UCP2, because our data demonstrate that USFs actually function as competitive suppressors of SREBP1c, at least in co-transfection experiments. Another interesting candidate that was the recently described (but not yet cloned) is the “carbohydrate response factor (ChoRF),” which Towle and others (38Koo S.H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,39Rufo C. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T. Koo S.H. Towle H.C. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21969-21975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have proposed as a glucose-related transcriptional activator of the S14 and FAS genes through their E-Box motifs. In summary, these results together with our previous observations (12Medvedev A.V. Snedden S.K. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10817-10823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) establish that nutritional regulation of UCP2 gene expression results from the coordinated action of several transcription factors, particularly SREBP- and E-Box-binding proteins. Future work to establish the identity of these E-Box factors and the metabolic pathways that link fuel metabolism with UCP2 should allow us to better understand the function of UCP2 not only in β-cells, but perhaps in other metabolically active tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2122857747,"Allogenic myoblast transplantation (AMT) is under investigation for treatment of severe genetic myopathies. Data regarding the role of cyclosporine (CsA) and FK-506 in AMT have shown that CsA is less effective than FK-506. For this study, we investigated mechanisms of CsA toxicity during AMT and showed that a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by CsA, mediated partly by inhibition of the peptidylprolyl-cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase)-like activity of cyclophilin A (CypA), blocked differentiation and induced apoptosis at an early stage of muscle differentiation. Inhibition of the PPIase-like activity of CypA alone also blocked muscle differentiation. However, CsA toxicity did not depend on the inhibition of calcineurin activity during muscle differentiation. Together, these data suggest that CsA-mediated inhibition of the PPIase-like activity of CypA and the high level of ROS generation contributed to the low efficacy of CsA in AMT. In addition, we showed that a reduction of oxidative stress protected cells from CsA-induced apoptosis, and myoblasts that had survived after preexposure to CsA not only proliferated and differentiated reversibly but also gained resistance to subsequent CsA exposure. Thus, administration of antioxidants or overexpression of CypA either exogenously or endogenously during CsA treatment has the potential to improve the success of this treatment in AMT."
https://openalex.org/W2133975392,"Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), Abeta precursor protein (APP), apolipoprotein E (apoE), and elevated cholesterol levels have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. High cholesterol levels increase APP and apoE expression in human NT2 neuron progenitor cells. A cholesterol-rich environment also induces processing of APP, leading to the formation of Abeta and Abeta peptide fragments. Using a novel method, we determined that 1) cholesterol binds to Abeta at alpha-secretase cleavage site; 2) Abeta17-40 rather than Abeta1-40 prevents cholesterol from binding to apoE; 3) Abeta1-40 inhibits cholesterol from binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), leading to decrease cholesterol influx and intracellular cholesterol levels; 4) the binding of cholesterol to apoE or LDL was abolished completely in presence of Abeta1-42. Increased extracellular free cholesterol levels are toxic to neurons; this toxicity is prevented by specific lipoproteins, such as high-density lipoproteins, which maintain their ability to bind cholesterol in the presence of Abeta. We propose that one of the physiological functions of Abeta and APP is to control cholesterol transport. AD is associated with increased Abeta production. High cholesterol levels also lead to overproduction of Abeta. Abeta blocks cholesterol trafficking and changes cholesterol homeostasis leading to neurodegeneration and the onset and/or progression of AD pathology."

However, several structures of the NADP+-dependent Escherichia colienzyme have been solved for the free enzyme, complexed with various ligands, and for mutants (9Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E.

Additionally, the structure of NADP+-IDH from Bacillus subtilis has recently been reported (15Singh S.K. Matsuno K. LaPorte D.C. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26154-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IDH in enteric bacteria, such asE. coli and B. subtilis, regulates substrate flux at a branch point in carbohydrate metabolism in response to changing nutritional conditions. The bacterial NADP+-IDHs are inactivated upon phosphorylation of Ser113, which is close to the Mg2+-isocitrate site (16Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on previous sequence alignments that predict an Asn residue at the position equivalent to the serine, this control mechanism did not appear to exist in a mammalian enzyme, such as the porcine NADP+-IDH. Consistent with this model, no phosphorylation of porcine heart NADP+-IDH had been detected (17Mas M.T. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1675-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The alignment of the amino acid sequence of the porcine and E. coliNADP+-IDHs indicated that they are only 16% identical. Likewise, only 17% sequence identity exists between the B. subtilis and porcine enzymes, indicating a low level of homology between the mammalian and bacterial NADP+-IDHs. Several forms of IDH are present in mammals that serve varied functions. Compared with the mitochondrial form of IDH, the NADP+-dependent cytoplasmic form of IDH is ∼70% identical and is active as a homodimer. This cytoplasmic form has an anabolic function as part of the citric acid cycle's role to provide biosynthetic intermediates, such as citrate for the ultimate formation of fatty acids. Additionally, the cytoplasmic NADP+-IDH-generated NADPH is required for the reductive biosynthesis of fatty acids. The mitochondrial NAD+-dependent IDH serves a catabolic role central for energy production as part of the citric acid cycle. However, this enzyme differs considerably from the NADP+-dependent forms. Its tertiary structure is composed of α, β, and γ subunits, and the enzyme is allosterically regulated by ADP (18Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7079-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5179-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The role of the NADP+-dependent mitochondrial IDH is less clear. Recently a link to reactive oxygen species has been suggested as the role for this mitochondrial NADP+-dependent enzyme (20Jo S.H. Son M.K. Koh H.J. Lee S.M. Song I.H. Kim Y.O. Lee Y.S. Jeong K.S. Kim W.B. Park J.W. Song B.J. Huhe T.L. J. Biol.

IDH could play a part in the control of oxidative damage in the mitochondria as a source of NADPH production. The NADP+-dependent mitochondrial IDH structure offers insights into the various functions of each of the mammalian IDHs. As the first mammalian IDH structure solved, the mitochondrial NADP+-IDH can serve to build homology models of other mammalian IDHs, particularly the cytoplasmic NADP+-IDH enzyme. The structure of an NADP+-dependent IDH will assist in addressing remaining questions about the unresolved functions of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of the enzyme. The present structure further adds to the proposed IDH mechanism from the presence of a well ordered substrate Mn2+-isocitrate complex and mechanistically important active site water molecules. Additionally, the structure reopens the question of whether mammalian IDH enzymes are covalently regulated by kinases and phosphatases as their bacterial counterparts. The plasmid pMALcIDP1 containing the gene for the recombinant native porcine heart mitochondrial NADP+-IDH fused with maltose binding protein was expressed in E. coli strain TB1, and purified to homogeneity as previously described (21Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with some modifications.E. coli cells transformed with native pMALcIDP1 were grown overnight at 37 °C in 100 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). The overnight culture was used to inoculate 8 liters of LB broth, containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml), and grown to mid-log phase (A 600 nm = 0.4–0.6). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a concentration of 0.3 mm to induce expression and shaken for 24 h at 25 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min and suspended in 200 ml of cold Buffer A (0.02 m triethanolamine chloride buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol, 0.2 mNa2SO4, and 2 mmMnSO4). Cells were frozen at −80 °C, thawed in cold water, and lysed by sonication, on ice, for 10 min with a large probe, at 20 kHz and 475 watts. The lysate was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min, and the clear supernatant was collected after removing the cell debris. The fusion protein, containing porcine heart mitochondrial NADP+-IDH, was separated from the crude extract, including the intrinsic E. coli enzyme by application to an affinity matrix, cross-linked amylose resin (22Kellermann O.K. Ferenci T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The column was washed with Buffer A until all of the endogenous E. coliNADP+-IDH and other proteins had eluted, as detected by a sensitive IDH enzymatic activity assay (see below) as well as by protein determination (21Soundar S. Jennings G.T. McAlister-Henn L. Colman R.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 8: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The porcine NADP+-IDH fusion protein was then eluted with Buffer A with the addition of 10 mm maltose. The fusion protein was then cleaved at a designed thrombin cleavage site by treatment with thrombin (40 units/mg of fusion protein) at 25 °C for 48 h, in the presence of 4 mm isocitrate. The fusion protein digest was dialyzed overnight against Buffer B (0.02 m triethanolamine chloride (pH 7.8) containing 10% glycerol), and applied to a DE-52 anion exchange column. Porcine heart NADP+-IDH was eluted with Buffer B, whereas thrombin, maltose binding protein, and uncleaved fusion protein were eluted with Buffer B containing 0.2 mNa2SO4. To ensure uncleaved fusion protein was removed from the enzyme, the porcine heart NADP+-IDH fractions were dialyzed against Buffer A and reapplied to an amylose affinity column. The purity and N-terminal homogeneity of the protein were assessed by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal amino acid sequencing on an Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequencer (model 470A) equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (model 120) and a computer (model 900A). The enzyme was stored at −80 °C in 0.1 mtriethanolamine chloride (pH 7.7) containing 0.15 mNa2SO4. The final specific activity of the purified porcine IDH enzyme was 40–45 units/mg. The expression of selenomethionine-substituted porcine heart NADP+-IDH was similar to that of the native enzyme with several modifications. To replace methionine with selenomethionine in expressed IDH, the method of Van Duyneet al. (23Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 24Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) was used, in which aspartokinase and, hence, methionine biosynthesis is inhibited. Cells from the overnight culture were centrifuged 1300 × g for 5 min and resuspended in an M9 minimal medium containing 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml proline, and 2.0 μg/ml thiamine. Once the cells had reached mid-log phase, to each culture, lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine were added to a final concentration of 100 mg/liter; isoleucine, leucine, and valine were added to 50 mg/liter; and selenomethionine was added to 60 mg/liter. After an additional 15 min of shaking, IPTG was added and the cells were expressed for 48 h at 25 °C. After the cells were harvested, they were suspended in Buffer A with the addition of 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.1 mm EDTA. The purification of the selenomethionine-substituted porcine heart NADP+-IDH was similar to that of the native enzyme with a few exceptions. To avoid oxidation of selenomethionine to its selenoxide equivalent, buffers were degassed, and 2 mmDTT and 0.1 mm EDTA were added at each step of the purification. β-Mercaptoethanol (2.5 mm) was used in the final crystallization buffer, because DTT was shown to inhibit protein crystallization. Additionally, because thrombin contains several disulfide bonds, DTT was removed from the fusion protein after the amylose column via dialysis using degassed buffers. The thrombin digestion was then carried out under anaerobic conditions by removing oxygen through exchange with nitrogen. Following the thrombin cleavage step, DTT was added to the cleavage mixture to stop the reaction. The final specific activity of the selenomethionine-substituted enzyme was similar to that of the native enzyme, but the yield of protein was 5- to 7-fold lower than that of native. To assess the incorporation of selenomethionine into the enzyme, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy was used. The result was an increase in mass of about 600 Da per subunit of IDH, indicating most of the nine possible selenomethionine sites had been incorporated with selenomethionine. Isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. The reaction mixture contained 30 mm triethanolamine chloride (pH 7.4), 4 mm dl-isocitrate, 2 mm MnSO4, and 0.1 mm NADP+. The extinction coefficient for NADPH is 6220 m−1cm−1 at 340 nm. The concentration of purified IDH was determined from E 280nm1% = 10.8 (25Johanson R.A. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 207: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A subunit M r of 46,600 was used to calculate the concentration of enzyme subunits. Crystallization of native and selenomethionine-substituted enzyme complexed with Mn2+ and isocitrate was conducted at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For the native enzyme, the optimum crystals formed in a drop containing 2 μl of protein (20 mg/ml) in 0.1 mtriethanolamine chloride (pH 7.7), 0.15 mNa2SO4, 8 mm dl-isocitrate, and 4 mm MnSO4and 2 μl of 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000 and 3% glycerol hanging over a 750-μl reservoir containing 0.1 mtriethanolamine chloride (pH 7.7), 0.15 mNa2SO4, and 20% PEG-6000. The crystals (0.15 × 0.15 × 0.03 mm) grew within 5–7 days and diffracted beyond 2.0-Å resolution. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid N2 following the equilibration in a stabilization solution containing 22% PEG-6000, 0.1 m triethanolamine chloride (pH 7.7), 0.15 m Na2SO4, 8 mm dl-isocitrate, 4 mmMnSO4, and 40% xylitol (w/v). These crystals belonged to the space group C2 and had the following unit cell dimensions: a = 138.0, b = 113.8, c = 66.8 Å, α = γ = 90.0°, β = 97.6°. For the selenomethionine-substituted enzyme, the optimum crystals formed in a drop containing 2 μl of protein (20 mg/ml) in 0.1m triethanolamine chloride (pH 7.7), 0.15 mNa2SO4, 8 mm dl-isocitrate, and 4 mm MnSO4, and 2 μl of 18% PEG-6000 and 3% glycerol hanging over a 750-μl reservoir containing 0.1 m triethanolamine chloride (pH 7.7), 0.15 m Na2SO4, and 18% PEG-6000. The crystals (0.15 × 0.15 × 0.05 mm) grew within 7–10 days and diffracted to 2.7 Å. The crystals were flash-frozen following equilibration in a stabilization solution containing 24% PEG-6000, 0.1 m triethanolamine chloride (pH 7.7), 0.15m Na2SO4, 8 mm dl-isocitrate, 4 mm MnSO4, and 40% xylitol (w/v). These crystals also belonged to the space group C2 and had the following unit cell dimensions: a = 139.0 Å, b = 114.4 Å, c = 66.6 Å, α = γ = 90.0°, β = 97.4°. Diffraction data for the native crystals were collected on a Rigaku R-Axis IV image plate detector using 0.3-mm collimated monochromatized CuKαradiation from a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. X-ray photographs of the frozen crystal were taken at 1° increments (10 min each) for 180° total oscillation of the phi angle. Raw data were collected using the Rigaku software. The single crystal diffracted to 1.85 Å and was integrated with the program DENZO and scaled with the program SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Diffraction data for the selenomethionine-substituted crystals were initially screened, and raw data were processed as mentioned for the native crystals. The final structure determination for the selenomethionine-substituted crystals was collected on the x-ray beamline X12-C at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY), using a four-module charge-coupled device chip-based detector (Phillips group, Brandeis University). Data were collected at three wavelengths: 0.97914 Å (peak), 0.97870 Å (edge), and 0.95000 Å (remote). The STRATEGY program was used to collect an optimal sweep of data, including a 180° flipped sweep of Friedel pairs to obtain complete data sets with accurate anomalous data as well. Raw data images of 50 s were collected using MARMAD software at the National Synchrotron Light Source. The single crystal diffracted to 2.6 Å and was integrated with the program DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure of the selenomethionine-substituted crystal was solved by MAD phasing (27Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). The programs SOLVE (28Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) and RESOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1872-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) were used to obtain initial phases and to apply solvent flattening and maximum likelihood density modification to improve the resulting electron density map. The program SOLVE successfully located sixteen of eighteen expected selenium sites in the dimeric enzyme. The program MAID (31Levitt D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used to automatically build a partial model of the dimeric enzyme based on the amino acid sequence and the MAD-phased electron density map to 3.1 Å. The majority of the protein backbone model was built using the program MAID (60%), although the protein chain from residues 327 to 375 on each monomer was manually built as polyalanine. Skeleton segments (32Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. CCP4 Study Weekend. CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1994: 59-66Google Scholar) were built into stretches of density where MAID failed to assemble any part of the structure. To apply non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging, an alignment was made of the Cα atoms for residues 99–161 of chain A with the corresponding atoms of chain B. The resulting NCS operator was subsequently used for the averaging of the electron density map. Real-space electron density averaging was performed using the program RAVE (33Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. CCP4 Study Weekend. CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, 1992: 91-105Google Scholar, 34Kleywegt G.J. Read R.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1557-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The averaging mask was a logical union of two masks, the first based on the 60% model built by the program MAID and the second based on the built skeleton segments. The unaveraged and averaged maps were examined with reference to the current molecule. The 2-fold-averaged map was especially helpful to identify missing regions. The N terminus of each chain, residues 1–19; the region connecting residues 80 and 93 on each chain; and residues 373–377 on each chain were observed in the averaged electron density maps. These missing residues were built as polyalanine segments using a combination of model-building tools in the program O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The alignment of sequence to structure for residues 327–375 was determined by careful examination of side-chain density in the 2-fold-averaged map. Each residue for this sequence interval on both chains was mutated to the expected residue in that position, and the side chains were fitted into the side-chain density. The model to this point consisted of residues 1–313, 327–375, and 394–406 on both chains, and for all but about 30 residues side-chain atoms were included. The model was next refined by simulated annealing in the program CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Torsion-angle dynamics were employed, using a starting temperature of 5000 °C and temperature reduction per step of 25 °C. At this point of the refinement, the R working andR free were 29 and 34%, respectively, using the remote-wavelength synchrotron data to a high resolution limit of 2.6 Å. Unaveraged and averaged 2F o −F c phase-combined electron density maps were prepared and used in the next round of model building. The experimental MAD phases were combined with model phases generated from the current structural model. The resulting electron density difference maps were examined and were used to fill in the remaining sequence gaps in the structure: residues 314–326, 377–394, and 407 to the C terminus, on both chains. These missing portions of the structure were built in a manner similar to that described above. Simulated annealing refinement of the model to this point yielded R working andR free values of 26 and 31%, respectively. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were introduced and, from this point forward, were used in CNS refinement. Initially, only the Cα atoms for residues 5–413 were restrained, using a restraint weight of 300 kcal/Å2. After two or three refinement passes, the main-chain atoms for residues 5–413 were restrained, using the same restraint weight. After switching to the native data, it was observed that almost all side chains obeyed the NCS 2-fold operation as well. Restraints were then introduced for main-chain and side-chain atoms for residues 5–410, still using 300 kcal/Å2 as the restraint weight. In the latter stages of refinement, test runs were made to determine an optimal restraint model. A series of simulated annealing refinements was run, for which the force constant was varied from 0 to 300 kcal/Å2 in steps of 50 kcal/Å2, and the restraints were applied either to main-chain and side-chain atoms or to main-chain atoms only. The value of R free did not vary strongly as a function of the restraint model. The model, for which both main-chain and side-chain atoms were restrained with a weight of 50 kcal/Å2, gave a marginally better result than the other settings and was adopted. With each successive refinement pass, some atom pairs were excluded from restraints if unaveraged and averaged 2F o − F c maps suggested that the restraint model did not apply to them. For the most part these atoms belonged to residues that were involved in crystal packing contacts. Ultimately, all but the following atoms were restrained: residues 1–4 (N terminus) and 410–413 (C terminus); residues 159–167; residues 297–300; and some side chain atoms of residues Lys28, Glu29, Gln52, Gln66, Lys90, Lys91, Asp148, Thr152, Glu169, Asn172, Gln202, Lys241, Met291, Asp400, Lys403, and Asp407. Of the 3285 pairs of non-hydrogen atoms in the dimer, 3074 pairs of atoms were restrained. The nearly complete model of the selenomethionine-substituted crystal was used as a starting model for the refinement of IDH using data to 1.85 Å from the native crystal. Based on identity of space group and near-equivalence of lattice parameters, it was not surprising that the structures were nearly isomorphous. Care was taken to flag the sameR free reflections in the native data set as were flagged in the synchrotron data set. AdditionalR free reflections for interplanar spacings from 2.6 Å to the high resolution limit of 1.85 Å were selected at random and accounted for about 10% of the total number of reflections in this resolution range. For the initial refinement passes, data from the low resolution limit to 2.5 Å were used. Rigid-body refinement in CNS gave R working andR free values of 32 and 35%, respectively. This was followed by NCS-restrained, simulated annealing refinement, which gave R working and R freevalues of 26 and 30%, respectively. The refinement was next continued using all of the diffraction data to the high resolution limit of 1.85 Å. NCS-restrained, simulated annealing refinement was repeated using a start temperature of 7500 °C. Following this, a round of individualB-factor refinement was performed. Isocitrate was built into 2F o − F c difference density in each active site. The model coordinates for isocitrate were taken from the Cambridge Structural data base (37Allen F.H. Kennard O. Chemical Design Automation News. 1993; 8: 31-37Google Scholar), code KHICIT01 (38Van der Helm D. Glusker J.P. Johnson C.K. Minkin J.A. Burow N.E. Patterson A.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1968; 24: 578-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fortuitously, the isocitrate counterion in this small molecule structure exhibited the same (1R,2S) stereochemistry as the substrate for the IDH reaction. CNS topology and parameter files and O data base files for isocitrate were generated using the program XPLO2D (39Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 208-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Ordered solvent molecules were built into difference density (coefficients F o −F c) after successive refinement passes. These locations were examined in reference to the protein structural model and 2F o − F c difference maps. Peak locations not residing in significant 2F o −F c difference density were rejected, as were locations that were either too close to or too far away from protein atoms or other solvent atoms. Two sulfate ions were placed in difference density judged too large to be waters and with the appropriate tetrahedral geometry. After individual B-factor refinement, water oxygen atoms with temperature factors above 50 Å2 were removed. The crystallographic refinement converged at R working and R freevalues of 18.2% and 21.0%, respectively. The final model of the porcine heart mitochondria NADP+-IDH crystal structure includes the entire protein chain of each subunit of the homodimer, two Mn2+ atoms, two isocitrate anions, two sulfate ions, and 715 water oxygen atoms. Fig.1 A displays the tertiary structure and fold of the porcine enzyme, which contains individual subunits of 413 amino acids, each of which has a molecular mass of 47 kDa. The overall fold is structurally homologous to the previously solved E. coli IDH and B. subtilis IDH enzyme, with most elements of secondary structure conserved. However, one region of significant departure between the structures is referred to as the clasp region of the inter-subunit interface (9Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). When both subunits are combined, the porcine IDH amino acid sequence 142–187 makes up two stacked four-stranded anti-parall"
https://openalex.org/W1551782890,"Two novel neuroprotective cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors, TV3326, (N-propargyl-(3R) aminoindan-5-yl)-ethyl methyl carbamate, and TV3279, (N-propargyl-(3S) aminoindan-5-yl)-ethyl methyl carbamate, were derived from rasagiline for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). TV3326 also inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and -B, whereas its S-isomer, TV3279, lacks MAO inhibitory activity. The action of these drugs in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, using rat PC12 and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, was examined. Both isomers stimulated the release of the non-amyloidogenic a-secretase form of soluble APP (sAPPalpha) from these cell lines. The increases in sAPPalpha, induced by TV3326 and TV3279, were dose-dependent (0.1-100 mM) and blocked by the hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor, Ro31-9790, suggesting mediation via a-secretase activity. Using several signal transduction inhibitors, we identified the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways in the enhancement of sAPPalpha release by TV3326 and TV3279. In addition, both drugs directly induced the phosphorylation of p44 and p42 MAP kinase, which was abolished by the specific inhibitors of MAP kinase activation, PD98059 and U0126. These data suggest a novel pharmacological mechanism whereby these ChE inhibitors regulate the secretory processes of APP via activation of the MAP kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2125017552,"Cryopreserved cells and tissues are increasingly used for stem cell transplantation and tissue engineering. However, their freezing, storage, and thawing is associated with severe damage, suggesting the need for better cryopreservation methods. Here, we show that activation of caspase-3 is induced during the freeze-thaw process. Moreover, we demonstrate that prevention of caspase activation by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk strongly improves the recovery and survival of several cryopreserved cell types and hematopoietic progenitor cells. A short preincubation with the caspase inhibitor after thawing also enhances the colony-forming activity of hematopoietic progenitor cells up to threefold. Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2, but not the blockade of the death receptor signaling, confers protection, indicating that cryoinjury-associated cell death is mediated by a Bcl-2-controlled mitochondrial pathway. Thus, our data suggest the use of zVAD-fmk as an efficient cryoprotective agent. The addition of caspase inhibitors may be an important tool for the cryopreservation of living cells and advantageous in cell transplantation, tissue engineering, and other genetic technologies."

We investigated SMCPA and pulmonary artery adventitial fibroblasts (FBPA) for their proliferative response to hypoxia. Strong SMCPA growth occurred under hypoxic conditions in SMCPA/FBPA co-cultures, but not in SMCPA monocultures. SMCPA growth was fully reproduced by transferring serum-free supernatant from hypoxic cultured FBPA to normoxic SMCPA. Hypoxia-inducible-transcription-factor subtypes (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, HIF-3alpha) and its dependent target genes, carrying the hypoxia-responsive-element as regulatory component, were strongly activated in both hypoxic FBPA and SMCPA. HIF-transcription-factor decoy technique, employed to FBPA during hypoxic culturing, blocked the mitogenic activity of FBPA conditioned medium on SMCPA. The data suggest that hypoxia-driven gene regulation in pulmonary artery fibroblasts results in a mitogenic stimulus on adjacent pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and HIF-transcription-decoy may offer a new therapeutic approach to suppress these events."
https://openalex.org/W2014399796,"The SspB cysteine protease ofStaphylococcus aureus is expressed in an operon, flanked by the sspA serine protease, and sspC, encoding a 12.9-kDa protein of unknown function. SspB was expressed as a 40-kDa prepropeptide pSspB, which did not undergo autocatalytic maturation. Activity of pSspB was reduced compared with 22-kDa mature SspB, but it was equivalent to mature SspB after incubation with SspA, which specifically removed the pSspB N-terminal propeptide. SspC abrogated the activity of pSspB when incubated in a 1:1 complex but had no effect on SspA or papain. Activity of the pSspB·SspC complex was restored when incubated with SspA, and SspC was cleaved by SspA but not pSspB. Thus, SspC maintains pSspB as an inert zymogen, and SspA is required for removal of the propeptide and inactivation of SspC. Like the papain protease family, SspB cleaved substrates with a hydrophobic amino acid at P2 but had a strong preference for arginine at P1. It did not cleave casein, serum albumin, IgG, or IgA, but it promoted detachment of cultured keratinocytes and cleaved fibronectin and fibrinogen at sites recognized by urokinase plasminogen activator and plasmin, respectively.

Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 26: 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Its ability to colonize and infect virtually every tissue and organ system of the body distinguishes it from many other microbial pathogens (2Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4639) Google Scholar) and is testament of an adaptive capacity that allows it to thrive or persist in the diverse conditions encountered at different infection sites. Although S. aureus is an opportunistic pathogen, it is unusually well endowed with a broad spectrum of secreted proteins, and individual strains can differ significantly in their exoprotein profiles (3Ziebandt A.K. Weber H. Rudolph J. Schmid R. Hoper D. Engelmann S. Hecker M. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 480-493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is especially apparent with toxin expression, and genomics applications have established that many toxin-related functions are associated with variable regions of the chromosome (4Fitzgerald J.R. Sturdevant D.E. Mackie S.M. Gill S.R. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8821-8826Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Although expression of specific toxins is frequently associated with distinct genetic backgrounds and disease syndromes (5Jarraud S. Mougel C. Thioulouse J. Lina G. Meugnier H. Forey F. Nesme X. Etienne J. Vandenesch F. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), the majority of S. aureus infections are not of an obviously toxigenic nature. In these situations, a core complement of secreted proteins common to all strains may represent the minimal pathogenic unit that defines the majority of suppurative tissue infections. However, the contributions of these proteins to the growth and survival of S. aureus remain poorly understood in relation to the well characterized toxins. In this context, interest in the functions of secreted proteases has recently been stimulated through the discovery by signature-tagged mutagenesis that the Staphylococcus serine protease (SspA1; V8 protease) contributes to growth and survival in each of three infection models (6Coulter S.N. Schwan W.R., Ng, E.Y. Langhorne M.H. Ritchie H.D. Westbrock-Wadman S. Hufnagle W.O. Folger K.R. Bayer A.S. Stover C.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This followed a report from our laboratory that the cell surface fibronectin-binding protein adhesin of S. aureus was sensitive to degradation by SspA, and its stability was enhanced by supplementing cultures with α2-macroglobulin, a protease inhibitor present in plasma (7McGavin M.J. Zahradka C. Rice K. Scott J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2621-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of SspA promotes enhanced stability of the cell surface fibronectin-binding protein and protein A adhesins (8Karlsson A. Saravia-Otten P. Tegmark K. Morfeldt E. Arvidson S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4742-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the metalloprotease aureolysin has also been shown to inactivate cell surface clumping factor ClfB by cleaving at a single site (9McAleese F.M. Walsh E.J. Sieprawska M. Potempa J. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29969-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These studies have implicated a role for metalloprotease and serine protease activity in controlling S. aureus adhesion functions. The metalloprotease is also essential for activation of a precursor form of the serine protease (10Drapeau G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 607-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such that inactivation of aureolysin results in a culture supernatant that is devoid of proteolytic activity (9McAleese F.M. Walsh E.J. Sieprawska M. Potempa J. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29969-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have discovered that SspA is expressed as the first gene of an operon, which encodes also a cysteine protease SspB, and a third protein of unknown function, SspC (11Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Nonpolar inactivation of sspA resulted in the SspB cysteine protease being expressed and secreted in a 40-kDa prepropeptide form pSspB, suggesting that maturation of SspB is dependent on the sequential activity of the metalloprotease and serine protease in a three-step cascade pathway. Herein, we present an analysis of the function of SspB and the roles of SspA and SspC in promoting maturation of the SspB cysteine protease. Our data establish that the Ssp operon promotes a unique mechanism of maturation for the SspB cysteine protease, which exhibits a limited substrate specificity for cleavage of specific plasma proteins. S. aureus RN6390 and RN4220 were obtained from Dr. Richard Novick (Skirball Institute, New York). S. aureus SP6391, an isogenic derivative of RN6390 possessing an sspA::erm allelic replacement mutation has been described by us previously (11Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained in brain heart infusion broth (Difco) supplemented with 15 g/liter agar when required. All cultures were grown at 37 °C, and culture media were supplemented with 10 μg/ml erythromycin or chloramphenicol, when required for plasmid propagation or maintenance of mutant phenotypes. For expression and purification of proteases, cultures were grown in medium optimized for protease expression (12Drapeau G.R. Boily Y. Houmard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6720-6726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression and purification of SspA or SspB, 2-liter flasks containing 250 ml of protease expression medium were inoculated to achieve an initial absorbance of 0.1 at 600 nm. Cultures were then grown for 18 h with orbital shaking at 250 rpm, and the cells were removed by centrifugation. S. aureusgenomic and plasmid DNA were isolated using Qiagen 100/G genomic tips and plasmid midi kits (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer's protocol for Gram-positive bacteria. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were purchased from New England BioLabs and used in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction endonuclease digestion, vector dephosphorylation, ligation reactions, phenol chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation of ligation mixtures were all conducted according to standard protocols. PCR was conducted with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Canada) and reagents, employing standard conditions. The PCR amplicons were treated with proteinase K before digestion with restriction endonuclease. DNA ligation reactions were electroporated into S. aureus RN4220 following standard protocols (13Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar).

A DNA segment encompassing the sspA promoter and complete open reading frame was amplified from genomic DNA of S. aureus RN6390 with oligonucleotide primers sspA-F4 and sspA-R1, corresponding to nucleotides 120–140 and 1573–1552, respectively, of the ssp operon (11Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A PstI site was incorporated into the sspA-F4 primer, allowing the 1.45-kb amplicon to be digested with PstI and XbaI, the latter enzyme cleaving at nucleotide 1383 of the ssp operon, 19 nucleotides from the translation stop codon of sspA. The 1.3-kb product was ligated into complementary sites of pRN5548a and electroporated into S. aureus RN4220, followed by selection for chloramphenicol-resistant colonies. The resulting plasmid, p5548-SspA, was then electroporated into S. aureus SP6391, which possess the nonpolar sspA::ermallelic replacement mutation (11Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The 40-kDa pSspB was purified from culture supernatant ofS. aureus SP6391, whereas SspA and mature SspB were purified from culture supernatant of S. aureus RN6390. Proteins were precipitated from culture supernatant by treatment with 80% saturation of ammonium sulfate, collected by centrifugation, dialyzedversus 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. Protein was applied to a Hi Prep 16/10 Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min using the Akta Prime chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was then washed with 50 ml of equilibration buffer followed by the application of a linear gradient from 0.0 to 0.5 m NaCl applied over a volume of 150 ml, collecting 2-ml fractions. Column fractions containing SspA or SspB as determined by SDS-PAGE and gelatin zymography were pooled and mixed with an equal volume of 4.0m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, then applied to a 5-ml Hi-Trap phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in 2.0 m ammonium sulfate and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Nonbound proteins were removed by washing with equilibration buffer followed by elution with a linear descending gradient of 2.0–0.0 m ammonium sulfate applied over a volume of 25 ml. Fractions containing purified SspA or SspB were pooled and desalted on a Hi Prep 26/10 desalting column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. For expression of recombinant SspC in Escherichia coli, forward primer sspB2601–2620 was paired with reverse primer sspC2991–2968, to PCR amplify a fragment spanning the last 8 codons of SspB and ending with the C-terminal amino acid codon ofsspC. The 390-bp amplicon was ligated to the pBAD-Topo TA vector (Invitrogen) creating pBAD-SspC, in which the arabinose-induced pBAD promoter is used in conjunction with the internal sspC translation initiation signals to promote expression of SspC with a C-terminal His6 tag in E. coli TOP10 cells. For expression of recombinant protein, a culture of E. coliTOP10 pBAD-SspC was grown in LB broth and induced with arabinose for induction of fusion protein expression followed by preparation of cell lysate, following recommendations provided with the pBAD-Topo TA cloning and expression system. The His6 SspC fusion protein was then affinity purified from the cell lysate using an Akta Prime chromatography system and the Hi-Trap chelating Sepharose high performance column and buffers provided with the Hi-Trap purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia), following the manufacturer's guidelines. His6-SspC was desalted employing the Hi Prep 26/10 desalting column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and purified further by anion exchange chromatography. Purified human plasma fibronectin was a generous gift from Dr. Kenneth Ingham. Resorufin-labeled casein was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Laval, Quebec). High molecular weight single-chain and two-chain kininogen, and plasminogen-depleted fibrinogen were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Human serum albumin, IgA, and IgG were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies toward different domains of kininogen have been described previously (15Kaufmann J. Haasemann M. Modrow S. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9079-9091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody MBK3 is specific for the nonapeptide bradykinin (D4 domain), HKH4 is specific for amino acids 1–123 in the D1 domain of the heavy chain, and HKL1 is directed toward amino acids 543–554 in the D6 domain of the light chain. Synthetic chromogenic protease substrates Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA, Bz-Val-Gly-Arg-pNA, Bz-l-Arg-pNA, and pyroglutamyl-Phe-Leu-pNA were purchased from Sigma. Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA was obtained from Roche. Z-Phe-Arg-pNA and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Glu-pNA were obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). All assays for proteolytic activity were conducted at 37 °C, and unless otherwise indicated, they contained 10 mm cysteine and 5 mm EDTA for assay of SspB. Assays with resorufin-labeled casein were conducted as described previously (11Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), with buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and 5 mm CaCl2 for SspA; for SspB, the buffer was 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.4. For synthetic pNA substrates, assays were conducted in triplicate wells of microtiter plates containing 1 mm substrate in 100 μl of 50 mmHEPES, pH 6.4. Plates were read at defined time points using a Bio-Rad model 3550 microplate reader equipped with a 405-nm filter. For specific activity determinations, a standard plot of absorbance at 405 nm versus the concentration of pNA was constructed and employed to quantify the amount of substrate hydrolyzed at defined time points. For pH optimum determinations, assays were conducted with McIlvaine's citrate-phosphate buffer, with the proportions of citric acid and disodium phosphate adjusted to obtain pH values ranging from 4.0 to 8.0. To assay for the effect of cysteine and EDTA, assays were conducted in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.4, containing specific supplements as indicated. Where indicated, the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 was included in assays at a concentration of 28 μm, and the serine protease inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin was included at 1 mm for inhibition of SspA where required or 28 μm for effect on SspB. For proteolysis of protein substrates, samples were incubated with SspB at the indicated molar ratios, and proteolysis was stopped at defined time points by the addition of 28 μm E-64. The samples were then precipitated by mixing with an equal volume of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid; after centrifugation, precipitated proteins were solubilized by boiling for 5 min in either reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The integrity of the protein substrate was then visualized by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. The specificity of kininogen proteolysis was assessed further by Western blotting, in which case replicate gels were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore; Bedford, MA) membrane and probed with specific antibodies. Blots were developed using goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch; West Grove, PA), with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate (Bio-Rad). Fibrinolytic activity was assayed by the fibrin plate method (16Kim W. Choi K. Kim Y. Park H. Choi J. Lee Y., Oh, H. Kwon I. Lee S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal human keratinocytes were obtained from neonatal foreskin and maintained in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (K-SFM) supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and recombinant epidermal growth factor, as described previously (17Kondo S. Kono T. Sauder D.N. McKenzie R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 690-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of the effect of SspB, keratinocytes at 80–90% confluence were treated with 0.05% trypsin for 2–3 min at 37 °C followed by 1:5 dilution of trypsin with fresh K-SFM and collection of cells by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in fresh K-SFM followed by quantification of viable cells in a hemocytometer and plating at a density of 2.5 × 104 in individual wells of 24-well cell culture plates. After growth to 80–90% confluence, cells were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, followed by the addition of fresh K-SFM containing 10 mmcysteine, and 10 μg/ml mSspB or pre-SspB. As a control, mSspB was preincubated with 28 μm E-64 at 37 °C for 30 min before the addition to cell culture plates. Cells were then visualized microscopically at hourly intervals until changes in cell morphology were observed. SDS-PAGE was conducted using the electrophoresis and sample buffer system as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean 3 apparatus. After electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane in standard transfer buffer (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar); samples for N-terminal sequence analyses were transferred to membrane using CAPS transfer buffer following established protocols (20Yuen S.W. Chui A.H. Wilson K.J. Yuan P.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 74-82PubMed Google Scholar). Protein bands on membranes for N-terminal sequence analysis were visualized by brief staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue in 40% methanol, after which the protein bands were excised with a scalpel and submitted to the University of Toronto HSC Biotechnology Center for N-terminal sequencing. For gelatin zymography, electrophoresis was conducted in SDS-polyacrylamide gels that were copolymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin as described previously (11Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As reported previously (11Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), when compared with the profile of secreted proteins from S. aureus RN6390 (Fig.1 A, lane 1), culture supernatant of S. aureus SP6391 harboring the defective sspA::erm allele exhibits loss of the SspA serine protease and a 22-kDa peptide believed to represent mature SspB, accompanied by the appearance of the 40-kDa pSspB (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Complementation of thesspA defect with p5548-SspA restored the normal profile of secreted proteins (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), whereas pRN5548a alone had no effect (Fig. 1 A, lane 3), and these changes were duplicated in a zymogram for detection of proteolytic activity (Fig. 1 B). The 22-kDa polypeptide purified from S. aureus RN6390 (Fig.2 A, lane 2) possessed an N-terminal sequence spanning amino acids 184–194 of pSspB (Fig. 2 B), indicating that processing occurred at Glu183, consistent with it having been processed by SspA, which is a member of the glutamyl endopeptidase family (21Houmard J. Drapeau G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3506-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar).Figure 2Proteolytic maturation of pSspB by the SspA serine protease. A, SDS-PAGE of culture supernatant fromS. aureus RN6390 (1.0 A 600 unit;lane 1), purified mature SspB (5.0 μg; lane 2), culture supernatant of S. aureus SP6391 (1.0A 600 units; lane 3), and purified pSspB (5 μg; lane 4). B, schematic diagram of pSspB and sites that are cleaved by SspA in proteolytic maturation. Theshaded portion (amino acids 1–183) represents the N-terminal propeptide, and the hatched segment (amino acids 184–357) designates mature SspB. Amino acids 175–193, spanning the junction of the propeptide and mature SspB, are shown above the diagram. The light underline beneath this sequence and corresponding vertical arrow represent the N-terminal sequence of purified mature SspB shown in A, lane 2, and the presumed site of processing by the SspA glutamyl endopeptidase. The heavy underlined sequence designates the N-terminal sequence of the 22-kDa product obtained by treatment of pSspB with SspA (2C, lanes 2 and 3), and the corresponding vertical arrow shows the experimentally determined site of processing by SspA in vitro. The amino acid sequence below the diagram corresponds to the N terminus of the propeptide, with the light underlinerepresenting the determined N-terminal sequence of purified pSspB shown in A, lane 4. The heavy underlinedsequence represents the determined N-terminal sequence of the 18-kDa product obtained by treatment of pSspB with SspA (C,lanes 2 and 3). The corresponding vertical arrow shows the site that is cleaved by SspA. C, SDS-PAGE demonstrating proteolytic maturation of pSspB by the SspA serine protease. Purified pSspB (30 μg) was incubated in buffer alone for 2 h (lanes 1 and 4) or supplemented with 0.3 μg of SspA (lanes 2 and 3), 0.3 μg of mature SspB (lane 5), or 0.3 μg of mature SspB and 28 μm E-64 cysteine protease inhibitor (lane 6). The absence (−) or presence (+) of cysteine and EDTA necessary for cysteine protease activity is indicated above each lane. Inlane 3, incubation was continued for 2 h after the addition of cysteine and EDTA to test for degradation of the propeptide by mature SspB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Confirmation of processing by SspA was obtained with pSspB purified from culture supernatant of S. aureus SP6391 (Fig.2 A, lane 4), which possessed an N-terminal sequence DSHSKQLEIN, corresponding to pSspB after processing by signal peptidase (Fig. 2 B). When pSspB was incubated with SspA in a 100:1 w/w ratio for 2 h, it was converted to polypeptides of 18 and 22 kDa (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). Complete conversion occurred within 15 min, and in a 60-min incubation, unprocessed pSspB was not apparent until the ratio exceeded 500:1 (data not shown). The N terminus of the 22-kDa cleavage product indicated that processing occurred at Glu177 (Fig. 2 B), compared with Glu183 for mature SspB from culture supernatant. Because the N terminus of the mature protease is preceded by a sequence that is enriched in glutamic acid (Fig. 2 B), this may allow for some variability in the site of processing, in response to differences in pH and ionic strength. The N terminus of the lower mass cleavage product corresponds to the N-terminal propeptide after cleavage at Glu8 (Fig. 2 B), and the mass of this fragment correlates with a predicted 19.1-kDa mass after cleavage by SspA at Glu8 and Glu177. Therefore, although the propeptide contains 16 glutamate residues (at positions 8, 47, 50, 60, 61, 94, 126, 132, 133, 151, 153, 165, 176, 177, 179, 183), processing by SspA is limited to specific sites. When the activity of the matured cysteine protease was activated by addition of cysteine and EDTA, the liberated propeptide remained stable during an additional 2-h incubation (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). When pSspB alone was incubated in buffer containing cysteine and EDTA, no autocatalytic processing occurred (Fig. 2 C,lane 4); and when incubated with mature SspB at a 100:1 ratio, pSspB also remained largely unprocessed (Fig. 2 C,lane 5). Therefore, there is an absolute requirement for SspA in maturation of pSspB. This differentiates pSspB from other microbial proteases, including subtilisin of Bacillus subtilus and the SpeB cysteine protease of Streptococcus pyogenes, which undergo autocatalytic maturation (22Musser J.M. Stockbauer K. Kapur V. Rudgers G.W. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shinde U. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the established paradigm for protease maturation exemplified by subtilisin of B. subtilus, the prepropeptide is an inert zymogen, and the N-terminal propeptide plays a key role in maturation. Initially, it functions as an intramolecular chaperone to facilitate folding of the precursor. Then, upon autocatalytic processing, it forms a complex with the mature protease, inhibiting its activity until degraded by the mature protease in the final step of maturation (23Shinde U. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Yabuta Y. Takagi H. Inouye M. Shinde U. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on this example, we anticipated that pSspB would represent an inert zymogen. Unexpectedly, when assayed with Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA substrate (Fig.3 A), it exhibited a constant rate of hydrolysis over a period of 3 h, but this was consistently 3–4-fold less than that of an equimolar amount of mature SspB. However, when the same amount of pSspB was assayed after treatment with SspA to remove the N-terminal propeptide, its hydrolysis kinetics were indistinguishable from mature SspB. Therefore, although pSspB did not represent an inert zymogen, its catalytic activity was enhanced after maturation with SspA. Because the N-terminal propeptide is not degraded by SspA or SspB (Fig.2 C), these data indicate that the propeptide does not function as an inhibitor of enzyme activity. Therefore, we focused our attention on SspC, the third component of the Ssp operon, which is a predicted 12.9-kDa acidic protein with no obvious signal peptide or transmembrane domains (11Rice K. Peralta R. Bast D. de Azavedo J. McGavin M.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When pSspB was preincubated with an equimolar amount of purified His6-SspC, its activity was abrogated over a 3-h incubation (Fig. 3 A). However, when SspA was added to achieve a 1:1:1 ratio of each protein, activity was restored, and the rate of hydrolysis approached that of purified mature SspB. These data suggest that SspC is a specific inhibitor of SspB and is inactivated by SspA. Accordingly, SspC also inhibited mature SspB but exhibited negligible inhibition of SspA or the nonrelated cysteine protease, papain (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, when SspC was incubated with SspA at a 10:1 molar ratio, it was cleaved rapidly to a lower molecular weight product (Fig.4 A), whereas pSspB did not cleave SspC at the same 10:1 ratio (Fig. 4 B). Cumulatively, these data establish that SspC functions to maintain pSspB as an inert zymogen, with maturation of pSspB being dependent on SspA to cleave the N-terminal propeptide and to inactivate SspC. When assayed for activity toward Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA in McIlvaine's citrate-phosphate buffer at pH values ranging from 4.0 to 8.0, activity peaked between pH 6.0 and 6.4 (97 and 100% activity) and declined at pH 5.4 (69%) and 7.4 (71%). Additional assays for effect of buffer composition and substrate specificity were conducted in 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.4, as the basal buffer (TableI). SspB was inactive in the absence of cysteine and stimulated by EDTA, but not unless cysteine was also present. SspB was inactivated by the cystei"
https://openalex.org/W2055031028,"Steady-state and transient-kinetic studies were conducted to characterize the overall and partial reactions of the Ca2+-transport cycle mediated by the human sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 3 (SERCA3) isoforms: SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c. Relative to SERCA1a, all three human SERCA3 enzymes displayed a reduced apparent affinity for cytosolic Ca2+ in activation of the overall reaction due to a decreased E 2 toE 1Ca2 transition rate and an increased rate of Ca2+ dissociation fromE 1Ca2. At neutral pH, the ATPase activity of the SERCA3 enzymes was not significantly enhanced upon permeabilization of the microsomal vesicles with calcium ionophore, indicating a difference from SERCA1a with respect to regulation of the lumenal Ca2+ level (either an enhanced efflux of lumenal Ca2+ through the pump in E 2 form or insensitivity to inhibition by lumenal Ca2+). Other differences from SERCA1a with respect to the overall ATPase reaction were an alkaline shift of the pH optimum, increased catalytic turnover rate at pH optimum (highest for SERCA3b, the isoform with the longest C terminus), and an increased sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate that disappeared under equilibrium conditions in the absence of Ca2+ and ATP. The transient-kinetic analysis traced several of the differences from SERCA1a to an enhancement of the rate of dephosphorylation of the E 2P phosphoenzyme intermediate, which was most pronounced at alkaline pH and increased with the length of the alternatively spliced C terminus. Steady-state and transient-kinetic studies were conducted to characterize the overall and partial reactions of the Ca2+-transport cycle mediated by the human sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 3 (SERCA3) isoforms: SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c.

Studies of the SERCA1a enzyme have shown that Ca2+transport and ATP utilization are coupled through long-range intramolecular interactions between the 10-helix transmembrane domain containing the Ca2+ binding sites and the cytoplasmic actuator, phosphorylation, and nucleotide-binding domains (1MacLennan D.H.

Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Google Scholar), the binding of the two calcium ions with high affinity from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane triggers the phosphorylation of Asp351 by ATP, whereas the dephosphorylation occurs when the translocated calcium ions have been released from low-affinity lumenally facing sites in exchange with protons being countertransported (SchemeFS1). The SERCAs have long been known as key enzymes in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ signaling events, and more recent studies have also drawn attention to the importance of the luminal Ca2+content for Ca2+ signaling, folding and processing of newly synthesized proteins, and control of cell growth and apoptosis (6Corbett E.F.

Previously, the rat SERCA3 gene (16Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Google Scholar) was shown to encode a Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA3a according to the present nomenclature) that in steady-state measurements of Ca2+ uptake activity showed peculiar functional properties as compared with SERCA1 and SERCA2 isoforms: a reduced apparent affinity for cytoplasmic Ca2+, an increased apparent affinity for vanadate inhibition, and an altered pH optimum (pH 7.2–7.4 versus pH 6.8–7.0) (17Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Google Scholar). SERCA3 enzyme is present in a number of non-muscle cell types where Ca2+ signaling plays a critical role in regulating physiological processes. SERCA3 is always co-expressed along with SERCA2b, and the expression level of SERCA3 varies dramatically from tissue to tissue (16Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Specific changes to SERCA3 expression and mutations in the SERCA3 gene have been linked with pathological conditions such as type II diabetes (23Varadi A. Molnar E. Östenson C.-G. Ashcroft S.J.H.

Panis Y. Martin V. Bredoux R. Enouf J. Papp B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26310-26320Google Scholar). The human SERCA3a has been cloned from a Jurkat cell line, and the localization of the SERCA3 gene (ATP2A3) on human chromosome 17p13.3, as well as the complete structure of the human SERCA3 gene, has been documented (12Dode L. Wuytack F. Kools P.F.J. Baba-Aissa F. Raeymaekers L. Briké F. Van De Ven W.J.M. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 689-699Google Scholar, 13Dode L. De Greef C. Mountian I. Attard M. Town M.M. Casteels R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13982-13994Google Scholar). It was shown that human and mouse SERCA3 gene primary transcripts are alternatively spliced (13Dode L. De Greef C. Mountian I. Attard M. Town M.M. Casteels R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13982-13994Google Scholar, 14Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 259-264Google Scholar), thereby generating three distinct isoforms: SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, that are identical in the first 993 amino acid residues (exhibiting 75% sequence identity with SERCA1), but differ in the C terminus (5 or 6, 50, and 36 amino acids long, for SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, respectively). In addition, evidence for two novel human SERCA3 splice products, SERCA3d and SERCA3e, with C termini of about the same length as SERCA3b has been recently reported (15Martin V. Bredoux R. Corvazier E. Van Gorp R. Kovács T. Gélébart P. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24442-24452Google Scholar). An important challenge is to understand the advantage of having such a diversity of SERCA isoforms and, in this context, to determine the kinetic and mechanistic differences between them. On the basis of the aforementioned steady-state functional analysis of rat SERCA3a (17Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Google Scholar), it was proposed that in SERCA3, the equilibrium between the major conformational states E 1 andE 2 is likely shifted, relative to SERCA1 and SERCA2, in favor of the E 2 form exhibiting low Ca2+ affinity, but so far this hypothesis has not been substantiated by measurements of the partial reaction steps. Even though the Ca2+ binding residues in the transmembrane domain are conserved among the SERCA isoforms, the Ca2+affinity of the E 1 conformation might differ between the isoforms due to long-range effects of amino acid differences elsewhere in the proteins. With a newly proposed role of SERCA3 isoforms in differential modulation of the lumenal Ca2+ concentration levels (15Martin V. Bredoux R. Corvazier E. Van Gorp R. Kovács T. Gélébart P. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24442-24452Google Scholar), it furthermore becomes increasingly important to examine both the steps decisive for cytoplasmic Ca2+ binding as well as the steps controlling the lumenal Ca2+ affinity in the various isoforms. In the present study, we have carried out an in depth analysis of the catalytic cycle of the human SERCA3a, b, and c isoforms. Methods for steady-state as well as transient-kinetic characterization of the partial reaction steps of SERCA enzyme expressed in mammalian cell culture have previously been established in connection with studies on SERCA1 mutants (32Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Google Scholar, 33Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Google Scholar, 34Sørensen T.L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar, 35Andersen J.P. Sørensen T.L.-M. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Google Scholar) and were directly applicable to expressed SERCA3 isoforms. In particular, we have studied several steps by rapid kinetic measurements, some performed on a millisecond time scale using quench-flow methodology (cf. Refs. 34Sørensen T.L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar and 35Andersen J.P. Sørensen T.L.-M. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Google Scholar). We report here kinetic differences between the three human SERCA3 isoforms and SERCA1a that have consequences not only for Ca2+ binding at cytoplasmic sites, but also for the adjustment of the free Ca2+ concentration in the lumen. The SERCA3 enzymes manifest true low affinity of the E 1 form for cytosolic Ca2+, and one partial reaction step of importance for the lumenal Ca2+ content, the dephosphorylation of theE 2P phosphoenzyme intermediate, showed significant variation among the SERCA3 isoforms. A full-length cDNA clone encoding the human SERCA3b isoform was constructed by replacing a SERCA3c-specific 3′-end cDNA fragment with the corresponding SERCA3b-specific 3′-end obtained previously via RT-PCR amplification from human kidney (13Dode L. De Greef C. Mountian I. Attard M. Town M.M. Casteels R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13982-13994Google Scholar). The full-length human SERCA3b cDNA was then transferred into mammalian expression vector pMT2. The cDNA constructs in pMT2 encoding human SERCA3a (HuS3-I and HuS3-II clones) and SERCA3c (HuS3-IV clone) isoforms (14Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Lytton, University of Calgary, Canada. Other constructs used include rabbit SERCA1a (36Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3768-3774Google Scholar) and mouse SERCA3b (13Dode L. De Greef C. Mountian I. Attard M. Town M.M. Casteels R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13982-13994Google Scholar) cDNAs in pMT2 vector and pig SERCA2b cDNA in pSV57 vector (37Verboomen H. Wuytack F. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 591-596Google Scholar). For expression, the DNA was transfected into HEK-293 or COS-1 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (38Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction containing expressed wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase was isolated by differential centrifugation (39Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Google Scholar). Platelet membrane vesicles were isolated from human platelet-rich plasma as previously described (40Papp B. Enyedi A. Kovács T. Sarkadi B. Wuytack F. Thastrup O. Gardos G. Bredoux R. Lévy-Toledano S. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14593-14596Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Denaturing-gel electrophoresis, semi-dry blotting, and blot immunostaining were done as reported earlier (19Wuytack F. Papp B. Verboomen H. Raeymaekers L. Dode L. Bobe R. Enouf J. Bokkala S. Authi K.S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1410-1416Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide (EVSAGNRVESPVCTSD) corresponding to the extreme C terminus of human SERCA3b, was used to generate a SERCA3b-specific antibody (H3b) as previously described for preparation of the N89 antibody (19Wuytack F. Papp B. Verboomen H. Raeymaekers L. Dode L. Bobe R. Enouf J. Bokkala S. Authi K.S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1410-1416Google Scholar). The PL/IM430 monoclonal antibody (Research Diagnostics) was initially raised against highly purified human platelet intracellular membranes (41Hack N. Wilkinson J.M. Crawford N. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 355-361Google Scholar) and shown to specifically recognize human SERCA3 isoforms (14Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar, 15Martin V. Bredoux R. Corvazier E. Van Gorp R. Kovács T. Gélébart P. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24442-24452Google Scholar). 45Ca2+ uptake in the microsomal vesicles was measured by filtration (33Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Google Scholar) after incubation at 27 °C or 37 °C in a medium containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 5.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm potassium oxalate, and 45CaCl2to obtain various free Ca2+ concentrations. Ca2+-activated ATP hydrolysis was measured by following the liberation of inorganic phosphate by the Baginski method (33Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Google Scholar, 42Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chem. 1967; 13: 326-332Google Scholar). The various CaCl2 concentrations used to obtain the required free Ca2+ concentration were calculated with the MAXC computer software using the dissociation constants therein (43Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Google Scholar). The amount of expressed enzyme (pmol ATPase/mg microsomal protein) was quantified by determining the maximum capacity for phosphorylation from ATP at 0 °C (“active site concentration”) relative to the total microsomal protein. Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP and inorganic phosphate (32Pi) and dephosphorylation assays at 0 °C were performed using a manual mixing technique (33Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Google Scholar). Rapid kinetic experiments at 25 °C were performed by use of a Bio-Logic quench-flow module QFM-5 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) according to the protocols described previously (34Sørensen T.L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar). All phosphorylation reactions (with either [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi) were terminated by acid quenching, and the acid-precipitated microsomal proteins were processed as described (32Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Google Scholar, 34Sørensen T.L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase band was quantified by means of imaging, using Packard Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System. Appropriate background phosphorylation levels (obtained in the presence of excess EGTA or Ca2+ for phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP and32Pi, respectively) were subtracted before data analysis. Further details of the functional assays are given in the figure legends. Experimental data presented are average values corresponding to 2–8 determinations, and standard errors larger than the size of the symbols are shown as error bars in the figures. The data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS Inc.), and the best fits are shown as lines in the figures. Extracted parameters ± S.E. are given in the figure legends. The analysis of ligand concentration dependences was based on the Hill function, whereas the data for the pH dependence of the ATPase activity were fitted by a classical Michaelis pH function using the equation V=Vmax/(1+([H+]/K1)+(K2/[H+]))(Eq. 1) where K 1 and K 2are the molecular dissociation constants (mol·liter−1) of the intermediate forms of a dibasic acid (44Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd, London, U.K.2001Google Scholar). The time courses of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were analyzed by fitting first-order kinetic equations, or by using the kinetic simulation software SimZyme developed in the Department of Physiology, University of Aarhus, Denmark, as previously described (34Sørensen T.L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar). The rate constant for Ca2+ dissociation, k−Ca, was calculated as before (34Sørensen T.L.-M. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar). The expression levels of SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c obtained following transfection of HEK-293 or COS-1 cells, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (38Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar), did not differ significantly from that obtained for SERCA1a, as determined by the phosphorylation method (see “Experimental Procedures,” data not shown). Fig.1 A shows a typical Western blot analysis of microsomal proteins from transfected HEK-293 cells, using the polyclonal antibody N89 (top panel) raised against an epitope close to the N terminus of rat SERCA3 (19Wuytack F. Papp B. Verboomen H. Raeymaekers L. Dode L. Bobe R. Enouf J. Bokkala S. Authi K.S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1410-1416Google Scholar), the human SERCA3-specific monoclonal antibody PL/IM430 (middle panel), and a newly developed human SERCA3b-specific antibody H3b (bottom panel) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All three antibodies specifically recognized the indicated SERCA3 proteins with no detectable cross-reactivity against endogenously or exogenously expressed SERCA2b proteins in HEK-293 cells. In all cases, SERCA3 proteins were well resolved by SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to their size (human SERCA3a encoded by clone HuS3-II (14Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar), 998 amino acids; human SERCA3b, 1043 amino acids; human SERCA3c, 1029 amino acids; mouse SERCA3b, 1038 amino acids). In addition, Fig. 1 B demonstrates the expression of human SERCA3b in human platelets as revealed by Western blot analysis carried out with PL/IM430 (upper panel) and H3b (lower panel) antibodies. The SERCA3 isoform encoded by clone HuS3-I was also well expressed and was specifically stained with N89 and PL/IM430 antibodies (data not shown, but see Ref. 14Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar). The two cDNA clones HuS3-I and HuS3-II represent different alleles of the human SERCA3 gene in Jurkat cells. Throughout this study, the isoform encoded by clone HuS3-II is referred to as the SERCA3a isoform, whereas the inactive (see below) SERCA3a isoform encoded by clone HuS3-I (14Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar) is referred to as SERCA3a-I. The proteins denoted SERCA3a, b, and c are identical at the first 993 residues, whereas, as previously described (14Poch E. Leach S. Snape S. Cacic T. MacLennan D.H. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1449-C1458Google Scholar), SERCA3a-I differs from SERCA3a at 3 positions: Thr673 is replaced by alanine, Met817 is replaced by isoleucine, and Glu994 is included in the C terminus. Microsomal membranes isolated from transfected cells were tested for ATP-driven45Ca2+ transport activity in the presence of a saturating free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm, and 5 mm oxalate to trap the transported Ca2+inside the vesicles. Following normalization of the data on the basis of the amount of SERCA enzyme expressed, the specific Ca2+accumulation rate calculated corresponding to the initial linear phase was 85 ± 4, 73 ± 6, and 98 ± 9% (average value ± S.E.) for SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c, respectively, relative to the specific rate determined for SERCA1a. Hence, under these conditions the transport rates of SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c did not differ significantly from each other or from that of SERCA1a. On the other hand, the Ca2+ uptake activity of the SERCA3a-I isoform was indistinguishable from the background activity of control microsomes (data not shown), although, as mentioned above, the SERCA3a-I protein was well expressed. The respective K 0.5 values for Ca2+activation determined by titration of the Ca2+ dependence of the transport activity were for SERCA1a, SERCA3a, SERCA3b, and SERCA3c (value obtained by fitting the Hill equation ± S.E.): 0.40 ± 0.02, 1.69 ± 0.14, 1.34 ± 0.11, and 1.82 ± 0.18 μm (data not shown), indicating that the apparent Ca2+ affinities displayed by the SERCA3 isoforms are 3- to 5-fold lower than corresponding to SERCA1a, in good agreement with previous Ca2+ uptake measurements on rat SERCA3a (17Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Google Scholar). Steady-state ATPase activity of SERCA1a and the SERCA3 isoforms was determined in the presence of 5 mm MgATP without a Ca2+ trapping agent in the vesicles. The catalytic turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the ATPase activity and the amount of expressed enzyme (see “Experimental Procedures”). For SERCA3a-I, the level of ATPase activity was indistinguishable from background under all conditions tested, and no data are shown. For the other SERCA3 isoforms and SERCA1a, Fig. 2 shows the Ca2+ dependence of the turnover rate at pH 7.0 in the presence and absence of the calcium ionophore A23187. Consistent with the Ca2+ uptake data presented above, the SERCA3 enzymes displayed 4- to 5-fold lower apparent affinity for Ca2+ at the activating sites as compared with SERCA1a. The maximum turnover rate attained in the absence of ionophore (i.e. under conditions of Ca2+ accumulation in the microsomal vesicles) was 2-fold higher than that determined for SERCA1a (Fig. 2). The calcium ionophore allows a high rate of passive efflux of the calcium ions transported into the microsomes, thereby ensuring that the lumenal Ca2+ concentration is maintained at the same level as that of the medium. For medium Ca2+ concentrations in the micromolar range, this relieves the “back inhibition” of theE 1∼P(Ca2) toE 2 P partial reaction in SERCA1a imposed by binding of accumulated Ca2+ at lumenal low affinity sites (cf. Scheme FS1). Fig. 2 shows that the addition of calcium ionophore stimulated the rate of ATP hydrolysis close to 3-fold for SERCA1a. By contrast, the ATPase activity of the SERCA3 enzymes was almost unaffected by the ionophore (Fig. 2, see also Table I).Table ISelected results summarizing the present functional comparison of SERCA1a and SERCA3 enzymesCa2+-ATPase isoformTurnover rate at pH optimumaTurnover rate for ATP hydrolysis at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μM Ca2+ and calcium ionophore at pH optimum (Fig. 3).pH optimumbpH optimum for the ATPase reaction in presence of calcium ionophore (Fig. 3).Ionophore effect at pH 7.0cThe ratio between the ATPase activities with and without calcium ionophore at 10 μM Ca2+(Fig. 2).K 0.5for Ca2+activationdThe Ca2+ concentration giving half-maximum activation of phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4).Rate ofE 2P dephosphorylation at pH 8.5eRate of dephosphorylation at 0 °C and pH 8.5 of phosphoenzyme formed in the presence of32Pi (Fig. 8 C).Rate ofE 2 to E 1Ca2transitionfAverage of results obtained in 2 types of rapid kinetic phosphorylation experiments at 25 °C (Figs. 9and 10).Rate of E 1 ∼ P(Ca2) to E 2P transitiongRate constant determined in single turnover experiment at 25 °C (Fig. 12).Rate of Ca2+dissociationhRate of disappearance of ability to phosphorylate from [γ-32P]ATP upon addition of EGTA at 25 °C (Fig. 11).K 0.5for vanadate inhibitioniFrom Fig. 13, A andB.TurnoverEquilibriums−1μms−1s−1s−1s−1μmμmSERCA1a957.233.020.320.0032452711.30"

To evaluate the impact of SERCA2a overexpression on SR Ca2+ handling in diabetic CM, we 1) generated transgenic rats harboring a human cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken beta-actin promotor-controlled rat SERCA2 transgene (SERCA2-TGR), 2) characterized their SR phenotype, and 3) examined whether transgene expression may rescue SR Ca2+ transport in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The transgene was expressed in all heart chambers. Compared to wild-type (WT) rats, a heterozygous line exhibited increased SERCA2 mRNA (1.5-fold), SERCA2 protein (+26%) and SR Ca2+ uptake (+37%). Phospholamban expression was not altered. In SERCA2-TGR, contraction amplitude (+48%) and rates of contraction (+34%) and relaxation (+35%) of isolated papillary muscles (PM) were increased (P2+ uptake and SERCA2 protein of SERCA2-TGR were 1.3-fold higher (P2+ uptake, accelerates relaxation and compensates, in part, for depressed Ca2+ uptake in diabetic CM. Therefore, SERCA2 expression might constitute an important therapeutic target to rescue cardiac SR Ca2+ handling in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2034030158,"Nef, a multifunctional HIV protein, activates the Vav/Rac/p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling pathway. Given the potential role of this pathway in the activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, we have investigated the effect of the HIV-1 Nef protein on the phagocyte respiratory burst. Microglia (cell line and primary culture) were transduced with lentiviral expression vectors. Expression of Nef did not activate the NADPH oxidase by itself but led to a massive enhancement of the responses to a variety of stimuli (Ca2+ ionophore, formyl peptide, endotoxin). These effects were not caused by up-regulation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase subunits. Nef mutants lacking motifs involved in the interaction with Vav and PAK failed to reproduce the effects of wild type Nef, suggesting a role for the Vav/Rac/PAK signaling pathway. The following results suggest a key role for Rac in the priming effect of Nef. (i) Inactivation of Rac by Clostridium difficile toxin B abolished the Nef effect. (ii) The fraction of activated Rac1 was increased in Nef-transduced cells, and (iii) the dominant positive Rac1(V12) mutant mimicked the effect of Nef. These results are to our knowledge the first analysis of the effect of Rac activation on the NADPH oxidase in intact phagocytes. Rac activation is not sufficient to stimulate the phagocyte NADPH oxidase; however, it markedly enhances the NADPH oxidase response to other stimuli.

Nef mutants lacking motifs involved in the interaction with Vav and PAK failed to reproduce the effects of wild type Nef, suggesting a role for the Vav/Rac/PAK signaling pathway. The following results suggest a key role for Rac in the priming effect of Nef. (i) Inactivation of Rac by Clostridium difficile toxin B abolished the Nef effect. (ii) The fraction of activated Rac1 was increased in Nef-transduced cells, and (iii) the dominant positive Rac1(V12) mutant mimicked the effect of Nef. These results are to our knowledge the first analysis of the effect of Rac activation on the NADPH oxidase in intact phagocytes. Rac activation is not sufficient to stimulate the phagocyte NADPH oxidase; however, it markedly enhances the NADPH oxidase response to other stimuli. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate cytotoxic-necrotizing factor 1 Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding diphenyl iodonium granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate salt p21-activated kinase phorbol myristate acetate Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor glutathione S-transferase FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate Nef is a 27–34 kDa protein expressed by primate lentiviruses. It is the first viral protein detectable after HIV-11 infection, and it is expressed throughout all stages of infection. While Nef is known to enhance virus production and infectivity, it has recently been recognized that Nef also exerts pathogenic effects independently of viral replication. Indeed, transgenic mice carrying the Nefgene under the control of the CD4 promoter (thus limiting expression to CD4+ T-cells and macrophages, the primary target cells of HIV) developed a disease state reminiscent of AIDS with severe CD4+ T-cell anergy and atrophy of lymphoid organs (1Hanna Z. Kay D. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Nef is also important for the progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals (2Kirchhoff F. Greenough T.C. Brettler D.B. Sullivan J.L. Desrosiers R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar).Nef is a cytoplasmic protein, which associates with membranes via myristoylation. Despite its small size, Nef presents a relatively large surface area for protein interaction (3Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Binding of Nef to a multitude of host proteins, including plasma membrane receptors, sorting receptors, and signaling proteins, has been documented (3Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 4Marsh J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The majority of in vitro studies investigating the cellular effects of Nef expression in the target cells of HIV has been performed with CD4+ T-cells. Negative, neutral, and positive effects of Nef on T-cell signaling and activation have been noted (4Marsh J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Macrophages, which express both CD4 and CCR5 required for viral binding and entry (5Jordan C.A. Watkins B.A. Kufta C. Dubois-Dalcq M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 736-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6He J.

Nature. 1997; 385: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), constitute an important target of HIV. Recently, it has been shown that one effect of Nef in tissue macrophages is the induction of secretion of the CC-chemokines, MIP-1α and MIP-1β, which are chemotactic for CD4+ T-cells (7Swingler S. Mann A. Jacque J.M. Brichacek B. Sasseville V.G. Williams K. Lackner A.A. Janoff E.N. Wang R. Fisher D. Stevenson M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Other effects noted in macrophage primary cells or cell lines includes altered Ca2+-signaling (8Foti M. Cartier L. Piguet V. Lew D. Carpentier J. Trono D. Krause K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34765-34772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), induction of IL-10 production (9Brigino E. Haraguchi S. Koutsonikolis A. Cianciolo G. Owens U. Good R.

Saksela K. Mann D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Microglia are phagocytes of myeloid origin, located in the central nervous system. Together with macrophages they are the principal target of HIV infection in the central nervous system (5Jordan C.A. Watkins B.A. Kufta C. Dubois-Dalcq M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 736-742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6He J. Chen Y. Farzan M. Choe H. Ohagen A. Gartner S. Busciglio J. Yang X., W., H. Newman W. Mackay C.R. Sodroski J. Gabuzda D.

Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and express all components of the superoxide generating phagocyte NADPH oxidase (this study). This enzyme consists of membrane-bound subunits, gp91phox and p22phox, which constitute the flavocytochromeb 558 complex, and cytosolic subunits p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox. Translocation of the cytosolic phox proteins to the membrane is required for initiation of superoxide production (13Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 14Park J.W., Ma, M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the role of p40phox remains undefined, evidence points to a role of p47phox as an adaptor between flavocytochromeb 558 and p67phox (15de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). During activation inhibitory intramolecular SH3 domain interactions in p47phox are relieved via phosphorylation events (16Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and allows the protein to make direct contact with p22phox, thereby bringing p67phox to the membrane where it in turn makes direct contact with gp91phox (17Dang P.M. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, translocation of cytosolic phox proteins to the flavocytochrome b 558 is not sufficient to activate the oxidase. For electron transfer reactions to occur, the presence of the small cytosolic GTPase Rac (1 or 2) is absolutely required (18Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 19Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that Rac via direct interactions with p67phox and gp91phoxregulates electron transfer reactions of the assembled oxidase (20Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Whereas human neutrophils predominantly express Rac2, NADPH oxidase activation in macrophages involves Rac1 (18Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 19Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar).We here demonstrate that Nef protein through activation of Rac1 leads to priming of the NADPH oxidase in microglia. Introduction of Nef or a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 into microglia did not lead to NADPH oxidase activation on their own but dramatically enhanced superoxide release following subsequent challenge with the Ca2+ ionophore, formyl peptide or LPS.RESULTSAs classical methods do not allow efficient transfection of microglia (data not shown), we made use of lentiviral transduction (24Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Transduction of the Ra2 microglia with a Nef-expressing vector led to efficient expression of the HIV Nef protein. By adding increasing doses of the concentrated viral vector, cell populations with graded levels of Nef expression were generated for initial characterization (Fig. 1 a). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that the great majority of microglial cells stained positively for the Nef antigen after transduction (93.3 ± 2.5%, n = 3). The distribution of wild type Nef was discrete and differed from the diffuse cytoplasmic staining of the NefG2A mutant (see Fig. 1, b–d) deficient in myristoylation (and thereby membrane attachment) and previously described to be inactive in virtually all functions of Nef (3Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In general, Nef-transduced cells could be directly distinguished from non-transduced or control-transduced cells by an altered morphology as noted previously in fibroblastic cells (29Fackler O. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A. Peterlin B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The cells became more stellate, and developed numerous cell projections at sites of cell contact with the substratum. This change was reflected in an altered actin cytoskeleton as demonstrated by phalloidin staining to reveal filamentous actin (Fig. 1, e and f). Whereas F-actin in NefG2A and control cells was pronounced at sites of cell-cell contact, lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, the Nef-transduced cells displayed F-actin in numerous multiple branched cellular projections, and often long actin fibers could be observed traversing the cells.Nef-transduced Cells Show IncreasedO 2− Production in Response to Stimulation with Ca2+ Ionophore, Formyl Peptides, and EndotoxinIn initial experiments, we investigated the response of microglia to activation by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Indeed, elevations of the cytosolic free Ca2+concentration, [Ca2+]c, are a part of the activation machinery coupling receptor ligation to NADPH oxidase activation (30Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Petersson F. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. Nüsse O. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As determined by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (Fig. 2, a andb), ionomycin-induced [Ca2+]celevations did not elicit a significant superoxide release in control-transduced microglia. However, Nef-expression rendered cells susceptible to stimulation with ionomycin in a Nef dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, a andb). Nef expression did not cause an increased superoxide release under basal unstimulated conditions (Fig. 2 a,inset). These observations were confirmed by using the reactive oxygen species-sensitive probe, CM-DCF, as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Using this technique, ionomycin stimulation of Nef-expressing cells caused a 4.7 ± 1.9-fold increase in fluorescence intensity relative to control-transduced cells (n = 34).The luminol-enhanced chemiluminescent signal was inhibited by 10 μm diphenyle iodonium (DPI) an inhibitor of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and other flavoproteins (inhibition 91.6% ± 1.9,n = 4), as well as by 200 units/ml superoxide dismutase (inhibition 96.7% ± 1.7, n = 3), indicating that superoxide was absolutely required to generate the signal. However, because luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence also detects peroxynitrite (31Wang J.F. Komarov P. de Groot H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the reaction product of superoxide and NO, we also measured the effect of preincubation with the competitive NO synthetase inhibitorl-NMMA. As seen in Fig. 2 c, 1 mml-NMMA decreased the response with ∼30% indicating that NO contributed to the chemiluminescent signal via peroxynitrite formation. NO scavenging by superoxide resulting in peroxynitrite production has previously been described in microglia (32Bal-Price A. Matthias A. Brown G.C. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, as superoxide under the conditions used was absolutely required for, and accounted for the majority of the signal, we will for simplicity in the following refer to the chemiluminescent signal as equivalent to superoxide reactivity, although a more complex chemistry lies behind this.For comparison primary rat peritoneal macrophages stimulated under the same conditions (except 600 nm ionomycin was used to avoid toxicity) produced a chemiluminescent signal of similar magnitude as the Ra2-NEF75 microglia (691 ± 53, n = 3versus 660 ± 46 cps, respectively).To be potentially relevant in the context of HIV pathology, the Nef-mediated priming of the microglial NADPH oxidase should also be observed with physiological agonists. Fig.3 shows that Ra2 cells expressing Nef protein demonstrated an enhanced fMLP-induced superoxide release as compared with cells transduced with control vector or the NefG2A mutant.Figure 3Nef expression causes an increased respiratory burst in Ra2 or primary rat microglia following stimulation with Ca2+-signaling physiological agonists. a, Ra2 cells transduced with Nef (solid line), NefG2A (stippled line), or control (LAMP-GFP)-vector (dotted line), were stimulated in suspension with 1 μm fMLP and superoxide release quantitated by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. b, mean and S.D. of three independent experiments carried out as above. The superoxide release of Nef-expressing cells was assigned an arbitrary value of one. c, primary rat microglia were transduced with Nef (solid line) or the NefG2A (stippled line) mutant. Forty-eight hours post-transduction, superoxide production after stimulation with 1 ng/ml LPS was measured by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Panel c shows a representative experiment, while panel d represents mean and S.D. of four independent experiments entailing the use of three different primary microglia purifications.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To ascertain that the observed effect of Nef was not restricted to cell lines, we next examined superoxide production of Nef-transduced primary rat microglia after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Fig. 3,c and d shows that Nef-expressing primary microglia were much more sensitive to LPS than NefG2A-transduced cells.The Nef-mediated Effect Is Not Caused by Increased Levels of NADPH Oxidase SubunitsTo investigate whether Nef caused the observed changes in superoxide production by increasing the steady-state levels of NADPH oxidase components, expression of oxidase subunits was analyzed by Western blotting after Nef transduction. One week after transduction, cells expressed comparable levels of the various phagocyte NADPH oxidase subunits as wild type Ra2 cells, and similarly expression of Rac1 was not altered (Fig.4, a–e).Figure 4Nef-mediated oxidative burst hyper-responsiveness is not caused by increased levels of NADPH oxidase and cannot be reproduced by overexpression of gp91phox. a–e, Ra2 microglia were transduced with Nef or NefG2A and expression levels of cytochromeb 558 subunits p22phox (a) and gp91 phox (b) and cytosolic phox proteins p47phox (c) and p67phox(d), as well as Rac1 (e), were determined by Western blotting and compared with non-transduced Ra2 cells (control). The blots shown are representative of two to four independent experiments. f, Ra2 microglia were transduced with control vector (LAMP-GFP) or human gp91phox. Western blotting of cell lysates shows the expression of human gp91phox, which due to the presence of glycosylation sites not present in rodent gp91phox migrates at a higher molecular weight (arrowhead). A control lysate of human HL60 cells is shown for comparison. g, Ra2 microglia transduced with Nef, gp91phox or control vector (LAMP-GFP) was analyzed by the luminol method for superoxide production subsequent to ionomycin (1 μm in HBSS/Ca2+ 2.3 mm) or PMA (100 ng/ml) stimulation. Mean and S.E. is shown for three independent experiments. Superoxide release of the Nef-expressing cells was assigned an arbitrary value of one.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further investigate this point, we compared the effect of overexpression of the gp91phox subunit (which is held to be rate-limiting for superoxide ouput) with the effect of Nef expression in Ra2 cells. gp91phox-overexpressing cells clearly had a different phenotype; they failed to reproduce the Nef-mediated acquisition of sensitivity to ionomycin (see Fig. 4 g), but significantly increased superoxide production in response to stimulation with saturating PMA concentrations (100 ng/ml). Thus, Nef expression increases the sensitivity of respiratory burst activation to certain stimuli, whereas gp91phox overexpression increases the maximal extent of the respiratory burst.The Effect of Nef Depends on Amino Acid Motifs Critical for Interaction with SH3 Domains and PAKA variety of amino acid motifs within Nef required for interaction with different cellular proteins have been described (3Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The results presented above suggested that the effect of Nef on superoxide production is associated with altered intracellular signaling. To establish and further investigate this point we transduced Ra2 cells with wild type Nef or three different mutants of Nef. As mentioned, the G2A mutant deficient in myristoylation is functionally impaired in most aspects of Nef activity (3Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In the PXXP mutant four proline residues (position 69, 72, 75, and 78) have been exchanged for alanine (25Aiken C. Krause L. Chen Y.L. Trono D. Virology. 1996; 217: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in a motif involved in interaction with cellular SH3 domains, including that of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav (29Fackler O. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A. Peterlin B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the RR106AA and RR106LL mutants two critical arginine residues required for interaction with PAK (33Sawai E.T. Baur A.S. Peterlin B.M. Levy J.A. Cheng-Mayer C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15307-15314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have been exchanged with alanine or leucine, respectively. None of these mutants were able to reproduce the wild type Nef-mediated enhancement of the ionomycin-elicited superoxide response (Fig. 5). Similarly, these Nef mutants also did not enhance the respiratory burst of primary microglia (data not shown). These results raise the possibility that the Nef-mediated priming of the NADPH oxidase involves activation of Vav and PAK. This hypothesis is also attractive, as Vav could activate Rac1, which in turn is thought to interact with the phagocyte NADPH oxidase.Figure 5The effect of Nef is critically dependent on amino acid motifs known to be involved in membrane attachment and interaction with Vav and PAK. a, schematic representation of the amino acids altered in the Nef mutants; NefG2A, NefPxxP (prolines 69, 72, 75, and 78 exchanged for alanine), NefRR106LL and NefRR106AA. b, Ra2 microglia were transduced with empty vector, the above mentioned mutants or Nef wild type. Efficiency of transduction was verified by Western blotting with anti-Nef monoclonal antibody. c, the transduced Ra2 cells were tested for superoxide-production after stimulation with 1 μm ionomycin in HBSS/Ca2+ 2.3 mm.

Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 19Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), we next examined whether Nef mediated activation of Rac1. Rac1 needs to be isoprenylated in order to be functional. In a first approach, we therefore investigated the effect of inhibition of isoprenylation on the Nef enhancement of the respiratory burst. For this purpose, Ra2 cells were preincubated with lovastatin, which inhibits an early step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoid chains (34Bokoch G.M. Prossnitz V. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), followed by stimulation with ionomycin. As shown in Fig.6, a and b, lovastatin caused a dose-dependent decrease of the ionomycin-stimulated superoxide production in Nef-transduced cells. Lovastatin did not cause a redistribution of Nef which retained its punctuate distribution (Fig. 6 c), probably, at least in part, mediated by membrane attachment through the myristoyl chain since the NefG2A mutant is diffusely distributed (compare Fig. 1,c and d). Additionally we investigated superoxide release after preincubation of Ra2 cells with C. difficiletoxin B, which specifically inactivates Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 GTPases by glycosylation of critical amino acids in the effector region (35Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). An overnight incubation with low doses of toxin B blocked the ionomycin-induced superoxide release in Nef-expressing cells (Fig.6 d). At a concentration of 250 pm, which was sufficient to cause rounding of most cells (but not cell death), toxin B reduced the signal to 14.3 ± 6.2% of control values. This toxin B concentration is higher (10–100-fold) than usually employed in the literature, and most likely correlates with the known higher resistance of myeloid cells for the toxin. At a concentration of 2.5 pm no morphological alterations were observed while the chemiluminescent signal was suppressed with ∼50%.Nef Interacts with Vav and Mediates Activation of Rac1 in MicrogliaIn fibroblasts it has been demonstrated that Nef binds and activates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav (29Fackler O. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A. Peterlin B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility Vav immunoprecipitates were analyzed for Nef by Western blotting. Fig.7 a shows that Vav specifically co-immunoprecipitated Nef but not the NefG2A antigen from Ra2 cell lysates, suggesting an interaction between Vav and Nef in the microglia cells.Figure 7Nef interacts with Vav and causes activation of Rac1. a, Vav immunoprecipitates from NefG2A or Nef-expressing cells were Western blotted with monoclonal antibodies to Vav (upper panel) or Nef antigen (lower panel). b, GTP-loaded Rac1 or Cdc42 was pulled-down from lysates prepared from Nef, NefG2A or control (empty vector) transduced Ra2 cells with the GST-fused Rac1-binding domain of PAK (PAK-CRIB) and subsequently Western blotted with antibodies to Rac1 or Cdc42. The upper panels show precipitated Rac1-GTP or Cdc42-GTP (35 × 106 cell equivalents) whereas the lower panelshows aliquots of supernatant (2 × 106 cell equivalents) representing Rac1-GDP or Cdc42-GDP. Positive controls for Cdc42-GTP were obtained by stimulating cells overnight with 2 nm CNF1, or allowing phagocytosis of IgG-zymosan (Z-IgG) to proceed for 10 min. The blots are representative of 2–4 independent experiments. c, NefG2A and Nef-transduced Ra2 cells were incubated on ice with saponin to extract the soluble pool of Rac1, and then incubated with anti-Rac1 antibody before fixation and addition of Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. The overlaypanel shows counterstaining of nuclei with DAPI to demonstrate the peripheral plasma membrane-associated distribution of Rac1.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To explore whether Nef mediated activation of Rac1 we utilized the so-called PAK-CRIB pull-down assay. In this assay, GTP-loaded Rac1 is specifically bound and precipitated by the Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB) domain of PAK expressed as a GST fusion protein (28Sander E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 b shows that while there was no major difference between NefG2A and control-transduced cells, the fraction of active Rac1 was increased significantly in Nef-expressing cells compared with the NefG2A cells (in four independent experiments there was a a 2.4 ± 0.5-fold increase by densitometric scanning). It is believed that Vav carries out guanine nucleotide exchange on Rac1 but not Cdc42 (36Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and therefore we also examined the effect of Nef expression on the activation status of Cdc42. As shown (Fig. 7 b) Cdc42-GTP was undetectable regardless of Nef expression, indicating that Nef specifically activated Rac1. As positive controls for Cdc42 activation, Ra2 cells were stimulated with either IgG-opsonized zymosan (37Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), or cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), which activates Rho family GTPases by deamidation of catalytic amino acid residues (38Boquet P.

To confirm an increased pool of active Rac1 in Nef-expressing cells by an independent technique we made use of a morphological translocation assay to assess Nef-mediated Rac1 recruitment to membranes. For this purpose, live cells were permeabilized with low concentrations of saponin to wash away the cytosolic pool of Rac1. After extraction, membrane-localized Rac1 was then visualized with anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibodies. As seen in Fig. 7 c there was a marked increase in membrane-associated Rac1 in the Nef-expressing cells (mean integrated pixel intensity of 25 randomly selected fields showed a 5-fold increase).Constitutively Active Rac1 Partially Mimics the Nef EffectIf the priming effect of Nef on superoxide generation is predominantly mediated through Rac1 activation, expression of"
https://openalex.org/W1987359603,"Mcm, which is composed of six structurally related subunits (Mcm2–7), is essential for eukaryotic DNA replication. A subassembly of Mcm, the Mcm4/6/7 double-trimeric complex, possesses DNA helicase activity, and it has been proposed that Mcm may function as a replicative helicase at replication forks. We show here that conserved ATPase motifs of Mcm7 are essential for ATPase and DNA helicase activities of the Mcm4/6/7 complex. Because uncomplexed Mcm7 displayed neither ATPase nor DNA helicase activity, Mcm7 contributes to the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm complex through interaction with other subunits. In contrast, the Mcm4/6/7 complex containing a zinc finger mutant of Mcm4 with partially impaired DNA binding activity exhibited elevated DNA helicase activity. The Mcm4/6/7 complex containing this Mcm4 mutant tended to dissociate into trimeric complexes, suggesting that the zinc finger of Mcm4 is involved in subunit interactions of trimers. The Mcm4 mutants lacking the N-terminal 35 or 112 amino acids could form hexameric Mcm4/6/7 complexes, but displayed very little DNA helicase activity. In conjunction with the previously reported essential role of Mcm6 in ATP binding (You, Z., Komamura, Y., and Ishimi, Y. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol.19, 8003–8015), our data indicate distinct roles of Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7 subunits in activation of the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4/6/7 complex. Mcm, which is composed of six structurally related subunits (Mcm2–7), is essential for eukaryotic DNA replication. A subassembly of Mcm, the Mcm4/6/7 double-trimeric complex, possesses DNA helicase activity, and it has been proposed that Mcm may function as a replicative helicase at replication forks. We show here that conserved ATPase motifs of Mcm7 are essential for ATPase and DNA helicase activities of the Mcm4/6/7 complex. Because uncomplexed Mcm7 displayed neither ATPase nor DNA helicase activity, Mcm7 contributes to the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm complex through interaction with other subunits. In contrast, the Mcm4/6/7 complex containing a zinc finger mutant of Mcm4 with partially impaired DNA binding activity exhibited elevated DNA helicase activity. The Mcm4/6/7 complex containing this Mcm4 mutant tended to dissociate into trimeric complexes, suggesting that the zinc finger of Mcm4 is involved in subunit interactions of trimers. The Mcm4 mutants lacking the N-terminal 35 or 112 amino acids could form hexameric Mcm4/6/7 complexes, but displayed very little DNA helicase activity. In conjunction with the previously reported essential role of Mcm6 in ATP binding (You, Z., Komamura, Y., and Ishimi, Y. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol.19, 8003–8015), our data indicate distinct roles of Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7 subunits in activation of the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4/6/7 complex. single-stranded DNA dithiothreitol β,γ-imidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate DNA helicase plays a central role in the replication of chromosomal DNA. It couples the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to separation of a DNA duplex into its component strands. DNA helicase is associated with a set of subactivities including DNA binding, nucleotide binding, and ATP hydrolysis, all of which cooperatively work for DNA unwinding (1Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 2Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The Mcm family proteins (Mcm2–7) interact with one another to form a complex that plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication (3Tye B.K. Annu. Rev.

A recent demonstration that the Mcm4/6/7 complex can form a hexameric complex with active helicase activity suggests that the Mcm complex may be part of the replicative DNA helicase of eukaryotes (8Ishimi Y.

All six Mcm proteins contain DNA-dependent ATPase motifs in their central domains, including Walker motifs A and B, which are widely conserved in ATPases and DNA helicases (14Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 15Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In addition, four of the Mcm proteins (Mcm2, Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7) contain a zinc finger motif, which may function in protein-protein interactions or nucleic acid binding (3Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 16Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The ATPase and zinc finger motifs are highly conserved in Mcm proteins from yeast to mammalian cells, suggesting their crucial roles in the functions of Mcm. We have identified DNA helicase activity in the human Mcm4/6/7 protein complex (8Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and subsequently demonstrated that it is intrinsic to mammalian Mcm4/6/7 complexes (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DNA helicase activity was also demonstrated in the Mcm4/6/7 complex of fission yeast (10Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of the DNA helicase functions of the Mcm4/6/7 complex and to obtain insight into the physiological significance of this activity, biochemical studies with a series of mutants of the Mcm4/6/7 complex were undertaken. Our previous studies with mutant Mcm4/6/7 complexes in which the ATP-binding motifs of the Mcm6 protein were mutated showed that the mutation preferentially affected the high affinity binding of ATP and inactivated the DNA helicase activity, although the ATPase activity was not significantly affected. A mutation in an ATP-binding motif of the Mcm4 protein affected the ssDNA1 binding activity of the complex and led to moderate inhibition of the DNA helicase activity (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the present study, the roles of ATP-binding motifs of Mcm7 and those of the zinc finger motif of Mcm4 in various activities of the Mcm4/6/7 complex were examined. Our results indicate that ATPase motifs of Mcm7 are essential for the ATP hydrolytic and DNA helicase activities of the Mcm4/6/7 complex, whereas Mcm7 alone does not possess these activities, and that zinc finger motif mutants of Mcm4 display enhanced DNA helicase activity, with altered subunit assembly and partially impaired DNA binding activity. We have shown that the N-terminal region of the Mcm4 protein is also required for DNA helicase activity. Our results indicate distinct roles of each subunit of the Mcm4/6/7 complex in the execution of its helicase activity. A possible model of the helicase action of Mcm is discussed on the basis of these findings. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Mcm7 andMcm4 genes was conducted with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotides 5′-GGCGTGTGCTGCATTGCTGCGTTTGACAAGATGGCC-3′ and 5′-GACCCTGGTGTGGCCGCAGCTCAGCTCCTATCTTAC-3′ were used as primers to prepare the histidine-tagged Mcm7DE and Mcm7KS mutants (where “DE” refers to the Asp444 and Glu445 residues in the Walker B motif mutated to alanine, and “KS” refers to the highly conserved Lys386 and Ser387 residues in the Walker A motif mutated to alanine), respectively, in pBluescript II SK(−). The oligonucleotides 5′-GAGGCCTTTTTCCAAGCCCAAGTCGCTGCCCACACCACCCGG-3′ and 5′-GCTGAGCCCTGCAGTGCTGTGCACGCCCACACTACCCACAGC-3′ were used as primers to introduce Cys-to-Ala mutations at amino acids 305 and 308 and amino acids 327 and 330 of Mcm4 in pBluescript II SK(−), resulting in Mcm4CC1 and Mcm4CC2, respectively. Deletion mutants of Mcm4 were generated by PCR amplification. First, to amplify the N-terminal fragments of the Mcm4 gene product (amino acids 35–148 and 112–148 as EcoRI-HindIII fragments), oligonucleotides 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCATGGGACATCATCATCATCATCACGGAAGACGTAGAGGCGAAGATTC-3′ and 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCATGGGACATCATCATCATCATCACGGACAGAGGCCAGATCTGGGCTC-3′, respectively, in combination with 5′-TTACATGTTGCCACATTCAC-3′ were used as primers. The amplified fragments were digested withEcoRI plus HindIII and ligated to the Mcm4 C-terminal fragment (amino acids 149–862), resulting in Mcm4ΔN35 and Mcm4ΔN112, respectively. The mutagenized His6-Mcm7 genes were subcloned into the pAcUW31 vector (Pharmingen) bearing wild-type Mcm2. Similarly, the mutant His6-Mcm4 genes were cloned into the same vector bearing full-length Mcm6 (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of all the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing with an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. Mcm complexes containing Mcm7 mutants were expressed in HighFive insect cells by co-infection of Mcm2/7KS or Mcm2/7DE together with wild-type Mcm4/6 (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The mutant Mcm4/6/7 complexes were purified by nickel column chromatography, histone-Sepharose column chromatography, and glycerol gradient centrifugation as described previously (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The Mcm4CC1/6/7 or Mcm4CC2/6/7 complex was similarly expressed in HighFive cells after co-infection of FLAG-tagged Mcm7 with Mcm4CC1/6 or Mcm4CC2/6 and was purified by consecutive steps involving Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose affinity chromatography, and glycerol gradient centrifugation. On the nitrilotriacetic acid column, proteins bound to the beads were eluted three times by adding 1 bed volume of buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol supplemented with 200 mm imidazole (pH 7.5). The eluted fractions were mixed with anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose beads (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 300 mmNaCl, and 10% glycerol) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rocking platform. After washing the resin three times with 10 bed volumes of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted three times by incubation at 4 °C for 15 min with 1 bed volume of buffer A containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluted fractions were pooled and further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 16 h (Beckman TLS55 rotor) on a 15–35% linear glycerol gradient as described previously (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or on a Mono Q column in a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) in which the peak fractions containing the zinc finger mutant complexes eluted at 0.3 m NaCl. The presence of a FLAG tag at the C terminus of Mcm7 did not affect various biochemical functions of the Mcm4/6/7 complex. The FLAG-tagged Mcm7 protein, singly expressed in insect cells, was purified by consecutive steps involving anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose affinity chromatography, Mono Q column chromatography, a second run of anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose affinity chromatography, and finally 15–35% glycerol gradient centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 16 h. A 17-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′; Takara Biomedical, Tokyo, Japan) was labeled at the 5′-end with polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA (Takara Biomedical). The annealed labeled substrate was purified on a Quantum Prep PCR Kleen spin column (Bio-Rad). Approximately 5–10 fmol of substrate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with the indicated amounts of Mcm proteins in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 10 mm ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as described previously (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The conditions for ATPase assays were the same as for DNA helicase assays, except that the substrate was omitted, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of heated-denatured salmon sperm DNA or 0.75 μg of 67-mer oligonucleotide were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, aliquots (0.5 μl) were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, and the ATP and Piwere separated by chromatography in 1 m formic acid and 0.5m LiCl. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was quantified by using a Fuji BAS 2500 Bio-Image analyzer. Mcm proteins were incubated with the labeled 37-mer oligonucleotide (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in buffer containing 10 mm sodium creatine phosphate, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 15 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.5) for 30 min. Glutaraldehyde (10%) was then added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 0.1%, and the incubation was continued for 10 min. The reaction mixture was applied to 5% native polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine buffer. We did not observe any effect of the presence of ATP on the gel shift patterns of the Mcm complexes under the conditions employed. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were conducted as previously described (10Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (15 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaOAc, 10 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm AMP-PNP, and 20 fmol of 5′-end-labeled 37-mer oligonucleotide. Proteins were added, and reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures, diluted by addition of 85 μl of wash buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaOAc, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, and 1 mm DTT), were filtered through alkaline-treated 0.45-μm HA nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) (17McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The filters were washed three times with wash buffer, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. ATP binding assays were conducted as previously described (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mouse wild-type Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7 and mutants Mcm4CC1 and Mcm4CC2 were cloned into the pBluescript II plasmid (Stratagene). Mcm proteins were synthesized on these template DNAs in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine in the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) as suggested by the manufacturer. The reaction mixture was diluted with 400 μl of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m sodium glutamate, 2 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then concentrated to 50 μl using a Microcon-10 column (Amicon, Inc.). This procedure removed free [35S]methionine from the reaction mixtures. The TnT product of Mcm4 (wild-type or mutant) was mixed with an equal amount of Mcm6 or Mcm7, diluted to 30 μl with buffer B containing 1 mm DTT, and then incubated with 1 μl of anti-mouse Mcm4 antibody (serum generously provided by Dr. Hiroshi Kimura) at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose (15 μl; AmershamBiosciences) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. Immunocomplexes were washed five times with buffer B containing 1 mm DTT; the bound and unbound proteins were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; and the radioactivity on the gel was analyzed with the Fuji Bio-Image analyzer. Two mutations that changed specific amino acids located in the well conserved DNA-dependent ATPase motifs of Mcm7 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.1). The highly conserved lysine and serine residues (KS) in the Walker A motif and the aspartic and glutamic acid residues (DE) in the Walker B motif were changed to alanine in the Mcm7 protein (Mcm7DE and Mcm7KS, respectively). These amino acids have been implicated in the nucleotide hydrolytic and DNA unwinding activities of various ATPases and DNA helicases (18Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol.

To express these mutant Mcm4/6/7 proteins, HighFive insect cells were co-infected with two recombinant baculoviruses, Mcm2/His6-Mcm7 (DE or KS) and His6-Mcm4/6. The mutant Mcm4/6/7 complexes were purified to near homogeneity by Ni2+-agarose chromatography, histone H3/H4-Sepharose column chromatography (23Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and glycerol gradient centrifugation (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) as described previously (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Mcm4/6/7 complexes containing an Mcm7 Walker A or B motif mutant. The histone-Sepharose fractions containing mutant Mcm4/6/7 proteins were pooled and further fractionated by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated by Microcon-30 centrifugation. The final preparations containing purified proteins were analyzed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (59:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) (A) or on 5% native acrylamide gel (79:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) (C), followed by silver staining. Western blotting was conducted to estimate the amount of each subunit present in the purified fractions with antibodies against the proteins indicated (B). Lane 1, Mcm4/6/7DE (30 ng); lane 2, Mcm4/6/7KS (30 ng); lane 3, wild-type (WT) Mcm4/6/7 (30 ng); lane 4, Mcm2/4/6/7 (40 ng). Depending on the conditions of electrophoresis, the Mcm7 protein appeared as two bands upon SDS-PAGE. They may be generated from modification of the protein or from alternative initiation of translation. The Mcm7 protein was more strongly silver-stained than the other subunits. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining showed a roughly stoichiometric presence of each subunit (data not shown).Thy, thyroglobulin; Fer, ferritin;Cat, catalase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Glycerol gradient sedimentation indicated that the mutant complexes sedimented at ∼550 kDa, a value almost identical to that of the wild-type complex (data not shown). Examination of the purified proteins by SDS-PAGE revealed that the three subunits largely formed stoichiometric complexes in both mutants (Fig. 2 A). The levels of contaminating Mcm2 protein in the purified Mcm4/6/7 complexes were examined by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B). The results show that the amounts of Mcm2 protein present in the Mcm4/6/7 complexes were similar in the wild-type and mutant Mcm7 proteins and were <5% of the amount present in the helicase-inactive Mcm2/4/6/7 complex containing the same amounts of Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7 subunits (Fig.2 B, upper panel) (data not shown). This level of Mcm2 does not inhibit the helicase activity of the Mcm4/6/7 complex (9You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Analyses of the mutant complexes on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel indicated that they predominantly existed as hexameric complexes, like the wild-type complex (Fig. 2 C), indicating that complex formation is not affected by the Mcm7 mutations. We then characterized the biochemical properties of the mutant complexes. The mutations resulted in almost no (Mcm4/6/7KS) or significantly reduced (Mcm4/6/7DE) DNA helicase activity (Fig. 3 A). The levels of ATPase activities of the mutant complexes were also significantly lower than that of the wild-type Mcm4/6/7 complex (Fig. 3 B). However, they retained ssDNA and ATP binding activities that were nearly comparable to those detected with the wild-type complex (Fig. 3,C and D). The above results indicate that ATPase motifs of Mcm7 are essential for the DNA helicase and ATP hydrolytic activities expressed by the Mcm4/6/7 complex. The above results suggest that Mcm7 may directly contribute to the DNA helicase and ATPase activities of the Mcm4/6/7 complex. Therefore, we examined whether a single polypeptide of the Mcm7 protein possesses ATP hydrolytic and DNA helicase activities. The Mcm7 protein fraction obtained after three steps of purification (see “Experimental Procedures”) was further fractionated by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The proteins in these fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 A). The major peak of the Mcm7 protein sedimented at fractions close to catalase (230 kDa), indicating that Mcm7 may form a trimeric complex. The ATPase and DNA helicase activities were then measured using this purified protein fraction. As shown in Fig. 4 (B and C), neither ATPase nor DNA helicase activity was detected in the Mcm7 protein preparations. These results indicate that Mcm7 itself is deficient in ATP hydrolytic and DNA helicase activities and suggest that it may contribute to the DNA helicase and ATPase activities of the Mcm4/6/7 complex through interacting with other subunits. Four of the six Mcm subunits (Mcm2, Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7) contain a conserved zinc finger motif (C X 2C X 18C X 2C), suggesting that they may be involved in protein-protein interactions, protein folding stability, or DNA-protein interactions (24Perrier V.

Biol. 2000; 4: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles of the zinc finger motif of the Mcm4 protein in the biochemical activities of the Mcm4/6/7 complex, we replaced the first or second pair of cysteines in Mcm4 with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed it as an Mcm4/6/7 complex (Mcm4CC1/6/7 or Mcm4CC2/6/7, respectively) (Fig. 1). These mutant complexes, carrying a histidine tag and a FLAG tag at the N terminus of Mcm4 and at the C terminus of Mcm7, respectively, were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography, FLAG affinity column chromatography, and glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig.5 A).Figure 5Mutations in the zinc finger motif of the Mcm4 protein in the Mcm4/6/7 complex result in unstable hexamers, reduced ssDNA binding activity, and increased DNA helicase activity. A, the wild-type (WT) Mcm4/6/7 (left panels) and Mcm4CC2/6/7 (right panels) complexes, purified on nickel and anti-FLAG antibody affinity columns, were separated by 15–30% glycerol gradient centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each fraction was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide; upper left panel), 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (59:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide; upper right panel), or 5% native polyacrylamide gel (lower panels); and proteins were stained with silver. B, the wild-type (WT) and mutant Mcm4, Mcm6, and Mcm7 proteins were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. Approximately the same amounts of Mcm4 and Mcm6 (upper panels) or Mcm4 and Mcm7 (lower panels) were mixed as indicated, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-Mcm4 antibody. Input (15% of total) and bound proteins were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide), and proteins were detected by autoradiography. C, the final preparations of the wild-type and zinc finger mutants of Mcm4/6/7 (150 ng each), used in the various assays described for D–G, were prepared by concentrating glycerol gradient peak fractions (wild-type complex, pool of fractions 3–5; and zinc finger mutant complex, pool of fractions 6–8) and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining. D, ATPase assays were conducted under the standard conditions with various amounts of a zinc finger mutant (Mcm4CC2/6/7) or the wild-type Mcm4/6/7 complex as indicated. The reactions contained a 67-mer oligonucleotide DNA at 50 ng/μl. The released phosphate (Pi in pmol; the background in the absence of added protein was taken as 0) was quantified, and the values are presented at the bottom of each lane. E, the ssDNA binding activities of the wild-type and zinc finger mutant Mcm4/6/7 complexes were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The gray arrow indicates the position of the Mcm4/6/7 hexamer (550 kDa) in complex with the 37-mer DNA. The positions of protein molecular mass markers (Thy, thyroglobulin; Fer, ferritin) upon glycerol gradient and native gel electrophoresis are indicated byblack arrows. The protein-free oligonucleotides have run off the gel. The intensities of the shifted bands were quantified, and the relative extent of binding, with the intensity of the shifted DNA with 50 ng of the wild-type protein being taken as 100, is presented below each lane. F, nitrocellulose filter binding assays of the wild-type and mutant Mcm4/6/7 complexes were conducted with 20 fmol of labeled 37-mer oligonucleotide. The amounts of DNA-protein complexes generated are plotted against the concentration of Mcm proteins. The values are the averages of three independent experiments, anderror bars are shown. G, the DNA helicase activities of the zinc finger mutant Mcm4/6/7 complexes, as indicated, were measured along with the wild-type complex as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The displaced oligonucleotides (%) were quantified and are plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The wild-type Mcm4/6/7 complex sedimented at 500–600 kDa, whereas the Mcm4CC2/6/7 complex peaked at fractions slightly larger than catalase (232 kDa) (Fig. 5 A, upper panels). Examination of each fraction on a nondenaturing acrylamide gel revealed that the mutant complex contained a significant amount of 280-kDa trimers, whereas the wild-type complex was almost exclusively composed of 550-kDa hexameric complexes (Fig. 5 A, lower panels). Similar results were obtained with the Mcm4CC1/6/7 complex (data not shown). These results indicate that mutations in the zinc finger result in disassembly of the hexameric complex into trimers. Therefore, the zinc finger motif of Mcm4 is likely to be involved in the stable assembly of the hexameric structure. To address the molecular basis of the instability of the Mcm4/6/7 hexamer containing an Mcm4 zinc finger mutant, we examined the interaction of wild-type or mutant Mcm4 with Mcm6 and Mcm7. Whenin vitro synthesized wild-type Mcm4 was mixed with Mcm6 or Mcm7 similarly synthesized in vitro, anti-Mcm4 antibody efficiently immunoprecipitated Mcm6 or Mcm7, respectively (Fig.5 B, lane 2). Approximately 20% of the input Mcm6 and Mcm7 was immunoprecipitated. Lower bands in the bound fraction may be degradation products of Mcm4. These results indicate that Mcm4 interacts with both Mcm6 and Mcm7 under our experimental conditions. The Mcm6 and Mcm7 proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant Mcm4 proteins with similar efficiency (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the zinc finger mutations of Mcm4 do not affect its interaction with the Mcm6 or Mcm7 protein. We speculate that they may alter the overall structure of the Mcm4/6/7 protein, thus affecting the dimerization of the Mcm4/6/7 trimeric complex. The purified Mcm4/6/7 complexes containing the zinc finger mutants contained the three subunits at a stoichiometry identical to that of the wild-type complex, as judged by SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 5 C). The two zinc finger mutant Mcm4/6/7 complexes retained the DNA-dependent ATPase activities at a level comparable to that of the wild-type complex in the presence of ssDNA (Fig. 5 D) (data no"

Ten mutant proteins were heterologously produced inPichia pastoris, and their biochemical properties and kinetic parameters were determined. The specific activity of the Y6A, Y10A, Y89A, Y164A, and W172A mutant enzymes was drastically reduced. The low specific activities of Y6A and Y89A were entirely accounted for by a change in k cat and K m, respectively, whereas the lower values of Y10A, Y164A, and W172A were due to a combination of increased K m and decreasedk cat. Tyr6, Tyr10, Tyr89, Tyr164, and Trp172 are proposed as substrate-binding residues, a finding consistent with structural sequence alignments of family 11 xylanases and with the three-dimensional structure of the A. niger xylanase in complex with the modeled xylobiose. All other variants, D113A, D113N, N117A, E118A, and E118Q, retained full wild-type activity. Only N117A lost its sensitivity toxylanase inhibitor protein I (XIP-I), a protein inhibitor isolated from wheat, and this mutation did not affect the fold of the xylanase as revealed by circular dichroism. The N117A variant showed kinetics, pH stability, hydrolysis products pattern, substrate specificity, and structural properties identical to that of the wild-type xylanase. The loss of inhibition, as measured in activity assays, was due to abolition of the interaction between XIP-I and the mutant enzyme, as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance and electrophoretic titration. A close inspection of the three-dimensional structure of A. niger xylanase suggests that the binding site of XIP-I is located at the conserved “thumb” hairpin loop of family 11 xylanases.

Endo-(1,4)-β-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) depolymerize the xylan backbone by cleaving the β-(1,4) glycosidic bonds betweend-xylose residues in the main chain to produce short xylooligosaccharides (1Biely P.

The two families have different molecular structures, molecular weights, and catalytic properties (6Jeffries T.W. Curr. Opin.

This proceeds via a double displacement mechanism in which a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate is formed in the glycosylation step and subsequently hydrolyzed in the deglycosylation step via transition states including substrate distortion and electrophilic migration of C1 (9McCarter J.D.

All reported structures of family 11 endoxylanases present one single (catalytic) domain with an all-β-strand “sandwich-like” fold containing two β-sheets forming a large cleft that can accommodate the xylan polymers.

They are monomeric glycosylated proteins with molecular masses of ∼29 kDa and pI values of 8.7–8.9. The second type are the T riticumaestivum L. xylanase inhibitor (TAXI)-like inhibitors (36Debyser W. Peumans W.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Delcour J.A. J. Cereal Sci. 1999; 30: 39-43Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). They are high pI, nonglycosylated proteins with molecular masses of ∼40 kDa. At least two inhibitors of this type (TAXI I and TAXI II) with different pI values (8.8 and ∼9.3, respectively) and varying specificities toward different endoxylanases have been identified in wheat (46Gebruers K. Debyser W. Goesaert H. Proost P. Van Damme J. Delcour J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of TAXI-I and TAXI-II showed a high degree of identity, but there was no similarity to XIP-I. The TAXI-like inhibitors are believed to be active against bacterial and fungal family 11 endoxylanases but not against family 10 endoxylanases (46Gebruers K. Debyser W. Goesaert H. Proost P.

XIP-I inhibited both family-10 and 11 fungal xylanases apart from the family 10Aspergillus aculeatus xylanase with K ivalues ranging from 3.4 to 610 nm, but bacterial family 10 and 11 xylanases were not inhibited (48Flatman R.

J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have previously reported the production and characterization of theA. niger xylanase in Pichia pastoris and shown that the recombinant enzyme was similar to the native enzyme and was competitively inhibited by XIP-I with a K i = 350 nm (33Berrin J.G. Williamson G. Puigserver A. Chaix J.C. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 48Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C.S. Berrin J.G. Hughes R.K. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chosen strategy for mutational analysis ofA. niger xylanase took advantage of data available on theA. niger xylanase-XIP-I complex such as (a) kinetics of inhibition, (b) titration curves, (c) isothermal calorimetry data, and also the availability of (d) the three-dimensional structure of A. nigerxylanase (Protein Data Bank code 1UKR) and (e) an efficient heterologous system for expression of A. niger xylanase. The inhibition mechanism of XIP-I against family 11 fungal A. niger xylanase has been studied in detail (48Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C.S. Berrin J.G. Hughes R.K. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition is pH-dependent in the range of 4 to 7 as determined by activity assays and titration curves, illustrating the importance of electrostatic interactions in the strength of the interaction. Moreover, isothermal titration calorimetry of the XIP-I:A. niger xylanase complex showed the formation of a complex with a stoichiometry of (1:1) and a heat capacity change of −1.38 kJ/mol, suggesting that the interaction was enthalpy-driven (48Flatman R. McLauchlan W.R. Juge N. Furniss C.S. Berrin J.G. Hughes R.K. Manzanares P. Ladbury J.E. O'Brien R. Williamson G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 773-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aromatic and charged amino acids are believed to play a pivotal role in protein-protein interactions by forming hydrophobic stacking and electrostatic interactions, respectively, with the target ligand. Because the inhibition is competitive, residues were selected near the active site. The three-dimensional structure of the A. nigerxylanase revealed several aromatic and charged residues (Tyr6, Tyr10, Tyr89, Asp113, Asn117, Asp118, Tyr164, and Trp172) on the surface around the binding cleft. The structural analysis of the enzyme showed that these target residues are not part of the hydrogen bond network in the vicinity of the two catalytic residues (Glu79 and Glu170) (24Krengle U. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of these residues in binding to XIP-I, appropriate mutations in the xylanase were constructed, and the biochemical properties of the mutated enzymes were evaluated in terms of kinetic properties and ability to interact with XIP-I.Our results indicate that Asn117 is critical for the XIP-I binding capacity of the enzyme. The mutational analysis also allowed a better understanding of the role of individual residues involved in a number of subsites in the active-site cleft of a family 11 glycosyl hydrolase.DISCUSSIONThe active site of glycosyl hydrolases often contain aromatic residues, such as tyrosine and tryptophan, which hydrophobically stack against sugar rings, as well as side chains, which hydrogen bind to hydroxyl groups of the substrate. The replacement of the aromatic amino acid residues, Tyr6, Tyr10, Tyr89, Tyr164, and Trp172 with Ala significantly reduced the enzyme activity of A. niger glycosyl hydrolase family 11 xylanase. These mutations did not affect the fold of the xylanase as revealed by circular dichroism spectra of these variants. Although these residues are not essential for the hydrolytic reactionper se (24Krengle U. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the present findings indicate that they play an important role in ligand binding and catalysis.In family 11 xylanases, the resolution of a limited number of structures of enzyme-ligand complexes has revealed several active site residues that have the potential to play key roles in the interaction of subsites with xylose moieties. The structure of a catalytically inactive Bacillus circulans xylanase (BCX) mutant incubated with xylotetraose has been characterized, but only a portion of the ligand (a xylobiose moiety) could be observed at the active site (subsites −1 and −2) (13Wakarchuk W.W.

Recently the structure of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate has been obtained providing more insight into the −1 subsite (30Sidhu G. Withers S.G. Nguyen N.T. McIntosh L.P. Ziser L. Brayer G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To evaluate the number of subsites in the active site of Trichoderma reesei xylanases, different xylo-oligomer models were docked to the active site of both XYNI and XYNII (22Törrönen A. Rouvinen J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). XYNI probably has space for three subsites (−2, −1, +1), whereas the active site of XYNII is longer and may have five subsites (−2, −1, +1, +2, +3). Structures of covalently attached epoxyalkyl glycosides to the active site residues of XYNII are also available, but these include only one xylose residue (29Havukainen R. Törrönen A. Laitinen T. Rouvinen J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9617-9624Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Modeling studies with a xyloheptaose in the active site of Thermomyces lanuginosusxylanase (XynA) identify residues involved in subsite −2 (26Gruber K. Klintschar G. Hayn M. Schlacher A. Steiner W. Kratky C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13475-13485Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently the structure of an inactive mutant of the Xyn11 fromBacillus agaradhaerens in complex with xylotriose has been obtained (17Sabini E. Wilson K.S. Danielsen S. Schulein M. Davies G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The interactions are very similar to that described at subsites −2 and −1 for the covalent intermediate complex (16Sabini E. Sulzenbacher G. Dauter M. Dauter Z. Jorgensen P.L. Schulein M. Dupont C. Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), with the addition of the interactions for the −3 subsite.The active site residues in the A. niger xylanase correspond remarkably closely in both position and orientation with the residues that contact the sugar rings in these complexes. In Fig.5, structural alignment of the above xylanases with that of A. niger enzyme showed that four of the A. niger xylanase variants (Y10A, Y89A, Y164A, and W172A) have been mutated at positions corresponding to residues that have been involved in discrete subsites of other family 11 xylanases. Tyr10 corresponds to Trp9BCX, Tyr9XYNI, Trp18XYNII, Trp18XynA, and Trp19Xyn11, all involved in stacking interaction with the xylose ring in substite −2 of these xylanases (13Wakarchuk W.W.

Tyr89 corresponds to Tyr96XYNII thought to determine subsite +3 of the Trichoderma reseei enzyme (22Törrönen A. Rouvinen J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Tyr164 is equivalent to Tyr166BCXand Tyr172XynA, both shown to form hydrogen bonds with the substrate in subsite −2 of the xylanases (13Wakarchuk W.W. Campbell R.L. Sung W.L. Davoodi J. Yaguchi M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 26Gruber K. Klintschar G. Hayn M. Schlacher A. Steiner W. Kratky C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13475-13485Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Trp172 corresponds to Trp166XYNIand Tyr179XYNII, which are thought to determine subsites +1 and +2 of XYNI and XYNII enzyme, respectively (22Törrönen A. Rouvinen J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Moreover, the oxygen atom OH of residue Tyr6 is in the same position as atom Glu17Xyn11 OE1 (not shown), which, in B. agaradhaerens, is involved in one of the solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds associating the −3 substite sugar (17Sabini E. Wilson K.S. Danielsen S. Schulein M. Davies G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1344-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the substantial decrease in the activity of the Y6A, Y10A, Y89A, Y164A, and W172A mutants against xylan, although these residues do not necessarily play equivalent roles in different family 11 enzymes. In Fig.6, the two xylose rings found at substites −1 and −2 of the BCX mutant complexed with a substrate (13Wakarchuk W.W. Campbell R.L. Sung W.L. Davoodi J. Yaguchi M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) are superimposed to the A. niger xylanase three-dimensional structure. In this view Tyr6, Tyr10, and Tyr164 are in close contact with the ligand, also suggesting their involvement in substites of the A. nigerenzyme. Mutational analyses of active site residues have been carried on other family 11 xylanases, but, to our knowledge, none of the present mutations were reported apart from Tyr166BCX (corresponding to Tyr164in A. niger xylanase), which, replaced by Phe in B. circulans xylanase, led to a small decrease of enzyme activity (13Wakarchuk W.W. Campbell R.L. Sung W.L. Davoodi J. Yaguchi M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The substrate binding cleft of A. niger xylanase contains at least four xylose-binding subsites (24Krengle U. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our data clearly show that Tyr10 and Tyr164 are likely to play an important role in ligand binding in the glycone region of the substrate binding cleft (probably at subsite −2), whereas Trp172 and Tyr89 are involved in the aglycone subsites (probably at subsites +1 and +2, respectively) of A. niger xylanase. Interestingly, the finding that Tyr6played a role in enzyme activity together with its position in the three-dimensional structure might indicate the presence of another subsite (−3) in the substrate binding cleft of A. nigerxylanase.Figure 6Molecular surface representation of theA. niger xylanase active cleft.Two sugar residues have been modeled into the active site by superimposing the structure of B. circulans xylanase complexed with xylobiose (PDB code 1BCX) on top of the A. niger xylanase.

In contrast, xanthophyll cycle carotenoids bound to LHCII trimers had largely lost their in vivo configuration, suggesting their partial dissociation from the binding locus.

Ruban A.V Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 3Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of their action in NPQ is not well understood. Several possibilities have been suggested. One is that zeaxanthin can act as a direct acceptor of excitation energy from PSII antenna chlorophyll, i.e. that it is a direct excitation quencher (4Demmig-Adams B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 1-24Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 5Owens T.G. Shreve A.P. Albrecht A.C. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. 4. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 179-186Google Scholar). The other defines zeaxanthin as an allosteric activator and violaxanthin as an inhibitor of structural changes within the PSII light-harvesting antenna (LHA), triggered by the high levels of ΔpH under strong illumination (2Horton P. Ruban A.V Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 3Horton P. Ruban A.V. Wentworth M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus in order to understand the mechanism of NPQ, knowledge of the location and binding properties of the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids within the PSII antenna is required. The PSII antenna consists of a number of pigment-protein complexes accommodating various amounts of XC carotenoids (6Lee A.L. Thornber J.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 85: 495-502Google Scholar, 7Peter G.F.

This recent work established that a large population of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids is peripherally bound to LHA complexes. A sucrose gradient preparation of an oligomeric LHCII antenna complex, composed of 5–7 trimers, contained a maximum amount of violaxanthin, up to 1 per LHCII monomer, which was readily accessible for deepoxidation. The minor PSII antenna complexes, CP24, CP26, and CP29, are highly enriched in XC carotenoids. The affinity of violaxanthin binding to these complexes was much higher than to LHCII, and the availability for deepoxidation was lower (10Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Recently, we have applied differential resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy to identify the configuration of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in vivo (11Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was found that they adopt very specific configurations in the thylakoid membrane, different from those in organic solvent or detergent micelles. The aim of the current work was to apply this new spectroscopic methodology to study the state of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids in isolated LHCII, CP26, and CP29 in comparison with that in intact PSII membranes. We assess whether the configuration of XC carotenoids correlates with their binding affinity and determine which of the in vitro antenna preparations possesses a xanthophyll configuration similar to that in vivo. We also present a summary and analysis of the nature of the configuration-indicative resonance Raman modes of the four major xanthophylls of the PSII antenna. Comparative analysis of the ν4 region of the Raman spectra for all LHCII-bound xanthophylls allows an assignment of some of the bands to particular molecular domains potentially involved in the interaction with the protein. Thylakoids and PSII-enriched membranes were prepared from dark-adapted spinach leaves as described in Ref. 9Ruban A.V Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiology. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar. To induce maximum violaxanthin deepoxidation, thylakoids were incubated at room temperature at a chlorophyll concentration of 200 μm for 2 h in a medium containing 5 mmd-isoascorbate, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.5 with or without 5 mm Mg2+. Purification of LHCII trimers and oligomers was carried out using sucrose gradient centrifugation of unstacked thylakoids or PSII-particles, solubilized by dodecyl-β-d-maltoside as described previously (10Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Minor antenna complexes, CP26 and CP29, were isolated using preparative isoelectricfocusing (9Ruban A.V Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiology. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Pigment analysis was carried out by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (12Johnson G.N. Scholes J.D. Horton P. Young A.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1993; 16: 681-686Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, freshly prepared samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate and applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated grids. Images were analyzed using a Phillips CM100 electron microscope with an 80 kV accelerating voltage and 52,000 times magnification. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 500 (Varian) double-beam scanning spectrophotometer; measurements at 77 K were performed using an Oxford Optistat (Oxford Instruments). Low temperature resonance Raman spectra were obtained in a helium flow cryostat (Air Liquide) using a Jobin-Yvon U1000 Raman spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device detector (Spectrum One, Jobin-Yvon) as described in Ref. 13Sturgis J.N. Robert B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar. Excitation at 488.0 and 514.5 nm was provided by a Coherent Argon laser (Innova 100). The choice of these wavelengths was determined by the positions of the 0–0 electronic transitions of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin at 488 and 507 nm, respectively (11Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Before the calculation of differences, spectra were normalized to the chlorophyll bands at 1437, 1353, and 1327 cm−1 as described in Ref. 11Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar. Infrared spectroscopy was performed on xanthophylls in the solid state using a Brucker Equinox 50 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer with a 3× reflection ATR sample applicator. Spectral resolution was 8 cm−1. The xanthophyll cycle content of thylakoids and PSII membranes was similar to those obtained previously (TableI) (10Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because of the gentle detergent treatment used, LHCII oligomers and trimers were found to contain around 20% xanthophyll cycle carotenoid of a total carotenoid content, whereas CP26 and CP29 exhibited even higher xanthophyll cycle content. The deepoxidation efficiency was nearly 80% in low pH-treated unstacked thylakoids and around 60% for PSII membranes prepared from light-treated leaves. Very high deepoxidation rates were found for LHCII oligomers and trimers, whereas significantly lower values were observed for CP26 and particularly CP29.Table IXanthophyll cycle composition in various preparations of thylakoid membranes and pigment-protein complexes of photosystem II expressed as a percentage of a total carotenoid contentXC/%DES/%aDES, deepoxidation state, calculated as (Zea + 0.5 Ant)/(Zea + Ant + Vio).Vio/%Ant/%Zea/%Thylakoids+ Vio24.4 ± 1.22.3 ± 1.122.0 ± 1.11.4 ± 0.70.0 ± 0+ Zea26.1 ± 2.078.0 ± 1.05.0 ± 0.81.1 ± 0.920.0 ± 1.2BBY+ Vio23.0 ± 0.94.3 ± 2.121.0 ± 0.72.0 ± 1.00.0 ± 0+ Zea21.7 ± 1.663.1 ± 0.87.0 ± 0.72.0 ± 0.812.7 ± 1.8LHCIIbOligomer+ Vio21.0 ± 1.42.0 ± 1.120.57 ± 1.20.0 ± 00.43 ± 0.3+ Zea26.0 ± 1.888.5 ± 3.03.0 ± 0.90.0 ± 023.0 ± 1.4Trimer+ Vio21.0 ± 1.35.0 ± 2.019.0 ± 1.02.0 ± 1.10.0 ± 0+ Zea22.0 ± 1.888.0 ± 5.02.5 ± 1.20.0 ± 019.5 ± 1.6CP26+ Vio32.0 ± 1.71.8 ± 0.730.7 ± 0.71.3 ± 0.50.0 ± 0+ Zea30.0 ± 1.270.0 ± 3.49.0 ± 0.90.0 ± 021.0 ± 1.5CP29+ Vio41.0 ± 1.71.4 ± 0.539.8 ± 1.41.2 ± 0.40.0 ± 0+ Zea39.0 ± 2.151.0 ± 2.319.0 ± 1.00.0 ± 020.0 ± 1.1Fp+ Vio46.0 ± 1.63.0 ± 1.043.2 ± 1.02.8 ± 0.70.0 ± 0+ Zea41.0 ± 0.990.0 ± 3.54.0 ± 1.00.0 ± 037.0 ± 1.1XC, xanthophyll cycle; Vio, violaxanthin; Ant, antheraxanthin; Zea, zeaxanthin; BBY, PSII preparation.a DES, deepoxidation state, calculated as (Zea + 0.5 Ant)/(Zea + Ant + Vio).

Measurements of the low-temperature absorption spectra reveal clear differences in the Soret band region between violaxanthin- and zeaxanthin-enriched samples (Fig. 1). The difference absorption spectrum (“deepoxidized-minus-dark-adapted”) for PSII membranes revealed a typical zeaxanthin-minus-violaxanthin spectrum, similar to that found previously for thylakoid membranes (11Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), with zeaxanthin and violaxanthin 0–0 transitions at 508 and 488 nm, respectively (Fig. 1 A). To test how detergent treatment of the membrane can affect the spectral properties of these pigments, PSII preparations were treated with 1.5% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside for 15 min on ice. The difference spectrum was blue-shifted, with the violaxanthin and zeaxanthin bands appearing at 484 and 504 nm, respectively (Fig. 1 A,dotted line). It is likely that detergent has deeply perturbed the binding sites of these xanthophylls. Violaxanthin and zeaxanthin absorption bands in the free pigment fraction are located near 484 and 505 nm, respectively (Fig.1 B). It is thus probable that, after detergent treatment, these molecules are either loosely bound to the complexes or removed from their binding sites. The deepoxidation-induced absorption difference spectrum of the oligomeric LHCII preparation was very similar to that of PSII membranes (Fig. 1 C), with bands at 488 and 508 nm. We analyzed this preparation by negative-staining electron microscopy to evaluate the state of the protein. Fig. 2 represents a typical view of freshly prepared LHCII oligomers, which appear as particles rather than as membrane vesicles, have a predominantly round, disc-like shape, and are ∼25 nm in diameter (indicated byhorizontal arrows). Each particle accommodates ∼six-eight LHCII trimers. However, these oligomers were unstable, and even a brief desalting step and staining procedure were harsh enough to break their integrity. Therefore, a significant number of smaller particles are also seen on the micrograph. Average frequency of large particles was around 20%, suggesting that approximately every second oligomer was damaged, yielding a number of trimers (six-eight). Despite the glow discharging of the carbon-coated grids some of the oligomeric particles can be clearly seen positioned perpendicularly to the plane of the view (indicated by vertical arrows). This enables us to estimate their thickness to be about 6 nm, indicating single layers of LHCII. Because the isolation procedure also yielded monomeric PSII core complexes and some fraction of the minor antenna components, it is feasible that the detergent has selectively solubilized central parts of the PSII supercomplex (14Boekema E.J. van Roon H. Dekker J.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) leaving intact tetrads of associated trimers and oligomeric peripheral antenna (15Boekema E.J. van Breemen J.F.L. van Roon H.

Presented in Fig. 1, D–F are absorption spectra of LHCII trimers, CP26 and CP29, isolated from violaxanthin- and zeaxanthin-enriched preparations. These have progressively decreasing deepoxidation states (Table I), which we have suggested indicates the presence of a fraction of inaccessible violaxanthin in the minor antenna (10Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As expected, the amplitudes of the difference spectra (deepoxidized-minus-epoxidized) tend to correlate with the measured deepoxidation states. It was found that the absorption maxima for violaxanthin and zeaxanthin are all blue-shifted relative to those for oligomeric LHCII. Indeed for CP29 and CP26 in particular, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin exhibited similar maxima as for the free pigment fraction (compare Fig. 1, B with E andF). Resonance Raman spectra of all the preparations characterized by absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1) were measured using two excitation lines, one to excite violaxanthin preferentially (488.0 nm) and the other for zeaxanthin (514.5 nm; seedotted arrows in Fig. 1). Because deepoxidation removes the major population of violaxanthin molecules, calculation of the difference spectrum dark-adapted-minus-deepoxidized for 488.0 nm excitation yields the RR spectrum of the violaxanthin present in the dark-adapted sample that was converted into zeaxanthin in the deepoxidized one. Similarly for zeaxanthin, a deepoxidized-minus-dark-adapted spectrum can be calculated for 514.5 nm excitation. We recently established this procedure, using the chlorophyll bands at 1437, 1353, and 1327 cm−1 for normalization, and have already applied it successfully to the study of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids in thylakoid membranes (11Ruban A.V.

The RR spectrum of carotenoids contains four different regions, termed ν1–ν4. The ν1 and ν3 regions were found to vary in their peak positions for violaxanthin and zeaxanthin (11Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. FEBS Letters. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The ν1 band, which arises from the stretching mode of the C=C conjugated bonds of the carotenoid molecules, is located around 1529 and 1522 cm−1, whereas the main ν3 mode peaks at 1006 and 1002 cm−1 for violaxanthin and zeaxanthin, respectively. For all of the difference spectra calculated for violaxanthin (at 488.0 nm), the position of the ν1 band was around 1530 cm−1, whereas the ν3 maximum was at 1005–1006 cm−1; for the calculated zeaxanthin spectra (at 514.5 nm), these values were around 1522 and 1002 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, it was possible to extract specific resonance Raman spectra of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin for all of the samples studied. In the ν4 region of RR spectra of carotenoid contribute weak bands arising from the C–H out-of-plane wagging modes. These modes are not active in resonance Raman when the carotenoid molecule is planar. However, distortions of the backbone structure, induced by rotations around C–C bonds, result in an increase in coupling of certain C–H and C–CH3 wagging modes (which appear in this region) with the electronic transition, and the intensity of the bands arising from these modes increases (18Robert B. Frank H. Young A. Britton G. Cogdell R. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 189-201Google Scholar). This region thus yields information about the configuration of the carotenoid studied. Our recent work has demonstrated that bands in the ν4 region in RR spectra of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in thylakoid membranes exhibit a higher intensity and more structure compared with the same pigments in solvent solution (11Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fig. 4represents the ν4 region of the calculated RR difference spectra for violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in the various samples. For PSII membranes, violaxanthin reveals a new band at 950 cm−1 and an enhanced 964 cm−1 transition compared with that of violaxanthin in detergent/lipid micelles (Fig.4 A, traces 1 and 7). The corresponding spectrum for zeaxanthin exhibits an even more complex structure, with enhanced bands at 950, 955, 963, 965, and 970 cm−1 (Fig.4 B, trace 1). Both spectra look very similar to those for the intact thylakoid membrane (11Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Disintegration of PSII particles with detergent results in the disappearance of all structural ν4 components (Fig. 4, traces 2). The structural features of the ν4 region for the oligomeric LHCII preparation are very similar to those of PSII membranes, particularly in the case of zeaxanthin (Fig. 4, traces 3). In the case of isolated LHCII trimers however, the ν4 region has clearly lost much of its structure for both calculated spectra (Fig. 4, traces 4), even though the xanthophyll cycle content was identical to that of the oligomeric LHCIIb preparation. (Note that the zeaxanthin spectrum does, nevertheless, retain a few weak components in this region; Fig.4 B, trace 4.) The structure of the ν4 region for the minor antenna proteins, CP26 and CP29, is even less pronounced than that of the LHCII trimer (Fig. 4 , traces 5 and 6). In all antenna preparations zeaxanthin seems to retain the native configuration better than violaxanthin. The location and binding of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids are central questions in the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of their action in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus against light stress and its consequences (2Horton P. Ruban A.V Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 19Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although there is no doubt about their association with the light-harvesting antenna in PSII, it had not been clear until recently whether they were relatively free to diffuse in the membrane or were tightly bound to pigment-protein complexes (8Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 10Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The analysis of absorption and RR spectra presented here for various PSII preparations have yielded consistent results concerning the binding of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids. The blue shift of their 0–0 electronic transitions in trimeric LHCII, CP26, and CP29 when compared with PSII membranes and oligomeric LHCII correlates precisely with the decrease in amplitude and complexity of the ν4region of their calculated RR spectra. This indicates that xanthophyll cycle carotenoids are not free in the thylakoid membrane, but rather that they are tightly bound to LHA proteins. However, it is clear that it is relatively easy to dislodge these pigments from their binding site. Thus, local (deepoxidase-aided) displacements cannot be excluded. It should be pointed out that only the blue-shifted violaxanthin was accessible to deepoxidase in the minor antenna complexes CP26 and CP29, leaving the tightly bound pool out of reach for the Raman difference analysis. All attempts to resolve the maximum absorption wavelength of this violaxanthin have failed. This could be due to a strong spectral overlap/masking with the 490–495 nm lutein band, which would be consistent with the possible red shift of the violaxanthin maximum due to a more intrinsic location in the complex. The carotenoid ν4 region studied in this work and in our previous papers has revealed a complex structure for xanthophylls bound to their protein hosts (11Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. FEBS Letters. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows a summary of spectra in the 920–990 cm−1 region for the four major antenna xanthophylls of higher plants. One of the luteins in trimeric LHCII is red-shifted and has a strong and complex structure, with bands at 950, 955, 965, and 970 cm−1 (17Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. FEBS Letters. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). Transient absorption measurements have demonstrated association of a carotenoid absorbing around 510 nm with the blue-shifted chlorophylla, which is likely to be Chl a4 (23Peterman E.J.G. Monshouwer R. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1997; 264: 279-284Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). According to the structural model of LHCII, only one of two luteins, L2, is associated with Chl a4 (24Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 130-135Crossref Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 510 nm lutein can be tentatively assigned to site L2. The ν4region for zeaxanthin in the intact membrane reveals a reasonably similar structure to that of L2, with slightly more complexity in the form of additional shoulders around 947 and 961 cm−1 (Fig.5 C). On the other hand, the spectrum for violaxanthin in thylakoids resembles that shown by neoxanthin in the oligomeric form of LHCII (Fig. 5, D and C, respectively). Both spectra have a somewhat reduced structure, exhibiting a main band around 950 cm−1 (with minor contributions at 965 and at 955 cm−1 for neoxanthin only). The origin of these different frequencies may be understood by comparison with the normal coordinate analysis made for β-carotene (21Saito S. Tasumi M. J. Raman Spectroscopy. 1983; 14: 310-321Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this analysis it was concluded that the mode around 950 cm−1 originates from out-of-plane C–H wagging vibrations at the C15=C15′ atoms (see Fig.6 for nomenclature). In our case the assignment seems to be consistent with the fact that the 950 cm−1 frequency is present in the RR spectra of all four xanthophylls, most likely due to the similarity of the configuration and environment of the C15=C15′ group to that of β-carotene. The 955 and 965 cm−1 frequencies have been assigned to C7=C8 and/or C11=C12 (21Saito S. Tasumi M. J. Raman Spectroscopy. 1983; 14: 310-321Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Hence, the variability of their amplitude for the four xanthophylls studied here can be reasonably explained. Indeed, the reduced intensity of these components in the neoxanthin and especially in the violaxanthin spectrum could simply be due to the fact that the C7=C8 region is strongly influenced by the presence of cis configuration allene and epoxy groups interfering with this mode (Fig. 6). To test this possibility we have recorded infrared spectra of all four xanthophylls in the solid state. Fig. 7shows that the major vibrational components of the ν4group do exist, though in different proportions, for all xanthophylls and especially for neoxanthin and violaxanthin. Thus, despite the differences in the composition and configuration of the end groups and their environment, the number of C–H vibrational modes of the xanthophylls remains constant. It is possible that epoxide, restricting the end group mobility, makes the C7=C8environment more rigid, which in turn restricts the distortion induced by interactions with the protein, and therefore the characteristic C–H wagging electronically coupled modes are reduced. Alternatively, different binding loci on protein could distort only certain parts of each xanthophyll, thereby enhancing only some of the C–H modes.Figure 6Structural formulae of the major four PSII antenna xanthophylls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Infrared absorption spectra of lutein (1), zeaxanthin (2Horton P.

For each xanthophyll the characteristic of the backbone distortion would depend on the initial configuration and the flexibility of the molecule and on the nature of the protein-binding site. Trimerization of LHCII monomers affects strongly the lutein L2 configuration, aggregation of LHCII trimers leads to distortion of the neoxanthin molecule, and the macrostructure of LHA in vivo modifies the configuration of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin. Clearly, because each carotenoid is binding at different sites, different protein domains are affected at different levels of the macromolecular organization of the photosynthetic antenna. This provides a first insight into the way in which the structure of the protein subunits is perturbed as a result of their assembly into the LHCII-PSII macrostructure. In turn, this approach provides a new way to understand in vivo the dynamic changes associated with the assembly and functioning of the LHA that occur under different physiological and developmental conditions, including nonphotochemical quenching, photoacclimation, state transitions, and photoinhibition.

https://openalex.org/W2016179944,"Secreted Wnt proteins have numerous signaling functions during development, mediated by Frizzled molecules that act as Wnt receptors on the cell surface. In the genome ofDrosophila, seven Wnt genes (includingwingless; wg), and five frizzledgenes have been identified. Relatively little is known about signaling and binding specificities of different Wnt and Frizzled proteins. We have developed an assay to determine the strength of binding between membrane-tethered Wnts and ligand binding domains of the Frizzled receptors. We found a wide spectrum of binding affinities, reflecting known genetic interactions. Most Wnt proteins can bind to multiple Frizzleds and vice versa, suggesting redundancy in vivo. In an extension of these experiments, we tested whether two different subdomains of the Wg protein would by themselves bind to Frizzled and generate a biological response. Whereas these two separate domains are secreted from cells, suggesting that they form independently folded parts of the protein, they were only able to evoke a response when co-transfected, indicating that both are required for function. In addition to the Frizzleds, members of the LRP family (represented by the arrow gene in Drosophila) are also necessary for Wnt signal transduction and have been postulated to act as co-receptors. We have therefore examined whether a soluble form of the Arrow molecule can bind to Wingless and Frizzled, but no interactions were detected."

In an effort to investigate this possibility and further characterize the catalytic pathway in KatG, we have undertaken rapid freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance (RFQ-EPR) spectroscopy experiments. In this approach, the resting (ferric) enzyme is mixed with peroxide and allowed to react for various periods of time, followed by rapid freezing of the mixture to quench the reaction; EPR spectroscopy is then used to examine the products. In double mixing experiments, isoniazid or analogues can be added to KatG pre-incubated with peroxyacetic acid. The results presented below demonstrate the formation of tyrosyl radical in high yield from the resting enzyme treated with alkyl peroxide, allowing reassignment of an EPR spectrum previously thought to arise from Cmpd I. We have also attempted to identify the key tyrosine residue(s) involved using site-directed mutagenesis. The observations presented here distinguish the behavior of this enzyme from other Class I peroxidases.

M. tuberculosisKatG was prepared from E. coli strain UM262 (katGminus) carrying an overexpression plasmid (pKAT II) containing theM. tuberculosis katG gene according to previously published procedures carried out here in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (14Chouchane S.

Deuterium-labeled KatG was prepared using the same overexpression plasmid in E. coli strain BL21, grown in M9 (minimal) medium containing l-3,3-[2H2]tyrosine orl-2,4,5,6,7-2H5]tryptophan (47.6 mg/L) and supplemented with MgSO4·7 H2O (0.5 g/L), CaCl2·2 H2O (11 mg/L), ZnCl2 (0.5 mg/L), MnSO4·H2O (0.1 mg/L), FeCl2·4 H2O (10 mg/L), glucose (3.60 g/L), and δ-aminolevulinic acid-HCl (16.8 mg/L). Although theE. coli BL21 strain expresses catalase-peroxidase, noE. coli enzyme could be detected by SDS-PAGE of crude extracts from cells grown for 6 h. BL21 strain grew rapidly in minimal medium, which could not be achieved using UM262, which prevented the labeling experiment in this strain. Mutagenesis was performed as described elsewhere (20Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Rapid freeze-quench EPR samples were prepared as previously described (21Zhang W. Wong K.K. Magliozzo R.S. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4123-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using an Update Instrument, Inc. Model 1000 chemical-freeze-quench apparatus. KatG (typically 100 μm heme) and peroxyacetic acid (3- or 10-fold excess over heme) were mixed and aged for the indicated time periods (all in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) followed by freeze-quenching of reaction mixtures in isopentane at −130 °C. Frozen sample powders were packed into precision-bore quartz EPR tubes immersed in an isopentane bath and were examined using a Varian EPR spectrometer operating at X-band. A finger Dewar inserted into the EPR cavity was used for recording spectra at liquid nitrogen (77 K) temperature, while a liquid helium cryostat and Heli-Tran liquid helium transfer system (Advanced Research Systems, Inc., Allentown, PA) were used for EPR at 5.5 K. EPR data acquisition and manipulation was made using WinEPR software (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Simulation of EPR spectra was performed using software provided by F. Neese (22Neese, F., Dissertation, 1997, University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany.Google Scholar, 23Neese F. Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange Bull. University of Indiana, Bloomington, IN1995: 5Google Scholar). Cu(II)EDTA in 50% ethylene glycol was used as a standard for spin quantification by double integration of EPR signal intensities for radical signals. The signal-to-noise ratio in EPR spectra was improved by signal averaging when necessary. The estimation of spin concentration in freeze-quench samples included application of a packing factor of 0.5 to account for dilution by isopentane. Intensity estimation for the EPR signals of resting enzyme was performed by measurement of the peak height taken at g = 6. This information was used to plot loss of ferric iron signal intensity based on a maximum (100%) signal height for the resting enzyme before reaction with peroxide, again taking into account a packing factor of 0.5. For double mixing RFQ-EPR experiments, KatG (150 μm) was mixed with peroxyacetic acid (450 μm) and aged for 500 ms in the first reactor hose. This mixture was then mixed with either phosphate buffer or isoniazid, benzoic hydrazide, or iproniazid (isonicotinic acid 2-isopropyl hydrazide) solutions in the same buffer, and aged for an additional 4.2 ms, 200 ms, or 5 s in the second reactor before freeze-quenching and packing as above. The final concentrations after double-mixing were: KatG, 50 μm; PAA, 150 μm; INH or analogue, 7.7 mm. (A high concentration of INH and analogues was used to allow reactions with tyrosyl radical to occur rapidly with respect to the evolution of the doublet signal in the absence of these substrates.) The frozen samples were then examined by EPR as described above. Optical stopped-flow spectrophotometry was performed using a HiTech Scientific Model SF-61DX2 apparatus equipped with a rapid-scanning diode-array spectrophotometer and Kinet-Asyst software for data acquisition and analysis. The concentrations of KatG (50 μm final) and PAA (150 μm) were the same as those used for the single mixing RFQ-EPR experiments. Formation of Cmpd I was confirmed and the t 12 was evaluated from the increase in absorbance at 590 nm, rather than the loss of absorbance in the Soret region, as previously described (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Rapid freeze-quench EPR spectroscopy experiments combined with characterization of the observed EPR spectra and isotopic substitution experiments demonstrated the formation of tyrosyl radicals in M. tuberculosis KatG in reactions with peroxyacetic acid (orm-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). The kinetics and stoichiometry of radical formation, and an analysis of the proton hyperfine couplings based on simulation of the EPR signals, and quenching of the radical by INH, is also presented. Fig.1 shows the progress of the reaction of ferric (resting) M. tuberculosis KatG with peroxyacetic acid from 50 ms to 10 s after mixing in a typical RFQ-EPR experiment (g = 2 region). A doublet signal was detected within 6.4 ms of mixing (data not shown), which is the earliest time point experimentally accessible. The initial doublet signal, observable through ∼500 ms (Fig. 1, a–d) is characterized by a principal hyperfine splitting of ∼ 19 gauss and a linewidth of ∼30 gauss (peak to trough). The singlet signal centered at g = 2.004, seen in the same reaction mixture after a longer time of incubation (Fig. 1 g) has a line width of 27 gauss and weak hyperfine features. The same signals were obtained whenm-chloroperoxybenzoic acid was used in place of peroxyacetic acid (data not shown). Examination of these samples at 5.5 K allowed observation of the decrease in ferric iron signal intensity in the g = 6 region during this time course (see below). Simulation of the doublet and singlet spectra (Fig.2) was achieved using the parameters given in Table I. The g-tensor values and proton hyperfine couplings were taken to be similar to those reported elsewhere for tyrosyl radicals (24Shi W. Hoganson C.W. Espe M. Bender C.J. Babcock G.T. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Tsai A., Wu, G. Palmer G. Bambai B. Koehn J.A. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the β-methylene hydrogen nuclear hyperfine coupling parameters were varied to achieve the simulation. Although the doublet EPR signal may contain some small fraction of signal intensity due to the singlet, no correction for overlap was made, because the spectrum shown could be adequately simulated using a single set of parameters, as was the singlet recorded after 10 s. Although assignment of both signals to tyrosyl radicals could be made based on simulation parameters, a similar doublet signal may also arise from a neutral tryptophanyl radical (26Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F. Bittl B. Fiege R. Potsch P. Sjoberg B.-M. Graslund A. Lubitz F. Lassmann G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8111-8120Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is due to the fact that the principal hyperfine splitting in the doublet signals arises from the coupling of unpaired electron spin in the π systems of phenol or indole rings with one of the β-methylene hydrogens of both tyrosyl and tryptophanyl radicals (24Shi W. Hoganson C.W. Espe M. Bender C.J. Babcock G.T. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F.

Deuterium-labeled KatG was prepared by enzyme overexpression in bacteria grown in minimal medium containing tryptophan labeled in the indole ring (2,4,5,6,7-[2H5]tryptophan) or tyrosine labeled at the β-methylene group (3,3-[2H2]tyrosine). Uptake of these amino acids and their incorporation into polypeptides in the bacteria expressing KatG affords specific labeling of the enzyme with the desired isotope. This approach was based on methodology used to identify tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase (27Sjoberg B.M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sjoberg B.M. Reichard P. Graslund A. Ehrenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6863-6865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in prostaglandin H synthase (29Tsai A. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid-freeze-quench EPR samples were then prepared as above, using the purified, labeled enzymes. Fig.3 shows a comparison of the doublet and singlet signals formed in unlabeled KatG with spectra recorded using the [2H]tryptophan- and [2H]tyrosine-labeled enzymes. No change in the initial doublet signal occurred for KatG containing deuterium-labeled tryptophan (Fig. 3 d; compare with the unlabeled tryptophan shown in Fig. 3 c). For KatG containing deuterium-labeled tyrosine, an initial singlet (17 gauss line width) (Fig. 3 e) was found in place of the doublet. The line width of the singlet seen at 10 s in [2H]tyrosine-labeled KatG (Fig.3 b) was reduced (15 gauss versus 27 gauss) compared with the signal in unlabeled enzyme at this time point (Fig.3 a). These changes reflect a reduction in nuclear hyperfine coupling accompanying incorporation only of deuterium-labeled tyrosine into the enzyme and thereby confirm the identity of both signals as tyrosyl radicals. The change from doublet to singlet and the more subtle change in the spectrum of the singlet signal are both consistent with a reduction of the strong hyperfine coupling to one of the β-methylene hydrogens in the radicals. These changes could be reproduced in simulations (not shown) of the EPR spectra by scaling the hydrogen nuclear hyperfine coupling parameters given above by the factor (gn(2H)/gn(1H) = 0.1535) to account for the weaker coupling in deuterium-labeled enzyme. Quantitative RFQ-EPR was performed to evaluate the total yield of radical with respect to heme concentration, using both a 3-fold and a 10-fold excess of peroxide over heme. The plot shown in Fig. 4 A presents the concentration of the radical expressed as spin/heme, as a function of time. The slower generation of the singlet follows the initial phase due to formation of the doublet species. The maximum yield of radical was about 0.5 spins per mole of heme at 10 s; beyond 10 s the signal intensity began to decay. The progress of this reaction was the same whether 3-fold or 10-fold excess peroxide was used (data not shown). The initial rate of radical formation, determined by a linear least squares fit of the EPR data for the early time points (0–0.5 s), was 0.18 and 0.19 spin·heme−1·s−1 for KatG/peroxide ratios equal to 1:3 and 1:10, respectively. The curve generated from a similar experiment in which hydrogen peroxide-free PAA was used was the same except for a greater yield of radical after 10 s. The unchanged rate of appearance of radical with increasing peroxide concentration provides evidence for radical formation from an intermediate assumed to be Cmpd I (see below). Examination of RFQ-EPR samples at 5.5 K in the g = 6 region showed a decrease in intensity due to loss of ferric heme iron occurring from the earliest time point accessible (∼ 6.4 ms) through 1 s, after which the intensity began to increase (Fig. 4 B). No signal other than that due to tyrosyl radical or resting enzyme was detected at 5.5 K. These EPR results indicate that the loss of ferric iron under these conditions is faster (t 12 < 50 ms) than the rate of appearance of tyrosyl radical but similar to the rate of formation of Cmpd I estimated from optical stopped-flow measurements under the same conditions (t 12 = 50 ms) (see below). Because an EPR signal characteristic of Cmpd I was not detectable at any time point, no direct kinetic correlation could be drawn between the formation of the radical and the disappearance of a precursor (except FeIII) in this approach. Optical stopped-flow measurements for reactions of KatG with PAA under the same conditions as the RFQ-EPR experiments were also made. Here, the progress from ferric iron to KatG Cmpd I was complete in ∼100 ms using a 3-fold excess of peroxide (Fig.5). The rate of this reaction increases linearly with peroxide concentration (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After the formation of Cmpd I, a steady-state absorbance was achieved. The absorbance then slowly returned to its initial value. During this return, no evidence for other intermediates, such as Cmpd II was detected. These observations are consistent with the presence of Cmpd I during generation of tyrosyl radical. Because tyrosyl radical appears during the interval in which Cmpd I formation is reaching a maximum under the conditions chosen here, the kinetic competence of both redox active centers should be taken into account. The reaction of KatG Cmpd I with substrates has been previously demonstrated (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether the tyrosyl radical is kinetically competent in reactions with a substrate such as the antibiotic INH and analogues, we have undertaken double-mixing RFQ-EPR experiments. The samples were prepared to allow direct comparison of EPR signal intensities, since both the total reaction time and the final enzyme concentration were normalized using buffer or INH solution in the second mixing step, as follows. KatG was reacted with PAA for 500 ms in the first reactor; this mixture was then mixed with buffer or substrates and incubated for a further 4.2 ms or 200 ms before freeze-quenching. The substrate INH, benzoic hydrazide, or iproniazid was added in the second mixing steps. With INH addition, tyrosyl-radical signal intensity was reduced by 30% after a 4.2-ms reaction (Fig. 6 c), compared with the sample mixed with buffer alone (Fig. 6 a). After 200 ms in the presence of INH, the EPR signal of the tyrosyl radical was nearly completely quenched (Fig. 6 d), whereas in its absence (Fig. 6 b), the intensity doubled from that shown in Fig.6 a. Similar results were found using benzoic hydrazide, a drug analogue lacking the pyridine nitrogen (data not shown). With iproniazid, which contains an isopropyl substituent on N(2) of the hydrazide moiety, the extent of quenching was much lower (data not shown). These three hydrazides were chosen because other experiments have shown that INH and benzoic hydrazide bind with high affinity to KatG, whereas no evidence for binding of iproniazid could be demonstrated in a similar concentration range. The fact that INH was shown previously to react with Cmpd I of KatG (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) would allow that Cmpd I was also reduced by substrates in the double mixing experiments. Removal of Cmpd I may limit the yield of radical if rates of formation of radical and rate of reaction of Cmpd I with substrates were competitive, but Cmpd I reduction would not cause quenching of the tyrosyl radical already formed at any particular time point during the reactions. Therefore, the results show that the addition of substrates caused a rapid loss of tyrosyl radical rather than simply preventing the increase in radical concentration that occurs during the additional incubation period after the second mixing steps (4.2 ms or 200 ms). Mutagenesis of M. tuberculosis KatG, in which several of its 20 tyrosines were separately changed to phenylalanine residues (Tyr-98, Tyr-113, Tyr-155, Tyr-229, Tyr-304, and Tyr-426; many of these tyrosine residues are conserved in KatG enzymes from various sources), failed to produce a mutant in which tyrosyl radical doublet and singlet signals were absent from RFQ-EPR samples. However, in some of these mutants, the kinetics and the mechanism of tyrosyl-radical evolution appear to be different compared with the wild-type enzyme. Further study is ongoing to determine whether these observations indicate that secondary tyrosine residues are oxidized in the mutants, as might be expected given that such results occur in other radical-forming enzymes (30Ivancich A.

The results described above confirm the formation of tyrosyl radical(s) in high yield in M. tuberculosis KatG during reaction of the resting enzyme with alkyl peroxides, differentiating this Class I peroxidase from others. The kinetics of radical formation suggest production of a unique radical center via an intermediate most likely to be Compound I. The observation of the evolution of a doublet EPR signal to a singlet signal provides evidence for structural similarity between the radical in KatG and that in PGHS-1 (24Shi W. Hoganson C.W. Espe M. Bender C.J. Babcock G.T. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The catalytic competence of the radical giving rise to the initial doublet EPR signal was demonstrated in reactions with INH and other hydrazides. Tyrosyl radicals are found in other heme enzymes including mammalian catalase (32Ivancich A. Jouve H.M. Sartor B. Gaillard J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9356-9364Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), turnip peroxidase isoenzyme 7 (30Ivancich A. Mazza G. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6860-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and prostaglandin H synthase (25Tsai A., Wu, G. Palmer G. Bambai B. Koehn J.A. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although a catalytic function has only been defined for PGHS, in which a tyrosyl radical is responsible for cyclooxygenase activity. In this enzyme, a single tyrosyl radical gives rise to both a doublet and singlet EPR signal (24Shi W. Hoganson C.W. Espe M. Bender C.J. Babcock G.T. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This behavior has been characterized to be the result of a change in orientation of the phenolic ring with respect to the β-methylene hydrogens of tyrosine. This orientation governs the strength of the interaction of the unpaired electron localized in the π-system of the ring with these hydrogens (24Shi W. Hoganson C.W. Espe M. Bender C.J. Babcock G.T. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Bender C.J. Sahlin M. Babcock G.T. Barry B.A. Chandrashekar T.K. Salowe S.P. Stubbe J. Lindstroem B. Petersson L. Ehrenberg A. Sjoberg B.-M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8076-8083Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This interesting behavior may arise from a change in polarity, because the phenolic radical has more anionic character than the protonated phenol ring of tyrosine and may also be driven by thermodynamic factors that are orientation-dependent (24Shi W. Hoganson C.W. Espe M. Bender C.J. Babcock G.T. Palmer G. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To date, only singlet EPR signals have been reported for the other enzymes (30Ivancich A. Mazza G. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6860-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Ivancich A. Jouve H.M. Sartor B. Gaillard J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9356-9364Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although the analogies between the behavior observed in the rapid freeze-quench EPR experiments on KatG and the well characterized behavior in PGHS are strong, the possibility remains that the doublet and singlet species seen here represent two different tyrosine residues. This issue is being addressed through site-directed mutagenesis and spin labeling. Sequence alignment of M. tuberculosis KatG (39Heym B. Zhang Y. Poulet S. Young D. Cole S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4255-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with PGHS (40Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) did not indicate a homologous candidate among the 20 tyrosines of KatG for the site of the radical, which occurs on residue Tyr-385 in PGHS-1 (29Tsai A. Hsi L.C. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5085-5091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yield of tyrosyl radical in KatG as a function of time was constant on tripling the ratio of peroxide to heme iron. The constancy in this rate argues against the possibility that heme redox recycling, known to occur in KatG in the presence of excess peroxide (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), produces additional radicals beyond a single turnover. Furthermore, formation of a unique tyrosyl radical is suggested, because no increase in yield occurred under conditions enabling a greater rate of recycling (10-fold excess peroxide) that could have generated more radical after the initial turnover from ferric enzyme to Cmpd I and then tyrosyl radical. Thus, radical generation and heme recycling are uncoupled. In earlier work on M. tuberculosis KatG (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a singlet EPR signal found when resting enzyme was reacted withm-chloroperoxybenzoic acid had been assigned to the porphyrin π-cation radical of Cmpd I. 2The spectrometer conditions under which this signal was investigated previously were chosen to facilitate identification of the π-cation radical signal (5.5 K, high microwave power) and at the same time, made observation of the weak hyperfine features in the tyrosyl radical singlet spectrum unfavorable due to saturation. A π-cation radical signal was expected and easily explained because the reaction with peroxide was shown in optical experiments to generate Cmpd I, and the EPR sample exhibited a green color characteristic of Cmpd I. A more comprehensive examination of the characteristics of the singlet EPR spectrum reported earlier was undertaken upon observation of the doublet signal revealed by the rapid freeze-quench EPR approach described here. A singlet EPR signal generated in E. coli hydroperoxidase I, another catalase-peroxidase, was also reported to represent the porphyrin π-cation radical of Cmpd I (42Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5868-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). E. coli hydroperoxidase I has significant homology to M. tuberculosis KatG, including many conserved tyrosines (43Zamocky M. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that the singlet EPR signal seen in that enzyme treated with peroxide may also arise from a tyrosyl radical. We have not found conditions under which a signal around g = 2.0 different from tyrosyl radical could be detected at 5.5 K in samples known from optical stopped-flow measurements to contain Cmpd I. Strong anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the porphyrin π-cation radical and oxyferryl iron (S = 1) could contribute to this phenomenon. Although activation (or at least oxidation) of INH by KatG has been initiated in vitro through various paths starting from resting KatG (44Magliozzo R.S. Marcinkeviciene J.A. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the tyrosyl radical have been directly shown to be kinetically competent in reactions with this antibiotic. The results with small molecules presented here suggest that oxidations or, more likely, hydrogen atom abstractions may be initiated by the tyrosyl radical in a reaction separate from the heme-dependent peroxidase cycle in KatG. Whether the tyrosyl radical in KatG plays a fundamental role in drug activation or whether it may be responsible for some metabolic reactionin vivo remains to be demonstrated. The intermediates potentially formed upon reaction of KatG with peroxides are presented in Fig. 7, although at present we have spectroscopic information that only accounts for some of them. The reaction pathway to tyrosyl radical in KatG presumably requires formation of Cmpd I, followed by its conversion to Intermediate I through a one-electron transfer step. The complete analysis of the kinetics of radical formation awaits further study, since heme redox changes have not yet been correlated with radical formation. The tyrosine mutants of KatG tested to date showed formation of tyrosine radical doublet and singlet EPR signals in RFQ-EPR experiments. Additional mutagenesis and other approaches, including covalent labeling of the initially formed radical, are being pursued to help sort out identification of the tyrosine residue(s) in question in KatG. We thank Drs. WenHai Zhang and John Kozarich for their support."
https://openalex.org/W2168266227,"Interferon (IFN)-alpha, initially characterized as an antiviral cytokine, affects several cellular functions. It is used in clinical practice for the treatment of several tumors, including hematopoietic malignancies, due to its antiproliferative effects. To better characterize the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this property, we conducted our studies in purified primary CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and interleukin (IL)-2. Upon treatment with IFN-alpha, the cells were blocked in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and exhibited impaired entry into S phase and reduced proliferation. Moreover, we detected short- and long-term inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mitogen-activated ERK-regulating kinase (MEK) function, known to control cellular proliferation. The activity of the upstream regulators, Ras and Raf-1, was not affected. Analysis of downstream events controlled by the MEK/ERK pathway showed reduced activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-2 and -4, high levels of the mitotic inhibitors, p21Waf1 and p27Kipl, and decreased cyclin D and E expression. When IFN-alpha was used in combination with MEK and ERK inhibitors, we observed a dose-dependent additive effect in reducing cellular proliferation. Our data demonstrate that IFN-alpha may be associated with other molecules to inhibit cellular growth by targeting the MEK/ERK pathway. This may eventually lead to new clinical strategies to strengthen its anticancer effect."

Hepatic tissue oxygenation was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Plasma alanine aminotransferase and plasma nitrite/nitrate were measured. Following IR there was significant decrease in oxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase and an increase in deoxyhemoglobin (PA redox state, PL-arginine did not attenuate the impairment in hepatic tissue oxygenation after IR (P>0.05 vs IR). In contrast, inhibition of NO synthesis blocked the effect of IPC and further impaired tissue oxygenation (decreased cytochrome oxidase CuA redox state and increased deoxyhemoglobin, both PL-arginine and increased by NO blockade with L-NAME (Plasma ALT, all P< 0.05 vs IR). Hepatic tissue oxygenation correlated significantly with ALT and plasma nitrite/nitrate.

NO stimulation reduced hepatocellular injury, whereas inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis blocked the effect of IPC and reduced tissue oxygenation and increased hepatocellular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2046374206,"The physiological function of human uncoupling protein-3 is still unknown. Uncoupling protein-3 is increased during fasting and high-fat feeding. In these situations the availability of fatty acids to the mitochondria exceeds the capacity to metabolize fatty acids, suggesting a role for uncoupling protein-3 in handling of non-metabolizable fatty acids. To test the hypothesis that uncoupling protein-3 acts as a mitochondrial exporter of non-metabolizable fatty acids from the mitochondrial matrix, we gave human subjects Etomoxir (which blocks mitochondrial entry of fatty acids) or placebo in a cross-over design during a 36-h stay in a respiration chamber. Etomoxir inhibited 24-h fat oxidation and fat oxidation during exercise by approximately 14-19%. Surprisingly, uncoupling protein-3 content in human vastus lateralis muscle was markedly up-regulated within 36 h of Etomoxir administration. Up-regulation of uncoupling protein-3 was accompanied by lowered fasting blood glucose and increased translocation of glucose transporter-4. These data support the hypothesis that the physiological function of uncoupling protein-3 is to facilitate the outward transport of non-metabolizable fatty acids from the mitochondrial matrix and thus prevents mitochondria from the potential deleterious effects of high fatty acid levels. In addition our data show that up-regulation of uncoupling protein-3 can be beneficial in the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2155265479,"Induction of apoptosis by DNA-damaging agents such as 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) includes the activation of Lyn protein tyrosine kinase. We have previously established that Ara-C-induced activation of Lyn results in its binding to a neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) and is requisite for its stimulation and the induction of apoptosis in U937 cells. However, the spacio-temporal organization of these events is unclear. This study demonstrates that part of the total cellular SMase activity is sequestered in sphingomyelin-enriched plasma membrane microdomains (rafts). Under Ara-C and daunorubicin (DNR) treatment, Lyn is rapidly activated and translocated into rafts. The compartmentalization of Lyn (as well as neutral SMase activation and apoptosis) induced by these drugs was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A and raft disruption. In conclusion, this study establishes that DNA-damaging agents such as Ara-C and DNR rapidly induce Lyn activation and its translocation into membrane rafts. This, in turn leads to neutral SMase activation and raft-associated sphingomyelin hydrolysis with the concomitant generation of the proapoptotic lipid second messenger, ceramide. The apparent topological partitioning between DNA damage and apoptosis signaling (integrated into specialized plasma membrane domains) is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2156363822,"The beta-adrenergic cascade is severely impaired in heart failure (HF), in part because of a reduction in the activity of the two dominant cardiac adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms, AC5 and AC6. Hence, cardiac-directed AC overexpression is a conceivable therapeutic strategy in HF. In this study, we explored the consequences at the cellular and organ level of a cardiac-directed expression of the human AC8 in the transgenic mouse line AC8TG. Unlike AC5 and AC6, which are inhibited by intracellular Ca2+, AC8 is stimulated by Ca2+-calmodulin. Langendorff perfused hearts from AC8TG mice had a twofold higher left ventricular systolic pressure, a 40% faster heart rate, a 37% faster relaxation, and a 30% higher sensitivity to external Ca2+ than nontransgenic control mice (NTG). Cell shortening measured in isolated ventricular myocytes developed 22% faster and relaxed 43% faster in AC8TG than in NTG mice. Likewise, Ca2+ transients measured in fluo-3 AM-loaded myocytes were 30% higher and relaxed 24% faster in AC8TG compared with NTG mice. In spite of the large increase in Ca2+ transients and contraction, expression of AC8 had no effect on the whole-cell L-type Ca2+ current (ICa, L) amplitude. Moreover, ICa, L was unchanged even when AC8 was activated by raising intracellular Ca2+. Thus, cardiac expression of AC8 leads to an increase in cAMP that activates specifically Ca2+ uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum but not Ca2+ influx at the sarcolemma, suggesting a strong compartmentation of the cAMP signal."

Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 5-FCL activity has not been studied in plants (9Cossins E.A. Chen L.

Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Cossins E.A. Chen L.

Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar). Its likely main source is hydrolysis of 5,10-CH=H4PteGlun catalyzed by a side reaction of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) in the presence of glycine (4Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14227-14233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although some spontaneous chemical hydrolysis of 5,10-CH=H4PteGlun in mildly acidic subcellular compartments is also possible (13Baggott J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14647-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unlike other folate species, 5-CHO-H4PteGlun does not serve as a one-carbon (C1) donor, but is a potent inhibitor of SHMT and several other enzymes of C1 metabolism (1Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is therefore considered that 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is a potential regulator of C1 metabolism, and that its cellular concentration is set by a futile cycle comprising its synthesis by SHMT and its reconversion to 5,10-CH=H4PteGlun by 5-FCL. Specific roles assigned to this cycle in mammalian cells include regulation of de novo purine synthesis (14Bertrand R. Jolivet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8843-8846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of the flux of C1 units from serine into the folate pool (15Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and of homocysteine remethylation (7Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).5-CHO-H4PteGlun normally represents only 3–10% of the total cellular folate pool in mammals and yeast (4Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas values of 14–40% are reported for leaves and other metabolically active plant tissues (16Cossins E.A. Can. J. Bot. 2000; 78: 691-708Google Scholar, 17Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, 5-CHO-H4PteGlun makes up 50% of the mitochondrial folate pool in pea leaves (17Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which is much more than in mammalian mitochondria (18Horne D.W. Patterson D. Cook R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Horne D.W. Holloway R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Balaghi M. Horne D.W. Wagner C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The high 5-CHO-H4PteGlun content of leaves and their mitochondria is of special interest given the massive SHMT-mediated glycine→serine fluxes that occur during photorespiration in leaf mitochondria (11Rébeillé F. Douce R. Kruger N.J. Hill S.A. Ratcliffe R.G. Regulation of Primary Metabolic Pathways in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar), because in these conditions SHMT could both form 5-CHO-H4PteGlun and be inhibited by it. Plant mitochondrial SHMT has not, however, been tested for sensitivity to 5-CHO-H4PteGlun (9Cossins E.A. Chen L. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 437-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is abundant in some dormant organs, comprising 70% of total folates in soybean seeds (21Shin Y.S. Kim E.S. Watson J.E. Stokstad E.L. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and 85% in Neurospora crassa spores (22Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is metabolized rapidly during germination (22Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest a role as a storage form of folate (1Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Given the evidence that 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is a major folate in plants and their mitochondria, we set out to find whether plants have 5-FCL and, if so, where it is in the cell. Here, we describe the cloning and initial characterization of 5-FCL fromArabidopsis and tomato and demonstrate that the enzyme is located in mitochondria. We further show that plant mitochondrial SHMT, like SHMTs in other organisms, is inhibited by physiological concentrations of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun.DISCUSSIONThe work presented here demonstrates that plants have 5-FCL enzymes, that plant 5-FCL polypeptides have mitochondrial targeting sequences, and that the active enzyme is located primarily if not solely in mitochondria. Even though plant 5-FCLs are structurally similar to those of other organisms and have broadly similar kinetic characteristics, mitochondrial localization sets them apart from their cytosolic counterparts in other eukaryotes. In being located in mitochondria in plants but not other eukaryotes, 5-FCL resembles the last five enzymes of de novo folate synthesis (11Rébeillé F. Douce R. Kruger N.J. Hill S.A. Ratcliffe R.G. Regulation of Primary Metabolic Pathways in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar, 46Hanson A.D. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and more generally adds to the growing list of unique features of plant C1 metabolism (10Hanson A.D. Roje S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although our biochemical data do not exclude there being a few percent of the total 5-FCL activity in other compartments, genomic data show that Arabidopsis has only one 5-FCL gene, and EST data suggest that the same is true of tomato. If there is any extramitochondrial 5-FCL activity in plants, it would therefore have to arise by a dual-targeting mechanism (47Small I. Wintz H. Akashi K. Mireau H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 265-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Green leaf mitochondria have much higher SHMT concentrations than mitochondria from other organs (48Besson V. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Douce R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 665-673Google Scholar). Since leaf mitochondria receive a large photorespiratory influx of glycine during illumination (11Rébeillé F. Douce R. Kruger N.J. Hill S.A. Ratcliffe R.G. Regulation of Primary Metabolic Pathways in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar), and glycine promotes 5-CHO-H4PteGlun formationvia SHMT (1Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the combination of high titers of both SHMT and glycine may result in a much greater rate of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun formation in leaf mitochondria than in mitochondria of other organs. In this connection it is noteworthy that our data showed that leaf mitochondria have far higher 5-FCL activity than root mitochondria. Because plant mitochondrial SHMT, like other SHMTs, is inhibited by physiological levels of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5, the strict control of mitochondrial 5-CHO-H4PteGlun concentration may be essential to photorespiration, and 5-FCL could contribute to this control. This hypothesis is illustrated in Fig.7.The mitochondrial localization of plant 5-FCL raises the question of whether its substrate 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is also solely mitochondrial, and if not how 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is metabolized in other cellular compartments. Analysis of folate pools of pea leaves indicates that 5-CHO-H4PteGlun dominates the mitochondrial folate pool but occurs elsewhere in the cell (17Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), most probably mainly in the cytosol which contains the bulk of cellular folates (17Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 44Gambonnet B. Jabrin S. Ravanel S. Karan M. Douce R. Rébeillé F. J. Sci. Food Agric. 2001; 81: 835-841Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SHMT, the enzyme that produces 5-CHO-H4PteGlun (4Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14227-14233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), occurs in the cytosol and chloroplasts as well as in mitochondria, the distribution in green leaves being roughly 25% cytosolic, 25% chloroplastic, and 50% mitochondrial (48Besson V. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Douce R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 665-673Google Scholar). Plant cells may also generate 5-CHO-H4PteGlun by chemical hydrolysis of 5,10-CH=H4PteGlun in the acidic central vacuole (13Baggott J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14647-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).One possibility for the disposal of extramitochondrial 5-CHO-H4PteGlun in plants is that it is imported into mitochondria, and in support of this there is a homolog of the mammalian mitochondrial folate transporter in theArabidopsis genome (46Hanson A.D. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, at least the C1 moiety of exogenously supplied 5-CHO-H4PteGlun can enter the mitochondria inArabidopsis (49Prabhu V. Chatson K.B. Lui H. Abrams G.D. King J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, there may be other ways to dispose of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun, perhaps leading to non-folate products. In this context it is interesting that knocking out 5-FCL in yeast gave only a modest (3-fold) increase in 5-CHO-H4PteGlun and did not affect growth (4Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, ferritin has been found to mediate the oxidative cleavage of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun in vitro andin vivo (50Suh J.R. Oppenheim E.W. Girgis S. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas 5-FCL may be the only enzyme in plants that can recycle 5-CHO-H4PteGlun back to the metabolically active folate pool, it may not be the only one able to destroy it. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase, EC 6.3.3.2(5-FCL),1 also termed 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, catalyzes the irreversible ATP-dependent conversion of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-H4PteGlun) to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH=H4PteGlun). 5-FCL has been purified from bacteria and mammalian liver (1Stover P.

Unlike other folate species, 5-CHO-H4PteGlun does not serve as a one-carbon (C1) donor, but is a potent inhibitor of SHMT and several other enzymes of C1 metabolism (1Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is therefore considered that 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is a potential regulator of C1 metabolism, and that its cellular concentration is set by a futile cycle comprising its synthesis by SHMT and its reconversion to 5,10-CH=H4PteGlun by 5-FCL. Specific roles assigned to this cycle in mammalian cells include regulation of de novo purine synthesis (14Bertrand R. Jolivet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8843-8846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of the flux of C1 units from serine into the folate pool (15Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and of homocysteine remethylation (7Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 5-CHO-H4PteGlun normally represents only 3–10% of the total cellular folate pool in mammals and yeast (4Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas values of 14–40% are reported for leaves and other metabolically active plant tissues (16Cossins E.A. Can. J. Bot. 2000; 78: 691-708Google Scholar, 17Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, 5-CHO-H4PteGlun makes up 50% of the mitochondrial folate pool in pea leaves (17Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which is much more than in mammalian mitochondria (18Horne D.W. Patterson D. Cook R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Horne D.W. Holloway R.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Balaghi M. Horne D.W. Wagner C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The high 5-CHO-H4PteGlun content of leaves and their mitochondria is of special interest given the massive SHMT-mediated glycine→serine fluxes that occur during photorespiration in leaf mitochondria (11Rébeillé F. Douce R. Kruger N.J. Hill S.A. Ratcliffe R.G. Regulation of Primary Metabolic Pathways in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar), because in these conditions SHMT could both form 5-CHO-H4PteGlun and be inhibited by it. Plant mitochondrial SHMT has not, however, been tested for sensitivity to 5-CHO-H4PteGlun (9Cossins E.A. Chen L. Phytochemistry. 1997; 45: 437-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is abundant in some dormant organs, comprising 70% of total folates in soybean seeds (21Shin Y.S. Kim E.S. Watson J.E. Stokstad E.L. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and 85% in Neurospora crassa spores (22Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is metabolized rapidly during germination (22Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest a role as a storage form of folate (1Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Given the evidence that 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is a major folate in plants and their mitochondria, we set out to find whether plants have 5-FCL and, if so, where it is in the cell. Here, we describe the cloning and initial characterization of 5-FCL fromArabidopsis and tomato and demonstrate that the enzyme is located in mitochondria. We further show that plant mitochondrial SHMT, like SHMTs in other organisms, is inhibited by physiological concentrations of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun. DISCUSSIONThe work presented here demonstrates that plants have 5-FCL enzymes, that plant 5-FCL polypeptides have mitochondrial targeting sequences, and that the active enzyme is located primarily if not solely in mitochondria. Even though plant 5-FCLs are structurally similar to those of other organisms and have broadly similar kinetic characteristics, mitochondrial localization sets them apart from their cytosolic counterparts in other eukaryotes. In being located in mitochondria in plants but not other eukaryotes, 5-FCL resembles the last five enzymes of de novo folate synthesis (11Rébeillé F. Douce R. Kruger N.J. Hill S.A. Ratcliffe R.G. Regulation of Primary Metabolic Pathways in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar, 46Hanson A.D. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and more generally adds to the growing list of unique features of plant C1 metabolism (10Hanson A.D. Roje S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although our biochemical data do not exclude there being a few percent of the total 5-FCL activity in other compartments, genomic data show that Arabidopsis has only one 5-FCL gene, and EST data suggest that the same is true of tomato. If there is any extramitochondrial 5-FCL activity in plants, it would therefore have to arise by a dual-targeting mechanism (47Small I. Wintz H. Akashi K. Mireau H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 265-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Green leaf mitochondria have much higher SHMT concentrations than mitochondria from other organs (48Besson V. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Douce R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 665-673Google Scholar). Since leaf mitochondria receive a large photorespiratory influx of glycine during illumination (11Rébeillé F. Douce R. Kruger N.J. Hill S.A. Ratcliffe R.G. Regulation of Primary Metabolic Pathways in Plants. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 53-99Crossref Google Scholar), and glycine promotes 5-CHO-H4PteGlun formationvia SHMT (1Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the combination of high titers of both SHMT and glycine may result in a much greater rate of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun formation in leaf mitochondria than in mitochondria of other organs. In this connection it is noteworthy that our data showed that leaf mitochondria have far higher 5-FCL activity than root mitochondria. Because plant mitochondrial SHMT, like other SHMTs, is inhibited by physiological levels of 5-CHO-H4PteGlu5, the strict control of mitochondrial 5-CHO-H4PteGlun concentration may be essential to photorespiration, and 5-FCL could contribute to this control. This hypothesis is illustrated in Fig.7.The mitochondrial localization of plant 5-FCL raises the question of whether its substrate 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is also solely mitochondrial, and if not how 5-CHO-H4PteGlun is metabolized in other cellular compartments. Analysis of folate pools of pea leaves indicates that 5-CHO-H4PteGlun dominates the mitochondrial folate pool but occurs elsewhere in the cell (17Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), most probably mainly in the cytosol which contains the bulk of cellular folates (17Chen L. Chan S.Y. Cossins E.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 44Gambonnet B. Jabrin S. Ravanel S. Karan M. Douce R. Rébeillé F. J. Sci. Food Agric. 2001; 81: 835-841Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SHMT, the enzyme that produces 5-CHO-H4PteGlun (4Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14227-14233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), occurs in the cytosol and chloroplasts as well as in mitochondria, the distribution in green leaves being roughly 25% cytosolic, 25% chloroplastic, and 50% mitochondrial (48Besson V. Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Douce R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1995; 33: 665-673Google Scholar). Plant cells may also generate 5-CHO-H4PteGlun by chemical hydrolysis of 5,10-CH=H4PteGlun in the acidic central vacuole (13Baggott J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14647-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).One possibility for the disposal of extramitochondrial 5-CHO-H4PteGlun in plants is that it is imported into mitochondria, and in support of this there is a homolog of the mammalian mitochondrial folate transporter in theArabidopsis genome (46Hanson A.D. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, at least the C1 moiety of exogenously supplied 5-CHO-H4PteGlun can enter the mitochondria inArabidopsis (49Prabhu V. Chatson K.B. Lui H. Abrams G.D. King J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, there may be other ways to dispose of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun, perhaps leading to non-folate products. In this context it is interesting that knocking out 5-FCL in yeast gave only a modest (3-fold) increase in 5-CHO-H4PteGlun and did not affect growth (4Holmes W.B. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20205-20213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, ferritin has been found to mediate the oxidative cleavage of 5-CHO-H4PteGlun in vitro andin vivo (50Suh J.R. Oppenheim E.W. Girgis S. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35646-35655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas 5-FCL may be the only enzyme in plants that can recycle 5-CHO-H4PteGlun back to the metabolically active folate pool, it may not be the only one able to destroy it.

https://openalex.org/W2086908238,"We investigated the effect of a nitric oxide (NO)-releasing derivative of aspirin (NCX-4016) on a mitochondria-dependent model of apoptosis in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC). Exposure of HUVEC to staurosporine caused a progressive fall in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and apoptosis. Exposure to an NO donor, (z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA-NO), caused an early (1-3h) hyperpolarization of DeltaPsi(m) and reduction of apoptosis that was followed (at 4-8 h) by an accelerated collapse of DeltaPsi(m) and cell death. In contrast, treatment with NCX-4016, but not with aspirin or a non-NO-releasing analogue of NCX-4016, protected HUVEC against the apoptotic actions of staurosporine for up to 8 h. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that although NCX-4016 released NO in subcellular compartments, DETA-NO caused a generalized increase in cytosolic fluorescence. Exposure to DETA-NO resulted in a rapid and profound inhibition of cell respiration (78.3 +/- 6.4%), whereas NCX-4016 caused a less pronounced reduction in oxygen consumption (43.5 +/- 5.3%). Staurosporine caused a time-dependent activation of proapoptotic caspases. NCX-4016 prevented this activation, whereas DETA-NO failed to inhibit caspase activity. In contrast to DETA-NO, NCX-4016 did not increase mitochondrial oxidative stress. These data demonstrated that NCX-4016 conveys NO directly inside endothelial cells and modulates mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W2099597748,"The mechanism by which dietary fatty acids confer protection against cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death is not resolved. Here, we study the effects of several known cardio-protective and arrhythmogenic fatty acids on the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs), which is responsible for the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. cRNAs encoding either or both of the two subunits, KvLQT1 and hminK, that together produce IKs, were injected into Xenopus oocytes, and the effects of various fatty acids were determined. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) significantly augmented IKs as did the short-chained fully saturated lauric acid, and to a lesser extent the cis-unsaturated oleic acid. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was without significant effect on current magnitude, although it reduced the rate of activation. These results suggest that not all ""antiarrhythmic"" fatty acids target the same channel. To examine the role of hminK in this response, KvLQT1 was expressed alone. In this case, DHA, lauric acid, and oleic acid did not augment current, suggesting that hminK confers fatty acid sensitivity to IKs."
https://openalex.org/W2116584011,"K-ras codon 12 mutation is more oncogenic in in vitro and in vivo experimental systems than K-ras codon 13 mutation. Moreover, human colorectal tumors bearing a codon 12 mutation are more aggressive, invasive, and metastatic than the same tumor types carrying a codon 13 mutation. However, despite the association between specific sarcoma types and codon 12 or codon 13 mutations, the relationship between the position of the mutated codon at ras genes and tumor aggressiveness has not been studied in this tumor type. Here, we used a nude mice model to evaluate the tumorogenic capacity of stable transfectants of NIH3T3 fibroblasts, expressing K-ras mutated at codon 12 (K12) or 13 (K13), and morphologically, functionally, and molecularly compared these tumors. We found histopathological differences between them, K12-derived tumors showing fibrosarcoma-like features, whereas K13-derived tumors resembled malignant fibrous histiocytomas. Moreover, K12 tumors showed shorter latency of appearance, lower apoptotic and mitotic rates, and higher expression of markers for sarcoma aggressiveness (Ki67, p53 and c-myc) than K13 tumors. They also showed differences in the expression or activation of Ras, Ras downstream pathways [c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), MAPK and AKT], and apoptotic [AKT, Bcl-2, Focal adhesion kinase (FAK)] and mitotic (cyclin B1) regulators, which could explain their functional differences. Most remarkably, the significantly diminished apoptotic rate observed in K12-derived tumors was associated with enhanced antiapoptotic signaling through the AKT pathway. These morphological, functional, and molecular differences demonstrate that codon 12 and codon 13 mutations in the K-ras oncogene can induce two different soft tissue sarcoma types in our in vivo model."
https://openalex.org/W2001261348,"Macromolecular crowding, in principle, should affect any reaction that is accompanied by significant reduction in excluded volume. Here we have examined the influence of crowding on reverse proteolysis. We show that proteosynthesis of a polypeptide product with an interacting folding motif such as coiled coil is facilitated in crowded media as a consequence of the volume exclusion effect. Further, we demonstrate that crowding could also effect the conversion of a noncovalent protein complex (fragment complementing protein) obtained by limited proteolysis to the native covalent form, but only if the formation of the native protein results in large compaction leading to a substantial volume exclusion effect. Subtilisin-catalyzed reformation of native triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from multiple fragments is facilitated by crowding. However, a single nick in ribonuclease S (RNase S) could not be ligated under similar conditions. The failure of generation of RNase A from RNase S is consistent with the fact that the crystal structure of the two forms are almost superimposable, and hence no significant difference of volume exclusion exists between reactant (RNase S) and product (RNase A). In contrast, considerable compaction, and consequently large reduction in excluded volume, is attained through the assembly of a TIM barrel structure.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 2Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

By excluding volume to each other, macromolecules decrease the configurational entropy, leading to an increase in chemical potential and free energy of all molecules. Macromolecular crowding perturbs the equilibrium of a reaction by destabilizing reactants or product so as to exclude least volume to other molecules in the milieu (6Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Associative processes leading to the formation of compact structures and macromolecular assemblies are therefore facilitated in crowded media because they are accompanied by a reduction of excluded volume (7Rivas G. Fernandez J.A. Minton A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3150-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Rivas G. Fernandez J.A. Minton A.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9379-9388Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Conversely, the hydrolytic or degradative reactions are likely to be somewhat hindered in the presence of macromolecular crowding relative to the dilute solutions. It follows that molecular crowding or confinement under favorable conditions may promote shifting of the equilibrium of such reactions toward synthesis. Interestingly, this has lead to the speculation that enzymes that catalyze degradative reactions, such as limited proteolysis in vitro (i.e. in dilute solution), might actually catalyze the reverse reaction in vivo and thus function as synthetic rather than degradative enzymes (9Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). The protease-catalyzed ligation reactions involving native polypeptide segments (totally unprotected fragments) in vitro are promoted in the presence of organic cosolvents and generally for those participating fragments whose reacting termini are brought into proximity through noncovalent associations (10Homandberg G.A. Laskowski Jr., M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Chaiken I.M. Crit. Rev.

This principle of shifting the peptide bond equilibrium is based on the notion that whereas the enthalpic barrier (ionization of the carboxyl) to peptide bond synthesis is lowered in the presence of organic cosolvent, the entropic barrier is overcome by the proximity of the reacting ends. Nonetheless, reverse-proteolytic condensation of non-complexing fragments in organic cosolvents, or even in neat aqueous solution, does occur in situations where product assumes conformational rigidity through acquisition of helix or sheet-like structure (13Kumaran S.

The idea that macromolecular crowding favors conformational compaction and association and in principle can affect any reaction in which the product excludes significantly less volume than the reactants (1Minton A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10577-10580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar) has prompted us to explore the effect of volume exclusion on the ability of proteases to catalyze peptide bond synthesis. Accordingly, we have studied the reverse-proteolytic condensation of both non-associated as well as associated peptide systems in the presence of dextran and polyethylene glycol (PEG).1The effect of crowding agents on the V8 protease-mediated assembly of coiled-coil structures from non-interacting (non-associated) unstructured designer peptide reactants and subtilisin-catalyzed splicing of the discontinuity sites in interacting (associated) fragment systems of ribonuclease A (10Homandberg G.A.

Biol. 1999; 6: 625-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) has been examined. The results demonstrate that the volume exclusion effect can indeed act as a driving force of reverse proteolysis. The study projects new possibilities of modular polypeptide assembly by protease-mediated ligation in a quasi-physiological condition of macromolecular crowding. Importantly, it lends credence to the suggestion that in favorable situations proteases might actually catalyze the synthesis of a peptide bondin vivo. Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (endoproteinase Glu-C) and subtilisin were purchased from Pierce and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Dextran (∼67 kDa), rabbit muscle triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), ribonuclease A (RNase A), ribonuclease S (RNase S), and 1-propanol were from Sigma. Polyethylene glycol 3000 (PEG) was obtained from Fluka. The chemicals used in the peptide synthesis were obtained from Novabiochem. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and procured from standard commercial sources. Peptides were synthesized on a semi-automated peptide synthesizer (Model 90, Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY) employing standard solid phase protocols and using Fmoc chemistry. The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin using TFA:H2O (95:5, by volume) for 2–3 h with constant stirring at room temperature. The resin was removed by filtration, and the crude peptide was precipitated in cold anhydrous ether. Peptides were purified by RPHPLC on a semi-preparative Zorbax column employing a linear gradient of 5–90% of solvent B (solvent B: 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% of TFA; solvent A: 0.1% TFA in water) in 130 mins. The flow rate was maintained at 2 ml/min throughout the run. The identity of the peptides was established by electro-spray mass spectrometry (ESMS) (13Kumaran S. Datta D. Roy R.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The ligation reaction was carried out in ammonium bicarbonate (50 mm, pH 8) in the presence of an appropriate amount of crowding agent (dextran or PEG) or organic cosolvent. An equimolar mixture (5 mm) of the respective complementary fragments was incubated with V8 protease (1:100, w/w, enzyme:substrate) at 4 °C. Aliquots of the reactions mixture were analyzed at various time intervals by RPHPLC, and product yield was quantified from the peak areas using a computer program. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco-710 instrument equipped with a temperature cell holder. The equipment was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. The spectra were an average of 10 scans, and data were presented as mean residue ellipticity (MRE) expressed in deg cm2 dmol−1. The peptide concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficient of tyrosine, E280 nm(literature) = 1280 mol−1cm−1 (19Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The proteolysis of TIM was carried out in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. TIM (200 μm) was incubated with subtilisin in a ratio of 100:1 (w/w) in a final volume of 100 μl. The digestion was carried out at 37 °C for the desired time. Aliquots of the digest mixture at various time intervals were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The re-ligation of the fragments was initiated by the addition of appropriate amounts of acetonitrile or crowding agent (dextran/PEG) to the proteolysed TIM mixture. The synthetic reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C. The reformation of TIM was monitored by SDS-PAGE. RNase S (2 mm) was taken in ammonium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0) containing appropriate amounts of glycerol or dextran or PEG and incubated with subtilisin (100:1 w/w) at 25 or 4 °C. Samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals, and the synthesis of RNase A was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The RNase A or S assays were carried out by standard procedures using cytidine cyclic monophosphate (cCMP) as substrate (20Crook E.M. Mathias A.P. Rabin B.R. Biochem. J. 1960; 74: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The effect of crowding agent on the activity of RNase S was assessed by incubating protein in the crowding agent for a defined time (0–24 h) prior to incubation with the substrate. The activity of TIM was determined in a coupled assay in which dihydroxyacetone phosphate produced from glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate (substrate for TIM) is converted to glycerol-1-phosphate by glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (21Snyder R. Lee E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 430-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The stoichiometric conversion of NADH to NAD+ in this process is monitored as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The theoretical prediction of accelerated coiled-coil folding by crowding or confinement (22Zhou H.X. Dill K.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11289-11293Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and the expectation that high binding affinities of the coiled-coil peptides are likely to be magnified in the presence of crowding were the prime motivations for choosing a coiled-coil folding motif for the study. V8 protease-catalyzed syntheses of three 20-residue designer peptides with the consensus sequence DdAQAaKQdAEAaQKdAGGY containing a heptad repeat (abcdefg) and designated LIAA, VLAA, and VVAA based on the residues at adeg heptad positions (Fig.1 A), were used in the present work. The choice was based on prior knowledge about the structural feature of these peptides. LIAA and VLAA form oligomeric helices and VVAA remains unstructured in dilute solutions (23Boon C.L. Chakrabartty A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Importantly, the location of the glutamic acid in the middle of the sequence satisfies the primary specificity of the V8 protease, and minimal changes in the sequence precludes secondary sub-site specificity-related differences among the substrates. The presence of Tyr residue at the C-terminus of each peptide ensures accurate spectroscopic estimation of the peptide concentrations. The aforementioned peptides are ideally suited for testing the hypothesis that construction of coiled-coil or helix bundle types of structures through protease-catalyzed fragment condensation (residues 1–11 and 12–20) should be facilitated in crowded solutions, because intermolecular interactions leading to association of enzymically ligated molecules (self-assembly) into such ordered structures would result in the reduction of excluded volume (Fig. 1 B). On the contrary, protease-mediated synthesis of the structureless control peptide VVAA from its complementary fragment is unlikely to occur, because the formation of such a contiguous product would not lead to any significant reduction in excluded volume. We first examined the effect of dextran on the V8 protease-mediated synthesis of LIAA. For this, a 1:1 mixture of the reactant peptides (1–11 and 12–20) containing varying concentrations of dextran was incubated with V8 protease at pH 8 and 4 °C. The extent of formation of the product was monitored by HPLC (Fig.2). The synthetic yields of LIAA as a function of time, in the absence and presence of the crowding agent, is depicted in Fig. 3. It can be seen that LIAA is formed to the extent of 5% at equilibrium in dilute aqueous solution. The synthetic yield of LIAA increased progressively with an increase in the dextran concentration. A 2-fold increase (10%) in the equilibrium yield in the presence of 80 mg/ml concentration of dextran relative to the dilute solution (5%) sharply increased to about seven-fold (37%) when the concentration of the crowding agent was raised to 150 mg/ml.Figure 3Kinetics of LIAA synthesis in the presence of dextran. The synthesis was carried out in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of dextran (0–150 mg/ml). Aliquots of the samples at various time points were analyzed by RPHPLC as described in Fig. 2. The yield of the product was quantified from the peak areas using a computer program. The curve labels are as follows: (filled triangle), no dextran; (filled square), 80 mg/ml dextran; (filled circle), 100 mg/ml dextran; and (empty triangle), 150 mg/ml dextran.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the aforementioned results of the concentration-dependent effect of dextran on LIAA synthesis, we carried out V8 protease-catalyzed ligation of complementary fragments of VLAA and VVAA in the presence or absence of 150 mg/ml of dextran (Fig. 4). Under identical conditions as those used for LIAA, the synthesis of VLAA did not occur in dilute aqueous solution. However, VLAA was produced in the presence of dextran, albeit with a lower yield as compared with LIAA, about 7% versus 37% for LIAA. The complementary fragments of VVAA, as expected, could not be ligated in either the presence or absence of the crowding agent. The much lower yield of LIAA in dilute aqueous solution and the undetectable synthesis of VLAA may be related to the conformational stability of the respective contiguous products. The increment of the product yield from 5 to 37% and nil to 7%, respectively, for LIAA and VLAA in the presence of dextran could be attributed to the volume exclusion effect. To see that the effect of crowding on reverse-proteolytic condensation of complementary fragments was not a manifestation of some direct interaction of the crowding molecule with peptides, we carried out conformational analyses of the complementary fragments (reactant peptides 1–11 and 12–20) and the product (1–20). Toward this, circular dichroic spectra of discontiguous and contiguous peptides were recorded in the presence and absence of dextran (phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 4 °C). As can be seen in Fig. 5, the spectrum of the reactant peptide pairs (1:1 mixture, discontiguous) in all cases is featureless in both the presence and absence of the crowding agent, suggesting that the reacting peptides are predominantly structureless. The contiguous VVAA (control sequence) also did not show any structure. In contrast, CD spectra of the contiguous LIAA and VLAA peptides showed two minima around 208 and 222 nm that are characteristics of helical structure. The spectra of the peptides remained largely unperturbed in the presence of dextran (albeit small increase in ellipticity was noticed for VLAA), indicating the absence of direct interactions between dextran and the peptides. However, the ratio of [θ]222/[θ]208 for each peptide was found to be higher in the presence of dextran as compared with the dilute solution. The ratio for LIAA was found to be 1.01 and 1.04 in the absence and presence of dextran respectively. A value of [θ]222/[θ]208 > 1 is diagnostic of the presence of a coiled-coil helix in aqueous solution (24Monera O.D. Zhao N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19218-19227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the [θ]222/[θ]208 ratio of VLAA was significantly increased in the presence of dextran, values were much lower compared to LIAA in both the absence (0.91 versus1.01) and presence (.97 versus 1.04) of dextran. Thus, dextran did not shift the equilibrium to synthesis by direct interactions with either product or reactant. Rather, the synthetic reaction was facilitated in the presence of dextran, because crowding promoted association of helices to form coiled coils that lead to the reduction in excluded volume. To get further insight into the stability aspects of LIAA and VLAA in a crowded environment, we studied the temperature-dependent CD of the peptide products in the presence and absence of dextran. For this, CD spectrum of LIAA and VLAA were recorded between 4 and 60 °C. A plot of [θ]222/[θ]208 versus temperature is shown in Fig.6. For both peptides, this ratio is higher in the presence of dextran at any given temperature. Further, the [θ]222/[θ]208 ratio for LIAA, even in the dilute solution, is greater compared to the value of VLAA obtained in the presence of dextran, suggesting that the oligomeric structure of LIAA is endowed with much higher stability compared with VLAA. This interpretation is consistent with the respective synthetic yields of LIAA and VLAA. To ensure that the phenomenon was not specific to the presence of dextran, and to confirm that the observed effect was indeed a consequence of crowding, we studied the synthesis of the aforementioned peptides under identical conditions, but in the presence of 150 mg/ml of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The time course of the ligation reaction is shown in Fig. 7. The synthesis of LIAA proceeded in the presence of PEG as efficiently as in dextran. The reaction attained equilibrium in about 100 h, yielding 40% of LIAA. That compares well with the yield of 35–37% obtained in dextran solution. Nonetheless, the synthesis of VLAA, which was quite low in the presence of dextran, could not be detected in the presence of PEG. This may be related to the differential volume excluding ability of the two crowder molecules vis a vis the oligomeric nature of the two products. The protease-catalyzed synthesis of the aforementioned peptides was also carried out in the presence of a helix-inducing organic cosolvent. Previously we have demonstrated the viability of product-directed conformational traps, wherein equilibrium between “folded” product and the less structured starting reactants acts as a driving force for reversal of proteolysis (13Kumaran S. Datta D. Roy R.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Kumaran S. Datta D. Roy R.P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In these reactions organic cosolvent facilitates the reversal of proteolysis by inducing secondary structure (helix or sheet) to the product as well as by enhancing the protonation of the reacting carboxyl group. In contrast, macromolecular crowding promotes the peptide ligation reactions simply through a volume exclusion effect emanating from conformational compaction of the product due to oligomerization/assembly. Given the mechanistic differences, it was of interest to compare the effects of cosolvent with crowding on reverse proteolysis. For this, we carried out the peptide ligation reactions in the presence of aqueous-propanol solution. As seen in Fig. 8, the synthesis of both LIAA and VLAA proceeded efficiently in the presence of 25% 1-propanol. Interestingly, the equilibrium yield of VLAA (75–80%) was found to be similar or slightly higher (70–75%) compared with LIAA. Furthermore, the yield of the peptides in the presence of organic cosolvent was much higher compared with that of the crowded medium; a 2-fold and 10-fold enhancement in yields for LIAA and VLAA, respectively, was obtained in the presence of organic cosolvent relative to the crowded medium. The high synthetic yield of VLAA in the presence of organic solvent could be attributed to the ability of cosolvent-mediated enhancement of intrinsic helicity of the peptide coupled to the suppression of the ionization of the reacting α-carboxyl group. Indeed, CD spectroscopy revealed a significant increase in the helicity of VLAA ([θ]222 was 13,500 in aqueous solution versus 23,000 in 25% 1-propanol); the spectra of the VLAA and LIAA in the presence of 25% 1-propanol were almost super-imposable (Fig. 8, inset). As usual, the complementary fragments of control VVAA peptide could not be ligated in the presence of 1-propanol. To further illuminate the mechanistic imperatives of reverse proteolysis in crowded medium and distinguish it from conformationally driven peptide ligations that occur in the presence of structure-promoting solvents, we investigated the effect of crowding on the ability of V8 protease to catalyze the ligation of complementary peptide segments (TC295–302 and TC303–316) representing residues 295–316 (TC-peptide) of thermolysin (25Titani K. Hermodson M.A. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2427-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The proteo-synthesis of a 22-residue-long TC-peptide has been demonstrated in the presence of helix-inducing organic solvents, and its success has been attributed to the conformational trap mechanism (13Kumaran S. Datta D. Roy R.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). TC-peptide possesses very little helicity in aqueous solution, but it assumes significant helical conformation in the presence of 1-propanol. TC-peptide in aqueous-propanol solution produced a maximum yield of 23%versus 70–80% seen with VLAA and LIAA. This is related to the fact that TC-peptide possesses less helicity (about 30%) compared with the VLAA and LIAA (65–70% helicity) in the presence of organic cosolvent. Moreover, TC-peptide forms monomeric helices that are relatively less stable. The absence of significant helicity in aqueous solution and the lack of intermolecular association of peptide molecules suggest that formation of TC-peptide from its constituent fragments would not result in appreciable reduction in excluded volume in crowded media. The failure of V8 protease to catalyze the formation of TC-peptide in the presence of dextran or PEG under conditions similar (data not shown) to those used for the synthesis of LIAA or VLAA was consistent with this idea. Next we studied the effect of macromolecular crowding on enzymatic re-synthesis of hydrolyzed peptide bonds in proteins. RNase A and TIM were chosen as a model system to explore if the volume exclusion effect or the propensity of the crowding molecules to strengthen the associative interactions between non-covalently held segments could facilitate the protease-catalyzed splicing of discontinuity sites in fragment complementing systems. Although several examples of such systems are known (11Chaiken I.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 11: 255-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Richards F.M. Vithayathil P.J. J. Biol.

Soc. 1994; 116: 11164-11165Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), thus precluding protease-related contributions, if any, in the synthetic reaction; (b) whereas RNase S has predominantly two interacting fragments (10Homandberg G.A. Laskowski Jr., M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Richards F.M. Vithayathil P.J. J. Biol.

Chmielewski J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11164-11165Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Ray S.S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 625-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); (c) native TIM assumes highly stable and compact α8/β8 (TIM) barrel structure and exists as a homodimer (monomer mass, ∼27 kDa). On the other hand, native RNase A is a relatively small protein (∼14 kDa) and remains largely monomeric in solution. The formation of RNase A from RNase S is not expected to produce significant changes in excluded volume in view of the fact that the two forms of RNase exhibit almost superimposable crystal structures. Nonetheless, crowding may enforce the association of S-peptide and S-protein in the RNase S complex. Apparently, the above two protein systems exhibit common yet hierarchical structural features that might elicit distinct volume exclusion effects. Importantly, it is known that subtilisin can catalyze the reformation of both the proteins, TIM and RNase A, from their respective digest in the presence of organic cosolvents such as acetonitrile or glycerol (10Homandberg G.A. Laskowski Jr., M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Vogel K. Chmielewski J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11164-11165Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This could serve as a control for the present studies of reverse proteolysis in macromolecular crowded media. The SDS-PAGE profile (Fig. 9 A) of a limited digest of rabbit muscle TIM (Lane 3) by subtilisin produced at least six to eight fragments in the range of 9 to 15 kDa. No band corresponding to the native TIM was present in the proteolyzed mixture, suggesting that the TIM was completely digested.

https://openalex.org/W1986825997,"RNA polymerase II core subunit 3 (RPB3) is an a-like core subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II). It is selectively down-regulated upon treatment with doxorubicin (dox). Due to the failure of skeletal muscle cells to differentiate when exposed to dox, we hypothesized that RPB3 is involved in muscle differentiation. To this end, we have isolated human muscle RPB3-interacting proteins by using yeast two-hybrid screening. It is of interest that an interaction between RPB3 and the myogenic transcription factor myogenin was identified. This interaction involves a specific region of RPB3 protein that is not homologous to the prokaryotic a subunit. Although RPB3 contacts the basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) region of myogenin, it does not bind other HLH myogenic factors such as MyoD, Myf5, and MRF4. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that myogenin contacts the pol II complex and that the RPB3 subunit is responsible for this interaction. We show that RPB3 expression is regulated during muscle differentiation. Exogenous expression of RPB3 slightly promotes myogenin transactivation activity and muscle differentiation, whereas the region of RPB3 that contacts myogenin, when used as a dominant negative molecule (Sud), counteracts these effects. These results indicate for the first time that the RPB3 pol II subunit is involved in the regulation of tissue-specific transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2029999536,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV encodes an oncogenic HBx gene that functions as a transcriptional coactivator of multiple cellular genes. To understand the role(s) of HBx in the early genesis of HCC, we systematically analyzed gene expression profiles by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) in freshly isolated human primary hepatocytes infected with a replication-defective adenovirus containing HBx. A total of 19,501 sequence tags (representing 1443 unique transcripts) were analyzed, which provide a distribution of a transcriptome characteristic of normal hepatocytes and a profile associated with HBx expression. Examples of the targeted genes were confirmed by the Megarray analysis with a significant correlation between quantitative SAGE and Megarray (r = 0.8, P < 0.005). In HBx-expressing hepatocytes, a total of 57 transcripts (3.9%) were induced, and 46 transcripts (3.3%) were repressed by more than fivefold. Interestingly, most of the HBx-up-regulated transcripts can be clustered into three major classes, including genes that encode ribosomal proteins, transcription factors with zinc-finger motifs, and proteins associated with protein degradation pathways. These results suggest that HBx may function as a major regulator in common cellular pathways that, in turn, regulate protein synthesis, gene transcription, and protein degradation."

Bisphosphorylation of TnI reduces the affinity of the regulatory site on troponin C (TnC) for Ca2+ by increasing the rate of Ca2+ dissociation. What remains unclear is how the phosphorylation signal is transmitted from one subunit of troponin to another. We have produced a series of mutations in the N-terminal extension of TnI designed to further our understanding of the mechanisms involved. The ability of phosphorylation of the mutant TnIs to affect Ca2+ sensitivity has been assessed. We find that the Pro residues found in a conserved (Xaa-Pro)4 motif N-terminal to the phosphorylation sites are not required for the effect of the N-terminal extension on Ca2+ binding in the presence or absence of phosphorylation. Our experiments also reveal that the full effects of phosphorylation are seen even when residues 1–15 of TnI are deleted. If further residues are removed, not only does the effect of phosphorylation diminish but deletion of the N-terminal extension mimics phosphorylation. We propose that TnI residues 16–29 bind to TnC stabilizing the “open” Ca2+-bound state.

Binding of Ca2+to the single “regulatory” site of cardiac TnC alone is not sufficient to stabilize the open conformation of the N-terminal domain in the absence of TnI (2Sia S.K., Li, M.X.

However, in the presence of TnI and Ca2+ the N-terminal domain of cardiac TnC also adopts the open conformation (5Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although we do not yet have atomic resolution structures of TnI and TnT, much information has been afforded by studies with fragments and mutants of these proteins. TnI is an extended molecule that adopts an antiparallel orientation to TnC in the binary complex (6Dong W.-J. Xing J. Solaro J.R. Cheung H.C. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Fig. 1 shows the aligned sequences of the N-terminal extensions of the mammalian cardiac TnIs sequenced to date (8Ausoni S. Campione M. Picard A. Moretti P. Vitadello M., De Nardi C. Schiaffino S. J.

C-terminal to the extension, residues 33–80 of cardiac TnI form an α-helix that binds extremely tightly to the C-terminal domain of TnC (13Gasmi-Seabrook G. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E.

This is followed by a putative TnT binding site and then the “inhibitory” (115–131) and “regulatory” (147–163) regions (5Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D.

These latter regions bind to Ca2+-saturated TnC but, in the absence of Ca2+, bind to actin-anchoring troponin and tropomyosin in the “blocked state” of the McKillop and Geeves (16McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) model of thin filament regulation. Serines 22 and 23 of cardiac TnI are phosphorylated by PKA in response to β-adrenergic stimulation of the heart. This bisphosphorylation desensitizes the thin filaments to Ca2+ by 0.2–0.4pCa units (17Dohet C., Al- Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Ray K.P. England P.J. FEBS Lett. 1976; 70: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Robertson S.P. Johnson D.J.

Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The faster release of Ca2+ produces faster relaxation of skinned fibers upon rapid Ca2+ chelation (20Zhang R. Zhao J.J. Mandveno A. Potter J.D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This enhanced relaxation, in conjunction with increased Ca2+ re-uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, may help maintain proper diastolic function at increased heart rates. Despite intensive efforts, it remains unclear how the phosphorylation signal is transmitted from the N-terminal extension of TnI to the regulatory Ca2+ binding site in the N-terminal domain of TnC, especially in view of the antiparallel orientation of the two proteins. 1H NMR experiments on peptides corresponding to regions of the N-terminal extension show that the unphosphorylated extension is highly flexible but that bisphosphorylation increases the number of conformational restraints with residues 24–29 adopting a looped conformation (21Keane N.E.

Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 1H and 31P NMR on these peptides or whole TnI indicates that phosphoserine 23 interacts with Arg21, whereas phosphoserine 22 behaves as if free in solution (22Jaquet K.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13873-13878Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In bisphosphorylated troponin the phosphate groups are in a more acidic environment than in isolated TnI, which suggests that the phosphorylated extension may interact weakly with another component of troponin. However, the narrow31P line widths observed were interpreted to indicate that the phosphate groups themselves are not involved in specific bond formation (23Jaquet K. Korte K. Schnackerz K. Vyska K. Heilmeyer L.M.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13873-13878Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Isolated TnI and the TnI·TnC complex both adopt a more compact shape upon phosphorylation (24Liao R. Wang C.-K. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 986-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments have shown that the extreme N-terminal region of a S5C mutant TnI labeled with 2-(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino)napthalene-6-sulfonic acid (IAANS) moves 10–12 Å toward the rest of TnI (25Dong W.-J. Chandra M. Xing J. She M. Solaro J.R. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6754-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Binding experiments using peptides corresponding to the N-terminal extension have shown that the unphosphorylated form will bind to TnC, whereas the phosphorylated form does not (21Keane N.E.

The peptide work is supported by NMR and cross-linking data, which indicate that the unphosphorylated N-terminal extension contacts the N-terminal domain of TnC in both TnI·TnC binary complex and in whole troponin (28Abbot M.B.

Bisphosphorylation results in a change in the net charge on the N-terminal extension from +2 to −2, and it is likely that this significantly alters the properties of the extension. Replacement of serines 22 and 23 with negatively charged Asp residues mimics the effects of phosphorylation in skinned fibers (17Dohet C., Al- Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but does not produce the same conformational change in a TnI peptide (residues 19–29) as phosphorylation (21Keane N.E. Quirke P.G. Gao Y. Patchell V.B. Perry S.V. Levine B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the phosphorylation signal is transmitted from TnI to TnC by alterations in a direct interaction between the N-terminal extension and the N-terminal domain of TnC. We now investigate the minimal structural requirements of the N-terminal extension required for successful transmission of the phosphorylation signal. It has been shown that (Xaa-Pro)n sequences favor an extended rigid conformation of the polypeptide chain (32Bhandari D. Levine B.A. Trayer I.P. Yeadon M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Brewer S. Tolley M. Trayer I.P. Barr G. Dorman C.J. Hannavy C.F. Evans J.S. Levine B.A. Wormwald M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We initially set out to test whether the (Xaa-Pro)4 sequence found in the N-terminal extension acts as a rigid spacer arm (residues 10–17) conducting localized phosphorylation-induced conformational changes toward the N terminus of TnI. This might alter any protein-protein interactions formed by the extreme N terminus (residues 1–9) of TnI. Our results indicate that this is not the case, because Pro → Ala mutations in this region do not alter the ability of bisphosphorylation to produce two of its characteristic effects: desensitization of actomyosin ATPase activity toward Ca2+ and acceleration of Ca2+ release from troponin labeled at Cys35 of TnC with IAANS. We have also progressively deleted residues from the N terminus of TnI leading to three major conclusions: 1) residues 1–15 do not play a major role in transmitting the phosphorylation signal to TnC, 2) residues 16–18 are required for the full effect, and 3) deletion of residues 16–29 mimics phosphorylation. The implications of these findings are discussed later. Recombinant human cardiac TnC, TnI, TnT, and α-tropomyosin were used in this study and purified as previously described (34Ward D.G. Ashton P.R. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Maytum R. Konrad M. Lehrer S.L. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). pET11c(TnC) and pET11c(TnI) constructs were provided by Dr. E. Al-Hillawi, and pET11c(TnT) and pET11c(TM) constructs were provided by E. Austin and B. Wright, respectively. Skeletal TnT, actin, and myosin were purified as described previously (36Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Trayer I.P. Perry S.V. Biochem. Z. 1966; 345: 87-100Google Scholar). All protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) calibrated with bovine serum albumin. Oligonucleotide primers were produced by Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham) and DNA-sequenced at the Functional Genomics facility (University of Birmingham, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences and Research Council 6/JIF13209). Bovine PKA (catalytic subunit) was obtained from Sigma. IAANS was from Molecular Probes. [γ-33P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase was from Invitrogen. All other DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England BioLabs, andEscherichia coli strains were from Novagen. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis by PCR using 5′-primers with an NdeI site and 3′-primers with aBamHI site was as described previously (38Al-Hillawi E. Minchin S.D. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, base pair substitutions were achieved by mega-primer synthesis by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, followed by a second PCR to extend the DNA to the whole coding region. The N-terminal deletions of TnI were prepared via a single PCR reaction. FollowingBamHI/NdeI digestion, the PCR products were ligated into pET11c and transformed into competent E. coliJM101 cells. Successful clones were screened for by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Proteins were overexpressed in E. coli Rosetta cells and purified by ion exchange chromatography in “urea buffer” (8 m urea, 25 mmtriethanolamine/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) as previously described (38Al-Hillawi E. Minchin S.D. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein purity (>95%) and identity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry (34Ward D.G. Ashton P.R. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The troponin was prepared by mixing TnC, TnI, and TnT in a 1:1:1 ratio in urea buffer followed by extensive dialysis against “ATPase buffer” (25 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS/KOH (pH 7.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol). PKA was also dialyzed against ATPase buffer. Assay conditions were: 4 μm actin, 1 μm tropomyosin, 1 μm troponin, 0.1 μm myosin, 3 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and CaCl2 to give the requiredpCa. Prior to addition of the myosin to the reactions, the reaction mix was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with or without 50 units of PKA/ml. In all experiments the paired ± PKA reaction mixes were prepared and assayed in parallel. Following addition of myosin, ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the Pi released during a 15-min incubation at 30 °C. The Pi assay was adapted to 96-well plate format from Bilmen et al. (39Bilmun J.G. Khan S.Z. Javed M. Michelangeli F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6318-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar): the 50-μl ATPase reactions were stopped by the addition of 150 μl of chilled 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 4.0), 0.25% (w/v) copper sulfate. This was followed by 25 μl of 5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate and 25 μl of 5% (w/v) sodium sulfite, 2% (w/v)p-methylaminophenol sulfate. The absorbance at 850 nm was determined after 10 min at room temperature. Control experiments showed that the absorbance was linearly proportional to the Piconcentration, that Pi release was linear during our ATPase experiments, and that the percentage of ATP hydrolyzed did not exceed 25%. A C84S mutant TnC was labeled at Cys-35 with IAANS by dissolving in 6 m urea, 25 mm triethanolamine/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA and incubating at 4 °C overnight with a 5-fold molar excess of IAANS. Unincorporated IAANS was removed by dialysis. The IAANS-labeled TnC was then incorporated into troponin by mixing with TnI and TnT in a 1:1:1 ratio in urea buffer. The complex was extensively dialyzed against “stopped-flow buffer” (100 mm KCl, 20 mmMOPS/KOH (pH 7.0), 3 mm MgCl2, 50 μm CaCl2) and then diluted to 5 μm and 1 mm ATP added. PKA was also dialyzed against stopped-flow buffer. The troponin was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with or without 50 units PKA/ml. Finally, the troponin was diluted to 1 μm in stopped-flow buffer prior to use. The rate of Ca2+ release was measured from the fluorescence enhancement of IAANS fluorescence upon emptying Ca2+ from the regulatory site (40Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 850-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by rapid mixing with an excess of EGTA. This was achieved by mixing 90 μl of 1 μm troponin with 10 μl of 100 mm EGTA/KOH (pH 7.0) at 25 °C using anApplied Photophysics SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer equipped with a 400-nm filter (excitation at 325 nm). Rate constants were calculated by least squares fitting of the data to a single exponential function. Fig.2 shows a typical actomyosin ATPase activity versus pCa experiment. The mean (± S.E.) rates of ATP hydrolysis in our experiments were 2.5 ± 0.1 and 12.5 ± 0.4 nmol of Pi released s−1nmol−1 myosin at high and low pCa, respectively. The curves represent least-squares fits to the Hill equation, from which we obtain the pCa giving half maximal activity (pCa50). The meanpCa50 values from at least four repeats of the experiment were 6.35 for unphosphorylated troponin and 6.12 for bisphosphorylated troponin, i.e. phosphorylation reduces the pCa50 by 0.23 pCa units (ΔpCa50). This ΔpCa50value is within the range reported in the literature (17Dohet C., Al- Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Ray K.P.

Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The minimum and maximum ATPase activities and the cooperativity of regulation were not significantly altered by phosphorylation or by any of the mutations tested in this study. Control experiments (data not shown) using [γ-33P]ATP to phosphorylate the thin filaments followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated that the TnI was maximally phosphorylated (no increase in phosphorylation with longer incubation times) and that no other thin filament proteins were phosphorylated. The stopped-flow measurement of Ca2+ release from unphosphorylated and phosphorylated troponin containing wild type TnI and TnT and C84S TnC-IAANS is shown in Fig.3. In both cases the data is well fitted by a single exponential function. Ca2+ release is measured from the 2- to 3-fold increase in the fluorescence of the IAANS attached to inactive site I of TnC produced by emptying of site II. The mean rate constants obtained were 25.5 s−1 for unphosphorylated troponin and 33.0 s−1 for phosphorylated troponin. This ∼30% increase in the dissociation rate constant caused by TnI phosphorylation is somewhat less than the value of 45% reported in 1982 by Robertson et al. (19Robertson S.P. Johnson D.J. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine cardiac troponin but is large enough to easily and reliably measure. We produced single (P15A), double (P15A/P17A) and quadruple (P11A/P13A/P15A/P17A) Pro → Ala mutants of TnI. The rationale being that, if this region was acting as a rigid spacer arm, then replacement of the Pro residues with Ala would increase its flexibility and impair transmission of the phosphorylation signal. When treated with PKA, all three mutants incorporated phosphate to the same extent as wild type TnI (data not shown). The results of the ATPase and stopped-flow experiments are summarized in TablesI (a and b). All three mutants behave very much like wild type TnI with respect to the effects of phosphorylation: treatment with PKA produces a substantial shift to the right in the ATPase versus pCa plot and an increase in the Ca2+ dissociation rate constant. These results indicate that none of the four Pro residues is importantper se and that the stiffness of the postulated spacer arm region is not required to transmit the phosphorylation signal to TnC.Table IATPase and stopped-flow resultsa) ATPase results: Pro → Ala TnI mutantsTnIpCa50 − PKApCa50 + PKAΔpCa50P15A6.28 ± 0.026.08 ± 0.01−0.20P15A/P17A6.20 ± 0.026.00 ± 0.02−0.20P11A/P13A/P15A/P17A6.19 ± 0.046.05 ± 0.03−0.14b) Stopped-flow results: Pro → Ala TnI mutantsTnIk off − PKAk off + PKAIncreases−1%P15A25.8 ± 1.032.6 ± 0.826P15A/P17A25.3 ± 0.732.0 ± 1.026P11A/P13A/P15A/P17A28.7 ± 0.636.5 ± 1.327The effects of the Pro → Ala mutations of TnI and phosphorylation on the Ca2+ sensitivity of actomyosin ATPase activity (a) and Ca2+ dissociation rate (b).

In both cases the values shown are the mean (±S.E.) of four independent determinations. We constructed a series of TnI mutants with an increasing number of residues missing from the N terminus (−3, −6, −9, −13, −15, −16, −17, −18, −21, and −29). The deletions up to −18 were designed to test the role of the region of TnI N-terminal to the phosphorylation motif. All of the mutants up to and including −18 were phosphorylated by PKA at the same rate and to the same extent as wild type TnI (Fig. 4). The −21 mutant is not phosphorylated by PKA, because the Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser/Thr recognition motif for PKA has been disrupted (see Fig. 1), and in the −29 mutant the phosphorylation sites are deleted. The −21 and −29 mutants were designed to: 1) act as a control so that all the observed effects were actually due to phosphorylation of serines 22 and 23 and 2) test the effect of removing the whole of the N-terminal extension. The pCa50 values obtained in the ATPase experiments with the N-terminal deletion mutants of TnI are listed in Table II and plotted against the number of residues deleted in Fig. 5. The ΔpCa50 upon phosphorylation is substantial (>0.12 pCa units) for all the deletion mutants up to and including −15. This shows that residues 1–15 play only a minor role if, any, in the transmission of the phosphorylation signal. Deletions C-terminal to Pro15 reduce the ability of phosphorylation to produce a desensitization to Ca2+ indicating an importance for residues 16–18. As one would predict, PKA treatment has no effect on the −21 and −29 mutants. However, as we remove residues C-terminal to Pro15 we see a desensitization to Ca2+ in the unphosphorylated state that mimics the effect of phosphorylation. Thus, it would appear that residues 16–29 of TnI are responsible for holding cardiac troponin in the high Ca2+ affinity unphosphorylated conformation.Table IIATPase results: N-terminal deletions of TnITnIpCa50 − PKApCa50+ PKAΔpCa50wt6.35 ± 0.036.12 ± 0.04−0.23−36.36 ± 0.046.16 ± 0.05−0.20−66.30 ± 0.056.15 ± 0.04−0.15−96.31 ± 0.056.17 ± 0.05−0.14−136.30 ± 0.036.18 ± 0.03−0.12−156.28 ± 0.076.15 ± 0.06−0.13−166.18 ± 0.066.12 ± 0.06−0.06−176.21 ± 0.046.15 ± 0.04−0.06−186.16 ± 0.036.10 ± 0.03−0.06−216.08 ± 0.026.07 ± 0.02−0.01−296.03 ± 0.036.03 ± 0.030Actomyosin ATPase results obtained with N-terminal deletion mutants of TnI.

The values shown are the mean (±S.E.) of at least four independent determinations. Stopped-flow measurement of Ca2+ release was used to confirm the effects of phosphorylation on the deletion mutants. The dissociation rate constants are presented in TableIII and are plotted against the number of residues deleted in Fig. 6. The trends in the data mirror those seen in the ATPase experiments. Up to 15 residues can be removed from the N terminus of TnI without inhibiting the ability of phosphorylation to accelerate Ca2+ release. We find that larger deletions (−18) halve the effect of phosphorylation on the Ca2+ off rate. The effect of deleting the N-terminal extension is to accelerate Ca2+ release mimicking the effects of phosphorylation as seen in the ATPase experiments. In fact, deleting the N-terminal extension is rather more effective at destabilizing Ca2+ binding than phosphorylation. These results show that it is the unphosphorylated form of the N-terminal extension that actively stabilizes Ca2+ binding and not the phosphorylated form that destabilizes Ca2+ binding.Table IIIStopped-flow results: N-terminal deletions of TnITnIpCa50 − PKApCa50+ PKAIncrease%wt25.5 ± 0.633.0 ± 0.329−924.4 ± 0.332.4 ± 0.233−1525.5 ± 0.530.7 ± 0.620−1830.9 ± 1.035.8 ± 0.716−2132.8 ± 0.533.6 ± 0.42−2941.4 ± 0.641.2 ± 0.30Ca2+ dissociation rates from troponin reconstituted with TnI deletion mutants.

The values are the mean (±S.E.) of at least four independent determinations. TableIV shows the pCa50values obtained in ATPase experiments where the troponin was reconstituted using skeletal TnC or TnT rather than all three cardiac subunits. Replacing the cardiac TnT with skeletal TnT did not alter the ability of phosphorylation to produce a desensitization toward Ca2+. Skeletal TnT was also able to support the phosphorylation-induced acceleration of Ca2+ release (data not shown). These results indicate that the sequence differences of cardiac TnT with respect to skeletal TnT are not adaptations relating to the phosphorylation effect. However, when the cardiac TnC was replaced with the skeletal isoform, phosphorylation of the TnI was unable to alter Ca2+ sensitivity. This may be due to a specific effect, e.g. skeletal TnC not presenting a binding site for the N-terminal extension, or simply because the very different energetics of the skeletal TnC N-terminal domain (involving the binding of two Ca2+ ions rather than one) override the effects of phosphorylation.Table IVSkeletal isoform switchingIsoform switchpCa50 − PKApCa50 + PKAΔpCaSkeletal TnT6.21 ± 0.046.04 ± 0.05−0.17Skeletal TnC5.94 ± 0.025.95 ± 0.02+0.01Actomyosin ATPase results obtained with troponin in which the cardiac TnT or TnC have been replaced with the skeletal isoforms.

In our experiments we see clear effects of bisphosphorylation of cardiac TnI by PKA as previously reported (17Dohet C., Al- Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Ray K.P. England P.J. FEBS Lett. 1976; 70: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Robertson S.P. Johnson D.J. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bisphosphorylation increases the Ca2+dissociation rate from troponin by ∼30% and desensitizes actomyosin ATPase activity toward Ca2+ by ∼0.2 pCa units. We have used these effects to monitor the ability of mutations in the N-terminal extension of TnI to disrupt the transmission of the phosphorylation signal to the regulatory Ca2+ site in the N-terminal domain of TnC. The sequence of the N-terminal extension suggested to us that the conformational changes produced in the vicinity of the phosphoserine residues conformation (21Keane N.E. Quirke P.G. Gao Y. Patchell V.B. Perry S.V. Levine B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Jaquet K. Lohmann K. Czisch M. Holak T. Gulati J. Jaquet R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) might be transmitted via a rigid spacer arm to a TnC binding site in the first nine residues of TnI. We find, however, that this is not the case. The four Pro residues in the putative rigid spacer arm can be mutated to Ala without disrupting the effects of phosphorylation. Equally, residues 1–15 of TnI can be removed with little reduction in the effects of phosphorylation, leading us to conclude that the extreme N-terminal region of TnI (residues 1–15) is not required to transmit the phosphorylation signal to TnC. Amino acids equivalent to human cardiac TnI residues 1–9 are present in all mammalian cardiac TnIs sequenced to date but are less conserved between species than the rest of TnI (Fig. 1) and may play a role other than other than transmitting the phosphorylation signal. In 1991 Ikebe and Morita (41Ikebe M. Morita J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21339-21342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that removal of residues Arg13-Pro-Gln-Arg16 of smooth muscle regulatory light chain abolished the effects of myosin light chain kinase-mediated phosphorylation of serine 19 (without preventing phosphorylation). In TnI, however, removal of residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation sites only reduces but does not abolish the effect of phosphorylation: the effects of phosphorylation are severely reduced in the −16, −17, and −18 mutants. This suggests that Ala16, Pro17, and Ile18 may be involved in the transmission mechanism, although we note that mutation of Pro17 to Ala seems to be without effect. The phosphorylation of serines 22 and 23 introduces four negative charges into a positively charged region of the N-terminal extension. We therefore expected altered ionic interactions to underlie the effects of phosphorylation and were rather surprised that these relatively small hydrophobic residues attached to the N-terminal side of the bisphosphorylation motif were of much importance. They may, however, contribute directly to TnC binding or play a structural role in either the unphosphorylated or bisphosphorylated conformation of the N-terminal extension of TnI. An important observation in this study is that progressively deleting residues 16–29 very effectively mimics phosphorylation. This demonstrates that it is the unphosphorylated form of the N-terminal extension that is “active” in stabilizing Ca2+ binding at the regulatory site. This conclusion is the opposite of that reached by Wattanapermpool et al. (42Wattanapermpool J. Guo X.D. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1383-1391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in a comparison of wild type rat cardiac TnI with mouse cardiac TnI with residues 1–32 deleted. In skinned fiber experiments the −32 and full-length TnI gave the same ATPase and force versus pCa relationships. Their conclusion was that the phosphorylated extension is the active form that destabilizes the Ca2+-bound form of TnC. However, several lines of evidence argue against the bisphosphorylated species being the active form, including two studies on skinned fibers and one with reconstituted regulated actomyosin ATPase assays in which the −32 mutation shifts pCa relationships to the right by 0.1–0.3pCa units, mimicking phosphorylation (43Guo X.

Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, binding studies show that peptides corresponding to the N-terminal extension bind to TnC with an affinity of ∼105m−1 in the unphosphorylated state and that phosphorylation weakens this binding 100-fold (26Ferrieres G. Pugniere M. Mani J.C. Villard S. Laprade M. Doutre P. Pau B. Granier C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Calvert M.J. Trayer I.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 830Google Scholar). Two of these studies identify the TnC binding site on the N-terminal extension as between residues 16 and 29 (21) and 18 and 31 (26). These are exactly the residues that, when removed, mimic phosphorylation. Indeed, the fact that the affinity of whole TnI for TnC is reduced upon phosphorylation may result directly from the loss of the N-terminal extension's binding contribution (46Liao R. Wang C.-K. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12729-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A third line of evidence is that of elegant NMR studies carried out by Rosevear and coworkers (28Abbot M.B.

These experiments show that a fragment of cardiac TnI (TnI-(1–80)), containing the major TnC C-terminal domain binding site (within residues 33–80) and the N-terminal extension, makes contacts with the N-terminal domain of TnC (primarily in the inactive Ca2+ binding site I). These contacts are not seen if serines 22 and 23 are mutated to Asp, if the TnI-(1–80) is bisphosphorylated, or if the TnI-(1–80) is replaced with TnI-(30–80),i.e. if the N-terminal extension is deleted. They also showed that, in intact troponin, phosphorylation of TnI influenced the exchange between the open and closed conformations of the N-terminal domain of TnC and that, again, deletion of residues 1–30 mimicked phosphorylation. We propose that when TnI is unphosphorylated residues 16–28 of TnI bind to the N-terminal domain of TnC stabilizing the “open” Ca2+-bound conformation. Upon phosphorylation of serines 22 and 23, the introduction of negative charges and localized conformational changes within the N-terminal extension of TnI reduces its affinity for TnC relieving the stabilization of the open conformation and enhancing Ca2+ release. Residues 1–15 are not crucial in this mechanism, but removal of the predicted TnC binding region (residues 16–29) has exactly the same effect as phosphorylation. Further work is required to exactly define the interactions between residues 16–29 of TnI and TnC. Replacement of serines 22 and 23 with Ala has no effect on Ca2+ sensitivity (17Dohet C., Al- Hillawi E. Trayer I.P. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) indicating that the Ser side chains are not forming functionally important hydrogen bonds in unphosphorylated troponin. Our work suggests that residues in both regions 16–21 and 24–29 contribute to binding to TnC.

https://openalex.org/W2143547123,"This study explored the hypothesis that dietary salt promoted changes in renal expression of TGF-beta1 and NOS3 by modulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained for four days on formulated diets that contained 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 8.0% NaCl. An increase in salt intake to greater than or equal to 3.0% NaCl increased kinase activities of p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK, but not p46/54 JNK/SAPK, in the cortex and outer and inner medulla. Associated with this increased activity was a relative increase in the phosphorylated forms of the transcription factors ATF-2 and Elk-1. Compared with rats on 0.3% NaCl diet, glomerular preparations from rats on 8.0% NaCl diet contained more NOS3 and produced greater amounts of total and active TGF-beta1 and NOx. PD-098059, a MEK1 inhibitor, and SB-203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPKalpha-gamma, diminished NOS3 expression and production of TGF-beta1 and NOx. TEA, administered intravenously 5 min before harvesting kidneys of rats on the 8.0% NaCl diet, decreased activities of both p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK, compared with vehicle-treated animals. Thus, an increase in dietary salt activated through a TEA-sensitive pathway the p38 MAPK and p42/44 MAPK signaling cascades, which promoted the increase in glomerular TGF-beta1 and NOS3 expression."

Chl a is the primary electron donor in the reaction center of the two photosystems and also serves as a light-harvesting pigment. In higher plants, both Chla and b are bound to the light-harvesting complex (LHC), which is encoded by a multi-gene family of cab genes (1Kühlbrandt W. Wang D. Yoshinori F. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar, 2Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). However, cyanobacteria synthesize Chl a but not Chlb, and they do not contain Cab proteins (LHC or related Chla/b-binding peripheral antenna proteins), with the exception of small Cab-like proteins (SCPs) that have a single membrane-spanning region similar to the first and third transmembrane regions of Cab proteins (3Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Chl b is synthesized from Chl a or its precursors through the activity of Chl a oxygenase (CAO), and the gene encoding CAO has been identified (4Tanaka A. Ito H. Tanaka R. Tanaka N.K. Yoshida K. Okada K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12719-12733Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 5Espineda C.E. Linford A.S. Devine D. Brusslan J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Goodwin T.W. Plant Pigments. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1988: 1-59Google Scholar). Some enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway have a rather low substrate specificity. For example, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase can tolerate several modifications of the substrate at rings A and B (7Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J.

Soc. 1996; 118: 2606-2611Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, oxygenation of any of the possible substrates may lead to Chl b as the final product. Hemes, phycobilins, and Chls are derived from the tetrapyrrole protoporphyrin IX that is produced from δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). In plants and some bacteria (including cyanobacteria), ALA is synthesized via a pathway starting from glutamate (10Timko M.P. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1998: 377-414Google Scholar). Ferrochelatase catalyzes the introduction of iron into protoporphyrin IX, leading to the production of heme and phycobilins, whereas the introduction of magnesium by magnesium chelatase is the first committed step on the Chl biosynthesis pathway. The enzymes catalyzing porphyrin synthesis reactions generally have been identified, but the mechanisms regulating the flow of metabolites through these pathways in response to changing environmental conditions remain unclear. Recently, several SCPs inSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were shown to regulate the early steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis as a function of pigment availability (11Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Chl biosynthesis pathway leads to the synthesis of protochlorophyllide (PChlide) via magnesium-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-proto IX) and magnesium-protoporphyrin IX methyl ester (Mg-proto IX ME). PChlide is reduced to chlorophyllide, which is phytylated to form Chl. In cyanobacteria, PChlide reduction proceeds via two pathways: NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase catalyzes the light-dependent reduction, and the ChlLBN complex catalyzes this reduction independent of the presence of light (12Fujita Y. Takahashi Y. Chuganji M. Matsubara H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 81-92Google Scholar, 13Fujita Y. Matsumoto H. Takahashi Y. Matsubara H.

Chl degradation takes place during the turnover of Chl or upon cell death (15Takamiya K. Tsuchiya T. Ohta H. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Rapid degradation of free Chl or its colored derivatives is necessary to avoid cell damage by their photodynamic action. The mechanism and regulation of this degradation is largely unknown, although much progress regarding the identification of degradation intermediates has been made in the past several years (16Matile P. Hörtensteiner S. Thomas H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 67-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 17Hörtensteiner S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 330-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant has been generated that lacks the light-independent pathway of PChlide reduction, and therefore, this strain synthesizes Chl in a light-dependent manner (18Wu Q. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This mutant has also been generated in a photosystem (PS) I-less background, which contains only 15–20% of the amount of Chl present in wild type (19Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Upon introduction and overexpression of pealhcb and Arabidopsis cao genes into thisSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain, a PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain resulted. This strain contained more Chl b thana and had a large amount of Chl b in the PS II core complex (20Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14168-14173Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Judging from the growth rate, the oxygen evolving ability, and the Chl content on a per-cell basis, the presence of Chl b poses little difficulty under normal growth conditions. Some if not most of the Chl binding sites in the PS II core complex appear to have little substrate specificity and are able to functionally accommodate Chl b. We use this system to study the regulation of Chl biosynthesis and Chl degradation in the presence of Chl b. In this study, we demonstrate that the presence of Chl b disturbs tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and enhances Chl degradation. The Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 PS I-less/chlL− control strain and the Chlb-containing PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain (20Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14168-14173Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were grown at 30 °C at a light intensity of 5-μmol photons m−2 s−1 (unless indicated otherwise) in BG-11 medium (21Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) buffered with 5 mm TES-NaOH (pH 8.0) supplemented with 5 mm glucose. When strains were grown in liquid culture under light-activated heterotrophic growth (LAHG) conditions (22Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells were kept in complete darkness with the exception of one 15-min light period (white light at 20-μmol photons m−2 s−1) every 24 h. For growth on plates, 1.5% (w/v) Difco agar and 0.3% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate were added, and BG-11 was supplemented with antibiotics appropriate for the particular strain. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density of the cells at 730 nm using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer. Cells were propagated for 2 weeks under LAHG conditions and were taken in the middle of the 23.75-h dark period during their exponential growth phase (A 730∼0.2). Subsequently, 4 mm ALA and 40 mm TES-NaOH (pH 8.2) buffer were added to the cultures. After a given period of dark incubation in the presence of ALA, cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Pigments were extracted from cell pellets concentrated from 90-ml cultures by three successive extractions with methanol containing 0.1% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide. Supernatants were combined, and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen until the samples were dry. Dried samples were stored at −80 °C for up to 24 h. The extracts were redissolved in a small volume of NH4OH-containing methanol and immediately subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis on an HP-1100 Chemstation using a Waters Spherisorb S5ODS2 (250 × 4.0 mm) column filled with C-18 reverse phase silica gel. A 15-min gradient of ethyl acetate (0–100%) in acetonitrile:water:triethylamine (9:1:0.01, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min was used to elute the HPLC column for Chl detection. To detect less hydrophobic tetrapyrrole compounds, a 28-min linear gradient of 30–100% acetonitrile:water:triethylamine (9:1:0.01, v/v/v) in water at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was added before a 6-min gradient of ethyl acetate (0–100%) in acetonitrile:water:triethylamine (9:1:0.01, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The spectra of the eluted pigments were recorded continuously in the range of 350–710 nm. An additional 1-min wash with 100% acetonitrile:water:triethylamine (9:1:0.01, v/v/v) was carried out between the two gradients. PChlide b was collected after HPLC analysis. Solvents were evaporated under nitrogen, and dry PChlideb was stored at −20 °C in the dark. Mass spectra were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager DE STR Biospectrometry Work Station, Foster City, CA). Before analysis, 10 μg of PChlide b was mixed with terthiophene (used as a matrix) dissolved in acetone. Protoheme determinations were carried out essentially as described (23Stillman L.C. Gassman M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells harvested from a 400-ml culture were broken in 3-ml basic acetone (acetone:water:0.1N-ammonium hydroxide (9:2:1 v/v/v)) with a BeadBeater using six breaking cycles (30-s shaking followed by 3–5-min cooling on ice). Subsequently, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant containing extracted Chl, carotenoids, and other non-covalently bound pigments was discarded. The pellet containing protoheme, cell debris, and glass beads was extracted with 3-ml acetone containing 2% HCl three times; each extraction included 10-s shaking with a BeadBeater and centrifugation at 4 °C for 2 min. The supernatants were combined to which 4.5 ml of peroxide-free diethyl ether was added followed by 23 ml of deionized water. The ether phase was carefully taken and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Subsequently, 1 ml of pyridine, 0.4 ml of 1 N NaOH, and deionized water were added to a final volume of 4 ml. The protoheme concentration was determined by recording the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum on a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer with an alkaline-pyridine solution as described previously (23Stillman L.C. Gassman M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 10 mm phenanthroline was supplemented toChlamydomonas cells, which had been cultured in darkness at 25 °C for 3 days. Cells were then allowed to grow for 1 h in darkness at 38 °C (24Bednarik D.P. Hoober J.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Pheide b was extracted from the culture medium with ethyl acetate:acetic acid 3:1 (v/v) as described by Sager and Granick (25Sager R. Granick S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1953; 56: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) with the exception that the concentration of phosphate (K2HPO4, 3.0 mm, KH2PO4, 7.0 mm) was higher. Because of the low pH upon extraction, pheide b was protonated, which would affect the HPLC retention time. Therefore, pheideb was dried, and the dry standard was resuspended in BG-11 before it was subjected to HPLC analysis. The substrate specificity of CAO under in vivo conditions is still an open question. One experiment that may contribute toward its answer is to determine whether an unusual intermediate in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway appears in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao + Synechocystis strain in which Chl b is the major Chl (20Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14168-14173Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain and the PS I-less/chlL− control strain were propagated under LAHG conditions for a week, Chl was depleted and PChlide accumulated in accordance to what was observed inchlL− strains (18Wu Q. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were then extracted with basic methanol and subjected to HPLC analysis. As shown in Fig.1 A, a small peak at 6.8 min was found in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain but not in the control. Its absorption spectrum (Fig.1 B) was identical to that of PChlide b. Its abundance was ∼10% of that of PChlide a in the strain. To verify the identity of PChlide b, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was carried out on HPLC-purified PChlide b from the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao + Synechocystis strain. As shown in Fig.2, the major peak was atm/z 626.14, corresponding to PChlideb, and had the same isotopic distribution as expected from the chemical formula of PChlide b.Figure 2Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrum of PChlide b.

Hoober J.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is eluted (Fig.1 A, trace 3), and with an absorption spectrum identical to that of pheide b (Fig. 1 C) was observed in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain but not in the control. On the basis of these characteristics, this new peak is assigned to pheide b. To investigate whether the presence of Chl b affects Chl degradation kinetics, cultures of control (PS I-less/chlL−) and PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strains were transferred to LAHG conditions and samples from these cultures were harvested daily for 2 weeks and subjected to pigment analysis. The results are shown in Fig.3 A. In the control strain on a per-cell basis, Chl a was depleted with a half-time of approximately 26 h, which approximates the doubling time of this strain under LAHG conditions. This suggests that Chl is diluted by the growth of the cells and not much is degraded. Alternatively, the synthesis and degradation rates of Chl a are equal at least for the first few days, assuming that some Chl synthesis takes place inchlL− cells grown under LAHG conditions. In contrast, in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain, the total Chl content decreased with a half-time of ∼15 h, even though the growth rate of this strain remained the same as the control during the first week of growth under LAHG conditions. Chlb disappeared at essentially the same rate as Chla. Interestingly, no Chl was detectable in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain after 5 days of growth under LAHG conditions, whereas in the control strain, approximately 5–10% of the original Chl level remained. The reason for the rapid decrease in the Chl amount and for the lack of remaining Chl in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain after several days of growth under LAHG conditions may be either faster Chl degradation or slower Chl synthesis in this strain. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cells were grown in total darkness for up to 4 days to eliminate the Chl biosynthesis that may occur during the daily 15-min illumination under LAHG conditions. During the incubation in total darkness, no fresh medium was added and the same volume of culture was subjected to pigment analysis every day. Under these conditions, the Chl synthesis rate inchlL− strain is probably very low (26He Q. Brune D. Nieman R. Vermaas W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and primarily the Chl degradation rate is measured. As shown in Fig.3 B, in the control strain, Chl a was quite stable and the degradation half-time was ∼4 days. In contrast, in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain, the total Chl level decreased much faster (the half-time was <1 day); there was no significant difference in the degradation rates of Chl a and b. PChlide is the major tetrapyrrole intermediate that accumulates in the LAHG-grown PS I-less/chlL− cells. The accumulation kinetics of total PChlide (monovinyl + divinyl PChlide a) in the PS I-less/chlL− and PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strains during growth under LAHG conditions are shown in Fig.4 A. In the PS I-less/chlL− control strain, the PChlide level exhibited a linear increase during the 13-day period of growth under LAHG conditions. Surprisingly, the accumulation of PChlide ain the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain followed a much different pattern where the PChlidea level increased rapidly within the first 3 days after transfer to LAHG conditions and decreased gradually after day 3. Interestingly, the maximum PChlide a level in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain grown under LAHG conditions for 3 days was approximately the same as that in the control strain after LAHG growth for 2 weeks. The accumulation patterns of monovinyl- and divinyl-PChlide awere similar to that of total PChlide (data not shown). The accumulation profile of PChlide b in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain was very similar to that of PChlide awith the exception that it showed a 2–4-day delay and the level of accumulation was ∼10-fold lower than that of PChlidea (Fig. 4 B). PChlide b started to accumulate 3 days after cells had been transferred to LAHG conditions. The PChlide b level reached its maximum around day 7 and then decreased gradually. The altered PChlide accumulation kinetics in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain grown under LAHG conditions may originate from altered regulation of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. To determine whether the regulation of this pathway was altered at one of the early steps, ALA was added to PS I-less/chlL− and PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +cells that had been grown under LAHG conditions for 2 weeks and changes in the levels of tetrapyrrole synthesis intermediates were monitored. As shown in Fig. 5, ALA addition to the PS I-less/chlL− control strain caused a slow increase in the PChlide concentration, and after 2 days, the PChlide level had increased 3-fold compared with before ALA feeding, whereas the Mg-proto IX level showed an increase of ∼2-fold. However, the Mg-proto IX level in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain increased ∼60-fold in response to ALA supplementation, whereas the PChlide level did not increase more than a factor of 2. Little difference was detected in the levels of other major tetrapyrrole intermediates including Mg-proto IX ME and uroporphyrin between the PS I-less/chlL− and PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strains in response to ALA supplementation (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that regulation of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis has been altered significantly as a result of the introduction ofcao and lhcb genes. As protoheme is known to be a powerful feedback inhibitor of the early steps of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway (27Thomas J. Weinstein J.D. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 285-292Google Scholar), protoheme levels were also determined in the PS I-less/chlL− and PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strains upon ALA supplementation. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the protoheme level in the PS I-less/chlL− control strain almost doubled within 2 days of ALA addition, whereas this increase was much less pronounced in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain. These results suggest that the relative strength of the heme biosynthesis pathway in comparison to that of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway is not a major factor to explain the difference in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis intermediate levels in the two strains. The data presented above indicate that the presence of Chl b, PChlideb, or other b-type pigments affects the accumulation of Chl intermediates in darkness inchlL− strains. The next question is whether Chl synthesis upon transfer to light is affected as well. As indicated in Fig. 6, when the PS I-less/chlL− and PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strains had been grown under LAHG conditions for 2 weeks and were then illuminated with continuous light at 0.5-μmol photons m−2 s−1 (inducing light-dependent PChlide reduction by NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase), the rate of total Chl biosynthesis in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain was ∼20% of that in the control. It took the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain approximately 200 h of illumination to reach the steady-state Chl level observed in continuous light, whereas this process took only ∼40 h in the control. Interestingly, Chla and b were synthesized at approximately the same rate. Chl a andb differ only at position 3 (ring B) where Chl acarries a methyl group and Chl b carries an aldehyde group. The aldehyde group in Chl b arises from the methyl group present in Chl a and its precursors by the introduction of oxygen (28Schneegurt M.A. Beale S.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11677-11683Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Porra R.J. Schäfer W. Cmiel E. Katheder I. Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In vitro, CAO can catalyze the conversion of Chlide a to Chlide b although at a low rate (30Oster U. Tanaka R. Tanaka A. Rüdiger W. Plant J. 2000; 21: 305-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suitability of PChlide a as a substrate for CAO has been debated. Traces of PChlide b, the oxygenation product of PChlide a, were reported to occur in several green plants (31Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no PChlide b was found in etioplasts from barley, wheat, oat, and tobacco (32Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although the data of in vitro experiments suggested that a 5:1 ratio of PChlide b/a could be accommodated in a PChlidea/b-binding protein complex isolated from barley etioplasts (33Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is little or no precedence for the occurrence of PChlide b under in vivoconditions. No PChlide b was detected in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain grown in the light. However, when the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain was grown under LAHG conditions, PChlide b started to accumulate around day 4 and reached a peak value at around day 7. At that time, the amount of PChlide b was ∼15% of that of PChlide a (Fig. 4). In the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain, the accumulation kinetics of PChlide b were similar to those of PChlide a but with a delay of several days. This finding suggests that PChlide a can be a substrate for CAO, but the long delay in the conversion of PChlide a to PChlideb indicates that the conversion is very slow. Therefore, PChlide a does not appear to be an efficient substrate for CAO. The delay of PChlideb accumulation in comparison with that of PChlidea in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain transferred to LAHG conditions suggests that PChlideb is formed very slowly, and as it accumulates to some degree, it does not turn over rapidly. Both PChlides a andb disappear with a half-time of approximately 3 days in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain, suggesting that this disappearance reflects the stability of PChlide in this strain if further PChlide synthesis is blocked. Indeed, the inhibition of PChlide synthesis after 4 days of LAHG growth is very probable in this mutant. PChlide levels remain very low, and Mg-proto IX levels increase after the addition of ALA (Fig. 5), indicative of a blockage between Mg-proto IX and PChlide in this strain after a few weeks of growth under LAHG conditions. Another striking difference between the PS I-less/chlL− and PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain is the large difference in chlorophyll stability in darkness. In the control strain, chlorophyll a is stable and has a half-time of 3–4 days (Fig. 3 A), whereas in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain, both Chl a and Chl b disappear with a half-time of less than a day. The generally accepted pathway of Chl degradation includes dephytylation followed by dechelation and cleavage of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle by an oxygenase (referred to as pheidea oxygenase) (15Takamiya K. Tsuchiya T. Ohta H. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In plants, Chl b appears to enter the degradation pathway after conversion to Chlide avia chlorophyllase (leading to Chlide b) and Chlb reductase because no final degradation products of Chlb are found (34Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 35Folly P. Engel N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21811-21816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Scheumann V. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Planta. 1999; 209: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, pheide a is thought to be the sole substrate for pheide a oxygenase (37Hörtensteiner S. Vicentini F. Matile P. New Phytol. 1995; 129: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain of Synechocystis under LAHG conditions pheideb was found (Fig. 1), indicating that at least part of Chlb is not degraded via Chlide a, possibly because of a lack of Chl b reductase in this system. Interestingly, the Chl degradation in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain was faster than in the control, suggesting that the substrate specificity of pheide a oxygenase is not very high, but the accumulation of a measurable amount of pheide b and not pheide a in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain suggests that pheide a oxygenase does not recognize pheide b as efficiently as pheide a. A remaining open question is the reason for the decreased chlorophyll stability in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain, even in darkness. One possible explanation is that the presence of Chl b in PS II complexes destabilizes these complexes to some degree and that the degrading enzymes have better access to chlorophylls (both Chl a and Chl b) than in the control. Another possibility would be a more active Chl degradation system in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain because of an increased abundance of the corresponding enzymes. At this moment, we cannot distinguish between these possibilities, but the former explanation seems mechanistically more attractive. Tetrapyrrole derivatives including Mg2+-porphyrins (Chls), Fe2+-porphyrins (hemes), and bilins are critical components in essentially all organisms. The tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway is under the control of a complex regulation network, reflecting the varying needs for tetrapyrroles in response to different environmental conditions. The control can occur at several regulatory sites at different levels (38Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Physiol. Plant. 2002; 115: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Examples exist for regulation via end products or intermediates of the pathway or by proteins associated with these intermediates (11Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39Beale S.A. Weinstein J.D. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1990: 287-391Google Scholar, 40Johanningmeier U. Howell S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13541-13549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamyl-tRNA reductase (catalyzing the first committed step in the tetrapyrrole pathway) is of particular regulatory importance in photosynthetic systems. The enzyme is subject to strong feedback regulation (41Vothknecht U.C. Kannangara C.G. von Wettstein D. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and appears to turn over rapidly (42Kruse E. Grimm B. Beator J. Kloppstech K. Planta. 1997; 202: 235-241Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PChlide is the major tetrapyrrole intermediate that accumulates in the PS I-less/chlL− strain grown under LAHG conditions. In the PS I-less/chlL− control strain, the PChlide level steadily increases upon growth under LAHG conditions, indicating that the biosynthesis rate exceeds the rate of degradation. However, the accumulation of PChlide in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain can be divided into two stages: 1) an early stage (the first several days of growth under LAHG conditions) when a much larger flux goes through the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain versus the control and the rate of PChlide accumulation is 2.5-fold higher than in the control and 2) a late stage (in the second week of LAHG growth) when the flux through the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway is much slower. This finding suggests a major change in the regulation of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway, presumably mediated by the pigment-binding regulator(s) as a function of the presence ofb-type pigments. During the early stage of growth under LAHG conditions, the faster Chl degradation in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain may lead to empty sites on pigment-binding regulator(s), which may activate the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Otherb-type pigment(s) present and/or accumulated at a later stage of LAHG growth of the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain may have a higher binding affinity for the regulatory proteins than the a-type pigments and may occupy pigment binding sites of the regulatory protein, which leads to an erroneous signal to slow down the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. As will be discussed, the regulatory proteins may be small Cab-like proteins (SCPs). Also, the presence of b-type pigments may affect levels of SCPs or other regulatory proteins, i.e. the level of scptranscript and SCP proteins fluctuates as a function of growth conditions (3Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 43He Q. Dolganov M. Bjorkman O. Grossman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The PChlide level is a determinant of the rate of Chl synthesis upon transfer to continuous illumination (18Wu Q. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This provides an explanation for the slow Chl biosynthesis rate in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain upon illumination after growth under LAHG conditions (Fig. 6). This phenotype is surprisingly similar to that found in the PS I-less/chlL−/scpB− and PS I-less/chlL−/scpE−strains (11Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ScpB and ScpE are members of the SCP family that appear to regulate tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. An important question is the site(s) of inhibition of PChlide synthesis in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain upon growth under LAHG conditions for 2 weeks. The results obtained upon the addition of ALA appear to argue for inhibition at two sites in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Upon the addition of 4 mm ALA to an LAHG culture of the PS I-less/chlL− control strain, the levels of Mg-proto IX and PChlide increased slowly over the course of 2 days. However, when ALA was added to the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain grown under LAHG conditions, the Mg-proto IX level increased by ∼60-fold, whereas PChlide level increased by < 2-fold. This finding suggests that 1) ALA synthesis is inhibited in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain grown under LAHG conditions for 2 weeks, and 2) an additional inhibition occurs between Mg-proto IX and PChlide in this strain. This phenomenon is very similar to that observed when ALA was added to an LAHG culture of the PS I-less/chlL−/scpE−strain. In this case, the Mg-proto IX level increased 10-fold, whereas PChlide remained largely unchanged (11Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ferrochelatase catalyzes the first committed step in the heme branch of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Heme and Chl biosyntheses compete for a common substrate (protoporphyrin IX), and it is important to distribute the resources between the two branches according to the needs of cells. Interestingly, one of the SCPs (ScpA) is the C-terminal extension of ferrochelatase inSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (3Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and may provide a regulation mechanism for the relative activity of ferrochelatase versusmagnesium-chelatase. The protoheme level increased 2-fold in the PS I-less/chlL− strain upon ALA feeding, similar to the increase of other intermediates in the magnesium branch. However, when ALA was added to the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain grown under LAHG conditions, the protoheme level remained essentially the same, whereas the Mg-proto IX level increased 60-fold. This indicates that the regulation of the distribution of protoporphyrin IX between the two branches is altered by the presence of b-type pigments. At least two of the SCPs have been proposed to stimulate the Chl biosynthesis pathway when they do not have pigments bound to them (e.g., after growth of chlL− strains under LAHG conditions), whereas upon Chl binding to SCPs, this stimulation may disappear (11Xu H. Vavilin D. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain grown under LAHG conditions shows a phenotype consistent with the absence of stimulation by ScpB and ScpE. This may suggest that in the PS I-less/chlL−/lhcb +/cao +strain grown under LAHG conditions, an oxygenated (b-type) PChlide, Chlide, Chl, or pheide may have a higher affinity for one of the SCPs than the non-oxygenated (a-type) pigments present in the control. This may cause an altered regulation of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway in the presence of lhcband cao. At this moment, it is unclear what may be the nature of the pigment that may be tightly bound to the SCPs. However, it is unlikely that it is Chl b itself as it has virtually disappeared after several days of growth under LAHG conditions. Instead, the pigment may be one of the degradation products (such as pheide b) or PChlide b. The exact nature of this compound and of the interaction with SCPs or other proteins will be difficult to determine because of the low levels of these compounds. In any case, the results presented here provide support for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis regulation as a function of the pigment binding site(s) occupancy state of SCPs or other proteins of similar function. We thank Dr. Ken Hoober and Laura Eggink for their gift of the pheide b standard and Dr. Dan Brune for the mass spectroscopy measurements of PChlide b."

The electron transfer pathway, plastoquinol → Rieske ISP1 → cytochromef → plastocyanin or cytochrome c 6→ photosystem I on the lumen (p-side) of the membrane, comprises the high potential electron transport chain of the plastoquinol oxidase, whereas electron transfer between the twob-hemes, heme b p → hemeb n, to a putative n-side bound quinone defines the low potential chain. Absorption of a photon and charge separation in photosystem I causes the oxidation of cytochromef by plastocyanin (t 12 ≈ 200 μs,k 1(f­PC) ≈ 3000 s−1) (4Delosme R. Photosynth.

Only about half of the chemical content of cytochrome f is observed to turn over with this half-time after a short, 5-μs flash (8Whitmarsh J. Cramer W.A. Biophys.

Bowyer J.R. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 404-412Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with a rate constant, ∼104 s−1, presumably similar to the fast phase of reduction of cytochrome c 1 in thebc 1 complex (11Sadoski R.C. Engstrom G. Tian H. Zhang L., Yu, C.A., Yu, L. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4231-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Structure studies on the related cytochrome bc 1complex from bovine and avian mitochondria showed the extrinsic domain of the ISP and the [2Fe-2S] cluster itself in well separated conformations, which depend on the crystal form and the presence of inhibitors bound to the complex (12Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 13Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Robmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The two extreme positions of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, separated by ∼16 Å, are (i) proximal to the site (Qp) of the bound ubiquinol inhibitor analogue,e.g. stigmatellin, and the cytochrome bpolypeptide; and (ii) proximal to cytochrome c 1via the heme propionate of the π-bonded heme (12Zhang Z.

Neither of the individual conformations would allow the ISP to serve as both an electron acceptor for quinol oxidation and an electron donor to cytochrome c 1 (14Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The net 16-Å translation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster occurs as a result of a rotation of the globular extrinsic domain by ∼57° around an axis that includes the 9-residue peptide that links the globular extrinsic and transmembrane domains (12Zhang Z.

The inference that electron transfer mediated by the ISP in the cytochromebc 1 complex occurs via its rotational-translational movement between donor and acceptor sites, dependent upon flexibility of the linker region, has been supported by mutation-function analysis of the linker peptide segment (16Izrailev S.

Given the homologies: (a) between the cytochromeb 6/subunit IV polypeptides and mitochondrial cytochrome b measured at low resolution (20Bron P. Lacapere J.J. Breyton C. Mosser G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), (b) the hydropathy and histidine ligation identities predicted from the respective gene sequences (21Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrmann R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), (c) the cluster-binding domains of the Rieske ISP (22Carrell C.J. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and (d) in addition the flexible nature of the polyglycine putative linker region in the ISP of the b 6 f complex (22Carrell C.J. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), it is inferred that the ISP in the b 6 f complex also carries out its electron transfer function by a large-scale rotation-translation between donor-acceptor sites. This inference is supported by orientation changes of the principal g values of the [2Fe-2S] system in the isolated b 6 fcomplex induced by the p-side quinone analogue inhibitor, 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropylbenzoquinone (23Schoepp B. Brugna M. Riedel A. Nitschke W. Kramer D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or metal ions (24Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the systematic effect of increased ambient viscosity on the rate of reduction of cytochromes f andb 6 in thylakoid membranes (25Heimann S. Ponamarev M.V. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2692-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The 3–5-ms half-time for the reduction of cytochrome f by the Rieske ISP is the rate-limiting step of theb 6 f complex, and of oxygenic photosynthesis. The events included in the observable reduction of cytochrome f include: (i) electron transfer from plastoquinol to the ISP; (ii) release of the ISP from the quinol-proximal binding site; (iii) tethered movement of the ISP from its quinol-proximal site to a site close to the cytochrome fheme, as described above; (iv) electron transfer from the docked ISP to cytochrome f. Stopped-flow and equilibrium measurements were employed to follow the kinetics and pH dependence in vitro of the docking and electron transfer reaction of soluble redox-active fragments, 142 and 252 residues, respectively, of the Rieske ISP and cytochromef. These data show that electron transfer in solution between these partners cannot rely on electrostatically guided docking, as occurs with plastocyanin/cytochrome f; the second-order rate constant obtained in vitro predicts a first-order rate constant in vivo that is substantially smaller than the observed values. Plasmid pOSH37d was constructed to produce the 142-residue Chlamydomonas reinhardtiichloroplast Rieske iron-sulfur fragment, CRN37d (142 residues, deletion of 37 N-terminal residues). A segment of the PetC gene was amplified from Chlamydomonas RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR and inserted into plasmid pET32a (Novagen, Madison, WI). This plasmid (pOSH37d or pTRXCRN37d) carries a fused open reading frame for thioredoxin, a 6-histidine tag for affinity purification, two thrombin cleavage sites, and the Rieske CRN37d ISP under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Procedures for Chlamydomonas ISP were based on those developed previously for cyanobacterial ISP. 2Y. S. Cho and T. Kallas, unpublished data. Escherichia coli AD494(DE3) (Novagen) carrying pOSH37d was grown to early exponential phase (40–60 Klett units, Klett-Summerson colorimeter) in LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin, 1 mmFeSO4, and 2 mm cysteine typically at 25 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm and incubation was continued overnight. Harvested cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.2. Urea was added to 8 m and the cells were broken by three passages through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. and 4 °C. The ISP fusion protein in the crude supernatant fraction was reconstituted with iron-sulfur clusters as described in Refs. 26Holton B., Wu, X. Tsapin A.L. Kramer D.M. Malkin R. Kallas T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15485-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 27Cheng H. Westler W.M. Xia B., Oh, B.-H. Markley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar but with the detergents and dialysis steps omitted. Fusion protein was purified directly from the reconstitution mixture (after dilution of urea to 0.8m) by fast protein liquid chromatography (AmershamBiosciences) and either His-Bind (Novagen) or DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) resins. The latter, which sometimes gave cleaner separation, was used for the current work. The crude, reconstituted fusion protein preparation was loaded onto the column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, buffer and eluted with a 0–1.0m gradient of NaCl in the same buffer. The fusion protein, which eluted at about 300 mm NaCl, was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM10 membrane) to several milligrams/ml and cleaved overnight with thrombin (0.2 units/mg of protein) at room temperature. Cleavage yielded a 13.9-kDa His-tagged thioredoxin fragment, a 3.9-kDa linker fragment, and the 14.9-kDa CRN37d ISP. The ISP was purified by passage over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind Superflow resin (Novagen) followed by diafiltration (YM-10 membrane) to a concentration of about 1.7 mg/ml (107 μm). The protein concentration of the ISP was estimated by its absorbance at 280 nm and predicted extinction coefficient of 3.17 × 104m−1 cm−1 (28Gross R. Pytte A. Green D. Doyle J. Gene Inspector, Sequence Analysis Computer Program, Version 1.5. Textco, W. Lebanon, NH1999Google Scholar). EPR spectra were obtained on a Varian E-4 X-band spectrometer as described previously (26Holton B., Wu, X. Tsapin A.L. Kramer D.M. Malkin R. Kallas T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15485-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) at ∼15 K, 5 mW microwave power, 10 G modulation amplitude, 0.128-s time constant, and 100 KHz modulation frequency. ISP samples were found to be nearly fully reduced as prepared because the addition of ascorbate produced minimal increases in signal amplitude. The spin concentration of ISP [2Fe-2S] clusters was estimated by double integration of the EPR signal and comparison against a copper-perchlorate standard (29Aasa R. Albracht P.J. Falk K.E. Lanne B. Vanngard T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A 252-residue redox-active fragment of wild type cytochromef was overproduced in E. coli as described in Ref. 7Ponamarev M.V. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17199-17208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. The cytochrome f construct was co-transformed with pEC86 that carries the cassette of cytochrome c maturation genes (30Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into strain MV1190. The cells were grown semianaerobically at 37 °C for 20–24 h. The cells were harvested and broken by osmotic shock with 20% sucrose in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Crude cytochrome f in the supernatant was passed through a DE-52 ion-exchange column. Fractions containing cytochrome fwere then pooled, concentrated, and passed through a Sephadex G-100 size exclusion column. Cytochrome f fractions withA 554/A 280 > 0.7 were then passed through a hydroxyapatite column; fractions withA 554/A 280 ≥ 0.9 were collected. Plastocyanin was isolated and purified from wild-typeC. reinhardtii cells through ammonium sulfate precipitation as described in Ref. 6Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Piskorowski R.A. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15120-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar. The rate of reduction of oxidized soluble cytochrome f by the soluble ISP fragment from C. reinhardtii was determined by following changes in the cytochrome absorbance at 421 nm in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics SX.18MV) at room temperature. Cytochromef was oxidized by potassium ferricyanide and the excess oxidant was removed by filtration through a Centricon 10 filtration unit. Second-order rate constants were obtained from a set of pseudo-first order rate measurements, in which this rate was measured as a function of the concentration of cytochrome f, 10-, 15-, and 20-fold greater than that of the ISP. Conditions for which the concentration of ISP was in excess of that of cytochrome fyielded the same results. The reaction of oxidized cytochromef and ISP under equilibrium conditions was carried out by mixing the two proteins and then scanning the spectrum of cytochromef from 400 to 580 nm in a Cary 3 (Varian) spectrophotometer. Equimolar concentrations (0.5 μm) of oxidized cytochrome f and reduced ISP were mixed and the spectrum of cytochrome f was scanned from 400 to 580 nm. The reaction was performed initially at pH 4.1; the pH was then increased incrementally (in steps of 0.5 pH units) to pH > 8.0 by adding microliter amounts of 5–10 m NaOH. The spectrum of cytochrome f at each pH was recorded in a Cary 3 spectrophotometer. The amount of cytochrome f reduced was calculated from the amplitude of the α (554 nm) difference band at each pH using an extinction coefficient of 2.6 × 104m−1 cm−1 (31Metzger S.U. Cramer W.A. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The soluble fragment of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast Rieske protein was expressed in E. coli as a chimeric thioredoxin/Rieske ISP fusion protein and reconstituted in vitro with iron and sulfide to regenerate the 2Fe-2S cluster. SDS-PAGE of the purified fusion protein is shown (Fig.1 A). Thrombin cleavage, passage over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, and ultrafiltration generated the 14.9-kDa Rieske ISP (Fig. 1 B). Restoration of typical Rieske 2Fe-2S clusters to the expressed ISP is demonstrated by the low temperature EPR spectrum (gx = 1.75, gy = 1.90, gz = 2.03), characteristic of the high potential Rieske [2Fe-2S] protein (Fig. 1 C). The 142-residue ISP (CRN37d) carries two residues (Gly and Ser) of the thrombin cleavage site in front of the flexible hinge region starting at residue Phe-38. Based on the estimation of protein concentration and spin quantification of the EPR signal, the cluster content of the reconstituted ISP was ∼65%. The ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized chemical difference spectrum for the ISP has broad positive and negative peaks at 400 and 476 nm (data not shown) with relatively weak extinction coefficients. This implies that: (a) the more narrow absorbance bands of cytochromef, with much higher extinction coefficients, would be more useful for optical assay of electron transfer between the pair; and (b) the interference from ISP absorbance would be negligible (∼0.4% in the presence of equimolar amounts of the two proteins) in the assay of cytochrome f reduction measured using the Soret band of the latter (Fig. 2).Figure 2Reduction of cytochrome f by the Rieske ISP in vitro. The bold trace is a spectrum of oxidized cytochrome f alone. Thethin solid and dashed traces are spectra of cytochrome f after reaction with the Rieske ISP at pH 8.5 and 4.1, respectively. Reaction mixtures contained 0.5 μmreduced Rieske ISP, 0.5 μm oxidized cytochromef, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm each of succinate, MES, HEPES, TRICINE, and CHES buffers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The soluble ISP was able to transfer an electron to oxidized cytochrome f, as shown by the decrease in absorbance of cytochrome f at 410 nm and the increase in its absorbance at 421 nm (Fig. 2). The spectrum of oxidized cytochrome f is defined by a sharp Soret peak at 410 nm whereas its α band around 554 nm is featureless. The increase in amplitude of the Soret peak at 421 nm associated with its reduction by the ISP is accompanied by the appearance of a distinct α-band at 554 nm. Redox reactions of cytochrome f were observed by following changes in the Soret band at 410 or 421 nm, rather than the α-band whose extinction coefficient is ∼⅛ that of the Soret band. Stopped-flow measurements of the reaction between reduced Rieske ISP and oxidized cytochrome f yielded a second-order rate constant, k 2(ISP­f) ≈ 1.5 × 106m−1s−1. Typical traces of the kinetics of cytochromef reduction at pH 5.6 and 7.5 are shown in Fig 3 A and summarized in Table I. Under the same reaction conditions, the rate of electron transfer from cytochromef to PC is more rapid, withk 2(f­PC) ∼ 200 × 106 and 50 × 106m−1 s−1, respectively, at pH 7, and 0.01 and 0.2 m ionic strength (6Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Piskorowski R.A. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15120-15128Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Qin L. Kostic N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5145-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). No variation in the k 2(ISP­f) was observed between ionic strengths of 0.01 and 0.10 m, nor between pH 7.5 and 5.6. Although there was no observable pH dependence fork 2(ISP­f), the amplitude of cytochrome f reduction was larger at pH 7.5 than at 5.6 (Fig. 3 A). The kinetics of cytochrome f reduction by ISP was also measured as a function of wavelength to generate a “stopped-flow spectrum” of the reaction (Fig. 3 B). The stopped-flow spectrum peaks at 421 nm, and is virtually identical to the Soret band of the reduced minus oxidized chemical difference spectrum, indicating that the kinetics observed in the stopped-flow experiment were specifically those associated with cytochrome f reduction.Table IRate constants for oxidation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and oxidation-reduction of cytochrome (cyt) fIn vivo,aRate constants obtained for cytochrome f oxidation-reduction in chloroplasts or cells ofC. reinhardtii (4, 5, 7). k 1(s−1)In vitro,bRate constants obtained from stopped-flow data in the present study.k 2 ((m−1 s−1) × 10−6)In vitro,cRate constants were obtained from measurements in isolated cytochrome bc 1 complexes; 2/3 and 1/3 of the amplitude of the cytochrome c 1reduction is associated with the large and small rate constants (11).k 1 (s−1)ISP → Cyt fCytf → PCI(M)dI(M), ionic strength.ISPbRate constants obtained from stopped-flow data in the present study.→ Cyt fCyt f → PCISP → Cytc 1150–250∼2,400–3,000eRate constant determined fromin vitro reaction of cytochrome f and PC initiated by flash photolysis of flavin-semiquinone (32,47).0.01∼1.5>20016,000 (2/3),cRate constants were obtained from measurements in isolated cytochrome bc 1 complexes; 2/3 and 1/3 of the amplitude of the cytochrome c 1reduction is associated with the large and small rate constants (11). 250 (1/3)0.20∼1.550a Rate constants obtained for cytochrome f oxidation-reduction in chloroplasts or cells ofC. reinhardtii (4Delosme R.

A larger pH dependence of the E m, ΔE m(pH) = −60 mV/pH was obtained for the ISP [2Fe-2S] cluster in isolated cytochromeb 6 f complexes from spinach (35Nitschke W. Joliot P. Liebl U. Rutherford A.W. Hauska G. Miller A. Riedel A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 266-268Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In either case, ΔE m increases, and the amount of cytochrome f reduced by ISP in the reaction, ISP(red) + cytochrome f(ox) → ISP(ox) + cytochrome f(red), increases with increasing pH (Figs. 2 and4 A). A plot of the amplitude of cytochrome f reduced by an equimolar quantity of ISP (Fig. 4 A) reflects the pH dependence of theE m of the ISP (34Zhang H. Carrell C.J. Huang D. Sled V. Ohnishi T.

The pH dependence of the extent of cytochrome f reduction by the ISP at each pH was identical when measured in the α- and Soret bands of cytochromef. Cytochrome f is ∼50 and ∼95% reduced at pH 4.1 and 8.5, respectively, as seen by the amplitude of the α- and Soret band peaks (Figs. 2 and 4 A). The pK ox for the reaction is ∼6.2, which is close to the value previously measured by titration of the visible spectrum of the 139-residue ISP isolated from the spinachb 6 f complex (34Zhang H.

Joliot P. Liebl U. Rutherford A.W. Hauska G. Miller A. Riedel A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 266-268Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The midpoint potential of the ISP at each pH point in Fig. 4 Bcould be determined from the known amount of oxidized and reduced cytochrome f, and from the known midpoint potential of cytochrome f (E m = +370 mV), which is pH-independent from pH 4 to 8. A plot of E m versus pH for the ISP is shown (Fig. 4 B). pK values of 6.2 and 8.2 for the oxidized and reduced forms, respectively, of the ISP were obtained by least squares fit to the formula, E m = E m,low pH − 59 log((K ox + H+)/(K red + H+)), whereK ox and K red are acid dissociation equilibrium constants for the oxidized and reduced species, respectively. Although two pK values of 7.6 and 9.2 were inferred for the oxidized form of the ISP from bovine heart mitochondria (36Link T.A. Hagen W.R. Pierik A.J. Assmann C. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the fit to the present data does not require a fit to two pK values. The slope of the curve in the pH-dependent region from pH 6 to 8.5 is −40 mV/pH, in agreement with the approximately −30 mV/pH obtained from optical titration in the visible spectrum (34Zhang H.

https://openalex.org/W2011229139,"In fly photoreceptor cells, light initiates a G protein-coupled phospholipase Cb-dependent signaling cascade that results in the depolarization of the cell membrane, which is mediated by the cation channels TRP and TRPL. Together with phospholipase Cb and an eye-specific protein kinase C, TRP is tethered to the scaffolding protein INAD, which forms a multimolecular signaling complex. Divergent data from expressed TRP and studies from photoreceptor cells have brought up a controversy whether or not a capacitative calcium entry (CCE) mechanism is involved in the Drosophila phototransduction pathway. Our initial characterization of TRP from photoreceptors of Calliphora vicina supported the hypothesis of a CCE mechanism, as heterologously expressed TRP was stimulated after application of thapsigargin. The situation changed when the PDZ domain protein INAD was coexpressed with TRP. In cells coexpressing TRP and INAD, no calcium entry was detectable on application of store depletion protocols. Suppression of CCE by INAD was not observed when the described interaction was disrupted by mutations in TRP and INAD. Our data show that apparent activation of TRP by CCE is abolished by INAD. Within the complex, the proteins necessary for phototransduction mutually influence their activities. The results support the hypothesis of a store-independent activation of TRP."
