https://openalex.org/W1972745320,"In the wild-type C. elegans germ line there are both mitotic and meiotic germ cells. Mutations in glp-1 cause germ cells that would normally divide mitotically to enter meiosis. This mutant phenotype mimics the effect of killing the distal tip cell, a somatic cell that interacts with the germ line to regulate the mitotic/meiotic decision. In addition, wild-type glp-1 product is required maternally for embryogenesis. Temperature-shift experiments indicate that the temporal requirement for glp-1 activity in the germ line is the same as that for distal tip cell regulation. Mosaic analyses suggest that glp-1 is produced in the germ line. We propose that glp-1 acts as part of the receiving mechanism in the interaction between the distal tip cell and germ line."
https://openalex.org/W2068942949,"An octamer-binding transcription factor, OTF-1, which stimulates transcription of a human histone H2b gene, has been purified from HeLa nuclear extracts. This purification was achieved through the use of DNA affinity chromatography, and the factor was unambiguously identified by renaturation of activity following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified factor retained the ability to efficiently stimulate H2b transcription in a reconstituted in vitro system. This effect was dependent upon an intact octamer element and was observed in the absence of the other H2b promoter elements (except the TATA motif). Furthermore, this activity was not detected in nuclear extracts prepared from cells synchronized in G2, in agreement with the in vivo data showing S-phase-specific utilization of the octamer element. From these data, we conclude that we have purified the bona fide H2b transcriptional regulatory factor."
https://openalex.org/W1999939543,"A plasmid containing the major late promoter was assembled into nucleosomes in a Xenopus oocyte extract, isolated by gel filtration, and found to be refractory to transcription initiation in vitro. However, exposure of the promoter to HeLa nuclear extract or to a mixture of isolated transcription factors prior to nucleosome assembly prevented nucleosome-mediated repression of the promoter. Inactivation or elimination of the TATA box-binding factor (TFIID) abolished the ability of these treatments to preserve promoter function. Preincubation with TFIID alone prevented repression and resulted in TFIID being sequestered into the nucleosome-assembled templates. Preincubation with all the transcription factors resulted in the assembly of nucleosome templates containing a near complete preinitiation complex, which required only the addition of TFIIE for transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2129900247,"Interactions between the early blastomeres in a C. elegans embryo are required for the specification of certain cell fates. Blastomeres that produce neurons and skin cells when cultured in isolation are induced to also produce pharyngeal cells in intact embryos. We have identified maternal effect lethal mutations that, on the basis of phenotype and temperature-sensitive period, appear to disrupt this inductive interaction. These mutations are all alleles of glp-1, a gene also involved in the control of germ cell proliferation during postembryonic development of C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1962926056,"A study was done to examine the effects of aluminum, magnesium, and boron on major mineral metabolism in postmenopausal women. This communication describes some of the effects of dietary boron on 12 women between the ages of 48 and 82 housed in a metabolic unit. A boron supplement of 3 mg/day markedly affected several indices of mineral metabolism of seven women consuming a low-magnesium diet and five women consuming a diet adequate in magnesium; the women had consumed a conventional diet supplying about 0.25 mg boron/day for 119 days. Boron supplementation markedly reduced the urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium; the depression seemed more marked when dietary magnesium was low. Boron supplementation depressed the urinary excretion of phosphorus by the low-magnesium, but not by the adequate-magnesium, women. Boron supplementation markedly elevated the serum concentrations of 17β-estradiol and testosterone; the elevation seemed more marked when dietary magnesium was low. Neither high dietary aluminum (1000 mg/day) nor an interaction between boron and aluminum affected the variables presented. The findings suggest that supplementation of a low-boron diet with an amount of boron commonly found in diets high in fruits and vegetables induces changes in postmenopausal women consistent with the prevention of calcium loss and bone demineralization.— Nielsen, F. H.; Hunt, C. D.; Mullen, L. M.; Hunt, J. R. Effect of dietary boron on mineral, estrogen, and testosterone metabolism in postmenopausal women. FASEB J. 1: 394-397; 1987."
https://openalex.org/W1604648602,"Ryanodine, a highly toxic alkaloid, reacts specifically with the Ca2+ release channels which are localized in the terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In this study, the ryanodine receptor from cardiac SR has been purified, characterized, and compared with that of skeletal muscle SR. The ryanodine receptor was solubilized with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) in the presence of phospholipids. Purification was performed by sequential affinity chromatography followed by gel permeation chromatography in the presence of CHAPS and phospholipids. The enrichment of the receptor from cardiac microsomes was about 110-fold. The purified receptor contained a major polypeptide band of Mr 340,000 with a minor band of Mr 300,000 (absorbance ratio 100/8) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electron microscopy of the purified receptor from heart showed square structures of 222 +/- 21 A/side, which is the unique characteristic of feet structures of junctional face membrane of terminal cisternae of SR. Recently, we isolated the ryanodine receptor from skeletal muscle (Inui, M., Saito, A., and Fleischer, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1740-1747). The ryanodine receptors from heart and skeletal muscle have similar characteristics in terms of protein composition, morphology, chromatographic behavior, and Ca2+, salt, and phospholipid dependence of ryanodine binding. However, there are distinct differences: 1) the Mr of the receptor is slightly larger for skeletal muscle (Mr approximately 360,000); 2) the purified receptor from heart contains two different affinities for ryanodine binding with Kd values in the nanomolar and micromolar ranges, contrasting with that of skeletal muscle SR which shows only the high affinity binding; 3) the affinity of the purified cardiac receptor for ryanodine was 4-5-fold higher than that of skeletal muscle, measured under identical conditions. The greater sensitivity in ryanodine in intact heart can be directly explained by the tighter binding of the ryanodine receptor from heart. The present study suggests that basically similar machinery (the ryanodine receptor and foot structure) is involved in triggering Ca2+ release from cardiac and skeletal muscle SR, albeit there are distinct differences in the sensitivity to ryanodine and other ligands in heart versus skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1557531431,"We describe the biochemical characterization and purification of the small 28,000-dalton heat shock protein (28-kDa protein) of mammalian cells. Metabolic pulse labeling of heat shock-treated cells with either [3H]leucine or H3 32PO4 and analysis of the labeled proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed increased levels of three 28-kDa proteins differing only in their relative isoelectric point. Using both peptide mapping and immunological analysis, we demonstrate that all three proteins are related isoforms, with two of the isoforms containing phosphate. Cell fractionation studies revealed that the 28-kDa protein localizes predominantly within the nuclear pellet very shortly after the heat shock treatment. With increasing times of recovery of the heat-treated cells back at 37 degrees C, the majority of the 28-kDa protein was now observed to fractionate within the soluble fraction of the cells. Both gel filtration and velocity sedimentation studies revealed that the 28-kDA protein exists as a higher order structure with an approximate S20,w value of 10-18 S, a Stokes radius of about 60-70 A, and an estimated native molecular mass of at least 500,000 daltons. We describe a relatively simple and rapid purification of the proteins employing both ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W2039046420,"In 113 community food webs from natural communities, the average and maximal lengths of food chains are independent of primary productivity, contrary to the hypothesis that longer food chains should arise when more energy is available at their base. Environmental variability alone also does not appear to constrain average or maximal chain length. Environments that are three dimensional or solid, however, such as a forest canopy or the water column of the open ocean, have distinctly longer food chains than environments that are two dimensional or flat, such as a grassland or lake bottom."
https://openalex.org/W2038358949,"The ability of gap junction antibodies to block dye transfer and electrical coupling was examined in the compacted 8-cell mouse zygote. In control zygotes, Lucifer yellow injected into 1 cell transferred to the rest of the embryo. When antibodies raised against the major protein extracted from gap junctions were co-injected with Lucifer yellow, dye transfer failed in 86% of the zygotes tested and electrical coupling was almost completely inhibited. Subsequently, the antibody-containing cells were extruded. When the antibodies were injected into 1 cell at the 2-cell stage, 82% of the zygotes divided normally to the 8-cell stage. Cells containing gap junction antibodies were uncompacted, but continued to divide. We conclude that these antibodies inhibit gap junctional communication in the early mouse zygote and that communication through gap junctions may be involved in the maintenance of compaction."
https://openalex.org/W1485969138,"Human fibroblast cell cultures were employed as a model system to rapidly examine several potentially important variables involved in the use of high-voltage, pulsed galvanic stimulation (HVPGS) to increase the healing rate of soft tissue injuries. Fibroblasts were grown on Millipore filters and exposed to HVPGS of various voltages and pulse rates for 20 min in a rectangular, plastic chamber filled with growth medium. Filters with attached cells were placed either in the center of the chamber or close to the positive or negative electrode. Protein synthesis and DNA synthesis were monitored after stimulation using the radioactively labeled precursors, [3H]proline and [3H]thymidine, respectively. The major results obtained in this study are as follows: 1) the rates of both protein and DNA synthesis can be significantly increased by specific combinations of HVPGS voltage and pulse rate; 2) maximum stimulation of protein and DNA synthesis was obtained at 50 and 75 V, respectively, with a pulse rate of 100 pulses/s and the cells located near the negative electrode; and 3) exposure to HVPGS intensities greater than 250 V (at all pulse rates and locations within the chamber) is inhibitory for both protein and DNA synthesis. In view of the results obtained in preliminary clinical studies on the use of HVPGS for the treatment of dermal ulcers, it appears that similar voltages, pulse rates, and relative electrode location may be required for maximum acceleration of human skin wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1520762000,"We have developed a model of isochemic bowel necrosis in the rat by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) or PAF in combination with bacterial endotoxin. PAF causes profound hypotension, and it has been suggested that it is released during endotoxin shock. Because ischemic bowel necrosis is often associated with shock or infection, it is possible that PAF is the endogenous mediator that causes shock and bowel necrosis during sepsis. In this study, we have demonstrated that: 1) normal intestine contained a small amount of PAF; 2) necrotic lesions of the intestine could be induced by endotoxin injection; 3) PAF production in the bowel is markedly increased in animals treated with endotoxin; 4) pretreatment of the animal with PAF antagonists prevent endotoxin-induced necrosis; 5) isolated, buffer-perfused small intestine produced a small quantity of PAF in response to endotoxin injection. Therefore, we conclude that PAF is a likely endogenous mediator in endotoxemia, which causes bowel necrosis and shock.—Hsueh, W.; González-Crussi, F.; Arroyave, J. L. Platelet-activating factor: an endogenous mediator for bowel necrosis in endotoxemia. FASEB J. 1: 403-405; 1987."
https://openalex.org/W2020909792,"We have identified neurofascin, a novel chick cell-surface glycoprotein involved in neurite-neurite interactions. Neurofascin is defined by its reactivity with monoclonal antibody (MAb) F6, which detects two polypeptides (160 and 185 kd) in immunotransfers of brain plasma membrane proteins. Immunoaffinity chromatography using immobilized MAb F6 yields major molecular mass bands at 185, 160, 135-110, and 92 kd. Fingerprint analyses show that these polypeptides are related. Neurofascin is expressed primarily in fiber-rich areas of embryonic cerebellum, spinal cord, and retina. Fab fragments of polyclonal antibodies to neurofascin interfere with the outgrowth of retinal and sympathetic axons in two different in vitro bioassays. Neurofascin is immunologically distinct from other known neurite-associated surface glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1516288804,"Adenosine, via interaction with A1 adenosine receptors, increases insulin sensitivity and inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes. To investigate regulation of this system, adipocytes were incubated for up to 72 h with the nonmetabolizable adenosine receptor agonist, N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine (PIA). Adenosine receptors were measured by the binding of 125I-hydroxyphenylisopropyl adenosine to membranes. PIA down-regulated adenosine receptors, decreasing the number of binding sites with no change in affinity. Adipocytes were incubated for 48 h without or with 100 nM PIA to down-regulate the A1 receptors by approximately 60%. The cells were washed, and lipolysis and glucose transport were assessed. The ability of PIA to inhibit lipolysis was markedly attenuated in the down-regulated cells. Furthermore, the EC50 of insulin was increased approximately 3-fold in the PIA-treated cells. 125I-Insulin binding to the PIA-treated cells was unchanged, demonstrating that the decreased insulin sensitivity is not due to decreased insulin receptor binding. Pertussis toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a 41-kDa protein thought to be the alpha-subunit of Gi. This 41-kDa protein was decreased in membranes from cells treated with PIA, with a maximal 50% loss. This suggests that Gi is down-regulated and that loss of both the A1 adenosine receptor and Gi are involved in the metabolic changes observed after PIA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2412176019,"Evidence is presented that rat liver plasma membranes contain a distinct NADH diferric transferrin reductase. Three different assay procedures for demonstration of the activity are described. The enzyme activity is highest in isolated plasma membrane, and activity in other internal membranes is one-eighth or less than in plasma membrane. The activity is inhibited by apotransferrin and antitransferrin antibodies. Trypsin treatment of the membranes leads to rapid loss of the transferrin reductase activity as compared with NADH ferricyanide reductase activity. Erythrocyte plasma membranes, which lack transferrin receptors, show no diferric transferrin reductase activity, although NADH ferricyanide reductase is present. The transferrin reductase is inhibited by agents that inhibit diferric transferrin reduction by intact cells and is activated by CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfate) detergent. Inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport have no effect on the activity. We propose that the NADH diferric transferrin reductase in plasma membranes measures the activity of the enzyme that causes the reduction of diferric transferrin by intact cells. This transmembrane electron transport system requires the transferrin receptor for diferric transferrin reduction. Because the transmembrane electron transport has been shown to stimulate cell growth, the reduction of diferric transferrin at the cell surface may be an important function for diferric transferrin in stimulation of cell growth, in addition to its role in iron transport."
https://openalex.org/W1552590528,"In order to examine the influence of protein structure on the post-translational import of a protein into mitochondria, the carboxyl-terminal 129 residues of F1-ATPase beta-subunit precursor (511aa) have been replaced with 61 residues of yeast copper metallothionein. Import of the F1 beta-copper metallothionein (beta CuMT) hybrid into mitochondria was as efficient as that of the F1 beta precursor in the absence of copper. Addition of copper to mitochondrial import reactions, which had no significant effect on import of the F1 beta-subunit precursor, blocked import of the beta CuMT protein. This copper-dependent transport block for the beta CuMT precursor occurred after the precursor was bound to mitochondria. Expression of the beta CuMT protein in vivo revealed that beta CuMT would bind copper and allow growth of a copper-sensitive yeast host on an otherwise inhibitory level of the cation as long as it was localized in the cytoplasm. These data indicate that the binding of copper by beta CuMT renders it refractile for partial unfolding which is necessary for its translocation into mitochondria. These observations provide an alternative scheme for the selection of mutants defective in mitochondrial import."
https://openalex.org/W67897377,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), the biologically active form of vitamin D3, has been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote monocytic differentiation of leukemic cell lines. In the present communication, we extend these observations to normal bone marrow macrophage precursors, and 1) identify the stage of monocytic maturation wherein the steroid exerts its antiproliferative effect, and 2) demonstrate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotes bone marrow macrophage differentiation as manifest by specific up-regulation of the lineage-specific membrane protein, the mannose-fucose receptor. In these experiments, the 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated inhibitory effect on colony formation was shown to be independent of attendant levels of colony stimulating factor-1 and targeted through the adherent bone marrow macrophage precursor. Examination of this steroid-sensitive adherent precursor population demonstrates that its specific binding of 125I-mannose bovine serum albumin spontaneously and progressively increases with time in culture. Whereas adherent bone marrow macrophages cultured for 2 days express 3 X 10(4) mannose receptors/cell, the number of binding sites increases to 7 X 10(4)/cell by day 4. When bone marrow macrophage precursors are exposed to 1,25-(OH)2D3, an additional stepwise enhancement of 125I-mannose bovine serum albumin obtains with time. Four days of culture with the steroid results in 1.6 X 10(5) mannose receptors/cell, a 100% increase as compared to control cells. Neither duration of culture nor exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3 alters the KD of 125I-mannose bovine serum albumin which approximates 3-5 X 10(-9) ml-1. Finally, the specificity of vitamin D-mediated up-regulation of the mannose receptor was established by demonstrating that the steroid does not alter binding of 125I-alpha-thrombin by bone marrow-derived macrophage precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1518778582,"The total Ca2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum and the total Ca2+ and Mg2+ content of mitochondria were determined by electron probe microanalysis of rat liver rapidly frozen in vivo following brief (5-15 s) stimulation with vasopressin or prolonged (10-12 min) stimulation with vasopressin + glucagon. Brief vasopressin injection into the anterior mesenteric vein released 1.8 +/- 0.3 (S.D.) mmol of Ca2+/kg dry weight, from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (p less than 0.01), reducing Ca2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum from 4.4 +/- 0.2 (S.E.) (controls) to 2.6 +/- 0.2 mmol of Ca2+/kg dry weight. Following vasopressin injection, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ was also significantly (p less than 0.025) lower than that in brief sham injected animals (3.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/kg dry weight). Mitochondrial Ca2+ was between 1.0 and 2.3 (+/-0.2) mmol/kg dry weight of mitochondrion, under all conditions studied, and no significant differences were observed. Both hormonal and brief sham injection into the anterior mesenteric vein increased mitochondrial Mg2+ from 42 (+/-0.8) to 49 (+/-1.8) mmol/kg dry weight (p less than 0.05). Hormonal stimulation of Mg2+ uptake was further confirmed by injection of vasopressin + glucagon into the jugular vein (to avoid any stimulation of the liver by the anterior mesenteric vein injection itself); mitochondrial Mg2+ increased from 43 (+/-0.9) (10-min sham) to 57 (+/-1.3) mmol/kg dry weight, with 10-min vasopressin + glucagon injection (p less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that hormones can release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and modulate mitochondrial Mg2+ content in vivo without causing detectable changes in mitochondrial Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1584008028,"Filaggrin is an important keratin intermediate filament-associated protein of terminally differentiated mammalian epidermis. Its aberrant expression has been implicated in a number of keratinizing disorders. We have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone to mouse filaggrin, of 1.479 kilobase pairs, which represents less than 10% of the full-length mRNA estimated by Northern blot analysis to be 17 kilobases long. The cDNA clone delineates a 744-base pair repeat. This encodes a protein of 248 amino acids or 26,330 Da, which is almost identical to the known properties of mouse filaggrin in size, amino acid composition, and charge. Total mouse genomic DNA and the filaggrin gene isolated from a cosmid library were found to contain a super-stoichiometric repeat of the same size. These data support the hypothesis (Haydock, P.V., and Dale, B.A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12520-12525) that filaggrin is initially synthesized as a polyprotein precursor containing many tandem copies. However, our data suggest that the repeating filaggrin units of the precursor are not separated by large linker peptides as suggested by these authors. In situ hybridization was used to show that the filaggrin precursor mRNA is located precisely over the granular layer of the epidermis, indicating that expression of this gene is regulated at the transcriptional level as for the differentiation-specific keratin 1 protein. These probes will now permit detailed studies on the regulation of expression of the filaggrin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1587561974,"A partial cDNA clone for the Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) locus was used to investigate the expression of this locus in human muscle in vitro. Hybridization to a 14-kilobase RNA transcript was demonstrated in both fetal and mature human skeletal muscle and four lines of human muscle cells in culture. The DMD transcript was not detected in cultured cells outside the muscle lineage. In cultured muscle cells, gene expression was evident only in myotubes both before and after innervation with mouse spinal cord. Primary cultures of human myoblasts did not show the presence of the DMD transcript prior to fusion to form myotubes. An in vitro model is potentially an excellent system in which to investigate factors controlling expression of the DMD gene in normal muscle and how this expression is altered in cultured DMD muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2049876272,"In extracts derived from activated eggs of Xenopus, oocyte 5S RNA gene transcription complexes are destabilized under conditions where somatic 5S RNA gene transcription complexes are stable. Trans-acting factors in destabilized complexes are in equilibrium with free factors in the extract, and thus transcription becomes dependent upon the concentration of the limiting factor in the extract. By reducing TFIIIA, a limiting factor in the egg extract, a cloned somatic 5S RNA gene is transcribed as much as 400-fold more efficiently than a cloned oocyte 5S RNA gene."
https://openalex.org/W2411345592,"The urokinase-catalyzed activation of human Glu1-plasminogen (Glu1Pg) has been found to be inhibited by monovalent anions in the following order of effectiveness: I- greater than SCN- greater than Cl- greater than IO3- greater than HCOO- greater than F- greater than OAc-. The inhibition is reversed by epsilon-aminocaproic acid, with its effectiveness in this capacity generally inversely proportional to the strength of the binding of the anion. The physical basis for the anion inhibition and epsilon-aminocaproic acid stimulation lies in the ability of these effectors to cause measurable opposite alterations in the conformation of Glu1Pg, which are revealed through study of the sedimentation velocity of the protein under various conditions. The kinetic mechanism of the chloride inhibition of Glu1Pg activation has been examined in detail. It has been found that the Glu1Pg.Cl complex serves as an alternate substrate to Glu1Pg for urokinase, with a greatly increased Km (25 +/- 3 and 2.2 +/- 0.3 microM, respectively) for activation. The kcat for the urokinase.Glu1Pg.Cl complex is approximately the same as that for urokinase.Glu1Pg (1.6 +/- 0.2 - 2.0 +/- 0.2/s). Similarly, the stimulation by epsilon-aminocaproic acid also results from effects on the Km of the activation, which is reduced to 1.8 +/- 0.2 microM for the Glu1Pg.Cl.epsilon-aminocaproic acid complex. The kcat for the urokinase.Glu1Pg.Cl.epsilon-aminocaproic acid of 2.4 +/- 0.3/s complex is not greatly different from that for urokinase.Glu1Pg.Cl. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the Glu1Pg-induced line broadening of the 35Cl- spectra in the presence and absence of epsilon-aminocaproic acid suggest that Cl- and epsilon-aminocaproic acid simultaneously bind to the protein and that each of these effectors displays its effects through separate binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2114186612,"Raman spectra have been measured for intact rat lens nuclei at various stages of aging in an attempt to gain further insight into age-related structural changes in the lens proteins, especially changes concerning protein sulfhydryl groups. Two Raman bands at 2579 and 2561 cm-1 were observed to be assignable to SH stretching modes of the cysteine residues. These bands have been attributed to and sulfhydryl groups of the lens proteins, respectively, on the basis of a model compound study. The relative intensities of both SH stretching modes decreased with lens aging, and concurrently the intensity of a S-S stretching mode at 509 cm-1 due to disulfide bridges increased, suggesting that not only exposed but also buried protein sulfhydryl groups are converted to disulfide groups as a result of aging. The rate of the intensity decrease in the 2561 cm-1 band was similar to that in the 2579 cm-1 band. Therefore, it seems likely that the sulfhydryl groups in the two distinct environments are nearly equally subjected to the oxidation. Cysteine and cystine residues of the lens proteins gave their C-S stretching modes at 708 cm-1, indicating that they predominantly assume PC and/or PN conformers. The intensity ratio of a tyrosine doublet near 840 cm-1 (I832/I855) changed from approximately 0.86 to approximately 0.81 with the aging of the rat lens. This result implies that some tyrosine residues undergo a change in their hydrogen bonding environments during the course of aging. Of particular importance is that the relative intensity change of the tyrosine doublet with normal aging and that with cataract formation are in opposite directions."

https://openalex.org/W1586124318,"An improved freeze-fracture electron microscope procedure has been developed and applied to the study of the association of bacteriorhodopsin in large proteoliposomes reconstituted by reverse-phase evaporation with egg lecithin. Due to the improved accuracy and resolution of this procedure, intramembrane particles, the diameter of which (4.5 nm) closely matched that of bacteriorhodopsin monomer, could be observed at high lipid to protein ratios (greater than or equal to 40 w/w). At lower lipid to protein ratios, larger particles (diameter 7.5 nm) progressively appeared, resulting in bimodal particle size distributions up to a lipid to protein ratio of 1, where the large particles were the sole species present. These large particles were interpreted as corresponding to bacteriorhodopsin oligomers. Because of the large size and homogeneity of proteoliposomes, accurate particle density measurements could be performed. These confirmed the occurrence of a lipid to protein ratio-dependent bacteriorhodopsin monomer-oligomer equilibrium and further allowed us to identify the oligomer as a trimer or a tetramer. In complementary experiments, it was found that the bacteriorhodopsin monomer and oligomer had identical visible CD spectra and light-induced proton pumping rates. However, a large increase of the proton passive leak rate of proteoliposomes was found to be associated with oligomer formation. The appearance of these oligomers may be important as the first step in the formation of two-dimensional crystals of bacteriorhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W2023174268,"Bovine papillomavirus type 1 contains the smallest known oncogene (ORF E5), encoding a hydrophobic 44 amino acid protein. To study the biochemical functions of the E5 oncoprotein, we have chemically synthesized it and several deletion mutant peptides. We demonstrate induction of cellular DNA synthesis in growth-arrested cells by microinjection of E5 oncoprotein. This activity can be broken down into two functionally distinguishable domains. Remarkably, the first domain, which alone is sufficient to induce cellular DNA synthesis, contains only the C-terminal 13 amino acids. This is the smallest known protein fragment that can autonomously activate cellular DNA synthesis. The second domain is the hydrophobic middle region, which by itself fails to induce cellular DNA synthesis but confers a 1000-fold increase in specific activity. The N-terminal one-third of the molecule is dispensable for induction of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2412253612,"The effect of heavy metal ions (in particular Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+) on protein synthesis in hemin-supplemented reticulocyte lysates was investigated. Heavy metal ions were found to inhibit protein synthesis in hemin-supplemented lysates with biphasic kinetics. The shut off of protein synthesis occurred in conjunction with the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2, the loss of reversing factor (RF) activity, and the disaggregation of polyribosomes. Addition of eIF-2 or RF to heavy metal ion-inhibited lysates restored protein synthesis to levels observed in hemin-supplemented controls. The stimulation of protein synthesis observed upon the addition of cAMP to heavy metal ion-inhibited lysates correlated with the inhibition of eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation and the restoration of RF activity. The partial restoration of protein synthesis observed upon the addition of MgGTP to heavy metal ion-inhibited lysates correlated with a partial inhibition of eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation. Addition of glucose 6-phosphate was found to have no effect on protein synthesis of eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation under these conditions. Antiserum raised to the reticulocyte heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase inhibited the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha catalyzed by Hg2+-inhibited lysate. The inhibition of protein synthesis observed in the presence of heavy metal ions correlated with the relative biological toxicity of the ions. Highly toxic ions (AsO-2, Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+) inhibited protein synthesis by 50% at concentrations of 2.5-10 microM. Cu2+, Fe3+, and Zn2+, which are moderately to slightly toxic ions, inhibited protein synthesis by 50% at concentrations of 40, 250, and 300 microM, respectively. The data presented here indicate that heavy metal ions inhibit protein chain initiation in hemin-supplemented lysates by stimulating the phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha apparently through the activation of the heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase rather than through inhibition of the rate of eIF-2 alpha dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1507109135,"Ethanol enhances expression of cell surface class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens in a variety of cell lines; up to an eightfold increase is observed in an embryonic cell line. In ethanol-treated L cells, increased cell surface expression of MHC antigens occurs with a concomitant increase in steady-state RNA levels. This effect is promoter dependent and restricted, because not all gene products are elevated. The effective ethanol concentration (1%) is physiologically attainable, leading to speculations about the role of elevated MHC antigens in alcohol-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1559409985,"We investigated the effect of mechanical stimulation by an intermittent compressive force (ICF) on proteoglycan (PG) synthesis and PG structure in calcified and noncalcified cartilage of fetal mouse long bone rudiments. Uncalcified cartilaginous long bone rudiments were cultured for 5 days in the presence of [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine under control conditions (atmospheric pressure) or under the influence of ICF. ICF was generated by intermittently compressing the gas phase above the culture medium (130 mbar, 0.3 Hz). During culture, the center of the rudiments started to calcify. ICF stimulated calcification such that, after 5 days, the diaphysis of calcified cartilage was about two times as long as in the control cultures. At the end of the experiment, the rudiments were divided in a central calcified diaphysis and two noncalcified epiphyses. Diaphysis and epiphyses were pooled separately. PGs were extracted with 4 M guanidinium chloride and isolated by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. PGs (predigested with proteinase K or chondroitinase ABC) were characterized for hydrodynamic size of aggregates, monomers, and chondroitin sulfate chains by gel permeation chromatography and for degree of sulfation by ion exchange chromatography on high pressure liquid chromatography columns. ICF increased the amount of incorporated sulfate per tissue volume unit in the noncalcified epiphyses, but decreased this parameter in the calcified diaphysis. However, in both calcified and noncalcified cartilage, ICF increased the degree of sulfation of the chondroitin sulfate chains. No effects were found on the hydrodynamic size of the PG aggregates or monomers, but in the epiphyses ICF increased the size of the chondroitin sulfate chains. No other changes of structural characteristics of the macromolecules were observed. This study demonstrates that ICF generally stimulated the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into chondroitin sulfate chains. We conclude from the lowered [35S]sulfate content in calcified cartilage that ICF reduced the number of chondroitin sulfate chains and probably PGs while accelerating matrix calcification. It seems likely that the two effects are linked, indicating that a reduction of the number of chondroitin sulfate chains is part of the complicated process of cartilage calcification."
https://openalex.org/W1584417560,"The intramitochondrial localization of the urea cycle enzymes, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamoylase, has been examined by both in vitro and in situ studies. The following three lines of evidence are presented to establish that significant fractions of the rat liver enzymes are loosely associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane: 1) when the mitochondrion is fractionated, the enzymes partition between the matrix and membrane fractions in the absence of detergent and partition solely to the matrix in the presence of detergent; 2) the purified enzymes associate with purified inner membrane preparations; and, 3) protein A-gold electron microscopic immunocytochemical analysis of rat liver sections reveals a nonrandom arrangement of the enzyme, with the maximal enzyme density adjacent to the inner mitochondrial membrane. These findings serve as the basis for novel potential mechanisms for regulation of the activity of the enzymes and provide additional evidence for the extensive organization of the mitochondrial matrix. The membrane interaction might also serve as the organizing factor for a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-ornithine transcarbamoylase or other multienzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1597771089,"Cytochrome b5 holoenzyme was bound asymmetrically in the tightly bound form to small unilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles. [3H]Taurine, a membrane-impermeant nucleophile, was added to the external medium and was then cross-linked to cytochrome carboxyl residues by the addition of a water-soluble carbodiimide. Nonpolar peptide was isolated after trypsin digestion of taurine-labeled apocytochrome b5 and contained 1.7-1.9 residues of taurine. The C-terminal tetrapeptide containing residues Thr130-Asn133 was generated by chymotryptic hydrolysis of radiolabeled nonpolar peptide and was purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Amino acid analysis of the C-terminal tetrapeptide showed that about 1.6 mol of taurine was cross-linked per mol of peptide. When the experiment was performed with taurine trapped inside the vesicles, no cross-linking was observed. The results suggest that when cytochrome b5 holoenzyme is bound to vesicles in the tight binding form, the C terminus is located on the external surface of the vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W175162743,"An oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (FU) has been constructed by solid phase phosphotriester synthesis and has been studied in solution by proton NMR. In this study, we provide the first structural characterization of a DNA complex containing a FU.A base pair. It has been determined that the 7-mer duplex containing a central FU.A base pair adopts a normal right-handed configuration and the A residue in the FU.A pair is oriented in the normal anticonfiguration giving a Watson-Crick base pair. The significant difference between T.A and FU.A base pairs is dynamic, not structural: the FU.A base pair opens faster than normal base pairs in the oligonucleotide studied. We provide evidence that the FU.A base pair has a significantly enhanced opening rate resulting form decreased stacking of the 5-fluorouracil residue and not from the enhanced acidity of the 5'-fluorouracil imino proton."
https://openalex.org/W1524255469,"Calmodulin antagonists, including phenothiazine, sulfonamide, butyrophenone, and imidazolium derivatives, were in vitro inhibitors of pea mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. Inhibition was observed both during direct assay of the partially purified complex and during assay of pyruvate oxidation by isolated, intact mitochondria. When tested against the purified complex, the sulfonamide compound N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide (W-7) was a competitive inhibitor with respect to coenzyme A and an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to NAD and pyruvate. Inhibition of a process as crucial as mitochondrial respiration should serve to emphasize the care necessary in interpretation of whole-organism calmodulin antagonist studies."
https://openalex.org/W1588778199,"The biosynthesis of dolichol and dolichol-linked saccharide intermediates in glycoprotein synthesis was studied in an embryonic Drosophila cell line (Kc) that lacks the squalene-cholesterol branch of the polyisoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. Kc cells were labeled with [5-3H]mevalonic acid and the radioactive lipids formed were analyzed. Although the major labeled product was coenzyme Q, dolichol and a variety of dolichol derivatives could be readily detected. On the basis of their chromatographic and chemical properties, these derivatives were identified as dolichyl phosphate, glucosylphosphoryldolichol, mannosylphosphoryldolichol, and oligosaccharylpyrophosphoryldolichol. Both short term (4-h) and steady state (4-day) labeling experiments with mevalonate, rather than sugars as previously used, were performed to assess the level of these intermediates. The results of these studies, using a precursor common to all the intermediates, reveal that the early intermediates, N-acetylglucosaminylpyrophosphoryldolichol and N,N'-diacetylchitobiosylpyrophosphoryldolichol, are present at very low levels (less than 5%) relative to the other intermediates on the pathway to oligosaccharylpyrophosphoryldolichol. The total amount of dolichol intermediates remained essentially constant during the chase phase of pulse-chase experiments, indicating the absence of a major catabolic pathway for the polyisoprenoid backbone. As expected, however, the sugar moiety, studied with mannosylphosphoryldolichol, underwent rapid turnover. These results are discussed in the context of our current understanding of the pathway whereby dolichol derivatives participate in glycoprotein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1518137781,"Abstract Synthetic oligopeptide inhibitors of metalloendoprotease activity were found to inhibit catecholamine release from intact bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. The efficiency of these compounds in blocking secretion was dependent on the type and dose of the secretagogues employed. By contrast, catecholamine release from digitonin-permeabilized cells stimulated with micromolar calcium was virtually not affected. Using a different model system mimicking protein-mediated membrane fusion during exocytosis (Bental, M., Lelkes, P.I., Scholma, J., Hoekstra, D., and Wilschut, J. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 774, 296-300) we found that exposure of chromaffin granules to a genuine metalloendoprotease, thermolysin, impaired their fusion competence with liposomes. The same oligopeptide inhibitors of metalloendoprotease activity that interfered with secretion from the intact cells were also found to cause an increase in 45Ca2+ efflux concomitant with a slight elevation of the free intracellular calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) to levels not sufficient to elicit secretion. Subsequent stimulation of the cells in the presence of the potent inhibitors resulted in a reduced increase in the cytosolic calcium concentration, as compared to nontreated control cells. The reduction in the secretagogue-evoked rise in [Ca2+]i was also dependent on the time of pretreatment of the cells with the metalloendoprotease inhibitors. Consistently, none of these effects were seen with structurally similar oligopeptides that are not metalloendoprotease substrates/inhibitors. We conclude that potent inhibitors of metalloendoprotease activity and hence, presumably, the enzymes per se modulate stimulus-secretion coupling by interfering with calcium homeostasis rather than directly with membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1553708028,"Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) are the final two of six enzymatic steps required in the de novo biosynthesis of uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP). Earlier work of this laboratory showed that, in the mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, both of these enzymatic activities were contained on the single multifunctional polypeptide chain, UMP synthase. We report here that the placenta provided an available human source for UMP synthase with 40-fold higher orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase specific activities than erythrocytes, a human source previously used by others. By using the placenta as a source of UMP synthase and by developing a novel purification procedure different from that used in the purification of UMP synthase from the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (the only other homogeneous preparation of a mammalian UMP synthase), we achieved the purification of human UMP synthase to apparent homogeneity. This represents the first publication to homogeneity of UMP synthase from a human source as well as from a source other than malignant cell lines. Contrary to earlier reports human placental UMP synthase was found to be a multifunctional protein containing both enzymatic activities on a single polypeptide of 51,000 molecular weight. Preliminary characterization of the human placental UMP synthase showed it to be similar to UMP synthase from the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in subunit molecular weight, native molecular weight, isozyme pattern (although not absolute pI values), pH optima of enzymatic activities, and kinetic constants for orotidine 5'-monophosphate (Km) and 6-azauridine 5'-monophosphate (Ki) at the decarboxylase site."

T., Tanaka, H., and Soda, K. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3268-3274) and overproduced the enzyme in Escherichia coli W3110 lacIq using the tac promoter of PKK223-3. This system yields alanine racemase as 6% of the bacterial cytosolic protein. Purification by a modification of the procedure of Inagake et al. yielded 75 mg of homogeneous alanine racemase from 30 g of cells (wet weight). Large, well-formed crystals of alanine racemase have been grown from polyethylene glycol 8000 using vapor diffusion. These crystals have unit cell dimensions a = 85.3 A, b = 110.0 A, and c = 89.9 A. The crystals belong to space group P2(1), with beta fortuitously equal to 90 degrees within experimental error; however, they are frequently twinned by second order pseudomerohedry with twin fraction (the ratio of the volume of the smaller twin domain to the total volume of the crystal) ranging from about 0 to 0.5. Fortunately, for crystals with low twin fraction, computational methods have been developed for the analysis and correction of simple twinning (Fisher, R. G., and Sweet, R. M. (1980) Acta Crystallogr. A36, 755-760). The crystals contain two alpha 2 dimers of alanine racemase in the asymmetric unit. We have identified several potentially useful heavy atom derivatives in low resolution screening experiments and are proceeding with high resolution data collection."
https://openalex.org/W1589370248,"The binding of Ca2+ to troponin C (TnC) regulates skeletal muscle contraction. We have isolated a full-length cDNA clone for fast skeletal muscle TnC from a neonatal rabbit skeletal muscle library and determined its nucleic acid sequence. The amino acid sequence deduced from this clone matches the previously reported amino acid sequence (Collins, J. H., Greaser, M. L., Potter, J. D., and Horn, M. J. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6356-6362) except at the amino terminus. According to the nucleotide sequence, the first 2 residues of TnC are threonine-aspartic acid, which is the reverse of the order reported previously. The isolation of the adult form of TnC from a neonatal library suggests that there may be no developmental isoforms of fast TnC. The protein coding region of the fast TnC clone has 67% homology with the reported nucleotide sequence for chicken slow TnC (Putkey, J. A., Carroll, S. L., and Means, A. R. (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 549-1553). The homologies between the nucleotide sequences of TnC, calmodulin, and parvalbumin provide evidence that all three proteins were derived from a common precursor molecule which had four Ca2+-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1532840997,"We have investigated the function of a leucine residue in the transit peptide of the rat mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase precursor using in vitro mutagenesis. Amino acid replacement of leucine 13 with glutamic acid and asparagine abolished import into mitochondria, while substitutions with proline, histidine, and arginine severely diminished uptake. In contrast, glutamine, tyrosine, valine, and alanine replacement resulted in normal levels of import, suggesting that there is a requirement for an uncharged residue at this position. Mutants involving rearrangements of the native sequence at positions 12-14 were imported as efficiently as the wild-type mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, indicating that there was not an obligatory order of amino acid residues. However, deletion of leucine 13 resulted in diminished import. Binding studies with isolated mitochondria revealed that several position 13 mutants were deficient in binding to the mitochondrial surface, accounting for the reduced import of these proteins. This impairment could be distinguished from the effects due to decreased positive charge. We conclude that while translocation depends on the net positive charge, binding to the mitochondrial surface is mediated by uncharged residues within the transit peptides of mitochondrial precursor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1501394624,"After removal of the 66 COOH-terminal amino acids from each of its two heavy chains by chymotrypsin digestion, Acanthamoeba myosin II forms only parallel dimers under conditions in which native myosin II forms bipolar filaments (Kuznicki, J., Cote, G. P., Bowers, B., and Korn, E. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1967-1972). We have studied the solution structure of the chymotrypsin-cleaved myosin II by electric birefringence. Only two species, known to be monomer and parallel dimer from previous studies, were detected. The contribution to the birefringence decay from dimer increased from about 10 to 70% as the KCl concentration was lowered from 100 mM to 0 in 50% glycerol. At all ionic strengths, the monomer had a relaxation time corrected to water at 20 degrees C of 8.2 microseconds, whereas a relaxation time of 10.3 microseconds was expected for monomers with straight rigid rods. This strongly indicates that the myosin rod in solution is bent. On the assumption that there is a single bend 26 nm from the tip of the tail, as suggested by electron microscopy, it was calculated that the average bend angle would be 110 degrees, in solution, if as seems most likely, the average angle between the two globular heads were 180 degrees. The observed relaxation time of the dimer corrected to water at 20 degrees C was 25 microseconds, independent of ionic strength, which, if the motion of the heads were unrestricted, is consistent with a structure for a parallel dimer in which either the two monomer subunits have straight rigid rods and are staggered by about 28 nm or only one is bent and the stagger is 30 nm. As described in the accompanying Appendix, either of these dimers can be assembled into a bipolar filament compatible with the apparent structure of filaments of native myosin II (Pollard, T.D. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 95, 816-825)."

Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography demonstrated a band of Mr approximately 168,000 regardless of which cross-linker was used. The labeling of this band was specific in that it was prevented by excess unlabeled inhibitor and the apparent molecular weight of the cross-linked receptor-ligand complex was unchanged by treatment with reducing agent. The efficiency of the cross-linking was increased by increasing pH, and the extent of covalent cross-linking was dependent on the concentration of the bifunctional reagent. Octyl glucoside and sodium dodecyl sulfate were effective in solubilizing the receptor while Triton X-100 did not extract the receptor from the plasma membrane. These observations suggest that the 168-kDa binding species represents the 125I-sialoglycopeptide cross-linked to a specific plasma membrane receptor and that the receptor does not appear to contain interchain disulfide bonds."

This stimulus-sensitive phosphoprotein was isolated and purified to apparent homogeneity. A polyclonal affinity purified antibody made against the purified protein recognizes both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of the protein. The phosphorylated 63-kDa protein is found in the cytosolic fraction; it is slightly acidic with two isoelectric forms at pI 5.8 and 6.2 and probably exists as a monomeric 60-65-kDa polypeptide in the native state. The labeled phosphoamino acid of the protein is phosphoserine. The affinity purified antibody recognizes a third isoelectric form at pI 6.3 that appears unlabeled. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by showing that it immunoprecipitates the correct protein, i.e. the stimulus-sensitive 63-kDa phosphoprotein. The availability of purified 63-kDa protein as well as an antibody against it will now allow molecular, biochemical, and immunocytochemical studies into the role of this protein in the mechanism of exocytosis."

We found that the incorporation of [14C]tyrosine occurs almost exclusively into the nonassembled tubulin pool. The marginal band was practically not labeled. The low incorporation into microtubules was not due to the lack of tubulin with acceptor capacity since after cold-induced disassembly, an additional amount of [14C]tyrosine could be incorporated. 14C-Tyrosinated tubulin of the nonassembled pool could not be incorporated into microtubules of the marginal band after prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C or when the marginal band was regenerated after cold-induced depolymerization. In erythrocytes, tubulin:tyrosine ligase behaved as a soluble entity when the cells were lysed under microtubule-preserving conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1576240819,"Interactions of microtubules, neurofilaments, and microtubule-associated proteins were investigated by turbidity and falling-ball viscometry measurements. We found evidence of endogenous GTPase activity in neurofilaments and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in preparations that do not include urea or heat treatment, respectively. The absence or presence of either adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphonic acid or a GTP-regenerating system markedly influenced observed polymerization and gelation characteristics. Most significantly, the apparent viscosity of neurofilament and microtubule samples did not display a biphasic optimal MAP concentration profile when a GTP-regenerating system was operant. Likewise, GTP regeneration promoted the recovery of gelation following mechanical disruption of neurofilament/MAP/microtubule mixtures. These and other observations require some reassessment of proposed roles for microtubule-associated proteins in modulating neurofilament-microtubule interactions in vitro."

The characterization of apotrichodiol was established through the application of spectroscopic techniques (ultraviolet, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, COSY, and DEPT experiments) on the natural product as well as on its diacetate derivative. The mode of folding of its precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate was derived from feeding experiments with 3,4-[13C2]mevalonolactone. 13C-NMR assignments were also made of 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol and sambucinol which were derived from these feedings with enriched mevalonolactone."

The crystallographic structure was determined by rotation and translation searches utilizing the coordinates for ribonuclease A reported by Wlodawer and Sjolin (Wlodawer, A., and Sjolin, L.

https://openalex.org/W1574760836,"A method for the determination of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), which is associated with proteins in vivo, was developed. This method involves homogenization of tissue or cells in saturated, ice-cold solution of ammonium sulfate containing adenosine and S-adenosylmethionine to suppress unspecific binding of AdoHcy during sample processing. The homogenate was then extensively diluted, filtered, the precipitated protein washed, and AdoHcy extracted with perchloric acid. With this method it could be demonstrated that 30-50% of AdoHcy in rat liver and isolated rat hepatocytes is associated with proteins. Under physiological conditions, the major fraction of protein-bound AdoHcy resides in the microsomal fraction, whereas most free AdoHcy was recovered in the cytosol. The total AdoHcy content in hepatocytes could be markedly elevated by addition of adenosine or methionine. Under both conditions, protein-bound AdoHcy increased 2-fold and then leveled off, whereas free AdoHcy accounts for a further, massive, rise in intracellular AdoHcy. This suggests that AdoHcy is binding to saturable sites in vivo. AdoHcy in hepatocytes was labeled by incubating the cells with L-[35S]methionine, and within the first 60 min, free AdoHcy attained a significantly higher specific activity than protein-bound AdoHcy. Furthermore, chase with excess unlabeled methionine or with cycloleucine, revealed a shorter half-life of radioactive sulfur in free AdoHcy than in protein-bound AdoHcy. This shows that protein-bound and free AdoHcy represent kinetically distinct AdoHcy pools."

Data were collected at the end of a 3-min infusion period at steady state. Cardiac performance increased significantly whereas CPF decreased during histamine infusion. remained constant owing to a significant increase in myocardial oxygen extraction. Diphenhydramine attenuated the coronary vasoconstriction but potentiated the positive inotropic response. Cimetidine attenuated the inotropic and chronotropic responses but had no effect on coronary vasoconstriction. In combination, the histamine antagonists attenuated the changes in heart rate, contractility, and CPF. The histamine-induced increase in myocardial oxygen extraction was accompanied by a significant increase in in the presence of diphenhydramine. The ratio of the change in oxygen extraction to the change in oxygen consumption caused by histamine was significantly increased by diphenhydramine. This compensated for a histamine-induced decrement in the ratio of the change of CPF to the change in oxygen consumption. Cimetidine had no effect on the changes in coronary flow, oxygen consumption, or the above ratios. Thus, histamine causes direct coronary vasoconstriction via an H1 receptor mechanism, cardiac positive inotropy by an H2 receptor mechanism, and cardiac positive chronotropy by combined H1 and H2 mechanisms. In the presence of a histamine-induced decrease in myocardial oxygen supply, increments in oxygen demand are met by increased oxygen extraction.— Kang, Y. H.; Wei, H. M.; Fisher, H.; Merrill, G. F.

Concentrations of the organic phosphate up to about 5 mM resulted in an increase in S20,w, consistent with an increase in the fraction of tetrameric hemoglobin. A decrease in rapidly reacting hemoglobin parallelled the increase in the sedimentation coefficient. Between 5 and 20 mM 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, S20,w decreased, suggesting that dissociation to dimers was enhanced. An increase in rapidly reacting hemoglobin was also observed in this concentration range. Similar sedimentation results were obtained with oxyhemoglobin at pH 7.00 and carbon monoxide hemoglobin at pH 7.06. Assuming single binding sites on each species, the dissociation constants for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding to tetrameric and dimeric HbCO are 0.2-0.3 mM and 2-5 mM at pH 7.30. This biphasic effect of this physiologically important organic phosphate on the state of aggregation of R state hemoglobin has not been previously reported, but it is similar to that previously noted with inositol hexaphosphate, which enhanced tetramer formation at low concentrations, while at higher concentrations it promoted hemoglobin dissociation to dimers (White, S.

https://openalex.org/W1502898233,"The impact of delayed fibrinopeptide-A release on polymerization and structure of fibrin gels was studied utilizing a heterozygously transmitted variant fibrinogen. An arginine to histidine substitution at position 16 of the alpha chain of the abnormal fibrinogen delayed release of an abnormal fibrinopeptide-A (A) by thrombin and completely blocked release of A by reptilase. When clotted with thrombin, patient fibrin formed more slowly than normal fibrin, but clottability was normal and gel fiber mass/length ratios were decreased less than 10%. Gels formed with reptilase clotted slowly, demonstrated reduced clottability, but had normal fiber mass/length ratios. Reptilase clotted the normal but not the variant component of the patient fibrinogen. Thrombin-induced cleavage of fibrinopeptide-B prior to A occurred in these experiments, but polymerization of this species beyond trimers has been reported to be minimal under the conditions used. With time, A is removed by thrombin resulting in the slow production of normal fibrin monomer from the abnormal component. These monomers subsequently polymerize. The minimal change in gel fiber size caused by slow A release implies that fibrin fiber size is primarily a function of ionic environment and not of the sequence of peptide release."
