https://openalex.org/W2552591666,"The ability of cells to count and remember their divisions could underlie many alterations that occur during development, aging, and disease. We tracked the cumulative divisional history of slow-cycling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) throughout adult life. This revealed a fraction of rarely dividing HSCs that contained all the long-term HSC (LT-HSC) activity within the aging HSC compartment. During adult life, this population asynchronously completes four traceable symmetric self-renewal divisions to expand its size before entering a state of dormancy. We show that the mechanism of expansion involves progressively lengthening periods between cell divisions, with long-term regenerative potential lost upon a fifth division. Our data also show that age-related phenotypic changes within the HSC compartment are divisional history dependent. These results suggest that HSCs accumulate discrete memory stages over their divisional history and provide evidence for the role of cellular memory in HSC aging."

To directly examine the structural and dynamical properties of EGFR activation by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) in native membranes, we have developed a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR)-based approach supported by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In contrast to previous crystallographic results, our experiments show that the ligand-free state of the extracellular domain (ECD) is highly dynamic, while the intracellular kinase domain (KD) is rigid. Ligand binding restricts the overall and local motion of EGFR domains, including the ECD and the C-terminal region. We propose that the reduction in conformational entropy of the ECD by ligand binding favors the cooperative binding required for receptor dimerization, causing allosteric activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, Her1, or ErbB1) is one of the four members of the Her (ErbB) family of receptor tyrosine kinases that serves as cell-surface receptor for peptide ligands and plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Arteaga and Engelman, 2014Arteaga C.L.

ErbB proteins are linked to the development of different tumors (e.g., colorectal carcinoma, head and neck cancer, and gliomas) and represent a successful target for anti-cancer therapies using antibodies or small molecules inhibitors (Tebbutt et al., 2013Tebbutt N.

EGFR consists of an extracellular domain (ECD) formed by domains I to IV, a single-pass transmembrane (TM) domain, a juxtamembrane (JM) region, a tyrosine kinase domain (KD), and a C-terminal-region (CT), in which multiple potential tyrosine kinase substrate residues are located. Detailed structural information has been obtained for various EGFR segments, such as the ECD (Ferguson et al., 2003Ferguson K.M. Berger M.B. Mendrola J.M. Cho H.S. Leahy D.J.

Crystal structures have furthermore suggested that the non-liganded ECD can adapt a closed conformation that is stabilized by an intramolecular tether between domain II and IV (Ferguson et al., 2003Ferguson K.M. Berger M.B. Mendrola J.M. Cho H.S. Leahy D.J. Lemmon M.A. EGF activates its receptor by removing interactions that autoinhibit ectodomain dimerization.Mol.

On the other hand, the liganded ECD was found in an open, extended conformation leading to the intracellular active KD. Significant progress has been made in deciphering which interaction sites are involved in the stabilization of the EGFR dimer. They include the dimerization loops in domain II (Dawson et al., 2005Dawson J.P. Berger M.B. Lin C.-C. Schlessinger J. Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

These multiple interactions contribute to the cooperative formation and stabilization of the dimer of the wild-type (Dawson et al., 2005Dawson J.P. Berger M.B. Lin C.-C. Schlessinger J.

In spite of these studies, a unified structural view that describes the ligand-induced functional coupling between the ECD and the intracellular domain of the full-length receptor in a native membrane environment has remained elusive (Bessman et al., 2014Bessman N.J.

FRET, as well as molecular dynamics (MD) studies using EGFR in synthetic lipid bilayers, suggest that the unliganded EGFR ECD is located close to the membrane in the closed, tethered conformation (Arkhipov et al., 2013Arkhipov A. Shan Y. Das R. Endres N.F. Eastwood M.P. Wemmer D.E. Kuriyan J. Shaw D.E.

However, recent MD data from the ECD without membrane show a highly flexible fold (Arkhipov et al., 2013Arkhipov A. Shan Y. Das R. Endres N.F. Eastwood M.P. Wemmer D.E. Kuriyan J. Shaw D.E. Architecture and membrane interactions of the EGF receptor.Cell. 2013; 152: 557-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), which would explain the dynamic existence of predimers on cell surfaces (Low-Nam et al., 2011Low-Nam S.T. Lidke K.A. Cutler P.J. Roovers R.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Wilson B.S. Lidke D.S. ErbB1 dimerization is promoted by domain co-confinement and stabilized by ligand binding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1244-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). MD studies furthermore suggest that the dimerized EGFR ectodomain is lying flat on the membrane, thereby possibly explaining the negative cooperativity of ligand binding (Arkhipov et al., 2014Arkhipov A. Shan Y. Kim E.T. Shaw D.E. Membrane interaction of bound ligands contributes to the negative binding cooperativity of the EGF receptor.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10: e1003742Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent FRET studies speak in favor of an increased distance between domain I and the membrane after ligand binding in line with an upright position of the dimerized ECDs (Valley et al., 2015Valley C.C.

These studies, together with previous work highlighting the influence of native membrane lipids such as cholesterol (den Hartigh et al., 1992den Hartigh J.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. The EGF receptor is an actin-binding protein.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) or gangliosides (Coskun et al., 2011Coskun Ü.

USA. 2011; 108: 11332-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) for receptor activation and internalization, underline the notion that a comprehensive understanding of receptor activation requires the study of the full-length EGFR in its native environment. To address this aspect, we describe in the following the development and application of a solid-state NMR (ssNMR)-based approach to directly examine structural and dynamical properties of full-length EGFR in native membrane vesicles before and after activation. Unlike solution-state NMR, where small membrane proteins such as the transmembrane region of EGFR can be studied in membrane mimetics (Endres et al., 2013Endres N.F. Das R. Smith A.W. Arkhipov A. Kovacs E. Huang Y. Pelton J.G. Shan Y. Shaw D.E. Wemmer D.E. et al.Conformational coupling across the plasma membrane in activation of the EGF receptor.Cell. 2013; 152: 543-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), ssNMR can give detailed structural insight into the role of the bilayered membrane for protein structure in synthetic (Matsushita et al., 2013Matsushita C. Tamagaki H. Miyazawa Y. Aimoto S. Smith S.O. Sato T. Transmembrane helix orientation influences membrane binding of the intracellular juxtamembrane domain in Neu receptor peptides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 1646-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or native bacterial membranes (Kaplan et al., 2015Kaplan M. Cukkemane A. van Zundert G.C.P. Narasimhan S. Daniëls M. Mance D.

Methods. 2015; 12: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) largely irrespective of their size and mobility. In addition, ssNMR can probe changes in local or overall protein dynamics at ambient temperature by the reduction in signal intensity in dipolar-based experiments due to the presence of motion (Etzkorn et al., 2010Etzkorn M.

Soc. 2010; 132: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and by tracking ssNMR line width variations due to backbone fluctuations at low temperatures (Koers et al., 2014Koers E.J. van der Cruijsen E.A.W. Rosay M. Weingarth M. Prokofyev A. Sauvée C. Ouari O. van der Zwan J. Pongs O. Tordo P. et al.NMR-based structural biology enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization at high magnetic field.J. Biomol. NMR. 2014; 60: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Importantly, the latter studies are fully compatible with sensitivity enhancement methods such as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) that results in NMR signal enhancements by one to two orders of magnitude (Ni et al., 2013Ni Q.Z. Daviso E. Can T.V. Markhasin E. Jawla S.K. Swager T.M. Temkin R.J. Herzfeld J. Griffin R.G. High frequency dynamic nuclear polarization.Acc. Chem. Res. 2013; 46: 1933-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The combination of this high-sensitivity technique with tailored amino-acid labeling allows for the study of local protein structure even in complex molecular environments (Kaplan et al., 2015Kaplan M. Cukkemane A. van Zundert G.C.P. Narasimhan S. Daniëls M. Mance D. Waksman G. Bonvin A.M.J.J. Fronzes R. Folkers G.E. Baldus M.

To investigate EGFR in its native membrane environment by ssNMR, we utilized A431 cells to extract EGFR-enriched membrane vesicles amenable for NMR studies. For reference, we characterized these membrane vesicle preparations by electron microscopy, super-resolution light microscopy, and mass spectrometry (MS). Using previous structural information obtained for EGFR domains (Ferguson et al., 2003Ferguson K.M. Berger M.B. Mendrola J.M. Cho H.S. Leahy D.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) and assuming the C-terminal domain to be unstructured, we monitored EGFR structure and dynamics at global and residue-specific levels. Taken together, our NMR data reveal dynamics of specific EGFR regions in the unliganded state, which are strongly reduced by ligand binding, suggesting that a reduction in conformational entropy contributes to the free energy of EGFR dimerization. To investigate EGFR in its native membrane environment, we used A431 cells known to exhibit a high (1–2 × 106 receptors per cell) expression level of EGFR (Haigler et al., 1978Haigler H. Ash J.F. Singer S.J. Cohen S. Visualization by fluorescence of the binding and internalization of epidermal growth factor in human carcinoma cells A-431.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) to produce EGFR-containing membrane vesicles amenable for our multi-technique approach (Figure 1). Confocal microscopy of A431 cells and EGFR negative cells confirmed high-level expression of EGFR (Figure 2A). In addition, super-resolution light microscopy (dSTORM) experiments using anti-EGFR nanobodies and cryo-electron microscopy revealed the isolation of vesicles with a size of 50–250 nm, with EGFR localized to the membrane (Figures 2B and 2C). To determine the orientation of EGFR in these vesicles, we treated the vesicles with Proteinase K for 15 min at 4°C and analyzed the samples by western blotting using an antibody specific for the intracellular domain. Comparison of the EGFR protein band intensity using densitometry with the remaining intracellular domain band of 65 kDa suggests that approximately 85% ± 6.4 (mean ± SEM, n = 3) of EGFR is in the right outside-out orientation (Figure 2D). This was confirmed by three-color gated stimulated emission depletion (gSTED) microscopy, where the vesicles were stained with the lipophylic membrane stain DiI, EGF-A488, and an anti-EGFR nanobody conjugated to A647 (NB-A647). Almost all vesicles showed EGF binding (Figure 2E). Fluorescence intensity analysis of colocalized vesicles shows a high degree of correlation between the EGF-A488 and NB-A647 (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.577, N = 84, p < 0.001) (Figure 2F). In addition, we observed ligand-induced phosphorylation (Figure 2G), confirming high-level expression of functionally active EGFR in the isolated membrane vesicles. To probe the level of EGFR expression, we conducted MS experiments on A431 cells and the isolated membrane vesicles (Figure 3). Using an accepted semiquantitative approach based on summed ions intensities over all detected peptides we found actin to be the most abundant protein in whole A431 cells, followed by other abundant soluble molecules including heat shock and histone proteins. While the EGFR expression level was lower than these proteins, EGFR still represented the most abundant membrane protein in our cells in line with previous findings (Haigler et al., 1978Haigler H. Ash J.F. Singer S.J. Cohen S. Visualization by fluorescence of the binding and internalization of epidermal growth factor in human carcinoma cells A-431.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). When moving to isolated membrane vesicles, we found EGFR highly enriched by a factor 5.5 (Figure 3), making EGFR, together with actin, the most abundant protein in our membrane vesicles. As membrane proteins, such as EGFR, are typically less detectable by MS than soluble proteins (Santoni et al., 2000Santoni V. Molloy M. Rabilloud T. Membrane proteins and proteomics: un amour impossible?.Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1054-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), such as actin, we argue that the MS-based estimation of EGFR levels is at the lower limit. In summary, our results shown in Figures 2 and 3 confirmed the presence of high levels of functional EGFR in our isolated membrane vesicles. Such preparations are also advantageous with respect to the amount of protein in our ssNMR experiments, and we consequently prepared vesicles amenable for ssNMR studies by growing A431 cells on a medium containing [13C, 15N]-labeled algae mixture (Figure 1).Figure 2Structural and Functional Characterization of A431 Cells and Membrane VesiclesShow full caption(A) Confocal microscopy of A431 cells (bottom) and NIH 3T3 clone 2.2 cells (EGFR negative) (top) incubated with Alexa488-tagged EGF (in green).

(G) Phosphorylation assay of A431 plasma membrane vesicles to detect phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR) with anti-P1068 antibody. A431 cells were incubated at 37°C with (+) or without (−) EGF for 10 min. For membrane vesicles samples, either A431 cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 min with EGF (+), followed by vesicle preparation, or vesicles were first prepared from A431 cells, after which they were incubated at 37°C without (−) or with (+) EGF. Normalized intensities of the 20 most-abundant proteins in intact A431 cells (light blue) and corresponding intensities in membrane vesicles (dark blue). Intensities were calculated by summing the intensities over all peptides detected in the tryptic digests of the cells and vesicles for the annotated proteins. Intensities were normalized to the sum of peptide intensities detected in both vesicles and the whole-cell lysates. From the normalized intensities, enrichment factors (labels) were calculated, clearly revealing that of the 20 most-abundant proteins in cells, only EGFR is highly enriched in the membrane vesicles. Using [13C, 15N]-labeled A431 vesicles, we examined the effect of the addition of EGF (Figures 4 and S1) and of variations in temperature (253 and 285 K, Figures S1 and S2) on the resulting 1D and 2D ssNMR spectra. While signal intensities in frozen samples in the absence or presence of EGF were very comparable (Figure S1C), ssNMR intensities differed at ambient temperature, with a clear increase in signal intensity after addition of EGF (Figures S1D and 4), indicative of a ligand-induced structural stabilization of EGFR. Moreover, the overall 2D correlation pattern seen at lower temperatures (Figure S2) correlated with chemical-shift predictions on the basis of previous EGFR domain structures (Ferguson et al., 2003Ferguson K.M.

We suggest that this configuration efficiently captures and remodels exporting mRNP particles immediately upon reaching the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large cylindrical structure with eight symmetrically arranged spokes embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE) and is composed of multiple copies of ∼30 different nucleoporins (Nups). Discrete Nup subcomplexes associate to form the different substructures of the NPC, consisting of coaxial outer, inner, and membrane rings surrounding a central channel and linked to peripheral components such as the nuclear basket. Approximately one-third of all Nups, termed FG Nups, contain intrinsically disordered domains comprising multiple Phe-Gly (FG) repeats between hydrophilic spacers. These FG repeat regions populate the NPC central channel and, through their specific interaction with cargo-carrying transport factors, mediate transport (Knockenhauer and Schwartz, 2016Knockenhauer K.E. Schwartz T.U. The Nuclear Pore Complex as a Flexible and Dynamic Gate.Cell. 2016; 164: 1162-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although much of transport across the NPC is mediated by the karyopherin family of transport factors, the export of mRNAs follows a different mechanism that requires a special platform located at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, called the Nup82 complex in budding yeast (Oeffinger and Zenklusen, 2012Oeffinger M. Zenklusen D. To the pore and through the pore: a story of mRNA export kinetics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which in turn associates with Dyn2, Nup116, Gle2, and Gle1 (Folkmann et al., 2011Folkmann A.W. Noble K.N. Cole C.N. Wente S.R. Dbp5, Gle1-IP6 and Nup159: a working model for mRNP export.Nucleus. 2011; 2: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The central role of this complex is underscored by the fact that its mammalian homolog, the Nup88 complex, is a nexus for disease-associated mutations (Kaneb et al., 2015Kaneb H.M. Folkmann A.W. Belzil V.V. Jao L.E. Leblond C.S. Girard S.L. Daoud H. Noreau A. Rochefort D.

The Nup82 complex and its associated proteins have proven challenging for structural analyses due to their flexibility and the presence of intrinsically disordered domains. The core of the Nup82 complex is composed of the proteins Nup82, Nup159, and Nsp1. Fragments of each have been solved crystallographically (Chug et al., 2015Chug H. Trakhanov S. Hülsmann B.B.

USA. 2011; 108: 16571-16576Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and negative stain electron microscopy (EM) revealed this complex to have an overall “P”-shaped morphology (Gaik et al., 2015Gaik M. Flemming D. von Appen A. Kastritis P. Mücke N. Fischer J. Stelter P. Ori A. Bui K.H. Baßler J. et al.Structural basis for assembly and function of the Nup82 complex in the nuclear pore scaffold.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 208: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but no structures exist for either the whole complex or how it interacts with its associated proteins and the NPC. mRNA export is achieved in several stages. First, mRNAs, packaged into export-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, are docked into the nuclear basket; the mRNP particle then travels across the NPC through interaction of the non-karyopherin transport factors Mex67-Mtr2 with FG repeats that fill the NPC’s central channel (Oeffinger and Zenklusen, 2012Oeffinger M. Zenklusen D. To the pore and through the pore: a story of mRNA export kinetics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Once the mRNP particle reaches the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, the coordinated action of the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5, the nucleoporin Gle1, and the N-terminal β-propeller of Nup159 leads to active remodeling of the mRNP (Folkmann et al., 2011Folkmann A.W. Noble K.N. Cole C.N. Wente S.R. Dbp5, Gle1-IP6 and Nup159: a working model for mRNP export.Nucleus. 2011; 2: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Montpetit et al., 2011Montpetit B.

A conserved mechanism of DEAD-box ATPase activation by nucleoporins and InsP6 in mRNA export.Nature. 2011; 472: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mex67-Mtr2 and other transport factors are removed during remodeling (Lund and Guthrie, 2005Lund M.K. Guthrie C. The DEAD-box protein Dbp5p is required to dissociate Mex67p from exported mRNPs at the nuclear rim.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 645-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), preventing the mRNA from traveling back to the nucleus. In the final stage, the remodeled mRNA is released into the cytoplasm for translation. Unfortunately, the precise coordination of these processes at the molecular scale has not been elucidated, in large part due to the lack of sufficiently detailed information on the spatial arrangement of transport and remodeling components relative to each other and the NPC. Localization studies have led to the proposal that the Nup82 complex forms filaments that project orthogonally from the cytoplasmic face of the NPC; such a location would imply that exporting mRNPs must first transit the central channel of the NPC before being transferred out to these peripheral cytoplasmic filaments, where the final stages of mRNP remodeling and export would occur distally from the central channel of the NPC (reviewed in Folkmann et al., 2011Folkmann A.W.

Zenklusen D. To the pore and through the pore: a story of mRNA export kinetics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, exactly how this transfer would be accomplished, and how central channel transit and mRNP processing could be coordinated, remained unclear. To understand these processes, we solved the structure of the endogenous Nup82 complex by using an integrative approach that relies on multiple structural and proteomic data sources (Alber et al., 2007bAlber F. Dokudovskaya S. Veenhoff L.M. Zhang W. Kipper J. Devos D. Suprapto A. Karni-Schmidt O. Williams R. Chait B.T. et al.The molecular architecture of the nuclear pore complex.Nature. 2007; 450: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, Shi et al., 2014Shi Y. Fernandez-Martinez J. Tjioe E.

Proteomics. 2014; 13: 2927-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We also determined how the Nup82 complex is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC via the Nup84 complex, a seven-member assembly forming the outer rings. In addition, we used a combined structural and functional mapping analysis to elucidate the major mechanism responsible for mRNA export defects affecting Nup84 complex components. Finally, we integrate our data into a detailed map of the whole cytoplasmic mRNA export and remodeling machinery. We show that, surprisingly, the Nup82 complex positions the cytoplasmic FG repeats and mRNP remodeling machinery right over the NPC’s central channel rather than on distal cytoplasmic filaments, as previously supposed. We solved the structure of the endogenous native Nup82 holo-complex (Figure 1) using an integrative modeling approach that has previously allowed us and others to successfully determine the molecular architecture of numerous other large native assemblies (Sali et al., 2015Sali A.

Bonvin A.M. et al.Outcome of the first wwPDB Hybrid/Integrative Methods Task Force Workshop.Structure. 2015; 23: 1156-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Such integrative strategies have proven to be suited for the structural analysis of large endogenous complexes that are by nature flexible, contain unstructured regions, and are conformationally heterogeneous (Shi et al., 2014Shi Y. Fernandez-Martinez J. Tjioe E. Pellarin R. Kim S.J. Williams R. Schneidman-Duhovny D. Sali A. Rout M.P. Chait B.T.

Chait B.T. A strategy for dissecting the architectures of native macromolecular assemblies.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 1135-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We measured the native stoichiometry of the purified Nup82 holo-complex by a combination of QConCAT-MS (Pratt et al., 2006Pratt J.M. Simpson D.M. Doherty M.K. Rivers J. Gaskell S.J. Beynon R.J. Multiplexed absolute quantification for proteomics using concatenated signature peptides encoded by QconCAT genes.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1029-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and classical Siegel and Monte biophysical measurements (Figure S1; STAR Methods). The consensus of our analyses results in a stoichiometry of 2:2:2:2 (Nup159:Nup82:Nsp1:Dyn2), consistent with that previously measured (Gaik et al., 2015Gaik M. Flemming D. von Appen A. Kastritis P. Mücke N. Fischer J. Stelter P. Ori A. Bui K.H. Baßler J. et al.Structural basis for assembly and function of the Nup82 complex in the nuclear pore scaffold.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 208: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for a truncated overexpressed version of the complex, with the exception of the Dyn2 dimer, a labile component that, unless overexpressed (Figure S1E), is present as a single dimer in the average native complex. The morphology and dimensions of the complex were determined by negative stain EM, where 4,266 particles were classified into 23 class averages (Figure S2C); a majority of these (21) showed what appears to be a single dimer of Dyn2, in agreement with a previous study (Gaik et al., 2015Gaik M. Flemming D. von Appen A. Kastritis P. Mücke N. Fischer J. Stelter P. Ori A. Bui K.H. Baßler J. et al.Structural basis for assembly and function of the Nup82 complex in the nuclear pore scaffold.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 208: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and with our stoichiometry (see above), and were thus included in the calculation. Interestingly, two of the class averages seemingly presented two consecutive dimers of Dyn2 (Figure S2C, arrowheads), underscoring the previously observed heterogeneity of the complex in vivo (Gaik et al., 2015Gaik M. Flemming D. von Appen A. Kastritis P. Mücke N. Fischer J. Stelter P. Ori A. Bui K.H. Baßler J. et al.Structural basis for assembly and function of the Nup82 complex in the nuclear pore scaffold.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 208: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Instead of using a highly uncertain 3D map computed via single-particle reconstruction based on a heterogenous set of images, we relied on much more robustly computed 2D class averages, following a previously demonstrated procedure (Shi et al., 2014Shi Y. Fernandez-Martinez J. Tjioe E. Pellarin R. Kim S.J. Williams R. Schneidman-Duhovny D. Sali A. Rout M.P. Chait B.T.

Proteomics. 2014; 13: 2927-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Only the structured portions of the complex were constrained by the EM data, because we showed that the unstructured FG repeats are not revealed by negative stain EM (Figure S2D).Figure S2Cross-linking-MS and Negative Stain Electron Microscopy Analyses of the Nup82 Holo-complex, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Circos-XL plots showing the distribution of all DSS (left plot) and EDC (middle plot) cross-links identified within the native Nup82 holo-complex and to the substoichiometric component Nup116.

Protein representations were derived from the atomic structures in the Protein Data Bank, where available, or comparative models were built with MODELER 9.13 (Sali and Blundell, 1993Sali A.

Finally, the residue-specific spatial proximity and orientation of the different subunits were determined by a comprehensive chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometry readout (CX-MS) method, using two complementary cross-linkers (Figures 2A and S2A) (Shi et al., 2014Shi Y.

Proteomics. 2014; 13: 2927-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To reduce the intrinsic ambiguity of cross-link data arising from the presence of two copies of each protein, we also analyzed a strain expressing an exogenous homolog of Nup82 (skNup82) from the yeast Saccharomyces kudriavzevii (Borneman et al., 2012Borneman A.R. Desany B.A. Riches D. Affourtit J.P. Forgan A.H. Pretorius I.S. Egholm M. Chambers P.J.

We identified a total of 1,131 cross-links (Table S2) that include 662 unique disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) and 126 unique 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) cross-links from the wild-type yeast strain and 343 unique DSS cross-links from the skNup82-containing complex (Figure S2A). The majority of the identified inter-molecular cross-links mapped to the coiled-coil, C-terminal regions of Nup159 and Nsp1 and the whole Nup82 and Dyn2 proteins. Few inter-molecular cross-links were found to connect to the FG regions of Nup159 or Nsp1 and none connected to the β-propeller domain of Nup159, strongly indicating that those domains are dynamic, peripheral, and not located in proximity to the core of the complex (Gaik et al., 2015Gaik M.

https://openalex.org/W2553460354,"Mutations in TGFBR2, a component of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway, occur in high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC). In mouse models, Tgfbr2 inactivation in the intestinal epithelium accelerates the development of malignant intestinal tumors in combination with disruption of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway. However, no studies have further identified the genes influenced by TGFBR2 inactivation following disruption of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway. We previously described CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox mice, which is stochastically null for Apc in the colon epithelium. In this study, we generated CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox;Tgfbr2flox/flox mice, with simultaneous loss of Apc and Tgfbr2. These mice developed tumors, including adenocarcinoma in the proximal colon. We compared gene expression profiles between tumors of the two types of mice using microarray analysis. Our results showed that the expression of the murine homolog of GSDMC was significantly upregulated by 9.25-fold in tumors of CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox;Tgfbr2flox/flox mice compared with those of CDX2P-G19Cre;Apcflox/flox mice. We then investigated the role of GSDMC in regulating CRC tumorigenesis. The silencing of GSDMC led to a significant reduction in the proliferation and tumorigenesis of CRC cell lines, whereas the overexpression of GSDMC enhanced cell proliferation. These results suggested that GSDMC functioned as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation in colorectal carcinogenesis. In conclusion, combined inactivation of both Apc and Tgfbr2 in the colon epithelium of a CRC mouse model promoted development of adenocarcinoma in the proximal colon. Moreover, GSDMC was upregulated by TGFBR2 mutation in CRC and promoted tumor cell proliferation in CRC carcinogenesis, suggesting that GSDMC may be a promising therapeutic target."

To understand how temperature is represented in vivo, we used genetically encoded calcium indicators to measure temperature-evoked responses in hundreds of neurons across the trigeminal ganglion. Our results show how warm, hot, and cold stimuli are represented by distinct population responses, uncover unique functional classes of thermosensory neurons mediating heat and cold sensing, and reveal the molecular logic for peripheral warmth sensing. Next, we examined how the peripheral somatosensory system is functionally reorganized to produce altered perception of the thermal environment after injury. We identify fundamental transformations in sensory coding, including the silencing and recruitment of large ensembles of neurons, providing a cellular basis for perceptual changes in temperature sensing, including heat hypersensitivity, persistence of heat perception, cold hyperalgesia, and cold analgesia."
https://openalex.org/W2556015443,"The relationship between traditional metrics of research impact (e.g., number of citations) and alternative metrics (altmetrics) such as Twitter activity are of great interest, but remain imprecisely quantified. We used generalized linear mixed modeling to estimate the relative effects of Twitter activity, journal impact factor, and time since publication on Web of Science citation rates of 1,599 primary research articles from 20 ecology journals published from 2012-2014. We found a strong positive relationship between Twitter activity (i.e., the number of unique tweets about an article) and number of citations. Twitter activity was a more important predictor of citation rates than 5-year journal impact factor. Moreover, Twitter activity was not driven by journal impact factor; the 'highest-impact' journals were not necessarily the most discussed online. The effect of Twitter activity was only about a fifth as strong as time since publication; accounting for this confounding factor was critical for estimating the true effects of Twitter use. Articles in impactful journals can become heavily cited, but articles in journals with lower impact factors can generate considerable Twitter activity and also become heavily cited. Authors may benefit from establishing a strong social media presence, but should not expect research to become highly cited solely through social media promotion. Our research demonstrates that altmetrics and traditional metrics can be closely related, but not identical. We suggest that both altmetrics and traditional citation rates can be useful metrics of research impact."

Collagen is the main structural protein in the extracellular space and is produced in excess in patients with IPF and those with other organ fibrosis (13.Fulmer J.D. Bienkowski R.S. Cowan M.J. Breul S.D. Bradley K.M. Ferrans V.J. Roberts W.C. Crystal R.G. Collagen concentration and rates of synthesis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1980; 122: 289-301PubMed Google Scholar). Over 90% of the collagen in the human body is type I collagen (13.Fulmer J.D. Bienkowski R.S. Cowan M.J. Breul S.D. Bradley K.M. Ferrans V.J. Roberts W.C. Crystal R.G. Collagen concentration and rates of synthesis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1980; 122: 289-301PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of collagen is unique compared with other proteins due to its high glycine content, which constitutes approximately one-third of the amino acids in collagen (14.Shoulders M.D. Raines R.T. Collagen structure and stability.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 929-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). The high glycine content is critical for stabilization of collagen helix by facilitating hydrogen bonding and the formation of intermolecular cross-links (14.Shoulders M.D. Raines R.T. Collagen structure and stability.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 929-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). Glycine is the smallest of the 20 amino acids found in proteins. It is a non-essential amino acid as it is synthesized from serine, which is another non-essential amino acid that can be produced through the serine biosynthetic pathway. De novo synthesis of serine through the serine biosynthetic pathway diverges from glycolysis via a glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate, which is converted to serine in a three-step enzymatic reaction including the following enzymes in order: phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), and phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH). Serine then fuels glycine synthesis via two serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) genes; SHMT1, encoding the cytoplasmic isozyme (SHMT1), and SHMT2, encoding the mitochondrial one (SHMT2) (15.Amelio I.

Here, we show that TGF-β up-regulates glycolytic genes and flux in human fibroblasts. Inhibition of glycolysis resulted in the inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation and production of collagen protein without a significant change in transcription of α-1 type collagen and other TGF-β target genes. TGF-β induced the mRNA expression of most of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway as well as mRNA and protein expression of enzymes that play a role in de novo synthesis of serine and glycine, including PHGDH and SHMT2. Genetic deletion of PHGDH or SHMT2 and pharmacologic inhibition of PHGDH attenuated TGF-β-induced collagen protein production. Metabolic labeling studies showed incorporation of glucose-derived carbon into collagen protein in human fibroblasts. Furthermore, the expressions of both PHGDH and SHMT2 were increased in fibroblastic foci in lungs obtained from patients with IPF. Collectively, our results suggest that de novo synthesis of serine and glycine is required for collagen synthesis. This pathway may be a therapeutic target for treatment of organ fibrosis including IPF. Treatment of primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) (Lonza, Allendale, NJ) with active TGF-β (1 ng/ml) for 48 h results in increasing amounts of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, a marker for myofibroblast differentiation) and type I collagen in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To determine the effect of TGF-β on glycolysis, we treated HLFs with active TGF-β (1 ng/ml) or left untreated, and measured the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a surrogate for glycolytic lactate production using the Seahorse XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). ECAR was measured using the XF Glycolysis Stress Test Kit at 24 and 48 h after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 1B). Compared with the control-treated group, TGF-β caused a time-dependent increase in glycolysis and glycolytic capacity (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether the increased lactate production induced by TGF-β was due to up-regulation of specific glycolytic enzymes, we performed quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from HLFs 24 h after treatment of TGF-β. Heat map of differentially expressed genes after TGF-β treatment of 2 different primary cultures of HLFs are shown in Fig. 1D. Remarkably, compared with control, TGF-β caused increased expression of the majority of glycolytic enzymes including HK2, Aldolase A, Enolase 1, PKM2, and LDHA. The TGF-β-induced up-regulation of glycolytic enzyme gene expression (GLUT1 and PKM2 and LDHA) was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results suggest that TGF-β up-regulates the expression of glycolytic enzymes and glycolytic activity in HLFs. TGF-β signals through a receptor complex comprised of type I and type II receptors. To determine whether the effect of TGF-β on glycolysis was mediated via TGF-β receptor, we treated HLFs with TGF-β in the absence or presence of a TGF-β receptor I inhibitor, SB-431542 (10 μm), and measured ECAR and gene expression of glycolytic enzymes. Treatment with SB-431542 completely inhibited the TGF-β-induced increase in lactate production (Fig. 1F) and glycolytic enzyme gene expression (Fig. 1G). Because TGF-β up-regulated the expression of glycolytic enzymes and increased glycolytic activity, we sought to determine whether up-regulation of glycolysis was required for TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production. To evaluate the effect of glycolysis on the TGF-β-induced increase in lactate production, we treated HLFs with inhibitors of glycolysis including 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) (5 mm) and sodium oxamate (25 mm), which inhibit hexokinase and LDH, respectively, and measured ECAR. In another experiment, we substituted galactose for glucose to reduce glycolysis activity, because galactose enters glycolysis through the Leloir pathway, which occurs at a significantly lower rate than glucose entry into glycolysis (18.Weinberg F. Hamanaka R. Wheaton W.W. Weinberg S. Joseph J. Lopez M. Kalyanaraman B. Mutlu G.M. Budinger G.R. Chandel N.S.

Inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG or sodium oxamate or by substitution of glucose with galactose attenuated lactate production in HLFs (Fig. 2, A–C). To evaluate the effect of glycolysis on TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production, we treated HLFs with TGF-β in the absence or presence of 2-DG (1 and 5 mm), or sodium oxamate (10 and 25 mm) or galactose (25 mm), which was substituted with glucose to inhibit glycolysis. We then assessed α-SMA (myofibroblast differentiation marker) and collagen 1 protein expression at 24 and 48 h. Inhibition of glycolysis with 2-DG, sodium oxamate, or galactose substitution attenuated TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production (Fig. 2, D–F). To genetically confirm the effect of glycolysis on TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production, we generated HLFs with knockdown of LDHA using siRNA. Compared with control siRNA, HLFs with knockdown of LDHA had attenuation of TGF-β-induced collagen production and myofibroblast differentiation (Fig. 2G). We next sought to determine whether glycolysis was required for the transcriptional response to TGF-β. Binding of TGF-β to the type II receptor leads to recruitment and phosphorylation of the type I receptor. The type I receptor then phosphorylates receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMADs), such as SMAD2 and SMAD3, which bind the coSMAD, SMAD4. The R-SMAD/coSMAD complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the regulation of target gene expression. To determine whether glycolysis affects signaling and gene transcription downstream of TGF-β, we treated HLFs with TGF-β in the absence or presence of 2-DG, sodium oxamate, or galactose substitution, and performed Western blotting for SMAD3 and phosphorylated SMAD3 (phospho-SMAD3). Intriguingly, TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of SMAD3 was not affected by inhibition of glycolysis by 2-DG, sodium oxamate (Fig. 2H), or galactose substitution (Fig. 2I). We then evaluated whether glycolysis regulated the response to TGF-β at the gene transcription level. We treated HLFs with TGF-β in the absence or presence of 2-DG (5 mm) and assessed TGF-β-induced gene transcription at 24 h. Inhibition of glycolysis did not cause a significant change in expression of TGF-β target genes such as COL1A1, CTGF, or PAI-1 (Fig. 2J). Collectively, these results suggest that glycolysis is required for TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production without an effect on TGF-β-induced SMAD activation or gene transcription. Because the transcriptional response to TGF-β was unaffected by the inhibition of glycolysis, we hypothesized that biosynthetic reactions using glycolytic intermediates may promote the synthesis of TGF-β-induced proteins including collagen, the main structural protein in the extracellular matrix. Organ fibrosis including IPF is characterized by increased deposition of type I collagen, which makes up the majority (90%) of collagen in the human body. One-third of amino acids present in collagen are glycine. Because glycine is so abundant in collagen, we sought to determine whether de novo synthesis of glycine through the de novo serine synthesis pathway was up-regulated after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 3A). We treated HLFs with TGF-β and evaluated the expression of enzymes that regulate the de novo serine synthesis pathway. Compared with control, TGF-β up-regulated the gene expression of enzymes in the de novo serine synthesis pathway including 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (mitochondrial) (SHMT2) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (cytoplasmic) (SHMT1) gene expression was reduced following treatment with TGF-β (Fig. 3B). Complementing the transcriptional regulation of the de novo serine synthesis pathway enzymes, TFG-β stimulated up-regulation of the protein expression of these enzymes in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). In contrast to up-regulation of PHGDH and SHMT2, protein expression of the SHMT1 protein was reduced after TGF-β treatment similar to its mRNA expression (Fig. 3C). TGF-β-induced up-regulation of PHGDH and SHMT2 mRNA and protein expression was attenuated in HLFs treated with the TGF-β receptor I inhibitor, SB-431542 (10 μm) (Fig. 3, D and E). HLFs with SMAD3 knockdown displayed reduced levels of PHGDH and SHMT2 proteins, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of TGF-β on the expression of these enzymes was SMAD-dependent (Fig. 4). Because culture media contains a significant amount of serine and glycine, we formulated culture media that lacks serine, glycine, or both serine and glycine to determine the specific contribution of the de novo synthesis of glycine through the de novo serine synthesis pathway to collagen production. We then cultured HLFs in the absence of either serine, glycine, or both serine and glycine and treated them with TGF-β before we assessed the type I collagen expression. Removal of exogenous serine or glycine did not affect collagen production suggesting that de novo synthesis of glycine is sufficient for the production of collagen (Fig. 5A). In other words, de novo glycine synthesis is sufficient to provide the glycine necessary for collagen production. To investigate whether the de novo serine synthesis pathway is required for TGF-β-induced collagen production, we generated HLFs with knockdown of PHGHD or SHMT2 using siRNA (Fig. 5, B and C). Compared with control siRNA-treated cells, HLFs with knockdown of PHGHD or SHMT2 had attenuation of TGF-β-induced collagen production when the HLFs were cultured in media with serine and glycine (Fig. 5, B and C). When the HLFs with knockdown of PHGHD or SHMT2 were cultured in media lacking serine and glycine, TGF-β production was completely abolished (Fig. 5, D and E). To determine how pharmacologic inhibition of the de novo serine synthesis pathway affects collagen production, we treated HLFs with TGF-β in the presence or absence of a recently identified small molecule inhibitor of PHGDH (CBR-5884) (20.Mullarky E. Lucki N.C. Beheshti Zavareh R. Anglin J.L. Gomes A.P. Nicolay B.N. Wong J.C. Christen S. Takahashi H. Singh P.K. Blenis J. Warren J.D. Fendt S.M. Asara J.M. DeNicola G.M. et al.Identification of a small molecule inhibitor of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase to target serine biosynthesis in cancers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113: 1778-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Treatment of HLFs with CBR-5884 attenuated TGF-β-induced collagen production (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results support the importance of the de novo serine synthesis pathway in collagen production. To confirm that glucose-derived carbon is incorporated into collagen, we cultured HLFs with media that has either [12C]glucose or uniformly labeled [13C]glucose and treated the cells with TGF-β. Twenty-four hours after TGF-β treatment, lysates were resolved by electrophoresis and bands corresponding to collagen were isolated for analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. As seen in Fig. 7, collagen peptides from cells cultured in [13C]glucose showed increased peptide mass, consistent with incorporation of carbon from glucose into collagen. Collectively, these results suggest that de novo synthesis of glycine is sufficient and required for collagen production in HLFs. The conversion of serine to glycine by SHMT2 is an important source of 1-carbon units for the tetrahydrofolate (THF) cycle (21.Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R.

Exogenous formate can provide 1-carbon units directly to the THF cycle and can rescue cellular growth defects caused by loss of serine homeostasis (16.Pacold M.E. Brimacombe K.R. Chan S.H. Rohde J.M.

To determine whether the effect of SHMT2 inhibition on collagen production was due to loss of mitochondrial 1-carbon units, we cultured HLFs with SHMT2 knockdown in the presence or absence of exogenous formate both in the presence (Fig. 8A) and absence (Fig. 8B) of exogenous serine and glycine, and treated with TGF-β. Addition of formate failed to reverse the inhibition of collagen expression suggesting that it was not the loss of mitochondrial 1-carbon units that was responsible for the reduced collagen production we observed in SHMT2 knockdown cells (Fig. 8). Although we found reduced expression levels of the cytosolic SHMT1 in HLFs after TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 3, B and C), we sought to determine whether SHMT1 might still be required for collagen production. Knockdown of SHMT1 did not prevent induction of collagen synthesis downstream of TGF-β either in the presence or absence of exogenous serine and glycine (Fig. 9, A and B). This result is consistent with recent reports, which demonstrate that under most circumstances, SHMT1 catalyzes production of serine from glycine (16.Pacold M.E. Brimacombe K.R. Chan S.H. Rohde J.M.

Only when PHGDH or the mitochondrial THF cycle is inhibited does SHMT1 switch flux direction to produce glycine. To determine whether the expression of the de novo serine synthesis pathway enzymes is up-regulated during fibrosis in vivo, we performed Western blotting and immunohistochemistry staining for PHGDH and SHMT2 in lung tissues obtained from patients with IPF during lung transplantation and from healthy donors through an organ procurement organization. The expression of both PHGDH and SHMT2 was increased in lung homogenates from four patients with IPF compared with expression in four healthy donors (Fig. 10, A and B). Fibroblastic foci, which are dense collections of myofibroblasts and scar tissue, the main pathological feature of IPF, also demonstrated increased expression of both PHGDH and SHMT2 in fibroblasts (Fig. 10C). These results suggest the importance of the de novo serine synthesis pathway in fibrosis in vivo. Changes in cellular phenotype are accompanied by changes in cellular metabolite usage. Metabolic reprogramming has been studied extensively in cancer biology, and multiple therapeutics are currently in development in an attempt to target the metabolic dependences of cancer cells. The metabolic changes associated with other diseases, including fibrotic diseases have been less well studied. Tissue injury is followed either by appropriate wound healing or fibrosis characterized by excessive collagen deposition. For example, persistent lung injury causes fibrosis that is thought to result from an abnormal healing process that leads to increased deposition of extracellular matrix, which then causes progressive impairment of gas exchange due to replacement of alveoli with fibrotic tissue (3.Raghu G.

We conclude that polymerized actin provides mechanical force essential for all kinetically distinguishable forms of endocytosis at synapses. Endocytosis, a fundamental biological process, relies on mechanical force to mediate membrane invagination, formation of the Ω-shaped membrane profile, and Ω-profile fission (Saheki and De Camilli, 2012Saheki Y. De Camilli P. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005645Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). What molecule provides force for these steps is poorly understood. Actin, a force-generating molecule (Blanchoin et al., 2014Blanchoin L. Boujemaa-Paterski R. Sykes C. Plastino J. Actin dynamics, architecture, and mechanics in cell motility.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), provides forces for endocytosis in yeast (Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G.

However, its role in mammalian cells has been highly controversial (Saheki and De Camilli, 2012Saheki Y. De Camilli P. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

In non-neuronal mammalian cells, studies reached different conclusions as to whether and at which step actin is involved in endocytosis (Boulant et al., 2011Boulant S. Kural C. Zeeh J.C. Ubelmann F.

A dynamic actin cytoskeleton functions at multiple stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A recent study proposes that actin dynamics are only needed on surfaces under tension, which offers an explanation for the conflicting results (Boulant et al., 2011Boulant S. Kural C. Zeeh J.C. Ubelmann F. Kirchhausen T. Actin dynamics counteract membrane tension during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, this explanation is difficult to account for the large scale of conflicts at synapses, as discussed below. Latrunculin B, phalloidin, and swinholide A, which disrupt filamentous actin (F-actin) assemble/disassembly dynamics, cause accumulation of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles at lamprey giant synapses, suggesting a role of actin in endocytosis (Bourne et al., 2006Bourne J.

USA. 2002; 99: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, at the same lamprey synapse, latrunculin A, which disrupts actin polymerization, does not affect endocytosis detected with FM1-43 uptake (Bleckert et al., 2012Bleckert A. Photowala H. Alford S. Dual pools of actin at presynaptic terminals.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 3479-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Phalloidin, which stabilizes F-actin, reduces FM1-43 uptake and exocytosis to a similar extent, suggesting that phalloidin inhibits exocytosis, but not endocytosis (Bleckert et al., 2012Bleckert A. Photowala H. Alford S. Dual pools of actin at presynaptic terminals.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 3479-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At frog neuromuscular junctions, latrunculin A reduces FM1-43 uptake into nerve terminals (Richards et al., 2004Richards D.A. Rizzoli S.O. Betz W.J. Effects of wortmannin and latrunculin A on slow endocytosis at the frog neuromuscular junction.J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). While this observation could be interpreted as inhibition of endocytosis, it may reflect inhibition of exocytosis because latrunculin A reduces both exocytosis and FM1-43 uptake to a similar extent (Richards et al., 2004Richards D.A. Rizzoli S.O. Betz W.J. Effects of wortmannin and latrunculin A on slow endocytosis at the frog neuromuscular junction.J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytochalasin D, which inhibits actin polymerization, does not affect FM1-43 uptake or release, questioning a role of actin in endocytosis at frog neuromuscular junctions (Betz and Henkel, 1994Betz W.J. Henkel A.W. Okadaic acid disrupts clusters of synaptic vesicles in frog motor nerve terminals.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At hippocampal synapses, latrunculin A slows down spontaneous vesicle endocytosis (Hua et al., 2011aHua Y. Sinha R. Thiel C.S. Schmidt R. Hüve J. Martens H. Hell S.W. Egner A. Klingauf J. A readily retrievable pool of synaptic vesicles.Nat.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that actin’s role is limited to minimal stimulation. At goldfish retinal bipolar synapses, cytochalasin D does not affect vesicle recycling as detected with FM1-43 uptake and release (Job and Lagnado, 1998Job C. Lagnado L. Calcium and protein kinase C regulate the actin cytoskeleton in the synaptic terminal of retinal bipolar cells.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); latrunculin B and cytochalasin D do not affect endocytosis with a time course <∼20 s, but slow down bulk endocytosis (Holt et al., 2003Holt M. Cooke A. Wu M.M. Lagnado L. Bulk membrane retrieval in the synaptic terminal of retinal bipolar cells.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), questioning a general role of actin in all forms of endocytosis. A recent study showed that latrunculin A inhibits fast endocytosis at mossy fiber boutons (Delvendahl et al., 2016Delvendahl I. Vyleta N.P. von Gersdorff H. Hallermann S. Fast, temperature-sensitive and clathrin-independent endocytosis at central synapses.Neuron. 2016; 90: 492-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), consistent with inhibition of ultrafast endocytosis at hippocampal synapses (Watanabe et al., 2014Watanabe S. Trimbuch T. Camacho-Pérez M. Rost B.R. Brokowski B. Söhl-Kielczynski B. Felies A. Davis M.W. Rosenmund C. Jorgensen E.M. Clathrin regenerates synaptic vesicles from endosomes.Nature. 2014; 515: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In summary, the effects of actin blockers obtained at the same synapse, at different synapses, and for different forms of endocytosis are controversial. The present work aimed at determining whether actin is essential for various forms of endocytosis across different synapses and how actin acts on endocytosis. Since all previous studies rely on actin blockers, and some use only one blocker at one concentration, false-positive or false-negative results due to off-target effects or difficulty of drug access to actin in the in vivo condition (Bleckert et al., 2012Bleckert A. Photowala H. Alford S. Dual pools of actin at presynaptic terminals.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 3479-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) might contribute to the controversy. In the present work, we used the conditional actin gene knockout approach to study actin’s endocytic role in mammalian cells for the first time. Among six actin isoforms in mammalian cells, β-cytoplasmic actin (β-actin), encoded by Actb, and γ-cytoplasmic actin (γ-actin), encoded by Actg1, are ubiquitously expressed (Herman, 1993Herman I.M. Actin isoforms.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and are the predominant isoforms in the brain (Cheever and Ervasti, 2013Cheever T.R. Ervasti J.M. Actin isoforms in neuronal development and function.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2013; 301: 157-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since global knockout of β-actin is lethal (Shawlot et al., 1998Shawlot W. Deng J.M. Fohn L.E. Behringer R.R. Restricted beta-galactosidase expression of a hygromycin-lacZ gene targeted to the beta-actin locus and embryonic lethality of beta-actin mutant mice.Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, Shmerling et al., 2005Shmerling D. Danzer C.P. Mao X. Boisclair J. Haffner M. Lemaistre M. Schuler V. Kaeslin E. Korn R. Bürki K. et al.Strong and ubiquitous expression of transgenes targeted into the beta-actin locus by Cre/lox cassette replacement.Genesis. 2005; 42: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we generated mice with β-actin or γ-actin knockout specifically at calyx of Held and hippocampal synapses. We chose calyces because four kinetically different forms of endocytosis, including slow clathrin-dependent endocytosis (tens of seconds); rapid, presumably clathrin-independent endocytosis (a few seconds); bulk endocytosis (retrieving vesicles larger than regular vesicles); and endocytosis overshoot (retrieving more vesicles than exocytosed), can be recorded with capacitance measurements (Wu et al., 2014aWu L.G. Hamid E. Shin W. Chiang H.C. Exocytosis and endocytosis: modes, functions, and coupling mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2014; 76: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We chose hippocampal synapses because we can determine whether results obtained at large calyces apply to small conventional synapses, and electron microscopy can be used to determine the ultrastructural changes. Our results suggest that actin is essential in mediating all kinetically different forms of endocytosis by providing mechanical force to generate endocytic pits. We knocked out β-actin or γ-actin tissue specifically using krox20Cre mice, where krox20-driven Cre activity is limited to the lower auditory system, including calyces and postsynaptic neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) (Han et al., 2011Han Y. Kaeser P.S. Südhof T.C. Schneggenburger R. RIM determines Ca2+ channel density and vesicle docking at the presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2011; 69: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Breeding Krox20Cre mice with zsGreen reporter mice (Jackson Laboratory) (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3845) Google Scholar) yielded Krox20Cre/+; zsGreen+/− mice, in which zsGreen fluorescence overlapped with all 136 calyces (two mice) labeled with vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1; Figures S1A and S1B, available online). This result further supports the finding that Cre is present in calyx-containing neurons in krox20Cre mice (Han et al., 2011Han Y. Kaeser P.S. Südhof T.C. Schneggenburger R. RIM determines Ca2+ channel density and vesicle docking at the presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2011; 69: 304-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Breeding Krox20Cre/+ mice with ActbLoxP/LoxP mice, and subsequent breeding of Krox20Cre/+; ActbLoxP/+ mice with ActbLoxP/LoxP mice yielded Krox20Cre/+; ActbLoxP/LoxP mice (Actb−/−), in which β-actin was deleted in calyces. Similarly, we generated Krox20Cre/+; Actg1LoxP/LoxP mice (Actg1−/−) to delete γ-actin. Since calyces from ActbLoxP/LoxP mice, Actg1LoxP/LoxP mice, and wild-type mice exhibit similar properties (data not shown), we group these mice together as control mice. In control mice, immunostaining showed that β- and γ-actin were co-localized with vGluT1, which labeled vesicles in postnatal day 7 (P7)–P10 calyces (Figures 1A and 1B ). Similar labeling was observed at more mature P13–P14 calyces (Figures S1C–S1F), indicating the presence of β- and γ-actin throughout P7–P14. In Actb−/− or Actg1−/− mice, β- or γ-actin was nearly absent at P7–P10 calyces, respectively (Figures 1A and 1B). The remaining immunostaining was close to background staining (Figures 1A and 1B). These results suggest that krox20Cre successfully deleted β- or γ-actin in Actb−/− or Actg1−/− calyces, respectively. Deletion of β-actin in Actb−/− mice did not significantly affect expression of γ-actin (Figures 1A and 1B), or dynamin and syndapin, which may interact with actin, in calyces (Figure S2). Similarly, β-actin expression did not change significantly in Actg1−/− calyces (Figures 1A and 1B). We also bred Actb−/− and Actg1−/− mice to generate β- and γ-actin double-knockout mice (Krox20Cre/+; ActbLoxP/LoxP; Actg1LoxP/LoxP mice, or DKO mice). DKO mice were smaller than controls, but survived beyond P7–P10. However, no calyces can be identified, suggesting that actin is required for calyx development. We induced slow endocytosis (τ > ∼10 s) by applying a 20 ms depolarization from −80 mV to +10 mV (depol20ms) to calyces at the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration (Wu et al., 2009Wu X.S. McNeil B.D. Xu J. Fan J. Xue L. Melicoff E. Adachi R. Bai L. Wu L.G. Ca(2+) and calmodulin initiate all forms of endocytosis during depolarization at a nerve terminal.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). If not mentioned, recordings were made in P7–P10 calyces at 22°C–24°C. Depol20ms induced a calcium current (ICa) of 1.6 ± 0.1 nA and a capacitance (Cm) jump (ΔCm) of 362 ± 23 fF in control mice (n = 13 calyces, 13 mice; Figures 2A–2C). ΔCm was followed by a mono-exponential decay with a τ of 15.9 ± 1.9 s and an initial decay rate (Ratedecay) of 28 ± 4 fF/s (n = 13; Figures 2A–2C). Although both τ and Ratedecay reflected endocytosis rate, we used Ratedecay for statistics (Sun et al., 2010Sun T. Wu X.S. Xu J. McNeil B.D. Pang Z.P. Yang W. Bai L. Qadri S. Molkentin J.D. Yue D.T.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) because the decay τ was often too slow to estimate in knockout mice. The Ratedecay in Actb−/− (twelve calyces from eight mice) or Actg1−/− calyces (twelve calyces from nine mice) was reduced to ∼17%–24% of control (p < 0.01), whereas ICa charge (QICa) and ΔCm were not different (Figures 2A–2C; p > 0.1). Similar reduction was observed when (1) depol20ms was replaced with 20 action potential-equivalent stimuli (APes; 1 ms from −80 to +7 mV) (Wu et al., 2009Wu X.S. McNeil B.D. Xu J. Fan J. Xue L.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) at 100 Hz, which also induced slow endocytosis in control mice (Figures 2D–2F); (2) the temperature was increased to 34°C–37°C for 15–20 min (Figure 2G); or (3) P7–P10 was changed to P13–P14 (Figure 2H), at which calyces are more matured (Borst and Soria van Hoeve, 2012Borst J.G. Soria van Hoeve J. The calyx of Held synapse: from model synapse to auditory relay.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2012; 74: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of slow endocytosis by β- or γ-actin knockout is independent of the stimulation protocol, temperature, or developmental stage, suggesting involvement of actin in slow endocytosis. We noticed that endocytosis was not fully blocked by β-actin knockout (Figures 2G and 2H). This could be due to the presence of other actin isoforms like γ-actin. In control calyces, Ratedecay after depol20ms at 34°C–37°C for 15–20 min (67 ± 13 fF/s, n = 8; Figure 2G) was significantly higher than that (28 ± 4 fF/s, n = 13; Figures 2A–2C) observed at 22°C–24°C (p < 0.01, t test), consistent with the temperature-dependent acceleration of endocytosis observed at calyces and mossy fiber boutons (Delvendahl et al., 2016Delvendahl I.

Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 3349-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, ICa at 34°C–37°C was faster in kinetics and larger in amplitude (Figure S3), consistent with previous observations (Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007Renden R. von Gersdorff H. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis at a CNS nerve terminal: faster kinetics at physiological temperatures and increased endocytotic capacity during maturation.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 3349-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We applied 10 depol20ms at 10 Hz (depol20msX10) to induce rapid endocytosis (Wu et al., 2009Wu X.S. McNeil B.D. Xu J. Fan J. Xue L. Melicoff E. Adachi R. Bai L. Wu L.G. Ca(2+) and calmodulin initiate all forms of endocytosis during depolarization at a nerve terminal.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In control calyces (P7–P10, 22°C–24°C), depol20msX10 induced a ΔCm of 1,045 ± 53 fF, followed by a bi-exponential decay with τ of 1.7 ± 0.2 s (21% ± 2%) and 21.6 ± 1.4 s (n = 13; Figures 3A and 3B ), respectively. The Ratedecay was 180 ± 26 fF/s (n = 13; Figure 3C), which reflected mostly (∼80%) the rapid component of endocytosis (Sun et al., 2010Sun T. Wu X.S. Xu J. McNeil B.D. Pang Z.P. Yang W. Bai L. Qadri S. Molkentin J.D. Yue D.T. Wu L.G. The role of calcium/calmodulin-activated calcineurin in rapid and slow endocytosis at central synapses.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 11838-11847Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2009Wu X.S. McNeil B.D. Xu J. Fan J. Xue L. Melicoff E. Adachi R. Bai L. Wu L.G. Ca(2+) and calmodulin initiate all forms of endocytosis during depolarization at a nerve terminal.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The Ratedecay in Actb−/− (n = 12 calyces, 8 mice) and Actg1−/− calyces (n = 12 calyces, 9 mice) decreased to ∼20%–22% of that in control (p < 0.01), whereas QICa did not change significantly (Figures 3A–3C). ΔCm induced by depol20msX10 was 890 ± 95 fF (n = 12) and 795 ± 80 fF (n = 12) in Actb−/− and Actg1−/− calyces, respectively, which was ∼75%–84% of control (Figures 3A–3C; p < 0.05). Such a small ΔCm reduction is insufficient to account for the large Ratedecay decrease because, theoretically, the initial Cm decay rate is equal to ΔCm divided by the τ of the mono-exponential Cm decay. If τ does not change, a decrease of ΔCm to 77%–84% of control should linearly decrease the Ratedecay to ∼77%–84% of control, but not the observed 20%–22% of control. Thus, reduction of Ratedecay is largely not caused by ΔCm decrease, consistent with studies showing that block of endocytosis is not due to exocytosis decrease (reviewed in Wu et al., 2014aWu L.G. Hamid E. Shin W. Chiang H.C. Exocytosis and endocytosis: modes, functions, and coupling mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2014; 76: 301-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Similar reduction of Ratedecay in Actb−/− or Actg1−/− calyces was observed when (1) depol20msX10 was replaced with 200 APes at 100 Hz, which also induced rapid endocytosis in control (Sun et al., 2010Sun T. Wu X.S. Xu J. McNeil B.D. Pang Z.P. Yang W. Bai L. Qadri S. Molkentin J.D. Yue D.T. Wu L.G. The role of calcium/calmodulin-activated calcineurin in rapid and slow endocytosis at central synapses.J.

Ca(2+) and calmodulin initiate all forms of endocytosis during depolarization at a nerve terminal.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Figures 3D–3F); (2) the temperature was increased to 34°C–37°C (Figure 3G); or (3) P7–P10 was changed to P13–P14 (Figure 3H). These results suggest the involvement of actin in rapid endocytosis. Reduction of Ratedecay is not due to asynchronous release that counteracts endocytosis for two reasons. First, with 1 mM EGTA in the pipette to block calcium-dependent asynchronous release, Ratedecay after depol20ms or depol20msX10 in Actb−/− calyces (n = 8) was still much slower than control (n = 7; Figure S4). Second, the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) after 20 action potentials at 100 Hz decayed back to baseline within 1.5 s in both Actb−/− (n = 4) and control (n = 4) neurons (Figure S5), whereas the Cm decay did not return to baseline in 40 s after 20 APes at 100 Hz in Actb−/− calyces (Figure 2D). The prolonged Cm decay is thus not due to asynchronous release. Bulk endocytosis is detected as a brief downward Cm shift (DCS) of ∼20–500 fF at the whole-cell configuration (Wu and Wu, 2007Wu W. Wu L.G. Rapid bulk endocytosis and its kinetics of fission pore closure at a central synapse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10234-10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but can be down to 500 aF at the cell-attached configuration (He et al., 2009He L. Xue L. Xu J. McNeil B.D. Bai L. Melicoff E. Adachi R. Wu L.G. Compound vesicle fusion increases quantal size and potentiates synaptic transmission.Nature. 2009; 459: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We induced DCSs with 10 pulses of 50 ms depolarization from −80 to +10 mV at 10 Hz (depol50msX10) with 5.5 mM Ca2+ in the bath at the whole-cell configuration (Wu et al., 2009Wu X.S. McNeil B.D. Xu J. Fan J. Xue L. Melicoff E. Adachi R. Bai L. Wu L.G. Ca(2+) and calmodulin initiate all forms of endocytosis during depolarization at a nerve terminal.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In control calyces, the DCS frequency measured every 20 s was 0.0044 ± 0.0028 Hz at rest, but increased to 0.0246 ± 0.0050 Hz (n = 24 calyces, 18 mice) within 20 s after depol50msX10 (p < 0.01), and returned to baseline in the next 20 s (Figures 4A and 4B ), consistent with previous reports (Wu and Wu, 2007Wu W. Wu L.G. Rapid bulk endocytosis and its kinetics of fission pore closure at a central synapse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10234-10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2009Wu X.S. McNeil B.D. Xu J. Fan J. Xue L. Melicoff E. Adachi R. Bai L. Wu L.G. Ca(2+) and calmodulin initiate all forms of endocytosis during depolarization at a nerve terminal.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The DCS frequency within 20 s after depol50msX10 was only ∼25% of control in Actb−/− mice (n = 29 calyces, p < 0.01), and ∼19% in Actg1−/− mice (n = 18 calyces, p < 0.01) (Figures 4A and 4B). The DCS size did not change significantly (data not shown). Thus, bulk endocytosis is inhibited in Actb−/− and Actg1−/− mice. During DCSs, the fission pore conductance (Gp) changes can be measured (Figure 4C), allowing us to dissect endocytosis into two steps, the formation of an Ω-profile with a fission pore and fission pore closure (Wu and Wu, 2007Wu W. Wu L.G. Rapid bulk endocytosis and its kinetics of fission pore closure at a central synapse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10234-10239Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gp at the DCS onset that reflects initial fission pore size, and the rate of Gp change during DCS that reflects fission pore closure rate, were similar in control, Actb−/−, and Actg1−/− calyces (Figures 4C and 4D), suggesting that actin knockout may inhibit formation of the Ω-profile. Endocytosis overshoot (Renden and von Gersdorff, 2007Renden R. von Gersdorff H. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis at a CNS nerve terminal: faster kinetics at physiological temperatures and increased endocytotic capacity during maturation.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 3349-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) can be reliably induced by depol50msX10 with 5.5 mM Ca2+ in the bath (Xue et al., 2012Xue L. McNeil B.D. Wu X.S. Luo F.

Depol50msX10 induced an endocytosis overshoot of 620 ± 132 fF (n = 24 calyces) in control mice (e.g., Figure 4A; averaged in Figure 5A, left), but did not induce overshoot in Actb−/− (29 calyces; e.g., Figure 4C; averaged in Figure 5A, middle) or Actg1−/− mice (18 calyces; e.g., Figure 4E; averaged in Figure 5A, right).

https://openalex.org/W2565052129,"WZB117 (2-fluoro-6-(m-hydroxybenzoyloxy) phenyl m-hydroxybenzoate) inhibits passive sugar transport in human erythrocytes and cancer cell lines and, by limiting glycolysis, inhibits tumor growth in mice. This study explores how WZB117 inhibits the erythrocyte sugar transporter glucose transport protein 1 (GLUT1) and examines the transporter isoform specificity of inhibition. WZB117 reversibly and competitively inhibits erythrocyte 3-O-methylglucose (3MG) uptake with Ki(app) = 6 μm but is a noncompetitive inhibitor of sugar exit. Cytochalasin B (CB) is a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of 3MG uptake with Ki(app) = 0.3 μm but is a competitive inhibitor of sugar exit indicating that WZB117 and CB bind at exofacial and endofacial sugar binding sites, respectively. WZB117 inhibition of GLUTs expressed in HEK293 cells follows the order of potency: insulin-regulated GLUT4 ≫ GLUT1 ≈ neuronal GLUT3. This may explain WZB117-induced murine lipodystrophy. Molecular docking suggests the following. 1) The WZB117 binding envelopes of exofacial GLUT1 and GLUT4 conformers differ significantly. 2) GLUT1 and GLUT4 exofacial conformers present multiple, adjacent glucose binding sites that overlap with WZB117 binding envelopes. 3) The GLUT1 exofacial conformer lacks a CB binding site. 4) The inward GLUT1 conformer presents overlapping endofacial WZB117, d-glucose, and CB binding envelopes. Interrogating the GLUT1 mechanism using WZB117 reveals that subsaturating WZB117 and CB stimulate erythrocyte 3MG uptake. Extracellular WZB117 does not affect CB binding to GLUT1, but intracellular WZB117 inhibits CB binding. These findings are incompatible with the alternating conformer carrier for glucose transport but are consistent with either a multisubunit, allosteric transporter, or a transporter in which each subunit presents multiple, interacting ligand binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W2553697803,"Oocyte defects lie at the heart of some forms of infertility and could potentially be addressed therapeutically by alternative routes for oocyte formation. Here, we describe the generation of functional human oocytes following nuclear transfer of first polar body (PB1) genomes from metaphase II (MII) oocytes into enucleated donor MII cytoplasm (PBNT). The reconstructed oocytes supported the formation of de novo meiotic spindles and, after fertilization with sperm, meiosis completion and formation of normal diploid zygotes. While PBNT zygotes developed to blastocysts less frequently (42%) than controls (75%), genome-wide genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional analyses of PBNT and control ESCs indicated comparable numbers of structural variations and markedly similar DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles. We conclude that rescue of PB1 genetic material via introduction into donor cytoplasm may offer a source of oocytes for infertility treatment or mitochondrial replacement therapy for mtDNA disease."

Neuronal communication, critical for learning and memory, perception, thinking, and reaction, is enabled by synapses where the axonal presynaptic terminal of one neuron aligns with the postsynaptic membrane of another neuron. Efficient synaptic transmission is ensured by a high concentration of neurotransmitter receptors at the postsynaptic membrane (Sheng and Hoogenraad, 2007Sheng M. Hoogenraad C.C.

This is believed to be mediated by anchoring or scaffold proteins, such as PSD95 and gephyrin, which interact with glutamate receptors and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, respectively (Sheng and Sala, 2001Sheng M.

Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are a peripheral synapse formed between motor neurons and skeletal muscles. Large and easily accessible, they have contributed greatly to the understanding of synapse formation and neurotransmission (Sanes and Lichtman, 1999Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W.

At the NMJ, similar to synapses in the brain, the postjunctional membrane is packaged with acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at a concentration as high as 10,000 receptors/μm2 (Fertuck and Salpeter, 1976Fertuck H.C.

To better understand how rapsyn regulates NMJ formation, we analyzed its structure in relation to muscular dystrophy in human patients. Rapsyn mutations are most found in the TPRs (tetratricopeptide repeats), the coiled-coil domain, and regions in between (Engel et al., 2003Engel A.G. Ohno K. Sine S.M. Sleuthing molecular targets for neurological diseases at the neuromuscular junction.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast with lethality of rapsyn null (R−/−) in mice (Gautam et al., 1995Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Failure of postsynaptic specialization to develop at neuromuscular junctions of rapsyn-deficient mice.Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), many human mutations are not lethal, suggesting that they may be modulatory to rapsyn function (Engel et al., 2003Engel A.G. Ohno K. Sine S.M. Sleuthing molecular targets for neurological diseases at the neuromuscular junction.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mutation in the RING domain is rare; however, a partial deletion mutation of the RING domain causes fetal akinesia and premature termination of pregnancy (Vogt et al., 2008Vogt J. Harrison B.J. Spearman H. Cossins J. Vermeer S. ten Cate L.N. Morgan N.V. Beeson D. Maher E.R. Mutation analysis of CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, and RAPSN genes in multiple pterygium syndrome/fetal akinesia patients.Am.

These observations indicate an essential role of the RING domain in NMJ development. This domain is highly conserved among vertebrates including zebrafish, mouse, and human (Figures 1A and 1B ). In vitro data suggest that it could bind to β-dystroglycan (Lim and Campbell, 1998Lim L.E. Campbell K.P. The sarcoglycan complex in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1998; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a transmembrane protein that interacts with dystrophin and utrophin in the subplasmalemmal cytoskeleton (Apel et al., 1995Apel E.D.

Mutation of β-dystroglycan impairs muscle development, but its effect on NMJ formation appeared to be mild (Côté et al., 1999Côté P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Chimaeric mice deficient in dystroglycans develop muscular dystrophy and have disrupted myoneural synapses.Nat.

The dystroglycan complex is necessary for stabilization of acetylcholine receptor clusters at neuromuscular junctions and formation of the synaptic basement membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggesting additional functions of the RING domain. Here we provide evidence that the RING domain of rapsyn contains E3 ligase activity. Mutation of cysteine 366 in the first characteristic zinc finger abolished the enzymatic activity. We investigated the role of E3 ligase activity of rapsyn in AChR clustering and in NMJ formation by two genetic approaches. Results support a working model where rapsyn, a classic scaffold protein, serves as an E3 ligase to induce receptor clustering and NMJ formation, possibly by increasing neddylation of the AChR. These observations identify a previously unappreciated enzymatic function of rapsyn and reveal neddylation of neurotransmitter receptors as a novel mechanism in synapse formation. To determine whether the RING domain of rapsyn functions as an E3 ligase, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Flag-RING fusion protein was purified from bacteria and incubated with the ubiquitin activation enzyme (UbE1) and an ubiquitin conjugation enzyme (Ubc, E2). The E3 ligase activity of the RING domain was assayed by self-ubiquitin conjugation, a character of most E3 ligases (Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1C, rapsyn self-ubiquitination was detected when UbcH5A, 5B, 5C, and 6 were used as E2 conjugation enzymes. As control, self-ubiquitination was not detected on GST (Figure 1D) or with other E2 UbcHs (Figure 1C). Moreover, the E3 ligase activity was dose dependent (Figure 1E). To demonstrate that the E3 ligase activity requires the characteristic C2H2C3 motif, we generated C366A mutant by mutating the second cysteine of the motif to alanine. Mutation of the cysteine in RING-H2 E3 ligases has been shown to abolish the E3 ligase activity (Fang et al., 2000Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M.

As shown in Figure 1D, in contrast with wild-type (WT), the C366A mutant did not exhibit any detectable E3 ligase activity. These results indicate that rapsyn may function as an enzyme. To determine whether the enzyme activity of rapsyn is involved in NMJ formation, we generated human skeletal α-actin (HSA)-RWT and HSA-RC366A transgenic mice, which express WT or C366A mutant rapsyn under the control of HSA promoter (Figure S1A, available online). The HSA promoter drives protein expression specifically in muscle at embryonic day (E) 9.5 (Brennan and Hardeman, 1993Brennan K.J. Hardeman E.C.

The transgenes were expressed in muscles of transgenic mice at mRNA and protein levels (Figures S1B and S1C). Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that the transgene was expressed about 3-fold higher than endogenous rapsyn (Figure S1D). The transgenic mice were viable and fertile, and did not exhibit detectable deficits in NMJ morphology or function (Figures S1E–S1H) (data not shown). We bred HSA-RWT and HSA-RC366A transgenic mice with rapsyn null mutant mice to determine whether the expression of a respective transgene could rescue NMJ deficits caused by loss of rapsyn. As previously reported, rapsyn null (R−/−) mice displayed neonatal lethality and did not form the NMJ (Gautam et al., 1995Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Failure of postsynaptic specialization to develop at neuromuscular junctions of rapsyn-deficient mice.Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Expression of WT rapsyn in null mice prevented null mice from dying and the NMJs were observed in R−/−;HSA-RWT mice (Figures 2A and 2B ), demonstrating that muscle expression of WT rapsyn is able to rescue NMJ deficits of rapsyn null mice. In contrast, R−/−;HSA-RC366A mice died soon after birth with cyanosis, a sign of inability to breathe, suggesting that the C366A mutant is unable to rescue. We examined the NMJ morphology in the diaphragm by staining with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (BTX) to label AChR and with anti-synaptophysin/neurofilament antibodies to label axons and nerve terminals (Li et al., 2008Li X.M.

In WT mice, AChR clusters were located in the central region, surrounding primary phrenic nerve branches (Figure 2). However, in rapsyn null mice, there were no AChR clusters; primary branches remained in the central region, but there was extensive arborization of secondary and tertiary branches. The defects were rescued by expressing WT rapsyn in muscles (albeit not completely) (Figure 2). However, these rescue effects were not observed in R−/−;HSA-RC366A mice, in agreement with the notion that rapsyn E3 ligase activity is necessary for NMJ formation. The C366A mutation seemed to have little effect on rapsyn protein stability in HEK293T cells (Figure S2A) and on its binding to actin (Figure S2B). Moreover, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged rapsyn, either WT or C366A, was enriched at the NMJ (Figure S2C). Rapsyn has been shown to interact with AChR subunits (Maimone and Merlie, 1993Maimone M.M. Merlie J.P. Interaction of the 43 kd postsynaptic protein with all subunits of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Neuron. 1993; 11: 53-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether the C366A mutation disrupts rapsyn binding to AChR, we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) experiments in cells expressing differentially tagged rapsyn and AChR subunits. As shown in Figures S2D and S2E, C366A associated with AChR subunits as WT control. Next, we determined whether the enzyme activity of rapsyn regulates AChR cluster formation. Ideally, agrin-induced AChR clusters in muscle cells may serve as a readout; however, increasing rapsyn levels in cultured muscle cells are known to inhibit agrin-induced clusters (Han et al., 1999Han H.

Increased expression of the 43-kD protein disrupts acetylcholine receptor clustering in myotubes.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consequently, the effect of C366A mutation, if any, could be blurred by the inhibitory effect of rapsyn overexpression, which would make it difficult to interpret the results. To solve this problem, we studied the effect of the C366A mutation on AChR aggregates in heterologous cells, a strategy that has been used in previous studies (Borges et al., 2008Borges L.S.

https://openalex.org/W2555342158,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role in intracellular signaling during osteoclastogenesis. We previously reported that transcriptional factor nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), and that Nrf2 negatively regulated osteoclastogenesis via antioxidant enzyme up-regulation. Knockout mice of BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1)-the competitor for Nrf2 in transcriptional regulation-was known to attenuate RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis, although the mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that RANKL could be involved in the nuclear translocation of Bach1, which would attenuate Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes, thereby augmenting intracellular ROS signaling in osteoclasts. RANKL induced Bach1 nuclear import and Nrf2 nuclear export. Induction of Bach1 nuclear export increased Nrf2 nuclear import, augmented antioxidant enzyme expression, and, thus, diminished RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis via attenuated intracellular ROS signaling. Finally, an in vivo mouse bone destruction model clearly demonstrated that induction of Bach1 nuclear export inhibited bone destruction. In this study, we report that RANKL favors osteoclastogenesis via attenuation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzyme expression by competing with Bach1 nuclear accumulation. Of importance, induction of Bach1 nuclear export activates Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzyme expression, thereby attenuating osteoclastogenesis. Bach1 nuclear export might be a therapeutic target for such bone destructive diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and periodontitis.-Kanzaki, H., Shinohara, F., Itohiya, K., Yamaguchi, Y., Katsumata, Y., Matsuzawa, M., Fukaya, S., Miyamoto, Y., Wada, S., Nakamura, Y.

Emerging high throughput sequencing technologies have been proved to be a useful platform to understand the complex and dynamic disease processes. SLE patients categorised based on autoantibody specificities are reported to have differential immuno-regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq analysis to identify transcriptomics of SLE patients with distinguished autoantibody specificities. The SLE patients were segregated into three subsets based on the type of autoantibodies present in their sera (anti-dsDNA+ group with anti-dsDNA autoantibody alone; anti-ENA+ group having autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) only, and anti-dsDNA+ENA+ group having autoantibodies to both dsDNA and ENA). Global transcriptome profiling for each SLE patients subsets was performed using Illumina® Hiseq-2000 platform. The biological relevance of dysregulated transcripts in each SLE subsets was assessed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software. We observed that dysregulation in the transcriptome expression pattern was clearly distinct in each SLE patients subsets. IPA analysis of transcripts uniquely expressed in different SLE groups revealed specific biological pathways to be affected in each SLE subsets. Multiple cytokine signaling pathways were specifically dysregulated in anti-dsDNA+ patients whereas Interferon signaling was predominantly dysregulated in anti-ENA+ patients. In anti-dsDNA+ENA+ patients regulation of actin based motility by Rho pathway was significantly affected. The granulocyte gene signature was a common feature to all SLE subsets; however, anti-dsDNA+ group showed relatively predominant expression of these genes. Dysregulation of Plasma cell related transcripts were higher in anti-dsDNA+ and anti-ENA+ patients as compared to anti-dsDNA+ ENA+. Association of specific canonical pathways with the uniquely expressed transcripts in each SLE subgroup indicates that specific immunological disease mechanisms are operative in distinct SLE patients’ subsets. This ‘sub-grouping’ approach could further be useful for clinical evaluation of SLE patients and devising targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2553110899,"Renal involvement is one of the most severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Renal biopsy is the gold standard when it comes to knowing whether a patient has lupus nephritis, and the degree of renal disease present. However, the biopsy has various complications, bleeding being the most common. Therefore, the development of alternative, non-invasive diagnostic tests for kidney disease in patients with SLE is a priority. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are differentially expressed in various tissues, and changes in their expression have been associated with several pathological processes. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the abundance of miRNAs in plasma samples from patients with lupus nephritis that could potentially allow the diagnosis of renal damage in SLE patients. This is an observational case-control cross-sectional study, in which we characterized the differential abundance profiles of miRNAs among patients with different degrees of lupus compared with SLE patients without renal involvement and healthy control individuals. We found 89 miRNAs with changes in their abundance between lupus nephritis patients and healthy controls, and 17 miRNAs that showed significant variations between SLE patients with or without renal involvement. Validation for qPCR of a group of miRNAs on additional samples from lupus patients with or without nephritis, and from healthy individuals, showed that five miRNAs presented an average detection sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 70.3%, a positive predictive value of 82.5%, a negative predictive value of 96% and a diagnosis efficiency of 87.9%. These results strongly suggest that miR-221-5p, miR-380-3p, miR-556-5p, miR-758-3p and miR-3074-3p are potential diagnostic biomarkers of lupus nephritis in patients with SLE. The observed differential pattern of miRNA abundance may have functional implications in the pathophysiology of SLE renal damage."
https://openalex.org/W2551956856,"The molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in radiation nephropathy remain largely unknown. Podocytes are increasingly recognized as key players in the pathogenesis of proteinuria in primary and secondary glomerular disorders. The lipid-modulating enzyme sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3b) is a key determinant of podocyte injury and a known off target of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (RTX). The current study investigates the role of sphingolipids in radiation-induced podocytopathy. After a single dose of radiation (8 Gy), several ceramide species were significantly elevated. In particular, C16:00, C24:00, and C24:1 ceramides were the most abundant ceramide species detected. These changes were paralleled by a time-dependent drop in SMPDL3b protein, sphingosine, and sphingosine1-phosphate levels. Interestingly, SMPDL3β-overexpressing podocytes had higher basal levels of sphingosine1-phosphate and maintained basal ceramide levels after irradiation. Morphologically, irradiated podocytes demonstrated loss of filopodia and remodeling of cortical actin. Furthermore, the actin binding protein ezrin relocated from the plasma membrane to the cytosol as early as 2 h after radiation. In contrast, SMPDL3b overexpressing podocytes were protected from radiation-induced cytoskeletal remodeling. Treatment with RTX before radiation exposure partially protected podocytes from SMPDL3b loss, cytoskeletal remodeling, and caspase 3 cleavage. Our results demonstrate that radiation injury induces early cytoskeletal remodeling, down-regulation of SMPDL3b, and elevation of cellular ceramide levels. Overexpression of SMPDL3b and pretreatment with RTX confer a radioprotective effect in cultured podocytes. These findings indicate a potential role for SMPDL3b and RTX in radiation-induced podocytopathy.—Ahmad, A., Mitrofanova, A., Bielawski, J., Yang, Y., Marples, B., Fornoni, A., Zeidan, Y.H.

On one hand, we analyze their co-voting patterns and, on the other, their retweeting behavior. We make use of two diverse datasets in the analysis. The first one is the roll-call vote dataset, where cohesion is regarded as the tendency to co-vote within a group, and a coalition is formed when the members of several groups exhibit a high degree of co-voting agreement on a subject. The second dataset comes from Twitter; it captures the retweeting (i.e., endorsing) behavior of the MEPs and implies cohesion (retweets within the same group) and coalitions (retweets between groups) from a completely different perspective. We employ two different methodologies to analyze the cohesion and coalitions. The first one is based on Krippendorff’s Alpha reliability, used to measure the agreement between raters in data-analysis scenarios, and the second one is based on Exponential Random Graph Models, often used in social-network analysis. We give general insights into the cohesion of political groups in the European Parliament, explore whether coalitions are formed in the same way for different policy areas, and examine to what degree the retweeting behavior of MEPs corresponds to their co-voting patterns. A novel and interesting aspect of our work is the relationship between the co-voting and retweeting patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2554388458,"Reprogrammed metabolism and redox homeostasis are potential targets of cancer therapy. Our previous study demonstrated that the kidney form of glutaminase (GLS1) is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and can be used as a target for effective anticancer therapy. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels leading to cytotoxicity in cancer cells. However, the heterogeneity of cancer cells often leads to differing responses to oxidative lesions. For instance, cancer cells with high ratio of GSH/GSSG, a critical ROS scavenger, are resistant to ROS-induced cytotoxicity. We postulate that a combinatorial strategy firstly disrupting redox homeostasis followed by DHA might yield a profound antitumor efficacy. In this study, when HCC cells were treated with a GLS1 inhibitor 968, the ROS elimination capacity was significantly reduced in HCC cells, which rendered HCC cells but not normal endothelial cells more sensitive to DHA-mediated cytotoxicity. We further confirmed that this synergistic antitumor efficacy was mediated by excessive ROS generation in HCC cells. NAC, a ROS inhibitor, partly rescued the combinatorial cytotoxic effect of 968 and DHA. Given that GLS1 is a potential antitumor target and DHA has been safely used in clinic, our findings provide new insight into liver cancer therapy targeting glutamine metabolism combined with the ROS generator DHA, which can be readily translated into cancer clinical trials."

In particular, this study considered these punishment behaviors in in-group vs. out-group game settings, to compare how people behave with members of their own national group and with members of another national group. The results showed that participants act altruistically to protect in-group members. This study indicates that norm violation in in-group (but not in out-group) settings results in increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and temporo-parietal junction, brain regions involved in the mentalizing network, as the third-party attempts to understand or justify in-group members’ behavior. Finally, exploratory analysis during anti-social punishment behavior showed brain activation recruitment of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area associated with altered regulation of emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2550115673,"Endothelial thrombomodulin (TM) regulates coagulation and inflammation via several mechanisms, including production of activated protein C (APC). Recombinant APC and soluble fragments of TM (sTM) have been tested in settings associated with insufficiency of the endogenous TM/APC pathway, such as sepsis. We previously designed a fusion protein of TM [single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv)/TM] targeted to red blood cells (RBCs) to improve pharmacokinetics and antithrombotic effects without increasing bleeding. Here, scFv/TM was studied in mouse models of systemic inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Injected concomitantly with or before endotoxin, scFv/TM provided more potent protection against liver injury and release of pathological mediators than sTM, showing similar efficacy at up to 50-fold lower doses. scFv/TM provided protection when injected after endotoxin, whereas sTM did not, and augmented APC production by thrombin ∼50-fold more than sTM. However, scFv/TM injected after endotoxin did not reduce thrombin/antithrombin complexes; nor did antibodies that block APC anticoagulant activity suppress the prophylactic anti-inflammatory effect of scFv/TM. Therefore, similar to endogenous TM, RBC-anchored scFv/TM activates several protective pathways. Finally, scFv/TM was more effective at reducing cerebral infarct volume and alleviated neurological deficits than sTM after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. These results indicate that RBC-targeted scFv/TM exerts multifaceted cytoprotective effects and may find utility in systemic and focal inflammatory and ischemic disorders.-Carnemolla, R., Villa, C.

https://openalex.org/W2550201698,"γ-secretase mediates the intramembranous proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and determines the generation of Aβ which is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we identified that an anti-Parkinson's disease drug, Istradefylline, could enhance Aβ generation in various cell lines and primary neuronal cells of APP/PS1 mouse. Moreover, the increased generation of Aβ42 was detected in the cortex of APP/PS1 mouse after chronic treatment with Istradefylline. Istradefylline promoted the activity of γ-secretase which could lead to increased Aβ production. These effects of Istradefylline were reduced by the knockdown of A2AR but independent of A2AR-mediated G protein- or β-arrestin-dependent signal pathway. We further observed that A2AR colocalized with γ-secretase in endosomes and physically interacted with the catalytic subunit presenilin-1 (PS1). Interestingly, Istradefylline attenuated the interaction in time- and dosage-dependent manners. Moreover the knockdown of A2AR which in theory would release PS1 potentiated both Aβ generation and γ-secretase activity. Thus, our study implies that the association of A2AR could modulate γ-secretase activity. Istradefylline enhance Aβ generation and γ-secretase activity possibly via modulating the interaction between A2AR and γ-secretase, which may bring some undesired effects in the central nervous system (CNS)."
https://openalex.org/W2554119150,"Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein aggregates that are directly connected with the translation initiation arrest response to cellular stresses. Translation inhibition (TI) is observed in transient brain ischemia, a condition that induces persistent TI even after reperfusion, i.e. when blood flow is restored, and causes delayed neuronal death (DND) in selective vulnerable regions. We previously described a connection between TI and DND in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) in an animal model of transient brain ischemia. To link the formation of SGs to TI and DND after brain ischemia, we investigated SG induction in brain regions with differential vulnerabilities to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in this animal model. SG formation is triggered by both eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2α phosphorylation and eIF4F complex dysfunction. We analyzed SGs by immunofluorescence colocalization of granule-associated protein T-cell internal antigen-1 with eIF3b, eIF4E, and ribosomal protein S6 and studied eIF2 and eIF4F complex. The results showed that IR stress induced SG formation in the CA1 region after 3-day reperfusion, consistent with TI and DND in CA1. SGs were formed independently of eIF2α phosphorylation, and their appearance was correlated with a decrease in the levels of eIF4F compounds, the cap-binding protein eIF4E, and eIF4B, suggesting that remodeling of the eIF4F complex was required for SG formation. Finally, pharmacological protection of CA1 ischemic neurons with cycloheximide decreased the formation of SGs and restored eIF4E and eIF4B levels in CA1. These findings link changes in eIF4B and eIF4E to SG induction in regions vulnerable to death after IR."
https://openalex.org/W2553013812,"Highly aggressive, rapidly growing tumors contain significant areas of hypoxia or anoxia as a consequence of inadequate and/or irregular blood supply. During oxygen deprivation, tumor cells withstand a panoply of adaptive responses, including a shift towards anaerobic metabolism and the reprogramming of the transcriptome. One of the major mediators of the transcriptional hypoxic response is the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), whose stabilization under hypoxia acts as an oncogenic stimulus contributing to chemotherapy resistance, invasion and metastasis. Gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR is a powerful tool for cancer cells phenotypic characterization. Nevertheless, as cells undergo a severe transcriptome remodeling.in response to oxygen deficit, the precise identification of reference genes poses a significant challenge for hypoxic studies. Herein, we aim to establish the best reference genes for studying the effects of hypoxia on bladder cancer cells. Accordingly, three bladder cancer cell lines (T24, 5637, and HT1376) representative of two distinct carcinogenesis pathways to invasive cancer (FGFR3/CCND1 and E2F3/RB1) were used. Additionally, we have explored the most suitable control gene when addressing the influence of Deferoxamine Mesilate salt (DFX), an iron chelator often used to avoid the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α, acting as an hypoxia-mimetic agent. Using bioinformatics tools (GeNorm and NormFinder), we have elected B2M and HPRT as the most stable genes for all cell lines and experimental conditions out of a panel of seven putative candidates (HPRT, ACTB, 18S, GAPDH, TBP, B2M, and SDHA). These observations set the molecular basis for future studies addressing the effect of hypoxia and particularly HIF-1α in bladder cancer cells."

There is limited evidence on whether high body mass index also protects against TB infection; how very high body mass indices influence TB risk; or whether nutritional status predicts this risk in children. We assessed the impact of body mass index on incident TB infection and disease among adults and children.We conducted a prospective cohort study among household contacts of pulmonary TB cases in Lima, Peru. We determined body mass index at baseline and followed participants for one year for TB infection and disease. We used Cox proportional regression analyses to estimate hazard ratios for incident TB infection and disease. We enrolled 14,044 household contacts, and among 6853 negative for TB infection and disease at baseline, 1787 (26.1%) became infected. A total of 406 contacts developed secondary TB disease during follow-up. Body mass index did not predict risk of TB infection but overweight household contacts had significantly decreased risk of TB disease (HR 0.48; 95% CI 0.37-0.64; p <0.001) compared to those with normal weight. Among adults, body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m2 continued to predict a lower risk of TB disease (HR 0.30; 95% CI 0.12-0.74; p 0.009). We found no association between high body mass index and TB infection or disease among children under 12 years of age.High body mass index protects adults against TB disease even at levels ≥ 35 kg/m2. This protective effect does not extend to TB infection and is not seen in children."
https://openalex.org/W2555587221,"LIGHT (HVEM-L, TNFSF14, or CD258), an entity homologous to lymphotoxins, with inducible nature and the ability to compete with herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM)/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related 2, is a member of the TNF superfamily. It is expressed as a homotrimer on activated T cells and dendritic cells (DCs), and has three receptors: HVEM, LT-β receptor (LTβR), and decoy receptor 3 (DcR3). So far, three receptors with distinct cellular expression patterns are known to interact with LIGHT. Follicular DCs and stromal cells bind LIGHT through LTβR. We monitored the effects of LIGHT on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). At first, we checked the negative and positive differentiation markers of BM-MSCs. And we confirmed the quality of MSCs by staining cells undergoing adipogenesis (Oil Red O staining), chondrogenesis (Alcian blue staining), and osteogenesis (Alizarin red staining). After rhLIGHT treatment, we monitored the count, viability, and proliferation of cells and cell cycle distribution. PDGF and TGFβ production by rhLIGHT was examined by ELISA, and the underlying biological mechanisms were studied by immunoblotting by rhLIGHT treatment. LTβR was constitutively expressed on the surface of human BM-MSCs. Cell number and viability increased after rhLIGHT treatment. BM-MSC proliferation was induced by an increase in the S/G2/M phase. The expression of not only diverse cyclins such as cyclin B1, D1, D3, and E, but also CDK1 and CDK2, increased, while that of p27 decreased, after rhLIGHT treatment. RhLIGHT-induced PDGF and TGFβ production mediated by STAT3 and Smad3 activation accelerated BM-MSC proliferation. Thus, LIGHT and LTβR interaction increases the survival and proliferation of human BM-MSCs, and therefore, LIGHT might play an important role in stem cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2549186159,"Many studies have examined the application of soil amendments, including pH change-induced immobilizers, adsorbents, and organic materials, for soil remediation. This study evaluated the effects of various amendments on trace element stabilization and phytotoxicity, depending on the initial soil pH in acid, neutral, and alkali conditions. As in all types of soils, Fe and Ca were well stabilized on adsorption sites. There was an effect from pH control or adsorption mechanisms on the stabilization of cationic trace elements from inorganic amendments in acidic and neutral soil. Furthermore, acid mine drainage sludge has shown great potential for stabilizing most trace elements. In a phytotoxicity test, the ratio of the bioavailable fraction to the pseudo-total fraction significantly affected the uptake of trace elements by bok choy. While inorganic amendments efficiently decreased the bioavailability of trace elements, significant effects from organic amendments were not noticeable due to the short-term cultivation period. Therefore, the application of organic amendments for stabilizing trace elements in agricultural soil requires further study."

Experimental and in vitro studies reported that the function of these channels and pulmonary edema resolution are impaired in acute lung injury (ALI). Although current evidence indicates that alveolar fluid clearance is impaired in patients with ALI/diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), few human studies have addressed the alterations in pulmonary channels in this clinical condition. Additionally, it is not known whether the primary cause of DAD is a relevant variable for the channel dysfunction.Autopsied lungs of 43 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to DAD of three different etiologies, non-pulmonary sepsis, H1N1 viral infection and leptospirosis, were compared to 18 normal lungs. We quantified the expression of aquaporin (AQP) 1, AQP3, AQP5, epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and sodium potassium ATPase (Na-K-ATPase) in the alveolar septum using immunohistochemistry and image analysis.The DAD group presented with increased expression of AQP3, AQP5 and Na-K-ATPase and decreased expression of ENaC compared to controls. However, there was no difference in protein expression within the DAD groups of different etiologies.Water and ion channels are altered in patients with ARF due to DAD. The cause of DAD does not seem to influence the level of impairment of these channels."
https://openalex.org/W2553925121,"Occult HBV infection (OBI) has been reported in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers despite immunization. This study aims to determine the maintenance of this status in a prospective birth cohort.A total of 158 neonates born to HBsAg-positive mothers were enrolled. All received passive-active immunization against HBV according to a 0-1-6 schedule. Sera were collected at 7 months of age. Those diagnosed with OBI were serially followed up at 12, 24 and 36 months of age. HBV serological markers were determined by Abbott i2000 system. HBV DNA was quantitated by Abbott m2000 system. Standard PCR followed by direct sequencing were applied for mother-child HBV pairs. Homology and phylogenetic comparisons were done by BLAST and Mega 5.All the 158 neonates were HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs-positive at 7 months of age, and 32 (20.3%) of them were diagnosed with OBI, with a median HBV DNA level of 1.97 (1.20-3.71) log IU/mL. Of them, HBV DNA was positive in 25.0%, 21.9% and 7.7% at 12, 24 and 36 months of age, respectively. HBV DNA disappeared at one of the follow-up points in 31 neonates, however, rebounded to low levels in 6 of them thereafter. HBV DNA persisted at low levels during follow-ups in the other one neonate apart from the above 31. All remained negative for HBsAg. Only two (6.3%) neonates were positive for anti-HBc after 24 months of age. HBV showed close homology and phylogenetic relationships for mother-child pairs. S-escape mutant, G145R, was not discovered. The first vaccine dose within 6 hours of birth significantly reduced the occurrence of OBI (59.4% vs. 83.3%, p = 0.003).HBV may be controlled in immunized neonates of HBsAg-positive mothers, after being diagnosed with OBI. Timely vaccination against HBV may provide the utmost protection. Long-term and close monitorings are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2556262989,"Cytokine-like 1 (Cytl1) is a secreted protein that is involved in diverse biological processes. A comparative modeling study indicated that Cytl1 is structurally and functionally similar to monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). As MCP-1 plays an important role in cardiac fibrosis (CF) and heart failure (HF), we investigated the role of Cytl1 in a mouse model of CF and HF. Cytl1 was upregulated in the failing mouse heart. Pressure overload-induced CF was significantly attenuated in cytl1 knock-out (KO) mice compared to that from wild-type (WT) mice. By contrast, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of cytl1 alone led to the development of CF in vivo. The endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts (FBs) to myofibroblasts (MFBs) have been suggested to contribute considerably to CF. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of cytl1 was sufficient to induce these two critical CF-related processes in vitro, which were completely abrogated by co-treatment with SB-431542, an antagonist of TGF-β receptor 1. Cytl1 induced the expression of TGF-β2 both in vivo and in vitro. Antagonizing the receptor for MCP-1, C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), with CAS 445479-97-0 did not block the pro-fibrotic activity of Cytl1 in vitro. Collectively, our data suggest that Cytl1 plays an essential role in CF likely through activating the TGF-β-SMAD signaling pathway. Although the receptor for Cyt1l remains to be identified, Cytl1 provides a novel platform for the development of anti-CF therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2555572751,"Numerous behavioral paradigms have been developed to assess tinnitus-like behavior in animals. Nevertheless, they are often limited by prolonged training requirements, as well as an inability to simultaneously assess onset and lasting tinnitus behavior, tinnitus pitch or duration, or tinnitus presence without grouping data from multiple animals or testing sessions. To enhance behavioral testing of tinnitus, we developed a conditioned licking suppression paradigm to determine the pitch(s) of both onset and lasting tinnitus-like behavior within individual animals. Rats learned to lick water during broadband or narrowband noises, and to suppress licking to avoid footshocks during silence. After noise exposure, rats significantly increased licking during silent trials, suggesting onset tinnitus-like behavior. Lasting tinnitus-behavior, however, was exhibited in about half of noise-exposed rats through 7 weeks post-exposure tested. Licking activity during narrowband sound trials remained unchanged following noise exposure, while ABR hearing thresholds fully recovered and were comparable between tinnitus(+) and tinnitus(-) rats. To assess another tinnitus inducer, rats were injected with sodium salicylate. They demonstrated high pitch tinnitus-like behavior, but later recovered by 5 days post-injection. Further control studies showed that 1): sham noise-exposed rats tested with footshock did not exhibit tinnitus-like behavior, and 2): noise-exposed or sham rats tested without footshocks showed no fundamental changes in behavior compared to those tested with shocks. Together, these results demonstrate that this paradigm can efficiently test the development of noise- and salicylate-induced tinnitus behavior. The ability to assess tinnitus individually, over time, and without averaging data enables us to realistically address tinnitus in a clinically relevant way. Thus, we believe that this optimized behavioral paradigm will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms of tinnitus and development of effective treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2556292336,"Epigenetic aberrations play crucial roles in prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression. The DEFB1 gene, which encodes human ß-defensin-1 (HBD-1), contributes to innate immune responses and functions as a potential tumor suppressor in urological cancers. We investigated whether differential DNA methylation at the low CpG-content promoter (LCP) of DEFB1 was associated with transcriptional regulation of DEFB1 in PCa cells. To identify distinct CpG loci within the DEFB1 LCP related to the epigenetic regulation of DEFB1, we performed an in vitro methylated reporter assay followed by bisulfite sequencing of the DEFB1 promoter fragment. The methylation status of two adjacent CpG loci in the DEFB1 LCP was found to be important for DEFB1 expression in PCa cells. Paired epithelial specimens of PCa patients (n = 60), which were distinguished as non-tumor and tumor tissues by microdissection, were analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing of site-specific CpG dinucleotide units in the DEFB1 LCP. CpG methylation frequencies in the DEFB1 LCP were significantly higher in malignant tissues than in adjacent benign tissues across almost all PCa patients. These results suggested that methylation status of each CpG site in the DEFB1 promoter could mediate downregulation of DEFB1 in PCa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2549094133,"We study a simple agent-based model of the recurring fashion cycles in the society that consists of two interacting communities: ""snobs"" and ""followers"" (or ""opinion hunters"", hence the name of the model). Followers conform to all other individuals, whereas snobs conform only to their own group and anticonform to the other. The model allows to examine the role of the social structure, i.e. the influence of the number of inter-links between the two communities, as well as the role of the stability of links. The latter is accomplished by considering two versions of the same model-quenched (parameterized by fraction L of fixed inter-links) and annealed (parameterized by probability p that a given inter-link exists). Using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical treatment (the latter only for the annealed model), we show that there is a critical fraction of inter-links, above which recurring cycles occur. For p ≤ 0.5 we derive a relation between parameters L and p that allows to compare both models and show that the critical value of inter-connections, p*, is the same for both versions of the model (annealed and quenched) but the period of a fashion cycle is shorter for the quenched model. Near the critical point, the cycles are irregular and a change of fashion is difficult to predict. For the annealed model we also provide a deeper theoretical analysis. We conjecture on topological grounds that the so-called saddle node heteroclinic bifurcation appears at p*. For p ≥ 0.5 we show analytically the existence of the second critical value of p, for which the system undergoes Hopf's bifurcation."
https://openalex.org/W2549577010,"The Rac1 GTPase plays key roles in cytoskeletal organization, cell motility and a variety of physiological and disease-linked responses. Wild type Rac1 signaling entails dissociation of the GTPase from cytosolic Rac1-Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) complexes, translocation to membranes, activation by exchange factors, effector binding, and activation of downstream signaling cascades. Out of those steps, membrane translocation is the less understood. Using transfections of a expression cDNA library in cells expressing a Rac1 bioreporter, we previously identified a cytoskeletal feedback loop nucleated by the F-actin binding protein coronin 1A (Coro1A) that promotes Rac1 translocation to the plasma membrane by facilitating the Pak-dependent dissociation of Rac1-Rho GDI complexes. This screening identified other potential regulators of this process, including WDR26, basigin, and TMEM8A. Here, we show that WDR26 promotes Rac1 translocation following a Coro1A-like and Coro1A-dependent mechanism. By contrast, basigin and TMEM8A stabilize Rac1 at the plasma membrane by inhibiting the internalization of caveolin-rich membrane subdomains. This latter pathway is F-actin-dependent but Coro1A-, Pak- and Rho GDI-independent."

Polymorphisms within the surfactant protein (SP) A and B gene have been shown to predispose to RDS in preterm neonates. The aim of this study was to investigate whether specific SP-A and/or SP-B genetic variants are also associated with RDS in infants born late-preterm.This prospective cross-sectional study included 56 late-preterm infants with and 60 without RDS. Specific SP-A1/SP-A2 haplotypes and SP-B Ile131Thr polymorphic alleles were determined in blood specimens using polymerase-chain-reaction and DNA sequencing.The SP-A1 6A4 and the SP-A2 1A5 haplotypes were significantly overrepresented in newborns with RDS compared to controls (OR 2.86, 95%CI 1.20-6.83 and OR 4.68, 95%CI 1.28-17.1, respectively). The distribution of the SP-B Ile131Thr genotypes was similar between the two late-preterm groups. Overall, the SP-A1 6A4 or/and SP-A2 1A5 haplotype was present in 20 newborns with RDS (35.7%), resulting in a 4.2-fold (1.60-11.0) higher probability of RDS in carriers. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that the effect of SP-A1 6A4 and SP-A2 1A5 haplotypes was preserved when adjusting for known risk or protective factors, such as male gender, smaller gestational age, smaller weight, complications of pregnancy, and administration of antenatal corticosteroids.Specific SP-A genetic variants may influence the susceptibility to RDS in late-preterm infants, independently of the effect of other perinatal factors."

We analyzed the wall enhancement patterns, which were categorized into three patterns: thin, thick and nodular enhancement. ADC values were measured in the enhancing portions of the walls. The progression-free survival (PFS) related to the wall enhancement was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test.Statistically significant differences in the surgical cavity wall enhancement patterns was shown between the progression and non-progression groups (P = 0.0032). Thin wall enhancement was more frequently observed in the non-progression group, and thick or nodular wall enhancement were observed in the progression group (P = 0.0016). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean ADC values between the progression and non-progression groups. The mean PFS was longer in patients with thin wall enhancement than in those with nodular or thick wall enhancement (35.5 months vs. 15.8 months, P = 0.008).Pattern analysis of non-measurable surgical cavity wall enhancement on post-CCRT MR imaging might be useful tool for predicting prognosis of GBM patient before clear progression of non-measurable disease."
https://openalex.org/W2549803830,"Introduction Chorangiomas (CAs) are the most common non-trophoblastic tumor-like-lesions of the placenta. Although the clinical significance of small CAs is unknown, the large lesions are often associated with maternal and fetal complications. The aim of our study was to assess the maternal clinical characteristics and neonatal outcome in singleton and multiple pregnancies with placental CA. Materials and Methods Among 15742 selected placentas 170 CAs were diagnosed. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were analyzed in singleton (n = 121) and multiple (n = 49) pregnancy groups including 121 and 100 neonates, respectively. Results The frequency of APGAR score <7 at 5 minutes (p = 0,012), abnormal pulsatility index (p = 0,034), and abnormal blood flow class (p = 0,011) were significantly higher in neonates from singleton compared to multiple pregnancies. Significantly smaller CAs in singleton pregnancies were related to small for gestational age neonates (p = 0,00040) and neonates admitted to the neonatal care unit (p = 0,028). In singleton pregnancies, significantly smaller CAs were associated to maternal preeclampsia (p = 0,039) and larger CAs to multiparity (p = 0,005) and smoking (p = 0,001) groups. The frequency of preeclampsia was high in both singleton and multiple pregnancy groups (41,32% vs 26,53%, respectively), however, the difference did not reach the level of statistical significance. Discussion A high incidence of preeclampsia in cohort of placental CA might lead to a possible recognition of CAs as potential morphologic indicator of placental hypoxia. Conclusion A more favorable pregnancy outcome in multiple gestations compared to the singleton gestations with CAs might reflect an adaptive mechanism for increased demand of oxygen and associated placental tissue hypoxia in this group."
https://openalex.org/W2551997377,"This paper presents a robust satisficing decision-making method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) executing complex missions in an uncertain environment. Motivated by the info-gap decision theory, we formulate this problem as a novel robust satisficing optimization problem, of which the objective is to maximize the robustness while satisfying some desired mission requirements. Specifically, a new info-gap based Markov Decision Process (IMDP) is constructed to abstract the uncertain UAV system and specify the complex mission requirements with the Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). A robust satisficing policy is obtained to maximize the robustness to the uncertain IMDP while ensuring a desired probability of satisfying the LTL specifications. To this end, we propose a two-stage robust satisficing solution strategy which consists of the construction of a product IMDP and the generation of a robust satisficing policy. In the first stage, a product IMDP is constructed by combining the IMDP with an automaton representing the LTL specifications. In the second, an algorithm based on robust dynamic programming is proposed to generate a robust satisficing policy, while an associated robustness evaluation algorithm is presented to evaluate the robustness. Finally, through Monte Carlo simulation, the effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated on an UAV search mission under severe uncertainty so that the resulting policy can maximize the robustness while reaching the desired performance level. Furthermore, by comparing the proposed method with other robust decision-making methods, it can be concluded that our policy can tolerate higher uncertainty so that the desired performance level can be guaranteed, which indicates that the proposed method is much more effective in real applications."
https://openalex.org/W2555185698,"Latitudinal patterns in herbivory, i.e. variations in plant losses to animals with latitude, are generally explained by temperature gradients. However, earlier studies suggest that geographical variation in abundance and diversity of gall-makers may be driven by precipitation rather than by temperature. To test the above hypothesis, we examined communities of eriophyoid mites (Acari: Eriophyoidea) on leaves of Betula pendula and B. pubescens in boreal forests in Northern Europe. We sampled ten sites for each of five latitudinal gradients from 2008-2011, counted galls of six morphological types and identified mites extracted from these galls. DNA analysis revealed cryptic species within two of six morphologically defined mite species, and these cryptic species induced different types of galls. When data from all types of galls and from two birch species were pooled, the percentage of galled leaves did not change with latitude. However, we discovered pronounced variation in latitudinal changes between birch species. Infestation by eriophyoid mites increased towards the north in B. pendula and decreased in B. pubescens, while diversity of galls decreased towards the north in B. pendula and did not change in B. pubescens. The percentage of galled leaves did not differ among geographical gradients and study years, but was 20% lower in late summer relative to early summer, indicating premature abscission of infested leaves. Our data suggest that precipitation has little effect on abundance and diversity of eriophyoid mites, and that climate warming may impose opposite effects on infestation of two birch species by galling mites, favouring B. pendula near the northern tree limit."
https://openalex.org/W2554825343,"Purpose The objective of this study is to assess the prognostic value of ABO blood group in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the data on 1397 patients with non-metastatic, newly diagnosed NPC treated using IMRT. Patient survival between different ABO blood groups were compared using log-rank test. Cox hazards model was adopted to establish independent prognostic factors. Results In our study, the distribution of the A, B, AB and O blood groups was 26.6% (372/1397), 26.2% (366/1397), 5.2% (73/1397) and 42.0% (586/1397), respectively. The cut-off value of pre-treatment Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA based on disease-free survival (DFS) was 1355 copies/ml (area under curve [AUC], 0.649; sensitivity, 0.76; specificity, 0.496) for the whole cohort. Estimated four-year DFS, overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) rates were 81.7%, 89.2%, 89.4% and 92.3% for blood group A; 82.1%, 89.3%, 89.0% and 92.0% for group B; 83.3%, 88.1%, 86.2% and 95.5% for group AB, 80.9%, 90.7%, 88.4% and 90.2% for group O (P > 0.05 for all rates). Multivariate analysis revealed ABO blood group was not an independent prognostic factor for DFS, OS, DMFS or LRRFS (P > 0.05 for all rates) after adjusting for plasma EBV DNA in either the whole cohort or subgroup analysis by gender. Conclusions The prognostic value of ABO blood group may be limited for patients with NPC in the era of IMRT, and no substantial correlation between ABO blood group and plasma EBV DNA was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2556205641,"Objective The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a stressful environment for families of critically ill patients and these individuals are at risk to develop persistent psychological morbidity. Our study objective was to identify individual differences in coping with stress and information presentation preferences of respondents exposed to a simulated ICU experience. Methods Participants were recruited from a university and two community populations. Participants completed questionnaires that measured demographic information and characteristics that may be relevant to an individual’s ICU experience. Quality of life was measured by the EQ-5D, personality dimensions were examined with the abbreviated Big Five inventory, coping with stress was assessed with Brief COPE. Shared decision making preferences were assessed by the Degner Control Preferences Scale (CPS) and information seeking style was assessed with the Miller Behavioral Style Scale (MBSS). Social support was examined using an abbreviated version of the Social Relationship Index. Participants also completed a vignette-based simulated ICU experience, in which they made a surrogate decision on behalf of a loved one in the ICU. Results Three hundred forty-three participants completed the study. Three distinct coping profiles were identified: adaptive copers, maladaptive copers, and disengaged copers. Profiles differed primarily on coping styles, personality, quality of their closest social relationship, and history of anxiety and depression. Responses to the simulated ICU decision making experience differed across profiles. Disengaged copers (15%) were more likely to elect to refuse dialysis on behalf of an adult sibling compared to adaptive copers (7%) or maladaptive copers (5%) (p = 0.03). Notably, the MBSS and the CPS did not differ by coping profile. Conclusion Distinct coping profiles are associated with differences in responses to a simulated ICU experience. Tailoring communication and support to specific coping profiles may represent an important pathway to improving ICU experience for patients and families."

Methods Blood was sampled from the radial artery, portal vein, and hepatic vein before and after hepatic resection in 30 patients undergoing partial liver resection. Plasma SCFA levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. SCFA exchange across gut and liver was calculated from arteriovenous differences and plasma flow. Liver volume was estimated by CT liver volumetry. Results The gut produced significant amounts of acetate, propionate, and butyrate (39.4±13.5, 6.2±1.3, and 9.5±2.6 μmol·kgbw-1·h-1), which did not change after partial hepatectomy (p = 0.67, p = 0.59 and p = 0.24). Hepatic propionate uptake did not differ significantly before and after resection (-6.4±1.4 vs. -8.4±1.5 μmol·kgbw-1·h-1, p = 0.49). Hepatic acetate and butyrate uptake increased significantly upon partial liver resection (acetate: -35.1±13.0 vs. -39.6±9.4 μmol·kgbw-1·h-1, p = 0.0011; butyrate: -9.9±2.7 vs. -11.5±2.4 μmol·kgbw-1·h-1, p = 0.0006). Arterial SCFA concentrations were not different before and after partial liver resection (acetate: 176.9±17.3 vs. 142.3±12.5 μmol/L, p = 0.18; propionate: 7.2±1.4 vs. 5.6±0.6 μmol/L, p = 0.38; butyrate: 4.3±0.7 vs. 3.6±0.6 μmol/L, p = 0.73). Conclusion The liver maintains its capacity to clear acetate, propionate, and butyrate from the portal blood upon acute loss of liver tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2553039137,"Vaccinia virus (VACV) is a poxvirus, and the VACV D4 protein serves both as a uracil-DNA glycosylase and as an essential component required for processive DNA synthesis. The VACV A20 protein has no known catalytic function itself but associates with D4 to form the D4-A20 heterodimer that functions as the poxvirus DNA processivity factor. The heterodimer enables the DNA polymerase to efficiently synthesize extended strands of DNA. Upon characterizing the interaction between D4 and A20, we observed that the C terminus of D4 is susceptible to perturbation. Further analysis demonstrated that a conserved hexapeptide stretch at the extreme C terminus of D4 is essential for maintaining protein integrity, as assessed by its requirement for the production of soluble recombinant protein that is functional in processive DNA synthesis. From the known crystal structures of D4, the C-terminal hexapeptide is shown to make intramolecular contact with residues spanning the inner core of the protein. Our mutational analysis revealed that a tripeptide motif (215GFI217) within the hexapeptide comprises apparent residues necessary for the contact. Prediction of protein disorder identified the hexapeptide and several regions upstream of Gly215 that comprise residues of the interface surfaces of the D4-A20 heterodimer. Our study suggests that 215GFI217 anchors these potentially dynamic upstream regions of the protein to maintain protein integrity. Unlike uracil-DNA glycosylases from diverse sources, where the C termini are disordered and do not form comparable intramolecular contacts, this feature may be unique to orthopoxviruses.

Processivity factors serve to tether their cognate DNA polymerases onto the template to permit the synthesis of long extended strands of DNA. In the absence of its processivity factor, the polymerase will fall off the template after limited nucleotide incorporation. Processivity factors are categorized into two classes. The first class consists of ring-shaped assemblies of identical subunits that completely encircle the DNA template through the action of ATP-driven clamp loaders (1.Ellison V. Stillman B.

Viral DNA synthesis is dependent upon at least six virally encoded proteins (14.Moss B. Poxvirus DNA Replication.Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: 1-12Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar).

Although nearly all DNA viruses encode a single protein that functions as a processivity factor, poxviruses are unique in that the processivity factor is composed of two virally encoded proteins: A20 and D4 (15.Upton C.

D4 is a 25-kDa protein that is essential for viral replication and viability (15.Upton C. Stuart D.T. McFadden G. Identification of a poxvirus gene encoding a uracil DNA glycosylase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 4518-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16.Stuart D.T. Upton C. Higman M.A. Niles E.G. McFadden G.

The vaccinia virus-encoded uracil DNA glycosylase has an essential role in viral DNA replication.Virology. 1994; 198: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because D4 is unable to bind viral DNA polymerase directly, it utilizes A20 as a bridge. In this manner, D4 indirectly tethers viral DNA polymerase onto the DNA template. With its inherent uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) activity, it was recently hypothesized that the template-scanning action of the UDG is utilized by D4 to confer the processive DNA synthesis activity by the DNA polymerase (22.Boyle K.A. Stanitsa E.S. Greseth M.D. Lindgren J.K. Traktman P. Evaluation of the role of the vaccinia virus uracil DNA glycosylase and A20 proteins as intrinsic components of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme.J.

Recent structural evidence further supports the heterodimer model when both A20 and D4 are present (26.Sèle C. Gabel F. Gutsche I. Ivanov I. Burmeister W.P. Iseni F. Tarbouriech N.

This would suggest the formation of the heterodimer as energetically favored and, therefore, a likely biologically relevant model of the processivity factor. With respect to the protein binding surfaces on D4, the crystal structures of the D4 homodimer and the D4-A20 heterodimer show overlapping residues at the protein-protein interface (24.Schormann N. Grigorian A. Samal A. Krishnan R. DeLucas L. Chattopadhyay D. Crystal structure of vaccinia virus uracil-DNA glycosylase reveals dimeric assembly.BMC Struct.

Both of the contact surfaces are relatively large and featureless and involve a significant amount of hydrophobic residues, with the preference for the heterodimer suggested by the larger contact surface area (1890 Å2 of buried surface) and key hydrogen bonds not observed (27.Contesto-Richefeu C. Tarbouriech N. Brazzolotto X. Betzi S. Morelli X. Burmeister W.P. Iseni F.

Biol. 2007; 7: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To gain a greater understanding of the formation of the D4-A20 heterodimer, we sought to characterize the biophysical interaction of D4 with A20 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The results of our binding studies indicated complex protein binding behavior. The reported crystal structures of D4 (either as a homodimer or heterodimer) implied that it is relatively rigid. This was a surprising revelation that provided the impetus to investigate its solution properties further. Ultimately, deletion analysis showed that a short hexapeptide stretch at the C terminus of D4 is necessary for maintaining protein integrity and function. From the known crystal structures of D4, it appears that the hexapeptide makes contact with residues spanning the core of the protein. Using mutagenesis studies, we further revealed that a tripeptide motif (215GFI217, based on VACV numbering) within the hexapeptide is necessary for maintaining the intramolecular contact. We discuss how this unique intramolecular contact serves to maintain protein integrity and function. The D4-A20 heterodimer functions as the poxvirus processivity factor required for viral DNA synthesis (21.Druck Shudofsky A.M. Silverman J.E. Chattopadhyay D. Ricciardi R.P.

In the case of A20, the full-length protein has not been successfully isolated to investigate its biophysical properties, such as structure elucidation and interaction with D4. Thus, although the production of full-length A20 remains a challenge, the truncated versions of this protein have provided valuable insights. Indeed, the use of a yeast two-hybrid assay had earlier identified the N-terminal 25 amino acids of A20 as the minimal requirement for D4 binding, with increased affinity observed when extended to 50 amino acids and longer (25.Ishii K. Moss B. Mapping interaction sites of the A20R protein component of the vaccinia virus DNA replication complex.Virology. 2002; 303: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The de novo protein folds of both the N-terminal 25 and 50 amino acids were predicted to consist of two α helices (28.Nuth M. Guan H. Zhukovskaya N. Saw Y.L. Ricciardi R.P. Design of potent poxvirus inhibitors of the heterodimeric processivity factor required for viral replication.J. Med. Chem. 2013; 56: 3235-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with the two helical structures of the N-terminal 50 amino acids demonstrated by X-ray crystallography to be in complex with D4 (27.Contesto-Richefeu C.

Crystal structure of the vaccinia virus DNA polymerase holoenzyme subunit D4 in complex with the A20 N-terminal domain.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1003978Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the basis of the yeast two-hybrid findings (25.Ishii K. Moss B. Mapping interaction sites of the A20R protein component of the vaccinia virus DNA replication complex.Virology. 2002; 303: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), an N-terminal 63-amino acid truncation of A20 was chosen for this study. Prediction showed that an extra α helix is introduced, compared with the 50-amino acid extension (28.Nuth M. Guan H. Zhukovskaya N. Saw Y.L. Ricciardi R.P. Design of potent poxvirus inhibitors of the heterodimeric processivity factor required for viral replication.J. Med. Chem. 2013; 56: 3235-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), that may further contribute to protein-protein interactions. Fusing the N-terminal 63 amino acids to the maltose binding protein (MBP-A201–63) permitted the expression of sufficient quantities of soluble product (Fig. 1A). Significantly, the requirement of MBP as a carrier protein was demonstrated by the inability to express soluble N-terminal regions of A20 up to 100 amino acids in the absence of MBP in both bacteria and baculovirus (Fig. 1, B and C). We initially interrogated the binding of D4 to A20 by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) because the solved crystal structure and studies by column chromatography (27.Contesto-Richefeu C.

However, we routinely observed protein precipitation during ITC experiments (data not shown). Therefore, an adsorption method, such as SPR, was chosen as an effective alternative to ITC. As the ligand, D4 was prepared with either an N- or C-terminal His6 tag to permit capture onto a CM5 biosensor chip cross-linked with anti-His antibody. The rationale was that, when the D4-A20 heterodimer assembles, aggregates that might otherwise serve as seeds for protein precipitation would be incapable of forming because of the separation of nearby heterodimers by virtue of attachment to the cross-linked antibody under a constant buffer flow. The N- or C-terminal tagged protein, His6D4 or D4His6, respectively, was captured onto the active cell using dilute protein preparations (2 μg/ml) in the presence of 25% (w/v) glycerol. The binding experiments were then performed in running buffer lacking glycerol and with added BSA to minimize nonspecific interactions. As demonstrated by the negligible response to captured His6D4, the injections of up to 20 μm purified MBP served as a negative control (Fig. 2A). By comparison, there was pronounced protein binding with the injections of up to 5 μm MBP-A201–63 (Fig. 2A). Specifically, we found improved curve fitting when constrained to the local response Rmax as opposed to global Rmax. This was likely due to non-uniform ligand captures between replicates. The observed 3-fold increase in affinity for captured D4His6 (KD = 0.07 μm) over His6D4 (KD = 0.21 μm) was imparted by the apparent slower dissociation of the D4His6-A20 heterodimer (Fig. 2). In a reciprocal experiment, MBP-A201–63 was captured by cross-linked anti-MBP antibody and injected with D4 proteins. In this case, the sensograms showed non-first-order behavior and, therefore, did not permit data fitting (data not shown), which would be supportive of heterogeneity of D4 proteins. This indicated that D4 should be used as the ligand in subsequent experiments. Notably, these SPR results demonstrated that the binding of A20 to D4 varied by the positioning of the His6 tag. Next, we sought to understand the D4-A20 interaction in greater detail by examining its binding thermodynamics by SPR. When measured up to 35 °C, it was noticed that the sensograms for both captured D4 protein versions showed a poor fit (data not shown), an attribute commonly associated with gross structural change. Therefore, data collections from 10–30 °C were used. For both captured D4 versions, a linear van 't Hoff fit was established at 10–25 °C, giving rise to favorable entropy (TΔS = 11.93 and 7.24 kcal/mol for His6D4 and D4His6, respectively), whereas nonlinearity was demonstrated when analyzed up to 30 °C (Fig. 2, C and E). To ensure that the observed difference in the SPR studies was not due to disruption of the protein fold by the tag placement, D4 proteins were examined by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, the spectra of all three protein versions showed comparable far-UV traces with extracted secondary structure contents in agreement with the reported crystal structures (24.Schormann N. Grigorian A. Samal A. Krishnan R. DeLucas L. Chattopadhyay D. Crystal structure of vaccinia virus uracil-DNA glycosylase reveals dimeric assembly.BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). D4His6 in particular showed a slight decrease in near-UV absorbance, suggesting a potential environment of the aromatic residues to be different from that of either untagged D4 or His6D4 (Fig. 3A). The protein environment was further examined by 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy. Because untagged D4 was generated from the same 15N-labeled His6D4 preparation, this permitted a reasonable comparison of the D4 proteins differing only in the tag status. It is worth mentioning that 15N-labeled D4His6 was not amenable to NMR studies because of low protein expression in minimal medium and the tendency to precipitate when concentrated, thus providing anecdotal evidence of protein instability when the tag was introduced at the C terminus. 3M. Nuth, unpublished observation. Unlike the solved crystal structures (24.Schormann N. Grigorian A. Samal A. Krishnan R. DeLucas L. Chattopadhyay D.

Crystal structure of the vaccinia virus DNA polymerase holoenzyme subunit D4 in complex with the A20 N-terminal domain.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1003978Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), both untagged D4 and His6D4 proteins showed fewer than expected numbers of amide HN cross-peaks for a 218-amino acid protein and exhibited poor dispersion at 1H chemical shifts (6.5–7.5 ppm; Fig. 3, B and C). Significantly, the impact of the tag was demonstrated by the reduction of peaks for His6D4 (Fig. 3C) compared with untagged D4 (Fig. 3B). Overall, although the CD results showed no evidence of disruption of the protein fold by either tag placement, the NMR studies suggested a difference in protein environment between the tagged and untagged proteins. To corroborate the NMR results, the impact of the tag on protein stability was further examined by measuring soluble protein fractions after 2-h incubation at room temperature (30, 37, and 42 °C). In general, protein instability was observed with the introduction of the His6 tag. For example, ∼50% of untagged D4 protein precipitated at 37 °C, whereas <10% of His6D4 and D4His6 remained soluble (Fig. 3D). Specifically, the impact of the C-terminal His6 tag was evident from the significant protein precipitation at 30 and 37 °C compared with either His6D4 or untagged D4 (Fig. 3D). At 42 °C, all protein versions failed to stay in solution (Fig. 3D). Taken together, the CD results showed that the His6 tag at either the N or C terminus did not disrupt the protein fold, thus providing support for the hypothesis that the proteins used in the SPR experiments were not structurally impaired. However, the NMR and stability studies consistently demonstrated the impact of the His6 tag on protein properties, with the C terminus seemingly susceptible to perturbation on the basis of the stability results. Prior to revealing its essential role in processive DNA synthesis, VACV D4 was discovered to harbor UDG activity (15.Upton C. Stuart D.T. McFadden G.

It was designed to fold into an amphiphilic alpha helical structure of nanoscale length with one hydrophobic face and one fluorinated face. The formation of a fluorous interface serves as the main vector for the formation of a superstructure in a bilayer membrane. Fluorescence assays showed this ion channel's ability to facilitate the translocation of alkali metal ions through a phospholipid membrane, with selectivity for sodium ions. Computational studies showed that a tetramer structure is the most probable and stable supramolecular assembly for the active ion channel structure. The results illustrate the possibility of exploiting multiple Fδ-:M+ interactions for ion transport and using fluorous interfaces to create functional nanostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2551074812,"Serum uric acid (UA) elevation is common in patients with cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases. However, no study to date has analysed the role of UA in Fabry disease (FD).To evaluate the association between serum UA levels and mortality and morbidity in FD.We conducted a post-hoc analysis of a prospectively followed-up cohort of 124 patients with genetically proven FD. Serum UA levels were acquired at baseline; clinical events and mortality were assessed during regular visits every 6 to 12 months. The primary endpoint was a composite of multiple secondary outcomes: all-cause mortality, adverse cardiovascular events, progression of renal dysfunction and stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Predictive value was assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model and the Kaplan Meyer estimator.During follow-up of 7.4 ± 3.7 years, 64 (52%) patients reached the primary combined endpoint. Overall, UA levels were significantly associated with combined outcome (p < 0.001) and remained independently associated after correcting for age, sex and estimated glomerular filtration rate (hazard ratio [HR] per 20 μmol/l increase 1.09, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] (1.00-1.19), p = 0.04). UA was associated with overall mortality in univariate analysis (p = 0.021); however, the association did not reach statistical significance after multivariate correction (HR per 20 μmol/l increase 1.07 95%CI 0.93-1.25, p = 0.32). Higher UA levels were also associated with cardiac adverse outcomes, progression of left ventricular hypertrophy and progression of renal dysfunction (ps < 0.001). No association was observed between UA levels and stroke or TIA (p = 0.323).Increased serum UA levels may represent an independent risk factor for adverse clinical outcomes in Fabry patients and are associated with all-cause mortality. UA is a widely available and cheap biomarker that may improve risk stratification of Fabry patients in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2551373837,"Little is known about edaphic selection pressures as drivers of contrasting white spruce ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure and diversity in the Canadian boreal forest. We hypothesized that community composition differs among the four sites sampled-nursery, mining site, forest edge, and natural forest. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community structure and diversity was studied at the four locations with soil fertility gradient through morpho-molecular and phylogenetic analyses in relationships with rhizospheric soil chemical properties. 41 different species were identified. Mining site had a significantly different species composition than the surrounding environments. Soil pH and percentage of roots colonized by ECM fungi increased while soil P, N, Fe, C, K, Mg, Al, Ca, and Na contents declined across the soil fertility gradient: nursery → natural forest → forest edge → mining site. Contrary to the preference of acid soils by ECM fungi, a few ecologically adapted to high pH, poor soil chemical fertility, and low organic matter content colonize white spruce roots on the non-acidogenic mining site, allowing natural regeneration of white spruce seedlings. Other ECM fungi are adapted to high fertigation level of commercial nursery. This study clearly shows the contrasting difference in white spruce ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure and diversity driven by edaphic selection pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2552321834,"As kidney and brain functions decline with aging, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia are becoming increasing health burdens worldwide. Among the risk factors for cognitive impairment, CKD is increasingly recognized. The precise impact of CKD on the development of cognitive impairment is poorly understood.In the New Tools for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease (NTCVD) cohort, which was recruited in a dedicated nephrology department, we examined the 2-year course of cognitive performance in 120 patients (73 patients with CKD stages 3-5D, 47 control patients without CKD with similar vascular risk profile) using a comprehensive battery of 10 neuropsychological tests.Kidney function, vascular risk factors and cognitive performance were highly stable both in CKD and control patients. The summary score of cognitive performance in CKD patients was very similar at baseline (z = -0.63±0.76) and follow-up (z = -0.54±0.79, p = 0.113), as was cognitive performance in control patients (z = -0.01±0.59 and 0.01±0.70, p = 0.862, at baseline and follow-up, respectively). Total serum cholesterol (199.6±36.0 and 186.0±32.9, p = 0.005 in controls; 194.4±46.1 and 181.2±41.2, p = 0.008 in CKD) and common carotid intima-media thickness (0.87±0.18 and 0.84±0.17, p = 0.351 in controls; 0.88±0.21 and 0.82±0.16, p = 0.002 in CKD) moderately but significantly decreased during the follow-up. In multivariable regression analyses, high age (β = -0.28, 95%CI = -0.48 to 0.08, p = 0.007) predicted decrease in cognitive performance.In this well-defined cohort receiving state-of-the-art therapy, cognitive performance did not decrease over 2 years. Our data emphasize the aspect of risk factor control, suggesting that dedicated medical care might prevent cognitive decline in CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2552255329,"The olfactory system removes correlations in natural odors using a network of inhibitory neurons in the olfactory bulb. It has been proposed that this network integrates the response from all olfactory receptors and inhibits them equally. However, how such global inhibition influences the neural representations of odors is unclear. Here, we study a simple statistical model of the processing in the olfactory bulb, which leads to concentration-invariant, sparse representations of the odor composition. We show that the inhibition strength can be tuned to obtain sparse representations that are still useful to discriminate odors that vary in relative concentration, size, and composition. The model reveals two generic consequences of global inhibition: (i) odors with many molecular species are more difficult to discriminate and (ii) receptor arrays with heterogeneous sensitivities perform badly. Comparing these predictions to experiments will help us to understand the role of global inhibition in shaping normalized odor representations in the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2555285261,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the chromosome region 17q12-q21 are risk factors for asthma. Particularly, there are cis-regulatory haplotypes within this region that regulate differentially the expression levels of ORMDL3, GSDMB and ZPBP2 genes. Remarkably, ORMDL3 has been shown to modulate lymphocyte activation parameters in a heterologous expression system. In this context, it has been shown that Th2 and Th17 cytokine production is affected by SNPs in this region. Therefore, we aim to assess the impact of hereditary components within region 17q12-q21 on the activation profile of human T lymphocytes, focusing on the haplotype formed by allelic variants of SNPs rs7216389 and rs12936231. We measured calcium influx and activation markers, as well as the proliferation rate upon T cell activation. Haplotype-dependent differences in mRNA expression levels of IL-2 and INF-γ were observed at early times after activation. In addition, the allelic variants of these SNPs impacted on the extent of calcium influx in resting lymphocytes and altered proliferation rates in a dose dependent manner. As a result, the asthma risk haplotype carriers showed a lower threshold of saturation during activation. Finally, we confirmed differences in activation marker expression by flow cytometry using phytohemagglutinin, a strong polyclonal stimulus. Altogether, our data suggest that the genetic component of pro-inflammatory pathologies present in this chromosome region could be explained by different T lymphocyte activation dynamics depending on individual allelic heredity."
https://openalex.org/W2554880716,"Hand preference is one of the most apparent functional asymmetry in humans. Under contralateral control, performance is more proficient with the preferred hand; however, the difference between the two hands is greater in right handers, considering left handers generally display less cerebral lateralization. One method of evaluating hand preference is Bishop's card reaching task; however, information regarding validity and sensitivity with children in limited. This study assessed the relationship between Bishop's card reaching task and five hand preference tasks in 8- to 10-year-old typically-developing children from the Czech Republic (N = 376). Structural equation modelling identified a one factor model as the most suitable, including Bishop's card reaching task and three hand preference tasks (ringing, throwing, and rolling with dice). The factor validity (.89) and sensitivity of Bishop's card reaching task (90% to 97%) provided a very good identification of hand preference. These results support the suitability of Bishop's card reaching task as a separate test for determining hand preference in children. Accordingly, we suggest that the assessment of handedness, particularly in neurodevelopmental disorders where the proportion of right-handers and left-handers is disrupted (e.g., children with DCD or ADHD), should make use of Bishop's card reaching task alongside other unimanual tasks."
