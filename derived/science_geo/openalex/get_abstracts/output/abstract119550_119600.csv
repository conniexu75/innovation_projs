https://openalex.org/W2021736444,"Ordered mesostructured porous silicas that are also macroscopically structured were created by control of the interface on two different length scales simultaneously. Micellar arrays controlled the nanometer-scale assembly, and at the static boundary between an aqueous phase and an organic phase, control was achieved on the micrometer to centimeter scale. Acid-prepared mesostructures of silica were made with the p6, Pm3n, and the P63/mmc structures in the form of porous fibers 50 to 1000 micrometers in length, hollow spheres with diameters of 1 to 100 micrometers, and thin sheets up to 10 centimeters in diameter and about 10 to 500 micrometers in thickness. These results might have implications for technical applications, such as slow drug-release systems or membranes, and in biomineralization, where many processes are also interface-controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2151308486,"Cowden disease (CD) (MIM 158350), or multiple hamartoma syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome with a high risk of breast cancer. Its clinical features include a wide array of abnormalities but the main characteristics are hamartomas of the skin, breast, thyroid, oral mucosa and intestinal epithelium. The pathognomonic hamartomatous features of CD include multiple smooth facial papules, acral keratosis and multiple oral papillomas1,2. The pathological hallmark of the facial papules are multiple trichilemmomas3. Expression of the disease is variable and penetrance of the dermatological lesions is assumed to be virtually complete by the age of twenty4. Central nervous system manifestations of CD were emphasized only recently and include megalencephaiy, epilepsy and dysplastic gangliocytomas of the cerebellum (Lhermitte-Duclos disease, LDD)5–7. Early diagnosis is important since female patients with CD are at risk of developing breast cancer. Other lesions include benign and malignant disease of the thyroid, intestinal polyps and genitourinary abnormalities4,8–10. To localize the gene for CD, an autosomal genome scan was performed. A total of 12 families were examined, resulting in a maximum lod score of 8.92 at θ = 0.02 with the marker D10S573 located on chromosome 10q22–23."

https://openalex.org/W2026896701,"The mechanism by which Golgi membrane proteins are retained within the Golgi complex in the midst of a continuous flow of protein and lipid is not yet understood. The diffusional mobilities of mammalian Golgi membrane proteins fused with green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria were measured in living HeLa cells with the fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique. The diffusion coefficients ranged from 3 x 10(-9) square centimeters per second to 5 x 10(-9) square centimeters per second, with greater than 90 percent of the chimeric proteins mobile. Extensive lateral diffusion of the chimeric proteins occurred between Golgi stacks. Thus, the chimeras diffuse rapidly and freely in Golgi membranes, which suggests that Golgi targeting and retention of these molecules does not depend on protein immobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1964973658,"STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription) activate distinct target genes despite having similar DNA binding preferences. The transcriptional specificity of STAT proteins was investigated on natural STAT binding sites near the interferon-gamma gene. These sites are arranged in multiple copies and required cooperative interactions for STAT binding. The conserved amino-terminal domain of STAT proteins was required for cooperative DNA binding, although this domain was not essential for dimerization or binding to a single site. Cooperative binding interactions enabled the STAT proteins to recognize variations of the consensus site. These sites can be specific for the different STAT proteins and may function to direct selective transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2080202671,"alpha2-Adrenergic receptors (alpha2ARs) present in the brainstem decrease blood pressure and are targets for clinically effective antihypertensive drugs. The existence of three alpha2AR subtypes, the lack of subtype-specific ligands, and the cross-reactivity of alpha2AR agonists with imidazoline receptors has precluded an understanding of the role of individual alpha2AR subtypes in the hypotensive response. Gene targeting was used to introduce a point mutation into the alpha2aAR subtype in the mouse genome. The hypotensive response to alpha2AR agonists was lost in the mutant mice, demonstrating that the alpha2aAR subtype plays a principal role in this response."
https://openalex.org/W2084235775,"alpha2-Adrenergic receptors (alpha2ARs) are essential components of the neural circuitry regulating cardiovascular function. The role of specific alpha2AR subtypes (alpha2a, alpha2b, and alpha2c) was characterized with hemodynamic measurements obtained from strains of genetically engineered mice deficient in either alpha2b or alpha2c receptors. Stimulation of alpha2b receptors in vascular smooth muscle produced hypertension and counteracted the clinically beneficial hypotensive effect of stimulating alpha2a receptors in the central nervous system. There were no hemodynamic effects produced by disruption of the alpha2c subtype. These results provide evidence for the clinical efficacy of more subtype-selective alpha2AR drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2060390249,"Cross-linking of the antigen receptor on lymphocytes by antigens or antibodies to the receptor results in activation of enzymes of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the gene encoding the PKC-betaI and PKC-betaII isoforms develop an immunodeficiency characterized by impaired humoral immune responses and reduced cellular responses of B cells, which is similar to X-linked immunodeficiency in mice. Thus PKC-betaI and PKC-betaII play an important role in B cell activation and may be functionally linked to Bruton's tyrosine kinase in antigen receptor-mediated signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2130412866,"Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) commonly causes asymptomatic cutaneous neoplasms in children and sexually active adults as well as persistent opportunistic acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated disease. Sequencing the 190-kilobase pair genome of MCV has now revealed that the virus potentially encodes 163 proteins, of which 103 have homologs in the smallpox virus. MCV lacks counterparts to 83 genes of the smallpox virus, including those important in suppression of host responses to infection, nucleotide biosynthesis, and cell proliferation. MCV possesses 59 genes that are predicted to encode previously uncharacterized proteins, including major histocompatibility complex class I, chemokine, and glutathione peroxidase homologs, which suggests that there are MCV-specific strategies for coexistence with the human host."
https://openalex.org/W2060474677,"The c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated by various heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors, inflammatory cytokines, and stress signals. Yet, upstream mediators that link extracellular signals with the JNK signaling pathway are currently unknown. The tyrosine kinase Pyk2 was activated by tumor necrosis factor alpha, by ultraviolet irradiation, and by changes in osmolarity. Overexpression of Pyk2 led to activation of JNK, and a dominant-negative mutant of Pyk2 interfered with ultraviolet light- or osmotic shock-induced activation of JNK. Pyk2 represents a cell type-specific, stress-sensitive mediator of the JNK signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1997125117,"The recently discovered mesoporous aluminosilicate MCM-41 consists of hexagonal arrays of nanometer-sized cylindrical pores. It is shown that this material can be synthesized by cooperative condensation of silicate and cylindrical cationic micelles. Careful control of the surfactant-water content and the rate of condensation of silica at high alkalinity resulted in hollow tubules 0.3 to 3 micrometers in diameter. The wall of the tubules consisted of coaxial cylindrical pores, nanometers in size, that are characteristic of those of MCM-41. The formation of this higher order structure may take place through a liquid crystal phase transformation mechanism involving an anisotropic membrane-to-tubule phase change. The hierarchical organization of this ""tubules-within-a-tubule"" particle texture is similar to that of the frustules of marine diatoms."

https://openalex.org/W2034043111,"The Argentine Precordillera is a continental fragment rifted from the Ouachita embayment of the southern margin of Laurentia (North America) during Cambrian time [about 515 million years ago (Ma)] and accreted to the western margin of Gondwana (South America) during Ordovician time (about 455 Ma). Similarities of Cambrian stratigraphic successions and faunas, Grenville basement rocks, and dimensions link the Argentine Precordillera to the Ouachita embayment. Evidence of rifting during Cambrian time and of a wide ocean basin during Ordovician time indicates that the Precordillera traveled as an independent microcontinent to collide with Gondwana."

https://openalex.org/W2032839573,"A search was made for 26Mg (26Mg*) from the decay of 26Al (half-life = 0.73 million years) in Al-rich objects from unequilibrated ordinary chondrites. Two Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) and two Al-rich chondrules (not CAIs) were found that contained 26Al when they formed. Internal isochrons for the CAIs yielded an initial 26Al/27Al ratio [(26Al/27Al)0] of 5 x 10(-5), indistinguishable from most CAIs in carbonaceous chondrites. This result shows that CAIs with this level of 26Al are present throughout the classes of chondrites and strengthens the notion that 26Al was widespread in the early solar system. The two Al-rich chondrules have lower 26Mg*, corresponding to a (26Al/27Al)0 ratio of approximately 9 x 10(-6). Five other Al-rich chondrules contain no resolvable 26Mg*. If chondrules and CAIs formed from an isotopically homogeneous reservoir, then the chondrules with 26Al must have formed or been last altered approximately2 million years after CAIs formed; the 26Mg*-free chondrules formed >1 to 3 million years later still. Because 26Mg*-containing and 26Mg*-free chondrules are both found in Chainpur, which was not heated to more than approximately400&deg;C, it follows that parent body metamorphism cannot explain the absence of 26Mg* in some of these chondrules. Rather, its absence indicates that the lifetime of the solar nebula over which CAIs and chondrules formed extended over approximately5 million years."

https://openalex.org/W2002941945,"A 450-year tree-ring width chronology of Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour) growing at timberline (2450 meters) in the Tarvagatay Mountains in west central Mongolia shows wide annual growth rings for the recent century. Ecological site observations and comparisons with instrumental temperature records indicate that the ring widths of these trees are sensitive to annual temperature variations. Low-frequency variations in the Tarvagatay tree-ring record are similar to those in a reconstruction of Arctic annual temperatures, which is based on 20 tree-ring width series from northern North America, Scandinavia, and western Russia. The results indicate that recent warming is unusual relative to temperatures of the past 450 years."
https://openalex.org/W2019318413,"Liver directed gene transfer with adenoviral vectors is being considered for the treatment of several metabolic diseases, including familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Gene replacement therapy of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene into the murine model of FH transiently corrected the dyslipidaemia; however, humoral and cellular immune responses to LDL receptor developed — possibly contributing to the associated hepatitis and extinguishing of transgene expression. We evaluated an alternative strategy of ectopic expression in the liver of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, which is homologous to the LDL receptor but has a different pattern of expression. Infusion of recombinant adenoviruses containing the VLDL receptor gene corrected the dyslipidaemia in the FH mouse and circumvented immune responses to the transgene leading to a more prolonged metabolic correction."

The comparison reveals that the model underestimates by 25 to 30 watts per square meter the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. Contrary to some recent reports, clouds have little or no overall effect on atmospheric absorption, a consistent feature of both the observations and the model. Of several variables considered, water vapor appears to be the dominant influence on atmospheric absorption."

https://openalex.org/W2020031720,"The diphtheria toxin transmembrane (T) domain was spin-labeled at consecutive residues in a helical segment, TH9. After binding of the T domain to membranes at low pH, the nitroxide side chains generated by spin labeling were measured with respect to their frequency of collision with polar and nonpolar reagents. The data showed that the helical structure of TH9 in solution is conserved, with one face exposed to water and the other to the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer. Measurement of the depth of the nitroxide side chains from the membrane surfaces revealed an incremental change of about 5 angstroms per turn, which is consistent with a transmembrane orientation of an alpha helix. These results indicate that the helix forms the lining of a transmembrane water-filled channel."
https://openalex.org/W2094342618,"The preparation and analysis of inorganic-organic polymer nanocomposites consisting of inorganic nanowires and multiwire ""cables"" in a random-coil organic polymer host is reported. Dissolution of inorganic (LiMo3Se3)n wires in a strongly coordinating monomer, vinylene carbonate, and the use of a rapid polymerization in the presence of a cross-linking agent produce nanocomposites without phase separation. Polymerization of dilute solutions yields a material containing mostly (Mo3Se3(-))n mono- and biwires, 6 to 20 angstroms in diameter and 50 to 100 nanometers long. Polymerization of more concentrated liquid crystalline solutions yields a nanocomposite containing oriented multiwire cables, 20 to 40 angstroms in diameter and up to 1500 nanometers long, that display optical anisotropy and electrical conductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2050911090,"In axons, cytoskeletal constituents move by slow transport. However, it remains controversial whether axonal neurofilaments are dynamic structures in which only subunits are transported or whether filaments assemble in the proximal axon and are transported intact as polymers to the axon terminus. To investigate the form neurofilament proteins take during transport, neurons of transgenic mice lacking axonal neurofilaments were infected with a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding epitope-tagged neurofilament M. Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that the virally encoded neurofilament M was transported in unpolymerized form along axonal microtubules. Thus, neurofilament proteins are probably transported as subunits or small oligomers along microtubules, which are major routes for slow axonal transport."
https://openalex.org/W2075447546,"Physiological signaling pathways both diverge and converge-a single neurotransmitter can have multiple effects and multiple transmitters can have the same effects-in the same target cell. Divergence couples the effects of a transmitter together in a relatively fixed ratio. Different physiological circumstances may require a different ratio, however; the coupling must be made modifiable. This can be achieved through convergence. If two transmitters couple the effects in different ratios, then combinations of the transmitters can yield all intermediate ratios of the effects, thus functionally uncoupling them. This mechanism is analyzed in a well-understood, simple invertebrate neuromuscular circuit."

Its thermal decomposition products include disulfur (S2), carbon monosulfide (CS), and (CS)x. The photopolymerization process is accompanied by a large mass-independent isotopic fractionation of sulfur (a 5 to 10 per mil sulfur-33 excess and a 61 to 84 per mil sulfur-36 deficit). Excess sulfur-33 has been observed in several classes of meteorites. Photochemical production of (CS2)x may be important in the origin and evolution of cosmochemical environments such as the presolar nebula, meteorites, asteroids, and planetary atmospheres."
https://openalex.org/W1988334222,"We have analyzed energy dissipation in a digital device (``Single-Electron Parametron'') in which discrete degrees of freedom are used for presenting digital information. If the switching speed is not too high, the device may operate reversibly (adiabatically), and the energy dissipation ${\cal E}$ per bit may be much less than the thermal energy $k_BT$. The energy-time product ${\cal E}\tau $ is, however, much larger than Planck's constant $\hbar $, at least in the standard ``orthodox'' model of single-electron tunneling, which was used in our calculations."

A model consisting of a normally distributed axial dipole component plus an independent isotropic set of vectors with a Maxwellian distribution that simulates secular variation fits the range of geomagnetic fluctuations, in terms of both direction and intensity. This result suggests that the magnitude of secular variation vectors is independent of the magnitude of Earth's axial dipole moment and that the amplitude of secular variation is unchanged during reversals."
