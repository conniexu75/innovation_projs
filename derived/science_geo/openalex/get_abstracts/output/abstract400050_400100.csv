https://openalex.org/W2071051512,"Rod-shaped bacteria elongate by the action of cell wall synthesis complexes linked to underlying dynamic MreB filaments. To understand how the movements of these filaments relate to cell wall synthesis, we characterized the dynamics of MreB and the cell wall elongation machinery using high-precision particle tracking in Bacillus subtilis. We found that MreB and the elongation machinery moved circumferentially around the cell, perpendicular to its length, with nearby synthesis complexes and MreB filaments moving independently in both directions. Inhibition of cell wall synthesis by various methods blocked the movement of MreB. Thus, bacteria elongate by the uncoordinated, circumferential movements of synthetic complexes that insert radial hoops of new peptidoglycan during their transit, possibly driving the motion of the underlying MreB filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2075234068,"The peptidoglycan cell wall and the actin-like MreB cytoskeleton are major determinants of cell shape in rod-shaped bacteria. The prevailing model postulates that helical, membrane-associated MreB filaments organize elongation-specific peptidoglycan-synthesizing complexes along sidewalls. We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize the dynamic relation between MreB isoforms and cell wall synthesis in live Bacillus subtilis cells. During exponential growth, MreB proteins did not form helical structures. Instead, together with other morphogenetic factors, they assembled into discrete patches that moved processively along peripheral tracks perpendicular to the cell axis. Patch motility was largely powered by cell wall synthesis, and MreB polymers restricted diffusion of patch components in the membrane and oriented patch motion."

Zhang and Darnell analyze sites of mutation induced by the crosslinking to map binding at single-nucleotide resolution. Mammalian RNA complexity is regulated through interactions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target transcripts. High-throughput sequencing together with UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) is able to globally map RBP-binding footprint regions at a resolution of ∼30-60 nucleotides. Here we describe a systematic way to analyze HITS-CLIP data to identify exact crosslink sites, and thereby determine protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution. We found that reverse transcriptase used in CLIP frequently skips the crosslinked amino-acid-RNA adduct, resulting in a nucleotide deletion. Genome-wide analysis of these crosslinking-induced mutation sites (CIMS) in HITS-CLIP data for Nova and Argonaute (Ago) proteins in mouse brain tissue revealed deletions in ∼8–20% of mRNA tags, which mapped to Nova and Ago binding sites on mRNA or miRNA. CIMS analysis provides a general and more precise means of mapping protein-RNA interactions than currently available methods and insight into the biochemical properties of such interactions in living tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2081409400,"A quantum fluid passing an obstacle behaves differently from a classical one. When the flow is slow enough, the quantum gas enters a superfluid regime and neither whirlpools nor waves form around the obstacle. For higher flow velocities, it has been predicted that the perturbation induced by the defect gives rise to the turbulent emission of quantised vortices and to the nucleation of solitons. Using an interacting Bose gas of exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity, we report the transition from superfluidity to the hydrodynamic formation of oblique dark solitons and vortex streets in the wake of a potential barrier. The direct observation of these topological excitations provides key information on the mechanisms of superflow and shows the potential of polariton condensates for quantum turbulence studies."
https://openalex.org/W1978014948,"A classical question in philosophy and psychology is if the sense of one's body influences how one visually perceives the world. Several theoreticians have suggested that our own body serves as a fundamental reference in visual perception of sizes and distances, although compelling experimental evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. In contrast, modern textbooks typically explain the perception of object size and distance by the combination of information from different visual cues. Here, we describe full body illusions in which subjects experience the ownership of a doll's body (80 cm or 30 cm) and a giant's body (400 cm) and use these as tools to demonstrate that the size of one's sensed own body directly influences the perception of object size and distance. These effects were quantified in ten separate experiments with complementary verbal, questionnaire, manual, walking, and physiological measures. When participants experienced the tiny body as their own, they perceived objects to be larger and farther away, and when they experienced the large-body illusion, they perceived objects to be smaller and nearer. Importantly, despite identical retinal input, this ""body size effect"" was greater when the participants experienced a sense of ownership of the artificial bodies compared to a control condition in which ownership was disrupted. These findings are fundamentally important as they suggest a causal relationship between the representations of body space and external space. Thus, our own body size affects how we perceive the world."

https://openalex.org/W2111719469,"A small number of blind people are adept at echolocating silent objects simply by producing mouth clicks and listening to the returning echoes. Yet the neural architecture underlying this type of aid-free human echolocation has not been investigated. To tackle this question, we recruited echolocation experts, one early- and one late-blind, and measured functional brain activity in each of them while they listened to their own echolocation sounds.When we compared brain activity for sounds that contained both clicks and the returning echoes with brain activity for control sounds that did not contain the echoes, but were otherwise acoustically matched, we found activity in calcarine cortex in both individuals. Importantly, for the same comparison, we did not observe a difference in activity in auditory cortex. In the early-blind, but not the late-blind participant, we also found that the calcarine activity was greater for echoes reflected from surfaces located in contralateral space. Finally, in both individuals, we found activation in middle temporal and nearby cortical regions when they listened to echoes reflected from moving targets.These findings suggest that processing of click-echoes recruits brain regions typically devoted to vision rather than audition in both early and late blind echolocation experts."
https://openalex.org/W2166075081,Electrons in artificial lattices enable explorations of the impact of repulsive Coulomb interactions in a tunable system. We have trapped two-dimensional electrons belonging to a gallium arsenide quantum well in a nanofabricated lattice with honeycomb geometry. We probe the excitation spectrum in a magnetic field identifying novel collective modes that emerge from the Coulomb interaction in the artificial lattice as predicted by the Mott-Hubbard model. These observations allow us to determine the Hubbard gap and suggest the existence of a novel Coulomb-driven ground state. This approach offers new venues for the study of quantum phenomena in a controllable solid-state system.

https://openalex.org/W2086387774,"The intestinal microbiota is composed of hundreds of species of bacteria, fungi and protozoa and is critical for numerous biological processes, such as nutrient acquisition, vitamin production, and colonization resistance against bacterial pathogens. We studied the role of the intestinal microbiota on host resistance to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-induced colitis. Using multiple antibiotic treatments in 129S1/SvImJ mice, we showed that disruption of the intestinal microbiota alters host susceptibility to infection. Although all antibiotic treatments caused similar increases in pathogen colonization, the development of enterocolitis was seen only when streptomycin or vancomycin was used; no significant pathology was observed with the use of metronidazole. Interestingly, metronidazole-treated and infected C57BL/6 mice developed severe pathology. We hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infectious colitis without affecting the ability of S. Typhimurium to colonize the intestine. Indeed, different antibiotic treatments caused distinct shifts in the intestinal microbiota prior to infection. Through fluorescence in situ hybridization, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and real-time PCR, we showed that there is a strong correlation between the intestinal microbiota composition before infection and susceptibility to Salmonella-induced colitis. Members of the Bacteroidetes phylum were present at significantly higher levels in mice resistant to colitis. Further analysis revealed that Porphyromonadaceae levels were also increased in these mice. Conversely, there was a positive correlation between the abundance of Lactobacillus sp. and predisposition to colitis. Our data suggests that different members of the microbiota might be associated with S. Typhimurium colonization and colitis. Dissecting the mechanisms involved in resistance to infection and inflammation will be critical for the development of therapeutic and preventative measures against enteric pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2135238509,"Immune adaptation is a critical component of successful pregnancy. Of primary importance is the modification of cytokine production upon immune activation. With the discovery that normal pregnancy itself is a pro-inflammatory state, it was recognised that the classical Th1/Th2 cytokine paradigm, with a shift towards ‘type 2’ cytokine production (important for antibody production), and away from ‘type 1’ immunity (associated with cell mediated immunity and graft rejection), is too simplistic. It is now generally agreed that both arms of cytokine immunity are activated, but with a bias towards ‘type 2’ immunity. Many factors are released from the placenta that can influence the maternal cytokine balance. Here we focus on syncytiotrophoblast microvesicles (STBM) which are shed from the placenta into the maternal circulation. We show that STBM can bind to monocytes and B cells and induce cytokine release (TNFα, MIP-1α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8). Other cytokines are down-modulated, such as IP-10 which is associated with ‘type 1’ immunity. Therefore STBM may aid the ‘type 2’ skewed nature of normal pregnancy. We also observed that PBMC from third trimester normal pregnant women produce more TNFα and IL-6 in response to STBM than PBMC from non-pregnant women, confirming that maternal immune cells are primed by pregnancy, possibly through their interaction with STBM."

https://openalex.org/W1977579291,"Chemotherapy is a critical component of malaria control. However, the most deadly malaria pathogen, Plasmodium falciparum, has repeatedly mounted resistance against a series of antimalarial drugs used in the last decades. Southeast Asia is an epicenter of emerging antimalarial drug resistance, including recent resistance to the artemisinins, the core component of all recommended antimalarial combination therapies. Alterations in the parasitic membrane proteins Pgh-1, PfCRT and PfMRP1 are believed to be major contributors to resistance through decreasing intracellular drug accumulation. The pfcrt, pfmdr1 and pfmrp1 genes were sequenced from a set of P.falciparum field isolates from the Thai-Myanmar border. In vitro drug susceptibility to artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, mefloquine and lumefantrine were assessed. Positive correlations were seen between the in vitro susceptibility responses to artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin and the responses to the arylamino-alcohol quinolines lumefantrine and mefloquine. The previously unstudied pfmdr1 F1226Y and pfmrp1 F1390I SNPs were associated significantly with artemisinin, mefloquine and lumefantrine in vitro susceptibility. A variation in pfmdr1 gene copy number was also associated with parasite drug susceptibility of artemisinin, mefloquine and lumefantrine. Our work unveils new candidate markers of P. falciparum multidrug resistance in vitro, while contributing to the understanding of subjacent genetic complexity, essential for future evidence-based drug policy decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2166719014,"Background Corals worldwide are in decline due to climate change effects (e.g., rising seawater temperatures), pollution, and exploitation. The ability of corals to cope with these stressors in the long run depends on the evolvability of the underlying genetic networks and proteins, which remain largely unknown. A genome-wide scan for positively selected genes between related coral species can help to narrow down the search space considerably. Methodology/Principal Findings We screened a set of 2,604 putative orthologs from EST-based sequence datasets of the coral species Acropora millepora and Acropora palmata to determine the fraction and identity of proteins that may experience adaptive evolution. 7% of the orthologs show elevated rates of evolution. Taxonomically-restricted (i.e. lineage-specific) genes show a positive selection signature more frequently than genes that are found across many animal phyla. The class of proteins that displayed elevated evolutionary rates was significantly enriched for proteins involved in immunity and defense, reproduction, and sensory perception. We also found elevated rates of evolution in several other functional groups such as management of membrane vesicles, transmembrane transport of ions and organic molecules, cell adhesion, and oxidative stress response. Proteins in these processes might be related to the endosymbiotic relationship corals maintain with dinoflagellates in the genus Symbiodinium. Conclusion/Relevance This study provides a birds-eye view of the processes potentially underlying coral adaptation, which will serve as a foundation for future work to elucidate the rates, patterns, and mechanisms of corals' evolutionary response to global climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2000485363,"Cysteine (C)-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), the primary receptor for stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), is involved in bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2)-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors. To target the in vivo function of CXCR4 in bone and explore the underlying mechanisms, we conditionally inactivated CXCR4 in osteoprecursors by crossing osterix (Osx)-Cre mice with floxed CXCR4 (CXCR4(fl/fl)) mice to generate knock-outs with CXCR4 deletion driven by the Osx promoter (Osx::CXCR4(fl/fl)). The Cre-mediated excision of CXCR4 occurred exclusively in bone of Osx::CXCR4(fl/fl) mice. When compared with littermate controls, Osx::CXCR4(fl/fl) mice developed smaller osteopenic skeletons as evidenced by reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass, lower bone mineral density, and a slower mineral apposition rate. In addition, Osx::CXCR4(fl/fl) mice displayed chondrocyte disorganization in the epiphyseal growth plate associated with decreased proliferation and collagen matrix syntheses. Moreover, mature osteoblast-related expression of type I collagen α1 and osteocalcin was reduced in bone of Osx::CXCR4(fl/fl) mice versus controls, suggesting that CXCR4 deficiency results in arrested osteoblast progression. Primary cultures for osteoblastic cells derived from Osx::CXCR4(fl/fl) mice also showed decreased proliferation and impaired osteoblast differentiation in response to BMP2 or BMP6 stimulation, and suppressed activation of intracellular BMP receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) and Erk1/2 was identified in CXCR4-deficient cells and bone tissues. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that CXCR4 functions in postnatal bone development by regulating osteoblast development in cooperation with BMP signaling. Thus, CXCR4 acts as an endogenous signaling component necessary for bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2142030561,"Leishmania parasites proliferate within nutritionally complex niches in their sandfly vector and mammalian hosts. However, the extent to which these parasites utilize different carbon sources remains poorly defined. In this study, we have followed the incorporation of various 13C-labeled carbon sources into the intracellular and secreted metabolites of Leishmania mexicana promastigotes using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 13C NMR. [U-13C]Glucose was rapidly incorporated into intermediates in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the cytoplasmic carbohydrate reserve material, mannogen. Enzymes involved in the upper glycolytic pathway are sequestered within glycosomes, and the ATP and NAD+ consumed by these reactions were primarily regenerated by the fermentation of phosphoenolpyruvate to succinate (glycosomal succinate fermentation). The initiating enzyme in this pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, was exclusively localized to the glycosome. Although some of the glycosomal succinate was secreted, most of the C4 dicarboxylic acids generated during succinate fermentation were further catabolized in the TCA cycle. A high rate of TCA cycle anaplerosis was further suggested by measurement of [U-13C]aspartate and [U-13C]alanine uptake and catabolism. TCA cycle anaplerosis is apparently needed to sustain glutamate production under standard culture conditions. Specifically, inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase with sodium fluoroacetate resulted in the rapid depletion of intracellular glutamate pools and growth arrest. Addition of high concentrations of exogenous glutamate alleviated this growth arrest. These findings suggest that glycosomal and mitochondrial metabolism in Leishmania promastigotes is tightly coupled and that, in contrast to the situation in some other trypanosomatid parasites, the TCA cycle has crucial anabolic functions.

Leishmania spp. are parasitic protozoa that cause a spectrum of disease in humans, ranging from self-limiting cutaneous infections to disseminating infections (mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis) that can lead to severe morbidity and death (1Murray H.W.

Approximately 12 million people are infected worldwide, resulting in more than 50,000 deaths each year (2Croft S.L. Sundar S. Fairlamb A.H. Clin. Microbiol.

There are no vaccines against any of these diseases, and current drug therapies are both limited and, in many cases, are being undermined by widespread resistance (2Croft S.L. Sundar S. Fairlamb A.H.

Although the genomes of several Leishmania species have now been sequenced and key aspects of metabolism intensively studied, major gaps exist in our understanding of central carbon metabolism in these divergent eukaryotes (3Opperdoes F.R.

Leishmania develop as extracellular flagellated promastigote stages within the digestive tract of the sandfly vector. This stage is transmitted to the mammalian host when the female sandfly host takes a blood meal and is rapidly phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages (1Murray H.W. Berman J.D. Davies C.R. Saravia N.G. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1561-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Promastigotes internalized into the phagolysosome compartment of macrophages differentiate into the obligate intracellular amastigote stage that perpetuates infection in the mammalian host. Promastigote stages are readily cultivated in vitro and have been the focus of most metabolic studies. Like the intensively studied insect (procyclic) stage of the related trypanosomatid, Trypanosoma brucei (7Bringaud F. Rivière L. Coustou V. Mol. Biochem.

Acta. 2006; 1763: 1463-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The glycosomal catabolism of glucose to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate requires an investment of both ATP and NAD+, and the rate at which these cofactors are regenerated within the closed glycosomal compartment is thought to play a key role in regulating glycolytic flux (Fig. 1) (10Michels P.A.

Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In T. brucei procyclic stages, glycosomal pools of ATP and NAD+ can be regenerated by import of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate and its conversion to succinate via the enzymes PEP 2The abbreviations used are: PEPphosphoenolpyruvateCDMcompletely defined mediaNaFAcsodium fluoroacetate. carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and NADH-dependent fumarate reductase (Fig. 1). This pathway, referred to as glycosomal succinate fermentation, results in the synthesis of one ATP and two molecules of NAD+ for each PEP imported. However, other pathways for regenerating glycosomal ATP and NAD+ have also been identified. These include a glycerol 3-phosphate/dihydroxyacetone shuttle and reactions catalyzed by a glycerol-3-phosphate kinase, glycosomal isoforms of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and/or a pyruvate dikinase (10Michels P.A. Bringaud F. Herman M. Hannaert V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1463-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In T. brucei procyclic stages, succinate fermentation appears to the major pathway for regenerating glycosomal pools of ATP/NAD+, although other pathways may be activated if succinate fermentation is inhibited (12Ebikeme C.

MacKenzie N.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we have significantly expanded this approach by using multiple 13C-labeled carbon sources and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to increase the number and range of intracellular metabolites detected. Using this approach, we have mapped the major pathways of carbon metabolism in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes under glucose-replete conditions. Our results provide direct evidence for the operation of a complete TCA cycle in Leishmania promastigotes. Unexpectedly, we find that C4 dicarboxylic acids generated by both succinate glycosomal fermentation and the uptake and deamination of aspartate contribute to a high rate of TCA cycle anaplerosis. The replenishment of TCA cycle intermediates is needed to sustain the cataplerotic synthesis of glutamate and biosynthetically related amino acids (proline and glutamine) under physiological conditions. These findings reveal new functions for both succinate fermentation and the TCA cycle in trypanosomatid parasites. They also highlight the utility of stable isotope tracing and metabolomic approaches for identifying stage- and species-specific differences in the metabolic networks in these parasites. L. mexicana wild type (WT) (MNYC/BZ/62/M379) promastigotes were cultured in M199 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Parasites were passaged twice weekly (1:100 and 1:1000 dilutions) into fresh media to maintain log phase growth. Mid-log phase promastigotes (1 × 107 cell/ml) were harvested 2 days after inoculation of the media. Sodium fluoroacetate was used at 5 mm in growth experiments and 0.5 mm in [U-13C]glucose labeling experiments. For 13C metabolic labeling experiments, log phase promastigotes were resuspended (2 × 107 cells/ml) in completely defined media (CDM) containing various 13C-labeled carbon sources. CDM has the following composition: glucose (6 mm), alanine (1.9 mm), arginine (0.4 mm), glycine (3.1 mm), histidine (0.04 mm), isoleucine (0.045 mm), leucine (0.61 mm), lysine (0.55 mm), methionine (0.13 mm), phenylalanine (0.18 mm), proline (0.26 mm), serine (0.76 mm), threonine (0.34 mm), tyrosine (0.033 mm), valine (1.1 mm), and tryptophan (0.15 mm), vitamins, heme, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing bound fatty acids (32Merlen T. Sereno D. Brajon N. Rostand F. Lemesre J.L. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 60: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the labeling studies, unlabeled components were replaced with the following U-13C-labeled carbon sources (Cambridge Stable Isotopes): [U-13C]glucose (6 mm), [U-13C]alanine (1.5 mm), [U-13C]aspartate (1.5 mm), [U-13C]glutamine (1.5 mm), [U-13C]glutamate (1.5 mm), [U-13C]proline (0.26 mm), NaH13CO3 (1 mg/ml), or [U-13C]acetate (0.12 mm). For labeling experiments with [U-13C]fatty acids, a mixture of [U-13C]fatty acids (Cambridge Stable Isotopes) was bound to delipidated bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1:1 molar ratio), filter-sterilized, and added to CDM at 0.5–2% (w/v). Parasite metabolism was quenched using the protocol described previously (33De Souza D.P. Saunders E.C. McConville M.J. Likiæ V.A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of promastigote culture medium (containing 12 × 107 parasites) were transferred to 15-ml tubes and rapidly chilled in a dry ice/ethanol slurry (∼10 s to cool the cell suspension to 0 °C). The tubes were transferred to an ice bath, just before the suspension reached 0 °C (to prevent freezing), and the chilled parasites were harvested by centrifugation (805 × g, 10 min, 0 °C). The culture supernatant was stored at −70 °C for NMR analysis, and the cell pellet was suspended in ice-cold PBS (3 ml, 0 °C), and 4 × 107 cell eq (three replicates) were washed twice with cold PBS (10,000 × g, 1 min at 0 °C) and immediately extracted in chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1 v/v, 250 μl) containing 1 nmol of scyllo-inositol as an internal standard. The extracts were vortex-mixed and then incubated at 60 °C for 15 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (16,100 × g, 0 °C, 5 min), and the supernatant was adjusted to chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:3 v/v) by addition of H2O, vortex-mixed, and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 5 min) to induce phase separation. The lower phase was retained for lipid analysis, and the upper phase was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) for analysis of polar metabolites. Polar phases were dried in vacuo (55 °C) in 250-μl glass GC vial inserts, and free aldehyde groups were protected by derivatization in methoxyamine hydrochloride (Sigma, 20 μl, 20 mg/ml in pyridine) with continuous mixing (25 °C, 14 h) (33De Souza D.P. Saunders E.C. McConville M.J. Likiæ V.A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Metabolites were subsequently derivatized with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide reagent (containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane (Pierce, 20 μl) for 1 h at 25 °C. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS using a DB5 capillary column (J&W Scientific, 30 m, 250 μm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness), with a 10-m inert duraguard. The injector insert and GC-MS transfer line temperatures were 270 and 250 °C, respectively. The oven temperature gradient was programmed as follows: 70 °C (1 min); 70 °C to 295 °C at 12.5 °C/min; 295 °C to 320 °C at 25 °C/min; 320 °C for 2 min. The major carbohydrate reserve material of promastigotes, mannogen, was extracted and subjected to solvolysis in anhydrous methanolic HCl (50 μl, 0.5 m HCl, 16 h, 80 °C), and the N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide derivative of mannose methyl esters was determined by GC-MS (34Ralton J.E.

Metabolites were identified based on GC retention time and mass spectra as compared with authentic standards. The level of labeling was estimated as the percent of the metabolite pool containing one or more 13C atoms. The mass isotopomer distributions of individual metabolites were corrected for the occurrence of natural isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and silicon in both the metabolite and derivatizing agent as described previously (35Zamboni N. Fendt S.M. Rühl M. Sauer U. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 878-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants (540 μl) were gently premixed with 5 mm D6-DSS in D2O (60 μl, containing 0.2% w/v NaN3), 21.4 mm [U-13C]glycerol in D2O (5 μl, containing 0.2% w/v NaN3), and 21.4 mm imidazole in D2O (5 μl, containing 0.2% w/v NaN3), prior to analysis by NMR. 13C spectra at 200 MHz were obtained using an 800 MHz Bruker-Biospin Avance fitted with a cryoprobe. Samples were maintained at 25 °C and spun at 20 Hz during sample collection. 13C spectra were acquired using the Avance zgpg pulse program with power-gated 1H decoupling. A pre-scan delay of 80.78 μs, a delay between pulses of 2.0 s, and an acquisition time of 0.78 s were used. For each sample, four dummy scans were followed by 4000 scans with a receiver gain set at 2050. The resulting 13C free induction decays were processed with Bruker TOPSPIN 2.0 (the exponential function with line broadening = 5.0 Hz was applied in the frequency domain prior to Fourier transform, base-line correction, and integration). Quantification was performed as published previously (36Lutz N.W. Yahi N. Fantini J. Cozzone P.J. Magn. Reson. Med. 1996; 36: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and spectra were assigned by reference to authentic standards. The open reading frame of PEP carboxykinase (LmjF27.1810) was amplified by PCR using primers CTAGCGGCCGCggagctggtgcaggcgctggagccggtgccatggccccgatcatccaccg and GCTGGATCCctacagatgagccgtctccac and cloned into the NotI/BamHI sites of pXG GFP2+. For the deletion of the C-terminal tripeptide AHL, the reverse primer GCTGGATCCctacgtctccacgtacttcggcac was used instead. Clones were verified by diagnostic digests and sequencing of the entire open reading frame. Promastigotes were subsequently transfected with purified plasmids by electroporation and selected with G418 (50 μg/ml) (6Naderer T. Heng J. McConville M.J. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001245Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GFP-expressing parasites were immobilized onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope). Images were compiled in Photoshop (6Naderer T. Heng J. McConville M.J. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001245Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that rapidly dividing Leishmania promastigotes utilize glucose as the preferred carbon source. However, the extent to which other carbon sources are co-utilized remains poorly defined. The uptake and catabolism of [U-13C]glucose and other U-13C-labeled carbon sources in CDM were therefore measured. As expected, rapidly dividing promastigotes preferentially utilized [U-13C]glucose (Fig. 2A), which was catabolized to CO2 (detected as H13CO3− by 13C NMR) and the partially oxidized end products succinate, acetate, and alanine (Fig. 2B). A low level of [13C]glutamate secretion was also observed. These results are consistent with the operation of the succinate fermentation pathway, the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate (via the mitochondrial acetate:succinyl-CoA transferase) and substantial flux of glycolytic end products into the TCA cycle (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, promastigotes also utilized significant amounts of aspartate and alanine under glucose-replete conditions (Fig. 2A). Both amino acids were partially catabolized to CO2 and/or converted to succinate or acetate (Fig. 2B). Some of the internalized aspartate was also secreted as alanine, possibly indicating interconversion of malate and pyruvate via the malic enzyme (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, neither glutamate, glutamine, nor proline were significantly internalized when these amino acids were present in the medium at 300 μm (data not shown). However, a low level of uptake of glutamate and to a lesser extent glutamine was observed when these amino acids were provided at 1.5 mm (Fig. 2, A and B). These data suggest that promastigote glutamate uptake is minimal under standard in vitro cultivation conditions. The uptake of aspartate/alanine appears to be important for normal growth, as promastigote proliferation in medium lacking nonessential amino acids was significantly reduced compared with growth in CDM (supplemental Fig. S1). Promastigotes internalized a range of other essential and nonessential amino acids (supplemental Fig. S2). However, none of these amino acids were actively catabolized to CO2 or other detectable end products under these conditions. Similarly, promastigotes exhibited minimal uptake and utilization of alternative carbon sources, such as [U-13C]acetate or [U-13C]fatty acids (Fig. 3B). Current models of glucose catabolism in Leishmania have been largely inferred from analysis of secreted end products. To more precisely define the metabolic fate of glucose, the labeling of intracellular metabolite pools with [U-13C]glucose was monitored using GC-MS. This method can be used to detect more than 120 metabolites in promastigote extracts, of which 30 were found to be labeled with one or more of the proffered 13C-labeled carbon sources. Label derived from [U-13C]glucose was rapidly incorporated into intermediates in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycosomal succinate fermentation, and the TCA cycle (Fig. 3, A and B). The labeling of intermediates in the glycolytic and succinate fermentation pathway/TCA cycle generally plateaued after 3 h, although a further gradual increase in enrichment occurred over 24 h (Fig. 3A), most likely reflecting the time needed to reach isotopic equilibration with the intracellular carbohydrate reserve, mannogen (see below), and extracellular pools of alanine, which is both secreted and internalized (Fig. 1). The pentose phosphate pathway intermediates, ribose-5-phosphate and sedoheptulose-7-P, were labeled with slower kinetics than the glycolytic intermediates indicating a reduced flux into this pathway. However, the pentose phosphate pathway is likely to be critical for the de novo synthesis of nucleotides needed to maintain NTP levels and RNA/DNA synthesis, as shown by the rapid labeling of the ribose sugar moiety in the purine nucleotides, adenosine and 5-methylthioadenosine (reflecting the utilization of ATP in polyamine biosynthesis), as well as the labeling of the pyrimidine nucleoside base, uracil, in [U-13C] glucose-fed parasites (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S3). [U-13C]Glucose was also incorporated into the major carbohydrate reserve material, mannogen (Fig. 3, A and B). Mannogen is composed of short chains of β1–2-linked mannose (degree of polymerization 4–40 residues) and is exclusively located in the cytosol (34Ralton J.E. Naderer T. Piraino H.L. Bashtannyk T.A.

Short chain mannogen oligomers detected by GC-MS were labeled with similar kinetics to glycolytic intermediates (Fig. 3A) suggesting that excess glucose/fructose 6-phosphate, generated in the glycosome, is exported to the cytoplasm and converted to mannose 6-phosphate and GDP-Man (Fig. 1). Interestingly, incorporation of label into the total mann"

https://openalex.org/W2051095166,"By definition, parasites harm their hosts. However, some forms of parasite-induced alterations increase parasite transmission between hosts, such that manipulated hosts can be considered extensions of the parasite's phenotype. While well accepted in principle, surprisingly few studies have quantified how parasite manipulations alter host performance and survival under field and laboratory conditions.By interfering with limb development, the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae causes particularly severe morphological alterations within amphibian hosts that provide an ideal system to evaluate parasite-induced changes in phenotype. Here, we coupled laboratory performance trials with a capture-mark-recapture study of 1388 Pacific chorus frogs (Pseudacris regilla) to quantify the effects of parasite-induced malformations on host locomotion, foraging, and survival. Malformations, which affected ∼ 50% of metamorphosing frogs in nature, caused dramatic reductions in all measures of organismal function. Malformed frogs exhibited significantly shorter jumping distances (41% reduction), slower swimming speeds (37% reduction), reduced endurance (66% reduction), and lower foraging success relative to infected hosts without malformations. Furthermore, while normal and malformed individuals had comparable survival within predator-free exclosures, deformed frogs in natural populations had 22% lower biweekly survival than normal frogs and rarely recruited to the adult population over a two-year period.Our results highlight the ability of parasites to deeply alter multiple dimensions of host phenotype with important consequences for performance and survival. These patterns were best explained by malformation status, rather than infection per se, helping to decouple the direct and indirect effects of parasitism on host fitness."
https://openalex.org/W1982306734,"Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) and atherosclerosis share common vascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Adipocytokines and CD34+ progenitor cells are associated with the progression and prognosis of atherosclerotic diseases. Their role in AD is not adequately elucidated. Methods and Findings In the present study, we measured in 41 patients with early AD and 37 age- and weight-matched healthy controls blood concentrations of adiponectin and leptin by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay and of CD34+ progenitor cells using flow cytometry. We found significantly lower plasma levels of leptin in AD patients compared with the controls, whereas plasma levels of adiponectin did not show any significant differences (AD vs. control (mean±SD): leptin:8.9±5.6 ng/mL vs.16.3±15.5 ng/mL;P = 0.038; adiponectin:18.5±18.1 µg/mL vs.16.7±8.9 µg/mL;P = 0.641). In contrast, circulating CD34+ cells were significantly upregulated in AD patients (mean absolute cell count±SD:253±51 vs. 203±37; P = 0.02) and showed an inverse correlation with plasma levels of leptin (r = −0.248; P = 0.037). In logistic regression analysis, decreased leptin concentration (P = 0.021) and increased number of CD34+ cells (P = 0.036) were both significantly associated with the presence of AD. According to multifactorial analysis of covariance, leptin serum levels were a significant independent predictor for the number of CD34+ cells (P = 0.002). Conclusions Our findings suggest that low plasma levels of leptin and increased numbers of CD34+ progenitor cells are both associated with AD. In addition, the results of our study provide first evidence that increased leptin plasma levels are associated with a reduced number of CD34+ progenitor cells in AD patients. These findings point towards a combined involvement of leptin and CD34+ progenitor cells in the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, plasma levels of leptin and circulating CD34+ progenitor cells could represent an important molecular link between atherosclerotic diseases and AD. Further studies should clarify the pathophysiological role of both adipocytokines and progenitor cells in AD and possible diagnostic and therapeutic applications."

Ten complete genomes of haloarchaea are now available, providing an opportunity for comparative analysis.We report here the comparative analysis of five newly sequenced haloarchaeal genomes with five previously published ones. Whole genome trees based on protein sequences provide strong support for deep relationships between the ten organisms. Using a soft clustering approach, we identified 887 protein clusters present in all halophiles. Of these core clusters, 112 are not found in any other archaea and therefore constitute the haloarchaeal signature. Four of the halophiles were isolated from water, and four were isolated from soil or sediment. Although there are few habitat-specific clusters, the soil/sediment halophiles tend to have greater capacity for polysaccharide degradation, siderophore synthesis, and cell wall modification. Halorhabdus utahensis and Haloterrigena turkmenica encode over forty glycosyl hydrolases each, and may be capable of breaking down naturally occurring complex carbohydrates. H. utahensis is specialized for growth on carbohydrates and has few amino acid degradation pathways. It uses the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway instead of the oxidative pathway, giving it more flexibility in the metabolism of pentoses.These new genomes expand our understanding of haloarchaeal catabolic pathways, providing a basis for further experimental analysis, especially with regard to carbohydrate metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2003075530,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have listed the potential bioweapon ricin as a Category B Agent. Ricin is a so-called A/B toxin produced by plants and is one of the deadliest molecules known. It is easy to prepare and no curative treatment is available. An immunotherapeutic approach could be of interest to attenuate or neutralise the effects of the toxin. We sought to characterise neutralising monoclonal antibodies against ricin and to develop an effective therapy. For this purpose, mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced against the two chains of ricin toxin (RTA and RTB). Seven mAbs were selected for their capacity to neutralise the cytotoxic effects of ricin in vitro. Three of these, two anti-RTB (RB34 and RB37) and one anti-RTA (RA36), when used in combination improved neutralising capacity in vitro with an IC50 of 31 ng/ml. Passive administration of association of these three mixed mAbs (4.7 µg) protected mice from intranasal challenges with ricin (5 LD50). Among those three antibodies, anti-RTB antibodies protected mice more efficiently than the anti-RTA antibody. The combination of the three antibodies protected mice up to 7.5 hours after ricin challenge. The strong in vivo neutralising capacity of this three mAbs combination makes it potentially useful for immunotherapeutic purposes in the case of ricin poisoning or possibly for prevention."

https://openalex.org/W1990304875,"Social behavior can influence physiological systems dramatically yet the sensory cues responsible are not well understood. Behavior of male African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, in their natural habitat suggests that visual cues from conspecifics contribute significantly to regulation of social behavior. Using a novel paradigm, we asked whether visual cues alone from a larger conspecific male could influence behavior, reproductive physiology and the physiological stress response of a smaller male. Here we show that just seeing a larger, threatening male through a clear barrier can suppress dominant behavior of a smaller male for up to 7 days. Smaller dominant males being “attacked” visually by larger dominant males through a clear barrier also showed physiological changes for up to 3 days, including up-regulation of reproductive- and stress-related gene expression levels and lowered plasma 11-ketotestesterone concentrations as compared to control animals. The smaller males modified their appearance to match that of non-dominant males when exposed to a larger male but they maintained a physiological phenotype similar to that of a dominant male. After 7 days, reproductive- and stress- related gene expression, circulating hormone levels, and gonad size in the smaller males showed no difference from the control group suggesting that the smaller male habituated to the visual intruder. However, the smaller male continued to display subordinate behaviors and assumed the appearance of a subordinate male for a full week despite his dominant male physiology. These data suggest that seeing a larger male alone can regulate the behavior of a smaller male but that ongoing reproductive inhibition depends on additional sensory cues. Perhaps, while experiencing visual social stressors, the smaller male uses an opportunistic strategy, acting like a subordinate male while maintaining the physiology of a dominant male."

Our results show that male koala bellows are highly individualized, and indicate that cues related to vocal tract filtering contribute the most to vocal identity. In addition, we found that male and female koalas habituated to the bellows of a specific male showed a significant dishabituation when they were presented with bellows from a novel male. The significant reduction in behavioural response to a final rehabituation playback shows this was not a chance rebound in response levels. Our findings indicate that male koala bellows are highly individually distinctive and that the identity of male callers is functionally relevant to male and female koalas during the breeding season. We go on to discuss the biological relevance of signalling identity in this species' sexual communication and the potential practical implications of our findings for acoustic monitoring of male population levels."
https://openalex.org/W2048709895,"HERV-K113 and HERV-K115 have been considered to be among the youngest HERVs because they are the only known full-length proviruses that are insertionally polymorphic and maintain the open reading frames of their coding genes. However, recent data suggest that HERV-K113 is at least 800,000 years old, and HERV-K115 even older. A systematic study of HERV-K HML2 members to identify HERVs that may have infected the human genome in the more recent evolutionary past is lacking. Therefore, we sought to determine how recently HERVs were exogenous and infectious by examining sequence variation in the long terminal repeat (LTR) regions of all full-length HERV-K loci. We used the traditional method of inter-LTR comparison to analyze all full length HERV-Ks and determined that two insertions, HERV-K106 and HERV-K116 have no differences between their 5′ and 3′ LTR sequences, suggesting that these insertions were endogenized in the recent evolutionary past. Among these insertions with no sequence differences between their LTR regions, HERV-K106 had the most intact viral sequence structure. Coalescent analysis of HERV-K106 3′ LTR sequences representing 51 ethnically diverse individuals suggests that HERV-K106 integrated into the human germ line approximately 150,000 years ago, after the emergence of anatomically modern humans."
https://openalex.org/W2003154561,"Assembly of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) into cytotoxic oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates is believed to be a major pathologic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and interfering with Aβ aggregation is an important strategy in the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Prior studies have shown that the double N-methylated analogue of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) IAPP-GI, which is a conformationally constrained IAPP analogue mimicking a non-amyloidogenic IAPP conformation, is capable of blocking cytotoxic self-assembly of Aβ. Here we investigate the interaction of IAPP-GI with Aβ40 and Aβ42 using NMR spectroscopy. The most pronounced NMR chemical shift changes were observed for residues 13–20, while residues 7–9, 15–16 as well as the C-terminal half of Aβ - that is both regions of the Aβ sequence that are converted into β-strands in amyloid fibrils - were less accessible to solvent in the presence of IAPP-GI. At the same time, interaction of IAPP-GI with Aβ resulted in a concentration-dependent co-aggregation of Aβ and IAPP-GI that was enhanced for the more aggregation prone Aβ42 peptide. On the basis of the reduced toxicity of the Aβ peptide in the presence of IAPP-GI, our data are consistent with the suggestion that IAPP-GI redirects Aβ into nontoxic “off-pathway” aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1998836233,"Differences in ex vivo cell culture conditions can drastically affect stem cell physiology. We sought to establish an assay for measuring the effects of chemical, environmental, and genetic manipulations on the precision of repair at a single DNA double-strand break (DSB) in pluripotent and somatic human cells. DSBs in mammalian cells are primarily repaired by either homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). For the most part, previous studies of DSB repair in human cells have utilized nonspecific clastogens like ionizing radiation, which are highly nonphysiologic, or assayed repair at randomly integrated reporters. Measuring repair after random integration is potentially confounded by locus-specific effects on the efficiency and precision of repair. We show that the frequency of HR at a single DSB differs up to 20-fold between otherwise isogenic human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) based on the site of the DSB within the genome. To overcome locus-specific effects on DSB repair, we used zinc finger nucleases to efficiently target a DSB repair reporter to a safe-harbor locus in hESCs and a panel of somatic human cell lines. We demonstrate that repair at a targeted DSB is highly precise in hESCs, compared to either the somatic human cells or murine embryonic stem cells. Differentiation of hESCs harboring the targeted reporter into astrocytes reduces both the efficiency and precision of repair. Thus, the phenotype of repair at a single DSB can differ based on either the site of damage within the genome or the stage of cellular differentiation. Our approach to single DSB analysis has broad utility for defining the effects of genetic and environmental modifications on repair precision in pluripotent cells and their differentiated progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2049258132,"Short-term presynaptic inhibition mediated by G protein-coupled receptors involves a direct interaction between G proteins and the vesicle release machinery. Recent studies implicate the C terminus of the vesicle-associated protein SNAP-25 as a molecular binding target of Gβγ that transiently reduces vesicular release. However, it is not known whether SNAP-25 is a target for molecular modifications expressing long-term changes in transmitter release probability.This study utilized two-photon laser scanning microscopy for real-time imaging of action potential-evoked [Ca(2+)] increases, in single Schaffer collateral presynaptic release sites in in vitro hippocampal slices, plus simultaneous recording of Schaffer collateral-evoked synaptic potentials. We used electroporation to infuse small peptides through CA3 cell bodies into presynaptic Schaffer collateral terminals to selectively study the presynaptic effect of scavenging the G-protein Gβγ. We demonstrate here that the C terminus of SNAP-25 is necessary for expression of LTD, but not long-term potentiation (LTP), of synaptic strength. Using type A botulinum toxin (BoNT/A) to enzymatically cleave the 9 amino acid C-terminus of SNAP-25 eliminated the ability of low frequency synaptic stimulation to induce LTD, but not LTP, even if release probability was restored to pre-BoNT/A levels by elevating extracellular [Ca(2+)]. Presynaptic electroporation infusion of the 14-amino acid C-terminus of SNAP-25 (Ct-SNAP-25), to scavenge Gβγ, reduced both the transient presynaptic inhibition produced by the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor stimulation, and LTD. Furthermore, presynaptic infusion of mSIRK, a second, structurally distinct Gβγ scavenging peptide, also blocked the induction of LTD. While Gβγ binds directly to and inhibit voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, imaging of presynaptic [Ca(2+)] with Mg-Green revealed that low-frequency stimulation only transiently reduced presynaptic Ca(2+) influx, an effect not altered by infusion of Ct-SNAP-25.The C-terminus of SNAP-25, which links synaptotagmin I to the SNARE complex, is a binding target for Gβγ necessary for both transient transmitter-mediated presynaptic inhibition, and the induction of presynaptic LTD."
https://openalex.org/W2013528652,"The phylogenetic position and prophage DNA content of the genomes of 142 S. agalactiae (group-B streptococcus, GBS) isolates responsible for bacteremia and meningitis in adults and neonates were studied and compared. The distribution of the invasive isolates between the various serotypes, sequence types (STs) and clonal complexes (CCs) differed significantly between adult and neonatal isolates. Use of the neighbor-net algorithm with the PHI test revealed evidence for recombination in the population studied (PHI, P = 2.01 × 10(-6)), and the recombination-mutation ratio (R/M) was 6:7. Nevertheless, the estimated R/M ratio differed between CCs. Analysis of the prophage DNA regions of the genomes of the isolates assigned 90% of the isolates to five major prophage DNA groups: A to E. The mean number of prophage DNA fragments amplified per isolate varied from 2.6 for the isolates of prophage DNA group E to 4.0 for the isolates of prophage DNA group C. The isolates from adults and neonates with invasive diseases were distributed differently between the various prophage DNA groups (P < 0.00001). Group C prophage DNA fragments were found in 52% of adult invasive isolates, whereas 74% of neonatal invasive isolates had prophage DNA fragments of groups A and B. Differences in prophage DNA content were also found between serotypes, STs and CCs (P < 0.00001). All the ST-1 and CC1 isolates, mostly of serotype V, belonged to the prophage DNA group C, whereas 84% of the ST-17 and CC17 isolates, all of serotype III, belonged to prophage DNA groups A and B. These data indicate that the transduction mechanisms, i.e., gene transfer from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage, underlying genetic recombination in S. agalactiae species, are specific to each intraspecies lineage and population of strains responsible for invasive diseases in adults and neonates."
https://openalex.org/W1979603902,"On water deficit, abscisic acid (ABA) induces stomata closure to reduce water loss by transpiration. To identify Arabidopsis thaliana mutants which transpire less on drought, infrared thermal imaging of leaf temperature has been used to screen for suppressors of an ABA-deficient mutant (aba3-1) cold-leaf phenotype. Three novel mutants, called hot ABA-deficiency suppressor (has), have been identified with hot-leaf phenotypes in the absence of the aba3 mutation. The defective genes imparted no apparent modification to ABA production on water deficit, were inherited recessively and enhanced ABA responses indicating that the proteins encoded are negative regulators of ABA signalling. All three mutants showed ABA-hypersensitive stomata closure and inhibition of root elongation with little modification of growth and development in non-stressed conditions. The has2 mutant also exhibited increased germination inhibition by ABA, while ABA-inducible gene expression was not modified on dehydration, indicating the mutated gene affects early ABA-signalling responses that do not modify transcript levels. In contrast, weak ABA-hypersensitivity relative to mutant developmental phenotypes suggests that HAS3 regulates drought responses by both ABA-dependent and independent pathways. has1 mutant phenotypes were only apparent on stress or ABA treatments, and included reduced water loss on rapid dehydration. The HAS1 locus thus has the required characteristics for a targeted approach to improving resistance to water deficit. In contrast to has2, has1 exhibited only minor changes in susceptibility to Dickeya dadantii despite similar ABA-hypersensitivity, indicating that crosstalk between ABA responses to this pathogen and drought stress can occur through more than one point in the signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2011211267,"Binding of class I MHC molecules (MHCI) to an inhibitory receptor, PIR-B, expressed on B cells and myeloid cells provides constitutive cellular inhibition, thus ensuring peripheral tolerance. Recent unexpected findings pointed to a novel inhibitory role of PIR-B in neurite regeneration through binding to three axonal outgrowth inhibitors of myelin, including Nogo. Thus, it becomes interesting to determine whether the actions of the inhibitory myelin proteins and MHCI could coexist independently or be mutually exclusive as to the PIR-B-mediated immune and neural cell inhibition. Here, we present data supporting the competition of Nogo- and MHCI-mediated inhibition where they coexist. Kinetic analyses of Nogo and MHCI binding to the whole or a part of the recombinant PIR-B ectodomain revealed that PIR-B binds with higher affinity to Nogo than MHCI and that the MHCI binding only occurred with the N-terminal domains of PIR-B, whereas Nogo binding occurred with either the N- or C-terminal ectodomains. Importantly, kinetic tests indicated that the binding to PIR-B of Nogo and MHCI was competitive. Both endogenous and exogenous Nogo intensified the PIR-B-mediated suppression of interleukin-6 release from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated wild-type, but not PIR-B-deficient, cultured mast cells, indicating that PIR-B mediates Nogo-induced inhibition. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism by which PIR-B-mediated regulation is achieved differentially but competitively via MHCI and Nogo in cells of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1981803530,"Myelin formation and maintenance are crucial for the proper function of the CNS and are orchestrated by a plethora of factors including growth factors, extracellular matrix components, metalloproteases and protease inhibitors. Hemopexin (Hx) is a plasma protein with high heme binding affinity, which is also locally produced in the CNS by ependymal cells, neurons and glial cells. We have recently reported that oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the type of cells in the brain that are most susceptible to lack of Hx, as the number of iron-overloaded OLs increases in Hx-null brain, leading to oxidative tissue damage. In the current study, we found that the expression of the Myelin Basic Protein along with the density of myelinated fibers in the basal ganglia and in the motor and somatosensory cortex of Hx-null mice were strongly reduced starting at 2 months and progressively decreased with age. Myelin abnormalities were confirmed by electron microscopy and, at the functional level, resulted in the inability of Hx-null mice to perform efficiently on the Rotarod. It is likely that the poor myelination in the brain of Hx-null mice was a consequence of defective maturation of OLs as we demonstrated that the number of mature OLs was significantly reduced in mutant mice whereas that of precursor cells was normal. Finally, in vitro experiments showed that Hx promotes OL differentiation. Thus, Hx may be considered a novel OL differentiation factor and the modulation of its expression in CNS may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2026970306,"Background Narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) is currently thought to be an autoimmune-mediated disorder in which environmental risk factors make a significant contribution to its development. It was proposed that vitamin D deficiency plays a role in autoimmune diseases. Here we investigated whether NC can be associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level deficiency in patients with NC compared with gender- and age-matched normal controls. Methodology Serum level of 25 (OH)D was determined in 51 European patients with typical NC compared to 55 age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Demographic and clinical data (age at onset, duration and severity of disease at baseline, and treatment intake at time of study) and season of blood sampling were collected to control for confounding variables. Principal Findings Serum 25(OH)D concentration was lower in NC compared to controls (median, 59.45 nmol/l [extreme values 24.05–124.03] vs. 74.73 nmol/l [26.88–167.48] p = 0.0039). Patients with NC had significantly greater vitamin D deficiency (<75 nmol/l) than controls (72.5% vs 50.9%, p = 0.0238). Division into quartiles of the whole sample revealed that the risk of being affected with NC increased with lower 25(OH)D level, with a 5.34 OR [1.65–17.27] for the lowest quartile (p = 0.0051). Further adjustment for BMI did not modify the strength of the association (OR: 3.63, 95% CI = 1.06–12.46, p = 0.0191). No between BMI and 25(OH)D interaction, and no correlation between 25(OH)D level and disease duration or severity or treatment intake were found in NC. Conclusion We found a higher frequency of vitamin D deficiency in NC. Further studies are needed to assess the contribution of hypovitaminosis D to the risk of developing narcolepsy, and to focus on the utility of assessing vitamin D status to correct potential deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2042877184,"Background We recently demonstrated that tyrosine sulfation is an important contributor to monocyte recruitment and retention in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (Psgl-1) is tyrosine-sulfated in mouse monocyte/macrophages and its interaction with P-selectin is important in monocyte recruitment in atherosclerosis. However, whether tyrosine sulfation is required for the P-selectin binding function of mouse Psgl-1 is unknown. Here we test the function of native Psgl-1 expressed in leukocytes lacking endogenous tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) activity. Methodology/Principal Findings Psgl-1 function was assessed by examining P-selectin dependent leukocyte rolling in post-capillary venules of C57BL6 mice transplanted with hematopoietic progenitors from wild type (WT→B6) or Tpst1;Tpst2 double knockout mice (Tpst DKO→B6) which lack TPST activity. We observed that rolling flux fractions were lower and leukocyte rolling velocities were higher in Tpst DKO→B6 venules compared to WT→B6 venules. Similar results were observed on immobilized P-selectin in vitro. Finally, Tpst DKO leukocytes bound less P-selectin than wild type leukocytes despite equivalent surface expression of Psgl-1. Conclusions/Significance These findings provide direct and convincing evidence that tyrosine sulfation is required for optimal function of mouse Psgl-1 in vivo and suggests that tyrosine sulfation of Psgl-1 contributes to the development of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1977289091,"Chemistry text mining tools should be interoperable and adaptable regardless of system-level implementation, installation or even programming issues. We aim to abstract the functionality of these tools from the underlying implementation via reconfigurable workflows for automatically identifying chemical names. To achieve this, we refactored an established named entity recogniser (in the chemistry domain), OSCAR and studied the impact of each component on the net performance. We developed two reconfigurable workflows from OSCAR using an interoperable text mining framework, U-Compare. These workflows can be altered using the drag-&-drop mechanism of the graphical user interface of U-Compare. These workflows also provide a platform to study the relationship between text mining components such as tokenisation and named entity recognition (using maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM) and pattern recognition based classifiers). Results indicate that, for chemistry in particular, eliminating noise generated by tokenisation techniques lead to a slightly better performance than others, in terms of named entity recognition (NER) accuracy. Poor tokenisation translates into poorer input to the classifier components which in turn leads to an increase in Type I or Type II errors, thus, lowering the overall performance. On the Sciborg corpus, the workflow based system, which uses a new tokeniser whilst retaining the same MEMM component, increases the F-score from 82.35% to 84.44%. On the PubMed corpus, it recorded an F-score of 84.84% as against 84.23% by OSCAR."
https://openalex.org/W2071128901,"Many proteins associated with the phenotype microcephaly have been localized to the centrosome or linked to it functionally. All the seven autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) proteins localize at the centrosome. Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II protein PCNT and Seckel syndrome (also characterized by severe microcephaly) protein ATR are also centrosomal proteins. All of the above findings show the importance of centrosomal proteins as the key players in neurogenesis and brain development. However, the exact mechanism as to how the loss-of-function of these proteins leads to microcephaly remains to be elucidated. To gain insight into the function of the most commonly mutated MCPH gene ASPM, we used the yeast two-hybrid technique to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library with an ASPM bait. The analysis identified Angelman syndrome gene product UBE3A as an ASPM interactor. Like ASPM, UBE3A also localizes to the centrosome. The identification of UBE3A as an ASPM interactor is not surprising as more than 80% of Angelman syndrome patients have microcephaly. However, unlike in MCPH, microcephaly is postnatal in Angelman syndrome patients. Our results show that UBE3A is a cell cycle regulated protein and its level peaks in mitosis. The shRNA knockdown of UBE3A in HEK293 cells led to many mitotic abnormalities including chromosome missegregation, abnormal cytokinesis and apoptosis. Thus our study links Angelman syndrome protein UBE3A to ASPM, centrosome and mitosis for the first time. We suggest that a defective chromosome segregation mechanism is responsible for the development of microcephaly in Angelman syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2068452870,"In some bacterial species and photosynthetic cohorts, including algae, the enzyme l,l-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (DapL) (E.C. 2.6.1.83) is involved in the anabolism of the essential amino acid L-lysine. DapL catalyzes the conversion of tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDPA) to l,l-diaminopimelate (l,l-DAP), in one step bypassing the DapD, DapC and DapE enzymatic reactions present in the acyl DAP pathways. Here we present an in vivo and in vitro characterization of the DapL ortholog from the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr-DapL). The in vivo analysis illustrated that the enzyme is able to functionally complement the E. coli dap auxotrophs and was essential for plant development in Arabidopsis. In vitro, the enzyme was able to inter-convert THDPA and l,l-DAP, showing strong substrate specificity. Cr-DapL was dimeric in both solution and when crystallized. The structure of Cr-DapL was solved in its apo form, showing an overall architecture of a α/β protein with each monomer in the dimer adopting a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transferase-like fold in a V-shaped conformation. The active site comprises residues from both monomers in the dimer and shows some rearrangement when compared to the apo-DapL structure from Arabidopsis. Since animals do not possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for the de novo synthesis of the amino acid l-lysine, enzymes involved in this pathway are attractive targets for the development of antibiotics, herbicides and algaecides."
https://openalex.org/W1979287356,"Thyroglobulin (precursor for thyroid hormone synthesis) is a large secreted glycoprotein comprising contiguous region I (multiple type-1 repeating units engaging the first ∼1,191 residues, followed by a ∼245-residue hinge region), regions II-III (multiple type-2 and 3 repeating units, comprising ∼720 residues), and the C-terminal cholinesterase-like (ChEL) domain (∼570 residues). A signal peptide attached to ChEL makes an independent secretory protein that binds to I-II-III, stabilizing it and rescuing the secretion of I-II-III that would otherwise be trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this study, we found that a signal peptide attached to regions II-III also makes for an efficient secretory protein that neither demonstrably interacts nor has its secretion enhanced by the presence of secretory ChEL. By contrast, region I, either with or without the hinge region, cannot be secreted on its own and remains in the ER where it is bound to ER chaperones BiP and GRP94. Whereas ChEL can rescue secretion of I-II-III, it can rescue I-II only very weakly, and region I not at all. Yet, ChEL begins to rescue region I in cells that also co-express secretory II-III. The data suggest that conformational maturation of region I is a limiting step in the thyroglobulin maturation process, and this step is facilitated by the presence of both regions II-III and ChEL. Mutations causing hypothyroidism might induce solely local/regional misfolding or may interfere more globally by impeding interactions between regions that are required for thyroglobulin secretion."

The diversity of the filamin family is increased by alternative splicing of FLN mRNA. These changes in amino acid sequence can affect the binding of other interacting partners. FLNa and FLNb splice variants (var-1), which are widely expressed at low levels, lack 41 amino acids including the C-terminal part of FLNa(19) and the N-terminal part of FLNa(20) (residues 2127–2167) (6van der Flier A.

FLN var-1 binding to various integrins is increased compared with nonspliced filamins (11Lad Y. Kiema T. Jiang P. Pentikäinen O.T. Coles C.H. Campbell I.D. Calderwood D.A. Ylänne J.

Other possible mechanisms include mechanical force-induced exposure of the cryptic binding site on the CD face (17Chen H.S. Kolahi K.S. Mofrad M.R.K. Biophys.

The hinge region H1, which is responsible for the flexibility of FLN dimers, is missing in some FLNb and FLNc splice variants (12van der Flier A. Kuikman I. Kramer D. Geerts D. Kreft M. Takafuta T. Shapiro S.S. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Its absence might therefore affect the orthogonal cross-linking patterns made by FLN. The expression of different FLN splice variants appears to differ according to tissue type. The predominant isoforms in thyroid are FLNb containing H1 and FLNc lacking H1 (ΔH1) (19Xu W. Xie Z. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 1268-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Xie Z. Xu W. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In some cases, localization of FLN is dependent on the alternative splicing, e.g. FLNb ΔH1 is localized at the tips of actin stress fibers in myotubes. This deletion has also been shown to accelerate the differentiation of myoblast cells in myotubes compared with the canonical isoform (12van der Flier A. Kuikman I. Kramer D. Geerts D. Kreft M. Takafuta T. Shapiro S.S. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). There are also two other splice variants found in FLNb, var-2 and var-3, which lack the four C-terminal domains, including the 24th dimerization domain (12van der Flier A. Kuikman I. Kramer D. Geerts D. Kreft M. Takafuta T. Shapiro S.S. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These FLNB-specific transcripts were shown to be cardiac-specific (12van der Flier A. Kuikman I. Kramer D. Geerts D. Kreft M. Takafuta T. Shapiro S.S. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we obtain structural models of the FLNa fragment containing domains 18–21 and its splice variant-1. The FLNa(18–21) model, constructed using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data, shows that the two domain pairs are roughly perpendicular to each others. Structural characterization with NMR shows that FLNa(19) var-1 is largely unstructured. The binding site located in FLNa(19) is abolished in the splice variant. SAXS analysis of the splice variant FLNa(18–21) var-1 shows that it mainly exists as a rather compact form with average dimensions similar to the corresponding nonspliced isoform. Our results also reveal that migfilin binding induces a conformational change in FLNa(18–21) but not in the splice variant. FLNa fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned into modified pGEX vector (GE Healthcare) with a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site.

The purification was done as published previously (11Lad Y. Kiema T. Jiang P. Pentikäinen O.T. Coles C.H. Campbell I.D. Calderwood D.A. Ylänne J.

All the filamin fragments were further purified and analyzed by passing down a Superdex 75 column on an Äkta FPLC system. The identity and purity of the products were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. The β7 integrin (776PLYKSAITTTINP788)-derived peptide for NMR-based binding studies was the non-isotope-labeled Pro776–Pro788 as described previously (21Jiang P. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11055-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All NMR samples were buffered with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.10 or 7.00) containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT (only for proteins with cysteine), and 0.02% sodium azide in 90% H2O and 10% D2O. A water flip-back gradient enhanced heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) pulse sequence was used for protein characterization and protein-ligand studies. The protein backbone dynamics were measured with heteronuclear NOE experiments as described previously (21Jiang P. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11055-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All spectra were recorded at 1H frequencies of 600-, 750-, and 950-MHz instruments. All spectra were referenced to the water proton shift. NMR data processing was carried out with NMRPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Protein unfolding was monitored by measuring the fluorescence of environment sensitive fluorescent dye SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen). A temperature increment 0.5 °C/30 s from 20 °C to 95 °C was applied. Samples contained 10 μm protein and 5× SYPRO Orange dye in total volume of 25 μl. FLNa(18–21) wild-type and variant-1 constructs were analyzed by limited proteolysis with α-chymotrypsin (Sigma). Protease was added to protein in a 1:1000 ratio. Proteolysis reactions were performed in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT at room temperature. Samples were taken after various incubation time intervals and analyzed in 12% SDS-PAGE. For N-terminal sequencing the protein fragments were run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (24Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein bands of interest were then cut out and subjected to N-terminal sequencing using a Procise 494A Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The migfilin peptide (5PEKRVASSVFITLAP19) and the mutant peptide I15E (5PEKRVASSVFETLAP19), used as a negative control, were ordered from EZBiolab (Westfield, IN). The peptides were coupled to NHS-activated SepharoseTM 4 Fast-Flow (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Sepharose was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with 500 μl of the binding buffer. Proteins were then eluted with 10 μl of SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer and run on a SDS-PAGE. The intensities of Coomassie-stained protein bands were evaluated by ImageJ. The affinity constant were estimated as in Ref. 15Lad Y. Jiang P. Ruskamo S. Harburger D.S. Ylänne J. Campbell I.D. Calderwood D.A. J. Biol.

SAXS data were collected at the EMBL beamline X33 at the DORIS III storage ring, DESY (Hamburg, Germany) (25Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P. Round A. Fiedler S. Hermes C. Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: S190-194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The measurements were carried out at 288 K in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT. The concentrations of FLNa fragments were adjusted to 3–6 mg/ml, and fragments and peptides were used in the molar ratio of 1:10. A MAR345 image plate was used, at a sample-detector distance of 2.7 m and wavelength λ = 0.15 nm, covering the momentum transfer range 0.08 < s < 4.9 nm−1 (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ where 2θ is the scattering angle). The data were processed using standard procedures by the program package PRIMUS (43Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Cryst. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2357) Google Scholar). The radius of gyration (Rg) and maximum dimension (Dmax) of the FLNa(18–21) fragment were evaluated using the programs GUNIER and GNOM (26Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2969) Google Scholar). The degree of compactness of both fragments was analyzed using Kratky plots (s2 I(s) versus s). To assess the conformational variability of FLNa splicing variant-1, the ensemble optimization method (EOM) method (27Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) was used; this allows for the coexistence of multiple conformations is solution. 10,000 randomized models of the FLNa(18–21) var-1 with different conformations of the unstructured polypeptide chain (residues 2045–2126) were generated using both random coil and native options in RanCh. The scattering profiles of these randomly generated conformations were compared using program RanCh of the EOM package. The EOM program employs a genetic algorithm to select a small number of representative structures (here we used 20) from the pool such that the average scattering from the selected ensemble fits the experimental data. Multiple runs of EOM were performed, and the results were averaged to provide quantitative information about the flexibility of the protein in solution (in particular, the Rg and Dmax distributions in the selected ensembles). The conformational variability of FLNa(18–21) in the presence of the migfilin peptide was also calculated using the EOM method (27Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) in a similar way to FLNa(18–21) var-1. Residues 2140–2167, which includes the first β-strand of FLNa(20), were assumed to be unstructured. The ab initio envelopes were obtained by averaging 20 independent runs from the bead modeling program GASBOR (34Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys.

Migfilin peptide (5–19) binding to FLNa(18–21) var-1 I2092C and I2203C mutants in 5, 20, 50, 100, and 200 μm concentrations is shown. FLNa(18–21) var-1 I2092C and I2203C mutants binding to migfilin was quantified by protein staining and expressed as filamin binding (in arbitrary units) calculated as the ratio of filamin bound to filamin in the loading control, normalized to maximal filamin binding in each experiment (mean ± S.E. (error bars); n ≥ 4). Background binding is subtracted from the picture. B, binding assays show that the both binding sites at FLNa(19) and FLNa(21) are masked in FLNa(18–21), but migfilin can displace the masking β-strands and bind to FLNa(18–21). Binding is quantified as in A. C, SAXS-based model of FLNa(18–21) with migfilin bound. Right shows FLNa(18–21) before migfilin binding, and left is when migfilin is bound.

The HSQC spectrum of FLNa(18–21) var-1 is very different from that of the canonical isoform (Fig. 2A). The NMR HSQC spectra of domain pairs and the four-domain 18–21 fragment are very similar (Fig. 2), whereas many peaks are missing in the splice variant, even when the 41 deleted residues are taken into account. Some peaks in spectra from the variant were broadened and clustered in the middle of spectrum. Spectra from shorter FLNa fragments, FLNa(19–20) var-1 FLNa(19–21) var-1, and FLNa(20) var-1, were also collected (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S1). Comparison of the spectrum of FLNa(18–21) var-1 with those of the individual domains and FLNa(18–21) showed that peaks from FLNa(19) are missing or changed, whereas those of FLNa(21) mostly retain their positions (Fig. 2C). A heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE experiment further revealed that many residues had increased backbone dynamics (Fig. 2B), suggesting that they arise from largely unstructured regions of the protein. To complement the NMR analysis, biochemical tools were also used to assess the presence of unfolded parts in FLNa(18–21) var-1. Protein thermal stability assays were done using the ThermoFluor method (33Pantoliano M.W. Petrella E.C. Kwasnoski J.D. Lobanov V.S. Myslik J. Graf E. Carver T. Asel E. Springer B.A. Lane P. Salemme F.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2001; 6: 429-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can distinguish between folded and unfolded states of protein through the binding of a hydrophobic fluoroprobe. The probe is quenched in aqueous solution but preferentially binds to the exposed hydrophobic interior of a thermally unfolded protein. The binding is detected as fluorescence emission. The results showed that the melting curve of the canonical isoform FLNa(18–21) had two distinct peaks, whereas that of the corresponding var-1 was largely featureless (Fig. 3A), suggesting that var-1 is able to bind some dye even at ambient temperatures. This implies the presence of unfolded polypeptide segments in the variant isoform. Comparison of the melting curve of FLNa(18–21) with that of the domain pairs FLNa(18–19) and FLNa(20–21) allows assignment of the first peak at 55 °C to the unfolding of FLNa(20–21) and the second peak to the unfolding of FLNa(18–19) (supplemental Fig. S2). Single domains give featureless similar to variant isoform. The partially unstable nature of FLNa(21) has been reported earlier (21Jiang P. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11055-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The unfolded part was further mapped by limited proteolysis. Chymotrypsin readily digested FLNa(18–21) var-1 isoform to three fragments (22, 19, and 15 or 12 kDa), whereas FLNa(18–21) was only slowly digested to two fragments of different size (∼23 and 20 kDa; Fig. 3, B and C). The fragments formed upon digestion of the splice variant were analyzed using N-terminal sequencing. The largest fragment of 22 kDa corresponds to an amino acid sequence extending from the middle of unstructured FLNa(19) (from Thr2108) to the C terminus of FLNa(21) (Fig. 3, C and D). The next largest fragment of 19 kDa corresponds to a fragment extending from Tyr2081 to the C terminus of FLNa(21) (Fig. 3, C and D). The smallest band in the gel (Fig. 3C) is a fragment that extends from the N terminus of FLNa(18) approximately to the middle of FLNa(19). The exact position of the C terminus could not be determined. These results show that regions of FLNa(19) are more readily accessible to chymotrypsin in the var-1 isoform. To obtain more structural information about FLNa(18–21) and its spliced variant-1, SAXS data were collected. Both FLNa(18–21) and FLNa(18–21) var-1 behaved well in the experimental conditions used, with no detectable aggregation. The shapes of the scattering profiles (Fig. 4A) indicate that both fragments adopt an extended shape. Distance distribution functions p(r) of both nonspliced and spliced isoforms are highly asymmetric with maxima near 2 nm and tails extending to longer distances (Fig. 4B). The shape of the p(r) function of the splicing variant has an additional shoulder near 4.5 nm, giving the p(r) function a bimodal character, whereas the p(r) function of the canonical isoform is closer to a monomodal shape (Fig. 4B). The degree of compactness of both fragments was analyzed using Kratky plots (Fig. 4C). This shows that the splicing variant is partly flexible as the tail of the curve is upturned, consistent with NMR data. The Rg and Dmax for the FLNa(18–21) canonical isoform were calculated in a conventional way using Guinier and Gnom analyses. For the FLNa(18–21) fragment, Rg is 3.2 (±0.01) nm, and Dmax is 11 (±0.5) nm (Table 1), suggesting an almost linear organization of domains, because individual domain pairs had previously been shown to have values of Rg = 1.9–2.1 nm and Dmax = 6.1–6.5 nm (10Heikkinen O.K.

https://openalex.org/W2094353299,"Autoparasitoids with the capacity of consuming primary parasitoids that share the same hosts to produce males are analogous to intraguild predators. The use of autoparasitoids in biological control programs is a controversial matter because there is little evidence to support the view that autoparasitoids do not disrupt and at times may promote suppression of insect pests in combination with primary parasitoids. We found that Encarsia sophia, a facultative autoparasitoid, preferred to use heterospecific hosts as secondary hosts for producing males. The autoparasitoids mated with males originated from heterospecifics may parasitize more hosts than those mated with males from conspecifics. Provided with an adequate number of males, the autoparasitoids killed more hosts than En. formosa, a commonly used parasitoid for biological control of whiteflies. This study supports the view that autoparasitoids in combination with primary parasitoids do not disrupt pest management and may enhance such programs. The demonstrated preference of an autoparasitoid for heterospecifics and improved performance of males from heterospecifics observed in this study suggests these criteria should be considered in strategies that endeavor to mass-produce and utilize autoparasitoids in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2099921235,"RIL (product of PDLIM4 gene) is an actin-associated protein that has previously been shown to stimulate actin bundling by interacting with actin-cross-linking protein α-actinin-1 and increasing its affinity to filamentous actin. Here, we report that the alternatively spliced isoform of RIL, denoted here as RILaltCterm, functions as a dominant-negative modulator of RIL-mediated actin reorganization. RILaltCterm is regulated at the level of protein stability, and this protein isoform accumulates particularly in response to oxidative stress. We show that the alternative C-terminal segment of RILaltCterm has a disordered structure that directs the protein to rapid degradation in the core 20 S proteasomes. Such degradation is ubiquitin-independent and can be blocked by binding to NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase NQO1, a detoxifying enzyme induced by prolonged exposure to oxidative stress. We show that either overexpression of RILaltCterm or its stabilization by stresses counteracts the effects produced by full-length RIL on organization of actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. Taken together, the data suggest a mechanism for fine-tuning actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to stresses.

RILaltCterm is regulated at the level of protein stability, and this protein isoform accumulates particularly in response to oxidative stress. We show that the alternative C-terminal segment of RILaltCterm has a disordered structure that directs the protein to rapid degradation in the core 20 S proteasomes. Such degradation is ubiquitin-independent and can be blocked by binding to NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase NQO1, a detoxifying enzyme induced by prolonged exposure to oxidative stress. We show that either overexpression of RILaltCterm or its stabilization by stresses counteracts the effects produced by full-length RIL on organization of actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. Taken together, the data suggest a mechanism for fine-tuning actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to stresses. RIL (reversion-induced LIM domain protein) (also known as PDLIM4) is a member of ALP/Enigma family of PDZ and LIM domain-containing adapter proteins found in association with actin cytoskeleton (1Vallenius T.

Specifically, binding to RIL increases the affinity of α-actinin-1 to filamentous actin (F-actin), leading to dramatic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (1Vallenius T. Scharm B. Vesikansa A.

Alternative splicing adds yet another level of complexity and flexibility to fine-tuning the function of ALP/Enigma proteins. With the exception of the CLP-36, the PDLIM genes were reported to express up to six alternatively spliced mRNA species that often include LIM-less isoforms. These splice variants can be tissue type-specific (such as cardiac Zasp/Cypher and skeletal muscle Zasp/Cypher in mice (30Huang C. Zhou Q. Liang P. Hollander M.S. Sheikh F. Li X. Greaser M.

Interestingly, the shorter LIM-less isoforms of Enh have been shown to negatively regulate the longer Enh variant (15Nakagawa N. Hoshijima M. Oyasu M. Saito N. Tanizawa K. Kuroda S. Biochem. Biophys.

Whether alternative splicing plays any role in modulating RIL function in these pathological states has not been addressed. In this study, we characterize the function of the shorter alternatively spliced isoform of RIL denoted here as RILaltCterm. We report that RILaltCterm is intrinsically unstable due to an unstructured region at its C terminus. Degradation of this isoform is 20 S proteasome-dependent, being modulated by binding to NQO1. We show that RILaltCterm is stabilized in response to oxidative stress and/or UV irradiation. Once stabilized, the RILaltCterm homodimerizes with full-length RIL to change its subcellular localization leading to rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and attenuation of cell migration. Constructs expressing N-FLAG and N-HA-tagged full-length RIL, RILaltCterm (Fig. 1A), and control deletion mutant RILΔCterm (lacking both exon 6 and exon 7 sequences that code for the LIM domain and/or alternative C-terminal peptide) were generated by subcloning corresponding PCR-amplified cDNA fragments into XbaI and XhoI sites of pLCMV-N-FLAG or pLCMV-N-HA, respectively. EGFP-RILaltCterm and Luc-RILaltCterm were constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified RILaltCterm cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 217–246 (30 C-terminal residues) in-frame with EGFP 2The abbreviations used are: EGFPenhanced GFPROSreactive oxygen species. into AvrII and BamHI sites of pLCMV-EGFPfus or in-frame with luciferase gene into XhoI and BamHI sites of pLCMV-Luc. For generation of Luc-RIL-Clike (control construct) a 1-nucleotide frameshift and an in-frame stop codon were introduced into cDNA sequence corresponding to the 30 C-terminal residues of RILaltCterm by PCR, and the resulting fragment was ligated in-frame with the luciferase gene into XhoI and BamHI sites of pLCMV-Luc. pLCMV-Luc-Stop refers to the nonfused luciferase expression construct. enhanced GFP reactive oxygen species. 293T, HeLa, A549, H1299, MDA-MB-435S, A431, U2OS, and RAW264.7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and appropriate antibiotics. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Lentiviral particles were packaged as described previously (47Guryanova O.A. Makhanov M. Chenchik A.A. Chumakov P.M. Frolova E.I. Mol. Biol. (Mosk). 2006; 40: 448-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using pGag1 and pRev2 helper plasmid set and pseudotyped with the VSV-G protein. Supernatants containing viral particles were collected every 12 h, pooled, and concentrated by PEG-8000 precipitation. For infection of target cells, viral preparations were diluted in complete growth media supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene. The expression was assayed 48 h post-infection. Translation inhibitor cycloheximide (at 1–5 μg/ml) was from ICN Biomedicals. Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (N-carbobenzoxyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal, at 20 μm), inhibitor of serine proteases AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, at 0.4 mm), and calpain inhibitor calpeptin (at 0.1 mm) were from Calbiochem. NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol (at 400 μm) was from Acros Organics. Cysteine protease inhibitors E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-4-guanidinobutane at 5 μm), aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin A (at 5 μg/ml), serine and cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin (at 50 μm), hypoxia mimetic deferoxamine mesylate (at 300 μm), H2O2 (0.1–0.5 mm), antioxidants N-acetyl-l-cysteine (at 0.5 mm), Ebselen (organo-selenium compound, at 0.02 mm), and β-Gal substrate o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside were from Sigma. LPS from Escherichia coli was purchased from Sigma. FLAG mAb M2 and anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal IgGs were from Sigma, GAPDH mAb was from Meridian Life Science, and HA mAb clone 12CA5 from rat was from Roche Applied Science. Antibodies against GFP (Ab-2) were from NeoMarkers. mAbs against ubiquitin (P4D1), anti-NQO1 (C-19) rabbit polyclonal IgGs, and anti-PDLIM4/RIL (D-8) mAbs predicted to recognize both isoforms of RIL and anti-actin (C-11) goat polyclonal IgGs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RIL-specific goat polyclonal antibodies were acquired from Abcam, and anti-α-actinin-1 mAbs were from Millipore. Total RNA from cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First cDNA strand was synthesized from oligo(dT)12–18 primer using SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). For PCR amplification, the following primer pairs were used: RIL (RIL4ex sense 5′-CTCGCTTTCCAGTCCCTCACAAT-3′ and RIL5ex antisense 5′-TCTAGCATGCCCTGCAAGTAGC-3′), β-actin (sense 5′-GCTTGCCATCCAACCACTCAGTCTTG-3′ and antisense 5′-GCGTCTCCTTTGAGCTGTTTGCAGAC-3′), and EGFP (sense 5′-TGACCCTGAAGTTCATCTGCACCA-3′ and antisense 5′-TGTGGCGGATCTTGAAGTTCACCT-3′). 107 HeLa cells transfected with either full-length RIL, RILaltCterm, or RILΔCterm control truncation mutant were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 5 min, harvested by scraping, and washed with ice-cold PBS with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cell pellet was resuspended in 20 volumes of polysome lysis buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1000 units/ml RNasin (Promega), and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide) and spun down at 2000 × g, and supernatant was applied onto 30% sucrose/lysis buffer cushion and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. RNA from supernatant and pellet was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by PCR. H1299 cells were transfected with Luc-stop, Luc-RILaltCterm, or Luc-RIL-Clike and a plasmid constitutively expressing β-galactosidase for transfection efficiency normalization. Cells were briefly washed in PBS and lysed in either Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) for subsequent assessment of luciferase luminescence with luciferase assay substrate or in β-Gal staining buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 2 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside in PBS), incubated at 37 °C, and assessed by photometry at 405 nm. For straight immunoblotting, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and lysate was pre-cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, cells expressing the necessary constructs were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and lysed on ice for 10 min in NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation as described above, and 500-μg aliquots were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). Detergent-soluble fractions were obtained by harvesting the cells on ice by scraping and subsequent lysis in ice-cold CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors for 10 min. Detergent-insoluble material was spun down at 10,000 × g, and pellets were resuspended in 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For Western blotting, protein lysates and prestained molecular mass standards were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), incubated with primary antibodies, extensively washed in PBS-T, and stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary species-specific IgG (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (GE Healthcare). U2OS cells expressing FLAG- or HA-tagged RIL, HA- or FLAG-tagged RILΔCterm, or both were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, blocked in 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h and then incubated with primary rabbit anti-FLAG (1:500) and rat anti-HA (1:500) antibodies in blocking solution, washed in PBS, incubated with secondary AlexaFluor 350- or AlexaFluor 594-conjugated antibodies (1:1000, Invitrogen), and counterstained with FITC-labeled phalloidin in blocking buffer. Slides were extensively washed in PBS and mounted in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech). Fluorescent pictures were taken by a Qimaging camera using Leica 1.25NA ×40 objective. Images were processed and assembled using Photoshop (Adobe). U2OS cells transduced with RILaltCterm or empty vector were grown in triplicate wells of 24-well plates, subjected to 0.5 mm H2O2 treatment for 4 h where indicated, and fixed by 4% formaldehyde (methanol-free) in cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm MES, pH 6.1, 138 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.32 m sucrose) to prevent actin depolymerization. After permeabilization by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, cells were blocked in 3% BSA and stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. F-actin content was quantified using a spectrofluorimeter (Wallac Victor2). Data were normalized by counterstaining with DAPI to quantify DNA content. For the chemotactic migration assay, RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells expressing FLAG-tagged RILaltCterm or empty vector were starved overnight in 1% FBS, treated with 0.5 mm H2O2 for 3 h where indicated, and detached, and 5 × 104 cells were seeded in triplicate into the upper chamber of a transwell system (8-μm membrane pore size). 1 μg/ml LPS added to the lower chamber was used as chemoattractant. Cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h, and then nonmigrated, cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab; membranes were fixed in methanol, and the cells were stained with DAPI. Five random fields were photographed per well, and nuclei of migrated cells were automatically counted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For the haptotactic migration analysis, U2OS cells were transfected with RILaltCterm and RILΔCterm constructs or empty vector control and 2 × 105 cells were plated per well of a 6-well plate. Cell were left to attach overnight, and spontaneous motility was followed by time-lapse microscopy for 5 h using a Leica DMI 6000B microscope equipped with 5× NA 0.12 Leica objective and heated motorized stage with humidified CO2 chamber operated by Leica LAS AF software. Images were taken every 5 min, and average migration velocity was calculated using ImageJ Manual Tracking plugin (National Institutes of Health). Approximately 20 cells per experimental group were tracked.

Unlike the major full-length isoform of RIL transcript, minor alternatively spliced isoform originally described by Bashirova et al. (2Bashirova A.A. Markelov M.L. Shlykova T.V. Levshenkova E.V. Alibaeva R.A. Frolova E.I. Gene. 1998; 210: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and denoted here as RILaltCterm lacks the sequence of exon 6. The exon skipping results in a frameshift in exon 7, leading to deletion of a C-terminal segment (106 amino acids) containing the LIM domain and its substitution with a short (22 amino acids) peptide (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the amino acid composition in the alternative product of RIL revealed a high content of proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine (PEST) residues at its C terminus. Such regions tend to be unstructured, which is characteristic of protein-destabilizing PEST sequences (48Belizario J.E. Alves J. Garay-Malpartida M. Occhiucci J.M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2008; 9: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, analysis by the globular domain/disorder predicting machines DisEMBL (49Linding R. Jensen L.J. Diella F. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Russell R.B. Structure. 2003; 11: 1453-1459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), GlobPlot (50Linding R. Russell R.B. Neduva V. Gibson T.J.

Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar) also suggests that the C terminus of RILaltCterm forms a nonfolded disordered structure (Fig. 1B). It has been previously suggested that PEST sequences are present in proteins with high turnover rate and can signal to degradation (52Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar, 53Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). To test if RILaltCterm is unstable, we expressed by lentiviral transduction into A549 cells FLAG-tagged proteins corresponding to full-length RIL, RILaltCterm, and RILΔCterm the truncation mutant lacking the frame-shifted segment. Although either of the constructs was equally expressed at the RNA level, and on Western blots there were strong bands corresponding to the full-length and RILΔCterm proteins, the level of FLAG-RILaltCterm protein was undetectable (Fig. 1C) suggesting that the unfolded protein segment might be responsible for the effect. To check for possible differences in efficiency of polyribosome entrance, we analyzed the mRNA content of different RIL isoforms bound by polyribosomes in transfected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, there was no significant variation in polyribosome entrance of different species of RIL mRNAs and mRNA of GFP used as loading/transfection control. To check the ability of the alternatively spliced C terminus of RIL to destabilize heterologous proteins, we appended the last 30 amino acids of RILaltCterm to C termini of either EGFP or luciferase to generate EGFP-RILaltCterm or Luc-RILaltCterm, respectively. Western analysis indicates that the abundance of the EGFP-RILaltCterm fusion protein was significantly lower compared with the unmodified EGFP, although corresponding mRNA levels were not significantly different (Fig. 2A). Similarly, A549 cells transduced with the EGFP-RILaltCterm construct demonstrated a dramatically decreased fluorescence, compared with the A549 cells transduced with a similar construct carrying control EGFP (Fig. 2B). The luciferase fusion construct was tested by expression in H1299 cells, in parallel with the nonfused luciferase construct and an additional control construct Luc-RIL-Clike. The latter construct has similar to the Luc-RILaltCterm structure, except for one nucleotide insertion leading to an unrelated frame-shifted C-terminal peptide. Fusion of the alternative C-terminal segment of RIL to luciferase resulted in a dramatic (almost 100-fold) decrease in enzymatic activity, whereas the RIL-Clike unrelated peptide had no significant effect on luminescent signal (Fig. 2C). Next, we decided to test whether fusion with the RILaltCterm peptide changes stability of luciferase protein. Cells expressing Luc-RILaltCterm along with two control constructs were treated with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and protein decay was monitored by measuring luciferase activity at different time points. Indeed, activity of Luc-RILaltCterm decayed steeply with a half-life of ∼1 h, although the unmodified protein along with the Luc-RIL-Clike control demonstrated a much slower decline (Fig. 2D). The results suggest that RIL alternative C terminus contains a PEST motif that can destabilize heterologous target proteins. It has been previously reported that PEST sequences may be recognized by ubiquitin E3 ligases and target the protein to 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation. To check possible ubiquitination of RILaltCterm, lysates from 293T cells transiently expressing FLAG-RILaltCterm and"

In the MT/ret model of spontaneous metastatic melanoma, myeloid cells are the most abundant tumor infiltrating hematopoietic population and their proportion is highest in the most aggressive cutaneous metastasis. Our data suggest that the tumor microenvironment favors polarization of myeloid cells into type 2 cells characterized by F4/80 expression, a weak capacity to secrete IL-12 and a high production of arginase. Myeloid cells from tumor and spleen of MT/ret mice inhibit T cell proliferation and IFNγ secretion. Interestingly, T cells play a role in type 2 polarization of myeloid cells. Indeed, intra-tumoral myeloid cells from MT/ret mice lacking T cells are not only less suppressive towards T cells than corresponding cells from wild-type MT/ret mice, but they also inhibit more efficiently melanoma cell proliferation. Thus, our data support the existence of a vicious circle, in which T cells may favor cancer development by establishing an environment that is likely to skew myeloid cell immunity toward a tumor promoting response that, in turn, suppresses immune effector cell functions."

Cost-effectiveness of 2NRTIs+NNRTI versus 2NRTIs+PI(boosted) regimens was calculated for four CD4 strata.55% of 5,541 people living with HIV (PLHIV) started HAART with CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/mm3, many of whom were Black Africans. Annual treatment cost decreased as CD4 count increased; most marked differences were observed between starting HAART with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm3 compared with CD4 count >200 cells/mm3. 2NRTI+PI(boosted) and 2NRTI+NNRTI regimens were the most effective regimens across the four CD4 strata; 2NRTI + NNRTI was cost-saving or cost-effective compared with 2NRTI + PI(boosted) regimens.To ensure more effective and efficient provision of HIV services, 2NRTI+NNRTI should be started as first-line HAART regimen at CD4 counts ≤ 350 cell/mm3, unless specific contra-indications exist. This will increase the number of PLHIV receiving HAART and will initially increase population costs of providing HIV services. However, starting PLHIV earlier on cost-effective regimens will maintain them in better health and use fewer health or social services, thereby generating fewer treatment and care costs, enabling them to remain socially and economically active members of society. This does raise a number of ethical issues, which will have to be acknowledged and addressed, especially in countries with limited resources."
https://openalex.org/W2060879634,"The GLI (GLI1/GLI2) transcription factors have been implicated in the development and progression of prostate cancer although our understanding of how they actually contribute to the biology of these common tumours is limited. We observed that GLI reporter activity was higher in normal (PNT-2) and tumourigenic (DU145 and PC-3) androgen-independent cells compared to androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells and, accordingly, GLI mRNA levels were also elevated. Ectopic expression of GLI1 or the constitutively active ΔNGLI2 mutant induced a distinct cobblestone-like morphology in LNCaP cells that, regarding the former, correlated with increased GLI2 as well as expression of the basal/stem-like markers CD44, β1-integrin, ΔNp63 and BMI1, and decreased expression of the luminal marker AR (androgen receptor). LNCaP-GLI1 cells were viable in the presence of the AR inhibitor bicalutamide and gene expression profiling revealed that the transcriptome of LNCaP-GLI1 cells was significantly closer to DU145 and PC-3 cells than to control LNCaP-pBP (empty vector) cells, as well as identifying LCN2/NGAL as a highly induced transcript which is associated with hormone independence in breast and prostate cancer. Functionally, LNCaP-GLI1 cells displayed greater clonal growth and were more invasive than control cells but they did not form colonies in soft agar or prostaspheres in suspension suggesting that they do not possess inherent stem cell properties. Moreover, targeted suppression of GLI1 or GLI2 with siRNA did not reverse the transformed phenotype of LNCaP-GLI1 cells nor did double GLI1/GLI2 knockdowns activate AR expression in DU145 or PC-3 cells. As such, early targeting of the GLI oncoproteins may hinder progression to a hormone independent state but a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms that maintain this phenotype is required to determine if their inhibition will enhance the efficacy of anti-hormonal therapy through the induction of a luminal phenotype and increased dependency upon AR function."
https://openalex.org/W2109399480,"Cells organize in complex three-dimensional patterns by interacting with proteins along with the surrounding extracellular matrix. This organization provides the mechanical and chemical cues that ultimately influence a cell's differentiation and function. Here, we computationally investigate the pattern formation process of vascular mesenchymal cells arising from their interaction with Bone Morphogenic Protein-2 (BMP-2) and its inhibitor, Matrix Gla Protein (MGP). Using a first-principles approach, we derive a reaction-diffusion model based on the biochemical interactions of BMP-2, MGP and cells. Simulations of the model exhibit a wide variety of three-dimensional patterns not observed in a two-dimensional analysis. We demonstrate the emergence of three types of patterns: spheres, tubes, and sheets, and show that the patterns can be tuned by modifying parameters in the model such as the degradation rates of proteins and chemotactic coefficient of cells. Our model may be useful for improved engineering of three-dimensional tissue structures as well as for understanding three dimensional microenvironments in developmental processes."

Targeting structural patterns instead of a constantly changing specific three-dimensional structure may represent an approach that is less sensitive to viral mutations.

Nonendotoxic LPS antagonists inhibited viral infection, demonstrating the possibility for the development of an inhibitor of HIV-1 attachment to T cells based on the recognition of a conserved structural pattern. HIV-1 represents a challenging therapeutic target because of its high replication error rate and thus rate of mutation (1Mansky L.M. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5087-5094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Highly active antiretroviral therapy is a strategy based on using a combination of inhibitors with different mechanisms of action to limit the probability of the viral resistance to all the inhibitors. The principal targets of neutralizing antibodies for HIV-1 are found in the viral protein gp120, which lies on the external side of the viral envelope. gp120 is composed of an inner, outer, and connecting domain and contains five surface-exposed mobile loops (V1 to V5) (2Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2520) Google Scholar). The early stage of viral entry involves binding of gp120 to the CD4 cell receptor causing a conformational change within gp120, resulting in the exposure of the bridging sheet and V3 loop, allowing it to bind to a chemokine coreceptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4, which is required for viral entry (3Wu L.

Virol. 2010; 84: 8777-8789Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The V3 loop thus represents one of the principal neutralizing determinants of HIV-1 (6Javaherian K. Langlois A.J. McDanal C. Ross K.L. Eckler L.I. Jellis C.L. Profy A.T. Rusche J.R. Bolognesi D.P. Putney S.D. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 6768-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). V3 is also the primary determinant of coreceptor preference, but it is still unclear how the specificity for CCR5 and/or CXCR4 is determined. T cell line-tropic strains use CXCR4 as their principal entry coreceptor (X4 strains), whereas macrophage-tropic strains use CCR5 (R5 strains) (7Hartley O. Klasse P.J. Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2005; 21: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Deletion of the V3 loop renders the envelope unable to elicit neutralizing antibodies (6Javaherian K.

Many structural studies of gp120 and the V3 loop have been carried out due to the importance of the V3 loop of gp120 for the interaction of HIV-1 with cellular receptors. Several crystal structures of gp120 have been reported (2Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A.

A common structural motif of the V3 loop in complex with neutralizing antibodies, based on experimental results and computer modeling, indicates that V3 comprises GPG(R/K/Q) sequence at the center of the loop, two extended regions flanking the central crest, and a helical region at the C-terminal segment (16Rosen O.

Four conserved structural elements in the V3 loop and two additional variable regions have been revealed based on cross-clade neutralizing antibodies and V3 peptides derived from various HIV-1 strains (20Jiang X. Burke V. Totrov M. Williams C. Cardozo T. Gorny M.K. Zolla-Pazner S. Kong X.P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because the V3 peptide is unstructured when free in solution, it probably binds to the antibodies by an induced fit mechanism and adopts a conformation that is complementary to the antibody paratope. HIV-1 infection results in chronic immune activation, contributing to immune dysfunction (21Grossman Z. Meier-Schellersheim M. Paul W.E. Picker L.J. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Increased levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and components of the LPS-activating complex have been detected in the plasma of chronically infected HIV-1-positive individuals (22Brenchley J.M. Price D.A. Schacker T.W. Asher T.E. Silvestri G. Rao S. Kazzaz Z. Bornstein E. Lambotte O. Altmann D. Blazar B.R. Rodriguez B. Teixeira-Johnson L. Landay A. Martin J.N. Hecht F.M. Picker L.J. Lederman M.M. Deeks S.G. Douek D.C. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar). LPS is a major component of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It is an amphipathic molecule, consisting of a variable hydrophilic segment comprising the polysaccharide core and O-antigen and a more conserved hydrophobic region known as lipid A. LPS is the principal stimulator of the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacteria. It is recognized by a complex cascade of extracellular “pattern recognition receptors,” which recognize the conserved motif of lipid A and present LPS to the lipid A-binding protein, MD-2, associated with the transmembrane receptor TLR4 (23Mancek-Keber M. Jerala R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recognition of various forms of LPS from different strains of Gram-negative bacteria is accomplished through the lipid A moiety, which represents the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, triggering the signaling cascade, which results in a release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and others (24Jerala R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 297: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The conserved lipid A moiety is the minimal structural fragment of LPS that triggers the cellular response (25Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there are structural differences among key extracellular LPS-sensing and -relaying receptors, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, CD14, and MD-2, the lipid A recognition motif can be reduced to the arrangement of negatively charged groups at the defined distance with a large adjacent hydrophobic patch (24Jerala R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 297: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). There are many studies on the role of LPS in HIV-1 replication or inhibition. Contradictory studies may be a consequence of the activation immune system receptors, which may result in the transcriptional activation or repression of gp120 coreceptors. For example, although it has been shown that LPS inhibits HIV-1 replication in macrophages (26Simard S. Maurais E. Gilbert C. Tremblay M.J. Clin. Immunol. 2008; 127: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), several studies have also shown that LPS enhances HIV-1 replication in monocytoid cell lines (27Genois N. Robichaud G.A. Tremblay M.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 68: 854-864PubMed Google Scholar). As we show in this study, it may also impart its effect through direct binding to gp120. Our research was initiated by the finding that a peptide from the V3 loop of gp120 exerted antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (28Cole A.M. Liao H.I. Ganz T. Yang O.O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that gp120 and the 15-residue V3 peptide (29Gurgo C. Guo H.G. Franchini G. Aldovini A. Collalti E. Farrell K. Wong-Staal F. Gallo R.C. Reitz Jr., M.S. Virology. 1988; 164: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) directly and specifically interact with different chemotypes of LPS. We determined the conformation of the V3 peptide in complex with LPS using high resolution NMR and docking methods. The specific binding of V3 to LPS was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy, by a binding assay, and by the neutralization of activation of a monocytoid cell line Mono Mac 6. We demonstrated that LPS inhibited binding of gp120 to the receptors on a target T cell line H9. Nonendotoxic LPS antagonists (tetraacylated MLK986 LPS and lipid IVa) inhibited infection by an HIV-1 pseudovirus in the U87.CD4.CCR5 cell line, indicating that nonendotoxic compounds could be potentially used in an anti-HIV therapy.

Retroviruses. 1989; 5: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin. The U87.CD4.CCR5 cell line (32Björndal A. Deng H. Jansson M. Fiore J.R. Colognesi C. Karlsson A. Albert J. Scarlatti G. Littman D.R. Fenyö E.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7478-7487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured in DMEM, 15% FBS, 2 μg/ml puromycin, 0.3 mg/ml G418, and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. Wells in a Nunc 96-microwell plate MaxiSorp (Langenselbold, Germany) were coated with increasing concentrations of V3 or 25 nm gp120 in 100 μl of a coating buffer (50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and washing five times with PBST, biotinylated S-LPS (3 μm in the case of coating with V3 or at increasing concentrations in the case of coating with gp120) was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C followed by washing five times with PBST and incubation with a streptavidin/peroxidase-conjugated polymer, diluted 1:1000 in PBST, for 2 h at 37 °C. Finally, after washing five times with PBST, 50 μl of 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid liquid substrate (ABTS) was applied to each well, and the absorbance at 390 nm was read in a Mithras LB 940 reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Wells in microtiter plates were coated with V3 (10 μm) or gp120 (25 nm) in 100 μl of the coating buffer at 4 °C overnight. During blocking with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST for 1 h at room temperature and washing five times with PBS, V3 or polymyxin B at increasing concentrations was preincubated with 3 μm biotinylated S-LPS, Ra-LPS or Re-LPS in PBST for 30 min at 37 °C. These mixtures were then added to the wells after blocking and incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C followed by washing and incubation with a streptavidin/peroxidase-conjugated polymer, dilution to 1:1000 in PBST for 2 h at 37 °C, and detection using ABTS liquid substrate. For competitive inhibition of binding of biotinylated S-LPS to V3 peptide, the peptide (2.5 μm) was first preincubated with increasing concentrations of lipid IVa or a control lipid molecule (l-α-phosphatidylinositol) for 30 min at 37 °C in the coating buffer, and then mixtures were added into the wells in microtiter plates, and coating was performed at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST for 1 h at room temperature and washing five times with PBST, 0.75 μm biotinylated S-LPS in PBST was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, the streptavidin/peroxidase-conjugated polymer, diluted 1:1500 in PBST, was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Lastly, ABTS liquid substrate was used for detection, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read in a PowerWave XS reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). A fluorescence displacement assay was performed on a multimode Mithras LB 940 reader. 100 μl of mixtures of S-LPS (0.5 μm) with V3 or polymyxin B at increasing concentrations in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, was added to the wells in microtiter plates. Fluorescence reading was performed immediately after the addition of 5 μm BC into each well. The BC excitation wavelength was 560 nm. Displacement of BC from LPS was monitored by the fluorescence emission at 611 nm at room temperature. An estimate of the percentage of free BC was calculated according to the formula ((F − Fmin)/(Fo − Fmin)) × 100, where Fo is the fluorescence intensity of BC alone, Fmin is the intensity in the presence of S-LPS alone, and F is the intensity of the S-LPS:BC mixture at varying concentrations of V3 or polymyxin B. Mono Mac 6 cells were resuspended in the culture medium without antibiotics, and their number was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml. For stimulation, 1 × 105 cells were transferred into each well of a 96-well culture plate (TPP Techno Plastic Products AG, Trasadingen, Switzerland). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at 50 ng/ml and V3 or polymyxin B at increasing concentrations were added to the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Afterward S-LPS at 20 ng/ml was added to the wells. The cultures were incubated for 16–18 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation of the culture plate for 10 min at 1200 rpm and used for the immunological determination of TNFα in a sandwich ELISA using a human TNFα ELISA kit (ImmunoTools, Friesoythe, Germany). NMR spectra were obtained in 95% H2O, 5% D2O solution at 298 K and peptide concentrations of 1–2 mm. All experiments were performed at pH 4–5. The concentrations of LPS from E. coli, serotype 055:B5, are given in mass per volume because of the heterogeneity of the polysaccharide outer core. The assignment of 1H resonances was performed using standard total correlation spectroscopy (mixing times 10 and 70 ms) and two-dimensional NOE experiments (NOESY and rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY), mixing times 80–200 ms) on a Varian Inova 600 spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) and a Bruker DMX 600 spectrometer (Billerica, MA). Water signal suppression was achieved using presaturation or WATERGATE. Two-dimensional NOESY experiments with mixing times of 80–150 ms were carried out using mixtures of V3 and LPS that correspond to 10:1 w/w ratios of both components. A NOESY experiment with a mixing time of 80 ms was used for structure determination. The spin systems in the total correlation spectroscopy NMR spectra of free V3 in aqueous solution are fairly well resolved at 25 °C and allow complete assignment of proton resonances using dαN(i, i+1) and dβN(i, i+1) connectivities in the NOESY spectra (33Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). 100 different structures of V3 were calculated using the torsion angle dynamics program DYANA (34Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar); 10 structures selected according to lowest target function were refined in a solvent box with explicit water molecules using the program CNS (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The coordinates of the lipid A portion of LPS from (37Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) (including two 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonate residues) and the V3 coordinates of five structures with the lowest target function from NMR refinement were used for molecular docking calculations using the program AutoDock (38Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9206) Google Scholar). The peptide backbone was kept rigid using the data from the transferred NOE experiments, whereas all side chains were defined as flexible using the deftors module; lipid A was treated as the macromolecule part of the docking calculation and was kept rigid. The AutoGrid calculation was run with 100 points (separated by 0.325 Å) in each spatial dimension, with the grid centered at the H2 atom of the GlcN II residue of the lipid A moiety. 20 structures were produced for each starting structure using the AutoDock module (for details, see Ref. 39Japelj B. Pristovsek P. Majerle A. Jerala R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); the top 10 generated docked structures were evaluated in the analysis step. The inhibition of binding of gp120 to the receptors on the T cell line H9 by LPS was measured by flow cytometry. First, a recombinant gp120 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 dye using an Alexa Fluor® 488 protein labeling kit following the kit instructions. A sample containing gp120-Alexa Fluor 488 (10 nm) was preincubated in PBS with Re-LPS at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in a total volume of 20 μl for 30 min at 37 °C. H9 cells (5 × 105) were resuspended in 180 μl of RPMI and then incubated together with preincubated gp120:LPS mixtures for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Afterward unbound gp120 was removed by two washes in PBS. Afterward the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS followed by flow cytometric analysis using a Coulter EPICS Altra flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter Electronics, Luton, UK). Alexa Fluor 488 was excited using a 488 argon ion laser and detected using a 525-nm emission filter. 10,000 events were acquired for each sample. Dead cells were excluded by appropriate gating. Pseudoviruses were prepared by transfecting HEK 293T with 10 μg of env-deficient HIV-1 backbone vector pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- (40He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and 10 μg of AC10.0, clone 29 (SVPB13), an env/rev expression vector (41Li M. Gao F. Mascola J.R. Stamatatos L. Polonis V.R. Koutsoukos M. Voss G. Goepfert P. Gilbert P. Greene K.M. Bilska M. Kothe D.L. Salazar-Gonzalez J.F. Wei X. Decker J.M. Hahn B.H. Montefiori D.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10108-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), using Lipofectamine 2000, as recommended by the manufacturer. Pseudovirus-containing medium was harvested 3 days after the transfection and was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), concentrated using a 100-kDa Vivaspin 20 (Sartorius Vivascience, Aubagne, France) and stored at −80 °C. The titer of pseudotyped viruses was measured using an ELISA assay kit for the p24 antigen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A day before infection, U87.CD4.CCR5 cells (1 × 104/well) were seeded in a 96-well culture plate. 80 pg/well of p24 gag equivalent pseudoviruses were preincubated with MLK986 LPS (2 μg/ml), lipid IVa (0.1 μg/ml), or medium for 90 min at 37 °C. The cells were incubated with pseudoviruses for an additional 36 h. Cells were lysed with a passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured on a Mithras LB940 luminometer. The results are represented as mean values, and the statistical significance was calculated using the Student's t test. Based on the study on the antimicrobial activity of V3-based peptide 6286 (28Cole A.M. Liao H.I. Ganz T. Yang O.O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether this peptide could bind to bacterial LPS as this could be the basis of its antibacterial activity. Indeed we demonstrated a concentration-dependent binding of S-LPS to the immobilized V3 peptide (Fig. 1A). The V3 peptide was able to displace different chemotypes of LPS differing in the size of their inner core or O-antigen from the immobilized V3 (Fig. 1C). Lipid A is the central and essential moiety responsible for the biological activity of LPS; therefore we tested whether V3 binds to LPS through its lipid A moiety. For this purpose, we used polymyxin B, a cyclic polycationic lipopeptide antibiotic, which binds to lipid A with high affinity and is considered as the “gold standard” for LPS-sequestering agents (42Wood S.J. Miller K.A. David S.A. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2004; 7: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Polymyxin B displaced different chemotypes of LPS from the immobilized V3 (Fig. 1D), which confirmed the specific binding of V3 to lipid A of LPS. The strongest binding was observed with Re-LPS, which is the smallest LPS molecule (contains only lipid A and the core without any O-antigen), and the weakest was observed with the S-LPS, which contains the largest carbohydrate chain. Specific binding of V3 to lipid A was also demonstrated using a fluorescent displacement assay with BC. BC binds to lipid A and can be displaced by compounds displaying an affinity for lipid A (42Wood S.J. Miller K.A. David S.A. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2004; 7: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We showed similar concentration-dependent competition with BC for S-LPS binding by V3 or polymyxin B (Fig. 1B). The addition of V3 also neutralized the biological activity of LPS by sequestering it from the cellular receptors as the V3 peptide inhibited LPS stimulation of the signaling pathway in Mono Mac 6 cells, as determined by the amount of secreted cytokine TNFα (Fig. 1E). Inhibition was nevertheless weaker than inhibition by polymyxin B, which is a high affinity LPS sequestering agent. The V3 peptide also inhibited biological activity of the LPS in the limulus amebocyte lysate assay (data not shown). The V3 peptide has no intrinsic tertiary structure and adopts a defined conformation only in complex with antibodies or in the presence of the str"
