https://openalex.org/W2002793897,"Most cholesterol turnover takes place in the liver and involves the conversion of cholesterol into soluble and readily excreted bile acids. The synthesis of bile acids is limited to the liver, but several enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway are expressed in extra-hepatic tissues and there also may contribute to cholesterol turnover. An example of the latter type of enzyme is cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 (CYP46A1) that is expressed at 100-fold higher levels in the brain than in the liver. Cholesterol 24-hydroxylase catalyzes the synthesis of the oxysterol 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol. To assess the relative contribution of the 24-hydroxylation pathway to cholesterol turnover, we performed balance studies in mice lacking the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase gene (Cyp46a1-/- mice). Parameters of hepatic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in the mutant mice remained unchanged relative to wild type controls. In contrast to the liver, the synthesis of new cholesterol was reduced by approximately 40% in the brain, despite steady-state levels of cholesterol being similar in the knockout mice. These data suggest that the synthesis of new cholesterol and the secretion of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol are closely coupled and that at least 40% of cholesterol turnover in the brain is dependent on the action of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase. We conclude that cholesterol 24-hydroxylase constitutes a major tissue-specific pathway for cholesterol turnover in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2139031643,"Here we describe the three-dimensional crystal structures of human glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain (GR-LBD) in complex with the antagonist RU-486 at 2.3 Å resolution and with the agonist dexamethasone ligand together with a coactivator peptide at 2.8 Å. The RU-486 structure was solved in several different crystal forms, two with helix 12 intact (GR1 and GR3) and one with a protease-digested C terminus (GR2). In GR1, part of helix 12 is in a position that covers the co-activator pocket, whereas in the GR3, domain swapping is seen between the crystallographically identical subunits in the GR dimer. An arm consisting of the end of helix 11 and beyond stretches out from one molecule, and helix 12 binds to the other LBD, partly blocking the coactivator pocket of that molecule. This type of GR-LBD dimer has not been described before but might be an artifact from crystallization. Furthermore, the subunits of the GR3 dimers are covalently connected via a disulfide bond between the Cys-736 residues in the two molecules. All three RU-486 GR-LBD structures show that GR has a very flexible region between the end of helix 11 and the end of helix 12.

A large part of the basic knowledge of the mechanism of nuclear receptor function and action has been obtained by analysis of glucocorticoid receptor function. The three-domain structure of the nuclear receptor was originally described based on results from proteolytic cleavage of GR (1Wrange O. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol.

A. 1982; 79: 4260-4264Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The first specific binding of a nuclear receptor to a defined DNA sequence, the glucocorticoid response element, was shown using purified GR (3Payvar F. Wrange O. Carlstedt-Duke J. Okret S.

Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 19: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and GR was the first steroid receptor to be cloned (partial clone) (5Miesfeld R. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. Wrange O. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1984; 312: 779-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The first three-dimensional structure of a nuclear receptor was obtained when the structure of the GR DNA-binding domain was solved (6Hard T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R. Maler B.A. Dahlman K.

Dahlman K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Freedman L.P. Maler B.A. Hyde E.I. Gustafsson J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9015-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, until recently, the structure of the GR ligand-binding domain (LBD) has proven elusive. The structures of numerous other nuclear receptor LBDs have been described, including those of most of the homologues of progesterone and androgen receptors (8Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 9Matias P.M. Donner P. Coelho R. Thomaz M. Peixoto C. Macedo S. Otto N. Joschko S. Scholz P. Wegg A. Basler S. Schafer M. Egner U. Carrondo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26164-26171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Very recently, the first GR-LBD structure was described in complex with the agonist dexamethasone and a coactivator peptide (10Bledsoe R.K. Montana V.G. Stanley T.B. Delves C.J. Apolito C.J. McKee D.D. Consler T.G. Parks D.J. Stewart E.L. Willson T.M. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Pearce K.H. Xu H.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar).The four steroid receptors, GR, the progesterone (PR), androgen (AR), and mineralocorticoid receptors, are very closely related. They all bind to response elements with the same degenerate consensus sequence (11Wahli W. Martinez E. Faseb J. 1991; 5: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and there is considerable overlap in ligand specificity and action (12Myles K. Funder J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E601-E607PubMed Google Scholar, 13Funder J.W. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 14Fuller P.J. Lim-Tio S.S. Brennan F.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Progesterone is a glucocorticoid antagonist, and many synthetic progestins are also androgens. Glucocorticoids, and particularly the endogenous hormone cortisol, bind with similar affinities to both GR and the mineralocorticoid receptor, although aldosterone is a poor GR agonist. Thus, detailed structural and functional data will be needed to understand the specific function of these four steroid receptors. Despite the problems purifying and crystallizing GR-LBD, there is a plethora of functional data obtained by analysis of mutant forms of the receptor. These data have been collated by Simons (15Simons Jr., S.S. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 49-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and provide a rich insight into the function of the LBD compared with almost all other members of the nuclear receptor family. To further understand the function of key residues of the GR-LBD and its interaction with the ligand, we have previously carried out a systematic functional analysis of mutations of specific sites within the GR-LBD (16Lind U. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1358-1370PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lind U. Greenidge P. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18515-18523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Lind U. Greenidge P. Gillner M. Koehler K.F. Wright A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19041-19049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This abundance of functional data should prove invaluable for understanding the mechanism of steroid hormone binding and action when compared with a specific structure for the GR-LBD. In this study we describe the structure of GR-LBD, both in association with the antagonist RU-486 as well as in association with the agonist dexamethasone.The antihormone RU-486 (mifepristone) is an effective antiprogestin and antiglucorticoid that has shown clinical efficacy in both functions (19Cadepond F. Ulmann A. Baulieu E.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is also a weak antiandrogen. The function of the antagonistic action of RU-486 has been shown to be an active process and not just the blocking of agonist binding. Following the binding of RU-486, GR binds more tightly to specific DNA sequences with a slower dissociation rate (20Pandit S. Geissler W. Harris G. Sitlani A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The antagonist ZK98299 appears to induce a differential PR conformation that affects the interaction with DNA (21Gass E.K. Leonhardt S.A. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1905-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is an interdomain functional interaction that is dependent on the ligand bound. Further evidence of this has been found with regard to ligand-dependent phosphorylation of GR. Although both dexamethasone and RU-486 induce phosphorylation of Ser-203, dexamethasone but not RU-486 induces phosphorylation of Ser-211 (22Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This differential phosphorylation pattern was related to the intracellular location of the subspecies of GR. Binding of RU-486 blocks the binding of coactivators at the AF-2 site while simultaneously actively recruiting the binding of corepressor NCoR or silent mediator of retinoic acid receptor and thyroid receptor (SMRT) (23Schulz M. Eggert M. Baniahmad A. Dostert A. Heinzel T. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26238-26243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This function is again dependent on the N-terminal domain of GR, although the corepressor interaction site is complex and involves sequences within the ligand-binding domain as well. In various model systems, RU-486 can act as an agonist in the absence of corepressor, acting through the N-terminal AF-1 site (23Schulz M. Eggert M. Baniahmad A. Dostert A. Heinzel T. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26238-26243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The agonist function of RU-486 can also be shown for specific glucocorticoid-induced phenotypes, such as the induction of p27Kip1, part of the cytostatic action of glucocorticoids in osteosarcoma cells (24Rogatsky I. Hittelman A.B. Pearce D. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5036-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A similar active antagonistic function of RU-486 has been shown with PR (for review, see Ref. 25Leonhardt S.A. Edwards D.P. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, a detailed analysis of the differences between the structures of GR bound to dexamethasone compared with RU-486 is of importance to understand how the ligand exerts different biological functions through one single receptor protein.Throughout this report, helix nomenclature from the original estrogen receptor structures (ERα; PDB 1ERE) will be used (26Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Production—More than 40 different constructs have been made over the years with the goal of obtaining a GR protein that has a fully functional ligand-binding pocket and is stable enough for crystallization. A purification tag consisting of His6 was also introduced at either the N or the C terminus, normally removable by thrombin cleavage. Several different fully functional mutants have also been evaluated.Two systems were used to create the recombinant Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV); BacVector (Novagen) and Bac-To-Bac (Invitrogen). GR was expressed using baculovirus-infected insect cells. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Invitrogen) were maintained as suspension cultures in shaking flasks and routinely passaged every third day. The serum-free medium Sf900II (Invitrogen) was used with the addition of gentamicin (15 μg ml–1, Sigma-Aldrich). A 100-liter stirred incubator tank (Belach Bioteknik AB) was used for large-scale expression. The cells were infected with recombinant A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (Invitrogen) containing the gene encoding human GR-LBD (residues 500 –777 expressed). The cells were harvested after 48 h and pelleted by centrifugation in a swing-out centrifuge at 2000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C. After centrifugation the cell pellet was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –70 °C.Depending on expression levels, frozen cells harvested from 5–50 liters of culture volume were disrupted by thawing in the extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm monothioglycerol (MTG), 50 μm dexamethasone) with a magnetic stirrer at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered after centrifugation and was bound to TALON chelating resin (Clontech). The resin was washed to remove unbound material according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The GR-LBD was then eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm MTG, 50 mm imidazole, and 50 μm dexamethasone. The His6 tag was removed from N-terminal constructs by thrombin cleavage (10 units/mg GR) overnight at 4 °C. The cleaved protein was loaded on a Resource 30 Q cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently eluted with a linear KCl gradient. The main peak was collected at ∼100 –125 mm KCl and concentrated using a Centriprep-30 (Millipore) to 6 – 40 mg/ml. Native-PAGE analysis showed 95–98% pure GR.For the GR-LBD RU-486 structures, the pure protein was dialyzed (Slide-A-Lyzer, Pierce) for 48 h at 4 °C against 2× 600 ml buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm RU-486. GR-LBD was finally concentrated to 5–12 mg/ml in a Centriprep-30 (Millipore) prior to crystallization.Crystallization—Crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion method in 2–3 μl of hanging drops containing equal volumes of protein and crystallization buffer. The following crystallization conditions were used. GR1 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 80 mm CaCl2,50mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 4 °C. GR2 1.5 m 1,6-hexanediol, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 2mm dithiothreitol at 12 °C. GR3 15% polyethylene glycol 8000, 900 mm 1, 6-hexanediol, 600 mm NaSCN, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 12 °C. GR4 8 –15% polyethylene glycol 400, 150 mm MgCl2, 0.2% dioxane, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 8 °C and with five times molar excess of coactivator peptide TIF2, NR-box3 (NH2-KENALLRYLLDK-COOH, ordered from ThermoHybaid, Germany).Data Collection and Structure Determination—For GR1 and GR2, diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (beamline 17-ID/Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association-Collaborative Access Team) using an attached MAR-CCD or ADSC Q-210 CCD detector, respectively. GR3 and GR4 data were collected on the beamline ID14 – 4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, also using an ADSC Q-210 CCD detector. All data were collected at 100 K.GR1 and GR2 data were integrated and scaled with the HKL2000-package (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter J.C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 307-326Google Scholar), whereas for GR3 and GR4, Mosflm and Scala were used (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr Sect D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The GR1 structure was solved by molecular replacement in CNX (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) using a GR homology model based on coordinates from a PR monomer (PDB 1A28) (8Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The subsequent structures were solved using the best available GR structure at the time.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCrystallization and Data Collection—To date, four crystal forms have been identified. The structure was first solved in the orthorhombic crystal lattice P212121 to 3.5 Å resolution (GR1) but because of poor data and difficulties in enhancing crystal quality, it was not finalized. Later a hexagonal lattice, P65, was found that diffracted to about 2.8 Å, and the crystallization was more reproducible (GR2). In this structure the complete helix 12 was absent because of enterokinase digestion. GR3 represents another orthorhombic form, P21212, that diffracts to better than 2.3 Å and with an intact C terminus. GR1-GR3 represent the antagonistic form of GR-LBD. The agonistic form (GR4) of GR-LBD crystallized in P31, and complete data to 2.7 Å resolution have been collected. The details are given in Table I. The focus will be on the last two crystal forms, GR3 and GR4.Table ISummary of data collection, processing, and refinement of GR crystalsGR1GR2GR3GR4Sequence in construct500-777500-777500-777500-777Ligand; peptideRU-486; n/aRU-486; n/aRU-486; n/aDexamethasone; TIF2 NR3Sequence seen in density531-748531-742530-776527-776Mutants from hGR sequenceC638DC638D, (N517D)N517D, F602S, C638DN517D, F602S, C638DSpace group; mol/auP212121; 2P65; 2P21212; 1P31; 4X-ray source of best data17-ID IMCA-CAT17-ID IMCA-CATID14-4, ESRFID14-4, ESRFDetectorMAR-CCDADSC Q-210ADSC Q-210ADSC Q-210Wave length (Å)1.001.000.970.97Temperature (K)100100100100Resolution (Å)48-3.5Å48-2.840-2.3Å50-2.7Unit-cell parameters (Å)a = 67.3; b = 87.4; c = 93.1a = b = 132.1; c = 53.0a = 74.5, b = 109.7, c = 39.1a = b = 129.4, c = 91.8Protein content (%)53594735Completeness (%)95100, (80)98.1 (98.0)99.9 (97.5)I/σ3.25.3 (1.2)6.7 (2.1)3.8 (2.0)Rsym (%)21.0 (42.7)13.1 (61.1)10.6 (34.8)9.0 (36.1)Wilson B (Å2)62774388Mosaicity (°)0.50.50.60.4Final R-factor (Rfree), (%)34.4 (46.8)26.6 (32.2)22.8 (26.3)24.0 (27.3)PDB IDn/an/a1NHZ1P93 Open table in a new tab The Antagonistic Form, GR3—This DNA construct included the F602S mutant, which has been reported to stabilize GR for Escherichia coli expression (30Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1245-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The construct produced more protein in the baculovirus expression system as well (4 – 8 mg/liter). The crystals grew as rods to a maximum dimension of 280 × 80 × 80 μm. One crystal was cryocooled using the well solution but with 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 15% ethylene glycol.The Agonist Form, GR4 —Hexagonal looking crystals grew to a maximal size of 100 × 50 × 50 μm following the addition of coactivator peptide TIF2 NR box 3 to purified concentrated GR-LBD expressed with dexamethasone. The crystal proved very difficult to cryocool, and the best results were obtained by rapidly passing the crystal through well solution containing 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant.Structure Determination and Refinement—The third crystal form, GR3, the best one to date, was solved in Molrep (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr Sect D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar), using a monomeric model of GR without helix 12. One large peak appeared in the rotation function map. A systematic search in the translation function revealed the P22121 solution that was very apparent with an R-factor of 52% and a correlation coefficient of 34%. After transformation to the standard setting in 21212, refinement was started in CNX. The R-factor dropped during the initial round of rigid body, B-factor, and slow cool refinement to 39% without any manual model building. RU-486 ligands were included in the CNX refinement by building the necessary libraries using XPLO2D (31Kleywegt G.J. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 31. Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1995: 45-50Google Scholar). During iterative refinement, the missing part of the structure was readily built with the Grab_build command in O version 8.04 (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Four 1,6-hexanediol molecules could be identified from a 2 Fo – Fc map and subsequently built in the electron density. The final structure was refined to 22.0% R-factor (26.2% Rfree) with good stereochemistry and has been validated in Procheck (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr Sect D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) and OOPS2 (33Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 353-356Google Scholar). In the Ramachandran plot, only 4 residues are outliers (1.8%) (34Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1395-1400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Two of them, Glu-705 and Ser-708, are in a badly defined loop.For the agonist structure GR4, a brute force systematic molecular replacement search to locate four molecules using Molrep was conducted in all possible indexed space groups with a monomeric model based on the GR3 structure and the last 40 residues of the PR structure starting from the middle of helix 11, where GR3 and PR begin to diverge. A convincing solution with three molecules in the asymmetric unit was found consisting of a dimer and a single monomer in the space group P31. The program could not find the last molecule. This solution had about 74% solvent content but refined well with a rapid decrease of the R-factors. After rigid body refinement of the three molecules, calculation of an electron density map of the complete asymmetric unit revealed unoccupied density from a fourth molecule. Using Molrep with input of fixed calculated structure factors from the three molecules, the fourth molecule could be found. Now the asymmetric unit consists of a pair of dimers. Refinement was initially carried out using Refmac (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr Sect D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) and halted at r of 31% and Rfree of 34%. Twinning analysis using Detwin (28Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr Sect D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) revealed a 7–10% twinning factor with the matrix (k,h,–l). This agrees with the fact that the data scale reasonably well in the apparent space group P321. Detwinning the data and continued refinement with Refmac show only a modest improvement of the R-factors, (31%/33%). Moving the refinement of the original data to CNX (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) and using the least squares residual for hemihedral twinning as refinement target allowed an immediate decrease of both R-factors to 24 and 27%, respectively. Even more encouraging, the resulting maps after simulated annealing and positional and grouped B-factor refinement allowed four more residues to be placed at the N terminus in three of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure is of worse overall quality compared with GR3; there are missing residues, 705–707, and a loop including residues 615– 619 involved in crystal contact is badly defined in density. (Table I).The GR-LBD structures consist of three layers of α-helices arranged in an antiparallel sandwich fashion (Fig. 2d). The overall structures of both antagonistic and agonistic GR are similar to those of other nuclear hormone receptors, in particular to the progesterone receptor (PR, PDB 1A28) (8Williams S.P.

Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) with a root mean square deviation fit on Cα atoms of 0.79 Å for residues GR531–775 and PR686 –931. With GR3 (RU), PR aligns with an r.m.s. of 0.98 Å for residues GR530 –734 and PR686 – 889 (helix 12 not included). The aligned structures share a 56.2% sequence identity. In GR3, the dimethylaniline side chain of RU 486 physically prevents helix 12 from adopting the characteristic agonist position over the ligand-binding pocket as in the GR4 (dexamethasone) structure. Differences can be seen especially with regard to the antagonist-induced conformational change C-terminal of residue Asn-734. In the GR3 structure, clear electron density can be seen for most of the amino acids ranging from amino acids 530 –776 of the full-length receptor sequence, as well as the RU-486 molecule (Fig. 1). There is one missing loop (amino acids 760 –767) after helix 12 in GR3. Residues in the loop amino acids 704 –708 show weak electron density in all structures.Fig. 1Carved-out SigmaA weighted 2 Fo - Fc map at 2.3 and 2.8 Å resolution of antagonist RU-486, GR3 (A) and dexamethasone, GR4 (B), respectively. Most notably, the 17α-hydroxyl group is coordinated by Gln-642 and a water molecule, which in turn hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Cys-736. b, dexamethasone is held in place by hydrogen bonds from surrounding residues.

Soden J. White A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but to model an antagonist conformation from an agonist one is difficult because of the large conformational change of helix 12 that can be seen, for example, in the ERα raloxifene structure (26Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). In that case, binding of an antagonist to the LBD results in displacement of helix 12 so that it prohibits binding of the coactivator.The dimethylaniline side chain of RU-486 prohibits binding of helix 12 in the agonist position as it is seen in the GR4 structure. In GR3, helix 11 is preterminated at Asn-734, whereas in GR4 the helix 11 continues to Asp-742. Instead of a helix, the structure is stretched out and the internal Cys-736 is translated over 4 Å on Cα and the side chain swings out toward the surface, going from psi = 120 to –52 degrees, i.e. a 172 degree rotation. The Cys-736 is within Van der Waal contacts with the ligands in all other structures, including that of the progesterone receptor. In GR3, the carboxyl oxygen of Cys-736 is connected to the 17α-hydroxyl group of the RU-486 molecule (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, an intermolecular disulfide is formed between the two Cys-736 residues over the crystallographic 2-fold axis, thereby rigidifying the loop between helices 11 and 11a (Fig. 2a). Helix 12 enters the other LBD subunit of the LBD dimer and binds in a hydrophobic cavity situated between the agonist position of helix 12 and the coactivator pocket. The orientation of helix 12 in GR3 is opposite to that of the traditional agonistic position like that of helix 12 of GR4. Superimposing the GR3 and GR4 structures reveals that the GR3 helix 12 is bound perpendicular to the beginning of the helix 12 position of GR4. Only Phe-749 and Met-752 reach into the same hydrophobic pocket that is occupied by Ile-756. A similar arrangement has previously been observed in the case of hERα (37Tanenbaum D.M. Wang Y.

It is unclear whether this disulfide is formed only in the crystals or only at high protein concentration or whether it has any biological implications. Tanenbaum et al. (37Tanenbaum D.M. Wang Y.

In addition, ILK was identified as a PKB/Akt Ser-473 kinase by in-gel kinase analysis and protein purification (14Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J.

These data support a role of ILK in the regulation of phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473. However, recently, a lipid-raft associated PKB Ser-473 kinase activity distinct from PDK-1, PKB, or ILK was detected (17Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), although its identity remains unknown. This finding and the reports showing that the PI 3-kinase pathway and PKB/Akt activation do not appear to be affected in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila ILK mutants have prompted a debate over the physiological role of ILK in PKB/Akt activation (23Zervas C.G.

To definitively address the question of whether ILK is essential for the promotion of phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473, we have taken two genetic approaches to down-regulate or eliminate the expression of ILK in mammalian cells and then to assess whether phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 is specifically affected. We find that ILK expression is down-regulated in HEK-293 human kidney epithelial cells by double-stranded RNA interference (siRNA) and in immortalized mouse macrophages by conditional deletion of the ILK gene using the Cre-Lox system. ILK knock-out results in the inhibition of PKB/Akt activity and specific suppression of phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473, without any effect on PKB/Akt expression or phosphorylation on Thr-308. Furthermore, the inhibition of PKB/Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation is rescued by transfection of a kinase-active ILK, but not by a kinase-inactive ILK. ILK knock-out also results in the inhibition of phosphorylation of GSK-3β and expression of cyclin D1, two known targets of PKB/Akt and ILK. Cells and Plasmids—Human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Invitrogen). Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs and plated in tissue culture plates for 2 h at 37 °C in 100 ng/ml CSF-1 in 10% fetal calf serum/Iscove's modified Dulbecco's media supplemented with 30% conditioned media from cells producing the pZip-Tex virus (18Timms J.F.

The non-adherent cells were then removed and placed in fresh tissue culture plates and allowed to differentiate into macrophages. After several passages over weeks, 100% of the cells were Mac-1-positive. Transfection of the following plasmids were carried out in macrophages using LipofectAMINE 2000: pcDNA-3-ILK-WT, pcDNA-3-ILK-S343A, pcDNA-3-ILK-S343D (14Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N.

Twenty-one-base sequences of the human ILK gene (GenBank™ accession number gi 3150001) specifically targeting the kinase domain (ILK-FSF) and the pH domain (ILK-H) were chosen. A control-NS, non-silencing siRNA (from Xeragon's data base, 16-base overlap with Thermotoga maritimia), a control-HC, inverted ILK-FSF siRNA, and a siRNA targeting calreticulin (GenBank™ accession number gi 16151096) were also designed. Each sequence was blasted to assess specificity. Transient transfections of HEK-293 cells were carried out by using 6 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Excision of the Floxed ILK Gene—Immortalized ILK fl/fl macrophages were infected with CRE recombinase adenoviruses. Cells were plated in a 6-well plate and used when they were 70% confluent. Cells were incubated with 0, 1, or 3 μl of AdCRE (5.29 × 1012 viral particles/ml) in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The volume was then increased to 2 ml, and the cells were incubated for an additional 3 h before replacement by complete media. By PCR, we assessed the presence of CRE recombinase (forward primer, 5′-CATTTCTGGGGATTGCTTATAACAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TATTGAAACTCCAGCGCGGGCC-3′), the presence of the floxed ILK gene (forward, 5′-AAGGTGCTGAAGGTTCGAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-CAAGGAATAAGGTGAGCTTCAGAA-3′), and the presence of excision products (forward, 5′-CCAGGTGGCAGAGGTAAGTA-3′; reverse, 5′-CAAGGAATAAGGTGAGCTTCAGAA-3′). After infection, cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml CSF-1. ILK protein expression was then evaluated by Western blotting as described below. For the rescue experiments, macrophages were co-transfected with 1 μg of the indicated plasmids and 0.5 μg of pEGFP, prior to infection with AdCre. Transfection efficiencies were determined by counting GFP-positive cells. The transfection efficiencies varied from ∼20 to 40%. Because of this variability and the different amounts of GFP detected by Western blotting, we performed densitometric analyses and then normalized the phosphorylation status of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 relative to GFP expression. Ratios are shown under “Results.” Immunoblots—Cells, grown in the conditions described above, were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, proteases mixture inhibitor (Roche), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1 mm sodium fluoride. Protein extracts were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with one of the following primary antibodies: anti-ILK (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., catalog no. 06–550), anti-PKB/Akt-Pser473 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PKB/Akt-Pthr308 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PKB/Akt (Transduction Laboratories), anti-GSK-3-Pser9 (New England Biolabs Inc.), anti-GSK-3β (Transduction Laboratories), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-calreticulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin D1 (UBI), or anti-GFP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Detection was carried out with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Inc.) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analyses were performed using Quantity One (software from Bio-Rad). AKT Kinase Assay—Non-radioactive AKT kinase assays were performed following the manufacturer's guidelines (Cell Signaling Technology, kit no. 9840). Briefly, 150 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated using an anti-AKT antibody, and immunoprecipitates were incubated with a GSK-3 fusion protein as a substrate. Phosphorylation of Ser-9/21 of GSK-3β, as a measure of AKT kinase activity, was then detected by Western blotting. Apoptosis Assay—Cells were stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Annexin V-positive cells undergoing apoptosis were then detected by flow cytometry analysis. To determine whether ILK is essential for the regulation of PKB/Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473, we have taken two approaches to knock down the expression of ILK and then assess PKB/Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. The first approach was the use of double-stranded RNA (siRNA) to knock down ILK expression. We identified and synthesized two specific ILK siRNAs, as well as three control RNAs (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the ILK siRNA but not a control RNA (Fig. 1A) inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the expression of V5-epitope-tagged ILK transfected into HEK-293 cells. We next determined the ability of the ILK siRNAs, a control non-silencing siRNA and a siRNA directed against a sequence from calreticulin, to down-regulate the expression of endogenous ILK. As shown in Fig. 1C, transfection of one of the ILK-specific siRNAs but not the non-silencing control siRNA or the calreticulin siRNA resulted specifically in substantial knockdown of ILK expression in HEK-293 cells as determined by Western blot analysis. The expression of calreticulin protein was only down-regulated by the calreticulin siRNA, but this siRNA had no effect on ILK expression. Transfection of the ILK-specific siRNA, which suppressed ILK expression, was the only siRNA that also suppressed phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 (Fig. 1C). To determine the specificity of the effect of down-regulating ILK expression on PKB/Akt phosphorylation, the extent of PKB/Akt phosphorylation of Thr-308 (in addition to phosphorylation of Ser-473) was determined by Western blotting using phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, whereas expression levels of actin and PKB/Akt, as well as the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Thr-308 were unchanged upon ILK knockdown, the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 was dramatically and specifically suppressed concomitant with ILK down-regulation. This effect was seen independently with two different ILK-specific siRNAs (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Effects of ILK knockdown by siRNA on downstream ILK effectors. A, 4 days post-transfection of the indicated siRNA in HEK-293 cells, the phosphorylation status of PKB/Akt on both Ser-473 and Thr-308 was assessed. Knocking down ILK expression by siRNA significantly decreased phosphorylation on Ser-473, but Thr-308 phosphorylation and PKB/Akt protein expression were not affected. Numbers indicated below each band are the quantitative values from densitometric analyses. Data shown are representative of six independent experiments. B, in the same experimental conditions as above, suppression of ILK expression by siRNA inhibited phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser-9, but did not affect GSK-3β protein expression. Cyclin D1 expression was also decreased. Numbers indicated below each band are the quantitative values from densitometric analyses. Data shown are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ILK has previously been shown to regulate the phosphorylation of Ser-9 of GSK-3β, as well as expression of cyclin D1 (19D'Amico M.

In addition, activated PKB/Akt also phosphorylates GSK-3β on Ser-9 (21van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol.

We therefore wanted to determine whether the siRNA-mediated down-regulation of ILK also inhibited the phosphorylation and expression of GSK-3β and cyclin D1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, the phosphorylation of GSK-3β is also inhibited upon the knockdown of ILK expression, whereas the levels of GSK-3β protein remained unchanged. In addition, the expression levels of cyclin D1 are also significantly suppressed by the ILK siRNAs, compared with the control. At the time point at which phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and GSK-3β were analyzed, there was a clear effect on cell growth but no significant effect on cell adhesion as the cells remained attached and spread (data not shown).

Collectively, these data provide strong genetic support for previous findings that inhibition of ILK activity by dominant-negative ILK or highly selective small molecule ILK inhibitors inhibit PKB/Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. In addition to siRNA, we have used another approach for knocking out expression of ILK in mammalian cells. We have engineered pLox-ILK mice in order to knock out ILK expression in a tissue-specific manner by crossing these mice with mice expressing Cre-recombinase under a tissue-specific promoter. The generation of homozygous pLox-ILK mice is described in detail elsewhere. 2L. Tepstra, J. Prud'homme, A. Arabian, S. Takeda, G. Karsenty, S. Dedhar, and R. St.-Arnaud, manuscript submitted. To delete ILK expression in cells derived from the pLox-ILK mice, we isolated and immortalized macrophages from these mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were then infected with adenoviral Cre-recombinase particles (22Kaartinen V. Nagy A. Genesis. 2001; 31: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to excise the ILK gene and eliminate its expression. PCR showed the expression of the Cre-recombinase, as well as the excision of the Lox-P site from the floxed ILK gene (Fig. 3A). The expression of ILK protein was substantially inhibited in a dose-dependent manner 5 days post-infection of the Cre-recombinase (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3B, phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 was significantly inhibited concomitant with the knockdown of ILK expression in cells grown in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serumand100ng/mlCSF-1(conditions which lead to PI3-kinase-dependent activation of PKB/Akt). Phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Thr-308 was unaffected as were the expression levels of PKB/Akt and actin. No detectable phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 was detected in the absence of serum and CSF-1 in cells not infected with AdCre (data not shown). ILK expression was also unaffected under these conditions (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, ILK knockdown also resulted in the inhibition of phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser-9 as well as cyclin D1 expression, whereas GSK-3β protein levels remained unchanged. A similar analysis in mammary epithelial cells derived from the pLox-ILK mice also resulted in inhibition of PKB/Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation after ILK deletion by CRE infection. 3A. Troussard, N. Mawji, and S. Dedhar, unpublished data. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3C, both phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 and PKB/Akt kinase activity were substantially inhibited upon knockdown of ILK expression. These data support results from the siRNA experiments and further demonstrate that ILK expression is essential for the specific phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 and for the regulation of PKB/Akt activity. The macrophages in which ILK expression was depleted were observed to grow poorly compared with the control cells. Closer examination demonstrated that these cells were undergoing apoptosis as determined by annexin-V staining (Fig. 3D) as would be expected because of the inhibition of PKB/Akt activity. The role of the kinase activity of ILK in its function has been questioned based on data showing that ILK kinase activity is not required for certain functions in C. elegans and Drosophila (23Zervas C.G. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Mackinnon A.C. Qadota H. Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. Williams B.D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition, it has previously been suggested that ILK may regulate PKB/Akt phosphorylation indirectly (13Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards P.A. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We therefore carried out rescue experiments to assess the role of the ILK kinase activity in the regulation of PKB/Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. We co-transfected the macrophage cells from the pLox-ILK mice with expression constructs encoding wild-type ILK (ILK-WT) or kinase-inactive ILK-S343A mutant (14Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and a GFP construct and then infected the cells with AdCre. We have previously demonstrated that the S343A mutant of ILK does not have catalytic activity as determined by in vitro kinase assay of recombinant proteins (14Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, analysis of the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt Ser-473 relative to the amount of GFP expression demonstrates that ILK-WT was more efficient at rescuing the inhibition of phosphorylation of PKB/Akt than the kinase-inactive ILK-S343A mutant. Because the transfection efficiencies for each mutant varied (see “Experimental Procedures”), we quantified the ratio of Ser-473-PKB/Akt phosphorylation to GFP for each transfection from three independent experiments (Fig. 4B). The data show that ILK-WT rescued Ser-473 phosphorylation by an average factor of 2.303 ± 0.315 compared with the ILK-S343A mutant. This difference is statistically significant (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). In Fig. 4C, we also analyzed the effect of the kinase-active ILK-S343D mutant (14Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Both kinase-active ILK-WT and ILK-S343D constructs rescued phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473. Again, the kinase-inactive ILK-S343A mutant was inefficient at rescuing the phosphorylation. After normalization, densitometric analyses revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-473 PKB/Akt after rescue by ILK-WT or ILK-S343D was 2.9 and 2.57 higher, respectively, compared with rescue by ILK-S343A. These results demonstrate that the regulation of the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 by ILK is dependent on its kinase activity and suggest that ILK may phosphorylate this site directly. These data are in agreement with our previous biochemical data showing that ILK phosphorylates PKB/Akt in an in-gel kinase assay (14Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and that highly specific small molecule inhibitors of ILK kinase activity inhibit PKB/Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 (14Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 16Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It should be noted that although the kinase catalytic domain of ILK differs from other kinase domains, ILK has been demonstrated to behave as a bona fide serine-threonine kinase in the context of phosphorylation of other substrates besides PKB/Akt, such as myosin light chain, myosin phosphatase target subunit, and myosin phosphatase inhibitors, PHI-1 and CPI-17 (25Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 26Deng J.T. Sutherland C. Brautigan D.L. Eto M.

Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 211-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the extensive level of inhibition of phosphorylation of Ser-473 upon knockdown of ILK expression in the cell types analyzed, ILK either functions as a direct PKB/Akt Ser-473 kinase (or PDK-2), or it is a major cellular regulator of the putative PKB/Akt Ser-473 kinase activity identified recently in a high molecular weight plasma membrane lipid-raft complex (17Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, an alternative explanation of our results could be that Ser-343 of ILK is a phosphorylation site important for the recruitment of PKB/Akt. Although the phosphorylation of Ser-343 has not been demonstrated directly, we have previously shown that ILK and PKB interact and that substitution of ILK-Ser-343 with alanine results in the inhibition of interaction with PKB/Akt, whereas substitution with an aspartic acid (mimicking phosphorylation) maintains the interaction (14Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Therefore, both ILK-WT and the ILK-S343D mutant can rescue PKB/Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation because they may promote both interaction and phosphorylation (either by ILK itself or by another kinase), whereas the ILK-S343A mutant can do neither. A recent report further solidifies a role of ILK in the regulation of PKB/Akt-mediated suppression of apoptosis. It has been demonstrated (28Di-Poi N. Tan N.S. Michalik L. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β (PPARβ) modulates PKB/Akt activation via the specific transcriptional up-regulation of ILK and PDK-1, revealing a novel mechanism for the control of PKB/Akt signaling. Collectively these data demonstrate an essential role for ILK in the regulation of phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 and GSK-3β on Ser-9, as well as in the regulation of expression of cyclin D1. In further support for this, the targeted knock-out of ILK in chondrocytes, by crossing the pLox-ILK mice with type-2 collagen-Cre mice, also results in the inhibition of PKB/Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation and suppression of expression of cyclin D1 in vivo in the chondrocytes of long bones.2 The data presented in this paper establish ILK as an important and essential physiological regulator of the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on Ser-473 and PKB/Akt activation."
https://openalex.org/W2109105334,"The C-terminal region (cA) of the major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (LysM domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. The cA domain could be deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. This AcmA derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete. The cA domain and a chimeric protein consisting of cA fused to the C terminus of MSA2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via cA. The fusion protein also bound to many other Gram-positive bacteria. By chemical treatment of purified cell walls of L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with cA. Immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, B. subtilis, Lactobacillus sake, and Lactobacillus casei cells. Based on these studies, we propose that LysM-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of AcmA. Lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. For L. lactis SK110, it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no MSA2cA binding is observed.

Lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. For L. lactis SK110, it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no MSA2cA binding is observed. The major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 is a peptidoglycan hydrolase that is required for cell separation and is responsible for cell lysis during stationary phase (1Buist G. Karsens H. Nauta A. van Sinderen D. Venema G. Kok J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2722-2728Google Scholar, 2Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Google Scholar). The 40.3-kDa secreted mature protein is subject to proteolytic degradation (3Buist G. Venema G. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5947-5953Google Scholar, 4Poquet I. Saint V. Seznec E. Simoes N. Bolotin A. Gruss A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1042-1051Google Scholar) resulting in a number of activity bands in a zymogram of the supernatant of a lactococcal culture. Bands as small as that corresponding to a protein of 29 kDa were detected, all representing products of AcmA (2Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Google Scholar). From experimental data and homology studies, we inferred that AcmA consists of two domains: an active site domain and a C-terminal region containing three highly homologous repeats of 45 amino acids (cA), which might be involved in cell wall binding. Since the smallest active protein is 29 kDa, it was proposed that the protein undergoes C-terminal proteolytic breakdown (1Buist G. Karsens H. Nauta A. van Sinderen D. Venema G. Kok J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2722-2728Google Scholar, 2Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Google Scholar). Nearly all cell wall hydrolases seem to consist of a catalytic domain and usually, but not always, a domain containing a number of specific amino acid repeats (5Joris B. Englebert S. Chu C.P. Kariyama R. Daneo-Moore L. Shockman G.D. Ghuysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 70: 257-264Google Scholar, 6Diaz E. Lopez R. Garcia J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5464-5471Google Scholar). Mur1 of Streptococcus thermophilus and Mur, the N-acetylmuramidase of Leuconostoc citreum, do not contain such repeats (7Husson-Kao C. Mengaud J. Benbadis L. Chapot-Chartier M.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 187: 69-76Google Scholar, 8Cibik R. Tailliez P. Langella P. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 858-864Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan hydrolyzing activity of Mur could be detected in vitro, but Mur on its own was not able to complement an acmA mutation in L. lactis. However, expression of a Mur-cA fusion protein was able to play the role of AcmA in cell separation after cell division in L. lactis acmA (8Cibik R. Tailliez P. Langella P. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 858-864Google Scholar). Cell wall hydrolases of various bacteria and bacteriophages contain repeats similar to those present in AcmA. These repeats are also called LysM (lysin motif) domains, since they were originally identified in bacterial lysins (9Birkeland N.K. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 658-665Google Scholar). The presence of the LysM domains is not limited to bacterial proteins. They are also present in a number of eukaryotic proteins, whereas they are lacking in archaeal proteins (10Bateman A. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1113-1119Google Scholar). A cell wall binding function has been postulated for a number of proteins containing LysM domains (5Joris B. Englebert S. Chu C.P. Kariyama R. Daneo-Moore L. Shockman G.D. Ghuysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 70: 257-264Google Scholar, 9Birkeland N.K. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 658-665Google Scholar, 11Hourdou M.L. Guinand M.

Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1855-1867Google Scholar). Partially purified muramidase-2 of Enterococcus hirae, a protein similar to AcmA and containing six LysM domains, binds to peptidoglycan fragments of the same strain (13Kariyama R. Shockman G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3236-3241Google Scholar). The p60 protein of Listeria monocytogenes contains two LysM domains and was shown to be associated with the cell surface (14Ruhland G.J. Hellwig M. Wanner G. Fiedler F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 609-616Google Scholar). The γ-d-glutamate-meso-diaminopimelate muropeptidases LytE and LytF of Bacillus subtilis have three and five repeats, respectively, in their N termini and are both cell wall-bound (15Margot P. Pagni M. Karamata D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 57-65Google Scholar, 16Margot P. Wahlen M. Gholamhoseinian A. Piggot P. Karamata D. Gholamhuseinian A. J.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3178-3184Google Scholar). However, which particular parts of these enzymes entailed the binding capacity has not been examined in any of these studies. Some spore-specific proteins in B. subtilis also contain LysM domains. His tag fusions of the spore proteins YdhD, YkuD, and YkvP (containing one LysM domain) were produced during sporulation and could be detected in mature spores (19Kodama T. Takamatsu H. Asai K. Ogasawara N. Sadaie Y. Watabe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 655-663Google Scholar, 20Kodama T. Takamatsu H. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Ogasawara N. Watabe K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4584-4591Google Scholar). SafA (YrbA), a protein involved in spore assembly, localized to the outer rim of the cortex and is apparently targeted to the spore by its N-terminal LysM domain (21Ozin A.J. Henriques A.O. Yi H. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1828-1833Google Scholar). When the signal sequence of β-lactamase was replaced by the two N-terminal LysM domains of the spore protein YaaH, β-lactamase assembled in spores. The authors speculated that the LysM domain functions as a kind of signal sequence involved in assembly on forespores (20Kodama T. Takamatsu H. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Ogasawara N. Watabe K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4584-4591Google Scholar). The structure of one of the two LysM domains of the Escherichia coli lytic transglycosidase MltD has been resolved by NMR studies (10Bateman A. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1113-1119Google Scholar). The domain has a βααβ structure. In the same study also a potential substrate-binding site could be identified. A loop, present between β-strand 1 and α-helix 1 lies at the end of a shallow groove on the surface of the domain. A conserved aspartate or glutamate in this shallow groove could be involved in the interaction with the ligand (10Bateman A. Bycroft M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1113-1119Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe that the LysM domains bind directly to peptidoglycan. The binding is not species-specific; the domain binds to many Gram-positive bacteria with different peptidoglycan structures. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that the domain binds to specific loci on the cell surface. Specific chemical treatments of cells and cell walls indicate that a cell wall component, extractable with trichloroacetic acid, is responsible for hindering of AcmA binding, thereby causing this localized binding.

Enzyme Assays and Optical Density Measurements—AcmA activity was visualized on G½M17 agar plates containing 0.2% autoclaved lyophilized Micrococcus lysodeikticus ATCC 4698 cells (Sigma) as halos around L. lactis colonies after overnight growth at 30 °C. X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (PepX) was measured as described by Buist et al. (3Buist G. Venema G. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5947-5953Google Scholar). Absorbance was measured in a Novaspec II spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences) at 600 nm. Autolysis of L. lactis was analyzed by following the absorbance at 600 nm of a 100-fold diluted overnight culture in fresh G½M17 medium for 6 days at 30 °C. DNA Manipulations and Transformations—Molecular cloning techniques were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrotransformation of E. coli and L. lactis was performed by using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) as described by Zabarovsky et al. (24Zabarovsky E.R. Winberg G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5912Google Scholar) and Leenhouts et al. (25Leenhouts K.J. Venema G. Med. Fac. Landbouw. Univ. Gent. 1992; 57: 2031-2043Google Scholar), respectively. Minipreparations of plasmid DNA from E. coli and L. lactis were obtained by the alkaline lysis method as described by Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and Seegers et al. (26Seegers J.F. Bron S. Franke C.M. Venema G. Kiewiet R. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1291-1300Google Scholar), respectively. PCR products were purified using the High Pure PCR purification kit (Roche Applied Science). Construction of AcmA Derivatives—A stop codon and EcoRI restriction enzyme site (italics and underlined in oligonucleotide REPDEL, respectively) were introduced in acmA at the end of the sequence specifying the active site domain. This was done by PCR using the primers REPDEL (5′-CGCGAATTCCTTATGAAGAAGCTCCGTC) and ALA-4 (5′-CTTCAACAGACAAGTCC), annealing within the sequence encoding the signal peptide of AcmA and pGKAL1 as the template. The PCR product was digested with SacI and EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBluescriptSK+, leading to pDEL. Subsequently, the 1187-bp PflMI/EcoRI fragment of pGKAL1 (2Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Google Scholar) was replaced by the 76-bp PflMI/EcoRI fragment of pDEL, resulting in pGKAL5, which was obtained in L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1. SDS-PAGE, Detection of AcmA Activity, Western Blotting, and Immunodetection—L. lactis cell and supernatant samples were prepared as described before (3Buist G. Venema G. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5947-5953Google Scholar). AcmA activity was detected by a zymogram staining technique using SDS-polyacrylamide (12.5 or 17.5%) gels containing 0.15% autoclaved, lyophilized M. lysodeikticus ATCC 4698 cells (Sigma) as described before (2Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Google Scholar). The standard low range and prestained low and high range SDS-PAGE molecular weight markers of Bio-Rad were used as references. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Applied Science) as described by Towbin et al. (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Biotechnology. 1992; 24: 145-149Google Scholar). MSA2 antigen was detected with 10,000-fold diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-MSA2 antiserum (28Ramasamy R. Yasawardena S. Kanagaratnam R. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Ramasamy M.S. Parasite Immunol. 1999; 21: 397-407Google Scholar); AcmA was detected with 3000-fold diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-AcmA antiserum (laboratory collection), using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and the ECL chemiluminescent detection system and protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Wall Isolation and Chemical Treatment—Cultures of L. lactis and B. subtilis (50 ml each) were pelleted, and cells resuspended in 5 ml of water were broken by vigorous shaking in the presence of glass beads (29van de Guchte M. Kodde J. van der Vossen J.M. Kok J. Venema G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 2606-2611Google Scholar). Nonbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (5 min, 2000 × g). The cell walls were isolated from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation (15 min, 20,800 × g). Cell walls were washed several times with water and lyophilized. Equal aliquots of cell walls (0.1 mg) were resuspended in 1 ml of water, 10% SDS, or 10% trichloroacetic acid and boiled for 15 min. Subsequently, the cell walls were washed, once with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LTA, lipoteichoic acid(s). ;75mm NaPi, pH 7.3, 68 mm NaCl) and four times with 1 ml of water. L. lactis and Lactobacillus casei cells were treated with trichloroacetic acid by boiling 25 μl of cell culture in 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Lactobacillus helveticus was treated with SDS by boiling 25 μl in 10% SDS. The cells were washed as described for the chemically treated cell walls. Purification of PA3—L. lactis PA1001 containing plasmid pPA3 was grown overnight at 30 °C in GM17 supplemented with 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Subsequently, the cells were diluted 100-fold in 1 liter of fresh GM17 and induced with 1 ml of nisin-containing supernatant of an overnight culture of L. lactis NZ9700. The cells were cultivated for 24 h at 30 °C. Cells and supernatant were separated by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 rpm, after which the latter was filter-sterilized and concentrated with Vivaflow 200 (molecular mass cut-off of 10 kDa) to 20 ml and buffered with 80 ml of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8. To lower the salt concentration in the sample, 100 ml of H2O were added. The sample was loaded on a 5-ml prepacked AKTA-prime SPSepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), which was equilibrated with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8. The column was washed with 25 mm sodium phosphate until the absorbance measured at 214 nm did not change anymore. Subsequently, bound proteins were eluted with a 200-ml NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 m. Fractions of 4 ml were collected. The fractions containing highly pure PA3 were collected and desalted using a high trap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was kept in H2O at –20 °C at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/ml. Binding of Proteins to Lactococcal Cells, Cell Walls, and Purified Peptidoglycan—The cells of 2 ml of exponential phase cultures of MG1363acmAΔ1 were collected by centrifugation and gently resuspended in an equal volume of supernatant of similarly grown MG1363acmAΔ1 carrying either plasmid pGK13 (empty vector), pGKAL1 (expressing acmA), or pGKAL5 (expressing truncated acmA) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, the mixtures were centrifuged. Of the supernatants, 0.4 ml was dialyzed against three changes of 1 liter of demineralized water, after which they were lyophilized and dissolved in 0.2 ml of denaturation buffer (30Beliveau C. Potvin C. Trudel J. Asselin A. Bellemare G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5619-5623Google Scholar). The cell pellets were washed with 2 ml of fresh medium, after which cell-free extracts were prepared in 1 ml of denaturation buffer. Binding of the MSA2cA fusion protein was studied by growing L. lactis NZ9000 containing pNG304 or pNG3041 until an A600 of 0.4 was reached. The cultures were induced with nisin (by adding one-one thousandth volume of the supernatant of the nisin producer L. lactis NZ9700) and incubated for 2 h. The cells of 1 ml of MG1363acmAΔ1 culture, 0.1 mg of cell walls, or 0.5 mg of peptidoglycan were resuspended in 1 ml of supernatant of either of the two induced cultures. Then the suspensions were spun down, and the pellets were washed with 1 ml of fresh M17 medium, resuspended in 100 μl of denaturation buffer (30Beliveau C. Potvin C. Trudel J. Asselin A. Bellemare G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5619-5623Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-10% PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. The supernatant fractions, containing nonbound proteins, were concentrated 10 times using phenol and ether extraction (31Sauve D.M. Ho D.T. Roberge M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 382-383Google Scholar). The concentrated supernatants were diluted with 1 volume of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-10% PAGE. To study the binding efficiency of MSA2cA to different peptidoglycan types, 50-μg samples of peptidoglycan isolated from M. luteus and C. flaccumfaciens were mixed with the protein. A dilution range of the protein was prepared by diluting the supernatant containing MSA2cA in supernatant of an L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 culture. To study binding of PA3, 15 μg of purified PA3 was added to 70 μl of trichloroacetic acid-pretreated L. lactis cells (described above) in a total volume of 1 ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (1010 cells/ml). The samples were incubated for 20 min on a blood cell suspension mixer at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were spun down (3 min, 20,000 × g), and unbound proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h on ice and subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g. Precipitated proteins were washed with acetone, air-dried, and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. The cell pellets were washed with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Samples (25 μl) of bacterial cultures or the chemically treated bacterial cells were pelleted and washed once with 1 ml of water. The pellets were resuspended in L. lactis NZ9000 (pNG3041) culture supernatant containing MSA2cA and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with 1 ml of ½M17 and subsequently incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 100 μl of PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing anti-MSA2 antibody (diluted 1:400) with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After three washing steps with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) (PBST), the cells were incubated for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, containing a 1:400 dilution of Oregon Green anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBST and transferred to a poly-l-lysine-coated microscopic slide (Omnilabo, Breda, The Netherlands), which was air-dried at ambient temperature. Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA) was added, a coverslip was mounted, and fluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, CA) and an Axion Vision camera (Axion Technologies, Houston, TX). Lectin Binding Studies—Fluorescein-labeled Ricinus communis agglutinin I lectin (RCA120) (Vector) was diluted to 10 μg/ml in lectin binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl). L. lactis cells from 100 μl of overnight culture were spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of the diluted lectin. The suspension was incubated for 10 min on ice, and the cells were washed once in lectin binding buffer (100 μl) and resuspended in the same volume. Samples (5 μl) were spotted onto microscopic slides for fluorescence microscopy as described above. AcmA Is a Modular Protein Containing an N-terminal Cell Wall-degrading Domain—We have previously analyzed the amino acid sequence of the L. lactis autolysin AcmA using Blast algorithms and PFAM and reported that mature AcmA probably consists of two domains (2Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is predicted to contain the active site, whereas the C-terminal domain contains a putative cell wall binding domain. This cell wall binding domain consists of three homologous so-called LysM domains (9Birkeland N.K. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 658-665Google Scholar), separated by nonhomologous amino acid sequences (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether the N-terminal domain of AcmA indeed carries the active site, a deletion variant lacking the putative cell wall binding domain was created by introducing a stop codon downstream of the codon for Ser218. The gene encoding truncated AcmA variant (A1–218; see Fig. 1A) is expressed from the acmA promoter in the vector pGKAL5. The AcmA-negative strain L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 was transformed with pGKAL1, encoding wild type AcmA, or pGKAL5 and was plated on plates containing cell walls of M. lysodeikticus. Cells expressing acmA produced a clear halo around their colonies, whereas colonies of cells producing A1–218 did not. Cells containing pGKAL5 formed long chains, resulting in culture sedimentation, as has also been shown for the AcmA-negative strain L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 (2Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Google Scholar). Autolysis was substantially reduced upon deletion of the C-terminal domain. Whereas a 36.7% reduction of the absorbance at 600 nm was observed for L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 (pGKAL1) after 60 h of incubation at 30 °C, only 15.6% of A600 reduction was observed for L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 expressing A1–218. This reduction was similar to that of L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 (15.2%) (Table II). Only 0.3 arbitrary units of the intracellular peptidase PepX were present in the supernatant of the two AcmA-defective strains, whereas 19.8 arbitrary units were present in an equal volume of supernatant of the AcmA-producing culture L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 (pGKAL1).Table IIProperties of L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 expressing AcmA derivativesPlasmid in acmAΔIAcmAaA1-218: AcmA lacking all three LysM repeats.Reduction in A600bThe A600 reduction was calculated using the formula, [(Amax — A60 h)/Amax] × 100%.PepX activitycActivity is in arbitrary units measured as the increase of absorption at 405 nm in time.HalodThe sizes of the halos were measured in millimeters from the border of the colony after 45 h of incubation at 30 °C.SedimentationeAnalyzed by visual inspection of standing G½M17 cultures after overnight growth in test tubes.AcmA activityfIn zymograms of samples from end-exponential phase G½M17 cultures; sup, supernatant fraction; cfe, cell-free extract.Cell bindinggBinding of AcmA derivatives in supernatants of end-exponential phase G½M17 cultures to end-exponential phase cells of L. lactis MG1363acmAΔ1 after 20 min of incubation at 30 °C (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).supcfe%pGK13-15.20.30+---pGKAL1+36.719.85.0-+++pGKAL5A1-21815.60.30+++-a A1-218: AcmA lacking all three LysM repeats.b The A600 reduction was calculated using the formula, [(Amax — A60 h)/Amax] × 100%.c Activity is in arbitrary units measured as the increase of absorption at 405 nm in time.d The sizes of the halos were measured in millimeters from the border of the colony af"

Recent studies suggest that P2 nucleotide receptors and ecto-nucleotidases compete for a limited pool of endogenously released nucleotides within cell surface microenvironments that are functionally segregated from the bulk extracellular compartment. To test this hypothesis, we have used luciferase-based methods to continuously record extracellular ATP levels in monolayers of human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells under resting conditions, during stimulation of Ca2+-mobilizing receptors for thrombin or acetylcholine, and during mechanical stimulation by hypotonic stress. Soluble luciferase was utilized as an indicator of ATP levels within the bulk extracellular compartment, whereas a chimeric protein A-luciferase, adsorbed to antibodies against a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored plasma membrane protein, was used as a spatially localized probe of ATP levels at the immediate extracellular surface. Significant accumulation of ATP in the bulk extracellular compartment, under either resting (1–2 nm ATP) or stimulated (10–80 nm ATP) conditions, was observed only when endogenous ecto-ATPase activity was pharmacologically inhibited by the poorly metabolizable analog, βγ-methylene ATP. In contrast, accumulation of submicromolar ATP in the cell surface microenvironment was readily measured even in the absence of ecto-ATPase inhibition suggesting that the spatially colocalized luciferase could effectively compete with endogenous ecto-ATPases for released ATP. Other experiments revealed a critical role for elevated cytosolic [Ca2+] in the ATP release mechanism triggered by thrombin or muscarinic receptors but not in basal ATP release or release stimulated by hypotonic stress. These observations suggest that ATP release sites are colocalized with ecto-ATPases at the astrocyte cell surface. This colocalization may act to spatially restrict the actions of released ATP as a paracrine or autocrine mediator of cell-to-cell signaling.

ATP and other nucleotides function as intercellular signaling molecules when released to extracellular compartments. Genes encoding seven ionotropic P2X nucleotide receptor subtypes (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Google Scholar), eight G protein-coupled P2Y nucleotide receptor subtypes (2Abbracchio M.P. Boeynaems J.-M. Barnard E.A. Boyer J.L. Kennedy C. Miras-Portugal M.T.

Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 299-309Google Scholar) have been identified in human and other vertebrate genomes. Most mammalian cell types express one or more subtypes of nucleotide receptor together with various combinations of the ecto-nucleotidases used for degrading and/or interconverting extracellular nucleotides (5Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492Google Scholar). Recent studies using knockout mice that lack expression of particular nucleotide receptors or ecto-nucleotidases have suggested important in vivo roles for extracellular ATP or other nucleotides in a variety of inflammatory, nociceptive, hemostatic, and motility responses (6Fabre J.E.

The physiological sources of the extracellular nucleotides that elicit these complex tissue responses remain largely un-characterized. A major exception is the well established ability of neurons, neuroendocrine cells, and platelets to release ATP via Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of nucleotides compartmentalized within synaptic vesicles or dense core granules (13Unsworth C.D. Johnson R.J. Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 353-365Google Scholar). However, many cell types that express nucleotide receptors lack direct physical proximity to neurons or degranulating platelets. Thus, identification of alternative sources of extracellular nucleotides, as well as elucidation of additional cellular mechanisms that underlie the release of nucleotides, are significant areas of current investigation (14Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1-C8Google Scholar). Because all cells contain ATP, all cell types are potential sources of extracellular ATP given appropriate physiological or pathological stimuli. Two recurring themes have emerged in recent studies of ATP release from cell types other than neurons or platelets. First, intact cells constitutively release ATP at low rates by mechanisms that do not involve obvious lysis or loss of plasma membrane integrity (15Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24348-24354Google Scholar, 16Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11735-11739Google Scholar, 17Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Google Scholar). Second, the rate of non-lytic ATP release can be greatly increased by various extrinsic stimuli that result in perturbation of cell volume, shape, cytoskeletal organization, or intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Several factors complicate or limit studies aimed at the direct quantitative evaluation of physiologically relevant ATP release. Cells express multiple ecto-nucleotidases that can rapidly hydrolyze ATP released at the extracellular surface (3Zimmermann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 231-236Google Scholar, 4Zimmermann H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 299-309Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that ATP may also be synthesized from extracellular ADP via transphosphorylation reactions catalyzed by extracellular forms of nucleotide disphosphokinase (NDPK) 1The abbreviations used are: NDPK, nucleotide disphosphokinase; TRAP, thrombin receptor activating peptide; BSS, basal saline solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxy-methyl)ethyl]glycine; RLU, relative light unit; βγMeATP, βγ-methylene ATP; proA-luc, protein A-luciferase chimeric protein; BAPTA, 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; PAR, protease-activated receptors; eNTDPase, ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphospho hydrolase. or adenylate kinase (17Lazarowski E.R.

Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Although released or synthesized ATP will initially be spatially confined within unstirred layers at the cell surface, it will subsequently be diluted by diffusion and/or convection into the bulk extracellular volume. For these reasons, ATP concentrations at the extracellular surface will change rapidly and reflect a balance between the rates of release, hydrolysis, synthesis, and dilution into interstitial compartments (in vivo) or bathing media (in vitro). Most studies of ATP release have involved removal of samples from the bulk extracellular media bathing cultured cells or isolated tissues at selected time points following stimulation; this is followed by subsequent analysis of ATP or ATP-derived metabolites within these media samples (14Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1-C8Google Scholar, 15Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24348-24354Google Scholar, 16Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Insel P.A. J.

Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). The ATP levels measured in such bulk extracellular media samples are likely to significantly underestimate the amount of ATP actually released at the cell surface, particularly in cells/tissues with substantial unstirred surface layers or high ecto-ATPase activities. For example, assays based on second messenger accumulation in astrocytes and epithelial cells indicate that non-lytic mechanical stimuli trigger the release of ATP and other nucleotides in amounts sufficient for robust autocrine (or paracrine) activation of various G protein-coupled P2Y nucleotide receptors (15Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24348-24354Google Scholar, 16Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11735-11739Google Scholar, 17Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Google Scholar). However, the concentrations of nucleotide directly measured in the media bathing these stimulated cells are orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations required for threshold activation of known P2Y receptors. This suggests that nucleotide receptors and ecto-nucleotidases compete for a limited pool of endogenously released nucleotides within cell surface microenvironments that are functionally segregated from the bulk extracellular compartment. To address this possibility, we have used luciferase-based methods to continuously record ATP levels in extracellular compartments of human 1321N1 astrocytoma cell monolayers under resting conditions, during activation of Ca2+-mobilizing receptors, or during mechanical stimulation by hypotonic stress. Soluble luciferase was used as an indicator of ATP levels within the bulk extracellular compartment whereas a surface-adsorbed protein A-luciferase was employed as a spatially localized probe of ATP levels at the immediate cell surface. Significant accumulation of ATP in the bulk extracellular compartment, under either resting or stimulated conditions, was observed only when endogenous ecto-ATPase activity was pharmacologically inhibited. In contrast, accumulation of submicromolar ATP in the cell surface microenvironment was readily measured even in the absence of ecto-ATPase inhibition. This indicated that the spatially colocalized luciferase could effectively compete with endogenous ecto-ATPases for released ATP. Other experiments revealed a critical role for elevated cytosolic [Ca2+] in the ATP release mechanism triggered by thrombin or muscarinic receptors but not in ATP release stimulated by hypotonic stress. Our observations indicate that ATP release sites are functionally colocalized with ecto-ATPases at the astrocyte cell surface. This colocalization may act to spatially restrict the actions of released ATP as a paracine or autocrine mediator of cell-to-cell signaling. Reagents—Firefly luciferase ATP assay mix (FL-AAM), ATP standards (FL-AAS), luciferin (luciferase substrate), monoclonal anti-human CD14 antibody (clone UCHM-1), potato apyrase (grade I), thrombin (from bovine plasma), carbachol, digitonin, and βγ-methylene ATP (βγMeATP) were from Sigma-Aldrich. A synthetic peptide (SFLLRD) that acts as a thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) reagent was obtained from SynPep. Cell lysis assays were performed using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals lactate dehydrogenase assay kit. BAPTA-AM and fura2-AM were obtained from Molecular Probes. proA-luciferase was purified from JM109 Escherichia coli cells transformed with pMALU5 plasmid DNA provided by Dr. Eiry Kobatake (Tokyo Institute of Technology). CD14 cDNA in pcDNA3 was generously provided by Dr. Paul Godowski (Genentech). Wild-type 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells were obtained from Drs. Ken Harden and Jose Boyer (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Cell Culture—1321N1 human astrocytoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For some experiments, 1321N1 cells were transfected with human CD14 cDNA using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Selection of cells that stably express CD14 was accomplished with G418 (500 μg/ml) added 48 h after transfection. After 3 weeks of selection, the stably transfected cultures (1321N1-CD14) were maintained under continuous G418 selection. For all luciferase-based experiments, 1321N1 cells were seeded on 35-mm dishes (Falcon) at 3 × 105 cells per dish. All experiments were conducted on confluent cell monolayers cultured for 5 to 7 days post-plating such that each dish contained ∼1 × 106 cells. Some experiments used 1321N1 cell suspensions (∼1 × 106/ml) prepared by standard trypsin (0.05%) detachment procedures. Assay of ATP Levels in the Bulk Extracellular Media Compartment by Soluble Luciferase—An online luciferase-based protocol for measuring extracellular ATP levels in cultures of adherent cell monolayers was adapted from methods first developed by Schwiebert and co-workers (21Taylor A.L. Kudlow B.A. Marrs K.L. Greunert D.C. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 275: C1391-C1406Google Scholar, 22Schwiebert L.M. Rice W.C. Kudlow B.A. Taylor A.L. Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C289-C301Google Scholar) and recently modified by our laboratory (23Beigi R. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7189-7198Google Scholar). All extracellular ATP measurements were performed using a Turner Designs (TD 20/20) luminometer capable of accommodating 35-mm culture dishes. Unless otherwise stated, 35-mm dishes with adherent cells were washed twice with 2 ml of basal saline solution (BSS) containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The washed monolayers were then bathed in 1 ml of BSS and incubated for ∼45 min at room temperature (22–24 °C), prior to experimental manipulation. Experiments were performed at room temperature using cell-free or cell-containing 35-mm dishes treated under identical assay conditions. Lyophilized firefly luciferase ATP assay mix (FL-AAM; Sigma) containing luciferase, luciferin, MgSO4, dithiothreitol, EDTA, BSA, and Tricine buffer was reconstituted with 5 ml of sterile filtered water and stored in frozen 500-μl aliquots. For experiments, aliquots were thawed at room temperature and diluted 1:25 (40 μl) into the 35-mm dishes (± adherent 1321N1 cells) containing 1 ml of BSS immediately prior to start of luminescence recordings. ATP-dependent changes in extracellular luciferase activity were measured as relative light unit (RLU) values integrated over 5-s photon counting periods with dishes being gently stirred between readings. For most experiments, the luciferase activity was recorded every 1 or 2 min for up to 150 min. ATP contamination and possible effects of various test reagents on luciferase activity were assessed using cell-free 35-mm dishes under identical assay conditions. Calibration curves were generated for each experiment by addition of ATP standards (FL-AAS; Sigma) to cell-free dishes. Under these assay conditions, the limit of ATP detection was 100 pm (100 fmol/1 ml assay volume), and luminescence was linear with increasing ATP concentration to 1000 nm. Ecto-ATPase Assay—To assess the ecto-ATPase activity of 1321N1 cell monolayers under conditions used for the ATP release experiments, a pulse of 100 nm exogenous ATP was added to cell-free dishes or 1321N1 monolayers containing luciferase assay medium as described above. Decreases in ATP-dependent luminescence were recorded every 2 min for 20 min. Ecto-ATPase inhibition studies were performed using resting 1321N1 monolayers that were incubated with various concentrations of the poorly metabolizable analog βγMeATP 10 to 15 min prior to addition of the 100 nm ATP pulse. ATP Release Stimuli—After extracellular luciferase activity reached steady state, 1321N1 cells were stimulated for up to 20 min with 2 units/ml thrombin (1 units/ml = 24 nm), 3 μm of the SFLLRD-TRAP, 100 μm carbachol, or hypotonic stress (a 30% decrease in tonicity) in the absence or presence of βγMeATP (3–300 μm). In some experiments, thrombin was tested at concentrations ranging from 0.1 milliunits/ml (2.4 pm) up to 3 units/ml (72 nm) whereas SFLLRD-TRAP was varied from 30 nm through 10 μm. Luciferase activity was recorded every 1–2 min during the stimulation period. All additions to the 1-ml ATP assay volumes were made from 100- to 1000-fold concentrated stocks of the various test reagents. To stimulate cells by hypotonic stress, 405 μl of BSS was carefully replaced with 405 μl of an otherwise identical, luciferase-supplemented assay solution lacking only NaCl; this reduced the NaCl concentration of the extracellular assay medium from 130 to 77 mm. Control experiments involving replacement of 405 μl of assay solution with an equivalent volume of fresh, isotonic assay medium verified that this medium replacement protocol produced negligible mechanically induced ATP release. Separate ATP calibrations were performed for the reduced NaCl assay medium to control for the known effects of Cl– concentration on luciferase activity (51Maroto R. Hamill O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23867-23872Google Scholar, 66Denburg J.L. McElroy W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 114: 668-675Google Scholar). At the end of each assay, the cells were permeabilized with digitonin (50 μg/ml) to release cytosolic ATP as a measure of relative cell mass. Potato apyrase (5 units/ml) was used to scavenge released extracellular ATP and provide an index of background light production. Assay of ATP Levels in the Extracellular Surface Microenvironment by Cell-attached Luciferase—Measurements of ATP in the cell surface microenvironment were performed by antibody-dependent adsorption of a protein A-luciferase chimeric protein (proA-luc) to the extracellular surface of intact 1321N1 cells. proA-luc was expressed in bacteria as described previously (24Beigi R. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: C267-C278Google Scholar). Briefly, pMALU5-transformed cultures of JM109 E. coli were lysed by sonication in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 200 μg/ml lysozyme and protease inhibitors. The soluble lysate fraction containing recombinant proA-luc chimeric protein was filtered through 0.2-μm Acrodisks (Gelman Sciences), applied to a HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), and buffer-exchanged into a minimal BSS lacking calcium, magnesium, glucose, and BSA using fast protein liquid chromatography protocols. The buffer-exchanged bacterial lysates were pooled, tested for luciferase activity, and stored as 1-ml aliquots at –80 °C. 35-mm culture dishes containing either 1321N1-CD14 or wild-type 1321N1 cell monolayers were washed once with 2 ml of BSS and incubated with gentle stirring for 1 h at room temperature in 1 ml of BSS containing 1 μg of anti-CD14 antibody. Following removal of the primary antibody solution, the cell monolayers were washed once with 2 ml of BSS and then incubated with 1 ml of buffer-exchanged bacterial lysate containing undiluted proA-luc for 1 h at room temperature with gentle stirring. The proA-luc solution was then aspirated, and the cell monolayers were washed with 2 ml of BSS. The cells were then re-equilibrated for ∼30 min in 1 ml of fresh BSS at room temperature before being supplemented with 150 μm luciferin (2.5 μl of 60 mm stock/ml). ATP release was stimulated using 2 units/ml thrombin with and without βγMeATP (300 μm) to decrease ATP scavenging at the cell surface. proA-luc activity was recorded every 12 s for up to 18 min. Control experiments on wild-type 1321N1 versus 1321N1-CD14 cells incubated with and without anti-CD14 antibody verified that maximal proA-luc attachment was dependent on both CD14 expression and pre-incubation with anti-CD14 antibody. Calibration curves were generated by addition of exogenous ATP standards to anti-CD14 and proA-luc-coated 1321N1-CD14 cells. Manipulation and Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration—The role of cytosolic [Ca2+] in basal and stimulated ATP release was studied using either 1321N1 cell monolayers or suspensions as described above. 1321N1 cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 0.1% BSA plus or minus the cell-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM at 10 μm for 30 min at 37 °C. BAPTA-loaded or mock-loaded 1321N1 monolayers were then used for luciferase-based assays of extracellular ATP exactly as described above. Suspended cells were prepared for measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration by incubation in BSS containing 1 μm fura2-AM at room temperature for 1 h. The suspensions were washed twice with BSS before fura2 fluorescence (339-nm excitation and 500-nm emission) was measured and calibrated at 37 °C in a stirred cuvette as described previously (25Dubyak G.R. Cowen D.S. Meuller L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18108-18117Google Scholar). The effects of thrombin, SFLLRD-TRAP, carbachol, or βγMeATP on intracellular Ca2+ were measured in parallel samples of BAPTA-loaded or non-BAPTA-loaded cells. Data Evaluation—Individual experimental manipulations were performed using duplicate or triplicate dishes of 1321N1 monolayers from the same cell passage. Integrated RLU recordings of luciferase activity were immediately downloaded into Microsoft Excel using the Turner Designs spreadsheet interface software (version 2.0.1; Sunnyvale, CA). RLU values were converted to ATP concentrations using calibration curves generated on the same day using identical assay solutions and conditions. Prism 3.0™ software (GraphPad) was used to compute the S.E. of the calculated ATP levels from identical, independent experiments that were repeated two to seven times. For ecto-ATPase inhibition studies, Excel (Microsoft) was used to fit the decay of the exogenously added ATP bolus to an exponential curve. Rate constants (k) were then calculated for each curve fit. All experiments were repeated two to seven times. Figures were generated using Prism 3.0™ (GraphPad) and Illustrator 7.0 ™ (Adobe) software. Constitutive ATP Release and Extracellular Metabolism by Human 1321N1 Astrocytes at Steady State—Immediately after 35-mm dishes of 1321N1 monolayers were washed and transferred from tissue culture medium to the luciferase-supplemented assay medium, 50–70 nm ATP was present in the bulk 1-ml extracellular volume (Fig. 1A). This elevated extracellular ATP reflects release of endogenous ATP from the cells because of mechanical stimulation of poorly characterized ATP release pathways (15Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24348-24354Google Scholar, 17Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Google Scholar). The ATP then rapidly decreased to ∼2 nm within 20 min. Within 45–60 min after medium transfer, the extracellular ATP stabilized at a non-zero steady state of ∼1nm ATP that was 10-fold higher than the limit of ATP detection (100 pm) under these assay conditions. Addition of potato apyrase to the assay medium caused a rapid decrease in extracellular [ATP] to the limit of assay detection (not shown). The steady-state content of 1 pmol of ATP measured in the 1-ml extracellular volume was equivalent to only 0.01–0.02% of the total digitonin-releasable ATP (5–10 nmol) within the ∼106 1321N1 cells that comprised each monolayer. Longer term incubation of the monolayers for up to 100 min failed to decrease extracellular ATP levels to the assay detection limit. Addition of digitonin (as a plasma membrane permeabilizing agent) to cell-containing dishes, but not cell-free dishes, resulted in a rapid increase in bulk extracellular [ATP] to ∼5 μm. This provided a measure of total cytosolic ATP content and was consistent with a cytosolic concentration of 5 mm ATP being diluted 1000-fold into the 1-ml assay volume from the ∼1-μl total intracellular volume of the 106 cells that comprise the 1321N1 monolayer. When the monolayers were pulsed with 100 nm ATP after 100 min of equilibration, this exogenous ATP was degraded at a rate similar to that which characterized the scavenging of the ATP released from endogenous stores upon medium exchange (Fig. 1B). The ATP level decayed with a single exponential rate consistent with a t½ of ∼12–14 min. In contrast, when 100 nm ATP was added to cell-free plates containing identical luciferase assay medium, the ATP was degraded at a much slower rate reflecting the intrinsic pyrophosphatase activity of the luciferase used as the ATP sensor. In another study, we have developed the use of βγMeATP as an inhibitor of the ecto-ATPase(s) expressed by 1321N1 astrocytes. 2S. M. Joseph and G. R. Dubyak, unpublished observations. Those experiments indicated that βγMeATP could be used at millimolar concentrations with no confounding side effects because of ATP contamination, inhibition of luciferase as an ATP sensor, or action as a nucleotide triphosphate substrate for ecto-NDPK-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular ADP (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows that 300 μm βγMeATP markedly inhibited (by 95%) the ability of 1321N1 monolayers to rapidly scavenge a 100 nm pulse of exogenous ATP. Effects of Ecto-ATPase Inhibition on Steady-state ATP Levels in the Bulk Extracellular Medium—If the basal [ATP] within the bulk extracellular medium reflects a steady-state balance between constitutive ATP release and hydrolysis by ecto-ATPases, then acute inhibition of the ecto-ATPases should perturb this steady-state and result in an elevated level of extracellular ATP. Fig. 2A illustrates how acute addition of 300 μm βγMeATP causes extracellular ATP to gradually increase to ∼3 nm ATP over 20 min. In the absence of βγMeATP, extracellular ATP remained at the 1 nm steady-state level over this same time period. This slow accumulation of extracellular ATP induced by βγMeATP corresponded to an ATP release rate of ∼0.1 pmol/min/106 cells. Because similar results were observed using monolayers that were not periodically agitated after addition of the βγMeATP (not shown), cell lysis was an unlikely cause for this slow accumulation of ATP in the bulk extracellular compartment. Identical experiments using cell-free dishes verified that the βγMeATP-mediated increase in ATP concentrations was dependent on the presence of 1321N1 monolayers and was not because of de novo synthesis of extracellular ATP as a consequence of contaminating adenylate kinase or nucleotide"

The density of ROMK channels on the cortical collecting duct apical membrane is exquisitely regulated in concert with physiological demands. Although protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of one of the three phospho-acceptors in Kir1.1, Ser-44, also a canonical serum-glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK-1) phosphorylation site, controls the number of active channels, it is unknown whether this involves activating dormant channels already residing on the plasma membrane or recruiting new channels to the cell surface. Here we explore the mechanism and test whether SGK-1 phosphorylation of ROMK regulates cell surface expression. Removal of the phosphorylation site by point mutation (Kir1.1, S44A) dramatically attenuated the macroscopic current density in Xenopus oocytes. As measured by antibody binding of external epitope-tagged forms of Kir1.1, surface expression of Kir1.1 S44A was inhibited, paralleling the reduction in macroscopic current. In contrast, surface expression and macroscopic current density was augmented by a phosphorylation mimic mutation, Kir1.1 S44D. In vitro phosphorylation assays revealed that Ser-44 is a substrate of SGK-1 phosphorylation, and expression of SGK-1 with the wild type channel increased channel density to the same level as the phosphorylation mimic mutation. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of SGK-1 was completely abrogated by mutation of the phosphorylation site. In conclusion, SGK-1 phosphorylation of Kir1.1 drives expression on the plasmalemma.

Indeed, aldosterone, vasopressin, and other factors precisely regulate SK activity, controlling potassium excretion in accord with the demands of potassium balance. Because ROMK channels normally exhibit a very high open probability, near unity, physiologic augmentation of channel activity, as controlled by hormones and dietary potassium (9Wang W. Sackin H. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), is achieved largely by regulated changes in the number of active channels on the plasmalemma. Although the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for physiological augmentation of ROMK channel surface density have remained unclear, a growing body of evidence has pointed to an important role of protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. Like the native secretory channel (10Wang W. Giebisch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 88: 9722-9725Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar), ROMK activity is dependent on direct PKA phosphorylation (11McNicholas C.M. Wang W. Ho K. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8077-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Xu Z.C. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. J. Biol.

Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10274-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In fact, activation of ROMK by PKA is thought to underlie the regulation of renal potassium transport by vasopressin (14Cassola A.C. Giebisch G. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F502-F509PubMed Google Scholar). All three PKA phospho-acceptor sites in ROMK, embedded within the cytoplasmic NH2-(Ser-44) and COOH termini (Ser-219 and Ser-313), must be phosphorylated for full channel function (15MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-FF22PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, single channel experiments revealed that the different PKA phospho-acceptors regulate the channel through different mechanisms (15MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-FF22PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the two COOH-terminal sites are required to maintain the channel in a high open probability state (15MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-FF22PubMed Google Scholar), controlling both pH-dependent gating (16Leipziger J. MacGregor G.G. Cooper G.J. Xu J. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 279: F919-F926Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate-dependent activation of the channel (17Liou H.H. Zhou S.S. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the NH2-terminal site, on the other hand, has no effect on channel open probability. Instead, it appears to control the number of active channels on the cell surface (15MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-FF22PubMed Google Scholar), reminiscent of the way vasopressin affects the activity of the native secretory channel (14Cassola A.C. Giebisch G. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F502-F509PubMed Google Scholar). Just how this is achieved remains a fundamental question in the field. In particular, it is unknown whether phosphorylation of the serine 44 residue simply switches a pre-existing pool of inactive channels on the membrane into an active gating mode or drives cell surface expression by a vesicular trafficking process. Close inspection of the NH2-terminal PKA site in ROMK1 reveals that it also falls within a canonical serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1) phosphorylation sequence (recognized by a RXRXX(S/T) (18Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 19Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar)), suggesting that the channel, and serine 44 in particular, might also be a target of SGK1. This observation has potentially important physiological ramifications. SGK1, a member of the PKB/Akt family of serine/threonine kinases (20Lang F. Cohen P.

Conceivably, SGK1 might also control the number of functional ROMK channels at the plasmalemma and explain how aldosterone regulates renal potassium secretion. It should be pointed out that an early test of this idea, using a co-expression assay with the Xenopus orthologue of SGK-1 and the mammalian ROMK channel, failed to detect a permissive action of the kinase (26Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has remained uncertain whether the negative result was a consequence of the xenogeneic nature of the experimental design, or the requirement of A-kinase-associated protein-like proteins, or the high level of basal phosphorylation state of ROMK in oocytes. Interestingly, a recent report that SGK activation of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger-3 is facilitated by the sodium-hydrogen exchange regulatory factor-2 (NHERF-2) (27Yun C.C. Chen Y. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7676-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), a PDZ protein found in the collecting duct (28Wade J.B. Welling P.A. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C192-C198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that directly interacts with ROMK, 2D. Yoo and P. A. Welling, unpublished observations. provided further incentive to evaluate if mammalian SGK-1 regulates the ROMK channel. The goals of the present study were to determine the mechanism by which phosphorylation of serine 44 in ROMK controls channel activity and to determine whether this residue is a substrate for the aldosterone-induced kinase, SGK-1. Here we show that SGK-1 phosphorylates serine 44 to drive cell surface expression, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for aldosterone-dependent regulation of the secretory potassium channel. Molecular Biology—A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was introduced into the extracellular loop of ROMK by overlap extension PCR at position 113 of ROMK1. Both ends of the epitope were flanked by two glycine residues to enhance accessibility and flexibility of the extracellular HA tag, creating a sequence which reads 111EFGGYPYDVPDYAGGYP. ROMK1 serine 44 was changed to alanine or aspartic acid using Stratagene's QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mouse SGK-1 cDNA, encoding the entire reading frame, was amplified from reverse-transcribed mouse kidney RNA with the PCR by using SGK-1-specific primers (5′-GGGACGATGACCGTCAAAGC-3′, and 5′-AGCACTCAGAGGAAGGAATCCAC-3′). All constructs used for studies in Xenopus oocytes were subcloned between the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene in the modified pSD64 vector to increase expression efficiency (29Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). This vector also contains a polyadenylate sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (dA23dC30). With the exception of EGFP-ROMK, all constructs used for mammalian expression were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen). EGFP was engineered onto the NH2 terminus of HA-ROMK by subcloning the epitope-tagged Kir1.1 in-frame with EGFP in the pEGFP-Cl (Clontech). The sequence of all amplified or modified cDNAs was confirmed by dye termination DNA sequencing (University of Maryland School of Medicine Biopolymer Core). cRNA Synthesis—Complementary RNA was transcribed in vitro in the presence of capping analogue G(5′)ppp(5′) from linearized plasmids containing the cDNA of interest using SP6 RNA polymerase (mMessage Machine, Ambion Inc.). cRNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitated with ammonium acetate/isopropyl alcohol. Yield was quantified spectrophotometrically and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocyte Isolation and Injection—Oocytes from female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Homosassa, FL) were isolated and maintained using the standard procedures as described previously (30Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, frogs were anesthetized with 0.15% 3-aminobenzoate, and a partial oophorectomy was performed through an abdominal incision. Oocyte aggregates were manually dissected from the ovarian lobes and then incubated in OR-2 medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing collagenase (type 3, Worthington) for 2 h at room temperature to remove the follicular layer. After extensive washing with collagenase-free OR-2, oocytes were stored at 19 °C in OR-3 medium (50% Leibovitz's medium, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). 12–24 h later, healthy looking Dumont stage V–VI oocytes were pneumatically injected with 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing 0–1 ng of cRNA and then stored in OR-3 medium at 19 °C for 2–6 days. Electrophysiology—Whole cell currents in Xenopus oocytes were monitored using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp as described previously (30Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar, 31Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were bathed in a 45 mm K solution (45 mm KCl, 45 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Voltage sensing and current injecting microelectrodes had resistances of 0.5–1.5 megohms when backfilled with 3 m KCl. Once a stable membrane potential was attained, oocytes were clamped to a holding potential of –20 mV, and currents were recorded during 500-ms voltage steps, ranging from –100 to +40 mV in 20-mV increments. Data were collected using an ITC16 analogue to digital, digital to analogue converter (Instrutech Corp.), and filtered at 1 kHz and digitized on line at 2 kHz using Pulse software (HEKA Electronik) for later analysis. ROMK currents are taken as the barium-sensitive inward current (2 mm barium acetate) as we have done before (31Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Flagg T.P. Yoo D. Sciortino C.M. Tate M. Romero M.F. Welling P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 351-362Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Values reported in the text are the barium-sensitive inward currents at –100 mV. Cation permeability ratios (PK/PNa) were estimated from the change in reversal potential induced by replacing extracellular potassium with an equivalent concentration of sodium as we have done before (30Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar). Surface Expression—Plasmalemma expression of the external HA-tagged ROMK1 channel was measured in single oocytes following procedures outlined by Zerangue et al. (33Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In these studies, oocytes were washed two times in cold OR-2 medium, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in OR-2 for 15 min at 4 °C, and washed 3 times in OR-2. To block spurious antibody binding, oocytes were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in OR-2 containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Exposed HA epitopes on the surface of intact oocytes were labeled with a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science, 1 μg/ml, 3F10, 1% BSA, 4 °C overnight), and then oocytes were washed at 4 °C with OR-2 and incubated with HRP-coupled goat anti-rat (The Jackson Laboratories, 1 μg/ml, 1% BSA, 4 °C, 3 h). Cells were washed for 1 h at 4 °C with OR-2 containing 1% BSA then again for 10 min in OR-2 medium without BSA. Individual oocytes were placed in 50 μl of enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. Luminescence from single oocytes was measured for 10 s in a Sirius luminometer and reported as relative light units per s. Western Blot Analysis—Oocytes were processed following the protocol described by Kamsteeg and Deen (34Kamsteeg E.J. Deen P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to isolate proteins from total membrane. In brief, oocytes were washed twice in homogenization buffer (80 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm NaH2PO4,1mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) and then broken by trituration with a 25-gauge syringe. To pellet yolk proteins and nuclei, homogenates were spun twice at low speed (100 × g) for 10 min. Supernatants were then spun at high speed (14,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C to collect the total membrane fraction. Pellets were washed once in the homogenization buffer and spun at top speed again for 10 min and then placed in solubilization buffer (4% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, containing the protease inhibitors) and rocked for 2 h at 37 °C. Particulate material was pelleted (14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the solubilized proteins in the supernatant were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (0.1%) (TBS-T) containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche Applied Science) was diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk to 0.1 μg/ml and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, washed for 15 min in TBS-T, incubated with goat anti-rat antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:5000, 5% non-fat dry milk), and washed extensively for 20 min in TBS-T. Bound antibodies were then revealed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and fluorography (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.). Fluorographs were assessed by densitometry using NIH Image. Integrated optical density of each band is reported in arbitrary units where the control is considered to be 1 unit. Immunofluorescence of COS-7—Cells, grown on glass coverslips, were transfected with DNA (2 μg total) using Gene Juice (Novagen). After 2 days, cells were washed in ice-cold modified Ringer's solution (144 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in Ringer's solution for 15 min at 4 °C. One group of cells was permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times in the modified Ringer's solution before blocking. Non-permeabilized cells were not treated with Triton. Both groups where blocked with 1% BSA in the modified Ringer's solution for 30 min at room temperature and labeled with primary antibody in 0.1% BSA (rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) at 10 ng/ml; mouse anti-PDI 1:100) for 3 h at room temperature and then washed in modified Ringer's solution three times. Next, cells were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to either Alexa 488 or 568 (goat anti-rat at 1:100; goat anti-mouse 1:100, Molecular Probes) in 0.1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides were then washed and mounted onto slides in VectaShield and sealed with nail polish. Cells were visualized using a 410 Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope under a 63× oil immersion lens. Images were acquired at a zoom of 2 and a pinhole size of 18 using 16-frame averaging and were processed with Adobe Photoshop. In Vitro Phosphorylation of ROMK by SGK-1—To determine whether ROMK is a substrate of SGK-1 phosphorylation, in vitro phosphorylation assays were conducted using a constitutively active, recombinant form of SGK-1 (Δ1–60, S422D, SGK-1, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Either immunopurified ROMK or ROMK synthetic peptides were used as substrates. For the ROMK immunoprecipitation study, COS-7 cells were transfected with the HA epitope-tagged Kir1.1 using Gene Juice (Novagen). 48 h post-transfection, cells were sequentially washed with ice-cold modified Ringer's solution and lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4), harvested in cold lysis buffer with protease inhibitor mixture, and resuspended at 5× cell volume with cold lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and 1% Triton X-100. Cells were passed through a 27½-gauge needle, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates containing the soluble proteins were precleared with 100 μl of 50% Sepharose CL-4B slurry for 2 h rotating at 4 °C. Precleared COS lysates were then rotated overnight with 100 μl of 20% protein-G Sepharose slurry with 2 μg of rabbit anti-HA antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton. SGK-1 phosphorylation of immunopurified ROMK bound on Sepharose beads was carried out with an active recombinant SGK-1 purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), according to their recommendations as described below. Once the phosphorylation reaction was complete (30 °C, 60 min), immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times in ADBI buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Bound proteins were eluted by incubating at room temperature for 30 min in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and run on 12% acrylamide gels. Gels were dried using gel drying sheets (Promega) and exposed to autoradiography film (Kodak, X-Omat) for 1–3 h. In parallel immunoprecipitation reactions, eluates were run on 12% acrylamide gels followed by Western blot analysis as described earlier with rat anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the wild type ROMK NH2 terminus (residues, 34–48) and a mutant negative control peptide containing a serine to alanine substitution at position 44 were synthesized by University of Maryland Baltimore Biopolymer core facility. In vitro phosphorylation of the peptides by SGK-1 was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, reactions (50 μl), containing the peptide (80 μm), SGK-1 (1–25 ng), [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/μl), protein kinase C inhibitor (20 μm), and PKA inhibitor (2 μm) in ADBI buffer, were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. Aliquots of the reaction were transferred onto the center of a P81 filter paper square and then washed 3 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid followed by another 3 washes in acetone. The P81 squares were placed in scintillation fluid, and bound ratio activity was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. Aliquots of the reaction were also resolved on Tris-Tricine acrylamide gels (16.5%) followed by autoradiography. To determine the apparent Km values for SGK and PKA phosphorylation of the Ser-44 site in ROMK, in vitro phosphorylation reactions were carried out as described above with varying amounts of the wild type ROMK peptide (0–200 μm) over the initial, linear rate of phosphorylation (0–10 min). Constitutively active recombinant SGK-1, as above, and purified bovine heart PKA catalytic subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were used. Parallel phosphorylation reactions, containing identical specific activities of either SGK-1 or PKA, were performed in triplicate and compared. Specific activity was independently determined by measuring rates of phosphate transfer to the optimum phosphorylation motif of each kinase (SGK (RPRAATF); PKA (GRTGRRNSI)). Quantitation of SGK mRNA Expression by Real Time PCR—Mice, maintained on a standard rodent chow, were placed on a high potassium diet containing 10% KCl for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 days. Kidneys were harvested, and total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Two micrograms of total kidney RNA was reverse-transcribed by using Omniscript (Qiagen). Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 or actin cDNAs were separately amplified in parallel real time PCRs, containing an aliquot of the reverse-transcribed reaction, 0.2× SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes), and 50 pmol of either serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK)-specific primers (forward 5′-TGTCTTGGGGCTGTCCTGTATG-3′; reverse 5′-GCTTCTGCTGCTTCCTTCACAC-3′) or actin-specific primers (forward 5′-GGCATTGTTACCAACTGGGACG-3′; reverse 5′-GCTTCTCTTTGATGTCACGCACG-3′) in separate wells using the Bio-Rad iCycler real time PCR detection system. Each sample was amplified in triplicate. Specificity of the amplified product was determined using melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. For quantification, real time PCR of serially diluted SGK cDNA was carried out as a positive control and to establish an optimal threshold cycle detection level; threshold cycle values, Ct, of the test samples were then measured from cycle-dependent product amplification curves (Bio-Rad software package iCycler version 3.0a). The change in SGK transcript, reported as the fold induction over the actin control, was calculated using the 2(–ΔΔCt) method (35Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using GB-Stat™ for Macintosh statistics package (Dynamic Microsystems, Inc). Analysis of variance followed by Fisher's LSD Post Hoc test was performed to verify significance. Values of at least p < 0.05 were considered significant. All data are given as mean ± S.E. Surface Expression Assay—Phosphorylation of the serine 44 residue regulates ROMK either by activating dormant channels already residing on the plasma membrane or by recruiting new channels to the cell surface, two mechanisms that can be distinguished readily by differences in cell surface expression. Accordingly, we incorporated a hemagglutinin epitope tag into the extracellular loop of the ROMK channel so that plasmalemma channel levels could be quantified accurately by antibody binding. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, HA-tagged ROMK carried weakly inward-rectifying, K+-selective (PK/PNa >15) and barium-sensitive currents identical to those observed for the wild type channel (Fig. 1). To measure relative amounts of surface HA-tagged ROMK, we employed a method that combines enzyme amplification with the sensitivity and linearity of analytical luminometry as originally described by Zerangue et al. (33Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In this assay, exposed HA epitopes on the surface of intact oocytes were labeled with a monoclonal antib"

Each of the antigens, L1PPTDTTTFKRI11P, T7PFKRIFLKRMP17P, I11PFLKRMPSIRESLKER26P, M16PPSIRESLKER26P, and G27PVDMARLGPEWSQPM41P, was designed from the tertiary structure of predicted prorenin. These antibodies were labeled anti-01/06, anti-07/10, anti-11/26, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41, respectively, for their binding specificities. Inactive recombinant human prorenin (0.1 nM) bound to various concentrations of anti-01/06, anti-11/26, and anti-27/41 antibodies at 4 °C with equilibrium dissociation constants of 138, 41, and 22 nM, respectively. However, intact prorenin (0.1 nM) did not show significant binding to 200 nM anti-07/10 and anti-16/26 antibodies for 20 h. Ninety percent of prorenin (0.1 nM) was found to be non-proteolytically activated by incubation with anti-11/26 antibodies (200 nM) at 4 °C for 20 h. Prorenin was not active even under complex with either anti-01/06 or anti-27/41 antibodies. Prorenin was also reversibly activated at pH 3.3 and 4 °C for 25 h. The acid-activated prorenin bound to anti-07/10 and anti-16/26 antibodies as well as to anti-01/06, anti-11/15, and anti-27/41 antibodies at neutral pH and 4 °C in 2 h. Their dissociation constants were 13, 40, 8.6, 3.6, and 14 nM, respectively. The acid-activated prorenin was re-inactivated by incubation at pH 7.4 and 4 °C in 50 h. Anti-07/10 and anti-11/26 antibodies inhibited such re-inactivation at 25 °C by more than 90% and 50%, respectively, whereas other kinds of antibodies did not prevent the re-inactivation at 25 °C. These results indicate that prorenin has “gate” (T7PFKR10P) and “handle” (I11PFLKR15P) regions critical for its non-proteolytic activation.

Prorenin is the inactive precursor of renin (EC 3.4.23.15), which is a key enzyme in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. Prorenin has a prosegment with 43 residues attached to the N terminus of mature renin with 339–341 residues (1Fukamizu A. Nishi K. Cho T. Saitoh M. Nakayama K. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Murakami K. J.

The prosegment has been considered to associate with mature renin to prevent interaction with angiotensinogen, its macromolecular renin substrate (5Baxter J.D. James M.N. Chu W.N. Duncan K.

However, much information regarding prorenin is unclear or lacking. The intrinsic activation enzyme, the activation mechanism in vivo, and its physiological role and source in the circulation remain unknown.

We recently showed that specific antibodies to the prosegment (L1PPTDTTTFKRIFLKR15P) activated human prorenin non-proteolytically (23Suzuki F. Hatano Y. Nakagawa T. Terazawa K. Gotoh A. Nasir U.M. Ishida Y. Nakamura Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). More recently, a renin/prorenin receptor was found in several tissues with nonproteolytically activated renin as well as prorenin (24Nguyen G. Delarue F. Burckle C. Bouzhir L. Giller T. Sraer J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). These non-proteolytic activations have generally been thought to arise from a conformational change of the prorenin molecule in vivo. The inactivation mechanism for prorenin has been reported using recombinant prorenins mutated at single to triple residues in the prosegment that formed ionic bonds (25Derkx F.H. Deinum J.

Advanced research on the role of the prosegment in the non-proteolytic activation of prorenin may provide clues to solving those problems. Recently, we found that the acid activation rate of rat prorenin was less than one-fifth of that of human prorenin (4Suzuki F. Tanaka N. Takeuchi K. Muramoto Y. Inagami T. Murakami K. Nakamura Y. Takahashi K. Aspartic Proteinases. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1995: 267-272Google Scholar), and the speed of this process was only dependent on the amino acid sequence in the prosegment with 43 amino acid residues (28Suzuki F. Nakagawa T. Kakidachi H. Murakami K. Inagami T. Nakamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results led to our working hypothesis that there was an essential region in the N-terminal side of the prosegment for non-proteolytic activation of prorenin. In this study, we propose a hypothesis that there are two key regions, “gate” and “handle,” in prorenin non-proteolytic activation using several kinds of prorenin-specific antibodies. Designation of Antigen Peptides—Antigen peptides in several regions of the prorenin prosegment were designed on the basis of the primary structure of the prosegment and the stereo structure of human prorenin predicted by the homology modeling method, as shown in Fig. 1. Preparations of Several Kinds of Anti-prorenin Prosegment Antibodies—Each of the anti-prosegment antisera was raised against a peptide, L1PPTDTTTFKRI11P-C, T7PFKRIFLKRMP17P-C, I11PFLKRMPSIRESLKER26P-C, M16PPSIRESLKER26P-C, or G27PVDMARLGPEWSQPM41P-C, conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin in rabbits. Each of the peptides was also used for the titer test of the antiserum using a commercial kit (Vectastatin ABC-AP rabbit IgG kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and the ligand of affinity column for purification of each of the antibodies. High titer antisera were obtained 6 weeks after the first immunization. Each of the affinity gels was prepared by conjugation of Biogel 102 (amine coupled gel; Bio-Rad) through a cysteine residue of antigen peptide L1PPTDTTTFKRI11P-C, T7PFKRIFLKRMP17P-C, I11P-FLKRMPSIRESLKER26P-C, M16PPSIRESLKER26P-C, or G27PVDMARLGPEWSQPM41P-C as a ligand. With these affinity columns, each of the antibodies was purified and stored at –80 °C until use. The concentration of each of the purified antibodies was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 1.35 at 1 mg/ml IgG and 280 nm (29Little J.R. Donahue H. Methods of Immunology and Immunochemistry. Academic Press, New York1967Google Scholar). Epitope Mapping of Each Purified Antibodies by a Set of Affinity Gels with Their Antigen Peptide as a Ligand—Each of the affinity gels (50 μl) was incubated with the 32 nm of the antibodies (25 μl) and protein A-horseradish peroxidase (25 μl; 1:30,000 dilution; Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle shaking. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed with 450 μl of phosphate-buffered saline three times and incubated with 100 μl of 55 mm 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and 50 μl of 0.01% H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 2 m H2SO4. The absorbance of each of the final solutions was measured at 450 nm. The cross-reactivity of five kinds of antibodies to five antigen peptides was examined by comparison of their binding ability to these affinity gels under these assay conditions, as shown in Fig. 2. These antibodies were labeled anti-01/06, anti-07/10, anti-11/26, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41, respectively, by their binding specificities. Determination of Dissociation Constant of Anti-prorenin Antibodies· Prorenin Complexes—To separate prorenin bound to each of the antibodies from the unbound prorenin fraction, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B gel (Amersham Biosciences) was suspended for 1 min at 4 °Cin50 μl of the reaction mixture of prorenin (0.1 nm) at various concentrations (2, 6, 20, 60, and 200 nm as IgG) of each of the antibodies (anti-01/06, anti-07/10, anti-11/26, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41) for 20 h (for inactive prorenin) or 2 h (for acid-activated prorenin), after which the suspension was centrifuged. The renin activity in the supernatant containing unbound prorenin was measured after trypsin treatment. The percentage of prorenin bound to the IgG was defined in the following equation: B(%)={[Ab]/([Ab]+KD)}×100(Eq. 1) where B (%) equals the percentage of prorenin bound to IgG in the total amount of prorenin, [Ab] is the concentration (nm) of IgG, and KD is the dissociation constant of prorenin-IgG complex. Kinetic Analysis of Prorenin Activation by Anti-11/26 Antibodies— Prorenin was reported to make two inactive forms at neutral pH by Derkx et al. (25Derkx F.H. Deinum J. Lipovski M. Verhaar M. Fischli W. Schalekamp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22837-22842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One was a closed form, whereas the other was an intermediately open form inactive. In this study, we also assumed that anti-11/26 antibodies bound not to the closed form (Prenc), but to the intermediately open form inactive (Prenoi), and that prorenin was completely activated under the complex is shown in the following reaction sequence. Ka and Kb are defined as follows: Kb=[Prenoi]·[Ab]/[Prenoi·Ab](Eq. 2) Ka=[Prenc]/[Prenoi](Eq. 3) [Prenc], [Prenoi], [Ab], and [Prenoi·Ab] are the concentrations of Prenc, Prenoi, antibodies, and Prenoi·antibody complex. The renin activity obtained in this study is equivalent to [Prenoi·Ab]. The anticipated reaction leads to the following equation. −d[Pren]/dt=[Prenoi·Ab]·kmax(Eq. 4) [Pren] is defined as follows: [Pren]=[Prenc]+[Prenoi]+[Prenoi·Ab](Eq. 5) On the basis of Eqs. 2, 3, and 5, [Prenoi·Ab] is expressed as follows. [Prenoi·Ab]=[Ab]/Kb1+1/Ka+[Ab]/Kb·[Pren](Eq. 6) The solution of Eq. 4 is [PR]t=[Pren]oe−Akmaxt(Eq. 7) in which A=[Ab]/Kb1+1/Ka+[Ab]/Kb (Eq. 8) and [PR]t and [Pren]o are the concentrations of Pren at t = t and t = 0, respectively. From Eqs. 7 and 8, it follows that kobs=[Ab]/Kb1+1/Ka+[Ab]/Kb·kmax(Eq. 9) or 1kobs=Kb(1+1/Ka)kmax·1[Ab]+1kmax (Eq. 10) in which kobs is the observed first-order rate constant for Preno· Ab complex. By plotting 1/kobs on the y axis against 1/[Ab] on the x axis, a straight line is obtained intersecting the x axis at –1/[Kb(1 + 1/Ka)] and the y axis at 1/kmax. Assuming the KD obtained by the other method in this study (Eq. 1) is the same as Kb, Ka was calculated from this plot. Non-proteolytic Activation of Prorenin by Specific Antibodies—The prorenin preparation was stored at –80 °C before use and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to avoid cryo-activation of the prorenin. By this treatment, the inactive level of prorenin in each preparation was synchronized at less than 2% of its total potential activity obtained by the trypsin treatment. The prorenin preparation (0.1 nm prorenin) was incubated with 200 nm of each antibody (anti-01/06, anti-07/10, anti-11/26, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41), and then the renin activity in each aliquot was determined under the standard assay conditions. Non-proteolytic Activation of Prorenin at Acidic pH—The prorenin preparation was acidified for 25 h at pH 3.3 and 4 °C in the presence of 5 mm EDTA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin treated thermally, after which the renin activity was determined by standard assay conditions. Prorenin was activated by 80% through this treatment and was used as the acid-activated prorenin in this study. Blunting Re-inactivation of Acid-activated Prorenin by Antibodies— The 0.1 nm acid-activated prorenin, which had an 80% trypsin-activated activity level, was incubated at pH 7.4 and 25 °C for 2, 25, and 50 h with 200 nm of each of the antibodies (anti-01/06, anti-07/10, anti-11/26, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41), and then the renin activity was measured in each aliquot under standard assay conditions. Proteolytic Activation of Prorenin by Trypsin—Next, 100 μl of the prorenin preparation was incubated with 5 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 2 min at 25 °C. The trypsin action was stopped by adding 10 μl of 2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (type I-S; Sigma). By this treatment, 0.1 nm human prorenin was activated to a plateau level. Determination of Prorenin Concentration—A conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells harboring human renin cDNA was used as a recombinant human prorenin source (30Poorman R.A. Palermo D.P. Post L.E. Murakami K. Kinner J.H. Smith C.W. Reardon I. Heinrikson R.L. Proteins. 1986; 1: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This cultured medium was dialyzed against 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm EDTA and 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate. This dialysate was stored in 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at –80 °C as the prorenin preparation. The prorenin concentration was measured at 80 ng/ml by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human renin, as described previously after the trypsin treatment. Determination of Renin Activity—Prorenin activated by the antibodies, either by the acidic or trypsin treatment, was incubated with 0.8 μm recombinant sheep angiotensinogen in the presence of 10 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate and 10 mm EDTA at pH 6.5 and 37 °C for 20 min, and the Ang 1The abbreviation used is: Ang, angiotensin. I generated was assayed by Ang I enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The renin activity was expressed as the amount of Ang I generated for 1 h of incubation with 1 ml of the original prorenin preparation. Antibodies Binding to Inactive and Acid-activated Prorenin—Inactive prorenin (0.1 nM) bound to 2, 6, 20, 60, and 200 nM anti-01/06, anti-11/26, and anti-27/41 antibodies at 4 °C (Fig. 3). The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for these complexes were 138, 41, and 22 nM, respectively. The inactive prorenin insignificantly associated with anti-07/10 and anti-16/26 antibodies under the present study conditions (Fig. 3). The inactive recombinant prorenin was activated to have an 80% trypsin-activated activity level by incubation at pH 3.3 and 4 °C for 25 h. The acid-activated prorenin (0.1 nM) bound to 2, 6, 20, 60, and 200 nM anti-01/06, anti-07/10, anti-11/26, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41 antibodies, respectively (Fig. 4). The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for their complexes were 8.6, 13, 3.6, 40, and 14 nM, respectively. Non-proteolytic Activation of Prorenin by Specific Antibodies—Inactive prorenin (0.1 nM) was clearly activated by incubation with 2, 6, 20, 60, and 200 nM anti-11/26 antibodies at 4 °C for 20 h (Fig. 5). More than 90% of prorenin was activated by 200 nM of the antibodies. Prorenin was slightly activated up to the 20% level by the anti-01/06 antibodies. There was insignificant activation by the anti-27/41 antibodies, although inactive and acid-activated prorenins could easily bind to them. Inactive prorenin (0.1 nM) was incubated with anti-11/26 antibodies at 4 °C for 0, 1, 2, 3.5, 5, 8, 16, and 24 h to observe the time dependence for making a complex and activation of prorenin with 200 nM anti-11/26 antibodies (Fig. 6). Both levels increased at the same rate and reached 50% and 90% in 4 and 15 h, respectively. Inactive prorenin (0.1 nM) was incubated with anti-11/26 antibodies at 4 °C for 0, 1, 2, 3.5, 5, 8, 16, and 24 h to observe the time dependence and kinetics for activation of prorenin with 6, 20, 60, 200, and 600 nM anti-11/26 antibodies (Fig. 7A). The initial rate of the activation increased with the dose of the antibodies. From the x intercept and y intercept, kmax and Kb(1 + 1/Ka) were calculated at 0.25 h–1 and 60 nM, respectively (Fig. 7B). Blunting Re-inactivation of Acid-activated Prorenin by Specific Antibodies—More than 90% of the acid-activated prorenin was re-inactivated by incubation at pH 7.4 and 4 °C within 24 h (Fig. 8). To examine whether antibodies prepared in this study block such re-inactivation, renin activity was measured in the acid-activated prorenin preparation after incubation with anti-01/06, anti-07/10, anti-11/26, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41 antibodies for 2, 25, and 50 h. The anti-01/06, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41 antibodies did not prevent the re-inactivation, as shown in Fig. 8. The anti-11/26 antibodies inhibited the reinactivation by 50% in 50 h. The anti-07/10 antibodies sustained an activity level of more than 90%, even after 50 h of incubation. Prorenin has been considered to be activated in vivo proteolytically and/or non-proteolytically in many published reports (3Morris B.J. J.

In this study, we demonstrated in vitro the “gate” and “handle” regions in the prorenin molecule crucial for its non-proteolytic activation by a protein-protein interaction and proposed a possible mechanism for its non-proteolytic activation in vivo. Inactive prorenin could not bind to anti-07/10 and anti-16/26 antibodies but associated with anti-01/06, anti-11/26, and anti-27/41 antibodies (Fig. 3). However, acid-activated prorenin made complexes with all of them (Fig. 4). The affinity of prorenin to anti-01/06 and anti-11/26 antibodies significantly increased more than 10 times after the acidification, but no significant change was observed in its affinity to anti-27/41 antibodies (Figs. 3 and 4). It is well known that the acidification of prorenin locally changes its conformation to open an active site (17Sealey J.E. Laragh J.H. Circ. Res. 1975; 36–37: I-10-I-16Google Scholar, 18Derkx F.H. von Gool J.M. Wenting G.J. Verhoeven R.P. Man in't V. eld A.J.

Biol. 1998; 436: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that the acid activation rate depended only on the amino acid sequence of prorenin prosegment (28Suzuki F. Nakagawa T. Kakidachi H. Murakami K. Inagami T. Nakamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and that inactive human prorenin was activated by anti-01/15 antibodies (pf#1 antibodies) (23Suzuki F. Hatano Y. Nakagawa T. Terazawa K. Gotoh A. Nasir U.M. Ishida Y. Nakamura Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the antibodies that remarkably decreased the KD after the acidification of prorenin should be considered the candidates for prorenin activators. In fact, anti-11/26 antibodies was found to activate prorenin significantly in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figs. 5, 6, 7), whereas anti-01/06 and anti-27/41 antibodies did not contribute to such activation, even when bound to it (Figs. 3 and 5). The regions T7PFKR10P and M16PPSIRESLKER26P were therefore closely associated in some regions with renin and/or prorenin molecule, so as to block the prorenin activation. The region I11P FLKR15P, which bound not to anti-16/26 but to anti-11/26 antibody, must be the key region for a non-proteolytic activation of prorenin by a protein-protein interaction. The acid treatment is thought to stimulate the protonation of amino acid residues containing carboxylate, e.g. Glu or Asp, so that the quick dissociation of the ionic bond should induce local conformational changes with slow dissociation of the hydrophobic bond at a low temperature in the prorenin molecule (17Sealey J.E. Laragh J.H. Circ. Res. 1975; 36–37: I-10-I-16Google Scholar, 18Derkx F.H. von Gool J.M. Wenting G.J. Verhoeven R.P. Man in't V. eld A.J.

Biol. 1998; 436: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Acidified prorenin was observed to reach maximum binding levels with each of the antibodies faster than inactive prorenin, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Binding of prorenin to the anti-11/26 antibodies reached an equilibrium level in 25 h (Fig. 6), although this process was achieved within 2 h for acidified prorenin. The KD for the complex of prorenin and anti-11/26 antibodies was calculated to be 40 nM by the equilibrium method. This value should be identical to the Kb in the kinetics study (Fig. 7). From the x intercept in that figure, the Ka value was estimated to be 50 pM. This Ka level is 1000 times lower than that reported by Derkx et al. (25Derkx F.H. Deinum J. Lipovski M. Verhaar M. Fischli W. Schalekamp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22837-22842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our present data suggest that prorenin has intermediately inactive forms at neutral pH. Because the anti-16/26 antibodies did not bind to inactive prorenin (Figs. 3 and 6), the region R16PMPSIRESLKER26P was thought not to interact with a prorenin activator protein such as anti-16/26 antibodies in vivo. In this study, we clearly showed that the rate-limiting step for prorenin activation was the binding of the I11PFLKR15P region to the antibodies by the protein-protein interaction. Acid activation of prorenin is thought to be reversibly and inversely dependent on temperature. The cryo-activation of prorenin should therefore be suppressed at 25 °C. As shown in Fig. 8, almost all of the acid-activated prorenin was re-inactivated in 24 h at pH 7.4. Anti-01/06, anti-16/26, and anti-27/41 antibodies had no effect on this re-inactivation of acid-activated prorenin. However, we found that the re-inactivation was inhibited by the anti-07/10 antibodies for 50 h (Fig. 8). The anti-11/26 antibodies suppressed 50% of the re-inactivation for 24 h (Fig. 8). This finding confirms that prorenin was irreversibly activated by anti-11/26 antibodies (Fig. 5). These results show that the region from 7P to 10P is essential for the inactivation of prorenin. The region from 11P to 15P probably associates with an “opener protein” such as anti-11/26 antibodies and/or prorenin receptor at physiological temperatures. Prorenin is well known to be irreversibly activated by several enzymes such as trypsin, cathepsin B, and plasmin (3Morris B.J. J. Hypertens. 1992; 10: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Hsueh W.A. Baxter J.D. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 469-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hsueh W.A. Do Y.S. Wang P.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22837-22842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activation is thought to digest the prosegment region of prorenin to release it from the renin region. These enzymes cleave the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of the basic amino acid residues. Human prorenin has Lys14P and Arg15P at the key region for non-proteolytic activation, as described above. This region must also be the target for such activation enzymes. The initial proteolysis on the carboxyl sides of Lys9P and Arg10P is probably an activation trigger of prorenin, as well as the essential region for the prorenin receptor. A prorenin/renin receptor mRNA was recently detected at high levels in the heart, brain, and placenta and at lower levels in the kidney and liver (24Nguyen G. Delarue F. Burckle C. Bouzhir L. Giller T. Sraer J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). By confocal microscopy, the receptor is seen to be localized in the mesangium of the glomeruli and in the subendothelium of the coronary and kidney arteries, associated with smooth muscle cells and co-localized with renin. It activated prorenin by non-proteolytical binding (24Nguyen G. Delarue F. Burckle C. Bouzhir L. Giller T. Sraer J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1417-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). This finding is important for the study of prorenin and the local prorenin/renin angiotensin system. If our findings in this study could be commonly applied to non-proteolytic activation of prorenin through receptor binding, then region 7PTFKR10P would probably be dissociated from the renin molecule through the association of region I11PFLKR15P with the receptor. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region in prorenin has attracted the attention of several investigators to design human renin inhibitors. Mercure et al. (27Mercure C. Thibault G.

(31Cumin F. Evin G. Fehrentz J.A. Seyer R. Castro B. Menard J. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9154-91547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that L13PKRMP17P inhibited renin activity with the 10 and 1 micromole order of Ki and K′i, respectively. Heinrikson et al. (32Heinrikson R.L. Hui J. Zurcher-Neely H. Poorman R.A. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggested that region R10PIFLK14P was essential for the reversible refolding of the prosegment that leads to prorenin inactivation. The data from the present study confirm their findings in some respects. We have shown here that regions M16PPSIRESLKER26P and T7PFKR10P were buried in the main body of the prorenin molecule. To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that region T7PFKR10P is crucial for refolding and the maintenance of the inactive state of prorenin (Fig. 8). Region I11PFLKR15P is another important region identified in this study. The Ki and K′i values for peptide L13PKRMP17P to renin (31Cumin F. Evin G. Fehrentz J.A. Seyer R. Castro B. Menard J. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9154-91547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are 10 times higher than the KD of 41 nM for the anti-11/16 antibodies to prorenin (Fig. 3). In addition, the region localizes at a space far removed from the active site in the cleft in the predicted tertiary model of prorenin (Fig. 1). Moreover, this region probably protrudes outside the main body of prorenin molecule. The re-inactivation of acid-activated prorenin was significantly inhibited by anti-11/26 and anti-07/10 antibodies (Fig. 8). Thus, region I11PFLKR15P should be another important region for prorenin refolding. In this study, we proposed that two regions, T7PFKR10P and I11PFLKR15P, referred to here as the “gate” and “handle,” respectively, are crucial for non-proteolytic activation of prorenin. The present findings thus provide important clues for further study of a novel renin-angiotensin system."
https://openalex.org/W2078112275,"Endocytic trafficking plays an important role in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. Many cell types express multiple EGFR family members (including EGFR, HER2, HER3, and/or HER4) that interact to form an array of homo- and heterodimers. Differential trafficking of these receptors should strongly affect signaling through this system by changing substrate access and heterodimerization efficiency. Because of the complexity of these dynamic processes, we used a quantitative and computational model to understand their integrated operation. Parameters characterizing EGFR and HER2 interactions were determined using experimental data obtained from mammary epithelial cells constructed to express different levels of HER2, enabling us to estimate receptor-specific internalization rate constants and dimer uncoupling rate constants. Significant novel results obtained from this work are as follows: first, that EGFR homodimerization and EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization occur with comparable affinities; second, that EGFR/HER2 heterodimers traffic as single entities. Furthermore, model predictions of the relationship of HER2 expression levels to consequent distribution of EGFR homodimers and EGFR/HER2 heterodimers suggest that the levels of HER2 found on normal cells are barely at the threshold necessary to drive efficient heterodimerization. Thus, altering HER2 concentrations, either overall or local, could provide an effective mechanism for regulating EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization and may explain why HER2 overexpression found in some cancers has such a profound effect on cell physiology.

In the EGFR 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; mAb, monoclonal antibody. family, endocytic trafficking processes can strongly influence cell responses to EGF family ligands. Many cell types express multiple EGFR family members that can interact to form an array of homo- and heterodimers (1Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Google Scholar). Regulation of the distribution of these receptors among cell compartments can significantly modulate the overall signaling through this system by changing access to heterodimerization partners. Because of the potential complexity of EGFR family interactions associated with concomitant receptor trafficking and signaling, application of quantitative experimental and computational modeling techniques to its analysis should be very useful. The EGFR family (EGFR/HER1/ErbB-1, HER2/ErbB-2/neu, HER3/ErbB-3, and HER4/ErbB-4) of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of four highly related receptors each with a unique set of functional properties. Following ligand binding, EGFR family receptors interact to form an array of homo- and heterodimers each with a characteristic repertoire of downstream signaling molecules (1Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Google Scholar). EGFR and HER2 are by far the most studied and have gained particular attention in the process of tumorigenesis. HER2 is commonly postulated to be the “preferred dimerization partner” of all EGFR family receptors (2Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Google Scholar, 3Qian X. LeVea C.M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1500-1504Google Scholar, 4Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Google Scholar). HER2 behaves much like a receptor subunit, as it binds none of the eight reported EGF family ligands (EGF, transforming growth factor-α, betacellulin, amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF, epiregulin, and the neuregulins (NRG and NRG-2)) with high affinity (5Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Google Scholar). Overexpression of both the EGFR and HER2 has been associated with cell transformation and tumorigenesis. HER2 is overexpressed in 25–30% of all breast and ovarian cancers and is emerging as an important player in many other cancers as well (6Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Google Scholar). HER2 overexpression correlates with poor prognoses in breast cancer (7Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Google Scholar), and its effects in the process of tumorigenesis have been fairly well documented. Increased HER2 expression contributes to cell transformation, anchorage-independent cell growth, increased proliferation and mitogenic sensitivity, as well as increased tumor cell migration and invasiveness (8DiFiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Google Scholar, 9Yu D. Hung M.-C. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 673-680Google Scholar, 10Spencer K.S.R. Graus-Porta D. Leng J. Hynes N. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 385-397Google Scholar, 11Brandt B.H. Roetger A. Dittmar T. Nikolia G. Seeling M. Merschjann A. Nofer J.-R. Dehmer-Moller G. Junker R. Assmann G. Zaenker K. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1939-1950Google Scholar). Receptor overexpression could potentially influence cell behavior in multiple ways. The presence of excess receptors could recruit additional signaling molecules, resulting in an increase in signal amplitude. Alternatively, excess receptors could saturate and interfere with processes involved in receptor down-regulation and signal attenuation (12French A.R. Sudlow G.P. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15749-15755Google Scholar, 13Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Google Scholar). This second phenomenon is a receptor trafficking effect that may affect the duration of the signaling by interfering with receptor degradation and ligand dissociation. Studies have shown that trafficking defects in receptors can facilitate cell transformation (14Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Google Scholar), suggesting that signal duration may be more of a determining factor in mitogenic sensitivity than signal amplitude, particularly at physiological ligand concentrations. It appears likely that receptor expression levels are directly connected to their trafficking behavior which, in turn, affects signaling. The trafficking behavior of the EGFR, in the absence of other family members, has been well characterized (15Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Google Scholar, 16Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1993: 73-132Google Scholar). Binding of EGFR ligands to the EGFR promotes receptor homodimerization and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine residues that initiate signaling cascades (5Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Google Scholar, 17van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Google Scholar). Phosphorylated receptors are rapidly internalized by clathrin-coated pit endocytosis resulting in both short and long term loss of receptor activity. Once internalized, receptors and ligands are sorted in endosomes and either targeted toward lysosomal degradation or follow the recycling pathway back to the surface (16Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1993: 73-132Google Scholar, 17van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Google Scholar, 18Sorkin A. Waters C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Google Scholar). Ligand-induced degradation of receptors can be impaired both at the level of endocytosis and/or endosomal sorting. Disruption of endocytosis has been shown to increase EGF-dependent proliferation (14Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Google Scholar). Overexpression of EGFR has also been shown to impair their degradation. Endocytic and endosomal sorting machinery have both been shown to exhibit saturation at high receptor levels, apparently due to limiting levels of the regulatory molecules involved in these processes (12French A.R. Sudlow G.P. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15749-15755Google Scholar, 13Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Google Scholar, 18Sorkin A. Waters C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Google Scholar, 19Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Google Scholar). The association of HER2 with a number of different pathologies could be due to a host of molecular level effects. Following dimerization with another (ligand-bound) EGFR family member, HER2 becomes phosphorylated and is then able to recruit a distinct repertoire of signaling molecules including effectors both overlapping and distinct from EGFR-associated ones (1Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Google Scholar). In addition to the signal amplification role played by HER2, a second effect is elicited at the level of trafficking. Overexpression of HER2 affects the normal trafficking behavior of the EGFR, disrupting the processes that control receptor degradation (20Worthylake R. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8865-8874Google Scholar). The precise trafficking behavior of HER2 remains unclear. The internalization rates of HER2, HER3, and HER4 have been studied through the construction of chimeras consisting of the EGFR extracellular domain and different HER cytoplasmic domains. All EGFR/ErbB chimeras are internalized severalfold more slowly than the EGFR (21Sorkin A. DiFiore P.P. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3021-3028Google Scholar, 22Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. DiFiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Google Scholar, 23Muthuswamy S. Gilman M. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6845-6957Google Scholar). EGF-induced HER2 down-regulation has also been reported (20Worthylake R. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8865-8874Google Scholar). However, other investigators have failed to observe any EGF-induced HER2 internalization or EGFR/HER2 internalization (24Wang Z. Zhang L. Yeung T.K. Chen X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Google Scholar). In recent work, we have demonstrated the internalization of HER2 in the absence of EGF and its accelerated internalization following EGF stimulation (25Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that overexpression of HER2 decreases the internalization rate of EGF. A quantitative evaluation of EGFR and HER2 internalization in the context of previous literature data, however, has not been done. In this work, we examine the endocytic portion of the trafficking pathway in detail with the aim of quantitatively understanding how EGFR and HER2 interact in the process of internalization. We found the following: (i) EGFR/HER2 heterodimers are internalized as single entities, with other models of internalization being inconsistent with literature data (25Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137Google Scholar); (ii) EGFR/HER2 heterodimers have a comparable dimerization affinity as EGFR/EGFR homodimers, thus the notion of HER2 as a preferred dimerization partner should be re-assessed; and (iii) there appears to be a threshold level of HER2 above which heterodimerization is maximal but increased HER2 expression is still able to alter signaling through longer term effects.

The human mammary epithelial cell lines MTSV1–7 and ce2 have been described previously (29D'Souza B. Berdichevsky F. Kyprianou N. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1797-1806Google Scholar) and were provided as a generous gift from Dr. Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou. These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories) containing 10% calf serum (Hyclone) supplemented with 1 μm insulin and 5 μm dexamethasone. ErbB-2 expression in ce2 cells was maintained by the addition of 500 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Antibodies and EGF were iodinated with IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions to specific activities of 2.7 × 106 cpm/pmol (mAb), 8 × 105 cpm/pmol for the Fab fragment of 7C2, and 1.6 × 106 cpm/pmol for EGF. Binding Analysis—Numbers of EGFR and HER2 molecules on the cell surface were determined by steady state analysis (30Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1981; 25: 433-440Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with concentrations from 6.7 × 10–11 to 2 × 10–8m for 3.5 h at 37 °C. The relative amount of antibody associated with the cell surface was determined by acid stripping, and the data were analyzed as described previously (20Worthylake R. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8865-8874Google Scholar). Specific internalization rates (ke) for the EGFR were determined as described (31Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Google Scholar) using 17 nm ligand and a 5-min incubation period. Specific internalization rates for the labeled mAbs were determined using a concentration of 1.3 nm antibody and 2-min intervals for a total of 10 min. Values were calculated as regression slope of the integral surface-associated ligand against the amount internalized (31Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Google Scholar). Constitutive Case—Our model was designed to output results that can be compared with the internalization experiments used to generate the data (25Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137Google Scholar, 31Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Google Scholar, 32Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Google Scholar). The constitutive internalization of EGFR and HER2 is modeled with a set of coupled mass action kinetic equations. Consistent with published reports, we assume that a constitutive level of EGFR and HER2 homo- and heterodimerization takes place (33Penuel E. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28468-28473Google Scholar, 34Mendrola J.M. Berger M.B. King M.C. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4704-4712Google Scholar, 35Yu X. Sharma K.D. Takahashi T. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2547-2557Google Scholar). As diagrammed in Fig. 1 (in the absence of any stimulation), EGFRs are allowed three states: free EGFR (R1), homodimerized with another EGFR (R1R1), or heterodimerized with HER2 (R1R2). HER2 is allowed similar freedom: free HER2 (R2), homodimerized with another HER2 (R2R2), or heterodimerized with EGFR (R1R2). The behavior of each species with regard to internalization is characterized by an internalization rate constant. Each dimerization and uncoupling act is characterized by its own, but not necessarily unique, kinetic rate constant. Ligand-stimulated Case—By using the constitutive internalization model as a basis, ligand-induced interactions were added (diagrammed in Fig. 1). We have included the complete set of binary interactions between the EGFR and HER2 with and without EGF. Higher order oligomerization of receptors is neglected, as this is a first approximation of possible EGF/EGFR/HER2 interactions. Additionally, HER3 and HER4 were left out of our analysis because we were examining the effects of EGF stimulation and they are typically expressed at lower levels. In addition to the constitutive receptor species (R1, R1R1, R1R2, R2, and R2R2) and their interactions, EGFRs now bind ligand (L) to form complexes (R1L). Complexes may homodimerize with another complex to form doubly bound EGFR homodimers (LR1R1L) or heterodimerize with HER2 to form EGF·EGFR/HER2 heterodimers (R1R2L). Additionally, the existence of singly bound EGFR homodimers (R1R1L) is permitted, and each species may be formed in any order. For example, singly bound EGFR homodimers can be formed by ligand dissociation from doubly bound EGFR homodimers or by ligand binding to unbound EGFR homodimers or by dimerization of an empty EGFR with an EGF·EGFR complex. As before, each receptor species may have a unique internalization rate constant, and every interaction is reversible with its own set of kinetic rate constants. Superimposed on the surface level receptor interactions are two additional processes: (i) the binding of radiolabeled antibodies to HER2, corresponding to the actual experiment; and (ii) the internalization of each receptor species. Under resting conditions, each receptor species is assumed to be at steady state, wherein rates of receptor internalization are perfectly balanced by rates of receptor synthesis and degradation. Thus, internalization and recycling of unlabeled receptor species can be left out of the model. Receptor species that have been bound by EGF, an antibody or antibody Fab fragment, however, are internalized at a rate specific to each species to an inside compartment. Recycling of each species is assumed to be negligible over the 7.5-min time scale of the model/experiment (30Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1981; 25: 433-440Google Scholar). Inside and surface data are generated with the model and manipulated in the same manner as the experimental data to calculate the observed internalization rate constants for specific EGFR and HER2 expression levels. The model parameters are list in Table I. The overall observed internalization rate for EGF or Fab-bound species is essentially a weighted sum of the individual internalization rate of each EGF- or Fab-bound receptor species. Model equations corresponding to the interactions diagrammed in Fig. 1 with Fab binding superimposed are listed under the Appendix of the Supplemental Material.Table IInternalization model parametersModel parameterDescriptionValueBinding parameterskonEGF association9.7 × 107 (M min)-1koffEGF dissociation0.24 min-1konFabFab association1.4 × 107 (M min)-1koffFabFab dissociation0.30 min-1Internalization rate constants (estimated from experimental data)keR1Unoccupied EGFR internalization rate constant0.08 min-1keR2-HER2 internalization rate constant, No EGF0.01 min-1keR2+HER2 internalization rate constant, + EGF0.03 min-1keR1R2EGFR/HER2 unbound heterodimer internalization rate constant0.04 min-1keR1LEGF·EGFR complex internalization rate constant0.28 min-1keR1R2LEGF·EGFR/HER2 bound heterodimer internalization rate constant0.10 min-1Dimerization/uncoupling parameters (fit to experimental data)kcaSet to diffusion-limited value.Receptor dimerization rate constant1 × 10-3 (#/cell min)-1kuR1R1EGFR/EGFR unbound homodimer uncoupling rate constant10 min-1kuR1R2EGFR/HER2 unbound heterodimer uncoupling rate constant10 min-1kuR2R2HER2/HER2 homodimer uncoupling rate constant1 min-1kuR1R2LEGF·EGFR/HER2 bound heterodimer uncoupling rate constant0.1 min-1kuLR1R1LEGF·EGFR/EGFR·EGF homodimer uncoupling rate constant0.1 min-1a Set to diffusion-limited value. Open table in a new tab Parameter Estimation and Determination—The model parameters can be divided into three categories: (i) binding parameters, which govern EGF and antibody binding and dissociation; (ii) internalization rate constants, which describe the internalization rate of each receptor species; and (iii) dimerization rate constants, which characterize the dimerization and uncoupling of EGFR and HER2 in various states. In the case of our experiments, we used Fab fragments of anti-HER2 antibodies. Fab binding (konFab) and dissociation (koffFab) were experimentally measured to be 1.4 × 107 (m min)–1 and 0.30 min–1 (data not shown). As suggested in the literature, Fab binding was assumed to have no effect on receptor dimerization/uncoupling, EGF binding/dissociation, or receptor internalization. EGF binding (kon) and dissociation (koff) for 184A1 human mammary epithelial cells were reported to be 9.7 × 107 (m min)–1 and 0.24 (min)–1, respectively (25Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137Google Scholar). Many of the species-specific internalization rate constants can be estimated from the experimental data. If one assumes that free HER2 and HER2 homodimers internalize at the same rate, their internalization rate constant should be reflected by the case where HER2 expression is much greater than EGFR expression. In the absence of EGF, the internalization rate constant of free HER2 (keR2–) is reflected by the asymptote approached at high HER2 expression levels (0.01 min–1), approximately the rate of membrane turnover (36Burke P.M. Wiley H.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 448-460Google Scholar). In the presence of EGF, there is an increase in membrane turnover, and the internalization rate of free HER2 (keR2+) is roughly 0.03 min–1. The internalization rate of free EGFR (keR1) has been reported to be 0.08 min–1 (25Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137Google Scholar). As with HER2, we assume that unbound EGFR homodimers internalize with the same rate constant as free EGFR. Unbound EGFR/HER2 heterodimers are likely to internalize at a rate between that of HER2 homodimers and EGFR homodimers. We estimate the internalization rate constant of unligated EGFR/HER2 heterodimers (keR1R2) to be 0.04 min–1. The internalization rates of EGF·EGFR complexes, complex homodimers, and singly bound EGFR homodimers are assumed to internalize with the same first order rate constant (keR1L). This parameter represents the case where no HER2 is present and can be extrapolated to the y intercept of the graph of EGFR internalization versus HER2 expression level, yielding a value of ∼0.28 min–1. The internalization rate constant for bound EGFR/HER2 heterodimers (keR1R2L) is represented by the asymptote of EGFR internalization with increasing HER2 expression. From the EGFR internalization data, at the highest level of HER2 expression, the internalization rate constant of HER2 heterodimers is estimated to be 0.10 min–1. All receptor dimer species are estimated to form at the diffusion-limited values, with a coupling rate constant (kc) of 10–3 (n/cell min)–1 (37Shea L.D. Omann G.M. Linderman J.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2949-2959Google Scholar, 38Mahama P.A. Linderman J.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1345-1357Google Scholar). The uncoupling rate constants of each dimer species (kuR1R1, kuR1R2, and kuR2R2) were fit to the HER2 internalization data in the absence of EGF. Holding these parameters fixed, the uncoupling rate constants for EGFR complex homodimers and bound heterodimers (kuLR1R1L and kuR1R2L) were fit to the either the EGFR internalization data or the HER2 + EGF internalization data. These values are intended as order of magnitude estimates of the various uncoupling rate constants. Computations—Mathematical equations corresponding to the model described above were coded into MATLAB version 6.5 (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and solved using ODE solver ode23s. Parameters were fit to experimental data using the lsqcurvefit routine from the Optimization Toolbox. Recent work has highlighted the importance of receptor internalization in determining the distribution and induced degradation of EGFR in response to EGF stimulation (25Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137Google Scholar). HER2 has emerged as a modulator of EGFR internalization presumably through heterodimerization. Here we explored the importance of heterodimerization in the internalization of both EGFR and HER2 as a function of HER2 expression level using previously published experimental data and a computational model of EGFR and HER2 internalization. Parameter Determination from Experimental Data—Experimental data demonstrating the effect of increasing HER2 expression on the internalization rate constants of HER2 and EGF is derived from Ref. 25Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137Google Scholar and shown in Fig. 2A. In the absence of EGF, HER2 was internalized slowly at a rate comparable with membrane turnover. The addition of EGF accelerated the internalization of HER2. The internalization rate of EGF showed a marked decrease with increasing HER2 expression, whereas HER2 internalization under similar conditions showed a mild decline in internalization with increasing HER2 expression. In Fig. 2B is experimental data (25Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137Google Scholar) showing the effect of preincubation with heterodimerization-blocking antibodies (2C4) on the internalization rate constant of EGF. Blocking heterodimerization abrogated any HER2-dependent effect on EGF internalization. The significance of these results has been explored previously from a global, whole cell perspective. Here we seek to explore the mechanistic basis for these findings in order to test different models of internalization, determine which receptor species are dominant under different conditions, and elucidate which interactions dictate internalization behavior. The distribution of receptors between different signaling states (homodimers versus heterodimers, for example) should provide insight into the circumstances that contribute to aberrant cell behavior. Models of Receptor Internalization—The general framework for our internalization models is shown in Fig. 1. Every binary interaction between EGFR and HER2 with and without EGF addition is included. Individual models differ with regard to certain parameter values or assumptions regarding species-specific behavior. The first internalization model that we consider is one in which each dimer species is sufficiently stable to be internalized as a single entity, hereafter referred to as the “coupled internalization” model. This model is fit to the data by first fitting uncoupling rate constants (kuR1R1, kuR1R2, and kuR2R2) to the data in the absence of EGF. Holding those parameters fixed, the remaining uncoupling rate constants (kuLR1R1L and kuR1R2L) are fit to the EGFR data and used to predict the HER2 + EGF internalization data (shown in Fig. 2A). Nearly identical results are obtained if one fits to the HER2 + EGF data and predicts the EGFR internalization data (data not shown). The parameter values determined are shown in Table I. We simulated the effect of disrupting heterodimerization on the EGF internalization rate constant by increasing the bound heterodimer uncoupling rate constants (kuR1R2L), as shown in Fig. 2B. Model predictions are shown together with experimental data for EGF internalization in the presence of an antibody (2C4) that blocks EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization (28Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Google Scholar). An alternative model of internalization might be one in which dimer species are transiently stable so that only individual receptors and complexes are internalized. We simulated this by setting the uncoupling rate constants to sufficiently large values such that no significant degree of dimerization occurs. This model required no fitting of parameters and clearly does not capture the trends seen in the experimental data (Fig. 3A). Another possibility is a model proposed by Wang et al. (24Wang Z. Zhang L. Yeung T.K. Chen X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Google Scholar), in which they assert that heterodimers do not internalize. To simulate this model, we have set the internalization rate constant of heterodimers (keR1R2L) to zero and fit the same parameters as with the original coupled internalization model. When this"

HC-Pro is involved in different steps of the viral cycle, aphid transmission, replication, and virus cell-to-cell and systemic movement and is a suppressor of post-transcriptional gene silencing. Structural knowledge of HC-Pro is required to better understand its multiple functions. To this aim, we purified His-tagged wild-type HC-Pro and a N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔHC-Pro) from plants infected with recombinant potyviruses. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins confirmed that HC-Pro is a dimer in solution, that the N terminus is not essential for self-interaction, and that a large C-terminal domain is highly resistant to proteolysis. Two-dimensional crystals of the recombinant proteins were successfully grown on Ni2+-chelating lipid monolayers. Comparison of projection maps of negatively stained crystals revealed that HC-Pro is composed of two domains separated by a flexible constriction. Cryo-electron crystallography of ΔHC-Pro allowed us to calculate a projection map at 9-Å resolution. Our data from electron microscopy, biochemical analysis, and secondary structure predictions lead us to suggest a model for structure/function relationships in the HC-Pro protein.

The genus Potyvirus is one of the largest genera of plant RNA viruses. The potyvirus genome encodes a single polypeptide that is processed by three viral proteinases to release all viral proteins needed for the infection cycle. One of these proteins is HC-Pro (helper component proteinase). HC-Pro fulfils many functions in the viral cycle (reviewed in Refs. 1Raccah B. Huet H. Blanc S. Harris K. Duffus J.E. Smith O.P. Virus-Insect-Plant Interactions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 181-206Google Scholar and 2Urcuqui-Inchima S. Haenni A.L. Bernardi F. Virus Res. 2001; 74: 157-175Google Scholar). It was first recognized as an indispensable helper factor for virus host-to-host transmission by aphid vectors (3Thornbury D.W. Hellman G.M. Rhoads R.E. Pirone T.P. Virology. 1985; 144: 260-267Google Scholar). Later, a protease activity was found acting in cis on its own C terminus to release it from the precursor polyprotein (4Oh C.S. Carrington J.C. Virology. 1989; 173: 692-699Google Scholar). Subsequent research identified further functions of HC-Pro; it is a general enhancer of infectivity and genome amplification and is indispensable for cell-to-cell and systemic movement in the plant (5Kasschau K.D. Cronin S. Carrington J.C. Virology. 1997; 228: 251-262Google Scholar). More recently, it has been identified as a suppressor of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) 1The abbreviations used are: PTGS, post-transcriptional gene silencing; AA, amino acid(s); LMV, Lettuce mosaic virus; 2D, two-dimensional; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DOGS, dioctadecylamidoglycospermine. and virus-induced gene silencing (6Anandalakshmi R. Pruss G.J. Ge X. Marathe R. Mallory A.C. Smith T.H. Vance V.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13079-13084Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies and sequence alignments suggest that HC-Pro can be schematically divided into three regions: an N-terminal region essential for the transmission process, a C-terminal region harboring the proteinase activity, and a central region implicated in all other functions (see Fig. 1). This view is probably too simplistic, and many functions most likely overlap in the HC-Pro sequence as described below. The transmission function involves two conserved motifs. One is the N-terminal KITC motif (amino acid (AA) 52–55; numbering according to HC-Pro from Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV)) that is involved in binding to the aphid vector's stylets (7Blanc S. Ammar E.D. Garcia-Lampasona S. Dolja V.V. Llave C. Baker J. Pirone T.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 3119-3122Google Scholar). The other is the C-terminal PTK motif (AA 310–312) that probably contributes to binding of HC-Pro to the viral capsid protein's N-terminal DAG motif (8Blanc S. Lopez-Moya J.J. Wang R. Garcia-Lampasona S. Thornbury D.W. Pirone T.P. Virology. 1997; 231: 141-147Google Scholar, 9Peng Y.H. Kadoury D. Gal-On A. Huet H. Wang Y. Raccah B. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 897-904Google Scholar). The DAG motif-PTK motif interaction is essential for transmission, but a second HC-Pro binding motif might exist in the capsid protein, perhaps with different functions (10Roudet-Tavert G. German-Retana S. Delaunay T. Delecolle B. Candresse T. Le Gall O. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1765-1770Google Scholar). The N-terminal ∼100 AA of HC-Pro seem to be only involved in the transmission process, because viral mutants deleted of this region are fully infectious (11Dolja V.V. Herndon K.L. Pirone T.P. Carrington J.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5968-5975Google Scholar). The proteinase domain has been mapped to the C-terminal 155 AA and characterized as a cysteine protease-like activity with Cys344 and His417 residues in the active site (4Oh C.S. Carrington J.C. Virology. 1989; 173: 692-699Google Scholar). This region might also overlap with a cell-to-cell movement domain, as in Bean common mosaic necrosis virus HC-Pro, a C-terminal deletion of 87 and 293 AA, respectively, partially or totally abolished cell-to-cell movement of heterogeneously expressed protein in microinjection studies (12Rojas M.R. Zerbini F.M. Allison R.F. Gilbertson R.L. Lucas W.J. Virology. 1997; 237: 283-295Google Scholar). The central region of HC-Pro (AA 100–300) is generally assumed to be important in genome amplification (IGN motif, AA 260–262), synergism with other viruses, and systemic movement within the host plant (CC/SC motif, AA 292–295) (5Kasschau K.D. Cronin S. Carrington J.C. Virology. 1997; 228: 251-262Google Scholar, 13Cronin S. Verchot J. Haldeman-Cahill R. Schaad M.C. Carrington J.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 549-559Google Scholar). Two domains (A and B) spanning the entire central region were described as non-specifically binding nucleic acids with a preference for single-stranded RNA. The B domain shares homology with ribonucleoproteins (14Maia I.G. Bernardi F. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 869-877Google Scholar, 15Urcuqui-Inchima S. Maia I.G. Arruda P. Haenni A.L. Bernardi F. Virology. 2000; 268: 104-111Google Scholar). Recently, HC-Pro has been recognized as a suppressor of PTGS and virus-induced gene silencing (for reviews see Refs. 16Voinnet O. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 449-459Google Scholar and 17Wan X.L. Ding S.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 150-154Google Scholar). PTGS, virus-induced gene silencing, and other RNA silencing phenomena are ancient defense mechanisms found in several eukaryotes and might constitute an alternative immune system where short interfering RNAs mediate specific degradation of aberrant RNA such as viral RNA. In plants, the phloem distributes an unidentified silencing signal throughout the plant, and as a result the whole plant suppresses expression of the concerned gene. Many plant viruses have evolved counterstrategies to knock out PTGS and encode PTGS suppressors such as HC-Pro. HC-Pro does not interfere with the mobile silencing signal but inhibits accumulation of short interfering RNA through an unknown mechanism (18Mallory A.C. Ely L. Smith T.H. Marathe R. Anandalakshmi R. Fagard M. Vaucheret H. Pruss G. Bowman L. Vance V.B. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 571-583Google Scholar). The central region of HC-Pro is implicated in suppressor activity and overlaps with the region identified for genome amplification and viral movement (19Kasschau K.D. Carrington J.C. Virology. 2001; 285: 71-81Google Scholar). Although many functions of HC-Pro have been well characterized by mutagenesis studies, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved and the links between the various activities. Size exclusion chromatography suggests that the functional HC-Pro in transmission is a dimer or trimer (3Thornbury D.W. Hellman G.M. Rhoads R.E. Pirone T.P. Virology. 1985; 144: 260-267Google Scholar, 20Wang R.Y. Pirone T.P. Phytopathology. 1999; 89: 564-567Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid experiments to test for HC-Pro self-interaction yielded somewhat confusing results. One group reported that only the N terminus is involved in HC-Pro self-interaction (21Urcuqui-Inchima S. Walter J. Drugeon G. German-Retana S. Haenni A.L. Candresse T. Bernardi F. Le Gall O. Virology. 1999; 258: 95-99Google Scholar), whereas another group identified interaction sites in both the N terminus and the C-terminal proteinase domain (22Guo D. Merits A. Saarma M. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1127-1131Google Scholar). Knowledge of the structure of HC-Pro will greatly contribute to understand its multifaceted functions and how structural domains are organized to fulfill them in concert or independently. To this aim, we analyzed the structure of HC-Pro of LMV by biochemistry and electron microscopy. We fused a histidine tag (His tag) to the N terminus of both wild-type HC-Pro and a 99-AA N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔHC-Pro) in the viral context. This strategy allowed purification of the recombinant proteins from infected plants and provided a convenient means for targeting HC-Pro to nickel-chelating lipid interfaces for electron microscopy of two-dimensional (2D) crystals (for a review see Ref. 23Kornberg R.D. Darst S.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 642-646Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis confirmed the dimeric nature of soluble HC-Pro and provided information on regions responsible for dimerization. Furthermore, 2D crystals of the two recombinant proteins were obtained and suitable for structural analysis by electron microscopy and image processing. We present here projection maps of the two negatively stained recombinant proteins and a projection structure of frozen-hydrated ΔHC-Pro at 9-Å resolution. Finally we discuss relationships between HC-Pro's structural organization and biological functions. Construction of Recombinant Viruses—Recombinant LMV-E mutants were obtained by insertion in the plasmid p70SLMVE of a His6 tag fused to the N terminus of either wild-type HC-Pro or of a deleted form (99 AA) of HC-Pro. p70SLMVE contains an infectious, full-length cDNA copy of LMV-E RNA, under the control of the enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and the NOS terminator (24Yang S.J. Revers F. Souche S. Lot H. Le Gall O. Candresse T. Dunez J. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 2443-2451Google Scholar). The resulting recombinants were designated hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro. Briefly, we introduced a SmaI site (CCCGGG) at the level of the AatII site (nucleotides 1418–1423) that corresponds to the second and third codons of the HC-Pro sequence. The resulting plasmid pLMV-E-SmaHC contains a new SmaI site surrounded by two AatII sites at the beginning of the HC-Pro coding sequence. Finally, the sequence CATCACCACCACCACCAT encoding six histidines was inserted as a double-stranded oligonucleotide in the newly created SmaI site. This yielded plasmid pLMV-E-hisHC-Pro where the viral protein P1 cleavage site necessary for liberation of HC-Pro from the polyprotein precursor is conserved. The AA sequence of the N terminus of hisHC-Pro is SDVphhhhhhgdvARN (inserted AA in italics). A similar strategy was used to clone pLMV-E-hisΔHC-Pro where the HC-Pro sequence was deleted of AA 4–102 in LMV-E-SmaHC and where the histidine-tagged deleted HC-Pro has the N-terminal AA, SDVphhhhhhgKQV. Sequencing of recombinant LMV hisΔHC-Pro RNA amplified by reverse-transcriptase PCR showed that the HC-Pro sequence of infectious hisΔHC-Pro virus recombinant contained a Gly to Ala substitution resulting in a Gly to Arg change of AA 183 (AA 285 in wild-type HC-Pro) without any effect on infectivity of the virus. Purification of HC-Pro and ΔHC-Pro—Young pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants were inoculated with the recombinant viruses as described (25German-Retana S. Candresse T. Alias E. Delbos R.P. Le Gall O. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 316-324Google Scholar). Pea leaves harboring disease symptoms characteristic of either recombinant virus were harvested 2 to 3 weeks after inoculation. They were homogenized in a blender together with 2 volumes of ST Buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm Mg2SO4, 0.5 mm EGTA) supplemented with 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Na2SO3, and 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The brei was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and one layer of miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. To concentrate the supernatant containing HC-Pro, differential precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 (20–40% for hisHC-Pro and 20–50% for hisΔHC-Pro) was carried out, and the HC-Pro-containing fraction was resuspended in ST Buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl and stored at –70 °C. Several preparations were thawed and centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 × g, the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), and 10% methanol was added. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the resin was rinsed two times for 30 min in a batch procedure with 50 ml of ST Buffer plus 500 mm NaCl and 10% methanol, followed by two washes with 50 ml of ST Buffer plus 100 mm NaCl. Then the resin was applied on a column and eluted with 5 ml of ST Buffer plus 100 mm NaCl and 500 mm imidazole. The elute was precipitated with 60% (NH4)2SO4, resuspended in ST Buffer plus 1 m NaCl (2 m for hisΔHC-Pro), and loaded on a phenyl-agarose column (Sigma) operated at room temperature. The column was washed with five volumes of the same buffer and eluted with five volumes of ST Buffer. The eluate was precipitated with 80% (NH4)2SO4, the pellet was washed two times with 80% (NH4)2SO4, and the protein was stored in 80% (NH4)2SO4 at 4 °C until use. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Purified hisHC-Pro or hisΔHC-Pro was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min before size exclusion chromatography with Ultrogel AcA 34 resin in a XK70 column (Amersham Biosciences). The running buffer was ST Buffer plus 100 mm NaCl. Gel runs were carried out on an ÄKTA Prime system (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C with a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min and monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with a kit for molecular masses of 29,000–700,000 Da (Sigma). Chemical Cross-linking—5 μl of protein solution was incubated with 1 μl of 12.5 mg/ml 1,8-bis-maleimidotriethyleneglycol (Pierce) solution in N,N-dimethylformamide or with 1 μl of 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 5–60 min on ice. The reaction was quenched with 4× Laemmli buffer, the samples were boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. N,N-Dimethylformamide alone had no effect on the oligomerization state of the proteins. Limited Proteolysis—Solutions of hisHC-Pro or hisΔHC-Pro in ST Buffer plus 100 mm NaCl were incubated for the times indicated with 1.0× trypsin solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. Adding 4× Laemmli buffer and boiling of the samples for 5 min stopped the reaction before analysis of the proteins by SDS-PAGE. For N-terminal sequencing of the 32-kDa proteolysis product, we employed identical conditions, except that 0.5 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) was used for 1 μg of protein. N-terminal Sequencing—The proteolysis products were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The 32-kDa band was identified by Ponceau S staining, cut off, and extensively washed with water. N-terminal sequencing was carried out by Edman sequencing. 2D Crystallization—We obtained 2D crystals of hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro by the following method. A lipid mixture was made of the ligand lipid, DOGS-Ni-NTA, and the diluting lipid, dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, at a molar ratio of 1:1 in chloroform/methanol (9/1, v/v) and a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. 0.5 μl of the lipid mixture was spread on the surface of a drop in a Teflon well (54 μl) containing Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm MgCl2). The Teflon wells used in these experiments were designed for 2D crystallization of membrane proteins on lipid layers (26Levy D. Mosser G. Lambert O. Moeck G.S. Bald D. Rigaud J.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 127: 44-52Google Scholar). Each well was connected to a side hole allowing injection of the protein solution. After overnight incubation at room temperature in a humid chamber, 3 μl of protein solution was injected below the lipid layer, and the solution was gently stirred without perturbing the surface lipid layer. Crystallization samples were incubated at room temperature in a humid chamber. After 24 to 48 h, a holey carbon grid was deposited on the surface of the drop, and the transferred sample was negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s and then carbon-coated (27Brisson A. Bergsma-Shutter W. Oling F. Lambert O. Reviakine I. J. Growth Cryst. 1999; 196: 456-470Google Scholar). For observation of frozen-hydrated 2D crystals of hisΔHC-Pro, plane carbon-coated gold grids were placed on top of the crystallization wells and left in contact with the interface for 2 h. Excess buffer was blotted with filter paper, and the grids were frozen rapidly in liquid ethane and stored in liquid nitrogen (28Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J.J. Homo J.C. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy and Image Analysis—Specimens were examined in a Philips CM12 electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament, operating at 120 kV. Suitable 2D crystals were imaged on Eastman Kodak Co. SO-163 film at a precalibrated electron optical magnification of ×43,750, using low dose techniques. Frozen-hydrated specimens were imaged using a Gatan 626 cryo-holder. Micrographs were developed for 12 min at 20 °C. Micrographs selected by optical diffraction were digitized at 15-μm pixel size for negatively stained specimens and 10 μm for frozen-hydrated specimens with a HI-SCAN (Eurocore). Images were processed using the MRC image processing programs (29Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Google Scholar). Briefly, the Fourier transform of each image was calculated, and the cell parameters were determined. The images were corrected for distortions of the crystal lattice by cross-correlation Fourier analysis and re-interpolation of the image (30Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Downing K.H. Lepault J. Zemlin F. Ultramicroscopy. 1986; 19: 147-178Google Scholar, 31Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Google Scholar). Amplitudes and phases were extracted using MMBOXA. The defocus and astigmatism values were first determined by CTFFIND and subsequently refined during the merging procedure. Images were corrected for the contrast transfer function using CTFAPPLY. Phase relationships between Fourier components of each crystal were examined with the program ALLSPACE (32Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 281-287Google Scholar), and the space group was determined. Comparison of the internal phase residual in all 17 space groups revealed p4 symmetry. The common origin was refined, and the contrast transfer function-corrected data was merged. The phases were rounded to either 0 or 180°, as the projection structure was centro-symmetric in this plane group. With the amplitudes and phases obtained after image processing, Fourier projection maps were calculated using the CCP4 program package (33Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis and Predictive Methods—Predictions of secondary structure of hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro were computed using the programs PHD (34Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60Google Scholar, 35Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Google Scholar), Hnn (35Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G.

SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Antibodies—SDS-PAGE was carried out using standard methods with 12% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry blotting apparatus. Bound antibodies were detected with the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) color reaction or by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For detection of HC-Pro a rabbit polyclonal antiserum was used, and for detection of His tags a commercial mouse monoclonal antibody (Euro-gentec) was used. Expression of Functional Recombinant HC-Pro—Two LMV recombinants were constructed (Fig. 1), where a His tag was inserted upstream of the wild-type HC-Pro sequence (hisHC-Pro) or of a mutant deleted of AA 4 to 102 (hisΔHC-Pro). The recombinant viruses were used to inoculate young pea (P. sativum L.) plants. The two LMV mutants were fully infectious, and plants displayed typical disease symptoms 8 to 10 days after inoculation. hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro were purified from infected plants as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2 shows that hisHC-Pro displayed a single band of the expected size of 53 kDa in SDS-PAGE whereas hisΔHC-Pro migrated consistently as a double band, one corresponding to the calculated mass of 41 kDa, the other being about 2 kDa smaller. In Western blots probed with a anti-His6 antibody, only the upper band was revealed, suggesting that hisΔHC-Pro is cleaved in planta at its N terminus. In aphid transmission tests, hisHC-Pro was active, whereas hisΔHC-Pro was inactive (data not shown). In protein overlay assays, the two HC-Pro variants interacted with the coat protein from several potyvirus species, in accordance with previous reports on HC-Pro from other potyviruses (8Blanc S. Lopez-Moya J.J. Wang R. Garcia-Lampasona S. Thornbury D.W. Pirone T.P. Virology. 1997; 231: 141-147Google Scholar, 9Peng Y.H. Kadoury D. Gal-On A. Huet H. Wang Y. Raccah B. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 897-904Google Scholar), further confirming structural integrity of the purified proteins. The N Terminus of HC-Pro Is Not Essential for Oligomerization—We subjected hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro to size exclusion chromatography to determine their native oligomerization state (Fig. 3A). hisHC-Pro eluted at a volume equivalent to 138 ± 35 kDa (four independent experiments). This corresponds to a dimer or trimer, as already reported for HC-Pro from other potyviruses (3Thornbury D.W. Hellman G.M. Rhoads R.E. Pirone T.P. Virology. 1985; 144: 260-267Google Scholar, 20Wang R.Y. Pirone T.P. Phytopathology. 1999; 89: 564-567Google Scholar). Surprisingly, hisΔHC-Pro eluted at a volume equivalent to 96 ± 11 kDa (three independent experiments), also suggestive of a dimer or trimer. This indicates that the N terminus of HC-Pro is not essential for oligomerization. The results imply that soluble hisHC-Pro as well as hisΔHC-Pro are either globular trimers or non-globular dimers. To determine more precisely the oligomeric state of soluble hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro, we subjected both proteins to chemical cross-linking with an Src homology-reactive compound, 1,8-bis-maleimidotriethyleneglycol. Fig. 3B shows that, after adding the cross-linker compound, both hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro migrated in SDS-PAGE as dimers, in addition to monomer forms. Occasionally, we also observed tetramers and higher oligomers. Experiments with lysine-reactive compounds and glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agents gave similar results (data not shown). In the case of hisΔHC-Pro, only one band corresponding to a dimer was visible instead of the three expected by random combination of the two subforms of hisΔHC-Pro. This might have been because of the poor resolution of the SDS-PAGE gels for high molecular mass proteins. HC-Pro Contains a Protease-resistant Domain—We carried out limited trypsic proteolysis of purified hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro. Fig. 4A shows that trypsin degraded hisHC-Pro to a 32-kDa peptide. This peptide was very resistant to prolonged proteolysis. Trypsin digestion of hisΔHC-Pro (Fig. 4A) also yielded a 32-kDa peptide. This indicated that the 32-kDa peptide originated from the middle or C-terminal part of the entire hisHC-Pro molecule. N-terminal sequencing of the 32-kDa peptides showed that both hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro were cleaved at AA Thr170 or Gly176 (numbering according to wild-type HC-Pro) suggesting that this stretch of the HC-Pro molecule is exposed. Chemical cross-linking of the 32-kDa peptide of hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro with glutaraldehyde revealed that the region sufficient for dimerization is contained in the C-terminal 282 AA of HC-Pro (Fig. 4B). Tetramers and higher oligomeric forms of HC-Pro were also observed as with full-length HC-Pro and ΔHC-Pro. Chemical cross-linking experiments with Src homology-reactive and lysine-reactive compounds gave similar results (data not shown). 2D Crystallization of hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro—2D crystallization of hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro was achieved after binding onto a lipid monolayer. The nickel-chelating lipid used in this study was 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)imidodiacetic acid)succinyl] (nickel salt) (DOGS-Ni-NTA). A systematic screening of crystallization conditions revealed that Mg2+ in the buffer was crucial to induce crystallization of both recombinant proteins. hisHC-Pro crystals were extremely fragile and most often broke when transferred onto plain carbon grids. Subsequently, 2D crystals were transferred onto holey carbon grids and then carbon-coated (27Brisson A. Bergsma-Shutter W. Oling F. Lambert O. Reviakine I. J. Growth Cryst. 1999; 196: 456-470Google Scholar). Fig. 5, A and B shows typical hisHC-Pro and hisΔHC-Pro 2D crystals. They had well defined edges forming step-like structures. hisHC-Pro formed large 2D crystals with 1 to 10 μm in diameter containing many defaults when examined at higher magnification. Fig. 5, C and D show a representation of the Fourier components determined from a single image. The quality of hisΔHC-Pro crystals was clearly better than that of hisHC-Pro crystals. Indeed, for hisΔHC-Pro crystals, reliable factors up to 17-Å resolution were visible in the optical diffraction pattern whereas the upper limit resolution obtained from hisHC-Pro crystals was usually comprised between 25 and 20 Å. The unit cell parameters determined from averaged images are presented in Table I. Although the molecular mass of hisΔHC-Pro is 22% smaller than that of hisHC-Pro, its unit cell is 12% larger. This certainly reflects different protein packing of hisΔHC-Pro in the crystal. Examination of the phase relationships indicated a p4 plane group for both 2D crystals (32Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol.

Merging such images leads to blurred projection maps. Thus, for a better understanding, we present projection maps calculated from single images. To better compare the projection maps, a resolution cut-off at 23 Å was applied to images of the two proteins before calculation of the final projection maps (Fig. 6). The hisHC-Pro density map presented in Fig. 6A revealed a tetrameric organization of the protein. The tetramer has a square-like shape with ∼78-Å"

PS1- and PS2-mediated activities were individually characterized using blastocyst-derived (BD) cells and membranes from PS1+/–-PS2–/– and PS1–/–PS2+/+ mice, respectively. The relative amounts of PS1 and PS2 in the various BD cells were determined from the intensities of the anti-PS1 and anti-PS2 immunoblot signals by comparison with standard curves using radiolabeled PS1 and PS2 standards produced by in vitro transcription and translation. Cellular membranes from wild type, PS1–/–PS2+/+, and PS1+/–-PS2–/– but not PS1–/–PS2–/– BD cells generated the Aβ40 and Aβ42 products from the C100FLAG substrate. PS1-associated γ-secretase displays considerably higher specific activity than PS2-associated γ-secretase. Moreover, the PS1+/–PS2–/– BD cells and corresponding membranes exhibited much higher γ-secretase activity as compared with other BD cells and membranes. The PS1-mediated γ-secretase activity correlated better with the amount of PS1 that is modifiable by a photoactivated active site-directed γ-secretase inhibitor rather than total PS1; hence, only a small portion (<14%) of the PS1 in wild-type membranes appears to be engaged in an active γ-secretase complex. This finding suggests that PS1 may serve other biological functions in addition to that associated with its γ-secretase activity. Furthermore, the PS1 γ-secretase complex and the PS2 γ-secretase complex activities can be discriminated on the basis of their susceptibility to inhibition by a potent γ-secretase inhibitor. The distinct yet overlapping enzymatic properties of the PS1 γ-secretase complex and the PS2 γ-secretase complex imply that these two putative aspartyl class proteases may contribute to different biological processes.

Presenilin-1 (PS1) 1The abbreviations used are: PS1, presenilin-1; PS2, presenilin-2; BD, blastocyst-derived; AD, Alzheimer's disease; APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, β-amyloid; TNT, transcription/translation; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; NTF, N-terminal fragment; CTF, C-terminal fragment. and presenilin-2 (PS2) are homologous (67% identity) polytopic membrane-spanning proteins that are endoproteolytically processed to form heterodimers. PS1 and PS2 were identified by their association with early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in humans. Autosomal dominant inheritance of mutations in the PS1 gene is the most common cause of familial early onset Alzheimer's disease (1Sherrington R. Rogaev E.I. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Levesque G. Ikeda M. Chi H. Lin C. Li G. Holman K. et al.Nature. 1995; 375: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (3585) Google Scholar). Familial early onset Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations are also present in PS2, although they are far less prevalent than in PS1 (2Levy Lahad E. Wasco W. Poorkaj P. Romano D.M. Oshima J. Pettingell W.H. Yu C.E. Jondro P.D. Schmidt S.D. Wang K. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). In addition to their purported role in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, the presenilins have been implicated in Notch signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, apoptosis, capacitative calcium entry (3De Strooper B. Annaert W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E221-E225Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and ErbB-4-mediated signaling (4Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Moreover, PS1 and PS2 are closely related to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, sel-12, which is involved in cell fate decisions (5Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). APP is processed by two proteases, β-secretase and γ-secretase, that generate the N and C termini of the Aβ-peptides, respectively (6Li Y.-M. Mol. Intervent. 2001; 1: 198-207PubMed Google Scholar). The Aβ-peptides are generally 40 or 42 amino acids in length (Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively). Aβ42 is more prone to aggregation and is believed to be a pivotal player in the etiology of AD. There is considerable evidence showing that the presenilins are closely associated with γ-secretase-mediated cleavage. Firstly, familial early onset Alzheimer's disease mutations in PS1 and PS2 cause increased production of Aβ42 in transfected cells or transgenic mice. Secondly, isolated cultured neurons derived from PS1-deficient mice accumulate APP fragments that fail to be processed by γ-secretase (7De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 8Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X.

Thirdly, γ-secretase activity is abolished in cultured cells derived from mice that are deficient in both PS1 and PS2 (9Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Fourthly, mutagenesis of two conserved aspartates in the transmembrane regions of PS1 significantly reduces γ-secretase activity (11Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that PS1 is either a unique diaspartyl cofactor for γ-secretase or is itself γ-secretase, an intramembranous aspartyl protease. Finally, biochemical evidence that PS1 and PS2 contain the active sites of γ-secretase was obtained from studies in which presenilins were covalently modified by active site-directed γ-secretase inhibitors (12Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) Although both PS1 and/or PS2 are essential for the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage, the dramatically different phenotypes of the PS1-deficient and PS2-deficient mice suggest that these proteins play disparate roles. The PS1-deficient mice exhibit severe developmental defects and perinatal lethality (14Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1997; 89: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 15Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Trumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H. Sisodia S.S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), whereas the PS2-deficient mice are viable and fertile and develop only mild pulmonary fibrosis and hemorrhage with increasing age (16Herreman A. Hartmann D. Annaert W. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Serneels L. Umans L. Schrijvers V. Checler F. Vanderstichele H. Baekelandt V. Dressel R. Cupers P. Huylebroeck D. Zwijsen A. Van Leuven F. De Strooper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11872-11877Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). PS1 and PS2 transcripts are present in a wide variety of mammalian tissues; however, the levels of mRNA vary significantly and independently among tissues and during brain development (17Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Martin L.J. Thinakaran G. Kim G. Gandy S.E. Seeger M. Koo E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7513-7525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The marked sequence divergence of the putative cytosolic domains in PS1 and PS2 probably enable them to interact with different perhaps overlapping intracellular binding partners. Consistent with this notion, PS1 and PS2 appear to engage in independent high molecular weight protein complexes (18Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M. St. George Hyslop P.H. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16470-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A functional redundancy between PS1 and PS2 is apparent from the ability of either protein to rescue the egg-laying defect of C. elegans hermaphrodites lacking sel-12 (5Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, the differences/similarities of the PS1 and PS2-mediated γ-secretase activities have yet to be fully elucidated. In this investigation, we aimed to compare the γ-secretase activities mediated by PS1 and PS2. Blastocyst-derived (BD) cells from wild-type, PS1–/–PS2+/+, PS1+/–PS2–/–, and PS1–/–PS2–/– mice (19Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) were used to prepare cellular membranes that were evaluated with an in vitro γ-secretase assay (20Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In addition, these BD cell lines were transiently transfected with an expression construct encoding the C-terminal fragment of APP (C-100) and the levels of secreted Aβ were measured. Importantly, the γ-secretase activities associated with the PS1+/–PS2–/– BD cells and PS1–/–PS2+/+ BD cells are mediated exclusively by the PS1 γ-secretase complex and the PS2 γ-secretase complex, respectively. This assertion is supported by the absence of γ-secretase activity associated with the PS1 and PS2 doubly deficient BD cells. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Standardization of the Reactivities of Anti-PS1 and Anti-PS2 Antibodies—Murine PS1 and PS2 cDNAs were cloned into the pSP64 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Vector DNA (1 and 2 μg of the PS1 and PS2 constructs, respectively) was heated at 75 °C for 10 min and placed on ice. The vector DNA was then added to 40 μl of TnT Quick Master mixture (Promega), 2 μl of l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.6 μl of canine microsomal membranes (Promega). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and then spun in a Microcentrifuge (14,000 rpm) for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF membrane was placed on the PhosphorImager plate for 18 h and analyzed with a Storm860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The amounts of the presenilins deduced from the phosphorimaging signals were normalized for the number of methionines in the murine PS1 and PS2 proteins. After the [35S]Met signal was assessed, the blot was rewetted and analyzed by Western analysis using rabbit anti-PS1-NTF (number 7436 raised against PS1 residues 1–25) and anti-PS2-CTF antibodies (PC235, Oncogene). Western blotting signals were detected with the Enhanced Chemifluorescent kit for the PhosphorImager. Correlation between the amounts of PS1 and PS2 with the intensities of the corresponding immunosignals was used to calculate the relative sensitivities of the activities of the PS1 and PS2 immunoblot assays. Blastocyst-derived Cultures and Cell Membranes—Blastocyst-derived cells from PS1+/+PS2+/+, PS1+/–PS2–/–, PS1–/–PS2+/+, and PS1–/–PS2–/– blastocyst cultures were obtained as described previously (10Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum and murine leukemia inhibitory factor. BD cell membranes were prepared as described previously (20Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) with the exception that the cells were broken with a Dounce homogenizer. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. Immunoblotting Analysis of the BD Cell Membranes—Cellular membranes containing PS1 and PS2 were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF membranes were probed for the presence of PS1 and PS2 with rabbit anti-PS1-NTF and rabbit anti-PS2-CTF antibodies, respectively. Western blotting signals were detected using the Enhanced Chemifluorescent kit for the PhosphorImager as described above. Methods for immunoprecipitation, in vitro γ-secretase assay, Aβ assay, and photoaffinity labeling of membrane proteins were carried out as described elsewhere (12Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). PS2 Does Not Reside in the PS1-containing γ-Secretase Complex—Our previous study (20Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) demonstrated that anti-PS1 antibody sequestered γ-secretase activity from detergent-solubilized HeLa cell membranes. Further analysis of the PS1 immunoprecipitate shows that PS2 is not present (Fig. 1). After two cycles of immunoprecipitation with anti-PS1 antibodies, there is no detectable PS1 in the supernatant, whereas the PS2 level is not changed as compared with the normal IgG control. These data establish that PS2 is not engaged in the PS1-containing complex that displays γ-secretase activity. Correlation of Anti-PS1 and Anti-PS2 Antibody Signals with Relative Protein Abundance—To more fully compare PS1- and PS2-mediated γ-secretase activities, we sought to determine the relative amounts of PS1 and PS2 in the different BD cell lines. Radiolabeled PS1 and PS2 standards were produced by in vitro transcription/translation (TNT) of the corresponding murine presenilin cDNAs in the presence of [35S]Met. The radiolabeled TNT products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Fig. 2A, upper panel, shows the phosphorimages of PVDF membranes containing increasing amounts of the radiolabeled TNT products generated with the murine PS1 and PS2 constructs. Murine PS1 and PS2 contain 13 and 17 methionines, respectively. Equal intensity of phosphorimaging signals (after normalization for the different number of methionines in PS1 and PS2) is indicative of equal amounts of protein. The very same blots containing the TNT products were also probed with the anti-PS1-NTF or anti-PS2-CTF antibodies (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The exposure time for the immunoblot signal (5 min) was much shorter than the exposure time for the [35S]Met signal (16 h, no signal was observed after3hof exposure); hence, the immunoblot signal is not corrupted by the [35S]Met signal. The intensities of the anti-PS1-NTF and anti-PS2-CTF immunoblot signals as a function of the amounts of PS1 and PS2, respectively, are depicted in Fig. 2B. We conclude that the immunoblot protocol for detection of PS2-CTF is ∼1.8-fold more sensitive than the corresponding immunoblot protocol for detection of PS1-NTF. Protein Levels of PS1 and PS2 in the BD Cells—Presenilin expression in the various BD cells was characterized by immunoblotting using anti-PS1-NTF and anti-PS2-CTF antibodies (Fig. 3A). Both PS1 and PS2 were detected in PS1+/+PS2+/+cell membranes (lanes 1 and 5, respectively). The relative amounts of PS1 and PS2 in the PS1+/+ PS2+/+ membranes were deduced by comparing each immunoreactive signal with the corresponding PS1 or PS2 immunoreactivity standard curves (Fig. 2C). Accordingly, the amount of PS2 in PS1+/+ PS2+/+ cell membranes appears to be 72% of the amount of PS1. PS1 but not PS2 was detected in PS1+/–PS2–/– membranes (lanes 2 and 6, respectively). Conversely, PS2 but not PS1 was detected in PS1–/–PS2+/+ cell membranes (lanes 3 and 7, respectively). Membranes from PS1–/–PS2–/– BD cells do not possess protein species that cross-react with either the anti-PS1-NTF or anti-PS2-CTF antibodies (lanes 4 and 8, respectively). The PS1 level in PS1+/–PS2–/– cell membranes (lane 2) was only 6% of that seen with wild-type cell membranes (lane 1) (note the 10-fold higher protein load in lane 2 compared with lane 1). The dramatically lower levels of PS1 in the PS1+/–PS2–/– cell membranes as compared with the PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes was confirmed by immunoblotting with the anti-PS1-CTF antibody (Fig. 3B). Comparative analysis of PS2 in PS1+/+PS2+/+ and PS1–/– PS2+/+ cell membranes (lanes 5 and 7, respectively) reveals a 2.6-fold greater abundance of PS2 in the PS1-deficient cells. In Vitro γ-Secretase Activity Catalyzed by BD Cell Membranes—The γ-secretase activities catalyzed by the various BD cell membranes were evaluated with the in vitro γ-secretase assay using the recombinant substrate, C100/FLAG (20Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). PS1–/–PS2–/– cell membranes fail to catalyze the formation of the 40- or 42-related cleavage products (data not shown). Importantly, this result signifies that all activity displayed by BD cell membranes using the in vitro γ-secretase assay is attributable to PS1 or PS2. Despite the limited amount of PS1 present in the PS1+/–PS2–/– cell membranes (6% of the level in PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes), the amount of total Aβ generated by these membranes was 56% of that produced by PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes (Table I). Likewise, membranes prepared from the PS1–/–PS2+/+ BD cells, which serve as a source of PS2 γ-secretase activity, catalyze the formation of the Aβ-peptides from C100/FLAG. However, total Aβ generated by PS1–/–PS2+/+ cell membranes is only 11% of that produced by PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes.Table IIn vitro and cellular γ-secretase activity of BD cell linesPS1+/+ PS2+/+PS1+/- PS2-/-PS1-/- PS2+/+Relative abundance of PSPS1 (units)[1.00]0.06PS2 (units)0.721.90MembranesaThe cell membranes toward recombinant C100/FLAG substrate.Aβ40 (pM)817 ± 52459 ± 492 ± 4Aβ42 (pM)135 ± 898 ± 112 ± 1Aβ42/total Aβ (%)141812pM Aβ/units928355Relative rate1691CellsbThe cell lines were transiently transfected with C100 fragment of APP.Aβ40 (pM)1319 ± 215502 ± 64391 ± 5Aβ42 (pM)200 ± 2947 ± 1065 ± 3Aβ42/total Aβ (%)13914Aβ/units (pM)9150240Relative rate381a The cell membranes toward recombinant C100/FLAG substrate.b The cell lines were transiently transfected with C100 fragment of APP. Open table in a new tab Assessment of the in vitro γ-secretase activities of the PS1+/–PS2–/– and PS1–/–PS2+/+ membranes coupled with the knowledge of the relative abundance of PS1 and PS2 in these membrane preparations (Fig. 3) allow estimates for the comparative enzymatic activities of the PS1 γ-secretase complex and the PS2 γ-secretase complex toward the C100/FLAG substrate (Table I). We conclude that the relative activity of the PS1 γ-secretase complex (residing in the PS1+/–PS2–/– cell membranes) is 169-fold greater than that of the PS2 γ-secretase complex (residing in the PS1–/–PS2+/+ cell membranes) when assayed with C100/FLAG. This conclusion rests on the assumption that PS1 and PS2 are fully engaged in the putative catalytically competent γ-secretase macromolecular complex in these membranes. The amount of Aβ42 generated with PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes was ∼14% total Aβ (Table I). PS1+/–PS2–/– and PS1–/–PS2+/+ cell membranes also catalyzed the formation of the Aβ40- and Aβ42-related species from C100/FLAG. The amount of Aβ42 (relative to total Aβ) produced by the PS1- and PS2-containing membranes is ∼18 and 12%, respectively. Hence, the PS1 γ-secretase complex may be slightly more proficient than the PS2 γ-secretase at catalyzing the Aβ42 cleavage event. The previously mentioned comparison of the activities of PS1 and PS2 strongly suggests that the PS1 γ-secretase complex is responsible for the bulk of the in vitro γ-secretase activity catalyzed by PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes. However, it is surprising that PS1+/+PS2+/+ and PS1+/-PS2–/– cell membranes generate comparable amounts of total Aβ (Table I) despite 16-fold more PS1 in the former cells compared with the latter cells. The apparent specific activity of the PS1 γ-secretase complex in the PS1+/–PS2–/– cell membranes thus appears to exceed the apparent specific activity of the PS1 γ-secretase complex in the PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes. Varying the amount of the PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes in the assay resulted in a proportional change in the amount of product formation (data not shown). Hence, the level of PS1 in the PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes (when assayed at 2.5 μg) does not appear to simply overwhelm the capacity of the in vitro assay to detect PS1 activity. γ-Secretase Activity Displayed by BD Cells Expressing the C-terminal Fragment of APP—The various BD cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding the APP fragment (C100) that corresponds to the membrane-bound C-terminal stub produced by β-secretase cleavage. The BD cells were exposed to the C100 expression vector for 24 h, fresh medium was placed on the cells for an additional 24 h, and the conditioned medium was removed and assayed for Aβ40 and Aβ42. The BD cells were cotransfected with a vector encoding green fluorescent protein to control for differences with respect to transfection efficiency and posttransfection cell proliferation rate. The amount of the Aβ-peptides that accumulated in conditioned media of the various transfected BD cells (after normalizing for transfection efficiency based on the green fluorescent protein levels) is shown in Table I. The PS1–/–PS2–/– BD cells fail to secrete Aβ40 or Aβ42 (data not shown), which is an observation that is consistent with previous reports (9Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Even though the level of PS1 protein in PS1+/–PS2–/– cells is only 6% of that found in PS1+/+PS2+/+ BD cells (Fig. 3A), the amounts of total Aβ secreted by the former cells is 38% of that secreted by the latter cells. The level of PS2 protein in PS1–/–PS2+/+ BD cells is 2.6-fold higher than that in PS1+/+PS2+/+ BD cells; however, the former cells secrete only 30% Aβ produced by the latter cells. The relative cellular activity of the PS1 γ-secretase complex (residing in PS1+/–PS2–/– BD cells) appears to be 38-fold greater than that of the PS2 γ-secretase complex (residing in PS1–/–PS2+/+ BD cells). These results are consistent with the studies carried out with the BD cell membranes, indicating that PS1 exhibits higher relative activity in processing the C100/FLAG substrate. Furthermore, it suggests that secreted Aβ from PS1+/+PS2+/+ cells is largely produced by PS1-mediated γ-secretase activity. The amount of Aβ42 (relative to total Aβ) secreted by PS1+/+PS2+/+ BD cells was ∼13%. The corresponding percentages of Aβ42 secreted by PS1+/–PS2–/– BD cells (exclusively PS1 cellular activity) and PS1–/–PS2+/+ BD cells (exclusively PS2 cellular activity) were ∼9 and 14%, respectively. Hence, in direct opposition to studies with the cell membranes, it appears that the PS2 γ-secretase complex in the cellular system may have a slightly greater propensity than the PS1 γ-secretase complex to catalyze the Aβ42-cleavage event. PS1-mediated γ-Secretase Activity Is Correlated with Abundance of the Photolabeled PS1 Species—The apparent low activity of PS1 in the PS1+/+PS2+/+ BD cells could result from either low specific activity of the PS1-associated γ-secretase complex or from PS1 not being fully engaged in the catalytically active γ-secretase complex. The active site-directed photoactivatable γ-secretase inhibitor, Merck A (Fig. 4), which binds to the active form of enzyme (12Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), was used as a probe to assess the catalytic competency of PS1 in the BD cell membranes. Merck A displays similar inhibitory potency toward γ-secretase activity in membranes prepared from PS1+/+-PS2+/+ and PS1+/–PS2–/– BD cells (data not shown). Equal amounts of protein from the different BD cell membranes were incubated with Merck A, and the samples were irradiated, leading to photolabeling of active γ-secretase. The biotinylated proteins were isolated with streptavidin-beads and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-PS1 and anti-PS2 antibodies (Fig. 4). No labeled species were detected when the PS1–/–PS2–/– cell membranes were treated similarly (data not shown). Moreover, the appearance of the labeled PS1 and PS2 species were blocked when the photolysis was performed in the presence of excess Merck B (data not shown). An analysis of the signals by densitometric scanning revealed 2.2 ± 0.2-fold more photolabeled PS1 in PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes than in PS1+/–PS2–/– cell membranes. Moreover, there is 2.4 ± 0.3-fold less photolabeled PS2 in PS1+/+PS2+/+ cell membranes than in PS1–/–PS2+/+ cell membranes. These data indicate that γ-secretase activity better correlates with the amount of photolabeled PS1 rather than total amount of PS1 in PS1+/+-PS2+/+ and PS1+/– PS2–/– BD cell membranes. PS1- and PS2-mediated γ-Secretase Activity Display Differential Inhibitor Susceptibility—The potent γ-secretase inhibitor, Merck B (21Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), blocked cleavage of C100/FLAG by PS1+/+ PS2+/+ BD cell membranes (Fig. 5). The IC50 value, 0.26 nm, was indistinguishable from the value that was observed with the detergent extract prepared from HeLa cell membranes (20Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The PS1-mediated γ-secretase activity catalyzed by PS1+/–PS2–/– BD cell membranes and the PS2-mediated γ-secretase activity catalyzed by PS1–/–PS2+/+ BD cell membranes were both inhibited by Merck B (IC50 values = 0.15 and 0.81 nm, respectively). Hence, the PS1 γ-secretase complex appears to be 5.4-fold more susceptible to inhibition by Merck B than is the PS2 γ-secretase complex. This apparent ability of Merck B to discriminate between PS1 and PS2 was also observed with membranes prepared from mouse embr"

Antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria is a major clinical concern because it has increased significantly during recent years, rendering antimicrobial therapy progressively less effective. One mechanism by which bacteria can escape the action of antibiotics is the production of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) 1The abbreviations used are: MBL, metallo-β-lactamase; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. or class B β-lactamases (1Ambler R.P. Daniel M. Fleming J. Hermoso J.M. Pang C. Waley S.G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 207-211Google Scholar). These enzymes were initially described as a curiosity in innocuous strains of Bacillus cereus (2Kubawara S. Abraham E.P. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 27-30Google Scholar) but were subsequently identified in several pathogenic species responsible for human infections in which the enzymes are either encoded by resident chromosomal genes or by horizontally acquired genes carried on mobile genetic elements (3Rasmussen B.A. Bush K.

Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1584-1590Google Scholar). Class B β-lactamases have a broad spectrum of substrates, including penicillin, cephalosporin, and carbapenem, some of which are not substrates for active site serine β-lactamases (3Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 223-232Google Scholar, 4Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: 48-53Google Scholar). At present no inhibitors of these enzymes are used clinically, making them a potential source of antibiotic resistance. The MBL family has been divided into three different subclasses, B1, B2, and B3, on the basis of sequence similarities (8Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J. Dideberg O. Frère J.-M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 660-663Google Scholar). MBLs have two metal binding sites (the His site, or first site, and the Cys site, or second site), which bind Zn2+ ions required for enzyme activity. In general, both the mono-Zn2+ (Zn2+ in the His site) and di-Zn2+ forms are active but have different kinetic properties (9Paul-Soto R. Hernandez-Valladares M. Galleni M. Bauer R. Zeppezauer M. Frère J.-M. Adolph H.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 137-140Google Scholar, 10Paul-Soto R. Bauer R. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H. Rossolini G.M. de Seny D. Hernandez-Valladares M. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13242-13249Google Scholar); the exception is CphA from Aeromonas hydrophilia, which is inhibited by the presence of the second zinc ion (11Hernandez-Valladares M. Felici A. Weber G. Adolph H.W. Zeppezauer M. Rossolini G.M. Amicosante G. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11534-11541Google Scholar). In the mono-Zn2+ enzyme, a water-mediated mechanism for the hydrolysis of the antibiotic β-lactam ring has been suggested in which a water molecule is activated by the presence of the Zn2+ ion in the His site, then carries out nucleophilic attack against the carbonyl carbon of the β-lactam. Residues Asp-120 and Cys-221 from the second site would help keep the active water molecule in position. Asp-120 would also act as a general base, transferring the proton from the water molecule to the nitrogen atom of the β-lactam ring, causing bond cleavage and opening of the ring, leading to inactivation of the antibiotic (12Carfi A. Parès S. Duée E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Google Scholar, 13Diaz N. Suarez D. Merz K.M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9867-9879Google Scholar). In the bi-Zn2+ enzyme, a hydroxide ion is positioned close to the two Zn2+ ions. The second Zn2+ would also help to anchor Asp-120 (14Rasia R.M. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1853-1860Google Scholar) and would orient the β-lactam ring by binding to the β-lactam nitrogen of the antibiotic (15Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Google Scholar). Although both the mono- and di-Zn2+ forms exist, it has been hypothesized that only the mono-Zn2+ form is present under normal physiological conditions (16Wommer S. Rival S. Heinz U. Galleni M.

Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of the d-Captopril Complex—The overexpression, purification, and characterization of the protein have been described (34Rossolini G.M. Franceschini N. Riccio M.L. Mercuri P.S. Perilli M. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Amicosante G. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 145-152Google Scholar). For crystallization, the hanging drop method was used. Crystals were obtained by mixing 2 μl of protein (5 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, 100 μm zinc acetate, 100 μm dithiothreitol, pH 6.5) and 1 μl of the reservoir solution (28% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4) at 8 °C; crystals appeared after approximately 3 weeks. A crystal was soaked for ∼5 weeks in previously equilibrated drops of the reservoir solution containing 2 mm d-captopril, then the crystal was flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen using precipitant containing 15% glycerol as cryoprotectant and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent data collection at a synchrotron source. Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data sets were collected at the ID14–4 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. A data set of 360 frames at λ = 0.9792 Å was collected at 1.5-Å resolution with 0.5° oscillation steps. Data integration performed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (43Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar) gave an initial ambiguity in the space group determination, since according to the automated indexing procedure, the crystal could be cubic or trigonal, with similar distortion indexes. The data were re-indexed using DENZO/SCALE-PACK and scaled using SCALA (44CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar), trying different space groups to solve this ambiguity. After this stage, the crystal was considered to be cubic I23 or I213, with a = b = c = 112.85 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, Rsym = 0.117 (1 molecule/asymmetric unit), or trigonal R3, with a = b = 159.69 Å, c = 97.82 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, Rsym = 0.119 (3 or 4 molecules/asymmetric unit) (Table I).Table IX-ray data collection and structure refinement of BlaBData collection statisticsUnit cell parametersa = b = 159.7 Å, c = 97.8 Å α = β = 90°, γ = 120°Space groupR3Molecules/asymmetric unit4Max. resolution (Å)1.5No. of unique reflections138,708Overall completeness (%)90Last shell completeness (%)aLast resolution shell 1.58-1.50 Å.90Multiplicity2.6RsymbRsym = Σ|Ij- <1> |/Σ <I>, where Ij is the intensity for reflection j, and <I> is the mean intensity.0.12 (0.18)aLast resolution shell 1.58-1.50 Å.Refinement statisticsNo. of reflectionscno σ cutoff.133860No. of atoms (non H)8047RworkingdRworking = Σ ∥Fo| - |Fc∥/Σ|Fo|, calculated with the working set.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 313-323Google Scholar) with no ions or water molecules was used as a model for molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (46Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar). Because the x-ray data could be indexed in three space groups (I213, I23, and R3), various tests were performed. In brief, data indexed in R3 were used successfully in AMoRe with a BcII model performing a four molecule/asymmetric unit search (c-factor = 36.3%, R-factor = 48.0%). With these solutions and using a noncrystallographic symmetry-averaging map calculated using the CNS program (47Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), a partial model of BlaB was built using TURBO (48Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory 88. Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). A full model of BlaB at 1.5 Å was made using ARP/WARP (49Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 448-455Google Scholar). From the initial (2Fo – Fc) and (Fo – Fc) maps, the inhibitor, d-captopril, was localized close to the Zn2+ ions in the active site. Further cycles of energy minimization, B-factor refinement, and water picking were performed using CNS programs (47Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Models for d-captopril were not included until their conformations were well defined by the unbiased |Fo – Fc|, ϕcalc electron density maps. d-Captopril molecules in each of the four monomers were modeled. The model was refined without any non-crystallographic-symmetry restrains, yielding Rworking = 18.95% and Rfree = 20.76%. The BlaB monomer shares a structural feature with other members of the MBL family, an αβ/βα fold, in which a compact core of two β-sheets is surrounded by α-helices (Fig. 1). The crystal, which shows a cubic pseudo-symmetry, belongs to the space group R3 and has four monomers per asymmetric unit (A, B, C, and D). The four monomers are practically identical, with a few local differences due to slightly different environments or to effects of crystal packing (e.g. monomers A, B, and D are missing the last four C-terminal residues, whereas monomer C is missing the last six). The root mean square deviation between the conserved Cα atoms of the four molecules is about 0.1 Å. The active site of BlaB shares a feature with other subclass B1 structures, namely that two Zn2+ ions (Zn1 and Zn2) occupy the two metal binding sites, the His site (His-116, His-118, His-196) and the Cys site (Asp-120, Cys-221, His-263) (Fig. 2, a and c). A clear electron density corresponding to a molecule of d-captopril was found close to the active site. The inhibitor intercalates its sulfhydryl group between the two Zn2+ ions (distance S-Zn1, 2.32 Å; S-Zn2, 2.30 Å in monomer A) (Fig. 2). The sulfur atom is also close to the NE2 of His-196 (3.34 Å) (Table II). The inhibitor is located in the positively charged groove leading to the active site (Fig. 3a) and is present in the four molecules/asymmetric unit with full occupancy.Table IIInteractions between BlaB and D-captopril (≤3.5 Å)D-CaptoprilMonomerABCDO2CG D1193.503.493.493.39OD1 D1193.453.313.393.29OD2 D1193.313.463.353.29NZ K1672.792.862.782.85Water(348) 2.86(606) 2.88(590) 2.91(502) 2.93Water(671) 2.97(698) 2.96C9CG D1193.443.463.463.45OD1 D1193.393.463.47NZ K1673.49O3CA H1183.103.133.103.08CB H1183.193.233.203.15C H1183.403.403.413.39N D1192.722.712.742.73CG D1193.423.423.473.49OD2 D1193.43NZ K1673.49C5CD2 Y2333.443.473.483.46CE2 Y2333.313.333.333.34O1Water(335) 2.76(450) 2.78(468) 2.77(285) 2.74C1CB H1183.503.493.49OD1 D1203.283.243.253.21Zn13.243.193.253.22Zn23.373.413.423.35SNE2 H1963.343.373.333.35Zn12.322.332.342.36Zn22.302.312.342.27 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Two inhibitors in the active site cleft.a, GRASP representation (52Nicholls A.

The carboxylic group of d-captopril is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between its O2 and the NZ of Lys-167 and two water molecules; the other carboxylic oxygen, O3, is bound to the amide main chain of Asp-119. The O1 carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor also makes a hydrogen bond with another water molecule (Fig. 2b). In addition, the inhibitor is stabilized by several hydrophobic contacts between its carbons and His-118, Asp-120, and Tyr-233 (Fig. 2b and Table II). Structural Comparisons—The sequence of BlaB shows 25-35% identity with those of other subclass B1 β-lactamases. The secondary structure topology of the four available x-ray structures (BcII, CcrA, BlaB, and IMP-1) is very similar, the only difference being that the first short β-strand seen in BcII and CcrA is absent in BlaB and IMP-1. Pairwise superposition of the Cα atoms of BlaB and BcII (1BMC), Ccra (1ZNB), or IMP-1 (1JJE) gives a root mean difference density of 1.5, 1.4, and 1.9 Å, respectively. In subclass B1, there is a loop between β2 and β3 (residues 61–65), which is disordered in the structure of native BcII (12Carfi A. Parès S. Duée E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Google Scholar). However, in the presence of an inhibitor, the loop is stabilized (30Concha N.O. Janson C.A. Rowling P. Pearson S. Cheever C.A. Clarke B.P. Lewis C. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4288-4298Google Scholar), transforming the active site groove into a tunnel-shaped cavity. In the BlaB structure, the loop is also well defined, probably due to the presence of d-captopril in the active site (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, d-captopril has no direct interaction with any residues in the loop (Fig. 2, b and c; Table II). The flexibility in the loop may help to accommodate the inhibitor, which itself may help to stabilize the loop. This stabilization takes place indirectly by Trp-87, which makes a double hydrogen bond between its NE1 and the OD1 of Asp-119 and the water molecule that hydrogen bonds to the O1 carbonyl oxygen of d-captopril (Table II). Trp-87 also makes hydrophobic contacts with the active site residue, His-263. All these interactions determine the position of Trp-87, which establishes hydrophobic interactions between its ring and two residues, Phe-61 and Asn-59. The loop is strongly stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygens and the amide nitrogens of the backbone of this region (amino acids 57–69). In the apical part of the loop facing the solvent, a water molecule forms a bridge between the ND2 of Asn-62 and the carbonyl oxygen of Phe-61, which also makes a hydrogen bond with the amide backbone of Thr-64. In addition, the amide backbone of Phe-61 makes hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of the main chain of Thr-64. A second water molecule makes hydrogen bonds with this bridging water molecule and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-67. In BlaB, the loop appears to be closer to the rest of the protein than in the other three structures, with the hydrophobic residues, Phe-61, Tyr-67, and Trp-87, pointing toward the inside of the protein and creating a hydrophobic environment even though the loop does not interact directly with the inhibitor. In addition, the loops in BlaB and BcII are in different positions, e.g. the distance between equivalent residues in BlaB and BcII is 5.44 Å for Phe-61 and 5.77 Å for Asn-62. Interestingly, in subclass B1 MBLs, bulky hydrophobic residues are often found at positions 61, 67, and 87. In all MBL structures, the Asp or Asn residue at residue 84 has an φ angle outside the allowed range (φ ∼ 60 ± 1°) and plays an important structural role, contributing to the architecture of the active site. Of the residues that are highly conserved and/or potentially involved in substrate binding in subclass B1 β-lactamases, three positions are particularly interesting in the BlaB structure, 224, 233, and 236 (Fig. 2c). Lys-224 is very well defined in the electron density map (NZ, B factor of 13.5 Å2). The NZ makes three hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of the preceding amino acid (Ile-223) and two water molecules. Lys-224 is assumed to interact with the carboxyl group of the β-lactam antibiotic (30Concha N.O. Janson C.A. Rowling P. Pearson S. Cheever C.A. Clarke B.P. Lewis C. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4288-4298Google Scholar). However, Lys-224 is not found in subclass B3 MBLs, and no equivalent residue is observed in a similar spatial position in the L1 (15Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Google Scholar) or FEZ-1 structures (50Garcia-Sáez I. Mercuri P.S. Papamicael C. Kahn R. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Rossolini G.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 651-660Google Scholar). Based on x-ray crystallographic structures, Asn-233 and Zn1 were thought to form an oxyanion hole to polarize the carbonyl group of the β-lactam antibiotic (50Garcia-Sáez I. Mercuri P.S. Papamicael C. Kahn R. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Rossolini G.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 651-660Google Scholar, 51Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 823-836Google Scholar). In BlaB, Asn-233 is replaced by Tyr, and the hydroxyl of the tyrosine is 7.88 Å away from Zn1 (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, Glu-236, which is an aspartic acid residue in the BcII, CcrA, and IMP-1 enzymes, makes three hydrogen-bonds with OH Tyr-233, NEZ His-118 (a zinc ligand), and a water molecule, whereas Asp-236 in the other three x-ray structures only hydrogen-bonds to NEZ His-118 and a water molecule. Consequently, no oxyanion hole is observed in the present structure. However, the observed position of Tyr-233 could be the result of complex formation, since C3, C5, and C6 of d-captopril make hydrophobic contacts with the tyrosine side chain. Nevertheless, rotation around χ1 is sterically forbidden, and only a large conformational change of the 227–237 loop (Fig. 2c) upon substrate binding could bring OH Tyr-233 or other side chain residues into positions where they could form part of the oxyanion hole. Binding of the Inhibitor—The main interaction between BlaB and d-captopril occurs through intercalation of the sulfur atom of the inhibitor between the two Zn2+ ions, leading to the removal of the activated water (OH– group) (Fig. 2, a and b; Table II). A similar situation has been seen in the three-dimensional structure of IMP-1 in complex with a mercaptocarboxylate inhibitor (2-mercaptomethyl-4-phenyl-butyrylimino)-(5-tetrazol-1-ylmethyl-thiophen-2-yl)-acetic acid) (30Concha N.O. Janson C.A. Rowling P. Pearson S. Cheever C.A. Clarke B.P. Lewis C. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4288-4298Google Scholar). Structural superposition of the structures of the two protein-inhibitor complexes shows that the inhibitors intercalate their sulfur groups almost identically between the two Zn2+ ions of the active site. A striking observation is that, although they are located in different parts of the active site, together the two inhibitors cover the entire active site cavity (Fig. 3a). The fusion of these two inhibitor molecules could be a good starting point for generating a new family of more effective inhibitors (Fig. 3b). Based on the structural superposition using this new molecule, many interactions would be retained, including those between the S atom and the two Zn2+ ions, the carboxylate groups and the main-chain amide nitrogens (N119 and N233), the carboxylate groups and the NZ of two lysines (Lys-167 and Lys-224), and many hydrophobic contacts. In the crystal structure of IMP-1 complexed with a succinic acid derivative (33Toney J.H. Hammond G.G. Fitzgerald P.M. Sharma N. Balkovec J.M. Rouen G.P. Olson S.H. Hammond M.L. Greenlee M.L. Gao Y.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31913-31918Google Scholar), one oxygen of the carboxylic group of the inhibitor is located between the two Zn2+ ions, displacing the hydroxyl. Curiously, in the three-dimensional structure of the subclass B3 MBL FEZ-1 complexed with d-captopril (50Garcia-Sáez I. Mercuri P.S. Papamicael C. Kahn R. Frère J.-M. Galleni M. Rossolini G.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 651-660Google Scholar), the inhibitor is not located in the active site, because a sulfate ion from the crystallization solution intercalates one of its oxygen atoms between the two Zn2+ ions. In the complex of B. fragilis CcrA with a biphenyl tetrazole (23Toney J.H. Fitzgerald P.M. Grover-Sharma N. Olson S.H. May W.J. Sundelof J.G. Vanderwall D.E. Cleary K.A. Grant S.K. Wu J.K. Kozarich J.W. Pompliano D.L. Hammond G.G. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 185-196Google Scholar), the tetrazole ring of the inhibitor acts as an extra ligand for the second Zn2+, changing its coordination and provoking a distortion of the active site and the removal of the water molecules from the active site. Taking together our results and all currently known three-dimensional structures of MBLs complexed with inhibitors (23Toney J.H. Fitzgerald P.M. Grover-Sharma N. Olson S.H. May W.J. Sundelof J.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31913-31918Google Scholar), we can conclude that there is a high variability in the modes of binding of the inhibitors depending on the β-lactamase sequence and the size and chemical properties of the inhibitor. However, one feature is constant, which is the intercalation of a charged group between the Zn2+ ions and the removal of the bridging hydroxide directly involved in water-mediated hydrolysis of the substrate. Moreover, the new BlaB structure presented here highlights the structural diversity in the MBL family. The evolution of broad substrate profile enzymes, such as BlaB, poses a serious threat to antibacterial therapy, and a detailed analysis of inhibitor-enzyme complexes is vital for the design of new inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W1998375609,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two glutaredoxins, encoded by GRX1 and GRX2, that are required for resistance to reactive oxygen species. We recently reported that Grx1 is active as a glutathione peroxidase and can directly reduce hydroperoxides (Collinson, E. J., Wheeler, G. L., Garrido, E. O., Avery, A. M., Avery, S. V., and Grant, C. M. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 16712–16717). We now show that Grx2 is also a general hydroperoxidase, and kinetic data indicate that both enzymes have a similar pattern of activity, which is highest with hydrogen peroxide, followed by cumene hydroperoxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Furthermore, both Grx1 and Grx2 are shown be active as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and their activity with model substrates such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is similar to their activity with hydroperoxides. Analysis of the Grx1 active site residues shows that Cys-27, but not Cys-30, is required for both the peroxidase and transferase activities, indicating that these reactions proceed via a monothiol mechanism. Deletion analysis shows that Grx1 and Grx2 have an overlapping function with yeast GSTs, encoded by GTT1 and GTT2, and are responsible for the majority of cellular GST activity. In addition, multiple mutants lacking GRX1, GRX2, GTT1, and GTT2 show increased sensitivity to stress conditions, including exposure to xenobiotics, heat, and oxidants. In summary, glutaredoxins are multifunctional enzymes with oxidoreductase, peroxidase, and GST activity, and are therefore ideally suited to detoxify the wide range of xenobiotics and oxidants that can be generated during diverse stress conditions.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and overexpression of GRX1 or GRX2 increases resistance to various hydroperoxides (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of GRX1 and GRX2 is up-regulated in response to stress conditions, including exposure to oxidants, with both genes regulated via stress-responsive elements (9Grant C.M. Luikenhuis S. Beckhouse A. Soderbergh M. Dawes I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Differences in gene expression between GRX1 and GRX2 indicate that the two glutaredoxins may play distinct roles during different growth and stress conditions (9Grant C.M. Luikenhuis S. Beckhouse A. Soderbergh M. Dawes I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a further difference between Grx1 and Grx2 is shown by recent findings indicating that two isoforms of Grx2 can be detected in cells that localize to the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively (10Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified Grx1 was shown to have glutathione peroxidase activity and could reduce hydroperoxides directly, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This reaction proceeds in a catalytic manner using reducing power provided by NADPH, GSH, and glutathione reductase. The glutathione peroxidase activity of yeast Grx1 seems to be conserved; a recent report has shown that a rice glutaredoxin has the same activity (11Lee KO L.J. Yoo JY Jang HH Moon JC Jung BG Chi YH Park SK Lee SS Lim CO Yun DJ Cho MJ Lee SY. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, yeast does not contain any classic glutathione peroxidases but expresses three phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases (PHGPx) encoded by GPX1–3 (12Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These PHGPx enzymes have activity with phospholipid hydroperoxides as well as nonphopsholipid peroxides and are able to protect membrane lipids against peroxidation. Thus, Grx1 and Grx2 provide an overlapping defense system with Gpx1–3 protection against a range of hydroperoxides. The glutaredoxin-mediated resistance to hydroperoxides seems to be part of the glutathione conjugation/removal system of cells, because it is absent in strains lacking glutathione S-transferases (GTT1, GTT2) or the GS-X pump (YCF1) (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a major family of proteins involved in the detoxification of many xenobiotics compounds (13Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). They catalyze the conjugation of electrophilic substrates to glutathione before their removal from cells via glutathione conjugate pumps. Yeast Gtt1 and Gtt2 share only limited homology with GSTs from other organisms but are active in a GST assay using the model substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Strains lacking GTT1 and GTT2 are viable and are unaffected in growth during normal aerobic conditions. In addition, the gtt1 gtt2 mutant does not show any increased sensitivity to CDNB, which is surprising given that Gtt1 and Gtt2 would be expected to detoxify CDNB via conjugation (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the Ycf1 GS-X pump is required for CDNB resistance (15Li Z.-S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These findings led to the suggestion that both GST-dependent and -independent pathways for CDNB detoxification exist in yeast (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To account for the involvement of Gtt1, Gtt2, and Ycf1 in glutaredoxin-mediated antioxidant activity, we proposed a model in which the glutathione peroxidase activity of yeast glutaredoxins converts hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols, which can then be conjugated to GSH by glutathione S-transferases and transported into the vacuole by Ycf1 (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have extended these findings to show that Grx2, like Grx1, is a general hydroperoxidase. Furthermore, both Grx1 and Grx2 are shown to have glutathione S-transferase activity, and we provide the first evidence that glutaredoxins and glutathione S-transferases have overlapping functions in protection against stress conditions including heat shock, oxidative stress, and exposure to CDNB. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table I. Strains were grown in rich YEPD medium (2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, and 1% (w/v) yeast extract) or minimal SD media (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, and 2% (w/v) glucose) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases: 2 mm leucine, 0.3 mm histidine, 0.4 mm tryptophan, 1 mm lysine, 0.15 mm adenine, and 0.2 mm uracil.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids—Multicopy plasmids containing GRX1 (mcGRX1) and GRX2 (mcGRX2) have been described previously (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBAD-YGRX1 contains a His6-tagged version of GRX1 and was a kind gift from Barry Rosen (16Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34738-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The GRX2 gene was amplified from mcGRX2 by PCR to introduce an NcoI site at the 5′-end and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end. The forward primer was 5′-CCAACCATGGTATCCCAGGAAACAGTTGCT-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-ATTTGAATTCTTGAAATACCGGCTTCAATA-3′. The resulting 330-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), before digestion with NcoI and EcoRI and insertion into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of pBAD/Myc-HisC (Invitrogen) in frame with the His6 tag, creating plasmid pBAD-YGRX2. Site-directed Mutagenesis of GRX1—The two active site cysteine residues of Grx1 (Cys-27 and Cys-30) were mutated to serine residues in plasmid mcGRX1 creating plasmids mcgrx1-C27S and mcgrx1-C30S. PCR was performed using forward mutagenic oligonucleotides that hybridized 53 bp downstream of the ATG start codon (5′-AACGAGATCTTCGTCGCATCCAAAACGTACTCCCCATACTGCCATGCAGC-3′and 5′-AACGAGATCTTCGTCGCATCCAAAACGTACTGCCCATACTCCCATGCAGCC-3′) and a reverse oligonucleotide that hybridized 344 bp downstream of the TAG stop codon (5′-ATAGCGCTAGCAGCACGCCATAGTG-3′). The resulting mutagenized 612-bp fragments were cloned into mcGRX1 using a naturally occurring BglII restriction site and a NheI restriction site introduced by the 3′ oligonucleotide (underlined). Sensitivity to Xenobiotics—Sensitivity to xenobiotics was determined by spotting strains onto YEPD plates containing various concentrations of H2O2, CHP, and CDNB. Cells were grown to stationary phase, and 5-μl aliquots of diluted cultures were spotted onto appropriate plates. Sensitivity was determined by comparison of growth with the wild-type strain after 3 days. Dose-response curves to H2O2 and CDNB were made by growing cells to exponential phase (A600 = 1) in SD medium at 30 °C, and treating with oxidants for 1 h. Aliquots of cells were diluted in fresh YEPD medium and plated in triplicate on YEPD plates to obtain viable counts after 3 days' growth. Heat Shock Treatment—Cells were grown to stationary phase in YEPD medium at 30 °C, before heat shock at 52 °C for 10 min. Survival was determined by plating onto YEPD plates in triplicate to obtain viable counts after 3 days' growth. Protein Purification and Western Blot Analysis—His-tagged Grx1 and Grx2 were purified using Ni2+ agarose columns as described previously (16Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34738-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 18% SDS-PAGE mini-gels, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Glutaredoxin activity was measured by the reduction of the mixed disulfide formed between HED and GSH (17Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The components of the glutaredoxin system, NADPH (0.4 mm), GSH (1 mm), and glutathione reductase (6 μg/ml), as well as HED (0.7 mm), were added to a reaction volume of 200 μl in 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 7.4. A mixed disulfide between HED and GSH is formed within 2 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of 5 pmol of Grx1 or Grx2. The reaction was followed by the decrease in A340 because of the oxidation of NADPH. Peroxidase activity was measured with purified glutaredoxins as described previously (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase activity was measured with purified glutaredoxins and cell-free extracts using CDNB, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB), and ethacrynic acid as substrates. Reaction mixtures contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 1 mm GSH, and varying concentrations of substrate in a reaction volume of 200 μl. Reactions were started by the addition of 5 pmol of purified glutaredoxin or 75 μg of cell-free extracts and were followed by the increase in A340 (CDNB and DCNB) or A270 (ethacrynic acid) caused by the formation of GSH S-conjugates (18Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione Oxidoreductase and Peroxidase Activities of Grx1 and Grx2—After our observation that Grx1 has glutathione peroxidase activity, we purified Grx2 to compare its catalytic ability. Glutaredoxins are routinely assayed for their ability to reduce the mixed disulfide formed between HED and GSH (17Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The oxidoreductase activity of Grx2 (99.6 ± 7.9 μmol/min/mg) was somewhat lower than that of Grx1 (211.8 ± 6.9 μmol/min/mg), indicating that Grx1 is more efficient as a thiotransferase. We next examined whether Grx2 could act as a glutathione peroxidase, similar to Grx1 (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Grx2 was able to reduce CHP in a catalytic manner in a reaction that depended on the presence of GSH, Glr1, and NADPH (data not shown). The ability of Grx2 to act as a general hydroperoxidase was investigated using various concentrations of hydroperoxides (tert-butyl hydroperoxide, CHP, and H2O2). Grx2 could reduce all three hydroperoxides, and peroxidase activity was hyperbolic with respect to the concentration of peroxide used (data not shown). Comparing the kinetic constants of Grx1 and Grx2 (Table II) showed that Grx1 is catalytically more efficient than Grx2 as a general hydroperoxidase. The Km values for Grx2 (0.87–2.2 mm) were generally higher than for Grx1 (0.52–0.88 mm), indicating that Grx1 has a higher affinity for hydroperoxides than Grx2. However, both enzymes showed similar patterns of enzyme specificity (Kcat/Km); the greatest activity was directed toward H2O2, followed by CHP and tert-butyl hydroperoxide.Table IICatalytic properties of Grx1 and Grx2SubstrateGrx1Grx2KmaKm values for each substrate were calculated using Eadie Ofstee plots and represent averages of at least three independent determinations.KcatKcat/KmKmaKm values for each substrate were calculated using Eadie Ofstee plots and represent averages of at least three independent determinations.KcatKcat/Kmmms-1M-1s-1mms-1M-1s-1H2O20.8847.15.3 × 1042.052.92.6 × 104t-BHbtert-butyl hydroperoxide.0.372.97.8 × 1032.214.36.5 × 103CHP0.5214.32.8 × 1040.8712.91.5 × 104CDNB4.213.13.1 × 1030.170.995.9 × 103DCNB1.30.221.7 × 1020.271.14.2 × 103a Km values for each substrate were calculated using Eadie Ofstee plots and represent averages of at least three independent determinations.b tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Open table in a new tab Overexpression of GRX1 and GRX2 Increases Sensitivity to CDNB—Glutathione S-transferases from mammalian systems can act as general hydroperoxidases catalyzing the breakdown of alkyl hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols (19Zhao T. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Yeast Gtt1 and Gtt2 share little homology with mammalian glutathione S-transferases, and a gtt1 gtt2 mutant is unaffected in sensitivity to the model GST substrate CDNB (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Grx1 and Grx2 might function in the detoxification of CDNB. Overexpression of GRX1 and GRX2 was achieved using multicopy plasmids and was confirmed by means of Western blot analysis (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Wild-type and ycf1 mutant transformants were grown to stationary phase and spotted onto plates containing various concentrations of CDNB. No strains were able to grow on plates containing CDNB concentrations higher than 0.1 mm (data not shown). Surprisingly, elevating the level of Grx1 or Grx2 was found to increase the sensitivity of both strains to 0.075 mm CDNB compared with the vector-alone controls (Fig. 1). This is similar to findings that glutaredoxins increase the sensitivity of a ycf1 mutant to CHP (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and rat liver GSTT1 causes increased bioactivation of dihaloalkanes (20Sherratt P.J. Manson M.M. Thomson A.M. Hissink E.A. Neal G.E. van Bladeren P.J. Green T. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results indicate that glutaredoxins have some activity toward CDNB and may convert it to a more toxic product. We therefore examined whether the yeast glutaredoxins could act as glutathione S-transferases. Glutathione S-transferase Activity of Grx1 and Grx2—The ability of glutaredoxins to catalyze the formation of GSH conjugates was tested in vitro using purified Grx1 and Grx2. Reaction mixtures contained GSH and CDNB and were followed by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm caused by the formation of the conjugate. Both Grx1 and Grx2 were able to catalyze conjugate formation, and reactions were dependent on the presence of both GSH and glutaredoxins because there was little or no activity when each was omitted from the assay (Fig. 2A). The conjugation of GSH to CDNB was analyzed using differing amounts of Grx1 and Grx2 and was found to show strict linearity, confirming that glutaredoxins have efficient catalytic activities as glutathione S-transferases (Fig. 2B). We next determined the kinetics of glutathione S-transferase activity with GST substrates, including CDNB, DCNB, and ethacrynic acid. Grx1 and Grx2 showed no measurable activity with ethacrynic acid, whereas both enzymes were active against CDNB and DCNB (Table II). Comparing the kinetic constants (Table II) showed that Grx2 is catalytically more efficient than Grx1 as a glutathione S-transferase. Km values for Grx1 (1.3–4.2 mm) were generally higher than for Grx2 (0.99–1.1 mm), and enzyme specificity values (Kcat/Km) for Grx2 (4.2–5.9 × 103 M–1 s–1) were higher than for Grx1 (1.7 × 102 to 3.1 × 103 M–1 s–1). Cellular Glutathione S-transferase Activity—Given that purified recombinant Gtt1 and Gtt2 (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Grx1 and Grx2 (Fig. 2) have glutathione S-transferase activity, we determined their relative contributions to cellular GST activity. The quadruple gtt1 gtt2 grx1 grx2 mutant was viable and was unaffected in growth during normal aerobic conditions compared with the wild-type strain (data not shown). GST activity was therefore assayed in cell-free lysates from the wild-type, gtt1 gtt2, grx1 grx2, and gtt1 gtt2 grx1 grx2 mutants using CDNB and DCNB as substrates (Fig. 3). The wild-type strain showed similar GST activity with both CDNB and DCNB. Loss of GTT1 and GTT2 had little effect on GST activity assayed with CDNB, and caused a slight increase in activity toward DCNB. In contrast, loss of GRX1 and GRX2 reduced the cellular GST activity with CDNB and DCNB by ∼50%. GST activity measured from the quadruple mutant was ∼8-fold lower than the wild-type strain with both CDNB and DCNB. These data indicate that Grx1, Grx2, Gtt1, and Gtt2 account for the majority of glutathione S-transferase activity detected within yeast cells, and glutaredoxins seem to be more active than glutathione S-transferases under the conditions tested. Overlapping Functions of Yeast Glutaredoxins and Glutathione S-transferases—Strains deleted for GTT1 and GTT2 are unaffected in growth during normal aerobic conditions but exhibit increased sensitivity to heat shock in stationary phase (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the heat shock sensitivity of the quadruple gtt1 gtt2 grx1 grx2 mutant. Cells were grown to stationary phase at 30 °C and subjected to heat shock at 52 °C for 10 min. This treatment resulted in 35% loss of viability in the wild-type strain (Fig. 4A). Stains deleted for GRX1 and GRX2 were no more sensitive to heat shock than the wild-type strain. In agreement with previous findings (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the gtt1 gtt2 mutant was sensitive compared with the wild-type strain, with ∼54% survival after the heat treatment. Interestingly, the quadruple gtt1 gtt2 grx1 grx2 mutant was even more sensitive, and survival was reduced to ∼36%. Mutants lacking GRX1 and GRX2 are sensitive to oxidative stress conditions (6Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar), whereas mutants lacking GTT1 and GTT2 are unaffected in sensitivity to a range of oxidants and xenobiotics (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the gtt1 gtt2, grx1 grx2, and gtt1 gtt2 grx1 grx2 mutants for sensitivity to stress conditions. Cells were grown to stationary phase and spotted onto plates containing various concentrations of H2O2, CHP, and CDNB (Fig. 4B). For all three treatments, the quadruple gtt1 gtt2 grx1 grx2 mutant was more sensitive than either the wild-type or gtt1 gtt2 and grx1 grx2 mutant strains. These data indicate that glutaredoxins (Grx1–2) and glutathione S-transferases (Gtt1–2) have an overlapping function in protection against stress conditions induced by heat, oxidants, and CDNB. Cys-27, but Not Cys-30, Is Required for Peroxidase and Transferase Activity of Grx1—The structure of glutaredoxins has been highly conserved throughout evolution, particularly in the region of the active site (3Wells W.W. Yang Y. Deits T.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1993; 66: 149-199PubMed Google Scholar, 17Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) including two redox-active cysteine residues (positions 27 and 30 in yeast numbering (6Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar)). The two active site Cys residues in Grx1 were replaced with Ser residues to determine their role in peroxidase and transferase activities. These mutations were constructed in plasmid mcGRX1 to create mcgrx1-C27S and mcgrx1-C30S, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Peroxidase activity was tested by examining resistance to H2O2 and transferase activity by resistance to CDNB. Overexpression of GRX1 and grx1-C30S increased the resistance of a wild-type strain to H2O2, whereas grx1-C30S had no effect relative to the vector control (Fig. 5A). Similarly, overexpression of GRX1 and grx1-C30S increased the sensitivity of a wild-type strain to CDNB, whereas, grx1-C30S had no effect relative to the vector control. These data indicate that a single active site Cys residue (Cys27) is required for both peroxidase and transferase activities. Yeast, like all organisms, must be able to adapt to changes in their external environment, such as exposure to xenobiotics and oxidants. In most cases, these responses depend on gene activation, such as the response to H2O2, where a substantial number of proteins is induced (21Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genome-wide analysis has shown that there are differences as well as similarities among the many sets of genes activated in response to different stress conditions (22Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar). For example, the cellular responses to a diverse range of stress conditions, including oxidative, osmotic, heat, and starvation, are mediated by a number of genes containing stress-responsive elements (23Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 24Kobayashi N. McEntee K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). GRX1 and GRX2 form part of these responses, with both genes activated by multiple stress conditions via the Hog1 MAPK and the Ras-protein kinase A pathways (9Grant C.M. Luikenhuis S. Beckhouse A. Soderbergh M. Dawes I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our studies show that glutaredoxins are multifunctional enzymes with oxidoreductase, peroxidase, and GST activity and are therefore ideally suited to detoxify the wide range of xenobiotics and oxidants that might be generated during diverse stress conditions. The antioxidant activity of Grx1 and Grx2 provides protection against hydroperoxides (6Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The localization of Grx2 in the mitochondria may account for the apparent redundancy of yeast glutaredoxins, indicating that Grx1 and Grx2 play complementary roles in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively (10Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins have long been thought to protect against oxidative stress by catalyzing the reduction of protein mixed disulfides formed with GSH (25Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Mixed disulfides can protect protein-SH groups against irreversible oxidation, and in vitro studies have shown that they can be reduced by glutaredoxins (26Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 27Jung C.-H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, in vivo data indicate that the levels of protein-GSH mixed disulfides are unaffected in yeast mutants lacking GRX1 and GRX2 during both normal growth conditions and exposure to H2O2 (6Luikenhuis S. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 9: 1081-1091Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Garrido E.O. Grant C.M. Molec. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this present study, we show that both Grx1 and Grx2 have oxidoreductase activity against the mixed disulfide formed between HED and GSH, although it remains unclear whether this activity serves a protective function against physiological substrates formed during stress conditions. We originally showed that Grx1 is a glutathione peroxidase that can reduce various hydroperoxides with activity comparable with that of yeast PHGPx2 and various eukaryotic glutathione peroxidases (8Collinson E.J. Wheeler G. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the present study, we show that Grx2 can directly reduce hydroperoxides, albeit with a lower catalytic efficiency than Grx1. Because glutathione peroxidase activity can be associated with glutathione S-transferases in mammalian cells (19Zhao T. Singhal S.S. Piper J.T. Cheng J. Pandya U. Clark-Wronski J. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether Grx1 and Grx2 have GST activity. Both Grx1 and Grx2 were active in a GST assay using CDNB and DCNB as substrates, with Grx2 showing a higher catalytic efficiency than Grx1. Furthermore, the activity of Grx1 and Grx2 with GST substrates was similar to their activity with hydroperoxides. Mutant analysis revealed that Grx1 and -2 have an overlapping function as GSTs with Gtt1 and Gtt2, with loss of all four genes substantially reducing cellular GST activity and leading to sensitivity to stress conditions, including exposure to xenobiotics, heat, and oxidants. Two reaction mechanisms have been described for glutaredoxins, which differ in their requirement for active site cysteine residues. Protein disulfide reductase activity with substrates such as ribonucleotide reductase requires both active site cysteine residues and proceeds via reaction of the dithiol form of glutaredoxin with the oxidized disulfide substrate (30Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 31Yang Y.F. Wells W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12759-12765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the glutathione-disulfide oxidoreductase activity observed with low molecular weight disulfides, such as HED, proceeds via a monothiol mechanism that is initiated by the nucleophilic N-terminal cysteine residue (30Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These reaction mechanisms seem to be conserved for the yeast glutaredoxins because alkylation studies have shown that the N-terminal cysteine residue is the nucleophile in disulfide reduction chemistry catalyzed by yeast glutaredoxin (32Gan Z.-R. Sardana M.K. Jacobs J.W. Polokoff M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that Cys-27, but not Cys-30, is required for both the peroxidase and transferase activities, indicating that these reactions proceed via a monothiol mechanism. Based on structural and functional data, three glutaredoxin subfamilies have been proposed (33Xia B. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Yeast Grx1 and Grx2 are part of the first class, which includes classic dithiol glutaredoxins, such as E. coli Grx1 and Grx2 and human Grx1. Members of the second subfamily of glutaredoxins, which differ from classical glutaredoxins in that they contain a single cysteine residue at their active sites, were originally identified in yeast (GRX3–5) but are conserved throughout evolution from bacterial to mammalian species (7Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These enzymes are able to reduce protein-mixed disulfides in a reaction that proceeds via a monothiol mechanism and have been implicated in protection against oxidative stress (7Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The third class of glutaredoxins contains an N-terminal Grx domain but shows low overall sequence identity with classic glutaredoxins. Interestingly, despite a lack of sequence homology, structural analysis of E. coli Grx2 has revealed that these glutaredoxins are homologous to the GST superfamily of proteins (33Xia B. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This structural homology is particularly shown toward enzymes belonging to the θ- and ω-classes of GSTs. Sequence analysis of yeast Grx1 and Grx2 reveals significant homology with the ω-class of GSTs (Fig. 6). Comparison with human GSTO 1–1 and Schistosoma mansoni GSTO identifies a number of conserved residues that are mainly clustered in the N-terminal portion of Grx1 and Grx2. Identical residues include the Cys-Pro active site residues of the yeast glutaredoxins. The corresponding Cys residue in ω-class GSTs (Cys-32 in GSTO 1–1 and Cys-25 in SmGSTO1) has been shown to form part of the glutathione binding site (the G-site), which makes a mixed disulfide with GSH (29Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5512-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferases contain a substrate binding site (H-site), adjacent to the G-site, that allows conjugation of the thiol group of GSH to an electrophile. This site is constructed from elements of both the N- and C-terminal portions of GSTs, and differences in substrate specificity are thought to be caused by differences in the confirmation of the H-site. The H-site in GSTO 1–1 (29Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A.

The ω-class of GSTs are multifunctional enzymes that have activity with a broad range of substrates (13Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 34Giradini J. Amirante A. Zemzoumi K. Serra E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5512-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, human GSTO1–1 exhibits GST activity, glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase activity, and dehydroascorbate activity characteristic of glutaredoxins (29Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The range of glutathione-dependent antioxidants that has been described in yeast differs from that in other eukaryotic organisms. Unusually, yeast expresses three PHGPxs in the absence of conventional glutathione peroxidases (12Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, only two GST isoenzymes have been found in yeast, which share little homology with GSTs from other organisms (14Choi J.H. Lou W. Vancura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29915-29922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that the multiple antioxidant activities of Grx1 and Grx2 have evolved to complement the peroxidase activities of PHGPx1–3 and the transferase activities of Gtt1–2 in protection against stress conditions. In this view, glutaredoxins are able to protect against a wide range of toxic compounds (xenobiotic or endobiotic) to which yeast cells might be exposed. It remains to be determined whether glutaredoxins from other eukaryotes have a similar range of biochemical activities, but the peroxidase activity seems to be a conserved activity for at least one plant glutaredoxin (11Lee KO L.J.

We explored the functional properties of SNAT1 (the product of the rat Slc38a1 gene) by measuring radiotracer uptake and currents associated with SNAT1 expression in Xenopus oocytes and determined the neuronal-phenotypic and cellular distribution of SNAT1 by confocal laser-scanning microscopy alongside other markers. We found that SNAT1 mediates transport of small, neutral, aliphatic amino acids including glutamine (K0.5 ≈ 0.3 mm), alanine, and the System A-specific analogue 2-(methylamino)isobutyrate. Amino acid transport is driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient. The voltage-dependent binding of Na+ precedes that of the amino acid in a simultaneous transport mechanism. Li+ (but not H+) can substitute for Na+ but results in reduced Vmax. In the absence of amino acid, SNAT1 mediates Na+-dependent presteady-state currents (Qmax ≈ 9 nC) and a nonsaturable cation leak with selectivity Na+, Li+ » H+, K+. Simultaneous flux and current measurements indicate coupling stoichiometry of 1 Na+ per 1 amino acid. SNAT1 protein was detected in somata and proximal dendrites but not nerve terminals of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons throughout the adult CNS. We did not detect SNAT1 expression in astrocytes but detected its expression on the luminal membranes of the ependyma. The functional properties and cellular distribution of SNAT1 support a primary role for SNAT1 in glutamine transport serving the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle in central neurons. Localization of SNAT1 to certain dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and cholinergic motoneurons suggests that SNAT1 may play additional specialized roles, providing metabolic fuel (via α-ketoglutarate) or precursors (cysteine, glycine) for glutathione synthesis.

Glutamine uptake into neurons is mediated largely by a System A-like transporter (5Su T.Z. Campbell G.W. Oxender D.L. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 69-78Google Scholar) and is a crucial step in the “glutamate-glutamine cycle” (6Westergaard N. Sonnewald U. Schousboe A. Dev.

The neuronal enzyme phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG) catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate (9Bradford H.F. Ward H.K.

Int. 1993; 22: 19-29Google Scholar). Specific vesicular transporters package glutamate or GABA for synaptic release.

The predominance of astrocytic rather than neuronal glutamate uptake systems (12Kanai Y. Trotti D. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Reith M.E.A.

However, GABA inactivation transporters are also present on presynaptic membranes (13Cherubini E. Conti F. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 155-162Google Scholar). In astrocytes, the predominant fate of glutamate is conversion to glutamine by the astrocyte-specific glutamine synthetase. Completing the cycle, glutamine export from astrocytes is likely to be mediated by the System N or ASCT2 transporters (8Bode B.P. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2475S-2485SGoogle Scholar, 14Boulland J.-L.

Furthermore, these fluxes represent the major fraction of glucose utilization and are central to the normal energetics of the brain (16Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Hyder F. Shulman R.G. Annu. Rev.

Glutamine may also constitute a significant fuel for many neuronal populations, with glutamate being oxidized to α-ketoglutarate, which enters a truncated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (18Yudkoff M.

SNAT1 mediates the Na+-dependent transport of glutamine and is highly enriched in neurons (21Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Google Scholar). In the present study we explored the functional properties of SNAT1 by applying voltage-clamp and radiotracer techniques in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. Using confocal laser-scanning double-immunofluorescence microscopy, we examined the cellular localization of SNAT1 and the phenotypes of the neuronal populations in which SNAT1 is expressed. We find that the functional properties and cellular distribution of SNAT1 support a key role within the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle, and consider additional roles for SNAT1 in amino acid metabolism in the brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis (under 2-aminoethylbenzoate anesthesia), treated with collagenase A (Roche Diagnostics) and stored at 18 °C in modified Barths' medium (25Mackenzie B. Van Winkle L.J. Biomembrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 327-342Google Scholar). SNAT1 (Slc38a1) cDNA was subcloned into the pTLNii vector under SP6, and SNAT1 cRNA was synthesized in vitro with the use of the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit. SNAT2 cRNA was prepared as described (26Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Google Scholar). (The product of the Slc38a2 gene, SNAT2 was previously named SA1, ATA2, or SAT2.) Oocytes were injected with ≈50 ng of cRNA and incubated 2–3 days before radiotracer or voltage-clamp experiments were performed at 22 to 23 °C (except as noted in Fig. 3H). Standard Na+ uptake medium comprised 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 with Tris base). For low pH media, we lowered the HEPES concentration to 5 mm and added 5 mm MES. For Na+-free or low Na+ medium, NaCl was replaced by equimolar choline chloride (ChoCl). For low Cl– medium, Cl– was replaced by equimolar gluconate. Solutions containing niflumic acid (where specified) also contained 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide.A two-microelectrode voltage clamp was used to measure currents in control oocytes and oocytes expressing SNAT1 or SNAT2. Microelectrodes (resistance 0.5–5 MΩ) were filled with 3 m KCl. Voltage-clamp experiments comprised three protocols: (i) Continuous current recordings were made at a holding potential (Vh) of –70 mV, –50 mV, or +10 mV, low-pass filtered at 20 Hz, and digitized at 20 Hz. (ii) Oocytes were clamped at Vh = –50 mV, and step changes in membrane potential (Vm) were applied (from +50 mV to –150 mV in 20-mV increments), each for a duration of 100 ms, before and after the addition of substrate. Current was low-pass filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at 5 kHz. Steady-state data were obtained by averaging the points over the final 16.7 ms at each Vm step. (iii) A 1-s voltage ramp was applied from –100 mV to +60 mV, preceded by a 20-ms settling phase at –100 mV. Current was filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at 5 kHz. Test solutions were washed out with substrate-free medium (100 mm ChoCl, pH 7.5) for at least 2 min. Steady-state data from protocols (i) or (ii) were fitted to a modified Hill relationship (Equation 1) for which I is the evoked current, Imax the derived current maximum, S the concentration of substrate S (Na+, Li+ or amino acid), K0.5S the substrate concentration at which current was half-maximal, and nH the Hill coefficient for S. I=Imax·SnH(K0.5S)nH+SnH(Eq. 1) Currents obtained over the range of temperatures 21–33 °C (Fig. 3H) were fitted to an integrated Arrhenius function (Equation 2), for which Ea is the Arrhenius activation energy, A the y-intercept, R the universal gas constant (1.987 cal·mol–1·K), T the absolute temperature, and I the current evoked by 100 mm Na+ or the 10 mml-alanine-evoked current in Na+. ln (−I)=lnA−EaR·T(Eq. 2) Radiotracers were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Science Products: l-[3-3H]alanine and l-[3,4(N)-3H]glutamine were used at final specific activity of 0.15–2 GBq·mmol–1 and 2-methylamino-[14C]isobutyrate (MeAIB), at 4 MBq·mmol–1. At the end of the uptake period, oocytes were rinsed with ice-cold ChoCl medium and solubilized with 5% SDS before 3H or 14C contents were assayed by liquid scintillation counting. Na+/amino acid coupling stoichiometry was determined by direct comparison of net inward charge with radiotracer amino acid (l-[3H]alanine or l-[3H]glutamine) accumulation in individual oocytes under voltage clamp (25Mackenzie B.

The amino acid-evoked current was integrated with time to obtain the amino acid-dependent charge (QAla or QGln) and converted to a molar equivalent (assuming monovalency) using the Faraday.Following step-changes in Vm using protocol ii, we obtained pre-steady-state currents in oocytes expressing SNAT1. These were isolated from capacitive transients (which decayed with half times of 0.5–0.9 ms) by subtracting the currents obtained for the same oocyte in the presence of 10 mml-alanine and subtracting the final steady-state level. The compensated currents thus obtained were integrated with time to obtain charge movement (Q) and fitted to the Boltzmann relationship (Equation 3) for which maximal charge Qmax = Qdep – Qhyp (where Qdep and Qhyp represent the charge at depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits), V0.5 is the Vm at the midpoint of charge transfer, z is the apparent valence of the movable charge, and F, R, and T have their usual thermodynamic meanings. Q−QhypQmax=11+exp(z[Vm−V0.5]F/R·T) (Eq. 3) Confocal laser-scanning double-immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described (28Stumm R. Culmsee C. Schäfer M.K.H. Krieglstein J. Weihe E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 798-811Google Scholar, 29Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K.H. Zhu H. Weihe E. Erickson J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 142-155Google Scholar). In brief, deparaffinized frontal serial sections of adult rat brain fixed in Bouin-Hollande solution were incubated overnight at room temperature with the polyclonal rabbit antibody to SNAT1 (1:400 dilution) together with one of the following antibodies as markers: polyclonal guinea pig antibody to VGLUT1 (1:800 dilution), polyclonal guinea pig antibody to VGLUT2 (1:800 dilution), monoclonal mouse antibody KLON SY 38 (2 μg·ml–1; Roche Applied Science) to the synaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin, or a monoclonal mouse antibody MAB3418 (25 μg·ml–1; Chemicon International) to microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), an established marker of neuronal dendrites. Antibodies to VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were raised against the same fusion proteins as our rabbit antisera to VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 (29Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K.H. Zhu H. Weihe E. Erickson J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 142-155Google Scholar). Immunoreactivities were visualized with indocarbocyanine(Cy3)-conjugated species-specific secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 and applied for 45 min at 37 °C, resulting in a red-orange fluorescence labeling, or with biotinylated IgG (Dianova) diluted 1:200 and applied for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with Alexis 488-conjugated streptavidin (MoBiTec) for 2 h at 37 °C, resulting in a green fluorescence. Sections were analyzed with the Olympus Fluoview confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus Optical) and documented as false color confocal images.Somatodendritic labeling by SNAT1 antibody in all areas of the brain was blocked in the presence of 10 μm GST-SNAT1 fusion protein but not by GST protein alone (data not shown). Our SNAT1 antibody was previously characterized in heterologous expression systems and cerebellar granule neuronal cultures and by Western analysis of brain homogenates and cultured cells (21Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Google Scholar). Our VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 antibodies were previously characterized by double-fluorescence deconvolution microscopy and Western blot analysis (30Schäfer M.K.H. Varoqui H. Defamie N. Weihe E. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50734-50748Google Scholar). Fluorescence labeling was blocked by preadsorption of the antisera with 10 μm GST fusion proteins, and immunoreactive bands were absent following preadsorotion with 1 μm GST fusion proteins (data not shown).RESULTSSNAT1 Is a Na+-dependent, Neutral Amino Acid Transporter—We explored the characteristics of SNAT1 by measuring radiotracer uptake and currents associated with the expression of SNAT1 in Xenopus oocytes. We found that SNAT1-mediated amino acid transport was saturable, Na+-dependent, and rheogenic. SNAT1 stimulated the uptake of 100 μm [14C]MeAIB, a characteristic inhibitor of System A, in Na+ but not in choline. The Na+-dependent component of MeAIB transport mediated by SNAT1 was 44-fold that in control oocytes (Fig. 1A). A range of amino acids evoked large inward currents of up to –2,000 nA in voltage-clamped oocytes expressing SNAT1, whereas amino acid-evoked currents in control oocytes were < –3 nA (see also Ref. 31Mackenzie B. Harper A.A. Taylor P.M. Rennie M.J. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 426: 121-128Google Scholar). Typical current recordings are shown at a holding potential (Vh) of –70 mV (Fig. 1B). The addition of Na+ and subsequently 10 mml-alanine had negligible effects in control oocytes, but both Na+ alone and Na+ plus l-alanine evoked inward currents in oocytes expressing SNAT1. Similar currents were obtained previously for SNAT2 except that the currents evoked by Na+ alone were significantly smaller for SNAT2 (26Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Google Scholar).Fig. 1SNAT1 mediates Na+-dependent amino acid transport.A, uptake of 100 μm [14C]MeAIB in control oocytes and oocytes expressing SNAT1, measured over 20 min at 23 °C in 100 mm NaCl or choline (Cho) chloride medium (pH 7.5). Data are mean ± S.E. for 15–16 oocytes in each group. B, typical continuous current recordings in a control oocyte and an oocyte expressing SNAT1. Oocytes were clamped at –70 mV and superfused with 100 mm ChoCl (blank boxes), then NaCl medium (hatched boxes), each at pH 7.5. 10 mml-alanine was applied as indicated by the black boxes before washing out with ChoCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Substrate Profile of the System A Transporters SNAT1 and SNAT2—To examine the substrate profile of SNAT1 we measured the currents evoked by a range of amino acids (each at 10 mm) at –70 mV (Fig. 2A). Currents were normalized to those evoked by l-alanine for which the half-maximal concentration (K0.5Ala) was 0.3 ± 0.02 mm (see Fig. 3B). SNAT1 preferred l-alanine over the d-isomer, primarily due to reduced apparent affinity (data not shown). SNAT1 transported small, neutral aliphatic amino acids that were ranked (based on absolute currents): l-cysteine, l-alanine, l-serine, l-asparagine, l-glutamine, l-histidine, glycine, l-methionine, l-threonine, MeAIB, and the imino acid l-proline. The 24 ± 5% reduction in current evoked by l-glutamine compared with l-alanine was a Vmax effect and not due to a reduction in apparent affinity ( K0.5Gln=0.3±0.03 mM, data not shown). However, the ratio Imax/K0.5 as an index of substrate selectivity was similar for l-alanine and l-glutamine (Fig. 2B). l-Threonine, an efficient substrate for System ASC, did not rank highly among SNAT1 substrates (Fig. 2A). SNAT1 did not exhibit significant reactivity with the charged amino acids l-arginine, l-aspartate, and l-lysine. l-Glutamate evoked very small currents but the very low affinity ( K0.5Glu≈11 mM, data not shown) and selectivity (Fig. 2B) indicate that SNAT1 is unlikely to represent a low affinity glutamate transporter described in the literature (12Kanai Y. Trotti D. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function and Regulation. 2e. Humana Press, Totowa2002: 255-311Google Scholar). SNAT1 essentially excluded the branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, l-leucine, and l-valine, although l-valine showed marginal reactivity), l-phenylalanine, l-tryptophan, and 2-aminobicyclo (2,2,1)heptane-carboxylate (BCH), a characterizing analogue for the System L and System B0+ amino acid transporters (31Mackenzie B. Harper A.A. Taylor P.M. Rennie M.J. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 426: 121-128Google Scholar, 32Vadgama J.V. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2912-2921Google Scholar, 33Van Winkle L.J.

Except where indicated for d-alanine, all test substrates were l-isomers; BCH, 2-aminobicyclo (2,2,1)heptane-carboxylate; MeAIB, 2-(methylamino)isobutyrate. Mean currents were compared between SNAT1 and SNAT2 with Student's t test: *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001. B, Imax/K0.5 (normalized to that for l-alanine) as an index of substrate selectivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We compared the substrate profile of SNAT1 with that of SNAT2 (26Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Google Scholar), a second System A subtype of the SLC23 gene family, exhibiting apparent affinities (e.g. K0.5Ala=0.2±0.03 mM) similar to those for SNAT1. We found only subtle differences between SNAT1 and SNAT2 in terms of substrate profile (Fig. 2A). SNAT2 displayed greater stereospecificity for the l-isomer (at least for alanine) than did SNAT1 but transported l-glutamine and MeAIB with less efficiency. The imino acid l-proline however is a better substrate for SNAT2 than for SNAT1 (see also Refs. 21Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Google Scholar, 26Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Google Scholar, and 34Albers A. Bröer A. Wagner C.A. Setiawan I. Lang P.A. Kranz E.U. Lang F. Bröer S. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 443: 92-101Google Scholar). l-Leucine is not a substrate for SNAT1 but displayed marginal reactivity with SNAT2.Uptake of [14C]MeAIB (Fig. 1A) was only about one-tenth of the uptake of l-[3H]alanine (data not shown) and MeAIB always evoked a current much smaller than that evoked by l-alanine in oocytes expressing SNAT1 or SNAT2 (Fig. 2A). This was primarily a result of a reduction in Vmax, since 10 mm MeAIB was effectively saturating despite a modest reduction in apparent affinity ( K0.5MeAIB=1.1±0.4 mM, data not shown). Selectivity for MeAIB was low compared with l-alanine or l-glutamine (Fig. 2B). Our data suggest that MeAIB binds to the System A transporters with reasonable specificity (see also Ref. 26Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22790-22797Google Scholar) but that architectural constraints significantly reduce the velocity at which MeAIB is transported. Whereas inhibition of radiotracer uptake by MeAIB (when used at appropriate concentrations) is a specific test for System A, our data demonstrate that MeAIB is not itself a model or paradigm substrate per se for System A since it is poorly translocated.Saturation Kinetics and Voltage Dependence of SNAT1-mediated Amino Acid Transport—We examined the voltage dependence and concentration dependence of the amino acid-evoked currents mediated by SNAT1 (Fig. 3). Amino acid-evoked currents are voltage-dependent, as illustrated for l-alanine and l-glutamine (Fig. 3A). Evoked currents varied with Vm in a linear fashion between –150 mV and –50 mV. Further slight reductions in current were observed at depolarized Vm (–30 mV, –10 mV), but currents persisted at positive Vm (up to +50 mV). Whereas l-glutamine is likely to be the principal substrate for the neuronal SNAT1 in vivo, we chose to conduct our subsequent experiments with l-alanine because of the appreciably larger currents obtained with l-alanine and its relative stability in aqueous solution.Alanine-evoked currents were saturable and followed Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics, with half-maximal concentration ( K0.5Ala, derived from Equation 1) around 0.3 mm in the presence of Na+ at –70 mV (Fig. 3B). The Hill coefficient for alanine (nHAla) was 1 and did not differ with Vm⋅K0.5Ala in Na+ was independent of Vm in the range –150 mV to –50 mV (Fig. 3C). The increase in K0.5Ala beginning at –30 mV and rising to 1.3 ± 0.2 mm by +50 mV should be expected since 100 mm Na+ was no longer sufficient to activate the system maximally at these Vm (see Fig. 3G). As for SNAT2 (data not shown), Li+ also supported alanine-evoked currents in the absence of Na+ but resulted in a reduction in maximal current (ImaxAla) of 45 ± 4% at –70 mV (Fig. 3B). Although the K0.5Ala was also higher in Li+ than in Na+ at –70 mV, it again reflected the subsaturating cation concentration (see Fig. 3G), whereas the K0.5Ala in Li+ did not differ from that in Na+ between –90 mV and –150 mV (Fig. 3C). We conclude that alanine binding per se is independent of voltage and independent of the driving ion (Na+ or Li+).The relationship of ImaxAla to Vm in Na+ medium was linear between –150 mV and –30 mV and linear again between –10 mV and +50 mV (Fig. 3D). For any given Vm, the alanine-evoked currents were greater at higher Na+ concentrations and the current/voltage relationships were shifted to the right (Fig. 3E). Amino acid transport mediated by SNAT1 is therefore driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient. Alanine-evoked currents were saturable with Na+ concentration (Fig. 3F), and the Hill coefficient for Na+ (nHNa) was 1, regardless of Vm. SNAT1 displayed extremely high apparent affinity for Na+. K0.5Na was exquisitely voltage-dependent, rising steeply from 2 ± 0.1 mm at –150 mV to almost 30 mm at –10 mV (indeterminable at positive Vm). We conclude that Na+ binding is voltage-dependent.Although the K0.5 for Li+ was even more steeply dependent upon Vm than was K0.5Na (Fig. 3G), the K0.5 for Li+ approached that for Na+ at hyperpolarized Vm and was not significantly different at –150 mV. We also noted that, at any given Vm, ImaxAla was always lower in Li+ medium than in Na+ (Fig. 3D). ( ImaxAla did not saturate at hyperpolarized potentials in Na+ but did in Li+, even at potentials at which Li+ is in excess (–150 mV to –110 mV). We conclude that the Vmax of the transporter is significantly limited when Li+ is the driving ion compared with Na+.SNAT1 is pH-sensitive, with amino acid transport being greatly inhibited at low pH (21Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Google Scholar, 22Chaudhry F.A. Schmitz D. Reimer R.J. Larsson P. Gray A.T. Nicoll R. Kavanaugh M. Edwards R.H. J.

We found that alanine evoked smaller currents at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.5 and no currents in the absence of Na+ at either pH (data not shown) indicating that H+ cannot activate amino acid transport in SNAT1. Consistent with this observation, SNAT1-mediated glutamine transport, although pH-sensitive, was independent of the H+ electrochemical gradient, as demons"

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 2364-2369Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The characteristic biochemical feature of CDG is defective glycosylation of proteins due to mutations in genes required for the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides.The attachment of oligosaccharide chains onto newly synthesized proteins is one of the most widespread forms of coand post-translational modifications and is found in animals, plants, and bacteria. Glycoproteins are located inside cells predominantly in subcellular organelles and in cellular membranes and most abundantly in extracellular fluids and matrices. The oligosaccharide moiety of the glycoproteins can affect their folding, their transport, as well as their biological activity and stability (2Spiro R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 3Helenius A. Aebi A. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). The complex process of protein glycosylation requires more than a hundred glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and transport proteins. CDG are classified into two groups. Defects of the assembly of lipid-linked oligosaccharides or their transfer onto nascent glycoproteins compose CDG type I, whereas CDG type II includes all defects of trimming and elongation of N-linked oligosaccharides (4First International Workshop on CDGS Glycoconj.

We show that the affected mannosyltransferase is the human ortholog to the yeast ALG2 gene, an enzyme that has so far not been characterized in higher eukaryotes. In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alg2-1 mutant a defect caused accumulation of Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol pointing to an involvement of ALG2 in mannose addition (25Huffaker C.

The (α1–6)-linkage in the Man(α1–6)Man(β1–4)GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol product formed was determined by incubation of the tetrasaccharide, released from the lipid by mild acid hydrolysis (30Knauer R.

Whereas in the case of α1–6-mannosidase treatment (1.1 milliunits of enzyme, 3.5 h of incubation), Man(α1–6)Man(β1–4)GlcNAc2 was converted to Man(β1–4)GlcNAc2, and no digestion was observed using α1–2,3-mannosidase (10 units of enzyme, 24 h of incubation). Incubation conditions were as suggested by the manufacturer.

Incubation was performed at 37 °C for the times indicated, stopped with chloroform/methanol to give a ratio of chloroform/methanol/water of 2:1:1 (by volume), and processed further as described above. The solubilized extract was obtained from a particulate fibroblast fraction prepared as described (23Thiel C. Schwarz M. Hasilik M. Grieben U. Hanefeld F. Lehle L. von Figura K. Körner C. Biochem.

Solubilization was carried out at a protein concentration of 7 mg/ml and 1% Nonidet P-40 as described above.Mutation Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from control and patient fibroblasts as well as from peripheral blood leukocytes of the parents using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of total RNA with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and the primer R1 (5′-GTGGCTCACATTCAAGACTCAA-3′). In a first round of PCR the cDNA was amplified using the primers F1 (5′-GGAGCTTGCGCAGAAGACCC-3′) and R1 using the HotStar-Taq-Polymerase kit (Qiagen) with a preincubation at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 28 cycles with 1 min at 94 °C, 0.5 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. Further amplification was carried out with the nested primers F2 (5′-GTGCAGTTGCGGCTCCAG-3′) and R2 (5′-CAAAACTGGGTCTACATACCATA-3′). Reverse transcriptase-PCR products were run on 1% agarose gels. The PCR fragments were prepared with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega GmbH).Sequence analysis of the PCR products and the plasmids was done by dye-determined cycle sequencing with the primers pUC M13 forward, pUC M13 reverse (Stratagene Europe), F2, Ex1-O (5′-TCCTGGCGCTCTACGTGCTGTT-3′), Ex2-L (5′-GGAGAATGTGGAACATTATCAGG-3′), R2 on a Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer.Genomic DNA was prepared from control and patient fibroblasts and from peripheral blood leukocytes of the parents by standard procedures (31Maniatis N.T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.21Google Scholar). PCR was carried out as described above with the primers intron A (5′-GGACATTCTTATGTATCAATATTAG-3′) and R1 in a first round of PCR and primers intron B (5′-GTGGCCAGAAAATCCACTTTTG-3′) and R2 in a second round of PCR. The PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and prepared as described above. Primer intron C (5′-GGCATATGGTACTGGGTGAGAG-3′) was used for sequencing for the G393T mutation and primer Ex2-L was used for the Δ1040G mutation.Site-directed Mutagenesis—A 1.3-kb fragment of a wild type ALG2-cDNA of the isoform representing the coding sequence (nucleotides –22 to 1310) was amplified by PCR using primers F2 und R2. The resulting fragment was purified and cloned into pGEM-T-easy vector (wild type). The mutation Δ1040G was inserted into the cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the primers Mut-A (5′-GCTGTTAATTCGGTGGACCCTTGGAG-3′) and Mut-B (5′-CTCCAAGGGTCCACCGAATTAACAGC-3′) to obtain plasmid pGEM-T-Easy-Pat. Wild type and patient ALG2-cDNA was subcloned into the Moloney mouse leukemia virus-derived vector pLNCX2 (Clontech).Production of Retroviruses—0.5 × 106 FNX-Eco cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes 1 day before transfection. Transient transfection by FuGENE6 reagent was carried out according to the manufacturer′s protocol (Roche Applied Science) with 1 μg of LNCX2 vector (mock), LNCX-wild type (wild type), and LNCX-Patient (Δ1040G), respectively. The further processing was carried out as described (23Thiel C. Schwarz M. Hasilik M. Grieben U. Hanefeld F. Lehle L. von Figura K. Körner C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The supernatant with the amphotropic retroviral particles was used to transfect the fibroblasts of the patient and the control. 24 h after the final infection of the fibroblasts, medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum with geneticin (335 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Selection was carried out for 10 days to obtain stable cell lines.Yeast Genetics—The cDNAs of the hALG2 from a control and patient M. S., cloned into the pBS-SK vector (Stratagene), were isolated as EcoRI 1260-bp fragments and ligated into the EcoRI site of the yeast shuttle vector pNEV-E (32Sauer N. Stolz J. Plant J. 1994; 6: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) under the control of the PMA1 promoter to give pNEV-ManTwt and pNEV-ManTpat, respectively. Plasmids were transformed into the alg2-1 strain (MATα ura3-52) using standard techniques (33Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YNBD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen dropout ura, 2% glucose).RESULTSCase Report—Patient M. S. is now a 3-year-old girl, the first child of healthy German parents. The family history was unremarkable on the paternal side, and on the maternal side there were several cases of a retarded psychomotor development, several early infantile deaths, cases with electroencephalogram abnormalities or seizures, and with migraine, as shown in the family tree (Fig. 1).The patient was born spontaneously without perinatal complications in the 36th week of an uneventful pregnancy. The birth weight was 3230 g. There were no postnatal complications, and the infant was thought to be normal up to the age of 2 months when her vision was suspected to be abnormal. An ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral colobomas of the iris and a unilateral cataract, which was removed and replaced by an artificial lens. Vision, however, seemed to remain very poor, as there was no fixation of objects or faces, and an irregular nystagmus was frequently present. From the age of 4 months, a seizure disorder appeared with infantile spasms and hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalogram tracings. At the age of 5 months, a cranial magnetic resonance tomography showed a severely retarded myelinization. A follow-up MRT at the age of 8 months showed that myelin formation had come to a standstill and that the volume of white matter was markedly reduced. Mental and motor development were both severely delayed, and tendon reflexes were brisk without distinct spasticity. Hearing was not impaired. With the exception of a coccygeal dimple, a faint cardiac murmur, and borderline enlargement of the liver, the remainder of physical findings were unremarkable.Extensive laboratory investigations failed to reveal any significant metabolic or hematological abnormality with the exception of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and a strongly reduced level of clotting factor XI.Because abnormalities of these parameters had been described in cases of CDG, investigations on the glycosylation state of serum transferrin by isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE were carried out.Isoelectric Focusing and SDS-PAGE of Serum Transferrin— The isoelectric focusing of serum transferrin, the standard diagnostic procedure for CDG, showed an increased amount of di- and asialo-transferrin at the expense of tetrasialo-transferrin, a pattern characteristic of CDG-I (Fig. 2, upper panel). Size determination of transferrin by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of faster migrating forms suggesting the absence of either one or both of the two N-glycan chains that are normally present in transferrin (Fig. 2, lower panel). The activity of phosphomannomutase and phosphomannose isomerase, which are missing in two of the most common forms of CDG, CDG-Ia and Ib, were found to be normal.Fig. 2Isoelectric focusing pattern and SDS-PAGE of serum transferrin. Samples from a control, a CDG-Ia patient, and patient M. S. (Pat M.S.) were analyzed by isoelectric focusing (upper panel) and SDS-PAGE (lower panel) followed by Western blotting and immunodetection of transferrin. Tetrasialo, disialo, and asialo on the upper panel indicate transferrin forms with four, two, or no sialic acid residues. 2, 1, and 0 on the lower panel indicate transferrin forms with two, one, or zero oligosaccharide chains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Analysis of Protein- and Dolichol-derived Oligosaccharides—To determine whether the loss of complete N-glycan chains in transferrin molecules of the patient was due to a reduced transfer of the oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 from dolichol-PP onto newly synthesized glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum by the oligosaccharyltransferase, [2-3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides were released from the total glycoprotein fraction by peptide:N-glycosidase F digestion and analyzed by HPLC. N-Glycans from control and patient fibroblasts eluted mainly at the positions of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 standards, respectively (Fig. 3, B and D). In the patient, the amount of 3H radioactivity in N-glycans was consistently reduced to about 70% of controls, although the oligosaccharyltransferase activity as well as the activities of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and II and dolichol-P-mannose synthase were not significantly altered (data not shown). Furthermore, the size of the oligosaccharides in the N-glycan fraction released from newly synthesized glycoproteins was normal (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3Analysis of dolichol- and protein-derived oligosaccharides in CDG-Ii. Fibroblasts from a control person (A) and the patient (C) were metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose for 30 min. 2-3H-Oligosaccharides were released from the dolichol-PP moiety by mild acid hydrolysis and size-fractionated by HPLC. M9G3 refers to the position of a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 standard. Glycoprotein-derived oligosaccharides from the control (B) and the patient (D) were prepared after metabolic labeling with [2-3H]mannose for 30 min. 2-3H-Oligosaccharides were released from the glycoprotein fraction by peptide:N-glycosidase F digestion and size-fractionated by HPLC. M9 and M9G1 refer to the positions of Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 standards, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Further investigations focused on the analysis of dolichollinked oligosaccharides, which so far have been observed to be truncated in all known CDG-I types, except CDG-Ib (7Niehues R.

Fibroblasts from control and patient were metabolically labeled with [2-3H]mannose, and the dolichol-linked oligosaccharides were extracted with a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10: 3). The glycan moiety was released by mild acid hydrolysis and analyzed by HPLC. The main peak fraction in control and the patient cells eluted with a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 standard (Fig. 3, A and C), although the amount of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 was slightly reduced in case of the patient.In order to examine the more hydrophobic dolichol-linked saccharides with short sugar chains that in part may have escaped the extract with chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3), we also analyzed the chloroform/methanol (3:2) extract of [2-3H]mannose-labeled fibroblasts by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 4). Besides radioactivity that comigrated with dolichol-P-mannose and non-migrating material at the origin, we observed in extracts from the patient fibroblasts two additional spots, which were supposed to be Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol and Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. For further characterization of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharides from the chloroform/methanol (3:2) extract, the oligosaccharide moieties were released by mild acid hydrolysis and analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5). In case of the patient two [2-3H]mannose-labeled oligosaccharides were observed. Their masses, 917.2 and 1079.2 Da, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight, corresponded to that of Man1GlcNAc2-1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolon and Man2GlcNAc2-1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolon, respectively.Fig. 4Thin layer chromatography analysis of short dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. Fibroblasts derived from a control person and patient M. S., respectively, were metabolically labeled for 30 min with [2-3H]mannose. Short lipid-linked oligosaccharides were extracted with chloroform/methanol (3:2) and further analyzed by TLC in a running buffer containing chloroform/methanol/H2O (65:25:4). The position of the origin, a [3H]mannose-P-dolichol standard, the assumed positions of [3H]Man1GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, and [3H]Man2GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis of short dolichol-linked [3H]mannose oligosaccharides.

The oligosaccharide moieties were released by mild acid hydrolysis, separated by HPLC, and subsequently analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The peak fractions were further investigated by mass spectrometry. The values beside the HPLC peaks indicate the detected masses.

https://openalex.org/W1973534594,"G-protein coupled receptors are not considered to exhibit voltage sensitivity. Here, using Xenopus oocytes, we show that the M2 muscarinic receptor (m2R) is voltage-sensitive. The m2R-mediated potassium channel (GIRK) currents were used to assay the activity of m2R. We found that the apparent affinity of m2R toward acetylcholine (ACh) was reduced upon depolarization. Binding experiments of [3H]ACh to individual oocytes expressing m2R confirmed the electrophysiological findings. When the GIRK channels were activated either by overexpression of Gβγ subunits or by injection of GTPγS, the ratio between the currents measured at –60 mV and +40 mV was the same as for the basal activity of the GIRK channel. Thus, the steps downstream to agonist activation of m2R are not voltage-sensitive. We further found that, in contrast to m2R, the apparent affinity of m1R was increased upon depolarization. We also found that the voltage sensitivity of binding of [3H]ACh to oocytes expressing m2R was greatly diminished following pretreatment with pertussis toxin. The cumulative results suggest that m2R is, by itself, voltage-sensitive. Furthermore, the voltage sensitivity does not reside in the ACh binding site, rather, it most likely resides in the receptor region that couples to the G-protein.

It is of common knowledge that voltage-gated ionic channels are voltage sensors; changes in membrane potential, usually depolarization, cause conformational changes in the channel protein, and, as a result, the channel opens. Ligand-gated channels also show voltage sensitivity, although much weaker, implying that these proteins also sense changes in membrane potential. Notable among them is the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (1Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. J. Physiol. 1984; 354: 29-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Nowak L. Bregestoski P. Ascher P.

Endocrine Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), are not considered to be voltage-sensitive. Surprisingly, voltage dependence was demonstrated in processes linked to one group of GPCRs, the muscarinic receptors. It was shown that m2R inhibits ACh release in a voltage-dependent manner; the inhibition is strong at resting potential and weakens upon depolarization (7Dolezal V. Tucek S. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 348: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Slutsky I. Parnas H. Parnas I. J.

In other studies it was shown, in mouse pancreatic acinar cells, that ACh-induced Ca2+ response, mediated by muscarinic receptors, is sensitive to the membrane potential (10Marty A. Tan P.A. J. Physiol. 1989; 419: 665-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Ong B.H. Ohsaga A. Sato K. Oshiro T. Shirato K. Maruyama Y. Pflugers.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29519-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or synaptoneurosomes (13Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was strong at resting potential and was reduced under depolarization achieved by increasing KCl concentration. Finally, electrical pulses were shown to reduce binding of muscarinic receptor antagonist to synaptosomes (14Luqmani Y.A. Bradford H.F. Birdsall N.J. Hulme E.C. Nature. 1979; 277: 481-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Important questions are whether the muscarinic receptors, representatives of the GPCRs, are by themselves voltage-sensitive, and if so, whether it is this sensitivity that underlies the above-mentioned voltage-dependent processes. However, so far this possibility was not directly investigated and was even not thoroughly considered. To be able to directly test this possibility we used an expression system, Xenopus laevis oocytes, which enables studying each receptor in isolation regarding its ability to sense changes in membrane potential. The results imply that m2R and, most likely, m1R exhibit, by themselves, voltage sensitivity. Preparation of cRNA and Oocytes—cDNA plasmids of the two subunits of the GIRK (GIRK1 and GIRK2), m2R, m1R, and the α, β, and γ subunits of the G-protein (Gαi3, Gβ1, and Gγ2) were linearized with the appropriate restriction enzymes (15Vorobiov D.

The linearized plasmids were transcribed in vitro using a standard procedure (16Dascal N. Lotan I. Methods Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 13: 205-225Google Scholar). X. laevis oocytes were isolated and incubated in NDE96 solution composed of ND96 (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes, with pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH) with the addition of 2.5 mm Na+ pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (16Dascal N. Lotan I. Methods Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 13: 205-225Google Scholar). A day after their isolation, the oocytes were injected with the relevant cRNAs. For the experiments with m1R, 200 pg of cRNA of m1R were injected per oocyte. For the experiments with m2R, cRNAs of m2R (70 pg) and GIRK1 and GIRK2 (200 pg each) were injected. In addition, cRNA of Gαi3 (1000 pg) was injected to decrease the basal GIRK current (IK) and to improve the relative activation by the agonist (17Peleg S. Veron D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Injection of Gαi3 proved to decrease IK by about 3-fold. Gβ1 and Gγ2 subunits were injected in the amounts indicated under “Results.” Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Israel (Rehovot, Israel), unless otherwise stated. Current Measurements—The currents were measured 4–7 days after cRNA injection and were recorded using the standard two-electrode voltage clamp technique (Axoclamp 2B amplifier, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Each oocyte was placed in the recording bath containing ND96 solution and was impaled with two electrodes pulled from 1.5-mm Clark capillaries (CEI, Pangboure, England). Both electrodes were filled with 100 mm KCl solution to prevent elevation of [K+]in (the recording and the injecting electrode resistances were 15 and 5 MΩ, respectively). The m2R-mediated GIRK currents were measured in a 24 mm K+ solution (in mm: 72 NaCl, 24 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes, with pH adjusted to 7.5 with KOH) (18Vorobiov D. Levin G. Lotan I. Dascal N. Pflugers. Arch. 1998; 436: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The m1R-mediated chloride currents were measured in ND96 solution. Current–voltage (I-V) curves were obtained by applying two 6-s voltage ramps from –100 mV to +40 mV and back to –100 mV. pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition and analysis. [3H]ACh Binding Experiments—Binding experiments were performed 3–4 days following cRNAs injection, employing a device that was designed to enable brief incubation periods (Fig. 1A). Standard pipetor tips (volumes up to 200 μl) were trimmed 4 mm from the edge, and a 3-cm-long glass pipette (2-mm outer diameter) was inserted to the cut tip end. The distal end of the glass pipette was fire-polished to prevent damage of the oocytes. The process of handling the oocyte is shown from left to right in Fig. 1A. The oocyte was first dropped (using the modified tips, which enable the lifting of the oocyte with a very small and accurate volume of solution) into a small chamber with 200 μl of either ND96 or high K+ (in mm: 2 NaCl, 96 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes, with pH adjusted to 7.5 with KOH) solution containing a given concentration of labeled ACh ([3H]acetylcholine iodide, specific activity, 80 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The oocyte was incubated in this solution for 30 s, a duration that was found to provide the maximal ratio between total and nonspecific binding (Fig. 1B, see below). For m1R-expressing oocytes, the optimal incubation time was found to be 60 s. Then the oocyte was removed from this chamber using the same modified tip, and rapidly dropped into a washing chamber filled with 4000 μl of ligand-free ND96 or high K+ solution. In less than a second the oocyte reached the bottom of the cone-shaped washing chamber. Using a second pipetor also with a modified tip, the oocyte, with 5 μl of the physiological solution, was rapidly removed through the side arm (an additional second), and was dropped into a vial containing 3 ml of scintillation liquid. To determine the optimal incubation time, total and nonspecific bindings were measured following various durations of incubation with [3H]ACh. As illustrated in Fig. 1B, both the total binding and the nonspecific binding increased as the duration of incubation was prolonged. With 10 s of incubation no specific binding was obtained. The maximal ratio between the total binding and the nonspecific binding was obtained when the oocytes were incubated for 30 s. Longer incubation durations yielded high nonspecific binding and, hence, decreased the signal-to-noise ratio. Specific binding was obtained by subtracting the nonspecific binding (uninjected oocytes) from the total binding. The specific binding was further ascertained, because it was abolished following the addition of 100 μm unlabeled (cold) ACh or 100 μm unlabeled atropine (antagonist of the various types of muscarinic receptor) to a solution containing 50 nm [3H]ACh (Fig. 1C). The number of binding sites expressed in the oocyte was determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the binding of the muscarinic receptors antagonist quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) to m2R-expressed oocytes. Fig. 1D shows that the specific binding of QNB is the same in ND96 and high K+ solution (∼20 fmol/oocyte). (A similar experiment was done with m1R-expressed oocytes.) Statistical Evaluation—Significance was checked by Student's two-tailed or one-tailed t test. Results are given as mean ± S.E. Membrane Potential Affects the Dependence of m2R-mediated GIRK Response on ACh Concentration—Xenopus oocytes were injected with cRNAs of proteins involved in the pathway leading to activation of K+ currents by m2R via βγ subunits of the G-proteins: m2R, the subunits of the GIRK channel (GIRK1 and GIRK2), and the Gαi3 subunit (17Peleg S. Veron D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). GIRK channels are inward rectifiers: they conduct inward K+ currents better than outward. Fig. 2A shows a typical current-voltage (I-V) relation of the basal K+ current (IK-V) via the expressed GIRK channels in a high K+ solution (24 mm K+). IK is believed to arise due to the presence of free endogenous Gβγ (19Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The IK-V relation is linear at potentials more negative than –50 mV, and inward rectification occurs at more positive potentials. We then wished to investigate whether there is additional voltage sensitivity in m2R-induced response. To this end, the dependence of the ACh-induced K+ current (IACh) on ACh concentration (dose-response, DR) was measured at two holding potentials: –60 mV and +40 mV. Fig. 2 (B and C) depicts the basic experimental protocol for one ACh concentration. The oocyte was voltage-clamped to either –60 mV (Fig. 2B) or +40 mV (Fig. 2C), in a low K+ (2 mm K+) solution, ND96. IK was developed upon replacement of the ND96 by the 24 mm K+ solution. Then, ACh (100 nm) was added, and IACh appeared. IACh was terminated upon washout of ACh. Finally, returning to ND96 solution abolished IK. Employing this basic experimental protocol, full DR curves at the two holding potentials were constructed. To compensate for the intrinsically different IK obtained at the two holding potentials of –60 mV and +40 mV in a single oocyte, and to be able to compare between oocytes varying in their IK-V relation, we measured fractional IACh. That is, for each holding potential, IACh at any particular ACh concentration was normalized to IACh obtained at a saturating concentration of ACh at the same holding potential. One way to construct DR curves is to apply various concentrations of ACh in a random order and wash out the ACh between applications. However, such protocols require periods of recording that may exceed the time when the oocytes are still viable. We have, therefore, applied the various ACh concentrations in an increasing order without washing out between applications. Such a continuous exposure to ACh may distort the true DR curve, because IACh is known to desensitize (20Kim D. J. Physiol. 1991; 437: 133-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Bunemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. 1996; 494: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Shui Z. Khan I.A. Tsuga H. Haga T. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To check whether this is the case under our experimental conditions, the following experiment was conducted (Fig. 3A). Three concentrations (15, 100, and 10,000 nm) of ACh were applied, and the ratio between IACh induced by 15 nm and IACh induced by 10,000 nm, was measured. Then, ACh was washed out for 4 min and only the lowest and the highest ACh concentrations were reapplied without the intermediate concentration, and again the ratio between IACh (15 nm) and IACh (10,000 nm) was measured. In both cases, a ratio of 0.2 was found (similar results were obtained in two additional experiments), indicating that the presence of 100 nm ACh prior to application of 10,000 nm did not diminish, or affect in any other way, the IACh induced by 10,000 nm ACh. Another problem that may arise concerns the duration of the experiments. Even without wash between ACh applications, an experiment during which four concentrations of ACh are applied at two holding potentials lasts about 20 min. As seen in Fig. 3B (see also Ref. 18Vorobiov D. Levin G. Lotan I. Dascal N. Pflugers. Arch. 1998; 436: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), during such a period of time, IK itself undergoes changes, its amplitude declines. Hence, a DR curve measured at the beginning of the experiment may differ from that measured at a later time during the experiment. To check for this possibility, we established a DR curve, then washed with ACh-free 24 mm K+ solution for 10 min, and the same DR was established again. It can be seen (see Fig. 3B) that IK indeed declined with time and, in correlation with this reduction, IACh increased with time. However, when IACh at any ACh concentration was normalized to the maximal IACh obtained with 10,000 nm ACh, the DR curves were remarkably similar before and after the 10-min wash. The responses to 5, 15, and 30 nm were 8, 15, and 45% of the maximal response, respectively, at the first application, and 6, 15, and 43% of the maximal response after the 10-min wash (similar results were obtained in two additional experiments). Next, full DR curves at two holding potentials were established. In the example of Fig. 4A, the oocyte was first voltage-clamped to –60 mV. Following the appearance of IK, ACh concentrations of 15, 30, 60, and 10,000 nm were applied in an ascending order (Fig. 4A, ACh 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). As mentioned before, for each holding potential, IACh at any ACh concentration was normalized to IACh obtained at 10,000 nm ACh at the same holding potential. 10,000 nm was selected as a reference concentration, because at this concentration saturation is reached even at the depolarizing (+40 mV) holding potential (20,000 nm ACh did not produce an additional response at either holding potential). The corresponding responses to 15, 30, and 60 nm were 20, 45, and 59% of the response to 10,000 nm. Following wash with ACh-free 24 mm K+ solution, the holding potential was switched from –60 mV to +40 mV, and the same ACh concentrations as for the holding potential of –60 mV were reapplied (framed by the dashed-line rectangle in Fig. 4A and shown at higher resolution in Fig. 4B). At +40 mV we could not detect any IACh at 15 nm ACh, even though currents as small as 5 nA are clearly detectable with our experimental system. Had the response evoked by 15 nm ACh been 20% of IACh at 10,000 nm,asitwasat –60 mV, the current would have been 80 nA and thus easily detectable. Furthermore, the response to 30 nm was only 11% (in comparison to 45% at –60 mV) and the response to 60 nm was 32% (in comparison to 59% at –60 mV) of the response to 10,000 nm ACh. Similar experiments were done on 45 oocytes taken from 16 X. laevis females. The order of the holding potentials was randomly selected, i.e. first +40 mV and then –60 mV or vice versa. The results of all these experiments are depicted in Fig. 4C where full DR curves obtained at –60 mV (squares) and +40 mV (triangles) are shown. The shift to the right of the DR curve at +40 mV is clear (The two graphs are significantly different (p < 0.05)). The shift in apparent affinity at +40 mV may be caused by cellular changes due to the long depolarization, rather than by a specific effect of depolarization on the m2R system. To check for this possibility, in some of the experiments, after measuring a DR curve at –60 mV, the holding potential was switched to +40 mV for a period of 10 min. Then, the holding potential was switched again to –60 mV and a DR curve was measured again. Results from three such experiments are depicted in Fig. 4D. It is evident from this figure that the DR curves established at –60 mV before (squares) and after (circles) the depolarization period were practically identical, indicating that depolarization as such did not cause any damage or any other long lasting effect on the DR relation. Another possibility to explain the shift in the DR curves would be that voltage-gated channels existing in the oocyte relay changes in membrane potential to m2R (23Cohen-Armon M. Garty H. Sokolovsky M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Oocytes often possess endogenous atypical voltage-gated Na+ channels of an unknown molecular origin. They are dormant at rest but can be induced into a functional state by long lasting depolarization (24Baud C. Kado R.T. J. Physiol. 1983; 356: 275-289Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To avoid a possible effect of these channels on the obtained results, each batch of oocytes was checked for the existence of such Na+ channels, employing standard protocols (24Baud C. Kado R.T. J. Physiol. 1983; 356: 275-289Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), prior to conduction of the DR experiments. Batches that were found to posses those channels were discarded. Membrane Potential Affects the Dependence of the m2R-mediated GIRK Response on Oxotremorine Concentration—Binding experiments, employing [3H]ACh, conducted in synaptosomes (12Ilouz N. Branski L. Pranis J. Parnas H. Linial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29519-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or synaptoneurosomes (13Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), revealed that the m2Rs comprise two affinity states, and depolarization shifts the high affinity population into a low affinity state. Yet the DR curves, obtained using ACh (Fig. 4C), did not reveal the existence of the two affinity states. Because this aspect is important for the analysis of the DR curves, we repeated the DR experiments with another muscarinic receptor agonist, oxotremorine (OXO), hoping that DR curves with OXO as an agonist will reveal the two affinity states populations. Fig. 5 reveals that, with OXO as an agonist, the high and low affinity populations that comprise m2R (12Ilouz N. Branski L. Pranis J. Parnas H. Linial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29519-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) became apparent. It is further seen that at –60 mV the two populations coexist, whereas at +40 mV the low affinity population predominates. This observation indicates that as in synaptosomes and synaptoneurosomes (12Ilouz N. Branski L. Pranis J. Parnas H. Linial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29519-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also in oocytes, where m2R is expressed in isolation, depolarization shifts the high affinity population into a low affinity state (see “Discussion” for more details) The observed dependence of the DR curves of either ACh or OXO on membrane potential may reside in any one of the following steps and/or components participating in the GIRK channel activation: 1) binding of ACh to m2R and consequent activation of the coupled G-protein; 2) GDP/GTP exchange and consequent dissociation of the G-protein into activated Gα subunit and Gβγ dimer; and 3) activation of the GIRK channel by the Gβγ subunits. To examine whether it is the receptor that is voltage-sensitive, the steps that are downstream to step 1), i.e. steps 2) and 3), were isolated, and the voltage dependence of the GIRK channels activation by factors downstream to m2R activation was tested. Activation of GIRK Channels by Overexpression of Gβγ Is Not Voltage-sensitive—It is possible that Gβγ not only activates the GIRK channels, but, as suggested recently (25Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), high levels of Gβγ also directly affect the rectification properties of the channel (possibility 3). Such a behavior could cause an increase in outward currents at high doses of ACh, producing the results seen in Figs. 4C and 5 (however, this still cannot explain the absence of any response at +40 mV at 15 nm ACh). To test for this possibility, we expressed several concentrations of Gβγ subunits in the oocytes together with the GIRK channel, but without m2R. IK was measured at –60 mV and +40 mV, and the ratio IK(–60)/IK(+40) was calculated for oocytes expressing the GIRK channels alone (control, CTRL), and for oocytes coexpressing the Gβγ subunits. It is seen (Fig. 6A), that overexpression of the Gβγ subunits indeed increases IK at both –60 mV and +40 mV in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the ratio IK(–60)/IK(+40) is similar in control and in Gβγ-overexpressed oocytes (Fig. 6C). To be able to compare results from various oocytes showing natural scatter in the IK(–60)/IK(+40) ratio, the average ratio obtained from control oocytes of the same batch was taken as 1 and the rest of the data points (of the individual control oocytes as well as the oocytes expressed with Gβγ) were normalized to this value. It is possible that by overexpression we did not reach sufficiently high concentrations of Gβγ subunits and therefore could not observe the changes in inward rectification of IK seen in a previous study (25Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This seems unlikely, because IK obtained with the highest concentration of Gβγ (5000 pg/oocyte) reached a level of 10,000 nA in –60 mV, which is in the same range of IK plus IACh obtained with the saturated concentration of ACh. Nevertheless, to check for this possibility directly, we compared the IK-V relation to the IACh-V relation induced by saturating concentration of ACh, 10 μm. IACh-V was normalized to IK-V by taking the corresponding currents at –90 mV to be equal. Fig. 2A shows that the two I-V curves are virtually the same, indicating that activation of the GIRK channel by the highest concentration of Gβγ employed in our experiments did not alter the I-V relation. We may therefore conclude that under our experimental conditions the m2R-mediated voltage sensitivity seen in Figs. 4C and 5 is not caused by direct effects of the Gβγ subunits on the properties of the GIRK channel. Activation of GIRK Channels by Injection of GTPγS Is Not Voltage-sensitive—The shift in apparent affinity seen at +40 mV (Fig. 4C) could be achieved if GDP/GTP exchange and the consequent dissociation of the G-protein into α and βγ subunits would be voltage-dependent. To isolate this step, the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, GTPγS, was injected into oocytes expressing the GIRK channels prior to the recording. Five min later, IK at –60 mV and +40 mV was measured, and the ratio IK(–60)/IK(+40) was determined as described above. It can be seen that injection of the oocytes with 200 pmol of GTPγS increased IK at both holding potentials (Fig. 6B). However, the ratio IK(–60)/IK(+40) after the injection of GTPγS is similar to the ratio obtained in control oocytes that were not injected with GTPγS (Fig. 6C). The magnitude of IK in oocytes injected with GTPγS was in the same range of IK plus IACh obtained with moderate concentrations of ACh. We could not inject higher concentration of GTPγS, because the oocytes did not survive such injections. The cumulative results support the conclusion that the steps downstream to the agonist activation of m2R are not voltage-sensitive. Effect of Depolarization on the Binding of [3H]ACh to Oocytes Expressing m2R—To directly examine whether it is the first step in the signal transduction, the binding of agonist to m2R (step 1 above), which is voltage-sensitive, we measured binding of [3H]ACh to oocytes expressing m2R. Although earlier studies, conducted in complex systems (synaptoneurosomes (13Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and synaptosomes (12Ilouz N. Branski L. Pranis J. Parnas H. Linial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29519-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) revealed that binding of [3H]ACh to muscarinic receptors was strong at resting potential and was reduced under depolarization, the cause of this phenomenon was either attributed to voltage-gated Na+ channels (13Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or was not at all investigated (12Ilouz N. Branski L. Pranis J. Parnas H. Linial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29519-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To maximize specific binding of [3H]ACh, large quantities of m2R cRNA (1000 pg) were injected, yielding ∼20 fmol of binding sites/oocyte (as measured by the muscarinic receptor antagonist QNB, Fig. 1D). Changes in membrane potential were induced by modifying the extracellular KCl concentration and were measured with standard intracellular microelectrod"
https://openalex.org/W2085609136,"Abstract The human copper chaperone HAH1 transports copper to the Menkes and Wilson proteins, which are copper-translocating P-type ATPases located in the trans-Golgi apparatus and believed to provide copper for important enzymes such as ceruloplasmin, tyrosinase, and peptidylglycine monooxygenase. Although a substantial amount of structural data exist for HAH1 and its yeast and bacterial homologues, details of the copper coordination remain unclear and suggest the presence of two protein-derived cysteine ligands and a third exogenous thiol ligand. Here we report the preparation and reconstitution of HAH1 with Cu(I) using a protocol that minimizes the use of thiol reagents believed to be the source of the third ligand. We show by x-ray absorption spectroscopy that this reconstitution protocol generates an occupied Cu(I) binding site with linear biscysteinate coordination geometry, as evidenced by (i) an intense edge absorption centered at 8982.5 eV, with energy and intensity identical to the rigorously linear two-coordinate model complex bis-2,3,5,6-tetramethylbenzene thiolate Cu(I) and (ii) an EXAFS spectrum that could be fit to two Cu–S interactions at 2.16 A, a distance typical of digonal Cu(I) coordination. Binding of exogenous ligands (GSH, dithiothreitol, and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine) to the Cu(I) was investigated. When GSH or dithiothreitol was added to the chaperone during the reconstitution procedure, the resulting Cu(I)– HAH1 remained two-coordinate, whereas the addition of the phosphine during reconstitution elicited a three-coordinate species. When the exogenous ligands were titrated into the Cu(I)–HAH1, all formed three-coordinate adducts but with differing affinities. Thus, GSH and dithiothreitol showed weaker binding, with estimated KD values in the range 10–25 mm, whereas tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine showed stronger affinity, with a KD value of <5 mm. The implications of these findings for mechanisms of copper transport are discussed."

Mutation analysis of GPHN exons in hyperekplexia patients revealed a missense mutation (A28T) in one patient causing an amino acid substitution (N10Y). Functional testing demonstrated that GPHNN10Y does not disrupt GlyR-gephyrin interactions or collybistininduced cell-surface clustering. We provide evidence that GlyR-gephyrin binding is dependent on the presence of an intact C-terminal MoeA homology domain.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 1049-1056Google Scholar). Inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) are composed of three ligand-binding α1 subunits (GlyR α1) and two structural β subunits (GlyR β) that are anchored and clustered on the postsynaptic membrane of inhibitory neurons by the interaction of a motif within the TM3-TM4 loop of the GlyRβ subunit with anchoring protein, gephyrin (6Langosch D. Hoch W. Betz H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 113-117Google Scholar, 7Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Google Scholar, 8Kneussel M. Hermann A. Kirsch J. Betz H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1323-1326Google Scholar). In contrast to GlyRs, there is a lack of evidence for a direct physical interaction between gephyrin and GABAA receptor subunit(s) (7Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D. Neuron. 1995; 15: 563-572Google Scholar, 9Kannenberg K. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1352-1360Google Scholar), although immunohistochemical studies have detected co-localization of gephyrin with major subtypes of GABAA receptors at GABAergic postsynaptic sites in murine and rat brain (10Essrich C.

Gephyrin (GPHN) belongs to a group of cytoskeletal elements that are critical for receptor-associated synaptic localization and organization. First identified as a 93-kDa protein by co-purification with GlyRs from rat spinal cord, GPHN demonstrated high affinity binding to tubulin (15Pfeiffer F. Graham D. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9389-9393Google Scholar, 16Graham D. Pfeiffer F. Simler R. Betz H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 990-994Google Scholar, 17Kirsch J. Langosch D. Prior P. Littauer U.Z. Schmitt B. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22242-22245Google Scholar). It is suggested that gephyrin forms a postsynaptic organizational lattice structure that dynamically immobilizes and clusters inhibitory receptors onto the cytoskeletal infrastructure (14Kneussel M. Betz H. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 1-9Google Scholar, 18Meier J. Vannier C. Serge A. Triller A. Choquet D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 253-260Google Scholar). In support of this, GPHN-dependent postsynaptic clustering of GlyRs was demonstrated by cellular antisense experiments and from studies of a gphn knock-out mouse model (12Kneussel M. Brandstatter J.H. Laube B. Stahl S. Muller U. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9289-9297Google Scholar, 19Kirsch J. Wolters I. Triller A. Betz H. Nature. 1993; 366: 745-748Google Scholar, 20Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kuhse J. Betz H. Sanes J.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Google Scholar). Heterogeneous roles for gephyrin have been implicated by protein-protein interactions with a range of determinants such as RAFT1, tubulin, profilin, collybistin, and the dynein light chains 1 and 2 (17Kirsch J.

Triller A. Betz H. Kneussel M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5393-5402Google Scholar). The preliminary structure of the gephyrin gene (GPHN) has been described in mice and humans (25Ramming M. Kins S. Werner N. Hermann A. Betz H. Kirsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10266-10271Google Scholar, 26Rees M.I. Am. Soc. Hum.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 271: 239-245Google Scholar), although there is a degree of ambiguity in the number of exons due to the presence of multiple transcript isoforms, and it is uncertain that all exons have been located and identified. Indeed, GPHN expression is not restricted to rat brain and spinal cord but is also found in liver, kidney, lung, and retina (28Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Google Scholar, 29Sassoe-Pognetto M. Kirsch J. Grunert U. Greferath U. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Betz H. Wassle H. J. Comp.

Gephyrin knock-out mice and reconstitutive cell culture assays have demonstrated that gephyrin expression in nonneuronal tissue is a requirement for the biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor (20Feng G. Tintrup H. Kirsch J. Nichol M.C. Kuhse J. Betz H. Sanes J.R. Science. 1998; 282: 1321-1324Google Scholar, 31Stallmeyer B. Schwarz G. Schulze J. Nerlich A. Reiss J. Kirsch J. Mendel R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1333-1338Google Scholar). Striking homologies are observed between the primary structure of GPHN and proteins involved in bacterial, plant, and invertebrate molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. Gephyrin, therefore, has a synaptic function as a postsynaptic anchoring and clustering protein in neurons while facilitating a highly conserved metabolic purpose in nonneuronal tissues (32Kirsch J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 329-335Google Scholar). The genetic and structural basis of the functional dichotomy is not established; however, in rats, a putative explanation may lie in the generation of distinct transcript isoforms of gephyrin constructed from alternative splicing of eight exonic “cassettes” within four regions of GPHN (25Ramming M. Kins S. Werner N. Hermann A. Betz H. Kirsch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10266-10271Google Scholar, 28Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K.

Apart from conferring neuronal and nonneuronal characteristics to the mature polypeptide products, the purpose of the transcript heterogeneity pattern is unclear, and the number of isoform combinations in human tissue remains unestablished. In addition to major disruption of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, gephyrin-deficient mice display a neuromotor phenotype, which resembles human hereditary hyperekplexia. This neurological condition (Mendelian Inheritance of Man: 149400 and 138491) can be caused by dominant and recessive mutations in the GLRA1 and GLRB receptor genes and is characterized by an abnormal, persistent startle response to unexpected stimuli, neonatal hypertonia, and a chronic accumulation of injuries caused by unprotected, startle-induced falls (34Shiang R.

Adv. Neurol. 2002; 89: 153-159Google Scholar). Furthermore, autoimmunity to GPHN was detected in a patient with Stiff-Man syndrome, a disorder that has a degree of phenotypic overlap with hyperekplexia (41Butler M.H. Hayashi A. Ohkoshi N. Villmann C. Becker C.M. Feng G. De Camilli P. Solimena M. Neuron. 2000; 26: 307-312Google Scholar). Collectively, this indicates that GPHN is a candidate gene for neurological and metabolic disorders, and support for the latter has recently emerged with a description of a GPHN reading frame mutation in a family with hereditary molybdenum cofactor deficiency (42Reiss J. Gross-Hardt S. Christensen E. Schmidt P. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 208-213Google Scholar). In response to the candidacy of gephyrin for hyperekplexia, we pursued the definitive genomic structure of gephyrin by a combination of in silico BAC contig construction and multitissue RT-PCR methods. Using a yeast two-hybrid (YTH) screen, with the GlyR β subunit intracellular loop as bait, we attempted to identify further GlyR-interacting proteins that might be implicated in hyperekplexia. The results of this screen, together with the extensive search for all human GPHN transcripts in both neuronal and nonneuronal tissues, suggest the presence of one new GPHN exon and at least 11 neurological transcript isoform combinations that redefine the genomic organization of GPHN. Having established the number of exons in the GPHN gene, we completed a systematic exon by exon mutation analysis of GPHN in a cohort of hyperekplexia patients devoid of GLRA1 and GLRB mutations. One novel mutation (N10Y) and several SNPs are reported; however, the functional effect of the mutation remains elusive despite assays for receptor targeting and clustering. We also present evidence that GlyR-gephyrin binding is dependent on the presence of an intact C-terminal MoeA homology domain and that the heterogeneous GPHN linker region is not the physical determinant for gephyrin-GlyR binding. RT-PCR Analysis of GPNH Alternative Splicing—A GPHN gene-specific primer (Table I) was used in a first-strand cDNA synthesis reaction (SuperScript II; Invitrogen) from total RNA derived from adult brain, fetal brain, cerebellum, and human spinal cord (Clontech). In addition to neurological tissue, cDNA was synthesized from a selection of nonneurological tissues including heart, liver, lung, kidney, trachea, fetal liver, pancreas, and placenta (Clontech). In the first instance, exonic primers were designed in constitutional regions surrounding the candidate regions of alternative splicing, namely regions C1/2, C3, C4/5, and C6/7 (Table I). To validate the initial RT-PCR methodology, downstream nested primers within the GPHN spliced exons were used in conjunction with primers from upstream invariant portions of the GPHN message (Table I). In the presence of multiple PCR products, DNA fragments were cloned into pGEM-Easy vectors (Stratagene), and the transformants were PCR-screened and assessed for size differences by molecular screening agarose (Roche Applied Sciences) and 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (Sigma). Minipreparations of clones were digested with EcoRI, and inserts were sequenced using ABI 3100 technology.Table IRT-PCR primers for the spliced regions of GPHNAssayForward primer 5′ → 3′Reverse primer 5′ → 3′Exonic 1st StrandSynthesis Primerex26GTTCTTGGTGATGCCAAGTTAGTATRegion C1/25′-UTRCTTCTCTGGCTCCCTAGCTGTCCTGGCAGGTTAATTATGAGCex6Region C3ex7CAGTGGTGTTGCTTCAACAGAGCGATTCTGAAGGAGTAGTGCex9Region C4/5ex9ACTCCATCATTTCTCGTGGTGTCAGAGGAAAAGGAGACATGCex14Region 6/7ex17ATCGTTTCATCATTGGGGAATATTCCCTGTTGACATGACTGCex20Combinatory C3-C4ex7CAGTGGTGTTGCTTCAACAGATCAGAGGAAAAGGAGACATGCex14Invariant 1ex14AACATTCTCAGAGCCATCACACGGACAGCATAGCCATCTTTTex18Invariant 2ex20ATCGCCATGACATTAAAAGAGTGATCCTCGTCCAGAATACCAex26Nested C3-C4Aex7CAGTGGTGTTGCTTCAACAGATTTGAGGGATCCAACC4ANested C3-C4Bex7CAGTGGTGTTGCTTCAACAGAATTTACTCTGAGAGAC4BNested C3-C4Cex7CAGTGGTGTTGCTTCAACAGACTCAGATACACTATAC4CNested C3-C4Dex7CAGTGGTGTTGCTTCAACAGATCTTAAGTCGTAGCCC4D Open table in a new tab YTH Screening—To identify GlyR β subunit interactors in human brain, we cloned the large intracellular loop of the human GlyR β subunit into the plasmid vector pYTH9 (43Handford C.A.

BioTechniques. 1998; 25 (90–92): 85-88Google Scholar). In this manner, the large TM3-TM4 intracellular loop (known to harbor a gephyrin binding motif) (8Kneussel M. Hermann A. Kirsch J. Betz H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1323-1326Google Scholar) was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. pYTH9 is advantageous for YTH screening, since the bait plasmid can be stably integrated into the yeast genome at the trp-1 locus. An adult human brain cDNA library in pACT2 (HL4004AH; Clontech) was be screened by transformation of library DNA into the pYTH9-GlyR β yeast strain. Transformed yeast were plated on selective dropout media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, supplemented with 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product. Transformation plates were incubated at 30 °C for 12 days to allow histidine prototropic colonies to emerge. Surviving colonies were restreaked onto selective agar, lifted onto Whatman 54 paper, and screened for protein-protein interactions using a standard freeze-thaw fracture assay for the lacZ reporter gene (44Fuller K.J. Morse M.A. White J.H. Dowell S.J. Sims M.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25 (90–92): 85-88Google Scholar). Library plasmid DNAs were recovered from β-galactosidase-positive colonies using the Yeastmaker plasmid isolation kit (Clontech), transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-blue (Stratagene), miniprepped, and sequenced. True interactions were checked by retransformation of library plasmids into yeast containing pYTH16 (an episomal version of pYTH9) and pYTH16-GlyR β. Library plasmids that were capable of autoactivation (i.e. activated lacZ with pYTH16 alone) were excluded from further analysis. Constructs, Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) Cell Transfection, and Confocal Microscopy—For the pDSRed-GlyR β construct, the large intracellular loop of the human GlyR β subunit was amplified using the primers BDSRed1 (5′-GCTGAATTCGCCACCATGGCAGTTGTCCAGGTGATGCT-3′) and BDSRed2 (5′-AACGGATCCCTTGCATAAAGATCAATTCGC-3′) and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pDSRed-N1 (Clontech). For the pEGFP-gephyrin construct, the entire coding region of the rat gephyrin P1 isoform (28Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Google Scholar) was amplified using the primers G1 (5′-CGCTGATCAACATGGCGACCGAGGGA-3′) and G14 (5′-TGGCTCGAGTCATAGCCGTCCGATGA-3′), cut with BclI and XhoI, and cloned into the BglII and SalI sites of pEGFPC2 (Clontech). The N10Y mutation was introduced into pEGFP-gephyrin by site-directed mutagenesis, using 27-mer oligonucleotides and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Collybistin cDNAs were amplified from postnatal (P0) rat brain first-strand cDNA using the primers CB1 (5′-GTGGGATCCATGCAGTGGATTAGAGGCGGA-3′) and CB3 (5′-TTAGAATTCTCTGCCTTCCTATAGGTATTA-3′ and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI and sites of the vector pRK5myc. The construct used in this study (pRK5mycCB2SH3–) encodes the collybistin II isoform (23Kins S. Betz H. Kirsch J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 22-29Google Scholar). All amplifications were performed using Pfu Turbo proofreading DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and DNAs for transfection were made using the Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). All constructs were sequenced using the BigDye ready reaction mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI 310 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). HEK cells (ATCC CRL1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units ml–1 penicillin G, and 100 mg ml–1 streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% air-5% CO2 (45Harvey R.J. Vreugdenhil E. Zaman S.H. Bhandal N.S. Usherwood P.N. Barnard E.A. Darlison M.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3239-3245Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were electroporated (400 V, infinite resistance, 125 microfarads; Bio-Rad Gene Electropulser II) with various combinations of three plasmid constructs: pDSRed-GlyR β, pEGFP-gephyrinN10Y, or pRK5myc-collybistin II. After 24 h, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 5 min in 4% (w/v) phosphonoformic acid (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline. Myc-tagged collybistin II was detected using an anti-9E10 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) using standard protocols. Confocal microscopy was performed as previously described (46Dunne E.L. Hosie A.M. Wooltorton J.R. Duguid I.C. Harvey K. Moss S.J. Harvey R.J. Smart T.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 29-38Google Scholar). In Silico Determination of Human Gephyrin Gene Structure—Rat cDNA (28Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1161-1170Google Scholar) and human expressed tag sites similar to rat gephyrin were submitted for BLAST searches (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Portions of rat cDNA fragments displayed 90–95% homology with dispersed regions of several chromosome 14 human genome BACs submitted to GenBank™. Exon/intron organization was established from the genomic BAC contig, and a putative promoter region was identified through sequence homologies. Details of the human GPHN gene have subsequently been described by David-Watine (27David-Watine B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 271: 239-245Google Scholar), and the BAC clones are accessible from GenBank™. Hyperekplexia Patients—The majority of patients included in the mutation analysis of the GPHN gene (n = 31) are described elsewhere (37Rees M.I. Lewis T.M. Kwok J.B. Mortier G.R. Govaert P. Snell R.G. Schofield P.R. Owen M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 853-860Google Scholar). In addition, a further seven unrelated hyperekplexia patients all exhibited to the diagnostic criteria of inclusion, which involves a history of neonatal hypertonia, a nose tap response, and an exaggerated startle response, leading to injurious fall down consequences with preservation of consciousness. PCR Analysis of GPHN in Hyperekplexia—The GPHN promoter region, exons and flanking intronic sequences, and 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were amplified from patient DNA. Primer sets were designed by Primer 3.0 criteria via the online facility (available on the World Wide Web at www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3.0). Each 25-μl reaction contained 60 ng of genomic DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 200 μm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Qiagen). Promoter regions were amplified with Expand Fidelity Taq (Roche Applied Science) accompanied by 10% (v/v) Me2SO (Sigma) because of the high GC content of the region. The DNA was amplified in MJ Research or PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocyclers. SSCP—Samples for screening were prepared by denaturing 5 μl of GPHN PCR products with 7 μl of formamide dye at 94 °C for 5 min. Samples were cooled and applied to 10% nondenaturing gels (49:1; Sigma) and run at 75 V for 12–16 h at room temperature and 4 °C. All SSCP gels were silver-stained as previously described (47Budowle B. Chakraborty R. Giusti A.M. Eisenberg A.J. Allen R.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 137-144Google Scholar). Bidirectional Dideoxy Fingerprinting (DDF) Analysis—DDF analysis was carried out using [α-33P]ddNTP/dNTP mixtures and thermosequenase reactions (Amersham Biosciences). DDF patterns for GPHN assays were resolved on MDE nondenaturing gels (48Sarkar G. Yoon H.S. Sommer S.S. Genomics. 1992; 13: 441-443Google Scholar, 49Liu Q. Feng J. Sommer S.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 107-114Google Scholar). dHPLC—Analysis was carried out using the Transgenomics dHPLC 2100 WAVER DNA Fragment Analysis System and DNASepR column (Transgenomic, Santa Clara, CA). The dHPLCMelt program was used to predict the optimal melting conditions for PCR fragments, which were analyzed on a WAVE DNA fragment analyzer at temperatures recommended by predicted helicity profiles across the DNA fragment. Variant dHPLC profiles suggestive of sequence heterogeneity were sequenced. The WAVE was run under partially denaturing conditions for mutation detection and SNP discovery. Wavemaker 4.0 software was used to control the rate of flow of buffers and column running. A volume of between 4 and 8 μl of patient and control PCRs were injected into the column depending on the DNA concentration of the PCR. DNA Sequencing—GPHN SNPs were detected by radionucleotide [α-33P] cycle sequencing. Sequencing was initiated using a denaturation stage at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of primer annealing temperatures at 55 °C for 30 s, primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s. Denatured samples were applied to a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Sigma) and resolved at 85 watts for 1–2 h at room temperature. The sequence content of RT-PCR products and clones were determined by ABI 3100 equipment using BigDYE chemistry (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each amplimer was sequenced with sense and antisense primers using an ABI PRISM™ BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Population Studies—The population frequency of identified sequence variations (potentially pathogenic mutations and SNPs) were established in a variable number of unrelated controls of Caucasian descent and derived from blood donor clinics in New Zealand (Table II). In instances where a restriction site change was predicted by the polymorphism, the relevant restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was designed and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For those SNPs devoid of restriction site changes, the SNP frequency in the normal population was determined by comparison of mutation profiles versus normal profiles using mutation screening techniques SSCP, DDF, or dHPLC (see Table II).Table IIPolymorphisms within GPHNSequence changesClassification of changePredicted consequenceFrequency in hyperekplexiaFrequency in controlsAssay-972 del (tgga)5′-UTR deletionUnknown1 from 31 (0.04)1 from 58 (0.02)SSCPC-772TSNPUnknown6 from 31 (0.20)7 from 38 (0.18)SSCPA28T (ex 1)Missense mutationN10Y1 from 310 from 94DDFIVS1 -9(T → C)SNPNo effect6 from 31 (0.20)7 from 32 (0.22)SSCPIVS3 -38(G → A)SNPNo effect5 from 31 (0.16)7 from 32 (0.22)ApoI RFLPIVS3 -6(T → C)SNPNo effect3 from 31 (0.10)2 from 32 (0.07)DDFT1851C (ex 22)SNPNo effect1 from 31 (0.04)1 from 48 (0.02)AatII RFLPIVS24 -38(G → T)SNPNo effect1 from 31 (0.04)2 from 32 (0.07)HincII RFLPIVS24 -14(A → T)SNPNo effect2 from 31 (0.07)5 from 48 (0.10)MboII RFLPIVS25 -59(C → T)SNPNo effect3 from 31 (0.10)5 from 48 (0.10)SSCP Open table in a new tab GlyR β Subunit YTH Screen—In an attempt to identify further GlyR-interacting proteins that may be implicated in hyperekplexia, we carried out a YTH screen of an adult human brain cDNA library, using the GlyR β subunit TM3-TM4 intracellular loop as bait. The cDNA library had an original complexity of 3.5 × 106 independent cDNA clones, and 8 × 106 cDNAs were screened. Twelve positive clones were recovered, which specifically interacted with the GlyR β subunit bait. These represented eight independent cDNAs encoding variants of the human homologue of GPHN (Fig. 1). No other interacting proteins were found. Some of our gephyrin cDNAs (e.g. Geph1) were full-length, which allowed us to predict the entire coding sequence of the human gephyrin polypeptide.

https://openalex.org/W2130943718,"We report the crystal structure of a murine IkappaBbeta x NF-kappaB p65 homodimer complex. Crystallographic models were determined for two triclinic crystalline systems and refined against data at 2.5 and 2.1 A. The overall complex structure is similar to that of the IkappaBalpha.NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer complex. One NF-kappaB p65 subunit nuclear localization signal clearly contacts IkappaBbeta, whereas a homologous segment from the second subunit of the homodimer is mostly solvent-exposed. The unique 47-amino acid insertion between ankyrin repeats three and four of IkappaBbeta is mostly disordered in the structure. Primary sequence analysis and differences in the mode of binding at the IkappaBbeta sixth ankyrin repeat and NF-kappaB p65 homodimer suggest a model for nuclear IkappaBbeta.NF-kappaB.DNA ternary complex formation. These unique structural features of IkappaBbeta may contribute to its ability to mediate persistent NF-kappaB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2055882175,"Engagement of Toll-like receptor (TLR) proteins activates multiple signal transduction pathways. These studies show that engagement of TLR2 and TLR4 leads to rapid phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT1 at serine 727 (Ser-727 STAT1) in murine macrophages. Only TLR4 engagement induced STAT1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 701, although this response was delayed compared with Ser-727 STAT1 phosphorylation. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase using LY294002 blocked TLR4-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, but this inhibitor had no effect on STAT1 serine phosphorylation. TLR-induced phosphorylation of Ser-727 STAT1 could be blocked by the selective p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580. However, activation of p38 was not sufficient to induce Ser-727 STAT1 phosphorylation in macrophages. TLR2-induced activation of Ser-727 STAT1 phosphorylation required the adapter protein MyD88, whereas TLR4-induced activation of Ser-727 STAT1 phosphorylation was not solely dependent on MyD88. Lastly, TLR4-induced activation of Ser-727 STAT1 phosphorylation could be blocked by rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C-δ. In contrast, rottlerin had no effect on STAT1 phosphorylation induced via TLR2. Together, these data demonstrate that activation STAT1 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation are distinct consequences of TLR engagement in murine macrophages. Furthermore, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C-δ, and a novel TLR2-specific signaling pathway appear to be necessary to induce Ser-727 STAT1 phosphorylation.

Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; IFN, interferon; Pam3Cys, S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2-RS)-propyl]-N-palmitoyl-(R)-Cys-(S)-Ser-Lys4-OH trihydrochloride; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IL, interleukin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PKC, protein kinase C. 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; IFN, interferon; Pam3Cys, S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2-RS)-propyl]-N-palmitoyl-(R)-Cys-(S)-Ser-Lys4-OH trihydrochloride; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IL, interleukin; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PKC, protein kinase C. are type I transmembrane receptors that are composed of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain and a highly conserved cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1R domain (1Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). These receptors are expressed on a variety of cell types, including dendritic cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells. TLR proteins are primary signal-transducing molecules responsible for recognizing specific microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (2Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6440) Google Scholar). A variety of diverse chemical structures has been identified for most of the ten known TLR proteins (reviewed in Ref. 3Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The activation of TLR proteins is believed to give rise to patterns of gene expression that are necessary to initiate both innate and adaptive immunity (4Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3939) Google Scholar, 5Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37692-37699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). TLR agonists are known to activate multiple signal transduction pathways simultaneously in target cells. These signaling events include activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, the MAP kinases, protein kinase C isoforms, and the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) (6Rhee S.H.

Another early signaling event in LPS-stimulated macrophages is the activation of the transcription factor STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1). Various cytokine receptors exploit STAT proteins to transduce ligand-induced signaling. The type I interferons (IFN-α/β) utilize STAT1 and STAT2 to transduce intracellular signals generated following engagement of a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the subunit chains, IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 (10Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar, 11Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). IFN-α/β receptor results in the cross-activation of the two receptor-associated Janus protein tyrosine kinases (Jaks), Tyk2 and Jak1, respectively. Thereby, activated Tyks and Jaks lead to the phosphorylation on Tyr-701 in STAT1 and STAT2, resulting in homodimeric (STAT1·STAT1), heterodimeric (STAT1·STAT2), or heterotrimeric (STAT1·STAT2·interferon regulatory factor-9) protein complexes. These multimeric complexes translocate to the nucleus where they bind to distinct DNA elements, finally leading to the activation of IFN-inducible gene expression (10Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar, 12Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3378) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr-701 alone is sufficient to generate STAT multimers that possess DNA binding activity (15Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), although phosphorylation of Ser-727 is required for maximal transcriptional activity of STAT1 (reviewed in Ref. 14Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanisms leading to STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation are not well understood. Several studies have reported that the p38 MAP kinase is necessary for STAT1 phosphorylation at Ser-727, but it is likely that STAT1 is not a substrate for p38 in living cells (14Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The studies presented below show that LPS induced TLR4-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 at both tyrosine and serine residues in murine macrophages. LPS-induced STAT1 Tyr-701 phosphorylation was mediated by a PI3K-dependent mechanism, whereas STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation was PI3K-independent. In contrast, macrophage activation via TLR2 induced phosphorylation of Ser-727, but not of Tyr-701, on STAT1. Furthermore, the adapter protein MyD88 was found to be necessary for STAT1 serine phosphorylation via TLR2 but not via TLR4. The p38 MAP kinase was necessary but was not sufficient for TLR-dependent activation of STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation. Moreover, specific inhibitors of PKC-δ were found to block STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation induced via TLR4 but not via TLR2. These studies revealed a novel difference in the mechanism of STAT1 phosphorylation induced by engagement of TLR2 and TLR4.

All assay were performed in triplicate, and a single representative experiment is shown. Data are expressed as mean values ± S.E. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and then lysed for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 × g. Protein concentrations of the lysate were measured by Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and an equal amount of total protein per lane was fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar).

The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the murine IFN-β PCR product were 5′-TCCAAGAAAGGACGAACATTCG-3′ and 5′-TGAGGACATCTCCCACGTCAA-3′ (annealing temperature, 55 °C). TLR Engagement Leads to Phosphorylation of STAT1—Previous reports have demonstrated that TLR signaling leads to the activation of MAP kinases and the transcriptions factors NF-κB and AP-1 in macrophages (6Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Carothers J. Xiao C. Douglas I. Janeway C.A. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2059-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies sought to determine whether engagement of TLR proteins also leads to the activation of the transcription factor STAT1. RAW264.7 murine macrophages were stimulated with the TLR4 agonist E. coli LPS, or with the synthetic lipopeptide TLR2 agonist Pam3Cys, for various times. Whole cell lysates were prepared, and lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting. STAT1 activation was measured using specific anti-bodies that discriminate between STAT1 phosphorylated at serine 727 and tyrosine 701. As shown in Fig. 1A, E. coli LPS was capable of inducing the phosphorylation of STAT1 at both serine and tyrosine residues. Pam3Cys was capable of inducing STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation with similar kinetics to LPS (Fig. 1B), but this TLR2 agonist was incapable of inducing STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). The inability of TLR2 agonists to induce STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported previously (20Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.-Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R.G. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) and is because of the inability of TLR2 agonists to induce IFN-β secretion and subsequent engagement of the type I IFN receptor. The kinetics of STAT1 serine phosphorylation were rapid and sustained, with maximal serine phosphorylation occurring in less than 30 min, whereas STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was both delayed and transient. Two distinct species of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 were observed, corresponding to STAT1α (92 kDa) and STAT1β (84 kDa). A single species of serine-phosphorylated STAT1 was observed, corresponding to STAT1α. The STAT1β splice variant lacks the C-terminal serine phosphorylation site present in STAT1α. In the figures, this serine-phosphorylated form of STAT1α will simply be referred to as P-S(727)STAT1. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was first observed ∼2 h after LPS stimulation, as reported previously (20Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.-Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R.G. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), and was substantially diminished by 10 h after LPS stimulation. This reduction in STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation coincided with an overall increase in total STAT1 levels and may reflect an overall increase in the total cellular content of STAT1. Alternatively, transient STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation may reflect the action of protein tyrosine phosphatases. These data reveal that engagement of TLR2 and TLR4 leads to the rapid serine phosphorylation of STAT1. Moreover, the distinct kinetics of STAT1 serine and tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that these events are consequences of distinct signal transduction pathways. To determine whether TLR4 was necessary for the activation of STAT1 serine phosphorylation, peritoneal macrophages from normal C3H/OuJ and TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice were stimulated in vitro with E. coli LPS for 20 and 40 min. STAT1 serine phosphorylation was measured using Western blotting as described above. As shown in Fig. 2A, STAT1 serine phosphorylation was strongly induced in the C3H/OuJ macrophages. In contrast, no induction of STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation was observed in the TLR4 mutant macrophages. One of our published studies (20Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.-Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R.G. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) has shown that TLR4 was also necessary for LPS-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In parallel studies, Pam3Cys was found to induce rapid STAT1 serine phosphorylation in macrophages from normal C57BL/6 mice but not from TLR2–/– mice (Fig. 2B). Together, these findings demonstrate that TLRs 2 and 4 are necessary for STAT1 activation by Pam3Cys and E. coli LPS, respectively. Lastly, STAT1 serine phosphorylation could still be induced rapidly in the TLR4 mutant C3H/HeJ macrophages by the TLR2 agonist Pam3Cys and in TLR2-deficient macrophages by the TLR4 agonist E. coli LPS (data not shown). PI3K Mediates TLR-induced STAT1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation but Not Serine Phosphorylation—A previous study (24Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) has reported that serine phosphorylation of STAT1 could be mediated by PI3K in IFN-γ-stimulated fibroblasts. We subsequently sought to determine whether STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation induced via TLR2 and TLR4 was also mediated by PI3K. To test this possibility, RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with E. coli LPS in the presence and absence of the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002. As shown in Fig. 3, STAT1 serine phosphorylation was not inhibited by LY294002, demonstrating that this pathway is not dependent on PI3K. In contrast, both STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphorylation of the PI3K-dependent kinase Akt were inhibited by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, STAT1 serine phosphorylation induced by Pam3Cys was not inhibited by LY294002, demonstrating that TLR2-dependent serine phosphorylation is not dependent on PI3K. Thus, PI3K mediates STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, activated via TLR4, but does not mediate serine phosphorylation in macrophages activated by engagement of TLR2 and TLR4. PI3K Does Not Mediate Induction of IFN-β Gene Expression by E. coli LPS—IFN-β has been shown previously (20Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.-Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R.G. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) to mediate LPS-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in macrophages. The finding that LY294002 could inhibit LPS-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation suggested that PI3K might be necessary for induction of IFN-β expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages. To determine whether PI3K plays a role in LPS-induced IFN-β production, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with E. coli LPS in the presence and absence of LY294002. Total RNA was then isolated from the cells 2 h later, and IFN-β mRNA levels were measured using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. As shown in Fig. 4A, LY294002 did not inhibit LPS-induced endogenous IFN-β mRNA expression. A second experimental approach was then used to confirm that PI3K does not mediate the activation of IFN-β gene expression. RAW264.7 cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid that encodes a constitutively active TLR4 mutant (TLR4-CA) and an IFN-β-luciferase reporter plasmid. In some cases, cells were also transfected with an expression plasmid encoding a dominant-negative (kinase-dead) mutant of the p85α regulatory subunit. As shown in Fig. 4B, the dominant-negative p85α mutant failed to block TLR4-induced IFN-β promoter activation in the transfected macrophages. The capacity of this dominant-negative p85α mutant to block activation of a PI3K-dependent promoter was confirmed in additional experiments using RAW264.7 cells co-transfected with an inducible nitric oxide synthase-luciferase reporter plasmid and the expression plasmid encoding the dominant-negative p85α mutant (data not shown). Together, these findings demonstrate that PI3K does not mediate activation of IFN-β gene expression by LPS and TLR4. PI3K Does Not Mediate STAT1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation Induced by Exogenous IFN-β—The finding that PI3K did not mediate the induction of IFN-β gene expression by LPS raised the alternative possibility that PI3K might be necessary for signaling via the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). To test this possibility, the capacity of LY294002 to block STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by exogenous IFN-β was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 5, exogenous IFN-β rapidly induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and LY294002 had a negligible effect on IFN-β-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that PI3K does not mediate STAT1 activation via IFNAR signaling. Given the findings that PI3K was not necessary for either LPS-induced IFN-β gene expression (Fig. 4) or IFNAR signaling (Fig. 5), these combined observations suggest that PI3K mediates LPS-induced IFN-β secretion by macrophages (although not specifically tested in our studies). This possibility is consistent with the findings of Ohmori and Hamilton (25Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 598-604PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that LY294002 lowered IFN-β secretion by LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, compared with controls (25Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 598-604PubMed Google Scholar). p38 MAP Kinase Mediates TLR-induced Serine Phosphorylation of STAT1—Although the identity of the protein kinase that phosphorylates STAT1 at serine residues in macrophages has not been established definitively (14Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), activation of serine STAT1 phosphorylation has been shown previously (27Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) to be dependent on the p38 MAP kinase. To evaluate the role of p38 in TLR-induced STAT1 serine phosphorylation, RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with the TLR2 and TLR4 agonists Pam3Cys and E. coli LPS, respectively, in the presence and absence of the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580. A concentration of SB203580 was used (20 μm) that completely blocked TLR-dependent activation of p38 in RAW264.7 cells, without affecting viability of the cells (data not shown). Whole cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-p38 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, SB203580 treatment inhibited serine STAT1 phosphorylation induced by both Pam3Cys and E. coli LPS. These findings demonstrated that p38 was necessary for TLR-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1. p38 MAP Kinase Activation Is Not Sufficient to Induce STAT1 Serine Phosphorylation—Because both TLR proteins and the type I IL-1 receptor activate similar signal transduction pathways, including the activation of MAP kinases (3Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), the capacity of exogenous IL-1β protein to activate STAT1 serine phosphorylation was also assessed. RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with recombinant murine IL-1β (100 ng/ml) for 10 and 20 min. The activation of p38 and STAT1 was measured by Western blotting as described above. As shown in Fig. 7, p38 phosphorylation was rapidly induced in the macrophages following IL-1β stimulation. In contrast, no induction of STAT1 serine phosphorylation was observed in the IL-1-stimulated macrophages, demonstrating that p38 activation is not sufficient for STAT1 activation. Together with the results shown in Fig. 6, these findings suggest that TLR engagement triggers the activation of a protein serine kinase that phosphorylates STAT1 in a p38-dependent manner. Both TLR agonists and IL-1β are capable of activating p38, although only TLR agonists can activate STAT1 serine phosphorylation in macrophages. Thus, this protein serine kinase appears to distinguish the IL-1 from the TLR signaling pathways in these cells. Alternatively, IL-1β may induce STAT1 serine phosphorylation while also activating a serine phosphatase that de-phosphorylates Ser-727. Role of PKC-δ in TLR-dependent Activation of STAT1 Serine Phosphorylation—Subsequent studies sought to determine the identity of the STAT1 serine kinase activated by engagement of TLR proteins. Several candidate kinases had been identified previously in macrophages, including isoforms of PKC. To evaluate the role of PKC isoforms in TLR-induced STAT1 serine phosphorylation, RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with the TLR2 and TLR4 agonists Pam3Cys and E. coli LPS, respectively, in the presence and absence of the pan-PKC-specific inhibitor bisindoylmaleamide or the PKC-δ-specific inhibitor rottlerin. Whole cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 8, both bisindoylmaleamide and rottlerin inhibited STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation induced by LPS but not Pam3Cys. Taken together, these data indicate that TLR2 and TLR4 engagement activates distinct STAT1 serine kinases and that the STAT1 serine kinase activated by E. coli LPS is a PKC family member, possibly PKC-δ. To obtain functional evidence of a role for PKC-δ in LPS-induced activation of STAT1, experiments were performed to determine whether a dominant-negative PKC-δ mutant could affect the trans-activation function of STAT1 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. RAW264.7 macrophages were transiently co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the STAT1-dependent IFN-β promoter, with and without an expression plasmid encoding a dominant-negative (kinase-dead) PKC-δ mutant (19Murakami M. Horowitz A. Tang S. Ware J.A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20367-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9A, E. coli LPS was a potent activator of the IFN-β promoter in macrophages, and overexpression of the PKC-δ dominant-negative mutant in these cells resulted in a 36% average reduction in promoter activity. This is consistent with an inhibition of STAT1 serine phosphorylation, which would be expected to reduce (but not abolish) the trans-activation function of STAT1. The specificity of this PKC-δ dominant-negative mutant was confirmed by the finding that this mutant did not affect activation of the NF-κB-dependent COX2 promoter by LPS (Fig.9B). Together, these data provide further evidence of a role for PKC-δ in STAT1-dependent promoter activation by LPS. Role of MyD88 in TLR-dependent Activation of STAT1 Serine Phosphorylation—The findings reported above demonstrated that STAT1 serine phosphorylation could be induced by engagement of TLR2 and TLR4 but not by IL-1β. The adapter proteins MyD88 and TIRAP (Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein) have been shown to mediate signal transduction via TLR2 and TLR4 (29Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 30Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel adapter protein, termed TRIF (Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β), may mediate signaling via TLR3 but not TLR2 (31Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). To assess the role of MyD88 in TLR-induced STAT1 serine phosphorylation, peritoneal macrophages were obtained from wild-type (C57BL/6) and MyD88–/– mice. Cells were stimulated with E. coli LPS or Pam3Cys for various times as indicated. As shown in Fig. 10, both LPS and Pam3Cys induced rapid serine phosphorylation of STAT1 in wild-type macrophages. In MyD88-deficient macrophages, however, LPS also induced rapid STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation, whereas Pam3Cys did not. This demonstrates that activation of STAT1 serine phosphorylation via TLR2 is MyD88-dependent. Additional signaling components, such as TRIF, might provide an alternate pathway leading to STAT1 serine phosphorylation via TLR4. Together, these findings suggest a model in which STAT1 serine phosphorylation arises from two distinct signaling pathways. One pathway is TLR-specific and leads to the activation of a protein serine kinase, and the other pathway (via either MyD88 or TRIF) leads to the activation of p38 (Fig. 11). Neither pathway alone is sufficient to induce STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation.Fig. 11TLR-specific and p38-dependent activation of STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation. Shown is a model of signal transduction leading to STAT1 serine phosphorylation indicating the putative requirement of the p38 MAP kinase, PKC-δ, and a novel TLR2-specific pathway that leads to the activation of a non-PKC STAT1 serine protein kinase. Our data also support the possibility that either MyD88 or TIRAP can mediate TLR-specific activation of p38.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The objective of these studies was to characterize a novel signal transduction pathway initiated by engagement of TLR proteins. Many previous reports (6Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 7Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Carothers J. Xiao C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2059-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) have documented the activation of MAP kinases and the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 by various members of the TLR family. Studies using genetically modified mice have demonstrated that activation of these signaling pathways is dependent on a variety of adapter proteins, such as MyD88, TIRAP, and TRIF. MyD88 and TI-RAP together appear to mediate signaling via TLR2 and TLR4 (29Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 30Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), whereas TRIF participates in signaling via TLR3 (31Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). In the case of TLR4 signaling, additional adapter proteins may provide an alternate signaling pathway that can activate MAP kinases in a MyD88-independent manner (32Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). We reported previously (20Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.-Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R.G. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) that TLR4-dependent signaling could activate cellular responses that are not activated by engagement of TLR2 and were not dependent on MyD88. Specifically, these responses include the induction of IFN-β gene expression, activation of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and the induction of several STAT1-dependent genes (e.g. inducible nitric oxide synthase, IP-10, MCP-5). The current studies sought to characterize an additional response induced by TLR engagement, namely STAT1 serine phosphorylation, and to identify the factors necessary for this phosphorylation. These studies revealed that STAT1 serine phosphorylation was rapidly induced following engagement of TLR2 and TLR4, as well as TLR9 (data not shown). These responses were dependent on TLR signaling as shown by the unresponsiveness of macrophages from TLR2–/– or TLR4 mutant (C3H/HeJ) mice to the TLR agonists Pam3Cys and E. coli LPS, respectively. In contrast to STAT1 serine phosphorylation, STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced more slowly by E. coli LPS and not at all by Pam3Cys. In the case of LPS-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, this response was shown previously (20Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.-Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R.G. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) to be downstream of TLR4-induced IFN-β production, IF-NAR engagement, and Jak/Tyk kinase activation. The inability of Pam3Cys to induce STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was because of the inability of this TLR2 agonist to induce IFN-β production. Although a role for PI3K in STAT1 serine phosphorylation induced by E. coli LPS or Pam3Cys could not be demonstrated, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by E. coli LPS. Additional experiments revealed that PI3K was not necessary for LPS-induced IFN-β expression or for IFNAR signaling in response to exogenous IFN-β. Therefore, these data support the possibility that PI3K mediates IFN-β secretion by LPS-activated macrophages, a possibility suggested previously by Ohmori and Hamilton (25Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 598-604PubMed Google Scholar). Two published studies (27Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) have reported that LPS-induced STAT1 serine phosphorylation was dependent on the p38 MAP kinase. These studies were confirmed and extended by showing that the p38 inhibitor SB203580 could also block Pam3Cys-induced STAT1 serine phosphorylation. Together with the finding that p38 activation by exogenous IL-1β protein could not activate STAT1 serine phosphorylation in macrophages, our findings demonstrate that p38 is necessary, but not sufficient, for TLR-induced STAT1 activation. Because the type I IL-1 receptor signals via MyD88 (33Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 34Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), our data also suggest that MyD88 signaling is not sufficient for activation of STAT1 serine phosphorylation and that this response is mediated via a novel TLR-associated signaling pathway. The role of MyD88 in TLR-induced STAT1 serine phosphorylation was assessed directly using macrophages from MyD88–/– mice. These studies revealed that MyD88 was necessary for TLR2-dependent activation of STAT1 but not for TLR4-dependent STAT1 activation. One likely explanation for this difference comes from the potential for the TLR4-specific adapter protein TRIF to activate p38, a kinase that is necessary for STAT1 serine phosphorylation. TRIF may activate MAP kinases in a MyD88-independent manner (16Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar), thus providing a means to activate p38 in LPS-stimulated MyD88–/– macrophages. Because TRIF does not mediate TLR2 activation by Pam3Cys, the TLR2 signaling pathway is solely dependent on MyD88 for activation of p38. This possibility is consistent with our finding that Pam3Cys failed to activate STAT1 serine phosphorylation in the MyD88–/– macrophages. Although the existence of a MyD88-independent pathway leading to MAP kinase activation via TLR4 has been demonstrated previously, the specific adapter protein that mediates this pathway has not been identified definitively. Whether this adapter protein is TRIF or another novel factor remains to be determined. Our studies also attempted to shed light on the identity of the STAT1 serine kinase activated by TLR engagement in macrophages. A previous report (28Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) has shown that p38 kinase itself only weakly phosphorylates STAT1 in vitro. More recently, additional kinases, including PKC-δ, PI3K, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (24Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Nair J.S. DaFonseca C.J. Tjernberg A. Sun W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chait B.T. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14408-14416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), have been shown to directly or indirectly mediate STAT1 serine phosphorylation in response to IFN signaling. Two pharmacological inhibitors of PKC were used to demonstrate a role for PKC isoforms in STAT1 serine phosphorylation induced via TLR4. Furthermore, the finding that rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKC-δ, could block LPS-induced STAT1 serine phosphorylation suggests a role for this particular PKC isoform. Consistent with this conclusion is the finding that a dominant-negative PKC-δ mutant partially blocking activation of a STAT1-dependent promoter by LPS. Unexpectedly, STAT1 serine phosphorylation in macrophages activated using Pam3Cys was not blocked by either rottlerin or by the pan-PKC inhibitor bisindoylmaleamide. Thus, PKC isoforms do not appear to play a role in STAT1 serine phosphorylation induced via TLR2. The identity of this additional serine kinase, and a reason for the existence of two distinct p38-dependent pathways leading to STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation, remain to be determined. In summary, these findings demonstrate that distinct signal transduction pathways regulate TLR-dependent STAT1 serine and tyrosine phosphorylation in macrophages. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies performed using fibroblasts (13Zhu X. Wen Z. Xu L.Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is indirectly mediated by the production of endogenous type I IFN, particularly IFN-β, in LPS-stimulated macrophages (20Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.-Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R.G. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). We have extended these earlier studies by showing that PI3K activation is necessary for STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Because PI3K does not appear to be necessary for the induction of IFN-β gene expression, or signaling via the IFNAR, PI3K is likely to mediate the translation of IFN-β mRNA and/or the secretion of newly synthesized IFN-β protein. In contrast, STAT1 serine phosphorylation was clearly independent of PI3K in macrophages. Moreover, TLR-induced STAT1 serine phosphorylation was found to be dependent on both p38 and an additional STAT1 serine kinase, as discussed above. Thus, the mechanisms that regulate the DNA binding and trans-activation functions of STAT1 in macrophages, via phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine residues, respectively, are highly complex and differ somewhat from similar mechanisms that have been described previously in fibroblasts. The delineation of macrophage-specific mechanisms that regulate STAT1 serine phosphorylation will be the subject of future studies. We thank Dr. Myriam Armant, Dr. Kurt Heldwein, and Sara Heiny for assistance with breeding and genotyping of the TLR2–/– and MyD88–/– mice, as well as the isolation of murine peritoneal macrophages."

The glycan epitopes on the parasite are suggested to be involved in the Leishmania pathogenesis. One of such established species-unique glycan structures is the poly-β-galactosyl epitope (Galβ1–3)n found on L. major, which can develop cutaneous infections with strong inflammatory responses. Interestingly, the polygalactosyl epitope is also suggested to be involved in the development of the parasites in its host vector, sand fly. Thus, the recognition of the galactosyl epitope by lectins expressed in host or sand fly should be implicated in the species-specific manifestations of leishmaniasis and in the parasite life cycle, respectively. We recently reported that one host β-galactoside-binding protein, galectin-3, can distinguish L. major from the other species through its binding to the poly-β-galactosyl epitope, proposing a role for galectin-3 as an immunomodulator that could influence the L. major-specific immune responses in leishmaniasis. Here we report that galectin-9 can also recognize L. major by binding to the L. major-specific polygalactosyl epitope. Frontal affinity analysis with different lengths of poly-β-galactosyllactose revealed that the galectin-9 affinity for polygalactose was enhanced in proportion to the number of Galβ1–3 units present. Even though both galectins have comparable affinities toward the polygalactosyl epitopes, only galectin-9 can promote the interaction between L. major and macrophages, suggesting distinctive roles for the galectins in the L. major-specific development of leishmaniasis in the host.

Innate immunity plays a critical role in the protection against pathogen invasion. The recognition of invading pathogens initiates different innate immune responses, including elimination of pathogens, antigen presentation to initiate acquired immunity, and elicitation of signaling cascades, which regulate local/systemic immune responses (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Some of the C-type (calcium-dependent) lectins have been demonstrated to play critical roles as pathogen recognition molecules (2Gordon S. Cell. 2002; 111: 927-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). For example, soluble collectins bind to pathogens resulting in their efficient removal (3Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Another example is the membrane-associated dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). DC-SIGN binds to “self ” glycans as well as pathogen-associated glycans on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which results in the suppression of dendritic cell functions (4Geijtenbeek T.B.

Thus, pathogen recognition by a lectin could induce distinct immune responses.In contrast to those C-type lectins, S-type lectins, more recently termed galectins (9Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N. Cummings R.D. Drickamer K. Feizi T. Gitt M.A. Hirabayashi J. Hughes C. Kasai K. Cell. 1994; 76: 597-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), have been considered as lectins that bind to self glycans because galectins bind preferentially to polylactosamine chains attached to the host cell glycoproteins/lipids (11Sato S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a number of pathogenic entities express glycoconjugates containing β-galactosides, either similar to those of the host cells or unique to pathogens, such as the polygalactosyl epitope on protozoa Leishmania major (13Turco S.J.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, questions such as whether some galectins can play roles as “nonself ” or pathogen-recognizing molecules have recently emerged. Indeed we and others (15Mey A. Leffler H. Hmama Z. Normier G.

The arrangement of the CRD(s) within the molecule is unique for each galectin, which are consequently classified into three types: prototype, tandem-repeat, and chimera type (18Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Prototype galectins contain one CRD and exist as a monomer (such as galectin-7) or dimer (such as galectin-1, -2), whereas tandem-repeat galectins, such as galectin-8 and -9, contain two CRDs connected by a short linker region. Galectin-3 is chimeric type galectin, composed of one CRD and a non-CRD domain, which regulates the multivalence status of galectin-3. Galectins have different affinities for the substituted lactosamine residues (11Sato S. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6983-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sparrow C.P.

Hence, it is possible that some glycoconjugates, including nonself pathogenic glycans, could be recognized by various galectins, whereas others could be relatively specific to a particular galectin (23Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). It has also been speculated that the differences in the galectin CRD arrangements influence the cross-linking mode of the galectin ligand and contribute to their functions (24Rabinovich G.A.

We recently found that galectin-3 binds to L. major through L. major-specific poly-β-galactosyl epitope (Galβ1–3)n (16Pelletier I. Sato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17663-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 binds to L. major but not to the other species, L. donovani or L. mexicana, which do not express the polygalactosyl epitope (16Pelletier I. Sato S. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that the species-specific manifestations of Leishmania in human, ranging from fatal visceral infections to mild cutaneous lesions, are accounted for in part by the species-specific glycoconjugates (see Fig. 1) (36Berman J.D.

Interestingly, the L. major-specific polygalactosyl epitope is implicated in two stages of the Leishmania life cycle: the host-pathogen interactions (39Handman E. Goding J.W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 40Kelleher M. Bacic A. Handman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the attachment of Leishmania to its sand fly vector (41Butcher B.A. Turco S.J. Hilty B.A. Pimenta P.F. Panunzio M. Sacks D.L. J. Biol.

Science. 1992; 256: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It is likely that such roles of the polygalactosyl epitopes are mediated by β-galactoside-binding proteins such as galectins. However, galectin-3 is hitherto the only lectin that has been shown to have an affinity for this unique epitope (16Pelletier I. Sato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17663-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Various galectins are expressed in dermal tissues (initial site of the Leishmania infection) which is composed of phagocytic cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells as well as emigrated lymphocytes. Thus, it is possible that other galectins recognize L. major. Because each galectin possesses a unique structure, binding of different galectins to the species-specific ligands could affect the different manifestations of the infections, especially the initial immune responses. However, it remains to be determined whether other galectins have any affinities to the L. major-specific glycan epitopes and whether interactions between the parasites and different galectins influence the development of immune responses in a manner different from that of galectin-3.Here we show that galectin-9 can bind to L. major in a species-specific manner through L. major-specific poly-β-galactose (Galβ1–3)1∼4. Even though that both galectin-3 and -9 recognize L. major, only galectin-9 promotes L. major-macrophage interaction. Thus the data suggest the distinctive roles of galectin-9 in the L. major-specific pathogenesis of leishmaniasis.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Chemicals and other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Antibodies against galectin-1, -3, and -9 were raised in our laboratories by injecting recombinant galectins to rabbits (16Pelletier I. Sato S. J. Biol.

L. major mutant Spock, which lacks the activity of β1,3-galactosyltransferase, and its wild type Friedlin V1 (generously provided by Dr. D. Sacks (NIAID)) were grown in medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 20 mm HEPES, 100 μm adenine, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (41Butcher B.A. Turco S.J.

Leishmania at stationary phase were used for experiments.For some experiments, the promastigote population was separated into procyclic- and metacyclic-rich fractions using Ficoll gradients as published by Spath and Beverley (44Spath G.F. Beverley S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 2001; 99: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, stationary phase cultures of Leishmania (∼109 parasites) were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in 3 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). The cell suspensions were then loaded onto a Ficoll gradient composed, from the bottom, of 2 ml of 20%, 2 ml of 15%, 2 ml of 10%, and 2 ml of 5% Ficoll diluted in 4× serum-free medium 199. The gradient was next centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The metacyclic promastigotes were recovered on the top of the 10% Ficoll layer, and the procyclic ones were recovered in the 15% Ficoll layer. The parasites in those fractions were washed twice with RPMI 1640 complemented with 25 mm HEPES and used immediately for the experiments.Purification of Galectins, Preparation of Galectin Affinity Columns and Alexa 488-labeled Galectins—Recombinant human galectins were purified as described previously (16Pelletier I.

After washing and deactivating excess active groups by ethanolamine, the galectin-immobilized agarose beads were removed from the cartridge. Each gel matrix was suspended in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and the slurry was packed into a stainless steel column (4.0 × 10 mm; bed column, 0.126 ml, GL Sciences, Inc.).Alexa 488-labeled galectins were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes) with a slight modification. Briefly, recombinant galectin in PBS containing 5 mm lactose and 20 mm HEPES was first transferred into the manufacturer-supplied bottle containing Alexa 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester, dilithium salt (Molecular Probes), and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After terminating the labeling reaction by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (final concentration 20 mm), the reaction mixture was first applied to a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove lactose and excess dye, and the void fraction was collected to obtain Alexa 488-labeled galectin. Alexa 488-labeled galectin was purified further by asialofetuin-agarose as published before (32Sato S. Ouellet N. Pelletier I. Simard M. Rancourt A. Bergeron M.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).Galectin Binding to L. major Parasites—Leishmania parasites (1 × 107) were incubated with recombinant galectin (1 ∼ 2 μm) in 250 μl of buffer consisting of 125 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm HEPES and 125 μl of PBS in the presence or absence of 100 mm lactose at 4 °C for 30 min as described previously (16Pelletier I. Sato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17663-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When the binding assays were performed in the presence of lactose, the sodium chloride concentration in the PBS was adjusted to maintain appropriate osmolarity, i.e. 317 mosmol/liter. After the incubation, parasite-free supernatants were obtained by spinning at 4,500 × g for 7 min. The supernatants were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins in the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Alternatively, fractionated proteins on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to the nitrocellulose filters, and galectin was detected by the appropriate antibody against galectin.For flow cytometric analysis, Leishmania were incubated as above with Alexa 488-labeled galectin for 15 min at 4 °C. Unbound galectin was removed by a brief wash with ice-cold PBS twice, and Leishmania were fixed in 2% formaldehyde containing PBS for 10 min at 4 °C and analyzed for the relative fluorescent intensity on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as described previously (32Sato S.

Briefly, 4 volumes of chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, v/v) were added to the wallaby milk. After being thoroughly mixed and separated by centrifugation at 4 °C and 3,500 × g for 30 min, the methanol/water upper fraction containing oligosaccharides was obtained, and solvents were removed by evaporation followed by freeze-drying. The oligosaccharides (∼100 mg) were fractionated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (100 × 2.5 cm, Amersham Biosciences), and polygalactosyllactose derivatives were purified further by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-4 (100 × 2.5 cm, Bio-Rad), as published before. The purified oligosaccharides were labeled with PA following the manufacturer's instructions (Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan). The purity of PA-labeled oligosaccharides was confirmed as described previously (51Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3068-3077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Frontal Affinity Chromatography (FAC) Analysis—FAC analysis was carried out as described previously (51Arata Y.

Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Briefly, PA-oligosaccharide was dissolved in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and applied to the column through a 2-ml sample loop connected to the Rheodyne 7725 injector. The sample loop and the column were immersed in a 20 °C water bath. The flow rate was controlled by a Shimadzu LC-10Advp pump at 0.25 ml/min. Elution of PA-oligosaccharide from the column was monitored by a Shimadzu PR10AxL fluorescence detector at 400 nm (excitation at 320 nm). The elution volume of PA-oligosaccharide of interest (Vf) was determined as described previously. The elution volume of PA-oligosaccharide, which has no affinity to galectins (V0), was determined by using PA-rhamnose.The total amount of immobilized galectin in the column, Bt is first determined by using PA-lacto-N-fucopentaose I (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcOPA) using the equation described previously, [A]0·(Vf−V0)=BtKd·(Vf−V0)(Eq. 1) where Kd is the dissociation constant between interacting biomolecules, Bt is the total amount of immobilized ligand, [A]0 is the initial concentration of the PA-oligosaccharide of interest (A), Vf is the elution volume of A, and V0 is the elution volume of PA-rhamnose, which has no affinity toward galectins. As in the assays employed in this study, [A]0, the initial concentration of the PA-oligosaccharides, was 10 nm, which was negligibly small compared with Kd. Thus, Vf approached the maximum value, Vf, which is independent of [A]0, and we used the following equation to obtain the values of Kd of each galectin toward a polygalactosyllactose derivative. Vf-V0=Bt/Kd(Eq. 2) Infection of Macrophages with L. major Parasites—Stationary phase L. major promastigotes at a cell concentration of 107 cells/ml were labeled with cell tracker green (4.65 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's instruction. J774A.1 macrophages (2 × 105 cells) were incubated in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 and 25 mm HEPES with the labeled parasites (5 × 106 cells) in the absence or presence (1.6 μm) of galectins and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Following the incubation, parasites that were not associated with macrophages were removed by washing three times with RPMI 1640 and 25 mm HEPES, and cells were then lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Fluorescenceassociated macrophages, which corresponds to the number of L. major bound to or internalized by macrophages, were measured using a fluorometric plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems).RESULTSAnalysis of the Binding Properties of Galectin-1 and -3 toward Polygalactosyllactose Derivatives by FAC—We have recently developed an assay system to assess the binding affinity of various galectins for oligosaccharides by employing FAC analysis with fluorescence-tagged oligosaccharides (53Hirabayashi J. Hashidate T. Arata Y. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. Urashima T. Oka T. Futai M. Muller W. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Thus, we next established a system to search for lectins that can bind to and distinguish L. major from other Leishmania species through recognition of the poly-β-galactosyl epitope. To achieve this goal, galectin-1, which is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, and galectin-3 were first used to assess the affinities for the epitope. For the FAC analysis, we used purified poly-β-galactosyllactose instead of L. major-derived lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) because the LPGs prepared from L. major are a mixture of various lengths of the polygalactosyl epitope (Galβ1–3)n, ranging from one to three repeats (54McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ferguson M.A. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (R in Fig. 1). Various lengths of poly-β-galactosyllactose derivatives (Galβ1–3)nGalβ1–4Glc, were purified from the milk of the tammar wallaby (48Messer M. Trifonoff E. Stern W. Collins J.G. Bradbury J.H.

Res. 1981; 92: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and those derivatives were labeled with PA residues. One of the PA-polygalactosyllactose derivatives dissolved in PBS-EDTA at a concentration of 10 nm was applied continuously to a column containing either galectin-1 or -3 agarose. Elution profiles of PA-labeled sugars from galectin-1 and -3 are shown collectively in Fig. 2. As control, PA-rhamnose, which does not show any affinity for galectins, was also applied to the column.Fig. 2Elution profiles of various PA-labeled poly-β-galactosyllactose derivatives after application to immobilized galectin-1 and -3 columns. PA-labeled poly-β-galactosyllactose derivatives were dissolved in EDTA-PBS at a concentration of 10 nm, and 2 ml of each solution was applied to the column (10 × 4.0 mm, 0.126 ml) through a 2-ml loop (inner diameter, 0.75 mm) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at 20 °C. Each elution pattern of PA-labeled oligosaccharide was superimposed on that of PA-rhamnose so that the retardation could be seen. The structures of PA-oligosaccharide are shown above the elution patterns. To obtain the Kd and Bt values, the total amount of immobilized galectin in the column was calculated by analyzing the concentration dependence of retardation of PA-lacto-N-fucopentaose I (Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcOPA) with Equation 1, as described previously (77Arata A. Sekiguchi M. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The Bt values of galectin-1 and -3 were 2.3 and 0.14 nmol, respe"
https://openalex.org/W1964699435,"We have proposed that faulty processing of arrested replication forks leads to increases in recombination and chromosome instability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and contributes to the shortened lifespan of dna2 mutants. Now we use the ribosomal DNA locus, which is a good model for all stages of DNA replication, to test this hypothesis. We show directly that DNA replication pausing at the ribosomal DNA replication fork barrier (RFB) is accompanied by the occurrence of double-strand breaks near the RFB. Both pausing and breakage are elevated in the early aging, hypomorphic dna2-2 helicase mutant. Deletion of FOB1, encoding the fork barrier protein, suppresses the elevated pausing and DSB formation, and represses initiation at rDNA ARSs. The dna2-2 mutation is synthetically lethal with Δrrm3, encoding another DNA helicase involved in rDNA replication. It does not appear to be the case that the rDNA is the only determinant of genome stability during the yeast lifespan however since strains carrying deletion of all chromosomal rDNA but with all rDNA supplied on a plasmid, have decreased rather than increased lifespan. We conclude that the replication-associated defects that we can measure in the rDNA are symbolic of similar events occurring either stochastically throughout the genome or at other regions where replication forks move slowly or stall, such as telomeres, centromeres, or replication slow zones.

Replication fork stress has been implicated as a major cause of genome instability in bacteria and yeast. In Escherichia coli, replication forks initiated at the origins frequently stall because of mutations in replication proteins, template blocks, or pauses at natural replication terminator sites. A common intermediate in restoring replication forks after stalling is a double-strand break (DSB), 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; RFB, replication fork barrier; pol, polymerase; NTS, nontranscribed spacer; RI, replication intermediates; HJI, Holliday junction intermediate; nt, nucleotide; TBE, Tris borate/EDTA. 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; RFB, replication fork barrier; pol, polymerase; NTS, nontranscribed spacer; RI, replication intermediates; HJI, Holliday junction intermediate; nt, nucleotide; TBE, Tris borate/EDTA. which is thought to lead to recombination, producing genomic instability.Evidence that replication forks pause in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also convincing (1Sogo J.M.

In the absence of checkpoint function, the stalled forks are converted to regressed forks, a Holliday-like structure arising by branch migration and reannealing of nascent DNA strands (3Postow L.

Primase mutants also show high levels of stalled and regressed forks (1Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). There is also a naturally occurring replication fork barrier (RFB) within the rDNA (ribosomal DNA) repeats, and the structure of forks paused at the RFB has been characterized (4Linskens M.H.K.

Finally, recent evidence suggests that the yeast ATR homolog, Mec1, protects replication forks from collapsing and giving rise to DSBs in replication slow zones throughout the chromosome (7Cha R.S. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 297: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Evidence is also accumulating that replication fork failure leads to recombinogenic structures that result in gross chromosomal rearrangements (7Cha R.S. Kleckner N.

Given the lagging strand role, dna2 mutants might be expected to lead to recombinogenic intermediates resembling those that are found in primase mutants (1Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). We previously provided evidence of elevated rDNA recombination in dna2 mutants, as measured by loss of an ADE2 marker from the rDNA array in the mutant, and we showed that Dna2p associates with rDNA maximally during S phase (11Hoopes L. Budd M. Choe W. Weitao T. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4136-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Choe W. Budd M. Imamura O. Hoopes L. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2002-2017Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This evidence for replication-related recombination did not show directly, however, that dna2 increased replication fork pausing, nor did it demonstrate the occurrence of lesions in the rDNA.Now, we show that replication pausing and Holliday junction formation are accompanied by DSB formation at near the naturally occurring replication fork block in the rDNA and that all of these events are increased in a dna2-2 mutant. We present the rDNA only as a model for other regions of the chromosome that we propose are undergoing similar replication fork failure, since we show that altering the physical structure of the rDNA by encoding rRNA only on plasmids, under either an RNA pol I or an RNA pol II promoter, shortens, rather than extends, the lifespan of yeast.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Cell Growth—Strains used in this study are W303, MATa trp1 his3 ade2 ura3; dna2-2, MATa trp1 his3 ade2 ura3 dna2-2 (::LEU2); fob1Δ, MATa trp1 his3 ade2 ura3 fob1(::HIS3); dna2-2 fob1Δ, MATa trp1 his3 ade2 ura3 dna2-2 (::LEU2) fob1(::HIS3). The dna2-2 strain was generated by backcross of the original dna2-2 mutant (21Formosa T. Nitiss T. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to W303 five times. Isogenic fob1Δ strains were constructed as described previously using plasmid YEpFOB1::HIS3 kindly provided by T. Kobayashi (National Institute of Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan) (27Kobayashi T.

Genomic DNA was prepared as described by Huberman et al. (32Huberman J.A. Spotila L.D. Nawotka K.A. El-Assouli S.M. Davis L.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 473-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) except that DNA was extracted with phenol/choloroform/isopropyl alcohol instead of being purified with CsCl gradients. The purified DNA was digested with BglII, and BND-cellulose (benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE cellulose, Sigma) was used to enrich branched DNA molecules (32Huberman J.A. Spotila L.D. Nawotka K.A.

The procedure for Neutral/Neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis described by Brewer and Fangman (33Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. The first dimension gel (0.5% agarose in TBE) was run at 1 V/cm at 4 °C for 36 h. The second gel (0.9% in TBE containing 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide) was run at 4 V/cm at 4 °C in circulating TBE containing 0.3 μg/ml of ethidium bromide for 9–12 h.DSB Analysis—Isolation of intact yeast DNA was basically performed as described previously with modifications (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 655-677Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 107) were suspended in 50 μl of cold L buffer (0.1 m EDTA, pH 8, 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.6, and 0.02 m NaCl) in an Eppendorf tube containing 5 μl of cold zymolyase (Zymolyase-20T, Arthrobacter luteus, 20,000U/gm; ICN) at a stock concentration of 20 mg/ml. The cell suspension was warmed by incubating the tube in a 42 °C water bath for a few seconds and mixed briefly with 50 μl of 1% low melting agarose prepared in L buffer and cooled down to 42 °C. The mixture was placed in an ice water bath. The gel plug was transferred into a 20-ml round-bottomed glass tube containing 5 ml of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8 and 0.01 m Tris, pH 7.6 plus 1% β-mercaptoethanol (the gel plug could be easily flushed out into the glass tube with the buffer). The gel plug was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The buffer was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of the same buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml zymolyase. The gel plug was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The buffer was removed and replaced with 1 ml of L buffer containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K and 2.5% Sarkosyl. The gel plug was incubated at 50 °C for 24 h. After the gel plug was cooled on ice, the buffer was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of the same buffer containing proteinase K and Sarkosyl. The incubation was repeated at 50 °C for 24 h. The gel plug was incubated in 5 ml of Tris-EDTA (TE) (pH 7.6) containing 40 μg/ml phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride at 50 °C. After1hof incubation, the gel plug was incubated in 5 ml of TE at 50 °C for another hour. The plug was further incubated with 100 μg/ml RNase A at 50 °C for 3 h in restriction enzyme buffer (1 ml). Buffer was removed, and the plug incubated in 0.5 ml of restriction enzyme buffer containing BglII (100 units) at 37 °C overnight. The gel plug was soaked in 5 ml of TE at 4 °C for 0.5 h. After the buffer was drained, 20 μl of 6× loading buffer (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 655-677Google Scholar) was added to the gel plug. After incubation on ice for 0.5 h, the gel plug was loaded into the well of a 1% agarose gel, which was run in TBE at 1.5–2 V/cm at 4 °C for 24 h. The gel was stained in 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 2–4 h and inspected under UV and used for Southern blot.Probes and Labeling—Probe DNA was prepared by PCR from a rDNA plasmid with the following pairs of primers: probe A, ER5A-up, 5′-GCC ATT TAC AAA AAC ATA ACG-3′ and ER5A-lower, 5′-GGG CCT AGT TTA GAG AGA AGT-3′; probe B, X35S-up, 5′-ATA TCA ACC CTG ACG GTA GAG-3′ and X35S-lower, 5′-CAT GGT ATA ACT GTG GTA ATT CTA GAG-3′; probe C, BglII end-up, 5′-ACA GAT GTG CCG CCC CAG CCA AAC TCC-3′ and BglII end-lower, 5′-CCT GGA TAT GGA TTC TTC ACG GTA ACG-3′. The PCR products were gel-purified. Random-primed labeling kit (Roche Applied Science GmbH) was used to label the probe DNA in the presence of four [α-32P]dNTPs.Southern Hybridization—DNA in the gel was vacuum-transferred onto a gene screen plus hybridization transfer membrane (positive charged, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 0.1 n NaOH. After transfer, the membrane was washed in 0.5× SSC and 0.5% SDS twice and vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 20 min. The membrane was prehybridized in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml boil-denatured calf thymus DNA, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 65 °C. It was hybridized in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt, and 0.5% SDS containing heat-denatured labeled probe at 65 °C in a water bath for 1 h or overnight. When the temperature of the water bath went down to 30 °C, the membrane was washed briefly with 0.5× SSC and 0.5% SDS twice, further with 1–2 liters of prewarmed (30 °C) 0.5× SSC 0.5% SDS at 30 °C for 2–4 h. After washing briefly with 0.5× SSC at room temperature to remove SDS, the membrane was air semi-dried on tissue (complete drying was avoided) and then put in a phosphorimaging screen cassette plus an x-ray film. Exposure was at 4 °C for 1–3 weeks.Gel Image Analysis—Phosphorimager files of two-dimensional gels were translated into Photoshop files (Adobe Photoshop Elements) for image processing and quantification. Image quantification was performed using NIH Image 1.62 and plotted with CA-Cricket Graph III 1.52. Briefly, images of a Photoshop file was pasted to a blank window of NIH Image Analysis. The same tool was used to select the image object for measurement of area, integrated density, and background. The numerical data were pasted onto a blank work sheet of Cricket Graph. Calculations are conducted as follows: Unit signal of individual object, USIO = (integrated density – background)/area. Individual objects include 1 N spot (US 1N), RFB (US RFB), fork convergence or double-Y (US Y), and Holliday junction (US HJ, see Fig. 1D). The ratios for comparison include US RFB/US 1N, US Y/US 1N, and US HJ/US 1N. All three ratios were set to 1 for the wild type with which the mutants were compared.RESULTSTwo-dimensional Gel Analysis of rDNA Replication and Recombination Intermediates—We have chosen to study rDNA replication in yeast, both because instability of the rDNA locus is correlated with short lifespan in yeast and because the rDNA repeats contain a naturally occurring RFB, similar in some respects to the bacterial termination system (see Ref. 34Rothstein R. Michel B. Gangloff S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar for review). In yeast, the rDNA occurs as about 150 tandem repeats of a 9.1-kb sequence on chromosome XII. The rDNA is organized into a nucleolar structure where rRNA is synthesized, processed, and ribosome assembly is begun. Each rDNA repeat contains two transcribed regions (35 S and 5 S rRNA) and two nontranscribed spacers (NTS1 and NTS2). NTS1 houses the polar RFB (130 bp), an enhancer for RNA polymerase I (pol I), and a cis-acting mitotic recombination hot spot (HOT1); while NTS2 contains a promoter for 35 S rRNA recognized by pol I and an origin of replication, ARS (4Linskens M.H.K. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4927-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 5Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L.

Hadjiolov A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2955-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).When replication initiates from the ARS in NTS2, the movement of replication forks in the same direction as 5 S rRNA transcription is blocked at the RFB in NTS1, whereas the forks progressing in the direction of 35 S rRNA transcription are allowed to pass through the RFB (4Linskens M.H.K. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4927-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 5Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1988; 55: 637-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Thus, the RFB imposes polar replication arrest in rDNA units containing an active ARS (Fig. 1) (37Brewer B.J. Lockshon D. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Characterization of forks arrested at the RFB shows that after the replication fork arrives, the Okazaki fragments on the stalled lagging strand are completely processed (6Gruber M. Wellinger R.E. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5777-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Muller M. Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The nascent lagging strand arrests three bases ahead of the leading strand (6Gruber M. Wellinger R.E. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5777-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).To study replication pausing and recombination at the rDNA RFB, we used N/N (neutral-neutral) two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (two-dimensional gel) (33Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 37Brewer B.J. Lockshon D. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with modifications (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Genomic DNA was digested with BglII, which generates two fragments in the rDNA, a 4.6-kb fragment containing the RFB in the center and the ARS near the right end (Fragment BglII-A in Fig. 1A), and a second fragment containing most of the 35 S RNA coding region (BglII-B in Fig. 1A). The digest was fractionated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in which the first dimension is run under conditions that separate DNA by mass, and the second dimension under conditions that separate according to the shape of replication intermediates (RIs). The gel was then blotted and the RIs visualized by hybridization to various probes (Fig. 1A). Because the ARS from which bi-directional replication initiates is proximal to the right end of BglII-Fragment A, the initiation bubble rapidly reaches the right end and is converted to a fork upon restriction enzyme digestion. RIs arising from Fragment A therefore generate a so-called Y-arc on the gel (big and small Ys in Fig. 1, B and C). In a repeat unit where initiation has occurred at an active ARS, forks moving leftward from the ARS arrest at the RFB greater than 90% of the time, and therefore produce primarily molecules with arms no longer than half of the length of the BglII-A fragment (small Ys in Fig. 1, B and C). When the leftward forks are arrested at the RFB, RIs with a branch point near the RFB accumulate, generating a spot at the apex of the Y-arc as shown in Fig. 1, B and C. The spot intensity reflects the extent of stable replication pausing. Forks entering from the left and moving rightward, by contrast, pass the RFB in repeats lacking an active ARS and generate a composite of small and large Y-forks, forming a complete Y-arc on a two-dimensional gel (Fig. 1, B and C).When a rightward fork is approaching a leftward fork stalled at the RFB, a population of RIs having a double-Y structure is produced, and distributes along a line emanating from the RFB (Fig. 1, B and C). (Double-Y molecules, X-shaped molecules, and broken forms of these species also migrate in the shaded cone-shaped area; Refs. 2Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioloi A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar and 39Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.-H. Courcelle C.T. Science. 2003; : 1081328Google Scholar). When the two forks meet at the RFB, the convergence produces a spot at the end of the line, with a mass of about 2N (9.2 kb), labeled converged forks (Fig. 1C). The intensity of these species is correlated with the extent of pausing at the RFB. Usually, only a small fraction of forks converge, however, because only about 10% of rDNA ARSs fire and are able to generate leftward forks. One can also observe recombination intermediates, X-shaped, or Holliday structures, in the gels. Migration of the Holliday junction generates a composite of X-shaped HJIs, which are distributed along a spike growing up from 2N spot and ending at the same spot as converged forks (Fig. 1, B and C). DNAs in this spike have been shown to be cleaved by RuvC and are therefore considered to represent HJIs rather than forks converging randomly along the rDNA, which would have the same migration pattern (40Zou H. Rothstein R. Cell. 1997; 90: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The intensity of the spike of HJIs is therefore thought to reflect primarily the frequency of the recombination events.Two-dimensional gel analyses of the BglII-A fragment (probes A and C in Fig. 1A) using various mutants are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The RFB is clearly seen in the wild-type strain, both with a probe to the right end of the fragment (probe A in Figs. 1A and 2A) and after re-probing with a fragment hybridizing only to the left end (probe C in Figs. 1A and 2B). The spike to the far left of the cone area in wild type and more prominently in dna2-2 is attributable to multibranched structures (39Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.-H. Courcelle C.T. Science. 2003; : 1081328Google Scholar). Probe B hybridizes to the BglII-B fragment, which contains neither an ARS nor an RFB, and therefore serves as a control. Clearly, there is no specific pausing in this fragment (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with previous findings that the major specific replication fork pause in the rDNA is at the RFB.Fig. 2rDNA replication and recombination in the dna2-2 and fob1Δ mutants. A and B, genomic DNAs from indicated strains were digested with BglII, fractioned by neutral-neutral two-dimensional gels, and analyzed by Southern hybridization using probes A or C described in the legend to Fig. 1A. The gels show rDNA replication and recombination intermediates in the BglII-A fragment (containing the ARS and the RFB as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1). A, probe A; B, same blot, stripped and reprobed with probe C. C, lack of replication fork pausing in the BglII-B fragment that lacks both the ARS and the RFB. The same blots used in A and B were reprobed with probe B, which hybridizes only to the BglII-B fragment (Fig. 1). This experiment controls for the specificity of pausing at the RFB. D, quantification of rDNA replication and recombination intermediates shown in A averaged from three gels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Similar values (not shown) were obtained using data from probe C (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Quantification of Hybridization Signals—In order to quantitatively compare the effects of various mutations on rDNA replication and recombination, we quantified the probe A-hybridization signals due to the RFB, converging forks, and HJIs. Then we normalized individual signals in relation to the intensity of the linear 1N spot (4.6 kb) for each strain (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) (41Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.-Q. Zakian V. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and averaged each value from three experiments using probe A (see Fig. 2D). For ease of comparison, the averaged ratio of each of the signals to 1N was set to one for the wild type. Although we found some variations in the intensity of the 1N spot between experiments due to the loading variations, the ratio of the RFB to 1N signal remained unchanged in all replicate experiments.fob1Δ Reduces Fork Pausing at RFB—Fob1p (fork blocking less, Ref. 42Kobayashi T.

Indeed, each branch of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway has a specific metal ion chelatase that is responsible for ensuring the correct metal ion is inserted (Fig. 1 and Table I) (3Walker C.J. Willows R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Raux E. Schubert H.L. Roper J.M. Wilson S.W. Warren M.J. Bioorgan. Chem. 1999; 27: 100-118Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Table IDifferent types of chelatases involved in modified tetrapyrrole biosynthesisView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Open table in a new tab The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic chelatases fall into three broad classes, which vary markedly in their size and energy requirements (Fig. 1) (5Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The class I chelatases require three subunits for activity and utilize ATP. Examples include the magnesium chelatase in chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll synthesis (3Walker C.J. Willows R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which is constituted by ChlH, I, and D, and the cobaltochelatase found in bacteria that make cobalamin along the cobaltlate pathway and requires CobN, S, and T for chelatase activity (6Debussche L. Couder M. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7445-7451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is obvious sequence similarity between ChlH and CobN, which are thought to be the main tetrapyrrole binding subunits, but much less similarity between ChlI and D and CobS and T. A crystal structure for ChlI has recently been determined, revealing that it belongs to the chaperone-like (AAA) family of ATPases (7Fodje M.N. Hansson A. Hansson M. Olsen J.G. Gough S. Willows R.D. Al-Karadaghi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), with a novel arrangement of domains. However, it is not yet clear how the I and D subunits interact with the H subunit to promote catalysis or why ATP is required. The class II chelatases tend to exist as either monomers or homodimers and do not require ATP for activity (Fig. 1). This group includes the protoporphyrin ferrochelatases (HemH) of heme synthesis (8Al-Karadaghi S. Hansson M. Nikonov S. Jonsson B. Hederstedt L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1501-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the cobaltochelatase associated with the cobalt-early path for cobalamin biosynthesis, CbiK (9Schubert H.L. Raux E. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10660-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The structures of HemH and CbiK have been determined by x-ray crystallography and have revealed a high level of structural similarity, indicating that the proteins have probably arisen by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (9Schubert H.L. Raux E. Wilson K.S. Warren M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10660-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This structural similarity is only reflected in an approximate 10% sequence identity. The third class of chelatase includes CysG and Met8p, which are multifunctional proteins associated with siroheme biosynthesis (Fig. 1) (5Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Warren M.J. Bolt E.L. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Spencer J.B. Woodcock S.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As with the class II chelatases, these proteins are homodimers and do not require ATP for activity. However, they are not structurally similar to HemH or CbiK, and it is likely that they have arisen by the acquisition of a chelatase function within a dehydrogenase catalytic framework (5Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently we have identified other chelatases from Bacillus megaterium that we believe belong to the class II chelatases, which are associated with cobalamin (CbiX) and siroheme (SirB) biosynthesis (Fig. 1) (11Raux E. Lanois A. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Thermes C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CbiX, which contains 306 amino acids, and SirB, which contains 266 amino acids, share about 60% similarity with each other in terms of primary structure. The reason why CbiX is larger than SirB is that it contains a histidine-rich region at its C terminus (12Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a region that may be important for metal delivery and/or storage and which may also contain an Fe-S center (13Leech H.K. Raux-Deery E. Heathcote P. Warren M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 610-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although CbiX and SirB are homologous, that is they are derived from a common ancestor, they only appear to share low sequence similarity with CbiK or HemH (<15%). Thus, the SirB/CbiX family may represent a new division of the class II chelatases. In methanogens the major tetrapyrrole derivatives are coenzyme F430 and cobalamin (14Thauer R. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only some methanogens appear to have heme, there are few reports of siroheme, and they are unable to make bacteriochlorophyll. Indeed, within their genome it is only possible to identify the genes for the biosynthesis of uroporphyrinogen III and its transformation into cobalamin, because the biosynthetic genes for coenzyme F430 are unknown. Among these it is possible to identify a number of chelatase genes, one that encodes a protein with similarity to CbiX and several others with a high level of identity to the cobalt-late cobaltochelatase, CobN. However, because methanogens do not operate the cobalt-late cobalamin biosynthetic pathway (15Raux E. Schubert H.L. Warren M.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1880-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the CobN homologue may in fact represent the nickel chelatase associated with coenzyme F430 (3Walker C.J. Willows R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study, we have cloned the cbiX gene from two methanogens, overproduced CbiX as a recombinant protein, and characterized its inherent enzymatic activity to demonstrate that in methanogens CbiX represents a compact cobalt chelatase. We also highlight how this small CbiX may represent an ancestral chelatase and show that the more complex structures seen in CbiK and HemH may have arisen from this enzyme design. Cloning Procedures—All strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table II. Methanosarcina barkeri (strain Fusaro) and Methanobacter thermoautotrophicum genomic DNA were supplied by Prof. Thauer and Dr. Reiner Hedderich (Max Plank Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, Marburg, Germany). Amplifications were carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 1× PCR buffer (Qiagen), 0.2 mm each of the four deoxynucleotides, 0.02 μg of the appropriate genomic DNA, 0.4 μm of each primer, and one unit of HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen). Conditions for the amplifications were as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, ending with one cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products of the expected size were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted, and cloned into pGEMTeasy (Promega). Subsequently, the M. barkeri cbiX was cloned into pET14b (Novagen) behind a His-tag encoding sequence under the control of a T7 promoter. The M. thermoautotrophicum cbiX has a “natural” His-tag encoding sequence and was thus cloned into pET3a (Novagen), still under the control of a T7 promoter. These pET constructs were used for expression of protein for affinity purification by metal chelate chromatography.Table IIStrains and plasmids used in this studyStrainsPropertiesReference or sourceBL21(DE3)pLysSF- ompT hsdSB(rB- mB-) gal dcm (DE3) pLysSNovagenER171302Δa(pAR8086)[15Raux E.

The pETac plasmid is a modified pET14b in which the T7 promoter has been substituted with a Ptac promoter, allowing the expression in E. coli strain 302Δ a. This is an E. coli cysG mutant that is unable to produce siroheme and, therefore, unable to synthesize cysteine. The cysteine auxotrophy was investigated by growth on minimal media as described previously (16Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Briefly the M. barkeri and M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXs were purified from bacterial lysates using metal chelate affinity chromatography, according to the Novagen pET manual. After application of the crude cell lysates to the metal chelate resin, the column was washed with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) containing 100 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl. The bound CbiX was eluted in buffer containing 400 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl. Protein-containing fractions were detected by a combination of the Bio-Rad protein assay and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing the His-tagged protein were pooled and desalted by passage through a PD-10 column that had previously been equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. The M. barkeri and M. thermoautotrophicum CbiX proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) that had previously been equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. Chelatase Assays—Precorrin-2 and sirohydrochlorin were generated as described previously (5Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) from porphobilinogen using an enzyme mixture containing porphobilinogen deaminase, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase, and for sirohydrochlorin synthesis, precorrin-2 dehydrogenase. CbiX activity was measured with sirohydrochlorin (2.5 μm), Co2+ (20 μm) and between 5 and 50 μg of CbiX in a 1-ml reaction volume in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Assays were performed in duplicate, and initial rates were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8452A photodiode array spectrophotometer at 37 °C. Data Bases and Computer Programs—Sequences, alignments, and comparisons were performed with the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Circular Dichroism Spectra—Purified protein (>95% purity) was dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.9, and concentrated in a Vivaspin 6-ml concentrator (VivaScience). Circular dichroism (CD) 1The abbreviations used are: CD, circular dichroism; CbiXL, long CbiX; CbiXS, short CbiX. spectra were recorded at 25 °C on 0.1 mg/ml samples of protein in a 1-mm quartz cuvette (Hellma) using an Aviv 62DS spectrometer with data acquired between 180–260 nm at 0.5 nm intervals. Deconvolution was carried out using Circular Dichroism Neural Network software (17Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify the type of chelatase used by the Archaea for cobalamin biosynthesis, we searched for the presence of known cobaltochelatases such as CbiK (16Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CbiX (12Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data base searching revealed that homologues of the B. megaterium CbiX were present in the genomes of a range of archaeal members. However, these proteins tended to be less than half the size of the B. megaterium CbiX (Fig. 2), typically containing 110–145 amino acids, which is substantially shorter than the 306 amino acids found in the B. megaterium CbiX. To distinguish between the long versions of CbiX, such as that found in B. megaterium, and the shorter ones found in the Archaea, we termed them CbiXL (long) and CbiXS (short). To investigate the function of the CbiXS proteins we selected the cbiXS gene from two Methanogens, M. barkeri and M. thermoautotrophicum whose CbiXS proteins contain 130 and 143 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 2). The genes were amplified from the appropriate genomic DNA using the primers described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although these two genes clearly encode similar proteins, the M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS also contains a histidine-rich region, similar though quite distinct from the histidine-rich region found in the B. megaterium CbiXL (Fig. 2) (11Raux E. Lanois A. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Thermes C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The M. barkeri cbiXS was cloned into pET14b to allow its recombinant expression as a His-tagged protein, thereby facilitating its purification. Because the M. thermoautotrophicum cbiXS encodes a protein with a naturally occurring histidine-rich region, which is likely to allow purification by metal chelate chromatography, the M. thermoautotrophicum cbiX was cloned into pET3a. The genes were also subcloned into a pETac derivative (pETac-CobA), downstream of the M. thermoautotrophicum cobA. This cloning procedure allows the encoded CbiXS proteins to be tested for their ability to act as ferrochelatases in siroheme biosynthesis through the complementation of a defined E. coli cysG strain (16Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All the amplified genes were fully sequenced to ensure that no PCR errors had been incorporated. Protein Expression—Both the M. barkeri and M. thermoautotrophicumCbiXS proteins were overproduced as soluble recombinant proteins in E. coli and could be clearly seen on SDS-PAGE gels after electrophoresis of whole cell extracts. The M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS with its natural histidine-rich region was purified by metal chelate chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using the same procedures as for the pET14b-engineered M. barkeri CbiXS. This procedure yielded protein that was greater than 90% homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The M. barkeri CbiXS migrated on an SDS gel with a molecular mass of 15 kDa, in close agreement to its gene-predicted molecular mass of 14 kDa plus 2 kDa for the N-terminal His-tag extension. The M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS migrated with a molecular mass of 17 kDa, which is somewhat larger than its gene-predicted molecular mass of 14 kDa. This larger molecular mass may reflect the positioning of the histidine-rich region within the protein, which may give the protein unusual mobility on denaturing gels. The observation that the M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS could be purified on a metal chelate column indicates that the histidine-rich region of the M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS is capable of binding metal. The native aggregation state of the methanogenic CbiXS proteins was investigated using gel-filtration chromatography. This revealed that both CbiXS proteins eluted at a point corresponding to a molecular mass of 40 kDa, suggesting that the proteins exist either as homodimers or homotrimers. CbiXS Activity—Both CbiXS proteins were found to be capable of catalyzing the insertion of cobalt into sirohydrochlorin, yielding cobalt-sirohydrochlorin. A typical reaction profile is shown in Fig. 4a. The reaction can be monitored by the loss of absorption at 376 nm and a relative corresponding gain in absorption at 414 nm (Fig. 4b) (5Schubert H.L. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Leech H.K. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The M. Barkeri CbiXS was found to have a specific activity of 122 nmol of product formed/min/mg of protein, whereas the M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS had a much lower activity of 18 nmol/min/mg. The CbiXS proteins from M. barkeri and M. thermoautotrophicum were not found to chelate cobalt into precorrin-2, suggesting that the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway proceeds via cobalt-sirohydrochlorin. The CbiXS proteins were also tested for their ability to chelate nickel. Only the M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS was found to be able to chelate nickel but with a specific activity substantially lower than that observed for cobalt (6 nmol/min/mg). No activity was observed with M. barkeri CbiXS. Moreover, in competition experiments when the M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS was challenged in an incubation with equal concentrations of cobalt and nickel, cobalt was found to be chelated first. These experiments would suggest that cobalt is the preferred substrate for this chelatase, and it is likely that CbiXS is a cobaltochelatase associated with cobalamin biosynthesis. CbiXS Can Act as a Ferrochelatase in the Biosynthesis of Siroheme in Vivo—Cloning the M. thermoautotrophicum cobA into pETac yielded pETac-cobA. Subsequently, both the cbiXS from M. thermoautotrophicum and the M. barkeri were cloned individually downstream of cobA, to give plasmids pETac-cobA-MBcbiXS and pETac-cobA-MTcbiXS. To ensure that both proteins were being overproduced from this plasmid, the strains harboring these plasmids were probed with antibodies against the His tag. Blots clearly demonstrated immunoreactivity against 30 and 15 kDa proteins, indicating that the CobA and CbiXS proteins were being expressed (data not shown). Moreover, both plasmids (pETac-cobA-MBcbiXS and pETac-cobA-MTcbiXS) were able to complement efficiently the cysG deficiency of the E. coli 302Δ a strain (Table III) (18Griffiths L.A. Cole J.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 147: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the M. thermoautotrophicum CobA is active as a uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase and that both CbiXS proteins are able to function as sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatases. However, the addition of exogenous cobalt to the minimal growth medium onto which the E. coli cysG transformants were plated prevented this complementation (Table III), suggesting that the ferrochelatase activity is inhibited by cobalt. Such an observation would be consistent with CbiXS being a cobalt chelatase. A similar cobalt-dependent inhibition had been observed after the Salmonella enterica cbiK was used to complement this E. coli auxotrophy (16Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Raux E. McVeigh T. Peters S.E. Leustek T. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 701-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When exogenous nickel was added to the minimal growth medium, no metal-dependent inhibition of complementation was observed with the E. coli cysG transformants (Table III). Thus, nickel would not appear to compete competitively with ferrous iron for insertion into sirohydrochlorin with CbiXS.Table IIIComplementation of the E. coli cysG strain 302Δa with a variety of chelatasesPlasmid used to transform the E. coli cysG-deficient strain 302Δ aGrowth on minimal medium supplemented withCysteineNoneCobaltNickelpETac- MTH/cobA+---pkk- Pd/cobA-Pg/cbiK++-+pETac- MTH/cobA-MTH/cbiX++-+pETac-MTH/cobA-MSB/cbiX++-+ Open table in a new tab In vitro experiments with the M. barkeri and M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS proteins revealed that they were able to insert ferrous iron into sirohydrochlorin to yield siroheme. However, this was at a rate of less than 10% of that observed for the chelation of cobalt. Moreover, when equal concentrations of ferrous iron and cobalt were presented to the enzyme in an assay mix, cobalt-sirohydrochlorin was always formed preferentially to siroheme (data not shown). Structural Comparison of CbiXS to Other Chelatases by CD Analysis—No structural information is yet available for any of the SirB/CbiX family of enzymes, so it is not known whether they have any topological similarity to CbiK or HemH or whether they represent a new division of the class II chelatases. To determine whether the CbiXS proteins have any secondary structure similarity to CbiK, CD spectra of the CbiXS, CbiXL, and SirB proteins were recorded and compared with two CbiK proteins. The CD spectra of the two methanogenic CbiXS proteins are highly similar, consistent with the proteins containing a large amount (∼70%) of α-helical secondary structure but still with some β-sheet (8–14%) (Fig. 5). The B. megaterium SirB gave a spectrum consistent with it containing about 60% α-helical secondary structure and 12% β-sheet (Fig. 5). Similarly, the CbiK proteins from S. enterica (16Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (20Roper J.M. Raux E. Brindley A.A. Schubert H.L. Gharbia S.E. Shah H.N. Warren M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40316-40323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) gave spectra equivalent of proteins containing between 40–46% α-helix and 15–19% β-sheet, consistent with the known three-dimensional structure of CbiK (Fig. 5). Thus the SirB/CbiX family of proteins contains a mixed α/β architecture, consistent with that found in CbiK. The secondary structure predictions of the CbiXS and CbiXL suggest that these enzymes adopt an alternating helix-strand-helix topology (21Pollastri G. Przybylski D. Rost B. Baldi P. Proteins. 2002; 47: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In CbiK, the conserved active site histidine His-207 lies on a surface loop between the first β-strand and α-helix of the C-terminal domain. This same structural topology is predicted for the conserved histidine-glycine sequences of B. megaterium CbiXL and the M. barkeri CbiXS. Additional support for the structural alignment with CbiK comes from threading data that align all the CbiX sequences with various members of the class II chelatase structures with a high degree of confidence (22Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). We have overproduced and characterized the CbiXS proteins from M. thermoautotrophicum and M. barkeri. The proteins purified with masses of 17 and 15 kDa, roughly consistent with their gene-predicted sizes. Both proteins were found to act as ferrochelatases in vivo for the biosynthesis of siroheme because they complemented a sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase-deficient E. coli mutant. This functional complementation ability was inhibited in the presence of exogenous cobalt but not nickel. Both proteins were found to catalyze the insertion of cobalt into sirohydrochlorin in vitro with specific activities of 18 and 122 nmol/min/mg, respectively. The difference in activity is probably related to the different growth optima of the two organisms from where the cbiXS genes were obtained. M. barkeri, although initially isolated from an Italian lake, is also found in ruminants and therefore has an optimal temperature-activity dependence around 37 °C, whereas M. thermoautotrophicum grows optimally at around 65 °C. The specific activity of the B. megaterium CbiXL is 318 nmol/min/mg. The M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS was found to be able to chelate nickel into sirohydrochlorin but with a specific activity that was a third lower than that observed for cobalt, whereas the M. barkeri CbiXS had no measurable nickel chelatase at all. On the basis of these experiments we would conclude that the methanogenic CbiXS proteins act as cobaltochelatases during cobalamin biosynthesis. The obvious broad specificity of these CbiXS chelatases in being able to chelate Fe2+, Co2+ and, in the case of the M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS, Ni2+ raises interesting questions about how the correct metal ion is delivered to the chelatase in its host environment. Whether there are specific metal ion chaperones or whether the chelatases interact directly with the metal transporters is not known. The presence of a histidinerich region on the M. thermoautotrophicum CbiXS and the observation that this protein binds to a metal chelate column, suggest that this histidine-rich region may play a role in either metal storage or presentation. Such histidine-rich regions are found in a number of CbiXS and CbiXL proteins, although not all, inferring that different organisms may have evolved alternative methods for metal ion storage and/or delivery. Nonetheless, by identifying CbiXS as the cobalt chelatase in the archaeal organisms, this would suggest that the proteins with similarity to CobN and ChlH, which are also found in these genomes, are likely to be the nickel chelatases associated with coenzyme F430 synthesis. However, it is interesting to note that the CobN and ChlH-like sequences are also found in the genome of Halobacterium, which is a non-methanogenic archaeal member. Moreover, methanogens appear to contain multiple copies of these CobN- and ChlH-like proteins, indicating that there is still much to be learned about the role these proteins play in metabolism. CbiXS Is Structurally Related to CbiXL, SirB, and CbiK— The CD spectra of the CbiXS proteins reveal that they have a mixed α/β structure, with a high α-helix content compared with that observed in the CD spectra of CbiXL, SirB, and CbiK. Nonetheless, all the proteins have a similar β-sheet content; thus the difference in CD spectra between CbiXS and the other larger proteins may be because of a more compact structure with greater order in the loop regions, such that they adopt a helical structure. Moreover, a pileup of CbiXS, CbiXL, and SirB sequences reveals a number of highly conserved residues, including two histidines (at positions 12 and 78 of the M. barkeri CbiXS), an aspartate/histidine (at position 82 of the M. barkeri CbiXS), and a number of prolines, glycines and leucines (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the same ionizable residues are found at the active site of CbiK, where the two histidines are thought to act as general bases in abstracting protons from the substrate and also in binding the metal ion. Indeed, it is possible to force the active site primary structure of CbiK into the CbiX/SirB pileup (Fig. 2). What is clear from this alignment is that the postulated active site histidines are found in the N-terminal region of CbiXL, whereas the equivalent active site histidines are located in the C-terminal region of CbiK. On the basis of the common level of β-sheet in these proteins and the conservation of known catalytic groups, we would predict that CbiXS, CbiXL, SirB, and CbiK belong to the same evolutionary related family of enzymes. Furthermore, because HemH is structurally related to CbiK, it should also be included in this family. Indeed, threading programs all predicted that CbiXS would adopt the fold of the CbiK and HemH. These proteins would all belong to the type II chelatases, and we suggest that the CbiXS proteins be assigned to type IIa, CbiXL and SirB to type IIb, and CbiK and HemH to type IIc (Table I). Evolution of Class II Chelatases—When the B. megaterium CbiXL was blasted against the data bases, it was observed that the CbiXS proteins were being aligned against both the N-terminal (amino acids 1–128) and C-terminal (amino acids 128–260) regions of CbiXL (Fig. 6). This suggests that CbiXL represents the fusion of two CbiXS proteins, a process that may have happened by gene duplication. Indeed, it is possible to split, for example, the B. megaterium CbiXL into two halves and to align them against each other and against a CbiXS sequence. What is observed is that the N-terminal region of CbiXL contains the two important catalytic histidine residues as well as a number of other charged groups, whereas the C-terminal region of CbiXL contains mainly conserved proline and glycine amino acids (Fig. 6), presumably reflecting their importance in maintaining the protein fold. We can therefore envisage that CbiXL evolved from two CbiXS fused together and that the N-terminal domain of the fused protein subsequently maintained the catalytic groups, whereas the C-terminal domain lost these groups because this domain contributed more toward overall protein stability and/or control. Once this prototype CbiXS-dimer fusion appeared, it evolved into CbiXL through the addition of a MXCXXC peptide containing a histidine-rich region, whereas a SirB-type chelatase evolved through selection of a variant capable of accepting Fe and being able to function as a sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase. An extension of this theory can also explain the appearance of CbiK and HemH, because these proteins are composed of two α/β domains that are related to one another by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. These enzymes may also have evolved from a CbiX-dimer fusion. However, in this case, the C-terminal domain maintained the catalytic functional groups, whereas the N-terminal domain lost these residues as it evolved to help maintain the protein function through stability and/or control. This protein then evolved further into a sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase by modification of its metal ion specificity to accept Fe2+, before finally evolving into a protoporphyrin ferrochelatase by changing its tetrapyrrole substrate specificity from sirohydro-chlorin to protoporphyrin. In this respect, the evolution of the CbiK/HemH or CbiXL/SirB can be explained by the generation of a CbiXS-dimer fusion and then maintenance of the essential catalytic groups in either the N- or C-terminal domain of the final protein. Thus, CbiXS may represent the primordial chelatase design from which these other proteins evolved. We thank Prof. R.

Pin1-catalyzed peptidyl-prolyl isomerization provides a key conformational switch to activate phosphorylation sites with the common phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro sequence motif. This motif is ubiquitously exploited in cellular response to a variety of signals. Pin1 is able to bind phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro-containing sequences at two different sites that compete for the same substrate.

Recently, with the discovery of the parvulin class of PPIases, peptidyl-prolyl isomerization has been identified as a key step in cell cycle regulation, oncogenesis, signal transduction, and a multitude of other cellular processes. Pin1 is the best-characterized PPIase of the parvulins and selectively catalyzes cis/trans isomerization of peptide sequences containing the phospho-Ser/Pro or phospho-Thr/Pro motif (pS/T-P) (5Lu K.P.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) have proposed that, in the presence of certain kinases, Pin1 participates in a “tag and twist” mechanism to activate its substrate: the kinase phosphorylates the serine or threonine side chain (tagging), and Pin1 subsequently cis/trans isomerizes (twists) the peptide bond preceding proline in a di-peptide pS/T-P, thus introducing a marked kink in the backbone of the peptide chain. Substrates of Pin1 include the mitotic regulators (Cdc25 phosphatase (8Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol.

Pin1 is a two-domain protein of 18.4 kDa consisting of an N-terminal WW domain (Pin1WW) important for substrate targeting (15Sudol M. Sliwa K. Russo T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal catalytic domain (Pin1CAT), which changes the substrate conformation by catalyzing the cis/trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl imide bonds. Previously reported x-ray and NMR structures of full-length Pin1 (Pin1FL) reveal a global similarity of Pin1CAT with the FKBP-like class of PPIases and of Pin1WW with other WW domains found in single or tandem repeats in over 25 unrelated cell-signaling proteins (16Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Both domains selectively bind pS/T-P-containing substrate peptides, but only the catalytic domain isomerizes this sequence motif (7Zhou X.Z. Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Lu K.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Selectivity is achieved by specific phosphate-binding sites, of which one is located next to the active site of Pin1CAT and the other within the peptide binding epitope of Pin1WW. Two x-ray studies and one NMR study have characterized the Pin1-peptide interactions previously: Ranganathan et al. (17Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) have solved the structure Pin1FL in complex with the Ala-Pro-dipeptide (PDB entry 1PIN), which is presumed to bind to the active site of the catalytic domain. Verdecia et al. (18Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) have elucidated the structure of Pin1FL complexed to the doubly phosphorylated peptide YpSPTpSPS of the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II large subunit (PDB entry 1F8A). The NMR study of Wintjens et al. (19Wintjens R. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P. Buée L. Lippens G. Landrieu I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25150-25156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) compares the structure of free Pin1WW with Pin1WW in complex with peptides from the Cdc25 phosphatase (Cdc25) and the cytoskeletal protein tau (PDB entries 1I6C, 1I8G, and 1I8H). Wintjens et al. suggest a unique binding scheme in which the peptide substrates all bind in the same orientation with the peptidyl-prolyl bond being in the trans conformation. Pin1 encodes two functional elements, localization and catalysis, each in one separate domain. A flexible linker tethers both domains to one another. In terms of specificity toward proteins, it is functionally important to establish whether these domains are independent of one another or whether they interact in the absence and/or presence of the substrate. To address the impact of peptide binding on the inter-domain motion of the two domains of Pin1, we applied standard NMR methodology (20Ulmer T.S. Werner J.M. Campbell I.D. Structure. 2002; 10: 901-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Cornilescu G. Marquardt J.L. Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6836-6837Crossref Scopus (782) Google Scholar). We have determined the domain-domain interaction surface of Pin1 under solution conditions by differential chemical shift mapping. Estimated overall correlation times derived from both 15N spin relaxation data and HydroNMR calculations were analyzed to characterize the effects of peptide binding on the domain flexibility of Pin1FL. Furthermore, residual dipolar couplings provided additional supporting information about domain-domain orientation and motion (22Braddock D.T. Cai M. Baber J.L. Huang Y. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem.

Pons, submitted for publication. Brownian Dynamic simulations were performed to interpret the NMR relaxation properties of Pin1 with respect to global and inter-domain motion. Full-length Pin1 (Pin1FL) and the two domain fragments (Pin1WW+L and Pin1L+CAT) have been studied in the presence of the following three different peptides: (i) the peptideWFYpSPR (Pintide), which was originally designed from a peptide library to be an optimal substrate for Pin1 (38Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.-U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar); (ii) the doubly phosphorylated peptide YpSPTpSPS (CTD), which occurs as a heptad repeat in the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II; and (iii) the mono-phosphorylated peptide EQPLpTPVTDL (Cdc25), which is a model peptide from the essential mitotic phosphatase Cdc25 (1Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 2002; 3: 521-526Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Protein Production and Peptide Synthesis—Uniformly 15N-labeled Pin1WW+L, Pin1L+CAT, and Pin1FL were expressed and purified as described previously (27Jacobs D.M. Saxena K. Grimme S. Vogtherr M. Pescatore B. Langer T. Elshorst B. Fiebig K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The protein samples contained 100 mm imidazole (pH 6.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 0.03% NaN3, and 90% H2O/10% D2O. All three phosphopeptides were synthesized according to literature procedures. Phosphorylated amino acids were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem AG, Switzerland. Binding Assays—The Pin1-peptide binding studies were conducted by monitoring changes in 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The chemical shift changes, Δ, were calculated using Equation 1. Δ1H+15N=(Δ1H)2+(0.17Δ15N)2(Eq. 1) Generally, 0.25 mm protein solutions were employed. All three peptides were added in 8-fold excess. To measure the dissociation binding constants (K D) of Pintide and the CTD peptide binding to Pin1, HSQC spectra were recorded for a set of successively diluted samples with protein concentrations of 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.02 mm. For these the protein-peptide ratio was fixed at 1:4, and the chemical shift changes due to the dissociation of the protein-peptide complex at successively lower protein (and peptide) concentrations were monitored. The observed chemical shift changes (Δ1H+15N) were then fitted to the following expression by adjusting K D and A, Δ1H+15N=A25+KDP0-9+10KDP0+KDP02(Eq. 2) where P 0 is the total protein concentration, and A = δfree - δbound, i.e. the difference in chemical shift between the free (δfree) and bound (δbound) states. This equation has been derived from the mass law for the fixed protein-ligand ratio of 1:4 and results after substitution of Equation 4 into Equation 5 given in the literature (Ref. 26Kim S. Cullis D.N. Feig L.A. Baleja J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6776-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NMR Experiments and Data Analysis—All NMR experiments were recorded at 298 K on Bruker DRX800 and DRX600 spectrometers at 800- and 600-MHz proton resonance frequencies, respectively. Bruker Xwinnmr3.1 software and NMRView 5.0.4 (B. A. Johnson, Merck Research Laboratories) were used to process and analyze the data. All heteronuclear experiments were acquired with spectral widths of 31 ppm (F1) and 14 ppm (F2). Backbone amide {1H}-15N NOE, 15N R 1, 15N R 2 (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)) values were measured at 600 MHz with conventional pulse sequences (28Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was 0.5 mm. The CTD and Cdc25 peptides were added in 6-fold excess, whereas the concentration of Pintide was 2 mm due to its limited solubility. The 15N R 1 and the 15N R 2 relaxation decays were sampled at eight different time points each (T1 delays = 0.005, 0.079, 0.079, 0.159, 0.239, 0.239, 0.359, 0.519, 0.759, and 1.119 s; T2 delays = 0.009, 0.017, 0.017, 0.034, 0.060, 0.086, 0.086, 0.112, 0.148, and 0.190 s) with duplicate spectra for each time point. All spectra were acquired with 160 × 1024 complex points. A recycle delay of 4 s and eight transients were applied for the R 1 and R 2 experiments. For the unsaturated {1H}-15N NOE measurement, a recycle delay of 5 s was used. This recycle delay was substituted in the presaturated {1H}-15N NOE experiment with a 0.5-s delay followed by a 4.5-s long series of non-selective 120° 1H pulses separated by 5-ms delay. The NOE spectra were recorded in an interleaved manner with 32 transients each. Backbone amide 15N R 1 and R 2 relaxation rates were determined by fitting peak heights as functions of relaxation decay times to single-exponential decay functions. Steady-state NOE values were calculated from the ratios of the peak intensities with and without proton saturation (29Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The standard errors for R 1, R 2, and {1H}-15N NOE were estimated to 5%. From a total of 156 backbone 15N-amides, relaxation data were extracted for 118 residues of Pin1FL, for 111 of Pintide-bound Pin1WT, for 126 of CTD-bound Pin1FL, and for 120 of Cdc25-bound Pin1FL. For PinWW+L 46 out of 54 residues and for Pin1L+CAT 76 out of 109 residues were used for analysis. The residues Arg-17, Ser-18, Ser-19, Ser-42, Ser-43, Gly-44, Gln-75, Glu-76, and Glu-145 are not assigned. However, Ser-18 appears in the HSQC spectrum of peptide-bound Pin1FL. 29 residues in Pin1FL, 37 residues in Pintide-bound Pin1FL, 22 residues in CTD-bound Pin1FL, 28 in Cdc25-bound Pin1FL, and 27 residues in Pin1CAT exhibit spectral overlap. The residues from which relaxation data were obtained and those used to determine the estimated overall correlation times are listed in the supplementary material. The isotropic correlation times were calculated using the program Tensor 2.0 (30Dosset P. Hus J.-C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Two hundred Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to assess the validity of the isotropic diffusion model. Because the averaged correlation times are biased by the choice of residues, a range of correlation times was calculated resulting in deviations of 0.4 ns for Pin1WW and 0.1 ns for Pin1CAT. Because Pintide-bound Pin1FL is only saturated to ∼85%, the relaxation rates are extrapolated to 100% saturation as follows, R1,2extr=R1,2obs-(1-χbound)R1,2PinFLχbound(Eq. 3) where R1,2extr , R1,2obs , and R1,2PinFL are the R 1 and R 2 relaxation rates of saturated Pin1FL-Pintide complex, the non-saturated Pin1FL-Pintide complex, and the Apo-Pin1FL, respectively, and χbound is the fraction bound or degree of saturation. The above extrapolation requires that bound and free peptide be in fast exchange, which can be safely assumed because we observe an averaging of the chemical shifts of the bound and free state in all titration studies used to determine the K D values of the peptides. Dipolar Couplings—We employed two types of media for the partially aligned media, a nonionic liquid crystalline medium and bacteriophages. The liquid crystalline medium (49Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar) was prepared from 1-hexanol and C12E5 (Fluka). A 10% solution of this medium was prepared in buffer containing 10% D2O. This solution was added in equal amounts to a 1 mm protein stock solution, yielding a final 5% medium/0.5 mm protein solution. For samples containing peptide, solid peptide was added until a solid precipitate emerged. Aligning samples containing phages (50Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) were prepared by adding a concentrated solution of filamentous phage PF11 (resulting concentration 21 mg/ml; Asla Ltd., Riga, Latvia) to the protein solution. Alignment of the samples was monitored via the splitting of the deuterium signal. N-HN heteronuclear dipolar couplings of the sample containing phages were measured at 800 MHz using the IPAP scheme (31Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). N-HN heteronuclear dipolar couplings of the samples containing liquid crystalline medium were measured at 600 MHz as S3E spectra (32Meissner A. Duus J.Ø. S⊘rensen O.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In each case, 256 T1 data points were acquired and zero-filled to 1024 points. The splitting was evaluated using NMRView 5.0.4 (B. A. Johnson, Merck Research Laboratories). The RDC values were obtained by subtracting the reference value of the protein in isotropic solution. Like for evaluation of relaxation data, the dipolar couplings were extrapolated to 100% saturation. The fraction bound was 85% for the phage solution and only 40% for the nonionic liquid crystals. The low saturation degree for the nonionic liquid crystals is due to peptide binding to the liquid crystals. Because the extrapolation of the data from the nonionic liquid crystals is less accurate, the data from phage solution were assumed to be more reliable. For analysis of the data we used Pales (33Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and Module (34Al-Hashimi H.M. Valafar H. Terrell M. Zartler E.R. Eidsness M.K. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In Pales, the tensor values were obtained using the SVD (35Losonczi J.A. Andrec M. Fischer M.W.F. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 138: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and a maximum likelihood method (36Warren J.J. Moore P.B. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 149: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Q value (21Cornilescu G. Marquardt J.L. Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6836-6837Crossref Scopus (782) Google Scholar) was used to assess the agreement between experimental and theoretical values. The x-ray structures of Apo-Pin1 (PDB entry 1PIN) and of Pin1 bound to the CTD peptide (PDB entry 1F8A) were used for all models; for consistency, we used the residue numbering of 1PIN for both structures. Protons were added to both structures. In all cases, the WW domain loop (residues Ser-16 to Arg-21) and the flexible linker (residues Glu-35 to Ala-53) have been omitted from the analysis. Coordinate files with an aligned arrangement of the two domain were generated semi-manually with Module (37Dosset P. Hus J.-C. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The Two Domain Nature of Pin1 and the Role of the Flexible Linker—To characterize domain-domain interactions and dynamics NMR experiments were carried out on three different constructs of Pin1: (i) Pin1FL, the full-length protein (residues 1–163); (ii) Pin1WW+L, the isolated WW domain plus linker (residues 1–54); and (iii) Pin1L+CAT, the isolated catalytic domain plus linker (residues 44–163). The residue numbering refers to that of the PDB structure 1PIN. Notably, each of the single-domain constructs includes the linker. Hence, the effect of the absence of a domain is studied rather than the absence of the covalently attached linker. This ensures minimal structural and chemical shift perturbation within the single domain constructs. All three constructs have been studied in the presence of three different peptides, namely WFYpSPR (Pintide), YpSPTpSPS (CTD), and EQPLpTPVTDL (Cdc25). Differential Chemical Shift Mapping: Effect of the Linker— Fig. 1 shows the differences in chemical shifts between Pin1FL and either Pin1L+CAT or Pin1WW+L, mapped onto the x-ray structure of Ranganathan et al. (17Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). As also seen in Fig. 2A, the strongest chemical shift perturbations due to the presence of the second domain are found in the β3 strand as well as the β1/β2 and β2/β3 loops of the WW domain forming the ends of its concave surface. In the catalytic domain, the chemical shift changes are clustered around the strand β6 and helix α4. Observed perturbations within strand β7 are likely due to the influence of the linker communicating the absence of the WW domain. Weaker shift perturbations are found for individual residues distributed throughout the catalytic domain. Interestingly, the most affected regions describe the hydrophobic cavity comprising the concave surface of the WW domain and the back side (strand β6 and helix α4) of the catalytic domain. Ranganathan et al. (17Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) have also identified this inter-domain interaction surface in their x-ray structure. However, in this study helix α1, which is only weakly perturbed in solution, is also included in the interaction surface. Notably, Pin1At, a homologous cis/trans isomerase from Arabidopsis thaliana lacking the WW domain, consists of negatively charged residues at the comparable surface (Pin1At: Asp-105, Asp-108, Glu-51, and Asp-52; hPin1FL: Gly-148, Phe-151, Gln-94, and Lys-95) (39Landrieu I. Wieruszeski J.-M. Wintjens R. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pin1WW shields this surface of the catalytic domain. Hence, the two domains are most likely coupled by weak hydrophobic and hydrophilic inter-domain interactions and not directly by the linker, because this linker is too flexible to give rise to specific interactions. Interestingly, attractive forces between the domains are not large enough to persist without the linker. Mixing Pin1WW+L and Pin1L+CAT, at 0.25 mm concentration, did not show any chemical shift perturbations when compared with the shifts of the individual domains. These studies clearly establish that WW and catalytic domains interact and that one role of the linker is to increase the local concentrations of each of the domains with respect to each other. The recently solved solution structure of Pin1 by Bayer et al. (40Bayer E. Goettsch S. Mueller J.W. Griewel B. Guiberman E. Mayr L.M. Bayer P. J Biol. Chem. April 29, 2003; 278: 26183-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) confirms this weak interaction of both domains across the common binding interface, because no NOEs between the domains could be observed.Fig. 2A, 1H-15N chemical shift differences between Pin1FL and Pin1WW+L (yellow) and Pin1L+CAT (red).

In our studies the saturation of Pin1 with peptide was estimated to be 85% for Pintide (K D = 200–400 μm), 90% for the CTD peptide (K D = 200 μm), and 93% for the Cdc25 peptide (K D = 117 μm (19Wintjens R. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P. Buée L. Lippens G. Landrieu I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25150-25156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)). The affinities determined in this study for Pintide and the CTD peptide are about one order of magnitude larger than the dissociation constants reported by Verdecia et al. (18Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), who found values of 17 μm for Pintide and 10 μm for the CTD peptide. The differences are likely due to the lower pH in our study (6.6 versus 7.5), which alters the protonation state of the phosphate group and thus affects binding (41Zhang Y. Füssel S. Reimer U. Schutkowski M. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11868-11877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.-U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Besides, increasing salt concentration decreases dramatically the PPIase activity of Pin1 implying that charges within or near the PPIase active site are also critical for a productive interaction between Pin1 with its substrate (42Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.-U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Nevertheless the relative affinities for both peptides are reproduced as Pintide binds more strongly than the CTD peptide. Verdecia et al. (18Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) have reported that full-length Pin1 has higher apparent affinities to its substrates than its isolated domains. In Fig. 2 (B–D) chemical shift changes of three different peptides bound to each of the constructs (Pin1FL, Pin1L+CAT, or Pin1WW+L) are shown as a function of residue number. Peptide Binding to the Isolated Domains—The yellow data points in Fig. 2 show that all three peptides induce strong shift changes in Pin1WW+L. Almost all residues within the WW domain are affected indicating that the peptide binding is associated with conformational changes (19Wintjens R. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Rousselot-Pailley P.

https://openalex.org/W2058055671,"Manganous superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inducible gene product, plays an important role in removing superoxide anions produced inside mitochondria. Two regulatory regions, the proximal promoter region (PPR), which is upstream from the transcription initiation site, and the TNF-responsive element (TNFRE), which is inside intron 2, are responsible for Mn-SOD expression. To understand how each of these regions contributes to the transcription of Mn-SOD, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitations, and in vivo nuclease sensitivity assays were performed on the murine Mn-SOD gene. These assays demonstrate that Sp1 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 are required for Mn-SOD induction by TNF. Sp1 bound the PPR constitutively, whereas NF-κB p65 and C/EBP-β bound the TNFRE only after TNF treatment. Binding of C/EBP-β to the TNFRE was dependent on the presence of NF-κB p65. The chromatin structure within the TNFRE became more accessible to nuclease digestion after TNF treatment. This accessibility required Sp1 and NF-κB p65. Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of histone deacetylation, or transient transfection with coactivator-expressing plasmids, enhanced the expression of Mn-SOD. NF-κB p65 binding was required for acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the PPR and the TNFRE.

Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Google Scholar). The expression of Mn-SOD is important in protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage mediated by superoxide radicals generated during normal cellular metabolism or under conditions of inflammation and oxidative stress, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated apoptosis (2Aggarwal B.B. Natarajan K. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 93-124Google Scholar, 3Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3582-3592Google Scholar). The importance of Mn-SOD function is illustrated by the neonatal death of mice containing targeted disruptions of their Sod2 genes (4Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright J. Dionne L. Lu N.

A variety of factors, which include TNF, interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, interferon-γ, and x-ray irradiation, induce Mn-SOD transcription (6Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Google Scholar, 7Hirose K. Longo D.L. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 361-368Google Scholar, 8Akashi M. Hachiya M. Paquette R.L. Osawa Y. Shimizu S. Suzuki G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15864-15869Google Scholar). The important role of Mn-SOD in protection against inflammation and oxidative stress emphasizes the need to regulate Mn-SOD expression precisely. Sequence analysis, promoter mutagenesis, and in vivo genomic footprinting identified two regulatory regions separated by 2.2 kbp of DNA (Fig. 1) (9Jones P.L. Kucera G. Gordon H. Boss J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 155-161Google Scholar, 10Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Google Scholar). The 5′-proximal promoter region (PPR) contains numerous putative regulatory motifs that can be recognized by Sp1, AP-1, C/EBP, and NF-κB family members. Results of promoter mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the PPR contributed only a 1.7-fold increase to the total induced expression in response to TNF, indicating that TNF responsiveness was not within this region. However, in vivo genomic footprinting suggested a role for the Sp1 binding sequences in constitutive expression of Mn-SOD. A TNF-responsive element (TNFRE) was identified within the second intron of the Mn-SOD gene. Sequence analysis of this 238-bp element revealed numerous potential transcription factor binding sites. TNF induced the occupancy of the binding sites for NF-κB, C/EBP, and NF-1 within the TNFRE. In vitro DNA binding assays showed that the 5′-region of the TNFRE bound C/EBP-β, and the 3′-region bound C/EBP-β and NF-κB. One report suggested an NF-κB binding site (originally named as C/EBPX because of its homology to a C/EBP binding site) within the 5′-region of the TNFRE which is indispensable for the responsiveness to TNF (11Maehara K. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 77: 474-486Google Scholar). The 3′-NF-κB site, however, was not independently responsive to TNF and was suggested to provide position and orientation independence to the TNFRE in a heterologous setting (10Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Google Scholar). The intronic location of the TNFRE leads to an intriguing question about how the PPR and the TNFRE communicate over 2.2 kbp of DNA. The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into nucleosome and higher order structures of chromatin allows for the possibility that these two regulatory regions are physically close enough for direct interaction or communication through bridging molecules. The role of chromatin structure in Mn-SOD expression was suggested by the observation that the promoter of the rat Mn-SOD gene became more sensitive to DNase I after TNF treatment, indicating that some form of nucleosome remodeling occurred (12Kuo S. Chesrown S.E. Mellott J.K. Rogers R.J. Hsu J.L. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3345-3354Google Scholar). Whether the remodeling involves acetylation of specific lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of core histones or nucleosome repositioning is not known. To determine the role of chromatin in controlling the accessibility of transcription factors to the Mn-SOD gene, we examined changes in nuclease-hypersensitive sites, the requirement for coactivators that have the potential to modify chromatin, and examined changes in histone acetylation at both the PPR and the TNFRE of the Mn-SOD gene in response to TNF. Using transcription factor-deficient cell lines, Sp1 and NF-κB p65 were found to be required for the induction of Mn-SOD by TNF. The TNFRE but not the PPR became hypersensitive to nuclease after TNF treatment, and both Sp1 and NF-κB p65 were necessary for these changes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Sp1 bound PPR constitutively, whereas C/EBP-β and NF-κB p65 bound the TNFRE only after TNF induction, and the binding of C/EBP-β to DNA required NF-κB p65. In a NF-κB p65-dependent manner, TNF induced rapid changes in histone acetylation at both the PPR and the TNFRE. Overexpression of the transcriptional coactivators CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein) and p300 could enhance TNF-mediated expression, and E1a, an adenovirus inhibitor of CBP/p300 activity, blocked the induction. Taken together, these results suggest that induction of Mn-SOD by TNF requires communication between the PPR and the TNFRE, a process involving chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation that ultimately leads to the assembly of the transcription factor complex at the PPR and the TNFRE, and in turn gene activation. Cells and Reagents—NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The embryonic fibroblast cell line containing targeted disruptions of the NF-κB subunit p65 was provided by Dr. D. Baltimore (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Inc., Logan, UT), 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Human recombinant TNF-α (Genzyme, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and trichostatin A (TSA) were used at 500 units/ml and 150 ng/ml, respectively. To generate an embryonic fibroblast cell line that might have characteristics more similarly related to the p65–/– line, murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and cultured. The Sp1 knockout cell line was derived from embryonic stem cells containing a homozygous deletion in Sp1 gene as described previously (13Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Zhang F. Morris A. Philipsen S. Warren S.T. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1708-1714Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB p65 by TNF is normal in this cell line as determined by analysis of the IP-10 gene (13Ping D. Boekhoudt G.H. Zhang F. Morris A. Philipsen S. Warren S.T. Boss J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1708-1714Google Scholar). This analysis included mRNA production and in vivo genomic footprinting. No wild type line prepared in a mouse identical to the Sp1–/– is available. Sp1–/– cells were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1 mm l-glutamine, antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin), 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 4 μg/ml insulin. Plasmids and Transient Transfection—Plasmids expressing E1a, CBP, and p300 were provided by Drs. L. Gooding (Emory University), R. Goodman (The Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Science Center, Portland), and Y. Nakatani (Dana Farber Cancer Research Center, Boston), respectively. Transient transfection of NIH3T3 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following protocols provided by the manufacturer. Cells were treated with TNF at 24 h post-transfection and assayed for Mn-SOD transcripts by real time RT-PCR as indicated. Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For each sample, 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Parallel reactions without reverse transcriptase were included as negative controls. 1/50th of each reverse transcription reaction was analyzed in a PCR containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1× SYBR (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME), 0.04% gelatin, 0.3% Tween 20, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, Taq polymerase, and 50 nm of each primer. Real time PCR was conducted using a Bio-Rad i-cycler with denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 30 s for a total of 40 cycles. Two sets of PCR assays were performed for each sample using the following primers specific for cDNA of Mn-SOD and β-actin: 5SODRTE4, 5′-CATGTCTGTGGGAGTCCAAGGTTCAG and 3SODRTE5, 5′-GTCAATCCCCAGCAGCGGAATAAG; β-actin5-1, 5′-ACCAACTGGGACGATATGGAGAAGA; and β-actin3-1, 5′-TACGACCAGAGGCATACAGGGACAA. The threshold cycle number for Mn-SOD was normalized to that of β-actin mRNA, and the resulting value was converted to a linear scale. All assays were performed at least three times from independent RNA preparations. Adenovirus Infection—The adenovirus dl520 producing 12S E1A was obtained from Dr. L. Gooding. NIH3T3 cells were infected with dl520 following the procedures described previously (14Duerksen Hughes P. Wold W.S. Gooding L.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 4193-4200Google Scholar). At 24 h postinfection, cells were treated with TNF for 4 h. RNA was then prepared and assayed for Mn-SOD transcript by real time RT-PCR. Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) Sensitivity Assay—NIH3T3 cells were split and grown to about 80% confluence. The cells were washed once with cold washing solution containing 150 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 35 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm CaCl2. The cells were permeabilized for 1 min at room temperature with ice-cold 0.5 mg/ml lysolecithin (Sigma) dissolved in the above washing solution. After permeabilization, the cells were washed once with MNase buffer containing 150 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 2 mm CaCl2 followed by incubation with a different amount of MNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 5 min at room temperature. The digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of stop solution containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. After proteinase K digestion, genomic DNA was purified, and the 5′-ends of DNA were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Ligation-mediated PCR was then conducted as described previously (10Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Google Scholar) using primer sets specific for the regulatory region of Mn-SOD, which are listed in Table I.Table IPrimer sets specific for PPR and TNFRE of Mn-SOD genePrimersSequencesSet 11-15′-gacccacccgtaggggacg1-25′-ccctgccgctcacctgcac1-35′-ctgccgctcacctgcacgccSet 22-15′-cggcatcctgggaaggcaacg2-25′-gtgccaaattggtagaggccgcgtg2-35′-gtagaggccgcgtgcttgctacagccacSet 33-15′-gggcgtggctgtagcaagcac3-25′-caggggagacgttgccttcccagg3-35′-tgccttcccaggatgccgctccgttatgSet 44-15′-gaggggccctgattactccataatt4-25′-ttctgaccagcagcagagccttggc4-35′-ccagcagcagagccttggctttccggSet 55-15′-gagcgacctgagttgtaacatctcct5-25′-gcacctttaaaaaaacctgtcctcagcc5-35′-aaaacctgtcctcagccaggcaaaccaSet 66-15′-ggctccacagaaggattacaatcaag6-25′-aggaaatgctttcccaactgggctat6-35′-tttcccaactgggctattcccctgcttcSet 77-15′-gcgtcagatgtcattaaggatggtt7-25′-catgtggttgctggacctttggaa7-35′-gctggacctttggaagagctgtcattgc Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was performed as described previously (15Beresford G.W. Boss J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 652-657Google Scholar). Briefly, formaldehyde-cross-linked nuclei lysate prepared from 4 × 106 cells was sonicated and then mixed with 5 μg of antibody prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads and immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for overnight. The beads were then washed, and the immunoprecipitated DNA·protein complex was eluted from the beads. After proteinase K digestion and phenol extraction, the eluted DNA was precipitated, dissolved in water, and used as template in real time PCR. Anti-p65, anti-C/EBP-β, and anti-Sp1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-acetylated histone H3 and anti-acetylated histone H4 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Quantitative PCR was performed in a Bio-Rad i-cycler. The following primer sets were used for the PPR: SOD5′5-3, 5′-GCCTCTACCAATTTGGCACAGG and SOD5′3-3, 5′-GAACACGGCCGTTCGCTCG. PCRs were performed for a total of 50 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 68 °C for 1 min each. For the TNFRE, the primers SODRE5-1, 5′-GGATTTTTGGAAATTGCAGATCTGGG, and SODRE3-2, 5′-GGCTCCACAGAAGGATTACAATCAAGA, were used in a PCR for 50 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Real time PCR was performed as above. The amount of immunoprecipitated DNA was determined by comparison of the threshold cycle value with a standard curve generated using a known amount of genomic DNA as template. To correct for differences in chromatin preparations among samples, the values of immunoprecipitated DNA were normalized to the amount of chromatin DNA added to each ChIP reaction. Sp1 and NF-κB p65 Are Required for the TNF Induction of Mn-SOD—Induction of Mn-SOD expression by TNF is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level in murine fibroblasts (10Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Google Scholar, 16Davis C.A. Monnier J.M. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37317-37326Google Scholar). In vitro DNA binding assays and in vivo genomic footprinting analysis of the regulatory region of the Mn-SOD gene suggest roles for Sp1 in binding to the PPR and for NF-κB binding to the TNFRE in response to TNF (10Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Google Scholar, 11Maehara K. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 77: 474-486Google Scholar, 17Maehara K. Hasegara T. Xiao H. Takeuchi A. Abe R. Isobe K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 115-119Google Scholar). To characterize further the roles of Sp1 and NF-κB in TNF induction of Mn-SOD, the level of Mn-SOD transcript in control and TNF-treated NIH3T3, Sp1–/–, and p65–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts was analyzed by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Basal Mn-SOD expression was similar among the tested cell lines. The addition of TNF rapidly induced the expression of Mn-SOD in the NIH3T3 but not in the Sp1–/– and p65–/– cells, indicating that both Sp1 and p65 are required for TNF induction of Mn-SOD in vivo. The transcription of β-actin gene, which is not regulated by TNF, was not induced (data not shown). A freshly isolated murine embryonic cell line was also analyzed for its ability to induce Mn-SOD in response to TNF. Real time RT-PCR found that Mn-SOD mRNA was induced in this line, but with slower kinetics, peaking at 24 h (Fig. 2B). Even at 24 h of TNF treatment, no Mn-SOD mRNA was induced in either the Sp1- or p65-deficient lines (data not shown). TNF Induces Chromatin Accessibility at the TNFRE—Chromatin structure and its remodeling in response to extracellular signals have been shown to play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation of interleukin-12, interleukin-4, interferon-γ, human immunodeficiency virus-1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pho5 genes, and the murine mammary tumor virus (18Weinmann A.S.

To determine whether changes in chromatin structure contribute to the regulation of Mn-SOD expression, MNase sensitivity assays were performed. MNase preferentially cuts DNA in nucleosome-free regions as well as in linker regions between nucleosomes. Digestion with two different concentrations of MNase was performed on TNF-treated and control NIH3T3 cells after permeabilization with lysolecithin. Permeabilization procedures prevent potential artifacts formed during nuclei preparation (22Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Google Scholar, 25Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Google Scholar). The MNase-digested genomic DNA was purified and analyzed by ligation-mediated PCR using primers that amplified the PPR and the TNFRE of the Mn-SOD gene. Strong hypersensitive banding patterns were formed on the PPR coding strand (Fig. 3, A–D) (–32 to +41) and noncoding strand (–48 to –1), indicating that the region was accessible to the nuclease and is in an “open” configuration. An MNase-resistant region (–259 to –206 and –168 to –32 on the coding strand, and –257 to –161 and –87 to –48 on the noncoding strand) was found to overlap the proposed Sp1-binding sites of the PPR. Detection of this hyposensitive region was not a consequence of sequence preference for MNase cleavage, as naked DNA was cleaved by MNase at this region. Combining the data into a summary schematic (Fig. 4) suggests that the MNase resistant region spans ∼227 bp just upstream from the transcription initiation site.Fig. 4Summary of MNase sensitivity experiments. A schematic of the PPR and the TNFRE regions analyzed by MNase digestion in Fig. 3A, Fig. 3G is shown. For the PPR, open boxes and solid boxes indicate MNase-hyposensitive and -hypersensitive regions, respectively. For the TNFRE, gray boxes indicate the hypersensitive regions that become hyposensitive after TNF treatment, and hatched boxes indicate hyposensitive regions that become hypersensitive after TNF treatment. The asterisks (*) above the hatched boxes indicate TNF-induced changes that also occur in the Sp1–/– cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MNase digestion at the TNFRE (Fig. 3, E–G, Fig. 3, E–G) revealed three hyposensitive regions on the coding strand (+2135 to +2145, +2240 to +2342, and +2393 to +2473), and two on the noncoding strand (+2127 to +2141 and +2218 to +2362). These regions overlap the binding sites of C/EBP-2, NF-κB, and NF-1. In addition, a strong hypersensitive region overlapping C/EBP-1 and C/EBPX was detected (+2145 to +2220 and +2162 to +2229 on the coding strand, and +2185 to +2197 on the noncoding strand). Within 30 min of TNF treatment, a slight increase in MNase cleavage was observed within the potential nucleosomal region on the coding strand of the PPR, whereas the hypersensitive bands (–48 to +41) on the coding and noncoding strands maintained their intensity (Fig. 3, A and C). In contrast, pronounced changes were found inside the TNFRE after 30 min of TNF induction. On both strands of the TNFRE, TNF-induced hypersensitive bands were observed within the three hyposensitive regions, whereas the hypersensitive bands overlapping C/EBP-1 and C/EBPX became less pronounced (Fig. 3, E–G, Fig. 3, E–G). The alterations in the patterns are represented in the summary diagram (Fig. 4). The hypersensitive banding patterns induced by TNF might indicate repositioning, destabilization, or disruption of nucleosomes at those regions. Assembly of a transcription factor complex at C/EBP-1 and C/EBPX could reduce the MNase accessibility to that region, leading to hyposensitive changes. It is important to note that the MEF line produced pattern similar to those of the NIH3T3 line, suggesting that both of these lines represent a wild type condition. NF-κB p65 and Sp1 Are Necessary for TNF-induced Chromatin Remodeling—The RT-PCR experiments in Fig. 2 demonstrate that Sp1 and NF-κB p65 were required for the induction of Mn-SOD by TNF. To determine whether the TNF-induced changes in chromatin structure observed above are also dependent upon Sp1 or NF-κB p65, MNase hypersensitivity assays were performed on Sp1- and NF-κB p65-deficient fibroblast cell lines. In the absence of TNF treatment, the banding patterns at the PPR and the TNFRE in both mutant cells were indistinguishable from those detected in wild type cells. After TNF treatment, the p65–/– cell line failed to display any TNF-induced changes in the MNase sensitivity pattern (Fig. 3A, Fig. 3G), whereas the Sp1–/– cell line showed only slight increases in MNase cleavage within the PPR coding strand (Fig. 3A) and one hyposensitive region of the TNFRE (+2240 to +2342 and +2233 to +2282 on the coding strand, and +2218 to +2362 on the noncoding strand; Fig. 3, E–G, Fig. 3, E–G). In addition, the TNF-induced hypersensitive region (+2135 to +2145) was still detected upstream from the C/EBP-1 and C/EBPX in Sp1–/– cells (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that both Sp1 and p65 are required for the observed chromatin structure changes in NIH3T3 and MEF wild type cells. These changes are functionally related to Mn-SOD induction by TNF and potentially are accomplished through interaction between the PPR and the TNFRE. To examine the relative levels of p65, Sp1, and C/EBP in the different cell lines, Western blot analysis was performed (Fig. 5). The results showed that Sp1–/–, NIH3T3, and the MEF cell lines contained equal levels of p65. Additionally, p65–/– and the MEF cell lines contained equal levels of Sp1, whereas NIH3T3 cells contained about one-third of the level. The Sp1-deficient cell line showed the appropriate band for the mutant protein. Equal levels of C/EBP-β expression were observed in NIH3T3, Sp1–/–, and p65–/– cell lines. Transcription Factor Assembly on Chromatin in Response to TNF—Family members of Sp1, NF-κB, and C/EBP have been shown to bind regulatory regions of Mn-SOD through in vitro analysis (10Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Google Scholar, 11Maehara K. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 77: 474-486Google Scholar, 17Maehara K. Hasegara T. Xiao H. Takeuchi A. Abe R. Isobe K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 115-119Google Scholar). In vivo genomic footprinting also confirmed the occupancy of several consensus binding sequences for Sp1 at the PPR and for NF-κB and C/EBP at the TNFRE (10Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Google Scholar). To determine whether these transcription factors bind to the Mn-SOD gene under in vivo conditions, ChIP assays coupled with quantitative real time PCR analysis of the precipitated DNA were performed. Antibodies against Sp1, NF-κB p65, and C/EBP-β were used. The results showed that p65 and C/EBP-β were induced to bind the TNFRE in response to TNF with 13.8-fold and 30-fold increase in the amount of DNA precipitated in TNF-treated cells compared with control cells, respectively (Fig. 6). In addition, the binding of the two factors occurred as early as 30 min post-TNF treatment. A small increase in p65 binding to the PPR was also detected. No significant change in the amount of Sp1 antibody-precipitated PPR DNA was observed after TNF treatment. Compared with the no antibody control, only a background level of Sp1 antibody-precipitated DNA containing the TNFRE was detected, demonstrating that Sp1 does not bind directly to this region. These results are consistent with the model that TNF induces p65 and C/EBP-β to bind the TNFRE, whereas Sp1 constitutively binds the PPR. C/EBP-β Binds the TNFRE in a p65-dependent Manner—To investigate further factor assembly at the Mn-SOD gene, ChIP assays using antibodies against Sp1, p65, and C/EBP-β were performed on Sp1- and p65-deficient cell lines. The results showed that p65 failed to bind the Mn-SOD regulatory regions in both mutant cell lines, whereas Sp1 only bound the PPR constitutively in p65–/– cells. In contrast, C/EBP-β was still induced by TNF to bind the TNFRE in Sp1–/–, but not p65–/– cells (Fig. 6). However, the magnitude of C/EBP-β binding in Sp1–/– cells was about 4-fold less than that in NIH3T3 cells. The failure of C/EBP-β binding to the TNFRE in p65–/– cells was not the result of the availability of C/EBP-β because similar amounts of C/EBP-β were expressed in NIH3T3, Sp1–/–, and p65–/– lines (Fig. 5). These results suggest that: 1) the presence of p65 is required for the binding of C/EBP-β to the TNFRE of Mn-SOD; and 2) efficient assembly of transcription factors on the TNFRE requires Sp1 binding to the PPR located 2.2 kbp upstream. E1a Represses Mn-SOD Induction by TNF—In addition to potential direct interactions between the regions, it is possible that transcriptional coactivators could contribute to the observed dependence of the TNFRE on the binding of Sp1 to the PPR. Moreover, the activation of gene transcription can be facilitated by transcription factor-mediated recruitment of coactivators to promoters (for review, see Ref. 26Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Google Scholar). The adenovirus protein E1a is known to repress transcription of some cellular genes by inhibiting the function of CBP/p300 (27Dorsman J.C. Teunisse A.F.

https://openalex.org/W2058149643,"Plant β-glucosidases display varying substrate specificities. The maize β-glucosidase isozyme Glu1 (ZmGlu1) hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of substrates in addition to its natural substrate DIMBOA-Glc (2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxaxin-3-one), whereas the sorghum β-glucosidase isozyme Dhr1 (SbDhr1) hydrolyzes exclusively its natural substrate dhurrin (p-hydroxy-(S)-mandelonitrile-β-d-glucoside). Structural data from cocrystals of enzyme-substrate and enzyme-aglycone complexes have shown that five amino acid residues (Phe198, Phe205, Trp378, Phe466, and Ala467) are located in the aglycone-binding site of ZmGlu1 and form the basis of aglycone recognition and binding, hence substrate specificity. To study the mechanism of substrate specificity further, mutant β-glucosidases were generated by replacing Phe198, Phe205, Asp261, Met263, Phe377, Phe466, Ala467, and Phe473 of Glu1 by Dhr1 counterparts. The effects of mutations on enzyme activity and substrate specificity were studied using both natural and artificial substrates. The simple mutant replacing Phe198 by a valine had the most drastic effect on activity, because the capacity of this enzyme to hydrolyze β-glucosides was almost completely abolished. The analysis of this mutation was completed by a structural study of the double mutant ZmGlu1-E191D,F198V in complex with the natural substrate. The structure reveals that the single mutation F198V causes a cascade of conformational changes, which are unpredictable by standard molecular modeling techniques. Some other mutations led to drastic effects: replacing Asp261 by an asparagine decreases the catalytic efficiency of this simple mutant by 75% although replacing Tyr473 by a phenylalanine increase its efficiency by 300% and also provides a new substrate specificity by hydrolyzing dhurrin.

In bacteria and fungi, the cellulolytic β-glucosidases are key enzymes in biomass conversion (1Beguin P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 219-248Google Scholar, 2Fowler T. ACS Symp. Ser. 1993; 533: 56-65Google Scholar). In higher plants, β-glucosidases are known to be implicated in defense against pests (3Niemeyer H.M. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 3349-3358Google Scholar, 4Poulton J.E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 401-405Google Scholar), phytohormone activation (5Brzobohaty B. Moore I. Kristoffersen P. Bako L. Campos N. Schell J. Palme K. Science. 1993; 262: 1051-1054Google Scholar, 6Falk A. Rask L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1369-1377Google Scholar), lignification (7Dharmawardharna D.P. Ellis B.E. Carlson J.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 331-339Google Scholar), and cell wall catabolism (8Leah R. Kigel J. Svendsen I. Mundy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15789-15797Google Scholar). They belong to families 1 and 3 of the glycoside hydrolases and hydrolyze either O-linked β-glycosidic bonds (β-d-glucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.21), or S-linked β-glycosidic bonds (myrosinase or β-d-thioglucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.147). Thus, enzymes in family 1 hydrolyze substrates of the type G-O/S-X, where G indicates the glucosyl residue and X can either be another glycosyl residue or a non-carbohydrate aglycone group. The nature of the aglycone moiety of substrates is believed to be critical for the physiological functions of these enzymes. In maize (Zea mays L.), the major function of β-glucosidases (DIMBOA-glucosidases) 1The abbreviations used are: DIMBOA, 2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxaxin-3-one; ABTS, 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid. is in defense against the European corn borer and other pests (3Niemeyer H.M. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 3349-3358Google Scholar). The catalytically active form of both maize and sorghum β-glucosidases is a 120-kDa homodimer or its multimers (9Hosel W. Tober I. Eklund S.H. Conn E.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 152-162Google Scholar, 10Esen A. Gungor G. ACS Symp. Ser. 1993; 533: 214-239Google Scholar), which are also confirmed by x-ray crystallography (11Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Bevan R.B. Henrissat B. Esen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13555-13560Google Scholar). The primary structures of maize and sorghum β-glucosidases contain the highly conserved peptide motifs TFNEP and ITENG, which contain the two glutamic acids (Glu191 and Glu406, numbering of ZmGlu1, Fig. 1) involved in catalysis as the general acid/base catalyst and the nucleophile, respectively, in all family 1 β-glucosidases (12San-Aparicio J. Hermoso J.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Laquerica J.L. Polaina J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 491-502Google Scholar). These residues form part of a slot-like active site (13Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Google Scholar) and are required in the two steps of the substrate hydrolysis (14Withers G.S. Warren R.A.J. Street I.P. Rupitz K. Kempton J.B. Aebersold R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5887-5889Google Scholar). In the glycosylation step, the nucleophilic Glu406 attacks the anomeric carbon (C-1) of the substrate and forms a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate with concomitant release of the aglycone after protonation of the glucosidic oxygen by the acid catalyst Glu191 (14Withers G.S. Warren R.A.J. Street I.P. Rupitz K. Kempton J.B. Aebersold R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5887-5889Google Scholar). In the deglycosylation step, Glu191 acts as a base catalyst to activate a water molecule, which performs a nucleophilic attack on the covalent glycosyl-enzyme, releasing the glucose and regenerating the nucleophilic Glu406. The two catalytic glutamic acids (i.e. the nucleophile and the acid/base catalyst) of ZmGlu1 are positioned within the active site at expected distances (∼5.5 Å) for this mechanism (15Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Burmeister W.P. Bevan R.B. Henrissat B. Esen A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 37-46Google Scholar). Although much progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of catalysis and defining the roles of the two catalytic glutamates (14Withers G.S. Warren R.A.J. Street I.P. Rupitz K. Kempton J.B. Aebersold R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5887-5889Google Scholar, 16Wang Q. Trimbur D. Graham R. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14554-14562Google Scholar), one fundamental question about β-glucosidase-catalyzed reactions still remains to be answered: what determines the precise substrate specificity, including the site and mechanism of aglycone binding? Until recently, there was little or no information as to how β-glucosidases recognize their substrates and interact with them, specifically the aglycone moiety, which is the basis of tremendous diversity in natural substrates and is responsible for subtle substrate specificity differences among β-glucosidases. Recently, using the sorghum β-glucosidase Dhr1 and maize β-glucosidase Glu1 chimeras, Cicek et al. (18Cicek M. Blanchard D. Bevan D.R. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20002-20011Google Scholar) have determined that the aglycone (i.e. substrate) specificity-determining sites are different in ZmGlu1 and SbDhr1. These two enzymes provide an ideal model system to address questions related to substrate specificity, because they represent extremes in substrate specificity. SbDhr1 hydrolyzes only its natural substrate dhurrin, whereas ZmGlu1 hydrolyzes a broad spectrum of artificial and natural substrates, including its natural substrate DIMBOA-Glc, but it does not hydrolyze dhurrin. Cicek et al. (18Cicek M. Blanchard D. Bevan D.R. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20002-20011Google Scholar) showed that specificity for dhurrin hydrolysis resides mostly in a C-terminal octapeptide (462SSGYTERF469) of SbDhr1 where SbDhr1 and ZmGlu1 sequences differ from each other by four amino acid substitutions, although specificity for DIMBOA-Glc hydrolysis is not within the homolog of the aforementioned octapeptide in ZmGlu1, nor within the extreme 47-amino acid long C-terminal domain of ZmGlu1. The recently resolved crystal structures of ZmGlu1 (11Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Bevan R.B. Henrissat B. Esen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13555-13560Google Scholar, 15Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Burmeister W.P. Bevan R.B. Henrissat B. Esen A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 37-46Google Scholar) provided new insights into the identity of the amino acids within the active site that are involved in aglycone recognition and binding (i.e. substrate specificity). The data showed that the aglycone moiety of the substrate is sandwiched between Trp378 on one side and Phe198, Phe205, and Phe466 on the other. The major mechanism of aglycone recognition and binding appears to be aromatic stacking and π-interactions between aromatic aglycones and the above mentioned amino acids. Moreover, several others amino acids (e.g. Pro377, Asp261, Met263, Ala467, and Tyr473) were identified to be potentially involved in substrate specificity (11Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Bevan R.B. Henrissat B. Esen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13555-13560Google Scholar). The purpose of the study described in this paper was to investigate further the mechanism of substrate (aglycone) recognition and binding in β-glucosidases using the maize isozyme ZmGlu1 and the sorghum isozyme SbDhr1 as model systems. To this end, we have produced site-directed mutants of ZmGlu1 and chimeric enzymes, which had been produced by reciprocal domain-swapping between ZmGlu1 and SbDhr1 and used in a previously published study (18Cicek M. Blanchard D. Bevan D.R. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20002-20011Google Scholar). The targeted residues were chosen based on their localization in the active site aglycone binding pocket, as derived from the structural data, and on amino acid sequence comparisons between ZmGlu1 and SbDhr1 (Fig. 1). Subsequently, the mutant F198V, having the most drastic effect on enzyme activity, was submitted to a crystallographic structure analysis in complex with the natural substrate. We demonstrate that at least three residues were critical in ZmGlu1 substrate (i.e. aglycone) specificity and that a single amino acid change allows this protein to hydrolyze dhurrin. Implications of these findings on general β-glucosidase specificity are also discussed. General Methods—Manipulation of DNA and Escherichia coli were performed using standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.7-1.85Google Scholar). DNA synthesis by the PCR was performed with the high fidelity Pfu™ Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). DNA was purified from gel with the QiaQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). All restriction enzymes were from Stratagene and T4 DNA ligase from Promega. All constructs were sequenced for confirmation in the VBI Core Laboratory Facility (Blacksburg, VA). Mutagenesis of β-Glucosidases—The criteria for choosing the targeted residues was their localization in the active site aglycone binding pocket of the ZmGlu1 protein and amino acid sequence comparisons between ZmGlu1 and SbDhr1. The double mutant ZmGlu1-E191D,F198V was produced and overexpressed for the purpose of the structural analysis in complex with the natural substrate. For that reason, it was necessary to additionally mutate the acid base residue, to be sure to obtain a completely inactive enzyme. Mutated cDNAs were constructed by the PCR-mediated overlap extension using a pair of complementary primers (sense:pS and antisense:pA) as described (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar, 21Cicek M. Esen A. Biotech. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 392-400Google Scholar) and vector-specific primers T7prom (sense) (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′)) and T7term (antisense) (5′-ATGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGT-3′). The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. The DNA templates used in this study were PET21a-ZmGlu1, pET21a-Chim16, and pET21a-Chim21, which were previously used for expression in E. coli and subsequent purification in our laboratory (11Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Bevan R.B. Henrissat B. Esen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13555-13560Google Scholar). The T7prom-pA and T7term-pS PCR products were gel purified and combined in the second PCR step using T7prom and T7term oligonucleotides to obtain the full-length mutated cDNA. The resulting PCR product was gel purified, digested with NheI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned into the expression plasmid pET28a (Novagen). This plasmid allows the fusion of His-tagged residue extension at the N-terminal part of the mutated β-glucosidases, allowing purification on a Ni2+ column (see below).Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used to generate mutant maize (ZmGlu1) and sorghum (SbDhr1) β-glucosidasesOligonucleotide sequence 5′-3′Mutation introducedCATTTACTTCCGTTTCCTACGGAACZmGlu1-F198VCCGTTTCCTACGGAACTGGGGTCCTTGZmGlu1-F198V,F205LGGGCTTGCGTTTAACGTAATGGGZmGlu1-D261NCGTATTCGGTCGTGTGCCATACGGZmGlu1-M263FGGGAAATGCATGGATCTACATGTACZmGlu1-P377ACCGAACGTTTTGGCATTGTCTACGZmGlu1-Y473FCTTTTTCCTATGGAACTGGAGTCTTTGSbDhr1-V196F,L203FGTACATATTGATCCACGGATTTCCAGTAGGSbDhr1-A375PCCGAGCGTTACGGCATCGTCSbDhr1-F469Y Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Recombinant β-Glucosidases by Ni2+Column Chromatography—Wild type, chimeric and mutated β-glucosidases were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLys cells (F-ompT hsdSP rB-mB-gal dcm) (Stratagene) under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the expression plasmid pET28a (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C until A600 nm = 0.5, and recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for4hat22 °C. Cell lysis was performed using 10 ml of extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 units of DNase I) for1gof cell pellet using a French Press (3 × 15,000 psi), and the extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The cell debris pellet was extracted 2 more times with 5 ml of extraction buffer. All protein-containing supernatants were pooled, applied on the His-Bind™ (Ni2+ resin) column, and purified as recommended by Novagen. Ammonium sulfate was added to purified protein to a final concentration of 1.0 m and the solution was centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to HiTrap Phenyl-HP (Amersham Biosciences) column and the protein was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a 0.8 to 0.2 m ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0) gradient. Purified β-glucosidase preparations were checked for purity by SDS-PAGE on a standard 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.7-1.85Google Scholar) and their protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as standard. Enzyme Assays—Kinetic parameters, Km and kcat (Vmax/Ett) for the wild-type enzymes (ZmGlu1 and SbDhr1), chimeric constructs (chimeras 16 and 21), and mutated β-glucosidases were determined by varying the substrate concentration from 0.078 to 25 mm in citrate-phosphate (100/50 mm) buffer (pH 5.8) for the artificial substrates oNPGlc and pNPGlc and from 0.039 to 2.5 mm for 4MUGlc. For the natural substrate dhurrin, the range of substrate concentration was from 0.01 to 2.5 mm. oNPGlc, pNPGlc, and 4MUGlc assays were performed in quadruplicate in a microcentrifuge tube for 10 min at 37 °C by mixing 25 μl of substrate with 25 μl of enzyme solution (25 to 100 ng of enzyme), and the reaction was stopped by boiling the samples at 100 °C for 3 min. Then, the glucose release was determined by the peroxidase/glucose-oxidase-coupled reaction (22Raabo E. Terkilesen T.C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1960; 12: 402-408Google Scholar) by adding 100 μl of peroxidase/glucose-oxidase enzymes and 50 μl of ABTS (2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the absorbance was read in a microtiter plate reader at 410 nm. Because dhurrin is not resistant to the enzyme-heat inactivation step, dhurrinase activity was monitored by mixing 25 μl of substrate, 25 μl of enzyme solution, 100 μl of peroxidase/glucose/oxidase enzymes, and 50 μl of ABTS in a microtiter plate. The absorbance was read at 410 nm after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Crystal Structure Determination of ZmGlu1-E191D,F198V in Complex with DIMBOA-Glucoside—The crystals were grown under similar conditions as the native enzyme (15Czjzek M. Cicek M. Zamboni V. Burmeister W.P. Bevan R.B. Henrissat B. Esen A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 37-46Google Scholar). Two μl of the protein solution was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir containing 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.5), 22% PEG 4000, and 5% isopropyl alcohol. The crystals belong to space group P21 and have unit cell parameters a = 58.1 Å, b = 114.1 Å, and c = 80.1 Å, β = 93.88°. The ZmGlu1-E191D,F198V·DIMBOA-Glc complex was obtained in soaking experiments, in which 92 μl of the crystallization solution was mixed with 5 μl of glycerol (the cryoprotectant) and 3 μl of ligand (10 mm) solution. Subsequently, 45.5 μl of this mixture was supplemented with 2.5 μl of glycerol and 2 μl of ligand solution. The crystals were soaked in these two solutions for 1 h and then frozen in a stream of N2 at 100 K. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.9 Å. Data were collected at the synchrotron ESRF (Grenoble, France) on beam-line ID14-EH4. The data set was treated with DENZO (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA, part of the CCP4 package (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) and the native maize β-glucosidase (Protein Data Bank accession code 1e1e) as the model. Two solutions were obtained, which correspond to the two molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry, with a correlation coefficient of 70% and an R factor of 31.1% in the resolution range of 15.0 to 4.2 Å. The complex was analyzed with SIGMAA (24Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) weighted Fobs – Fcalc maps calculated with model phases. The final R and Rfree factors for the complexed ZmGlu1-E191D,F198V are 18.4 and 22.1%, respectively. A model of the ZmGlu1-E191D,F198V mutant structure was produced with the homology modeling program MODELLER (26Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Google Scholar) starting with the crystal structure of ZmGlu1-E191D (Protein Data Bank code 1E4L) and introducing the single mutation F198V into the sequence to be modeled (data not shown). N-terminal His-tagged Glu1 Is Fully Active in Vitro—Because our goal was the characterization of a large number of β-glucosidases, we chose to use polyhistidine-tagged β-glucosidases to speed up protein purification. Thus we first had to demonstrate that the addition of such a His6 extension does not affect β-glucosidase stability and activity in vitro. For this, we chose the ZmGlu1 β-glucosidase, and cloned its cDNA into an expression plasmid, pET28a, using the NheI/XhoI restriction sites to fuse a polyhistidine extension at the N-terminal end. The recombinant protein was then produced in E. coli and purified on a Ni2+ column. The in vitro activity of the His6-tagged and the native ZmGlu1 β-glucosidases were tested on the artificial substrates oNPGlc and pNPGlc. No significant differences in stability and kinetic parameters were observed between the 2 forms (data not shown). Subsequently, all β-glucosidases used in this study were produced with an N-terminal His6 tag. Substrate Specificity and Kinetics of Wild-type Enzymes and Site-directed Mutants on Artificial Substrates—The catalytic activity of wild-type and mutant enzymes was assayed toward three artificial substrates (oNPGlc, pNPGlc, and 4MUGlc) in solution and the kinetic parameters (Km, kcat, and kcat/Km) were determined.

Open table in a new tab The results obtained on Chim16 and Chim21 in this study are similar to those previously published (18Cicek M. Blanchard D. Bevan D.R. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20002-20011Google Scholar) in that both chimeric enzymes show increased catalytic efficiency, as compared with the parental ZmGlu1, in pNPGlc hydrolysis (284 and 358% reported here, compared with 340 and 380% increase in the previous study (18Cicek M. Blanchard D. Bevan D.R. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20002-20011Google Scholar)). However, the reported kinetic parameters of parental enzymes and chimeras are slightly different (i.e. for ZmGlu1: Km of 0.64 mm instead of 0.38 mm and kcat of 29.5 s–1 instead of 24.2 s–1) from those published by Cicek et al. (18Cicek M. Blanchard D. Bevan D.R. Esen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20002-20011Google Scholar), but similar to the one published of Zouhar et al. (27Zouhar J. Vévodová J. Marek J. Damborský J. Su X.D. Brzobohatý B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 973-985Google Scholar) (Km of 0.64 mm and kcat of 28 s–1 reported for ZmGlu1). First, we analyzed the effect of substitutions at the three phenylalanines forming one wall of the aglycone binding site of the slot-like active site on the activity and substrate specificity of mutant enzymes. Of the three single mutants, the F205L mutant shows no significant effect on pNPGlc hydrolysis other than doubling the kcat. In contrast, the F198V and F466S single mutations had drastic effects on catalytic efficiency. For example, single mutant F466S exhibits a marked increase in relative efficiency in comparison to wild-type ZmGlu1 on all substrates tested (from 28 to 123%), because of increased substrate turnover (e.g. 4 times better for pNPGlc hydrolysis). As for the F198V mutant, the kcat of 4MUGlc hydrolysis is reduced by about 90% resulting in a 82% reduction in relative efficiency, whereas the hydrolysis of other artificial substrates is drastically reduced. For example, the F198V mutant is unable to hydrolyze pNPGlc and shows only a negligible activity toward oNPGlc (7% of the relative efficiency of the wild-type enzyme). Furthermore, adding the double F198V,F205L substitutions to Ch16 or Ch21 results in a 90% decrease in relative efficiency compared with the parental chimeric enzymes on all three substrates tested. It is also interesting to note that both kcat and Km are affected by these substitutions in the chimeric enzymes, where Km was increased by 2-fold for pNPGlc and up to 5-fold for oNPGlc with a concomitant decrease of the kcat. These results point out the critical role of Phe198 in substrate recognition and binding by ZmGlu1, even though the generally observed decrease in activity stays context specific, which was also observed by Zouhar et al. (27Zouhar J. Vévodová J. Marek J. Damborský J. Su X.D. Brzobohatý B. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 973-985Google Scholar). When reciprocal mutations (Dhr1-V196F and L203F) were made in SbDhr1, the mutant enzymes were still not able to hydrolyze any of the artificial substrates tested (cf. Table III). Again, Chim16 and Chim21 show increased relative efficiency in the hydrolysis of all substrates tested. These chimeras introduce 9 and 4 amino acid substitutions, respectively, from SbDhr1 to the parental ZmGlu1, where the 4 substitutions of Chim21 are shared with Chim16 (Fig. 2). Among these substituted amino acids, only Phe466 and Ala467 are located in the aglycone binding site, although Tyr473 is only indirectly but profoundly affecting substrate specificity because it forms a hydrogen bond with Trp378, which in turn is directly involved in aglycone binding. We therefore analyzed only the kinetic parameters of the F466S, A467S, and Y473F mutants. Among these residues, the A467S substitution in ZmGlu1 has no detectable effect on substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency in the case of pNPGlc or oNPGlc hydrolysis, and only a lower Km is obtained for 4MUGlc (0.49 mm F466S,A467S versus 0.79 mm for F466S). As mentioned before, the F466S substitution did not produce as clear effects on substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency as did the Y473F substitution. The single Y473F mutation in ZmGlu1 affects profoundly the catalytic behavior of ZmGlu1 because the kcat of this mutant is increased by 110 to 450% over the wild-type enzymes, depending on substrates tested. Nevertheless, this enhanced turnover rate is partly compensated by a slight increase of the Km of this mutant, giving a 40 to 250% better relative efficiency over the wild-type enzyme. Such enhanced activity is very much similar to that found for the Chim16 and Chim21, both of which include the Y473F substitution (Table III), leading us to conclude that the Tyr to"

In the nucleus, Smads serve as transcription factors by directly binding to specific DNA sequences and regulating the expression of ligand-response genes. A previous structural analysis, at 2.8-Å resolution, revealed a novel DNA-binding mode for the Smad MH1 domain but did not allow accurate assignment of the fines features of protein-DNA interactions. The crystal structure of a Smad3 MH1 domain bound to a palindromic DNA sequence, determined at 2.4-Å resolution, reveals a surprisingly important role for water molecules. The asymmetric placement of the DNA-binding motif (a conserved 11-residue β-hairpin) in the major groove of DNA is buttressed by seven well ordered water molecules. These water molecules make specific hydrogen bonds to the DNA bases, the DNA phosphate backbones, and several critical Smad3 residues. In addition, the MH1 domain is found to contain a bound zinc atom using four invariant residues among Smad proteins, three cysteines and one histidine. Removal of the zinc atom results in compromised DNA binding activity. These results define the Smad MH1 domain as a zinc-coordinating module that exhibits unique DNA binding properties.

The receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) include Smad1, -2, -3, -5, and -8, each of which is involved in an agonist-specific signaling pathway. The Co-mediator Smad (Co-Smad), namely Smad4 in vertebrate, is an obligate partner for all R-Smads and participates in signaling by diverse TGF-β family members. Upon ligand activation, a specific R-Smad is phosphorylated by a corresponding receptor Ser/Thr kinase. The phosphorylated R-Smad is translocated into the nucleus and forms a functional signaling complex with Smad4 to modulate expression of the ligand-responsive genes. Essential to their function, both R-Smad and Smad4 exhibit sequence-specific DNA binding activity. The Smad proteins, about 400–500 amino acids in length, consist of highly conserved MH1 and MH2 domains. The MH2 domain is responsible for the formation of homomeric as well as heteromeric Smad complexes, whereas the MH1 domain exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding activity and negatively regulates the function of the MH2 domain. The DNA binding activity of the MH1 domain is central to Smad-mediated function (8Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 9Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Investigation on transcriptional activation by Smad proteins has revealed a complex pattern involving multiple proteins and diverse response promoter elements (10Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 12ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Using a PCR-based random-oligonucleotide selection process, an 8-bp palindromic DNA sequence, 5′-GTCTAGAT-3′, was identified as the Smad-binding element, or SBE (13Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Extensive DNA mutagenesis verified that this SBE indeed represents the optimal DNA-binding sequence for Smad3 and Smad4. The crystal structure of a Smad3 MH1 domain bound to a 16-bp DNA containing the SBE sequence was determined at 2.8-Å resolution (14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The Smad MH1 domain appeared to adopt a unique fold, with little resemblance to other known structures. In the MH1 domain, a protruding 11-residue β-hairpin was identified as a novel DNA-binding motif, which makes specific contacts to the DNA bases and the backbone phosphate groups in the major groove (14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). However, due to the relatively low resolution, the solvent molecules could not be explicitly considered for specific DNA contacts. Consequently, in the close vicinity of the base-contacting residues in the major groove, there was some electron density that could not be accounted for. To reveal the fine features of DNA binding by the Smad MH1 domain, we generated better crystals of a Smad3 MH1-DNA complex and solved its structure at 2.4-Å resolution (Table I). In the final refined model, water molecules were found to play an extremely important role, mediating a number of significant contacts between residues in MH1 and specific bases and phosphates in the SBE DNA. Compared with the low resolution structure, 17 more hydrogen bonds are now in place to buttress the specific recognition of the SBE by the MH1 domain. We also identified a bound zinc atom in the MH1 domain. Removal of zinc using EDTA leads to a compromised DNA binding activity. These results define the Smad MH1 domain as a zinc-coordinating module that exhibits unique DNA binding properties.Table IData collection and statistics from the crystallographic analysisData setNativeResolution (Å)99.0-2.4Total observations68,907Unique observations14,360Average I/σ (outer shell)33.7 (5.3)Data redundancy (-fold)4.8Data coverage (outer shell)95.9% (82.5%)Rsym (outer shell)0.051 (0.166)RefinementResolution range (Å)15-2.4Number of reflections (I > 2 σ)13,219Rworking/Rfree21.2%/27.0%Number of total atoms2726Number of waters47Number of zinc atoms2r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.005r.m.s.d. bond angles (degree)1.265Average B factorAll atomsProtein atomsAll water moleculesWater (bound to DNA)55.8556.2044.5634.98 Open table in a new tab Protein and DNA Preparation—Recombinant Smad3 MH1, corresponding to residues 1–145, was overexpressed and purified as described (14Shi Y.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The electron density for both the zinc atoms and the well ordered water molecules was excellent after preliminary refinement. A total of 47 water molecules were built into the atomic model over five cycles of refinement, each involving positional as well as individual B factor refinement. The final refined model contains two molecules of Smad3 MH1 (residues 7–132 and 9–132, respectively), a 15-bp DNA duplex, 47 well ordered water molecules, and two zinc atoms. Residues at the N and C termini have no electron density in the maps, and we presume that these regions are disordered in the crystals. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DNA-binding assays were performed as described previously (14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The SBE sequences used were 5′-GTATGTCT AGACTGAA-3′. The Smad MH1 domain contains a novel DNA-binding motif, an 11-residue β-hairpin embedded asymmetrically in the major groove of DNA. The crystals used in the previous study were of poor quality and small size; the native data set was derived from a total of seven small crystals as the crystals were extremely susceptible to radiation damage by the X-rays (14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Consequently, due to the relatively low resolution of 2.8 Å, the previously reported structure does not allow an accurate understanding of the fine features of interactions between DNA and the MH1 domain. There was also some electron density in the MH1 domain that could not be explicitly accounted for. To resolve these ambiguities, we tried to improve the diffraction limit by generating larger crystals. We screened a large number of additives and precipitants and were able to significantly improve crystals of the Smad3 MH1 domain (residues 1–145) bound to a 16-bp SBE sequence using 5 mm spermine as an optimal additive. The structure, determined on the basis of a single crystal, has been refined to a resolution of 2.4 Å (Table I and Fig. 1). The new structure allowed visualization of three additional DNA bases and four more residues in the MH1 domain. As anticipated, the overall structure is similar to that reported earlier (14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Each of the two MH1 molecules binds identically and independently to the major groove of a 4-bp Smad box, 5′-GTCT-3′ or 5′-AGAC-3′, making hydrogen bond contacts to the bases and to the phosphodiester backbones of the DNA (Fig. 1). The Smad3 MH1 domain adopts a compact globular fold, with four α-helices, six short β-strands, and five loops. The MH1 domain employs a β-hairpin, formed by strands B2 and B3, to contact DNA in the major groove. The β-hairpin, protruding outward from the globular MH1 core, is rigidly held in place by networks of hydrogen bonds both within itself and between itself and DNA (Figs. 1 and 2). Despite an overall similarity, the new structure exhibits two significant and prominent features that are absent in the reported structure (14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). A number of well ordered water molecules make extensive networks of hydrogen bonds to both residues in the β-hairpin and the DNA bases and phosphate backbones as well as among each other (Figs. 1B and 2). For each β-hairpin, the associated water molecules make hydrogen bonds to both strands of the DNA (Fig. 2). Supporting a critical role for these water molecules, the average temperature factor (B factor) is only 34.98 for the 14 water molecules that are bound to the β-hairpin and DNA (Table I and Fig. 1B). This value is lower than the average B factor for all solvent molecules, 44.56, or for all protein atoms, 56.20. These 14 solvent molecules, symmetrically located on the palindromic SBE, make a total of 28 hydrogen bonds to stabilize DNA recognition by the two Smad MH1 domains, with seven water molecules involved in DNA binding by one MH1 domain (Figs. 1B and 2). Among these seven water molecules, w6 and w2 make direct hydrogen bonds to the third and fourth bases of the 5′-GTCT-3′ sequence, respectively, whereas w1, w3, w5, and w7 hydrogen bond to the phosphate groups of the DNA backbone (Fig. 2 and Table II). The last water molecule w4 connects with w1, w5, and the side chain carboxylate of residue Asp72 through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2 and Table II).Table IIList of specific hydrogen bondsH-bond pairHydrogen bond distanceThis structure (at 2.4-Å resolution)Previously reported structure (at 2.8 Å)DNA base-specific contactsArg74 Nη1—G5 N72.87 (3.14)2.92 (3.29)Arg74 Nη2—G5 O62.73 (2.67)2.62 (2.75)Gln76Oϵ1—A8′ N62.98 (3.05)3.35 (2.94)Lys81 Nζ—G7′ O62.89 (3.06)n/aLys81 Nζ—A8′ N73.12 (2.90)3.01 (3.08)w2 O—T8 O42.68 (2.62)n/aw6 O—C7 N43.13 (2.90)n/aDNA phosphate contactsLeu71 N—G7′ O1P2.73 (2.89)3.15 (3.06)Gln76 N—A8′ O2P2.77 (3.06)2.94 (3.15)Ser78 N—T9′ O1P2.88 (2.95)3.13 (3.46)w3 O—T9′ O2P2.60 (2.46)n/aw1 O—A8′ O2P2.74 (2.75)n/aw5 O—G7′ O1P2.67 (2.45)n/aw7 O—T9′ O1P2.71 (2.57)n/aButtressing contactsSer37 Oγ—w3 O2.64 (3.24)n/aGln76 O—w3 O2.64 (2.69)n/aArg74 O—Ser70 Oγ2.60 (2.77)2.72 (2.76)Gly73 N—Ser70 O3.04 (3.07)2.79 (2.78)Asp72 Oδ1—w4 O2.64 (2.50)n/aGln76 N—w1 O3.15 (3.49)n/aw4 O—w1 O3.12 (2.78)n/aw4 O—w5 O2.69 (3.48)n/aGln76 Oϵ1—Lys81 Nζ2.41 (2.80)3.01 (2.82)Gln76 Nϵ2—w2 O2.92 (3.33)n/aw2 O—w6 O2.74 (2.68)n/aAsp72 Oδ2—Arg74 Nη23.06 (3.50)3.17 (3.55)Asp72 Oδ2—Arg74 Nϵ2.55 (3.19)2.89 (3.33)Ser78 O—w7 O2.52 (2.83)n/aGln76 Nϵ2—Ser78 O3.08 (2.68)n/a Open table in a new tab Although the overall DNA-binding mode in this structure is very similar to that reported in the 2.8-Å structure, there are significant differences. The unambiguous and important role of solvent molecules in DNA-binding was not characterized in the 2.8-Å structure. In addition, some residues in the β-hairpin that specifically recognize DNA bases did not appear to have an ideal conformation. For example, the distance between the Oϵ1 atom of Gln76 and the N6 atom of the base A8′ was 3.35 Å (14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar); in this 2.4 Å structure, the distance is refined to 2.98 Å (Table II), which is better suited for a hydrogen bond. More importantly, one additional base-specific hydrogen bond was identified between the Nζ atom of Lys81 and the O6 atom of the base G7′ (Fig. 2 and Table II). Another interesting structural feature is that the Smad3 MH1 domain coordinates a bound zinc atom, using three cysteine residues, Cys64, Cys109, and Cys121, and one histidine, His126. All four residues are invariant among members of the Smad family as well as their homologues in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting the conserved nature of zinc binding (Fig. 3A). This zinc atom is deeply buried in the MH1 structure; even the four coordinating residues are completely solvent inaccessible (Fig. 3B). These observations demonstrate that zinc plays a structural role here and is likely bound with a high affinity. To assess the role of zinc in the function of the MH1 domain, we used the chelating agent EDTA to remove the zinc ion in the Smad3 MH1 domain and examined the DNA-binding ability of the resulting protein (Fig. 3C). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled SBE sequence. In contrast to the untreated Smad3-MH1 domain, the EDTA-treated protein exhibited a significantly lower binding affinity for SBE (Fig. 3C). Solvent molecules may play an indispensable role in mediating specific DNA recognition by transcriptions factors, as exemplified by the Trp repressor (18Shakked Z. Guzikevich-Guerstein G. Frolow F. Rabinovich D. Joachimiak A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 368: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Joachimiak A. Haran T.E. Sigler P.B.

Nature. 1988; 335: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). However, the previous crystal structure of the Smad3-MH1 bound to DNA, at 2.8-Å resolution, did not allow accurate assignment of water molecules. To resolve these ambiguities, we produced crystals of higher quality using the additive spermine. The current structure has been refined at 2.4-Å resolution using a native data set derived from a single crystal. The electron density unambiguously identified a number of important water molecules at the Smad MH1-DNA interface (Figs. 1 and 2). These water molecules contribute significantly to DNA recognition by mediating a number of important contacts between DNA and the MH1 domain (Table II). Smad proteins are transcriptional factors and signal through regulation of ligand-responsive genes. Except Smad2, R-Smads and Smad4 all bind to DNA in a sequence-dependent manner (7Shi Y. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is important to note that, based on both structural evidence (Ref. 14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar and this study) and published literature (8Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 9Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the minimal Smad binding sequence comprises only 4 base pairs, 5′-GTCT-3′ or 5′-AGAC-3′. Although the sequence 5′-GTCT-3′ was initially identified to be the optimal binding element for Smad3 and Smad4 (13Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), the conserved nature of the DNA-binding hairpin as well as its surrounding sequence elements among R-Smads strongly suggests that other R-Smads should specifically bind to the same sequence as well. The relatively low specificity of DNA binding by Smads has engendered tremendous difficulty in the identification of biologically relevant Smad-responsive DNA elements as well as the interpretation of such results. This challenge is further confounded by the highly positively charged helix H2 of the MH1 domain, which resides next to the DNA-binding β-hairpin in the crystal structure (Fig. 1A). This helix has been identified as the nuclear localization sequence for Smad3 and Smad1 (21Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Xiao Z. Watson N. Rodriguez C. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Bioessays. 2001; 23: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Clusters of lysine residues generally prefer G/C-rich sequences (23Choo Y. Klug A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Indeed, while Smad3 and Smad1 were shown to bind specifically to the sequence 5′-GTCT-3′ (13Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S.

Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), which is likely due to the H2 helix. At present, there is no conclusive evidence to indicate that the H2 helix can bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. In a recent sequence and structure-based analysis, the MH1 domain was found to exhibit some homology to the zinc-binding protein I-PpoI, a member of the diverse His-Me finger endonuclease family (27Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since the zinc-coordinating residues in I-PpoI are conserved in the MH1 domain, it was postulated that the Smad MH domain might also contain a zinc atom (27Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This prediction is now confirmed by our 2.4-Å resolution structure of the Smad3 MH1 bound to DNA, which shows a zinc atom coordinated by three cysteine and one histidine residues. Interestingly, the previous electron density map at 2.8-Å resolution did not contain significant density at the position of the zinc atom (14Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). More importantly, chemical analysis of the Smad3 MH1 domain used in the previous study did not reveal the presence of the zinc atoms (data not shown). Nevertheless, removing zinc has a negative impact on the DNA-binding ability of the Smad3 MH1 domain. This finding has practical implications for the study of Smad-DNA interactions in vitro. At present, most published gel shift experiments on Smad proteins involve the use of chelating agents such as EDTA. As shown in this study (Fig. 3C), this could complicate the interpretation of results."

From the intestine of an eel, we identified cDNAs encoding three distinct guanylin-like peptides. Based on the sequence of mature peptide and sites of production, we named them guanylin, uroguanylin, and renoguanylin. Renoguanylin is a novel peptide that possesses the characteristics of both guanylin and uroguanylin and was abundantly expressed in the kidney. By immunohistochemistry, guanylin was localized exclusively in goblet cells, but not enterochromaffin cells, of the intestine. After transfer of eels from fresh water to seawater, mRNA expression of guanylin and uroguanylin did not change for 3 h, but it increased after 24 h. The increase was profound (2–6-fold) after adaptation to seawater. The expression of uroguanylin was also up-regulated in the kidney of seawater-adapted eels, but that of renoguanylin was not so prominent as other guanylins in both intestine and kidney. Collectively, the novel eel guanylin family appears to have important functions for seawater adaptation, particularly long-term adaptation.

The major function of guanylin is regulation of water and electrolytes (particularly Cl–) transport of the intestine, but uroguanylin also participates in renal handling of water and electrolytes (1Forte L.R.

London R.M. Eber S.L. Freeman R.H. Krause W.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1724Google Scholar), reptiles (9Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Eber S.L. Hamra F.K. Currie M.G. Forte L.R. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1997; 107: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and birds (10Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Eber S.L. Hamra F.K. Fok K.F. Currie M.G. Forte L.R. Acta Anat. 1995; 153: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Only in the European eel, Anguilla anguilla, a single guanylin-like peptide, has thus far been molecularly identified (11Comrie M.M. Cutler C.P. Cramb G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because of an aquatic life, fish provide unique opportunities for studies of body fluid regulation. When fish are in fresh water (FW), they suffer from an excess water load and salt loss that occurs across the gills. In seawater (SW), however, they face hypernatremia and hypovolemia (12Evans D.H. Evans D.H. The Physiology of Fish. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 315-341Google Scholar). Accordingly, euryhaline fish that readily adapt to both media are able to reverse salt and water regulation when they move from FW to SW or vice versa. The intestine plays a pivotal role in this reversal. The intestine serves simply as a route of nutritional absorption when fish are in FW; however, it is subjected to dramatic morphological and biochemical (transporter molecules, etc.) changes during the course of SW adaptation and becomes a sole site of water uptake from the environment when fish are in SW (13Hirano T. Morisawa M. Ando M. Utida S. Robinson J.W.L. Intestinal Ion Transport. Medical and Technical Publishing Co., Lancaster, UK1976: 301-317Crossref Google Scholar, 14Cutler C.P. Cramb G. Hohmann S. Nielsen S. Water Transport and Aquaporin Expression in Fish in Molecular Biology and Physiology of Water and Solute Transport. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2000: 433-441Google Scholar). Therefore, if the orally ingested water is not allowed to enter the intestine by esophageal ligation, fish in SW die in a few days from hypovolemia and hypernatremia (15Takei Y. Tsuchida T. Tanakadate A. Zool. Sci. 1998; 15: 677-682Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because relative importance of the intestine changes so dramatically according to the environmental salinity, the intestine of euryhaline fish serves as a good model to analyze the role of osmoregulatory hormone such as guanylins. The eel is a highly euryhaline species from which extensive data on its osmoregulation have been accumulated (16Rankin J.C. Davenport J.A. Animal Osmoregulation. Brackie, Glasgow, Scotland1981: 201Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the buccal and intestinal epithelia of eels can sense Cl–, which results in the regulation of drinking and intestinal absorption of water and NaCl (17Hirano T. J. Exp. Biol. 1974; 61: 737-747PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ando M. Nagashima K. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 711-716PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus likely that some humoral factors are released in response to changes in luminal Cl– concentration to regulate these osmoregulatory processes. Atrial natriuretic peptide, a member of the natriuretic peptide family that utilizes cGMP as an intracellular messenger, like guanylin, is a possible candidate for the mediator because it potently inhibits drinking and intestinal NaCl absorption in eels (19Tsuchida T. Takei Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1605-R1610PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ando M. Kondo K. Takei Y. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1992; 162: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Loretz C.A. Takei Y. Fish Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 17: 319-324Crossref Google Scholar). However, the amount of atrial natriuretic peptide stored in the eel intestine appears to be too small to be the major humoral mediator released from the intestine (22Loretz C.A. Pollina C. Kaiya H. Sakaguchi H. Takei Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, guanylins are more likely candidates as, in mammals, uroguanylin is shown to be secreted into the circulation and serves as an “intestinal natriuretic factor” mediating information transfer from the intestine to the kidney (1Forte L.R.

From a single eel, we isolated three distinct clones of guanylin-like peptides, which were named eel guanylin, uroguanylin, and renoguanylin. All three clones share the characteristics of guanylin peptides in terms of structure (two disulfide bonds) and tissue distribution (intestine and/or kidney). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of eel guanylin and uroguanylin was upregulated in the intestine and/or kidney during the course of adaptation to SW. Thus, we report here the presence of a novel guanylin family in the eel and further suggest that the eel guanylin family is likely to be intestinal paracrine/autocrine factors and/or endocrine hormones that are involved in adaptation of eels to hyperosmotic SW environment. Animals—Cultured immature eels (A. japonica) were purchased from a local dealer. They were maintained in FW or SW without feeding for at least 2 weeks before use, which were named FW or SW eels, respectively. FW eels and SW eels weighed 184 ± 13 g (n = 34) and 169 ± 8 g (n = 9), respectively. Water in the tank was continuously circulated, aerated, and regulated at 18 °C. RNA Extraction—After anesthesia in 0.1% (w/v) tricaine methanesulfonate (Sigma), the brain, gill, heart, liver, esophagus, stomach, anterior intestine, posterior intestine, kidney, head kidney, and spleen were isolated from eels and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. These organs include major tissues of guanylin/uroguanylin/lymphoguanylin expression in mammals (1Forte L.R. London R.M. Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Annu. Rev.

The anterior and posterior intestines were separated at the clearly recognizable sphincter located distally. Total RNA was extracted using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). cDNA Cloning—Poly(A)+ RNA was separated from total RNA of the posterior intestine of one SW eel using Oligotex-dT30 (Japan Synthetic Rubber, Tokyo, Japan). The cDNA pool was prepared from 0.5 μg Poly(A)+ RNA using SMART cDNA Library Construction kit (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The partial cDNAs of three guanylin-like peptides (GLP-1, -2, and -3) were cloned by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method using CDS III/3′ primer and a designed sense primer: GUA-S1 or GUA-S7 (Table I). Amplification by PCR was performed using Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) at the following schedule: 94 °C for 30 s, then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, and finally 72 °C for 7 min. After 3′-RACE, 5′-RACE was performed using 5′ PCR primer and gene specific primers (GUA-A1 for GLP-1, GUA-A8 for GLP-2, and GUA-A3 for GLP-3) (Table I) on the same schedule except for annealing temperature (55 °C for GLP-1 and 3, and 65 °C for GLP-2). Finally, the full coding region was amplified using CDS III/3′ primer and specific primers designed from the 5′-untranslated sequences: GUA-S2 for GLP-1, GUA-S8 for GLP-2, and GUA-S4 for GLP-3 (Table I). To increase the fidelity, the final amplification was performed with Advantage 2 DNA Polymerase Mix (Clontech) from non-amplified first strand cDNA. All amplified products were subcloned into pT7blue vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and sequenced in a 310 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table ISequences of primers for cDNA cloning and tissue distributionNameSequenceGUA-S15′-ATCTGCGCTAATGCTGCCTGCAC-3′GUA-S25′-AGACGAAGAGCGATCCCTCCAC-3′GUA-S45′-ACAGGAAGACAAGACACAAAGC-3′GUA-S75′-GATCCATGTGTGAAATCTGCGCTAA-3′GUA-S85′-CAGCAGGACGAGCCGTGATC-3′GAPDH-S15′-CATTGGTCGCCTGGTCCTCA-3′GUA-A15′-TAACTGAGAGAATACAGAAACGCAG-3′GUA-A35′-GGAGGGTGTGACAGTCAGTCA-3′GUA-A85′-GCATCCAGTGCAGGCAGCATT-3′GUA-A105′-TTAGCTTTGTCCTTTGCAGTCTG-3′GAPDH-A15′-ATGCCCGTCAGCTTCCCGTT-3′ Open table in a new tab Tissue Distribution—Tissue distribution of the three GLP mRNAs was determined by RT-PCR according to the previously described method (27Takei Y. Inoue K. Ando K. Ihara T. Katafuchi T. Kashiwagi M. Hirose S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R1727-R1735Google Scholar). Total RNAs isolated from the tissues (5 μg each) were reverse-transcribed with Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using specific primers: GUA-S2 and GUA-A1 for GLP-1, GUA-S8 and GUA-A10 for GLP-2, and GUA-S4 and GUA-A3 for GLP-3 (Table I). To minimize the variation in amplification efficiency among the sequences, these specific primers were designed to adjust Tm values and target length (475, 438, and 419 bp for GLP-1, -2, and -3, respectively, which were visually distinguishable by length after electrophoresis). As an internal control, eel glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (GenBank™ accession number AB049458) was used. The PCR condition was as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, then 22 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 63 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1.5 min, and finally 72 °C for 7 min. The number of cycles for GLP-2 was increased to 26 because of its low level of expression. Amplified products were electrophoresed and detected after staining with ethidium bromide (EtBr). No signal was detected from the negative control without reverse-transcriptase. Effects of Environmental Salinity on mRNA Expression—GLP mRNA levels were compared between FW and SW eels in the osmoregulatory organs (intestine, kidney, and esophagus) and the liver. FW and SW eels (n = 6 in each case) were used to compare the expression after long-term adaptation (2 weeks) in each osmotic media. To examine the role of GLPs in short-term adaptation to SW, changes in the mRNA levels were examined in the intestine 0, 3, and 24 h after transfer of FW eels to SW (SW, 3 and 24 h) or to FW (time controls: FW, 0, 3, and 24 h) (n = 5–7 in each case). RT-PCR was performed to examine the GLP expression level as the same conditions of tissue distribution except for PCR cycles (30 cycles) in uroguanylin of the anterior intestine. To test the reliability of this method, serially diluted template cDNAs (0.008–0.512 μg) from the anterior intestine of a SW eel were amplified, and their signals were measured. It was demonstrated that the signal intensity was linear in this range over the dilution factor of 60 (data not shown). The current PCR conditions were designed carefully to make signals within the linear-range. The abundance of GLP mRNAs was shown as percentage to that of GAPDH mRNA in the experiment to examine long-term adaptation. In the short-term experiment, however, the expression of both eel GAPDH and β-actin (GenBank™ accession number AB074846) increased in the intestine after SW transfer (see “Results”). Therefore, we did not normalize the values with those of GAPDH or β-actin as discussed under “Discussion.” After electrophoresis and staining with EtBr, signal intensity was measured with an automatic image analyzer (FLA-2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). For statistical analyses, Student's t test was applied except for highly variable cases where Mann-Whitney's U test was applied. Significance was determined at p < 0.05. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. Immunohistochemistry—Predicted mature peptides in the C terminus of GLP-1 (15 amino acid residues) and GLP-2 and 3 (16 amino acid residues) were synthesized by Peptide Institute Inc. (Minoh, Osaka, Japan). The two disulfide bonds were correctly formed, and two topological stereoisomers produced were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (28Schulz A. Marx U.C. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Rösch P. Forssmann W-G. Adermann K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Antisera were raised in two rabbits against synthetic GLP-1 conjugated to keyhole lympet hemocyanin. An antiserum for serotonin used to identify enterochromaffin cells was kindly provided by Dr. Ryogo Yui of Zenyaku Kogyo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan (29Yui R. Shimada M. Fujita T. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 260: 193-201Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antisera for GLP-1 was tested by dot blot analysis using 1–100 pmol of synthetic GLP-1, -2, and -3. The blotted membranes were preincubated in 0.05% Tween 20 in 10 mm PBS (pH 7.2) and incubated with the antiserum diluted to 500-, 1000-, and 3000-folds with 10 mm PBS for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing in 10 mm PBS (pH 7.2), the membranes were stained by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA). The specificity of the antiserum for serotonin was described in previous studies (29Yui R. Shimada M. Fujita T. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 260: 193-201Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Yui R. Nagata Y. Fujita T. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1988; 51: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The anterior intestine of SW eels was fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in 10 mm PBS (pH 7.4) for 24 h at 4 °C, soaked in 30% sucrose in 10 mm PBS overnight, and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at –20 °C. Cryosections were cut at 20 μm and collected onto gelatincoated slides. The sections were incubated sequentially with: 1) 2% normal goat serum (NGS) for2hat room temperature, 2) the antiserum for GLP-1 diluted at 1:1000 with 10 mm PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% keyhole lympet hemocyanin, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2% NGS, and 0.02% sodium azide, or the antiserum for serotonin diluted at 1:15000 with the same buffer for 40 h at 4 °C, 3) goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) diluted at 1:200 for GLP-1 and 1:300 for serotonin with 10 mm PBS (pH 7.4) containing 2% NGS for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were observed under a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). cDNA Cloning—Three distinct cDNA clones encoding GLPs were amplified from the RNA extracted from the posterior intestine of a single SW eel (Fig. 1). In each cDNA, two variants were consistently observed in similar numbers among more than 10 clones sequenced. The two variants differ at 3 positions (2 coding and 1 non-coding) in GLP-1, 3 positions (3 non-coding) in GLP-2, and 6 positions (2 coding and 4 non-coding) in GLP-3. The nucleotide replacement in coding regions altered one amino acid in the prosegments of GLP-1 and GLP-3, respectively (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequences of prepro-GLPs exhibited low sequence identity (25–43%) to mammalian guanylin and uroguanylin, except for the restricted sequences in the prosegment (at amino acid positions 32–41) and the putative mature sequences at the C terminus (Fig. 2). The amino acid replacement did not occur in the conserved regions between the two variants.Fig. 2Comparison of precursor sequences of eel guanylin (GN), uroguanylin (UGN), and renoguanylin (RGN) with those of mammalian GN, UGN, and lymphoguanylin (LGN).

Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Comparing the potential mature sequences at the C terminus, GLP-1 and -3 had an aromatic amino acid (phenylalanine) at position 9 as in mammalian guanylins (tyrosine or phenylalanine), whereas GLP-2 had asparagine as in mammalian uroguanylin (Fig. 3). GLP-1 sequence ended with a cysteine residue as in all mammalian guanylins thus far identified, whereas GLP-2 and -3 had an additional residue (leucine) at the C terminus as did some mammalian uroguanylins (leucine or serine) (Fig. 3). Based on the sequence characteristics and sites of mRNA expression (see below), we named GLP-1 eel guanylin and GLP-2 eel uroguanylin (Fig. 1). GLP-3 was a novel peptide that shared the structural characteristics of both guanylin and uroguanylin. Because the expression of GLP-3 in the kidney relative to the intestine was more abundant than uroguanylin (see below), we named the new peptide “renoguanylin” (Fig. 1). Tissue Distribution—The RT-PCR applied to various eel tissues showed that eel guanylin was expressed only in the intestine, and no expression was detectable in other tissues including the alimentary tract (stomach and esophagus) (Fig. 4). Eel uroguanylin was expressed in the kidney, liver, and esophagus as well as the intestine (Fig. 4). However, because the overall expression of uroguanylin was low, four more PCR cycles were required to intensify the signal to the level of guanylin and renoguanylin. Eel renoguanylin was abundantly expressed in the kidney in addition to the intestine (Fig. 4). Its expression in the kidney relative to the intestine was much greater than that of uroguanylin. Judging from the result of dilution experiment, the negative tissues produced less than 1/100 of mRNA compared with the intestine (data not shown). Cellular Localization of Guanylin in Eel Intestine—The dot blot analysis revealed that the antiserum for eel guanylin has only a weak cross-reactivity with eel renoguanylin (less than 1/20) and has no cross-reactivity with eel uroguanylin (data not shown). In the intestine of SW eels, guanylin immunoreactivity was localized exclusively in some goblet cells (Fig. 5A). The signal was distributed ubiquitously in the cytoplasm but was absent in the mucus of the goblet cells. In some mammalian species, positive guanylin signals were reported in the enterochromaffin cells (33Cetin Y. Kuhn M. Kulaksiz H. Adermann K. Bargsten G. Grube D. Forssmann W-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2935-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, no immunoreactive guanylin was identified in the enterochromaffin cells that were identified by the presence of serotonin immunoreactivity (Fig. 5B) (29Yui R. Shimada M. Fujita T. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 260: 193-201Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Comparison of Expression of Guanylins between FW and SW Eels—The mRNA expression of guanylin and uroguanylin was profoundly up-regulated in both anterior and posterior intestine of SW eels, but that of renoguanylin was enhanced only in the anterior intestine (Figs. 6, 7, 8). The up-regulation was more profound in the anterior intestine than in the posterior intestine of SW eels. In the kidney, the mRNA expression of uroguanylin, but not of renoguanylin, was up-regulated in SW eels (Figs. 7 and 8). The expression level of uroguanylin in the liver and esophagus was not different between FW and SW eels (Fig. 7, D and E).Fig. 7Expression of eel uroguanylin in anterior intestine (A), posterior intestine (B), kidney (C), esophagus (D), and liver (E) in freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) eels (2 weeks, n = 6 each).

However, the expression of renoguanylin did not change for 24 h (Fig. 9, IIIA). Similar results were obtained in the posterior intestine (Fig. 9B) except for the increase of uroguanylin after 3 h (Fig. 9, IIB). Although there was no difference in GAPDH expression in the intestine between FW- and SW-adapted eels (Figs. 6, 7, 8), the expression increased for 24 h after transfer of FW eels to SW (Fig. 10, I). We examined another housekeeping gene, β-actin, but its expression was also enhanced after SW transfer (Fig. 10, II). This may be due to the dramatic morphological changes that occur during the early phase of SW adaptation (34Yamamoto M. Hirano T. Cell Tissue Res. 1978; 192: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because specific changes in the expression of guanylins should be calculated independently of such hypertrophic and hyperplastic changes that accompany the expression of housekeeping genes, we showed the expression"

Ara-C-induced DNA damage caused rapid sympathetic neuronal death that was associated with an increase of c-jun expression. In addition, c-Jun was phosphorylated in its N-terminal transactivation domain, which is important for c-Jun-mediated gene transcription. Blocking c-Jun activation by JNK pathway inhibition prevented neuronal death after stress. In contrast, neither the JNK inhibitor SP600125 nor the mixed lineage kinase inhibitor CEP-1347 prevented cytosine arabinoside-induced neuronal death, demonstrating that the JNK pathway was not necessary for DNA damage-induced neuronal apoptosis. Surprisingly, SP600125 or CEP-1347 could not block c-Jun induction or phosphorylation after DNA damage. Pharmacological inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity completely prevented c-Jun phosphorylation after DNA damage. These results demonstrate that c-Jun activation during DNA damage-induced neuronal apoptosis was independent of the classical JNK pathway and was mediated by a novel c-Jun kinase.

Cells experience DNA damage caused by several environmental stresses such as UV irradiation and oxidative stress. When DNA damage is no longer reparable, various cell death pathways are activated before mitosis to prevent the delivery of damaged DNA to offspring. Thus, many chemotherapy regimens are based on DNA-damaging agents. However, DNA damage can also kill postmitotic cells such as neurons. Central nervous system neurotoxicity is a major dose-limiting factor in high dose ara-C treatment for refractory leukemias (1Winkelman M.D. Hines J.D. Ann.

Freeman R.S. Johnson Jr., E.M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The default pathway is similar to the programmed cell death of neurons upon withdrawal of their trophic factor, nerve growth factor (NGF). 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DIV, days in vitro; JNK, Jun-N-terminal kinase; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; MAPK, MAP kinase; MLK, mixed lineage kinase; MEK kinase, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ara-C, cytosine arabinoside. 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DIV, days in vitro; JNK, Jun-N-terminal kinase; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; MAPK, MAP kinase; MLK, mixed lineage kinase; MEK kinase, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ara-C, cytosine arabinoside. This pathway kills neurons rapidly and requires the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bax. Ara-C exposure leads to Bax-mediated mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation. The second pathway is only observed in the absence of Bax. Activation of cell death in Bax-null neurons is significantly delayed and proceeds with a protracted time course compared with wild type neurons. This slower death is similar to the delayed death observed in camptothecin-treated embryonic cortical neurons in the presence of caspase inhibitors or after Bax deletion (11Stefanis L. Park D.S.

Moreover, hippocampal neurons carrying a mutant c-Jun gene (JunAA) that lacks the two critical N-terminal phosphorylation sites show increased resistance to kainate exposure (20Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun is phosphorylated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). JNK is part of a three-sequential kinase signaling cascade (22Mielke K. Herdegen T.

MAP kinase kinase (MKK) activates JNK by dual Tyr and Thr phosphorylation. MKK activation is mediated by MAP kinase kinase kinases, including the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family in neurons. Selective inhibition of the MLK family in sympathetic neurons by the K252a analog, CEP-1347, demonstrates that MLKs mediate JNK activation after trophic factor deprivation, UV irradiation, and oxidative stress (24Maroney A.C.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 103-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the changes in c-Jun and JNK pathway activity in sympathetic neurons during DNA damage-induced apoptosis. DNA damage caused c-Jun activation in neurons by two separate mechanisms: induction of c-Jun expression and N-terminal c-Jun phosphorylation. Surprisingly, DNA damage-induced c-Jun expression and phosphorylation were maintained in the absence of neuronal JNK activity. In addition, the JNK pathway was not necessary for DNA damage-induced apoptosis because pharmacological inhibition of the JNK pathway by CEP-1347 or SP600125 did not increase neuronal survival. These results demonstrate that DNA damage-induced neuronal c-Jun activation was independent of the classical JNK pathway. c-Jun activation was blocked by several structurally distinct pharmacological CDK inhibitors, suggesting that a CDK-like activity may be responsible for mediating c-Jun activation and neuronal death after DNA damage. Animals and Materials—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Animal use and treatment complied fully with the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University and the United States Animal Welfare Act (1985). Collagenase and trypsin were purchased from Worthington. Mouse 2.5S NGF was from Harlan Bioproducts (Indianapolis, IN). The goat anti-mouse 2.5 S NGF neutralizing antiserum has been characterized previously (27Ruit K.G. Elliott J.L. Osborne P.A. Yan Q. Snider W.D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 573-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). CEP-1347 was a kind gift of Cephalon (Westchester, PA). SP600125 was provided by Celgene Inc., San Diego, CA. Etoposide and olomoucine were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Alsterpaullone was obtained from Calbiochem. Neuronal Culture—Primary sympathetic neuronal cultures were prepared from P0 to P1 rat superior cervical ganglia by using methods described previously (28Johnson M.I. Argiro V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Briefly, superior cervical ganglia were dissected from newborn animals and incubated for 30 min each with 1 mg/ml collagenase and 2.5 mg/ml trypsin at 37 °C. The ganglia were dissociated by triturating with a P200 micropipet tip; cells were plated on collagen-coated plastic tissue culture plates at appropriate densities. Cultures were maintained in AM50 medium (90% minimum essential medium (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF, 20 μm fluorodeoxyuridine, 20 μm uridine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin), supplemented with 3.3 μg/ml aphidicolin (AG Scientific, Inc., San Diego, CA) for the first 5 days in vitro (DIV) to reduce the number of non-neuronal cells. To deprive neurons of NGF, 5-day-old neuronal cultures were washed three times with AM0 (AM50 medium lacking NGF) and fed with fresh AM0 containing 0.01% anti-NGF antiserum. For the treatment of neurons with various DNA-damaging agents, the culture medium was replaced with fresh AM50 containing the indicated concentrations of the particular DNA toxin. In neuronal cultures used to harvest protein, 25–50 μm of broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, bocaspartyl-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA), was included in all treatment conditions to inhibit neuronal death. Neuronal Survival—The number of viable cells was assessed after fixing the cultures with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher) in phosphate-buffered saline and staining with crystal violet. Neurons were scored as viable by a naïve observer if the crystal violet-positive cells had large, well defined cellular outlines. Dead neurons and debris stain faintly or show no staining with crystal violet. Percentage viability was calculated by dividing the number of crystal violet-positive neurons at each time point by the total number of neurons in NGF-maintained, untreated sister cultures. Immunocytochemistry—Cultures were fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.9% NaCl), and incubated in blocking solution (5% normal goat serum in TBS, containing 0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. The cultures were then incubated with primary antibodies in antibody solution (1% normal goat serum in TBS, containing 0.3% Triton X-100) overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: phospho-c-Jun (Ser63 II) (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and active caspase-3 (1:250, Promega, Madison, WI). The cultures were next washed three times with TBS and incubated in antibody solution containing Cy-3-labeled secondary antibodies (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 4 h at 4 °C and counterstained with 1 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After four washes with TBS, the cultures were mounted for fluorescence microscopy. Western Blot Analysis—Neuronal cultures were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in reducing sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol), boiled for 5 min, and stored at –20 °C until use. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on Tris glycine mini-gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked for1hat room temperature with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution recommended by manufacturer. The following primary antibodies were used: c-Jun (0.25 μg/ml, Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), c-Jun (1:1000, Cell Signaling), phospho-c-Jun (Ser63 II) (1:1000, Cell Signaling), phospho-c-Jun (Ser73) (1:1000, Cell Signaling), phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (1:1000, Cell Signaling), phospho—SEK1/MKK4 (Thr261) (1:1000, Cell Signaling), and tubulin (Clone DM 1A, 1:50,000, Sigma). After washing, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) diluted 1:2500–1:10,000 in blocking solution. The blots were washed 3 times with TBST and developed with a chemiluminescent substrate (Supersignal, Pierce). To strip and reprobe blots, the membranes were incubated in 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) twice for 25 min and then washed with TBST. The Western analysis was then repeated. To semiquantitate immunoblots, the films were digitally scanned into Adobe Photoshop, and the selected bands were subjected to pixel analysis by using the UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). All values were normalized using the values obtained for tubulin loading control. c-Jun Expression Is Induced in Neuronal Apoptosis after DNA Damage—We have reported previously that ara-C kills sympathetic neurons in vitro (8Martin D.P. Wallace T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 184-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wallace T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 115-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study (7Geller H.M. Cheng K.Y. Goldsmith N.K. Romero A.A. Zhang A.L. Morris E.J. Grandison L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) has shown that ara-C causes oxidative stress in embryonic cortical neurons and leads to DNA damage and cell death. We determined whether this DNA damage can activate proapoptotic signals in sympathetic neurons. Several lines of evidence suggest that c-Jun has an essential role in neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, we examined the expression of c-Jun during DNA damage-induced neuronal apoptosis. In sympathetic neurons, ara-C exposure caused an increase in the levels of c-Jun protein (Fig. 1). This increase was apparent at 24 h, thus preceding the loss of viability (8Martin D.P. Wallace T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 184-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increased levels of c-Jun protein remained heightened throughout the period of ara-C exposure. After 48 h of ara-C treatment, the migration of neuronal c-Jun became slower in SDS-PAGE, suggesting that c-Jun may have been phosphorylated during cell death. c-Jun Is Phosphorylated in Its N-terminal Transactivation Domain after DNA Damage—One of the most critical steps in c-Jun regulation involves phosphorylation of two specific serine residues, Ser63 and Ser73, located in the N-terminal transactivation domain. Phosphorylation of Ser63 and Ser73 enhances c-Jun-mediated gene transcription (30Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To determine whether neuronal c-Jun is subject to posttranslational modification after DNA damage, we examined the potential c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation using an antibody that specifically detects c-Jun only when Ser63 is phosphorylated. When sympathetic neurons were exposed to increasing concentrations of ara-C, neuronal c-Jun was phosphorylated beginning at 11.1 μm of ara-C, and the levels of phospho-c-Jun were augmented with increasing ara-C concentrations (Fig. 2A). This concentration dependence correlated well with the dose-response curve of ara-C killing in sympathetic neurons (8Martin D.P. Wallace T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 184-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, neurons exposed to ara-C showed increased levels of phospho-c-Jun over time (Fig. 2B). Because ara-C exposure induced c-Jun expression and N-terminal phosphorylation simultaneously, increased phosphorylation after DNA damage might have been an indirect effect of elevated neuronal c-Jun levels. Therefore, we measured the relative ratio of phosphorylated c-Jun to total c-Jun during ara-C-induced neuronal apoptosis (Fig. 2C). The phospho-c-Jun/c-Jun ratio increased by 3-fold after 48 h of ara-C exposure, thus demonstrating that N-terminal c-Jun phosphorylation was not an indirect effect of increased protein levels. Localization of phospho-c-Jun by immunocytochemistry demonstrated that activated c-Jun was exclusively nuclear during DNA damage-induced neuronal apoptosis (Fig. 2D). About 50% of sympathetic neurons lose their viability after 48 h of ara-C exposure, and most neurons are dead by 96 h (67Besirli C.G. Deckwerth T.L. Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. Johnson Jr., E.M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the time course of N-terminal c-Jun phosphorylation preceded the time course of ara-C-induced sympathetic neuronal death because the number of phospho-c-Jun-positive neurons started to increase at 24 h, at which time all neurons are still alive, and continued until 48 h with 70% of neurons containing nuclear phospho-c-Jun (Fig. 2E). Phosphorylation of Ser73, located in the N-terminal transactivation domain, is also critical for increasing c-Jun-mediated transcription. Similar to Ser63, DNA damage induced by ara-C treatment also led to increased levels of Ser73-phosphorylated c-Jun in sympathetic neurons (Fig. 2F). These results demonstrate that c-Jun was activated by N-terminal phosphorylation after DNA damage. In addition, the time course of c-Jun activation is consistent with increased c-Jun activity being a critical step in neuronal cell death after DNA damage (Fig. 2E). Neuronal c-Jun Activation Is a Common Stress Response Seen after DNA Damage—Besides causing DNA damage, ara-C can also affect several other metabolic events in neurons, including the synthesis of membrane lipids and glycoproteins, potentially influencing the intracellular levels of lipid second messengers (10Wallace T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 115-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Jun induction and N-terminal phosphorylation occurred as a specific response to DNA damage after ara-C exposure, we examined the effects of other DNA-damaging agents in sympathetic neurons. Etoposide is a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor that damages DNA by generating double-stranded DNA breaks. Sympathetic neurons exposed to 10 μm etoposide exhibited a significant increase in c-Jun levels starting at 6 h (Fig. 3A). This increase was associated with rapid neuronal death (data not shown). Etoposide-induced c-Jun protein also migrated more slowly in SDS-PAGE, indicating post-translational modification by increased phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis of neuronal phospho-c-Jun levels showed that etoposide-induced DNA damage also caused enhanced N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser63 and Ser73 (Fig. 3, B and C). We also exposed sympathetic neurons to another nucleoside analog, ara-A. Similar to ara-C, ara-A interferes with DNA metabolism, but it does not share other DNA-independent metabolic actions of ara-C. Ara-A-induced sympathetic neuronal death was also associated with c-Jun activation, as shown by increased phospho-c-Jun Ser63 levels in neuronal nuclei after 96 h of treatment (Fig. 3D). Compared with ara-C and etoposide, ara-A-induced N-terminal c-Jun phosphorylation was delayed. However, this delay was consistent with the time course of ara-A-induced neuronal death, which was also considerably delayed compared with ara-C-induced death. 2C. G. Besirli and E. M. Johnson, Jr., unpublished observations. Induction and phosphorylation of c-Jun after both etoposide and ara-A-induced DNA damage indicate that our initial observation of ara-C-induced c-Jun activation was caused by neuronal DNA damage. Topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin also kills sympathetic neurons. Compared with ara-C and etoposide, death of sympathetic neurons after camptothecin exposure shows a slower time course (50% death at 72 h (31Park D.S. Morris E.J. Greene L.A. Geller H.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1256-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), data not shown). Surprisingly, camptothecin exposure did not lead to the phosphorylation of c-Jun in sympathetic neurons (Fig. 3E). Therefore, c-Jun activation was a common event during neuronal death induced by multiple, but not all, DNA-damaging agents. DNA Damage-induced c-Jun Induction and Phosphorylation Are Primarily Mediated by a JNK-independent Signaling Pathway—Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal transactivation domain is believed to be performed exclusively by JNKs after cellular stress (13Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 22Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog.

This JNK-mediated N-terminal phosphorylation is critical for the transcriptional activity of c-Jun (30Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Neuronal c-Jun phosphorylation induced by ara-C and other DNA-damaging agents suggests that the JNK pathway was activated during DNA-damage-induced neuronal apoptosis. During neuronal cell death caused by trophic factor deprivation, UV irradiation, or oxidative stress, MLKs mediate phosphorylation-coupled JNK activation by stimulating JNK-kinase MKK4/7 (24Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Bozyczko-Coyne D. O'Kane T.M. Neff N.T. Tolkovsky A.M. Park D.S. Yan C.Y. Troy C.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1901-1912PubMed Google Scholar, 32Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MKKs and JNKs is required for catalytic activity of these kinases. Therefore, activation of the JNK pathway can be indirectly examined by analyzing the levels of phosphorylated kinases, as increased phosphorylation is coupled to increased catalytic activity. We determined the levels of phospho-MKK4 in sympathetic neurons by using an antibody that specifically recognizes Thr261-phosphorylated MKK4, which is important for kinase activity. Although we did not detect any significant increase above basal levels after DNA damage at 12 h (Fig. 4A), our data indicated that there might be a slight increase in phospho-MKK4 levels in ara-C-treated neurons at 24 and 36 h. However, quantitative data showed that there was no significant difference in phospho-MKK4 levels between NGF-maintained and ara-C-treated neurons at these time points (Fig. 4B). In contrast, NGF-deprived neurons, in which the JNK pathway is activated, showed significantly higher phospho-MKK4 levels compared with NGF-maintained, untreated neurons (Fig. 4A). Similar to phospho-MKK4, we did not detect any increase in the amount of phospho-JNKs after ara-C treatment (Fig. 4C). Indeed, the amount of phospho-JNK declined during DNA damage-induced neuronal death, because sympathetic neurons showed high basal levels of JNK phosphorylation when maintained in NGF. These results suggest that activity of the JNK pathway was not increased by DNA damage and, in fact, was decreased and that JNKs did not mediate c-Jun phosphorylation. However, MKK7 might have been the JNK kinase activated after DNA damage, and phospho-MKK4 antibody might not have detected phosphorylated MKK7 in neurons. In addition, even though the total phospho-JNK levels were decreased in ara-C-exposed sympathetic neurons, a subset of JNKs might have been activated by DNA damage, as the JNK family consists of 3 isoforms and 10 splice variants. The detection of this potential isoform-specific JNK activation with a pan-phospho-JNK antibody may not be possible. Therefore, we determined whether JNK pathway activation was responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation in DNA-damaged neurons by assessing the effect of pharmacological JNK pathway inhibition on c-Jun activation. CEP-1347 is a selective MLK inhibitor that prevents JNK activity and neuronal apoptosis (15Harris C.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Biol.

When we treated sympathetic neurons with ara-C in the presence of 1.3 μm CEP-1347, the majority of N-terminal c-Jun phosphorylation was maintained (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, N-terminal c-Jun phosphorylation induced by NGF deprivation was completely prevented in sibling neuronal cultures (Fig. 5, A and B), demonstrating that CEP-1347 fully prevented MLK-dependent activation of JNKs in neurons as reported previously (26Harris C.A. Deshmukh M. Tsui-Pierchala B. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 103-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 5c-Jun induction and phosphorylation during DNA damage-induced neuronal death is independent of the classical JNK pathway. 5-DIV sympathetic neurons were exposed to 100 μm ara-C, deprived of NGF, or left untreated and were fixed after 48 h. In some neuronal cultures, ara-C treatment or NGF deprivation was performed in the presence of 1.3 μm CEP-1347 (CEP) or 14 μm SP600125 (SP). N-terminal c-Jun phosphorylation was examined by the detection of neuronal phospho-c-Jun Ser63 immunocytochemically. Concurrent staining with bisbenzimide was performed to detect the nuclei of neurons. Neither MLK-inhibitor CEP-1347 (A and B) nor JNK-inhibitor SP600125 (C and D) blocked the majority of c-Jun phosphorylation after ara-C-induced DNA damage. Mean ± S.D., n = 3–4.

https://openalex.org/W1982110986,"When co-expressed with receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) can function as a receptor for both calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM). To investigate the structural determinants of ligand binding specificity, we examined the extracellular domain of human (h) RAMP1 using various deletion mutants. Co-expression of the hRAMP1 mutants with hCRLR in HEK-293 cells revealed that deletion of residues 91–94, 96–100, or 101–103 blocked [125I]CGRP binding and completely abolished intracellular cAMP accumulation normally elicited by CGRP or AM. On the other hand, the deletion of residues 78–80 or 88–90 significantly attenuated only AM-evoked responses. In all of these cases, the receptor heterodimers were fully expressed at the cell surface. Substituting alanine for residues 91–103 one at a time had little effect on CGRP-induced responses, indicating that although this segment is essential for high affinity agonist binding to the receptors, none of the residues directly interacts with either CGRP or AM. This finding suggests that RAMPs probably determine ligand specificity by contributing to the structure of the ligand-binding pocket or by allosteric modulation of the conformation of the receptor. Interestingly, the L94A mutant up-regulated surface expression of the receptor heterodimer to a greater degree than wild-type hRAMP1, thereby increasing CGRP binding and signaling. L94A also significantly increased cell surface expression of the hRAMP1 deletion mutant D101–103 when co-transfected with hCRLR, and expression of a L94A/D101–103 double mutant markedly attenuated the activity of endogenous RAMP1 in HEK-293T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092259583,"Biophysical techniques such as size-exclusion chromatography, sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis are the classical methods for determining the self-association of molecules into dimers, trimers, or other higher order species.

The detection of molecular self-association and aggregation is an important concern for molecules intended for biological applications, such as proteins, peptides, and small organic drug molecules. A plethora of biophysical techniques already exist for the detection of molecular self-association in aqueous solution, including spectroscopic (NMR, CD, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), fluorescence, light scattering), chromatographic (affinity, size-exclusion (SEC) 1The abbreviations used are: SEC, size exclusion chromatography; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; lin, linear. 1The abbreviations used are: SEC, size exclusion chromatography; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; lin, linear./gel filtration), and other techniques (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), non-denaturing PAGE, sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation). However, some of the classical techniques commonly used for measuring self-association (sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, non-denaturing PAGE, and size-exclusion chromatography) possess a lower limit to the molecular size that can be clearly resolved, such that fewer methods exist for detecting self-association in smaller molecules. With a view to solving this problem, we describe here a novel method for measuring self-association, referred to as “temperature profiling in reversed-phase chromatography,” based on observation of the conformation-dependent response of peptides to RP-HPLC under changing temperature.Much of the efficacy of RP-HPLC as a probe of polypeptide stability, folding, and conformation lies in the extensive range of stationary phases and/or mobile phase conditions available to the researcher when relating polypeptide elution behavior with structural features (e.g. the amphipathicity of α-helices or cyclic β-sheet peptides; destabilization of conformation) (1Mant C.T.

Such studies are based on the premise that the hydrophobic interactions between polypeptides and the nonpolar stationary phase characteristic of RP-HPLC (15Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S.

We believe temperature adds another dimension to such applications, with physicochemical studies of RP-HPLC of polypeptide solutes under conditions of varying temperature (hence, “temperature profiling”) allowing even more insight into conformational stability and self-association of peptide solutes.The present study demonstrates the utility of temperature profiling in RP-HPLC to monitor self-association of small cyclic peptides based on the de novo-designed amphipathic cytolytic peptide, GS14, through the interpretation of peptide elution behavior over a temperature range of 5–80 °C. This approach is shown to be simple to operate, highly sensitive, requires low sample quantities (nanograms to low micrograms) and is capable of analyzing small molecules (<2000 Da). In addition, the applicability of this novel approach for other small molecules is also discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSPeptide Synthesis, Purification, and Cyclization—Linear and cyclic peptides were synthesized using standard t-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry, as described previously (17Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25261-25268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). N-terminal and C-terminal groups of linear peptides were left as free amino and carboxyl groups, respectively. Peptides were cleaved using standard HF protocol and purified by reversed-phase chromatography. Peptides intended for cyclization were cyclized, deformylated, and purified using the method of Kondejewski et al. (17Kondejewski L.H. Farmer S.W. Wishart D.S. Kay C.M. Hancock R.E. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25261-25268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Analytical Reversed-phase Analysis of Peptides—Peptides were analyzed on an Agilent 1100 Series liquid chromatograph (Little Falls, DE). Runs were performed on a Zorbax 300SB-C8 column (2.1 mm (inner diameter) × 150 mm, 300-Å pore size, 5-μm particle size) from Agilent Technologies using a linear AB gradient (0.5% B/min) and a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min, where solvent A is 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2 and solvent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Analyses were performed in 5 °C increments, from 5 to 80 °C.CD Spectroscopy—CD measurements were obtained on a JASCO J-810 Spectropolarimeter at 20 °C (Easton, MD) using Spectra Manager 228 software, Version 1.10.00 running on a Pentium III under Microsoft Windows 2000 (Redmond, WA). Temperature was controlled in a Lauda Model RMS-6 water bath (Brinkman Instruments, Rexdale, Canada). Peptide concentrations used in this study were ∼30 μm as determined by amino acid analysis or UV absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ = 2840 cm–1m–1 from two d-Tyr residues) of stock solutions. Data were collected at 0.1-nm intervals from 190 to 250 nm for wavelength scans at 20 °C, with the average of 4 or 8 scans reported. Benign buffer (i.e. nondenaturing to peptide structure) was 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Scans were also performed in 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5 containing 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol. Ellipticity was reported as mean residue molar ellipticity ([θ]) in deg·cm2·dmol–1 using Equation 1, [θ]=θ(MRW)/10lc (Eq. 1) where θ is the ellipticity in millidegrees, MRW is the mean residue weight (molecular weight divided by number of residues), l is the optical path length of the cell in centimeters, and c is the peptide concentration in mg/ml. Alternatively, for ease of use, the equation can be rearranged to Equation 2, [θ]=θ/10lcMn (Eq. 2) where θ is the ellipticity in millidegrees, l is the optical path length of the cell in centimeters, cM is the peptide concentration in mol/liter, and n is the number of residues in the peptide. This form allows direct entry of ellipticity (in millidegrees) and concentration (in molarity) values obtained experimentally, without requiring the mean residue weight calculation.Curve Fitting—Temperature profiling data were fit to either a first-order nonlinear least-squares equation, a fourth-order polynomial, or a smooth fit using Kaleidagraph v. 3.52 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Transition temperature values (Tp) were defined as the temperatures at which the maximum retention times were experimentally observed, i.e. in 5 °C-increments, and were not determined by maxima obtained from fitted curves. If more accurate data are required, we recommend that the analysis be performed in 3 °C increments from 5 to 80 °C if sample quantity and run time are not limiting factors.RESULTSPeptide Design and RP-HPLC Retention BehaviorParent Peptide (GS14)—GS14 is a 14-residue cytolytic amphipathic peptide designed de novo in our laboratory (Fig. 1).

It is a cyclic β-sheet molecule that contains six aliphatic residues (3 Val and 3 Leu) on the nonpolar face and four basic (Lys) residues on the polar face; the segregation of nonpolar and charged residues on opposite sides of the molecule makes it an extremely amphipathic peptide (Fig. 2A) (27McInnes C.

GS14 is also a suitable choice for de novo peptide design and structure-activity studies because the cyclic nature of the peptide prevents amino acid substitutions from significantly altering secondary structure, i.e. switching the β-sheet to an α-helix or random coil. Previous studies indicated that GS14 aggregated above 50 μm peptide concentration in aqueous solution (26Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Prenner E.J. Kondejewski L.H. Kay C.M. McElhaney R.N. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 58: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, attempts to determine the oligomerization state failed by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (because of the low molecular weight) and by size-exclusion chromatography (because of high sample load requirements and low peptide solubility), thus emphasizing the need for an alternative technique to examine self-association of this molecule. GS14 is biologically active against human red blood cells (hemolytic); however, it shows little or no antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeast (17Kondejewski L.H.

Thus, peptides containing such preferred binding domains will exhibit significantly greater retention times compared with analogs with the same amino acid composition (i.e. the same intrinsic hydrophobicity) but lacking such a domain (8Mant C.T.

Due to the intimate interaction of the nonpolar faces of amphipathic cyclic analogs with a reversed-phase matrix, any differences in effective hydrophobicity of these preferred binding domains via amino acid substitutions in this domain will be readily monitored through subsequent differences in RP-HPLC retention time behavior.Peptide Diastereomer (GS14K4)—Because GS14 has such low specificity toward microbial membranes, analogs of GS14 have been studied in an attempt to reverse this activity profile and to create an antimicrobial peptide with minimal toxicity to human cells and high activity toward pathogens. One such analog is GS14K4 (Fig. 2B), a diastereomer of GS14 with the d-enantiomer of l-Lys substituted at position 4 (9Kondejewski L.H. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Farmer S.W. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D.

While the positively charged l-Lys 4 in GS14 is normally on the polar face, the d-Lys 4 in GS14K4 is positioned on the nonpolar face and disrupts the β-sheet structure in benign medium. GS14K4 exhibits an activity profile opposite to that of GS14 with a 103- to 104-fold improvement in therapeutic index (a measure of peptide specificity for microbial cells over human cells). Since the highly hydrophilic d-Lys is positioned on the nonpolar face of the peptide, the amphipathicity of the molecule is significantly decreased, thus decreasing its retention time in RP-HPLC relative to GS14 by over 23 min at 80 °C (GS14, 85.6 min; GS14K4, 62.0 min, Table I). A comparison of the effect of temperature on the elution behavior of GS14 and GS14K4 is shown in Fig. 3. While GS14 aggregates at concentrations above 50 μm (84 μg/ml) in solution due to the high hydrophobicity of its nonpolar face, no aggregation was observed in GS14K4 up to the highest concentration studied, 175 μm (292 μg/ml) (26Jelokhani-Niaraki M.

Because GS14 and GS14K4 possess the ability to be analyzed in an RP-HPLC system and exhibit marked differences in activity, structure, and aggregation phenomena, these de novo-designed cyclic peptides are ideal candidates for the investigation of relationships between molecular self-association and biological activity using the RP-HPLC technique of temperature profiling.Table IHPLC data for peptides used in this studyPeptidetR(80 °C)aPeptide retention time at 80 °C as determined by reversed-phase HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”).tR(5 °C)bPeptide retention time at 5 °C as determined by reversed-phase HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”).TPcTemperature at which the maximum retention time is observed over the temperature range 5-80 °C.tR(TP)dPeptide retention time at temperature TP.tR(TP)-tR(5 °C)eDifference in retention time between tR at the TP and tR at 5 °C.tR(TP)-tR(80 °C)fDifference in retention time between tR at the TP and tR at 80 °C.minmin°CminminminGS1485.682.55586.74.21.1GS14XD4 analogsGS14 LD4100.496.855101.85.01.4GS14 FD498.394.855100.05.21.7GS14 AD494.190.65595.34.71.2GS14 YD483.083.24085.11.92.1GS14 ND473.373.54075.31.82.0GS14 KD4gGS14KD4 and GS14K4 denote the same peptide with D-Lys at position 4.62.065.02065.30.33.3GS14K4 hydrophobicity analogsGS14K462.065.02065.30.33.3GS14K4 V3/A347.452.5552.505.1GS14K4 L3/A339.846.4546.406.6GS14K4 A625.833.3533.307.5Linear analogsGS14 lin55.662.81563.10.37.2GS14K4 lin46.251.6551.605.4GS14K4 A6 lin21.330.7530.709.4a Peptide retention time at 80 °C as determined by reversed-phase HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”).b Peptide retention time at 5 °C as determined by reversed-phase HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”).c Temperature at which the maximum retention time is observed over the temperature range 5-80 °C.d Peptide retention time at temperature TP.e Difference in retention time between tR at the TP and tR at 5 °C.f Difference in retention time between tR at the TP and tR at 80 °C.g GS14KD4 and GS14K4 denote the same peptide with D-Lys at position 4.

The analogs also had a lower net charge versus GS14K4 (+3 instead of +4 from the Lys residues in GS14, Fig. 2). The differences in the peptide composition influenced peptide retention time in RP-HPLC, with the most hydrophobic amino acid substitution (d-Leu in GS14LD4) producing the largest retention time, compared with GS14K4, which had the least hydrophobic amino acid (d-Lys) at position 4 and the lowest retention time within the series. Retention times at 80 °C ranged from 62 to 100 min for d-Lys and d-Leu peptides, respectively (Table I).GS14K4 Hydrophobicity Analogs—To investigate the role of peptide hydrophobicity in microbial specificity, analogs of GS14K4 were previously created with variations of the aliphatic residues in the nonpolar face (24Kondejewski L.H."

Holliday junctions, which are X-shaped DNA structures, are formed at the stalled replication forks and can accumulate if they are not cleaved by structure-specific endonucleases. Recently, a novel nuclease involved in resolving Holliday junction-like structures, Mus81, has been reported in yeast and humans. MUS81 has sequence homology to another DNA nuclease, XPF, which, with its partner ERCC1, makes the 5 ′ incision during nucleotide excision repair. MUS81 also has a binding partner named Mms4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Eme1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but no such partner was identified in human cells. Here, we report identification of the binding partner of human MUS81, which we designate hMMS4. Using immunoaffinity purification we show that hMUS81 or hMMS4 alone have no detectable nuclease activity, but that the hMUS81 ·hMMS4 complex is a structure-specific nuclease that is capable of resolving fork structures.

It is important for any dividing cell to ensure the integrity and fidelity of the genome. To accomplish this goal, all cellular events have to be processed orderly and properly. Checkpoint pathways monitor the sequence of these cellular processes as well as the quality of these biochemical events (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). The DNA replication, or S phase, checkpoint is one of the checkpoint pathways that helps to maintain the fidelity of cell division by monitoring the completion of the DNA replication. The S phase checkpoint ensures the re-assembly and recovery of broken replication forks and ensures activation of replication origins in an orderly manner. Replication forks may stall when they reach a replication block, for example a DNA damage, or when the nucleotide pools are insufficient for elongation (3Kim S.M. Huberman J.A. EMBO. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). A broken replication fork leads to specific DNA structures including Holliday junctions. In response to DNA damage or DNA replication blocks, both checkpoint and recombinational DNA repair pathways are activated to resolve the Holliday junction-like structures and promote fork re-assembly (5Cox M.M. Mutat. Res. 2002; 510: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Rhind N. Russel P. Curr.

Despite some differences between yeast and mammalian cells, the major components of this protein network appear to be the same. Mus81 was initially identified by two independent yeast-two hybrid screens with S. cerevisiae Rad54 (7Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Mol. Gen.

Chk2, defined as a transducer protein in the checkpoint signal transduction pathway, is a Ser/Thr protein kinase (9Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Incomplete replication is monitored by checkpoint damage sensor proteins, which either activate Chk2 and ensure a reversible S phase arrest or activate both Chk1 and Chk2 to establish a G2/M arrest (13Chatuvedi P.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast indicate that Rad53, budding yeast homolog of Chk2, is required for the stalled replication fork recovery (14Foiani M. Pellicioli A. Lopes M. Lucca C. Ferrari M. Liberi G. Muzi Falconi M. Plevani P. Mutat. Research. 2000; 451: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that the S phase checkpoint activates the recombinational repair machinery instead of indirectly allowing repair by inhibiting replication (6Rhind N. Russel P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10 (-R911): R908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rad54, a double-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase, works together with the Rad52 epistatic group proteins in the recombinational repair of double-strand DNA breaks (15Mazin A.V. Alexeev A.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14029-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The properties of these two Mus81-interacting proteins, Chk2 and Rad54, strongly suggest that MUS81 plays a role in the S phase recovery pathway.MUS81 has high homology to the XPF family of nucleases (16Brookman K.W.

The XPF protein forms a stable heterodimer with its binding partner, ERCC1, and this complex is required for the 5′ nuclease activity during nucleotide excision repair (19Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

There were no biochemical data that the human MUS81 preparation contained hMMS4, and standard data base searches failed to reveal a human ortholog (24Chen X.B. Melchionna R. Denis C.M. Gaillard P.H.

Furthermore, we show that although hMUS81 has no nuclease activity on its own, the protein, which we designate hMMS4, forms a heterodimer with hMUS81, and this hMUS81-hMMS4 heterodimer has a structure-specific endonuclease activity. We conclude that the newly identified human protein is a functional homolog of yeast Mms4/Eme1, which confers specific endonuclease activity to hMUS81.MATERIALS AND METHODSDNA Constructs—hMUS81/pCR2.1 was kindly provided by JANSSEN Research Foundation, Beerse, Belgium (24Chen X.B.

The hMUS81 cDNA was amplified with Pfu Turbo enzyme (Stratagene) from this plasmid by using primers 5′-GCAACAGGATCCAGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG GCGGCCCGGTCG-3′ and 5′-CTAGCTCGAGGGTCAAGGGGCCGTAGCTGCA-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into pcDNA4/myc-HisA vector (Invitrogen).The results of PSI-PHI BLAST and 3D-PSSM (three-dimensional position-specific scoring matrix) searches using SpEme1 and ScMms4 sequences against the human genome data base showed that the IMAGE clone MGC: 9497 was a statistically significant candidate. The open reading frame of the putative human MMS4 gene was amplified from pCMV.SPORT6-MMS4 plasmid (Invitrogen), which contains the IMAGE clone MGC: 9497, using primers 5′-GCAACAAAGCTTAGCCACCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGCTCTAAAGACATCACCCTCACTG-3′ and 5′-CTTTAGCCGCTCGAGTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGTCAGCA CTATCTAAAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XhoI enzymes and then inserted into pcDNA4/myc-HisA vector to obtain the N-terminal HA 1The abbreviation used is: HA, hemagglutinin.-tagged and C-terminal His-tagged hMMS4 expression vector pcDNA4-HA-hMMS4-His. Both the N- and C-terminal tags were obtained from the PCR primers. The C-terminal primer encodes for a His tag and a stop codon at the end. PCR-generated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill DNA Sequencing Facility). The control plasmid used for immunoprecipitation experiments, FLAG-hCRY1-myc/His, has been described previously (26Özgür S. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2926-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).DNA Substrates—DNA substrates were prepared from HPLC-purified 50-mer DNA oligos (OPERON Technologies) as Oligo 1, 5′-GACGCTGCCGAATTCTGGCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACGTTGACCCG-3′; Oligo 2, 5′-GCGATAGTCTCTAGACAGCATGTCCTAGCAAGCCAGAATTCGGCA GCGTC-3′; and Oligo 3, CGGGTCAACGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAG CAAGCCAGAATTCGGCAGCGTC. The underlined nucleotides in Oligo 2 are complementary to those in the Oligo 1. The single-stranded DNA was made by labeling and purifying Oligo 1. The double-stranded DNA was made by annealing labeled Oligo 1 with Oligo 3. The Y structure was made by annealing Oligo 1 with Oligo 2. Oligo1 (1 pmol) was labeled at the 5′ terminus using 1 mCi [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, 7000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Following kinase inactivation, the labeled Oligo 1 was gel-purified on 10% denaturing gel and annealed with an excess of cold Oligo 4. Then, double-stranded 50-mers were gel-purified from a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel.Cell Culture, Expression of Recombinant Proteins, and Immunoprecipitation—The SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney 293 (293T) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin/ml. 4 × 106 293T cells were plated on 150 cm2 plates 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with either pcDNA4-FLAG-hMUS81-His or pcDNA4-HA-hMMS4-His mammalian expressions vectors or both of these vectors (15 μg plasmid DNA each) using the calcium-phosphate precipitation protocol (27Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). After 10 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, fresh medium was added to the cells, and incubation was continued for a further 36–48 h. Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then were harvested and pelleted. The pellet was lysed using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 20 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged and the supernatant was bound to 15 μl of washed and activated either HA (Roche Applied Science) or FLAG (Sigma) resin. The resin was washed and activated prior to use according to the manufacturer's protocol. The lysates were incubated with the beads rocking at 4 C° for 6–10 h. Then, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and three times with 1 ml of nuclease buffer, which is described below. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were performed by transferring proteins to Highbond ECL nitrocellulose papers (Amersham Biosciences) using a semi-dry electroblotter. For immunoblotting, His (sc-803)-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used followed by antirabbit secondary antibody (Promega) and alkaline phosphotase color development assay (Promega).Endonuclease Assay—The endonuclase assay was performed using hMUS81, hMMS4, or hMUS81-hMMS4 immunoprecipitates. After washing FLAG and HA immunoprecipitates three times with lysis buffer followed by three times with nuclease buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm MgCl2) (24Chen X.B. Melchionna R. Denis C.M. Gaillard P.H. Blasina A. van de Weyer I. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Vialard J. McGowan C.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1117-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and they were incubated with radio-labeled Y structure DNA substrate (1 nm) in 30 μl reaction volume for 1 h at 30 °C, unless otherwise indicated. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μg proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) plus 10% SDS with incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The products were analyzed on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the level of incision was quantified by Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant software.RESULTSIdentification of a Putative Human Mms4/Eme1 Partner of hMUS81 by Bioinformatic Approaches—There is limited amino acid sequence homology between the two MMS4 homologs in budding and fission yeast (Fig. 1), and standard search methods did not uncover any obvious human homolog of either one. Therefore, we decided to use more advanced bioinformatic tools that are based on comparison searches of three-dimensional structures, such as PSI-PHI BLAST, to identify the human homolog. After performing five iterated profile searches of human data base using the query sequence fission yeast Eme1, we found that IMAGE clone MGC: 9497, had an e-value better than threshold in several consecutive rounds (Supplemental Table I). To further confirm this, we also performed a 3D-PSSM search, which scans the secondary structure prediction of query sequence fission yeast Eme1 against a representative secondary structure fold library. One of the highest scoring structural matches was again the human IMAGE clone MGC: 9497, with 17.9%, whereas the budding yeast homolog scored 18.7% against the fission yeast. We concentrated our efforts on IMAGE clone MGC: 9497 and not the clone BAB71047.1, which also has high scores (Supplemental Table I), because despite a high degree of sequence identity of the two clones, BAB71047.1 has a deletion of 13 amino acids in the middle of the open reading frame. Therefore, we decided to determine whether the MGC: 9497 encoded protein possessed Mms4/Eme1-like function. For simplicity, we will refer to the IMAGE clone MGC: 9497 as hMMS4. The gene encodes a protein of 583 amino acids with no obvious sequence motifs.MUS81 Binds to MMS4 Specifically to Form a Complex— The first step in ascertaining whether MMS4 encodes the human binding partner of MUS81 was to express both MUS81 and MMS4 proteins in mammalian cells to determine whether they interact. Human 293T cells were transfected both with FLAG-MUS81-His and HA-MMS4-His vectors alone and together. After transfection of 293T cells, cell lysates were prepared and Western blotting was performed using His antibodies. In Fig. 2, lanes 1–4 show cell lysates and expression levels of each protein, and lanes 5–8 show the results of the immunoprecipitation using FLAG beads. Although HA-MMS4-His was expressed at the same levels in both lanes 2 and 3, only in lane 7 were both hMMS4 and hMUS81 proteins present, indicating that hMMS4 interacts with the FLAG-MUS81 protein but not with the negative control FLAG-CRY1 in lane 6. These results were confirmed by performing the reciprocal immunoprecipitation assay. Immunoprecipitation of hMMS4 pulled down hMUS81 showing that the interaction we detected is specific (Fig. 3A). In lanes 1–3 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using HA resin and in lanes 4–6 they were immunoprecipitated with FLAG resin. Lanes 2 and 4 were used as negative controls for nuclease assay using HA and FLAG resins, respectively. In lanes 1 and 5, HA-MMS4 and FLAG-MUS81 proteins were expressed and immunoprecipitated on their own. In lanes 3 and 6, hMUS81 and hMMS4 were expressed together and pulled-down with either HA or FLAG resins. These results demonstrate that hMMS4 is a binding partner for hMUS81 protein.Fig. 2Results of co-immunoprecipitation of MMS4 with MUS81. 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-CRY1-His (lane 1), FLAG-CRY1-His and HA-MMS4-His (lane 2), FLAG-MUS81-His (lane 3), and FLAG-MUS81-His and HA-MMS4-His (lane 4) plasmids. Cell lysates were prepared and bound to FLAG beads and analyzed by immunoblotting. Western blot was performed using His antibody as all proteins were His-tagged at the carboxyl-terminus. The expression levels of each protein are shown in lanes 1–4 as Input. The proteins bound to the FLAG beads were shown in lanes 5–8 as Bound.

In lanes 1, 4, and 13, single-stranded (ss), double-stranded (ds), and Y DNA substrates were incubated with the nuclease buffer, respectively. The reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C, and the DNA was resolved on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.

We used Y-structure substrates for our nuclease assays because such a structure is typically used for detecting nuclease activity of structure-specific nucleases such as FEN1 and XPF-ERCC1 (28Samson T.

Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The results of the nuclease assay are shown in Fig. 3B. The immunoprecipitates of hMUS81 and hMMS4 or the complex have only minor nonspecific nuclease activity on either single-stranded DNA (lanes 1–3) or double-stranded DNA (lanes 4–6). Immunoprecipitates of the individual proteins also failed to cleave the Y-structure specifically (lanes 7 and 11). In contrast, immunoprecipitates that contained both hMus81 and hMMS4 incised the Y-structure at the junction of single-stranded DNA to double-stranded DNA specifically (lanes 9 and 12). These results show that hMMS4 not only binds to hMUS81, but also forms a functional complex that incises Y-shaped DNA structure in a specific manner common to this family of nucleases.Because a previous report (24Chen X.B. Melchionna R. Denis C.M. Gaillard P.H. Blasina A. van de Weyer I. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Vialard J. McGowan C.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1117-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) indicated that hMUS81 immunoprecipitates had junction cutting activity, we performed a kinetic assay to detect any low level of activity that might have been missed in Fig. 3B. HA-immunoprecipitated MUS81 · MMS4 complex was used because HA resin immunoprecipitates resulted in better complex formation and higher nuclease activity (Fig. 3C). In Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4, DNA substrate and/or FLAG- and HA-immunoprecipitated cell lysates were incubated for 60 min. HA-immunoprecipitated MUS81 ·MMS4 protein complex was incubated for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min (lanes 5–8). As seen in Fig. 4A (lanes 5–8), only the MUS81 ·MMS4 complex cuts the DNA specifically. Quantitative analysis of this data (Fig. 4B) shows that MUS81 alone had less than 5% of the nuclease activity of MUS81 ·MMS4 complex. Thus, we conclude that the MUS81 ·MMS4 complex is the functional form of MUS81 resolvase.Fig. 4A, kinetic analysis of MUS81-MMS4 nuclease activity. Auto-radiogram of the assay gel is shown. FLAG-immunoprecipitated HA-MMS4 and HA-immunoprecipitated FLAG-MUS81 cell lysates were incubated with the DNA substrate for 60 min at 30 °C as controls and shown in lane 2 and 3.

We show that hMMS4 is necessary for the nuclease activity of hMUS81 on the Y structure DNA substrates. Therefore, we suggest that human MUS81 has a binding partner, hMMS4, which is necessary for its nuclease activity. We do not observe any significant nuclease activity using only recombinant hMUS81 protein made in human cells. This may be a consequence of not having enough endogenous hMMS4 to complex with the overexpressed hMUS81 protein in mammalian cells. However, when we coexpressed both components of the complex, the nuclease activity was readily detectable (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 6). Therefore, our results demonstrate that human MMS4 is not only the binding partner of hMUS81 but is also necessary for the Y structure-specific nuclease activity. In addition, we observed a difference between the levels of nuclease activity in the complex using HA and FLAG resin to immunoprecipitate the proteins (Fig. 3C). This difference was the result of different amounts of the proteins present in the complexes in the HA- and FLAG-immunoprecipitation used for these experiments (Fig. 3A). In a previous study (24Chen X.B. Melchionna R. Denis C.M. Gaillard P.H. Blasina A. van de Weyer I. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Vialard J. McGowan C.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1117-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), it was reported that immunoprecipitated hMUS81 protein alone had specific nuclease activity. In that study hMUS81 protein was obtained from stable cell lines, and it is possible that under those conditions the MUS81 ·MMS4 complex was immunoprecipitated. Our data indicates that hMUS81 does not appear to have intrinsic structure-specific nuclease activity. Although further studies are needed to resolve the cause of the discrepancy between the two studies, our results, along with the known biochemical properties of this family of nucleases (17Aravind L.

It is important for any dividing cell to ensure the integrity and fidelity of the genome. To accomplish this goal, all cellular events have to be processed orderly and properly. Checkpoint pathways monitor the sequence of these cellular processes as well as the quality of these biochemical events (1Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). The DNA replication, or S phase, checkpoint is one of the checkpoint pathways that helps to maintain the fidelity of cell division by monitoring the completion of the DNA replication. The S phase checkpoint ensures the re-assembly and recovery of broken replication forks and ensures activation of replication origins in an orderly manner. Replication forks may stall when they reach a replication block, for example a DNA damage, or when the nucleotide pools are insufficient for elongation (3Kim S.M. Huberman J.A. EMBO. 2001; 20: 6115-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M.

In response to DNA damage or DNA replication blocks, both checkpoint and recombinational DNA repair pathways are activated to resolve the Holliday junction-like structures and promote fork re-assembly (5Cox M.M.

Although largely distributed in vertebrates, the absence of KRAB motif-containing proteins and TIF1 family members in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests a late evolutionary apparition and expansion of these two protein families (8Moosmann P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, results obtained with these various approaches led to conflicting conclusions. For instance, in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggested that TIF1α and KAP-1 can homo-oligomerize (14Peng H. Feldman I. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) although no such homophilic interaction was detectable in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays (8Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Conversely, whereas heteromerization of TIF1α with KAP-1 was evidenced by yeast two-hybrid methods (5Venturini L. You J. Stadler M. Galien R. Lallemand V. Koken M.H. Mattei M.G. Ganser A. Chambon P. Losson R. de The H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it was not detected using in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation approaches (14Peng H. Feldman I. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The analysis of the interactions involving TIF1 family members is further complicated when considering that the transcriptional activities of TIF1 and KRAB-containing proteins drastically differ between yeast, where these proteins are not normally expressed, and mammalian cells. In contrast to what is found in mammalian cells, TIF1α, KAP-1, nor KRAB domain-containing proteins have transcriptional repressor activity in yeast (8Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) with the consequence that many functionally relevant interactions may not be found in this system (2Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In one case, a physiologically more appropriate transcription-based mammalian two-hybrid system has been successfully used to demonstrate the interaction of a non-repressive KAP-1 fragment with the KRAB domain of KRAZ1 and KRAZ2 (10Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, such assay cannot be used with full-length proteins that have intrinsic transcriptional activity, significantly limiting its usefulness. Although co-immunoprecipitation could alleviate this problem, this approach has the inherent drawback of possibly revealing complexes established during or following cell lysis. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation could not be readily used with proteins tightly bound to the nuclear matrix such as the KRAB-containing proteins that are resistant to solubilization in non-denaturating detergents. Taken together, the above considerations stress the need for the development of new approaches to study protein-protein interactions involving transcriptional regulators and/or nuclear matrix proteins. Fluorescence and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET or BRET) have recently been used to assess protein-protein interactions in living cells (20Eidne K.A. Kroeger K.M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Boute N. Jockers R. Issad T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 351-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In particular, BRET was successfully used to study homomerization of the Kai transcription factors, in the nuclear-less bacterial cell Escherichia coli (22Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and the oligomerization of the membrane-bound G protein-coupled membrane receptors in mammalian cells (23Angers S.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Here, using nuclear and nuclear-matrix targeting sequences as controls, BRET was used for the first time to quantitatively study protein interactions in the nuclear compartments of living mammalian cells. We report that two TIF1 family members, TIF1α and KAP-1, can form homo- and hetero-oligomers in intact mammalian cells and that KAP-1, unlike TIF1α, interacts with the KRAB multifinger protein ZNF74 in the nuclear matrix. In addition to providing new insights into the molecular interactions involved in the transcriptional activities of the TIF1 and KRAB-containing proteins, our study demonstrates that BRET can advantageously be used as a non-transcription-based detection system to study the interactions of full-length transcriptional regulators, including nuclear matrix proteins, in living cells.

For BRET constructs, all ZNF74 sequences were subcloned as XbaI fragments into the pHR-LUC C1 and pGFP10 C3 XbaI sites at the COOH terminus of luciferase and GFP (pHRLUC C1 ΔXhoI/BamHI blunted, pGFP10 C3 ΔSacI/BamHI blunted). pMal-c vector (New England Biolabs) was used to bacterially express maltose-binding protein (MBP) in-fusion with ZNF74 proteins as previously described (27Grondin B.

PCR-derived regions as well as blunted cloning regions were sequenced in all constructs. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (32Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transient transfections of plasmids were performed the following day by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transient transfections with Rluc and/or GFP10 fusion or other constructs were performed in 293T as described above. The total amount of DNA used for transfection was adjusted to 10 μg by adding pGEM4 vector (Promega). Forty-two hours post-transfection (or 48 h for transfections including TIF1α constructs), cells were detached with 2 mm phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA and washed twice with 1 mm phosphate-buffered saline/glucose. Cells were resuspended in 1 mm phosphate-buffered saline/glucose at ∼2 × 106 cells/ml and 90 μl (∼20 μg) were distributed in 96-well microplates (white Optiplate from Packard). Upon the addition of 5 μm of the cell permeant luciferase substrate, coelenterazine deep blue (10 μl) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the bioluminescence resulting from its degradation (emission peak 400 nm) was detected using a 370–450-nm band pass filter (donor emission). The energy transferred to GFP10 (emission peak 510 nm) was detected using a 500–530-nm band pass filter. Readings were collected with a modified top count apparatus (BRETCount, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) that allows sequential integration of the signals detected at 370–450 nm (bioluminescence signal) and at 500–530 nm (fluorescence signal). The BRET signal (BRET ratio) was quantified by calculating the fluorescence/luminescence ratio as previously reported (33Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

The BRET ratio was found to be stable over several readings performed at different times after addition of the substrate (here evaluated in a 5–20-min range) (23Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). Expression level of each construct was determined by direct measurements of total fluorescence and luminescence on aliquots of transfected cell samples. The GFP10 total fluorescence was measured using a FluoroCount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation filter at 400 nm, an emission filter at 510 nm, and the following parameters: gain 1; PMT 1100 V; time 1.0 s. After the fluorescence measurement, the same cells were incubated for 10 min with coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 5 μm and the total luminescence of cells was measured using a LumiCount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the following parameters: gain 1; PMT 700 V; time 0.5 s. In contrast to deep blue coelenterazine, coelenterazine H does not lead to energy transfer to GFP10 and thus allows assess to Rluc activity without GFP10 emission quenching. The BRET ratios were plotted as a function of the GFP/LUC fusion protein expression ratio, both fusion proteins expression being assessed with the same cells as described above, to take into account the potential variations in the expression of individual constructs from transfection to transfection. BRET titration curves were fitted using a non-linear regression equation (GraphPad Prism). Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin) at 4 °C for 20 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The extracts were precleared over protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Co-immunoprecipitations of the precleared extracts were carried out with protein A-Sepharose (50 μl) and mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5). Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and the recovered proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred for Western blotting. Pull-down assay with MBP and MBP fusions were performed as described by Gebelein and Urrutia (34Gebelein B. Urrutia R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 928-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells transiently transfected with pCGN-HA-KAP1 (5 μg) were solubilized for 20 min in RIPA buffer (1 ml/∼107 cells). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the equivalent of 3 × 106 solubilized cells was first incubated with an equimolar quantity of purified MBP or MBP fusion protein (0.5–1 μg) for 2 h, re-centrifuged to eliminate any potential insoluble material, and then incubated with an amylose resin for 1 h. Complexes retained by the washed affinity resin were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred for Western blotting. After the anti-HA immunodetection, the blot was dehybridized and rehybridized with an anti-MBP antibody to confirm the loading of equivalent amounts of MBP fusion proteins (data not shown). The expression of epitope-tagged and fusion proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes was verified by Western blotting using the 12CA5 mouse anti-HA antibody (35Niman H.L. Houghten R.A.

Following addition of the appropriate secondary antibody (either a sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase), a chemiluminescence reagent was used (Renaissance kit, Amersham Biosciences). Oligomerization of TIF1 Family Members Detected in Living Cells—Although the presence of interaction motifs such as a ring finger, B boxes, and a coiled-coil domain (RBCC) suggests that members of the TIF1 family could oligomerize, studies assessing such interactions led to conflicting results (5Venturini L.

Because the transfer of energy between a bioluminescence donor luciferase and a fluorophore acceptor GFP occurs with a R0 of ∼50 Å and that no transfer would be detected for distances above 100 Å (22Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), BRET was used to monitor intermolecular interactions between these potential partners. To this end, full-length KAP-1 and TIF1α were tagged at their amino terminus with either Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc) or Aequorea GFP green variant (GFP10) (Fig. 1A). Homomeric and heteromeric pairs were then co-expressed in 293T cells and the occurrence of BRET was determined by measuring the ratio of the light emitted by the GFP (410 ± 40 nm) and the luciferase (515 ± 15 nm) upon addition of the membrane-permeable luciferase substrate coelenterazine. The BRET ratio was plotted as a function of the GFP/LUC fusion protein expression ratio (both fusion protein expression being individually assessed in each sample as described under “Experimental Procedures”) to take into account the potential variations in the expression of individual constructs from transfection to transfection. As shown in Fig. 1A, significant BRET ratios, indicative of protein proximity, were detected for the Rluc-KAP1/GFP10-KAP1, Rluc-TIF1α/GFP10-TIF1α, and Rluc-TIF1α/GFP10-KAP1 pairs. In each case, when a fixed amount of Rluc fusion was transfected, the BRET ratio increased as a function of the amount GFP fusion transfected and reached a maximum when the amount of expressed GFP fusion (acceptor) was no longer limiting compared with Rluc fusion (donor). Such saturation is indicative of a specific interaction. When considering the heteromeric TIF1α/KAP1 pair, identical results were obtained for the two possible BRET orientations (i.e. Rluc-TIF1α/GFP10-KAP1 and Rluc-KAP1/GFP10-TIF1; data not shown). Because as most techniques, BRET cannot distinguish between dimers and higher order oligomeric species, the term oligomers is used to describe the detected interactions with the understanding that some of the complexes may be simple dimers. To ascertain the specificity of the KAP-1 and TIF1α oligomers detected, BRET was measured in cells co-expressing Rluc-KAP1 or Rluc-TIF1α and a construct targeting cytoplasmic GFP to the nucleus by fusion to a nuclear localization signal (GFP10-NLS construct). The efficient nuclear targeting of GFP10-NLS, GFP10-TIF1α, and GFP10-KAP1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (not shown). Only marginal BRET, most likely resulting"

Binding of these antigens to P-selectin on platelets is thought to facilitate formation of platelet-tumor emboli in the circulation, which in turn allows sequestration of the tumor cells in the microvasculature. Here we report a pharmacologic approach for blocking these interactions through metabolic inhibition of sialylation. Peracetylated forms of Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ-O-naphthalenemethanol and GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ-O-naphthalenemethanol were taken up by LS180 human colon carcinoma cells, O-deacetylated, and utilized as biosynthetic intermediates, resulting in heterogeneous oligosaccharides. The primed oligosaccharides included sialylated, sulfated, and fucosylated products based on mass spectrometry. Assembly of free oligosaccharides on the glycosides decoyed glycosylation of cellular glycoproteins, as assessed by altered binding of lectins and carbohydrate-specific antibodies. Expression of α2,3-sialylated oligosaccharides on the cell surface was diminished specifically, whereas α2,6-sialylation and fucosylation were not. In U937 lymphoma cells, the glycosides decreased fucosylation without affecting sialylation. The differential inhibitory activities correlated inversely with fucosyltransferase and sialyltransferase activity based on enzyme assays and microarray analysis. Regardless of the mechanism, the disaccharides blocked the cells from forming selectin ligands and inhibited adhesion to immobilized selectins, suggesting that the glycosides might prove useful for interfering with tumor cell adhesion and metastasis.

Varki A. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 569-576Google Scholar). Clustered arrangements of these antigens can mediate binding of tumor cells to selectin adhesion receptors on activated endothelia, platelets, or leukocytes, which is thought to increase the probability that tumor cells lodge as “emboli” in the microvasculature of distant organs during metastasis (2Kim Y.J.

Thus, a pharmacologic strategy for metabolically altering selectin ligand expression would be desirable, since it might lead to novel therapeutic agents for treating metastatic disease. Attempts to design inhibitors of glycosylation have focused on alkaloids that alter processing of Asn-linked oligosaccharides (15Goss P.E. Baker M.A. Carver J.P. Dennis J.W. Clin Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 935-944Google Scholar), glycosides of N-acetylgalactosamine (16Kojima N. Handa K. Newman W. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1288-1295Google Scholar), various fluorinated analogs of common sugars (17Woynarowska B. Skrincosky D.M. Haag A. Sharma M. Matta K. Bernacki R.J. J. Biol.

Several compounds partially inhibit O-linked (mucin-like) oligosaccharide synthesis when added to cells at millimolar concentrations, such as N-acetylgalactosaminides (e.g. GalNAcα-O-benzyl) (22Gouyer V. Leteurtre E. Zanetta J.P. Lesuffleur T. Delannoy P. Huet G. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1235-D1244Google Scholar). This agent resembles naturally occurring glycoprotein intermediates (GalNAcα-O-Thr/Ser present in glycoproteins) and diverts oligosaccharide synthesis from endogenous glycoconjugates to the exogenous glycoside. Thus, the compound acts as a “primer” and a metabolic decoy. Suitably conjugated disaccharides also act as primers, such as per-O-acetylated Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ-O-naphthalenemethanol (AcGGn-NM), GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ-O-naphthalenemethanol (AcGnG-NM), and Galβ1,3GalNAcα-O-naphthalenemethanol, since these compounds resemble intermediates en route to mature O-linked chains of glycoproteins. Disaccharide-based primers act at much lower concentrations than N-acetylgalactosaminides (10–50 μmversus 1–2 mm, respectively) (23Sarkar A.K. Fritz T.A. Taylor W.H. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hal-8, MCF-7, and MV-522 cells were gifts from Dr. Osamu Matsuo (Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka), Dr. Renate Pilz (University of California, San Diego), and Dr. Nissi Varki (University of California, San Diego), respectively. All other cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) (LS180, CCL 187; WiDr, CCL 218; A549, CCL 185; H460, HTB 177; A427, HTB 53; BT-20, HTB 19; SK-BR-3, HTB 30; PC-3, CRL 435; and U937, CRL 1593). Radiolabeling experiments were done in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with low glucose (1 mm) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), glutamine (0.3 g/liter), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air and passaged every 4 days using ATV™ trypsin solution (Invitrogen). Flow Cytometry—To detect the presence or absence of certain carbohydrate determinants, cells were stained with a variety of plant lectins and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Approximately 5 × 105 cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of assay buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide, and 1% goat serum) containing different lectins (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA): biotinylated Maackia amurensis hemagglutinin (10 μg/ml), biotinylated Aleuria aurantia lectin (2 μg/ml), or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated forms of Sambucus nigra agglutinin (4–10 μg/ml), peanut agglutinin (25–50 μg/ml), Erythrina cristagalli lectin (2.5 μg/ml), Griffonia simplicifolia lectin II (500 μg/ml), Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (10 μg/ml), Solanum tuberosum lectin (20 μg/ml), Ricinus communis agglutinin I (100 μg/ml), and Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin (2–10 μg/ml). M. amurensis hemagglutinin lectin- and A. aurantia lectin-stained cells were washed and incubated with Streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (1.85 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). In some experiments, cells were incubated with the monoclonal antibodies CSLEX-1 (anti-sLex; 5 μg/ml) or CD15 (anti-Lex; 8 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibodies against mouse or human IgM (30 μg/ml). Analysis of Primed Oligosaccharides—AcGGn-NM and AcGnG-NM were dissolved in Me2SO and added to growth medium to achieve the concentrations indicated in the table and figures. The final concentration of Me2SO was adjusted to 0.5% (v/v). Cells were added to the supplemented medium at a density of ∼2 × 105 cells/ml. LS180 cells were incubated with the disaccharides and 50 μCi/ml of [6-3H]fucose, [6-3H]galactose, [6-3H]GlcN, or H235SO4. The conditioned medium was adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl and centrifuged to remove any particulate material, and the supernatants were applied to C18 Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA) that had been prewashed sequentially with methanol, water, and 0.5 m NaCl. After application of the samples, the columns were washed with 0.5 m NaCl (2.5 ml) and water (25 ml). Radioactive oligosaccharides were eluted with 40% methanol. The products were analyzed by anion-exchange chromatography, (QAE-Sephadex; Sigma) to separate the charged and neutral radiolabeled products (27Roux L. Holojda S. Sundblad G. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8879-8889Google Scholar). A sample of charged radiolabeled oligosaccharides was treated with Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (20 milliunits/106 cells (Calbiochem)) and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (TosoHaas RP18, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, Tosoh Biosep LLC, Montgomeryville, PA) connected to a HPXL solvent delivery system (Rainin Instrument Company, Oakland, CA). The column was first washed with water (flow rate 0.5 ml/min) and then with increasing amounts of acetonitrile in water. Radioactivity in the eluant was monitored by the Radiomatic Flo-one Beta detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) connected in-line to the column. Mass spectrometric data were recorded on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ classic mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). Samples containing primed products in water (10 μl) were introduced into the electrospray ionization ion trap using an autosampler connected to a TSP P400 quaternary pump using 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. The data were fit to compositions of known oligosaccharides present in animal cells. Binding of CSLEX-1 and Selectin Chimeras to Tumor Cells—To measure the presence of selectin ligands, cells were grown to confluence for 4–7 days in six-well plates. Binding of CSLEX-1 and selectin/IgG chimeras (Ps-Ig and Es-Ig) (28Koenig A. Norgard-Sumnicht K. Linhardt R. Varki A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 877-889Google Scholar) was performed as described (24Sarkar A.K. Rostand K.S. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25608-25616Google Scholar), except the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay incubation buffer consisted of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with calcium (Invitrogen), 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% NaN3, and 1% goat serum. U937 cells were incubated with CSLEX-1 for 30 min, PC-3 cells for 3–4 h, and all other cell lines for 2 h in order to maximize binding. Incubations with Es-Ig (0.125–0.625 μg/ml) and Ps-Ig (0.1–0.5 μg/ml) were done for 1 h. In some experiments, cells were first treated for 1 h at 37 °C with A. ureafaciens sialidase in 100 μl of 0.05 m HEPES (pH 6.9) or 2 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell Adhesion to Immobilized Selectins—96-Well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with recombinant E- or P-selectin (2–16 μg/ml) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The plates were coated with E-selectin at 2 μg/ml for U937, LS180, BT-20, WiDr, and A549; 4 μg/ml for Hal-8 and A427; and 16 μg/ml for H460. For P-selectin, the optimal concentrations were 1 μg/ml for A427; 2 μg/ml for LS180, A549, and Hal-8; and 6 μg/ml for U937. Tumor cells were harvested with EDTA (5 mm, 20 min), resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine calf serum, labeled with Calcein AM (5 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and added to the selectin-coated wells (5 × 104 cells/well). The cells were allowed to settle for 25 min at room temperature, and the plates were then stirred at 75 rpm on an orbital shaker for 15 min. Nonadherent cells were removed at unit gravity by inverting the plates for 15 min in a vessel filled with phosphate-buffered saline (29St. John J.J. Schroen D.J. Cheung H.T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 170: 159-166Google Scholar). For Hal-8, A427, A549, H460, and MV522, the plates were inverted for only 2–5 min, since the cells were much less adherent. After inversion, the wells were aspirated, and the amount of fluorescence was measured using a computerized fluorimeter (CytoFluor II; Promega, Madison, WI), averaging the values of four wells for each condition. Controls included treating cells for1hat37 °C with A. ureafaciens sialidase (20 milliunits/1 × 106 cells) in 0.05 m HEPES buffer (pH 6.9), pretreating wells with anti-E-selectin or anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody (1 μg/well), or growth of cells in a 50 μm concentration of the inactive disaccharide, AcGalβ1,3Galβ-O-NM. Cell viability was judged to be >90% by trypan blue exclusion at the completion of each experiment. Sialyltransferase and Fucosyltransferase Assays—Total sialyltransferase and fucosyltransferase (FucT) activities were assayed in cell lysates prepared from U937 and LS180 cells. The cells were scraped from the culture dish in 50 μl of a solution containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) with protease inhibitor mixture (1:100; Sigma catalog no. P8340), and frozen at –80 °C. The protein content of each cell lysate was assessed by the Bradford assay. Total sialyltransferase assays (25 μl) contained 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), 0.25% Triton X-100, 15 mm MnCl2, 1 μCi of CMP-[9-3H]Neu5Ac (33.6 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.1 mm CMP-Neu5Ac, 1 mm Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ-O-NM, and 50 μg of cell lysate. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction products were diluted with 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. After washing the cartridge with 25 ml of water, the products were eluted with 50% methanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. FucT assays (20 μl) contained 25 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.2), 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.5 μCi of GDP-[2-3H]Fuc (17.3 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.1 mm GDP-Fuc, 1 mm Galβ1,4GlcNAc-NM or 1 mm SiaGalβ1,4GlcNAc (Sigma), and 50 μg of cell lysate. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h (Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ-O-NM, FucT-a) and 3 h (Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc, FucT-b). To separate the reaction products from GDP-[2-3H]Fuc, samples containing Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ-O-NM were diluted with 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. After washing the cartridge with 25 ml of water, the products were eluted with 50% methanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. Reactions containing Siaα2,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc were diluted with 0.5 ml of 5 mm PO4 (pH 6.8) and applied to a small column of Dowex 1 (X8–400, phosphate form). Reaction products eluted in the flow-through and the wash (2 ml of water) (30Natsuka S. Gersten K.M. Zenita K. Kannagi R. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16789-16794Google Scholar). Sample Preparation and Processing for Microarray Analysis—U937 and LS180 cells were grown in triplicate in 150-mm diameter culture dishes until confluent. RNA from each dish was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified using Rneasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept frozen at –80 °C. For each sample, 5 μg of total RNA was prepared using standard Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) GeneChip protocols for all labeling, staining, and scanning procedures (available on the World Wide Web at affymetrix.com) (31Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Google Scholar). Each labeled sample was hybridized to individual glyco-v1 chips, an oligonucleotide array custom designed for the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (available on the World Wide Web at web.mit.edu/glycomics/consortium). Briefly, each transcript was detected by one or more probe sets generally consisting of 11 probe pairs. Each probe pair is made up of one 25-base pair Perfect Match oligonucleotide that matches the sequence of the targeted transcript and an oligonucleotide designed with a mismatch at the center position. A complete list of probe sets and annotation for the glyco-v1 oligonucleotide array is available on the World Wide Web at web.mit.edu/glycomics/consortium/resources/resourcecoree.shtml. All GeneChip data were analyzed using Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0) (Affymetrix) and DNA Chip Analyzer (dChip) (32Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Google Scholar, 33Li C. Wong W.H. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 32.1-32.11Google Scholar) software. The hybridization signal intensities were generated in dChip using the “Perfect Match-only” model and normalized to the median array of the analyzed set. “Present,” “Marginal,” and “Absent” calls were based on “detection” p values determined using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software with all user-definable parameters set at the Affymetrix default values. The dChip software used all of the Affymetrix .CEL files generated in this study as a training set. Hierarchical clustering using centered correlation and average linkage was performed with the software BRB ArrayTools (available on the World Wide Web at linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html) developed by Dr. Richard Simon and Amy Peng at the Biometric Research Branch of the NCI, National Institutes of Health. Changes in gene expression between the study groups were determined using the following methodologies. To identify statistically significant changes in gene expression, significance analysis of microarrays was used (34Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Google Scholar). Delta values were chosen that minimized the median false discovery rate. Two additional methods were used to filter the gene list. First, we applied the limit -fold change model, which systematically bins genes by signal intensity; those genes within the top 5–10% of the highest -fold changes for each bin are selected (35Mutch D.M. Berger A. Mansourian R. Rytz A. Roberts M.A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/3/17)Google Scholar). Second, Affymetrix MAS 5.0 present/absent calls were used to filter the list. When comparing an expression measurement for a gene between two groups, we required the majority of calls in the up-regulated group to be “present.” Probe sets not meeting this criterion were eliminated from further analysis. The carbohydrate antigens sLex and sLea are expressed on leukocytes, epithelial cells, and many carcinomas in configurations that can be recognized by one or more selectin receptors. A survey of established tumor lines using a monoclonal antibody to sLex (CSLEX-1) showed that many express sLex-containing antigens, with the exception of the breast carcinomas, MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 (Table I). The pattern of reactivity correlated in most cell lines with binding of recombinant P-selectin-Ig and E-selectin-Ig chimeras, but not in all cases (e.g. A427 and A549 lung carcinomas, SK-BR-3 breast carcinoma, and PC-3 prostate carcinoma), consistent with the heterogeneity of carbohydrate ligands for these selectins. The LS180 human colon carcinoma was chosen for further study, since it expresses ligands that bound to CSLEX-1 and the selectin chimeras (Table I).Table IExpression of sLex and selectin ligands in tumor cellsCancer cell linesTissueBindingAdhesionCSLEX-1Ps-IgEs-IgP-selectinE-selectinLS180Colon+++ +++ +WiDrColon+++ +-+ +A549Lung++--+H460Lung+++-+/-A427Lung++ +-+-Hal-8Lung+/-+ +++/-+ +MV-522Lung+/-+ +++/-+ +BT-20Breast++ ++-+MCF-7Breast-+ ++/-+/-+/-SK-BR-3Breast--+NT+PC-3Prostate++-+/--U937Lymphoma++ +++ ++ + Open table in a new tab Peracetylated disaccharides, such as AcGGn-NM and AcGnG-NM, metabolically inhibit the expression of sLex in U937 lymphoma cells. Cells take up the glycosides by passive diffusion, deacetylate them with endogenous carboxyesterases, and use them as substrates for glycosyltransferases, resulting in the generation of oligosaccharides containing Lewis type antigens or precursor structures (23Sarkar A.K. Fritz T.A. Taylor W.H. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3323-3327Google Scholar, 24Sarkar A.K. Rostand K.S. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25608-25616Google Scholar, 25Sarkar A.K. Brown J.R. Esko J.D. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 329: 287-300Google Scholar). Both compounds are nontoxic up to 100 μm based on trypan blue exclusion and normal growth rates. To determine whether the disaccharides had similar properties in LS180 colon carcinoma cells, they were added to the culture medium along with radioactive fucose, galactose, glucosamine, or sulfate to label newly made oligosaccharides. Both compounds stimulated the incorporation of radiolabeled sugars and sulfate into glycans assembled on the exogenous primers, confirming that they were taken up, deacetylated, and made available to the glycosyltransferases in the cell (data not shown). The acetylated disaccharides resemble in behavior N-acetylgalactosaminides (e.g. GalNAcα-O-Bn), which without prior acetylation are taken up by most types of cells. However, GalNAcα-O-Bn impacts the first committed step in O-linked mucin biosynthesis, whereas the acetylated disaccharides tap into the biosynthetic pathways at later stages of oligosaccharide assembly. Furthermore, the disaccharide-based compounds are active at much lower concentrations (≥10 μmversus ≥0.5 mm, respectively). As shown below, the acetylated disaccharides show more selective effects than GalNAcα-O-Bn. To examine the full array of oligosaccharides generated on the disaccharide primers, samples were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (Table II). Several patterns were present, such as one or more Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3 units on GGn-NM and the addition of a Gal residue to GnG-NM, consistent with the presence of β1,4Gal and β1,3GlcNAc transferases. Fucose was added to several oligosaccharides primed on GGn-NM and GnG-NM, presumably in the latter case after the addition of a Gal residue (24Sarkar A.K. Rostand K.S. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25608-25616Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides generated on GGn-NM and GnG-NM consisted of both neutral and charged species, and the charged products contained sialic acid and/or sulfate residues. Most of the charged species consisted of sialylated oligosaccharides based on their conversion to neutral oligosaccharides by treatment with a nonspecific sialidase. Fig. 1 shows that the charged fucosylated oligosaccharides were mostly sialylated (the arrows indicate the position of neutral oligosaccharides derived from the charged compounds after treatment with sialidase). The resistant material contained sulfate as assessed by labeling studies with 35SO4 (data not shown). Both primers generated oligosaccharides that resembled Lewis and sialylated Lewis type antigens (Table II).Table IIMass spectrometry of oligosaccharides formed on GGn-NM and GnG-NM in LS180 colon adenocarcinoma cellsOligosaccharidesaHex, most likely galactose; Fuc, fucose; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid.CalculatedFound (m/z)[M + H]+[M + Na]+GGn-NM-neutral products[HexNAc]1GGn-NM726.3727.4749.3[Hex]1[HexNAc]1GGn-NM888.3889.8911.4[Hex]1[HexNAc]2GGn-NM1091.41092.31115.0[Hex]2[HexNAc]2GGn-NM1253.51254.71275.7[Fuc]1GGn-NM669.6670.3692.9[HexNAc]1[Fuc]1GGn-NM872.3873.3895.8[Hex]1[HexNAc]1[Fuc]1GGn-NM1034.41035.31057.2[Hex]1[HexNAc]1[Fuc]2GGn-NM1180.51181.81204.4[Hex]1[HexNAc]2[Fuc]2GGn-NM1383.51384.91407.3[Hex]2[HexNAc]2[Fuc]3GGn-NM1691.61692.31715.0GGn-NM-charged products[SO3H]1 [Fuc]1GGn-NM749.2750.2772.4[SO3H]2 [Fuc]1GGn-NM829.2830.3852.1[Neu5Ac]1[Fuc]1GGn-NM960.4961.9983.1GnG-NM-neutral products[Hex]1GnG-NM685.3686.5709.0[Hex]1[Fuc]1GnG-NM831.3832.3854.9GnG-NM-charged products[Neu5Ac]1[Hex]1GnG-NM976.4977.7999.9[Neu5Ac]1[Hex]1[Fuc]1GnG-NM1122.41123.11145.9[SO3H]1[Hex]1[Fuc]1GnG-NM911.3912.8934.8[SO3H]2[Hex]1[Fuc]1GnG-NM991.2992.71014.1a Hex, most likely galactose; Fuc, fucose; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid. Open table in a new tab Disaccharide Treatment Alters Glycosylation—To assess whether priming of oligosaccharides on the glycosides altered glycosylation of endogenous glycoconjugates, treated cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after reaction with fluorescent plant lectins and monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific carbohydrates. The signal intensity of untreated cells was set to 100% for each lectin or antibody, and the relative value for treated cells was determined (Fig. 2). In LS180 cells, staining by M. amurensis hemagglutinin, which recognizes terminal α2,3-linked sialic acid residues and 3-O-sulfated galactose (36Bai X.M. Brown J.R. Varki A. Esko J.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 621-632Google Scholar), was reduced by both disaccharides. Binding was completely abolished by sialidase treatment (data not shown), indicating that the major determinant expressed by LS180 cells was a sialylated component. Binding of the monoclonal antibody CD15, which recognizes Lex (Galβ1,4(Fucα1,3)GlcNAc-), increased or did not change, suggesting that fucosylation was not inhibited.

https://openalex.org/W2058403475,"ColQ, the collagen tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase, is responsible for anchoring the enzyme at the vertebrate synaptic basal lamina by interacting with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. To get insights about this function, the interaction of ColQ with heparin was analyzed. For this, heparin affinity chromatography of the complete oligomeric enzyme carrying different mutations in ColQ was performed. Results demonstrate that only the two predicted heparin-binding domains present in the collagen domain of ColQ are responsible for heparin interaction. Despite their similarity in basic charge distribution, each heparin-binding domain had different affinity for heparin. This difference is not solely determined by the number or nature of the basic residues conforming each site, but rather depends critically on local structural features of the triple helix, which can be influenced even by distant regions within ColQ. Thus, ColQ possesses two heparin-binding domains with different properties that may have non-redundant functions. We hypothesize that these binding sites coordinate acetylcholinesterase positioning within the organized architecture of the neuromuscular junction basal lamina.

We hypothesize that these binding sites coordinate acetylcholinesterase positioning within the organized architecture of the neuromuscular junction basal lamina. At vertebrate cholinergic synapses, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 1The abbreviations used are: AChE, acetylcholinesterase; HBD, heparin-binding domain; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, HS proteoglycan; WT, wild-type. rapidly hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby terminating synaptic transmission. This key function does not only require a high catalytic turnover number but also a strategic positioning of the enzyme. This is achieved by the association of AChE catalytic subunits with structural subunits that bring them to the site of action. In the case of asymmetric AChE, the collagen ColQ is responsible for the localization of the enzyme at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. Inactivation of the ColQ gene in mice or mutations in the human ColQ gene result in the absence of enzyme accumulation at the neuromuscular junction and are the cause of a congenital myasthenic syndrome (type 1c) (1Feng G. Krejci E. Molgo J. Cunningham J.M. Massoulié J. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1349-1360Google Scholar, 2Ohno K. Engel A.G. Brengman J.M. Shen X.-M. Heidenreich F. Vincent A. Milone M. Tan E. Demirci M. Walsh P. Nakano S. Akiguchi I. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 162-170Google Scholar). As found in other collagens, ColQ contains a central triple-helical domain surrounded by non-collagenous N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 1A). Each N-terminal domain organizes an AChE tetramer, so the triple-helical structure generates an A12 or asymmetric AChE form with 12 catalytic subunits (3Krejci E. Coussen F. Duval N. Chatel J.M. Legay C. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Cartaud J. Bon S. Massoulié J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1285-1293Google Scholar, 4Bon S. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3016-3021Google Scholar). The collagen domain is characterized by Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats and a high proportion of the stabilizing proline and hydroxyproline residues. The C-terminal domain is divided into a proline-rich region, important for triple-helix formation (5Bon S. Ayon A. Leroy J. Massoulié J. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 523-535Google Scholar), and a cysteine-rich region probably involved in the anchorage of AChE at the neuromuscular junction, since mutations in this region prevent the accumulation of AChE in congenital myasthenic syndrome type 1c patients (2Ohno K. Engel A.G. Brengman J.M. Shen X.-M. Heidenreich F. Vincent A. Milone M. Tan E. Demirci M. Walsh P. Nakano S. Akiguchi I. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 162-170Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have been implicated in the anchorage of asymmetric AChE to the synaptic basal lamina by interacting with ColQ through their heparan sulfate (HS) chains. This was proposed after showing that AChE could be specifically solubilized from the tissue with heparinase as well as with HS and heparin (6Brandan E. Maldonado M. Garrido J. Inestrosa N.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 985-992Google Scholar). Consistently, binding of the enzyme to the cell surface is inhibited after treatment of the myotubes with heparitinase and in cells deficient in HS synthesis (7Inestrosa N.C. Gordon H. Esko J.D. Hall Z.H. Shafferman A. Velan B. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Cholinestease Function. Plenum Press, New York1992: 25-32Google Scholar). Later studies showed that exogenously added asymmetric AChE associated specifically with nerve-muscle contact sites in a heparin-sensitive manner (8Rotundo R.L. Rossi S.G. Anglister L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 367-374Google Scholar), suggesting that HSPGs would define its localization at the neuromuscular junction. Perlecan, a basal lamina HSPG, has been proposed as the receptor of collagen-tailed AChE (9Peng H.B. Xie H. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 911-921Google Scholar), consistent with the recent finding that AChE is not accumulated at the neuromuscular junction in perlecan-null mice (10Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Yamada Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 119-123Google Scholar). In this context, we have found that the collagen domain of ColQ contains two heparin-binding consensus sequences of the BBXB form (where B represents a basic residue) surrounded by other basic residues and proposed they constitute the sites for HSPG recognition (11Deprez P. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11043-11046Google Scholar). We have characterized the structural properties of those putative heparin-binding domains (HBDs) by using molecular modeling and synthetic peptides (12Deprez P. Inestrosa N.C. Protein Engng. 2000; 13: 27-34Google Scholar, 13Deprez P. Doss-Pepe E. Brodsky B. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 283-290Google Scholar, 14Doss-Pepe E. Deprez P. Inestrosa N.C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14884-14892Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed ColQ-heparin interactions by heparin affinity chromatography of the entire A12 AChE, carrying different mutations in ColQ. We first established that recombinant and purified A12 enzymes share the same properties. Then we dissected the participation of the different domains of ColQ as well as of the individual basic residues composing both HBDs to define the determinants of heparin binding. The results obtained provide evidence that expands the role of ColQ-HSPGs interactions to the fine ultrastructural organization of AChE at the synaptic basal lamina. Moreover, they contribute to our understanding of the nature of a HBD in the context of the canonical structure of collagen. Materials—All restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ozyme, France). Other molecular biology reagents were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were synthesized either by Oligo Express or Eurobio (Paris, France). Heparin-agarose was purchased from Pierce. Heparin-albumin was obtained from Sigma. Acridine-agarose was kindly provided by Dr. Terry Rosenberry (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Unless otherwise specified, other reagents were obtained from commercial sources. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Two different plasmids were constructed using the coding sequences for rat AChE and ColQ1a (15Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Google Scholar, 16Krejci E. Legay C. Thomine S. Sketelj J. Massoulié J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10672-10679Google Scholar). Both coding sequences were inserted between 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences of Xenopus globin mRNA and then subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant vector pcDNA3-ColQ1a served as a template for site-directed mutagenesis, performed as described by Kunkel (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of desired mutations, all mutant plasmids were sequenced by Génome Express (Montreuil sous Bois, France). Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Capped synthetic transcripts were prepared using the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ in vitro transcription kit (Austin, TX). Samples of ∼50 nl containing 2.5 ng of AChE mRNA and different amounts of ColQ mRNA were injected with a Drummond Nanojet injection system (Broomall, PA) into the animal poles of Xenopus oocytes (18Soreq H. Parvari R. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 830-834Google Scholar). Injected oocytes were incubated at 18 °C for 24–48 h in Barth medium (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 98 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid to promote triple-helix formation. Extraction and Isolation of Recombinant AChE—Injected Xenopus oocytes were homogenized by repeated pipetting in 10 μl/oocyte of ice-cold extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.8 m NaCl, 1% Brij-96. Different AChE molecular forms were isolated by velocity sedimentation in 5–20% linear sucrose gradients containing extraction buffer. Sucrose gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 15 h at 7 °C in a SW41 Beckman rotor (Fullerton, CA) and were collected in ∼48 fractions of ∼320 μl each from which 10 μl/fraction were used to measure AChE activity (19Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V.J. Featherstones R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients for AChE forms were determined from those of β-galactosidase (16 S) and alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) from Escherichia coli, run in the gradients as internal markers. Fractions containing the different AChE forms were pooled and stored at –80 °C for future analysis. For comparison, the different forms of AChE isolated from the sucrose gradient were further purified by affinity chromatography using an acridine-agarose column as for enzyme extracted from Torpedo electric organ, but since they showed exactly the same behavior as the enzyme isolated directly from the sucrose gradients, this enzyme was more often used for the experiments. Purification of Torpedo Asymmetric AChE—Asymmetric AChE was purified from Torpedo californica electric organ (Pacific Bio-Marine Laboratory, Venice, CA) using sequential extraction and affinity chromatography, as described previously (13Deprez P. Doss-Pepe E. Brodsky B. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 283-290Google Scholar). Heparin-Agarose Affinity Columns—Relative affinity for heparin was analyzed for different ColQ mutants using heparin-agarose affinity columns, where the bound enzyme was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. After packing 500 μl of heparin-agarose in a column without flow, the affinity resin was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl, and 20–60 milliunits of asymmetric AChE in equilibration buffer were loaded. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, and the enzyme was finally eluted using a 20-ml linear NaCl gradient of either 0.1–0.8 m NaCl or 0.2–0.9 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Loading, washing, and elution steps were performed at a constant flow rate of 9.75 ml/h, maintained by a Gilson Miniplus 2 peristaltic pump. Approximately 77 fractions of ∼260 μl each were collected. For all of these, 100-μl aliquots were used to determine AChE activity, whereas aliquots of 100 μl diluted with 1 ml of distilled water were used to measure conductivity using an Amber Science Inc. 605 conductivity meter (Eugene, OR). Conductivity values were converted to NaCl concentrations using a 5-point standard curve with NaCl solutions made up with elution buffer. NaCl concentrations increased by 0.0105 ± 0.0006 m/fraction (n = 97). Equilibrium Binding Assays—Binding assays were performed in MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) coated with heparin coupled to albumin as described previously (13Deprez P. Doss-Pepe E. Brodsky B. Inestrosa N.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 283-290Google Scholar). After coating and blocking steps, the plates were incubated with 0.25 milliunits of recombinant A12 AChE (non-saturating amount of enzyme) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl for 18 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. The supernatant was recovered, the plates were washed twice with 100 μl of incubation buffer for 5 min, and AChE activity was measured in the supernatant and washes (both representing the unbound enzyme) as well directly in the plates (bound enzyme). Data Treatment—To analyze the peak composition of elution profiles of AChE from heparin-agarose columns, the noise present in raw data was filtered using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm, the base line was detected and subtracted using a non-parametric algorithm, and finally, the peaks were detected and fitted to Gaussian peaks using the method of the second derivative (r2 > 0.999) using the program PeakFit™ 4.06 from SPSS Inc. (Chicago, IL). To facilitate the analysis of elution profiles of AChE from heparin-agarose and the comparison between different asymmetric AChE mutants, raw data from AChE elution profiles were plotted for AChE activity versus NaCl concentration, fitted to a non-parametric base line that was then subtracted, and converted to cumulative areas using the program PeakFit™ 4.06 from SPSS Inc. (Chicago, IL). Using the Origin® 6.0 program from Microcal Software Inc. (Northampton, MA), cumulative area values were normalized to percentages and the data plotted as cumulative areas (%) versus logarithm of NaCl concentration (m) were fitted to a dose-response (or four parameter) sigmoidal equation with variable slope, y=A1+A2−A11+10(logx0−x)p(Eq. 1) where the parameters A1, A2, log x0, and p correspond to the bottom asymptote, the top asymptote, the center, and the variable Hill slope, respectively. Finally, starting from the center parameter value (i.e. log[NaCl]), the NaCl concentration for 50% elution of the bound enzyme was obtained for each curve. This value was used in this study as a measure of the relative affinity of a given A12 AChE mutant for heparin. In the different experiments, statistical analyses were performed using the unpaired Student's t test. Production of Recombinant Rat A12AChE and Its Affinity for Heparin—Xenopus oocytes constitute a very efficient system to produce predominantly A12 AChE forms by injecting defined amounts of both ColQ and AChE mRNAs (16Krejci E. Legay C. Thomine S. Sketelj J. Massoulié J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10672-10679Google Scholar), as shown by the sedimentation profile in a sucrose gradient of oocyte extracts (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the heparin-binding behavior of recombinant rat asymmetric AChE, its A12 form produced in Xenopus oocytes was isolated from a sucrose gradient, bound to a heparin-agarose column, and eluted from the resin using a linear NaCl gradient. This strategy allows determination of the values of relative affinity for heparin, where a protein with higher affinity is eluted at a higher NaCl concentration (20Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Google Scholar). A12 AChE purified from Torpedo electric organ was also analyzed as reference. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, both Torpedo purified and rat recombinant A12 AChE present the same elution profile, composed of five peaks eluting at the same NaCl concentrations and presenting similar relative abundance. In both cases the majority of the enzyme was eluted in the central peak at a concentration of 0.6 m NaCl. The same elution profile was obtained under different experimental conditions, varying the NaCl concentration increment per fraction, the elution volume, the elution flow rate, and the volume of resin (data not shown). Each peak differed significantly from its neighboring peaks both at the level of NaCl concentration of elution and relative abundance (n = 12, p < 0.0003). This multiplicity might reflect an intrinsic heterogeneity of enzyme species. To examine this possibility, AChE eluted in the first peak was re-loaded onto a second heparin-agarose column, generating the original five peaks in the elution profile (data not shown). This excludes the possibility that the enzyme is composed of chemically different species. Most likely, the observed behavior arises from the multivalent nature of the HBDs in ColQ (12Deprez P. Inestrosa N.C. Protein Engng. 2000; 13: 27-34Google Scholar) and the heterogeneity of heparin molecules. To facilitate the analysis of the elution profiles of AChE from heparin-agarose and the comparison between different A12 AChE mutants, the elution profiles were expressed as cumulative areas versus log[NaCl]. The NaCl concentrations at which 50% of the bound enzyme was eluted were derived from these curves (see “Experimental Procedures”), and relate directly to their affinity for heparin. When expressed in this form, both Torpedo and recombinant rat enzymes presented the same elution curve, with 50% of the enzyme eluting at 0.6 m NaCl (Fig. 2D, Table I). These results show that the recombinant rat A12 AChE behaves exactly as the purified A12 enzyme from Torpedo electric organ, so that Xenopus oocytes constitute a good expression system for A12 AChE.Table INames, description, and relative affinity of the different A12 AChE variants Open table in a new tab The Heparin-binding Activity Is Localized in the Collagen Domain of ColQ—By analyzing the ColQ sequence, it is possible to identify two heparin-binding consensus sequences of the BBXB type in the collagen domain of ColQ. Other clusters of basic residues also exist within the N- and C-terminal non-collagenous domains of ColQ, and it has been suggested that the C-terminal domain could participate in binding to HSPGs (2Ohno K. Engel A.G. Brengman J.M. Shen X.-M. Heidenreich F. Vincent A. Milone M. Tan E. Demirci M. Walsh P. Nakano S. Akiguchi I. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 162-170Google Scholar). To define the contribution of different domains to heparin binding, AChE oligomers containing ColQ with different deletions were expressed and analyzed. In ΔCt, the last 88 residues of ColQ were deleted, corresponding to the cysteine-rich region of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1B). The remainder of the C-terminal domain was not removed because it is required for triple-helix folding. ΔCol contains a deletion of 171 amino acids in the central region of the collagen domain of ColQ that eliminates the two HBDs, but 7 proline-rich Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets were left to ensure the formation of a stable triple helix. Finally, QN contained only the N-terminal domain of ColQ, allowing the organization of AChE tetramers to occur independently of the collagen domain. Fig. 3A shows the sedimentation profiles of the different ColQ deletion mutants co-expressed with AChE in Xenopus oocytes. As expected, ΔCt and ΔCol were able to produce asymmetric forms of AChE, whereas QN only produced a tetramer of catalytic subunits (G4 form). AChE expressed with ΔCt presented a sedimentation profile similar to wild type (WT), whereas asymmetric forms produced with ΔCol presented higher sedimentation coefficients, consistent with a decreased asymmetry of the molecules due to a shortened collagen tail. The A12 ΔCol and ΔCt forms as well as the QN G4 form were isolated from the sucrose gradients and run on heparin-agarose columns. As shown in Fig. 3B, QN and ΔCol completely lost their ability to bind heparin, whereas ΔCt presented an elution profile similar to WT (Fig. 3C). The NaCl concentrations at which 50% of the total bound enzyme eluted was 0.61 m for the WT enzyme and 0.63 m for ΔCt, not differing significantly (see Table I for mutant sequences, nomenclature, and elution values and Fig. 9 for a summary of relative heparin affinity of all the mutants). Together, these results clearly show that the heparin-binding activity of asymmetric AChE resides exclusively in the collagen domain of ColQ. The Basic Residues of Both HBDs in the Collagen Domain of ColQ Interact with Heparin—To confirm that the heparin-binding consensus sequences present in the collagen domain of ColQ are responsible for interactions with heparin, double site-directed mutagenesis was carried out. The first two basic residues of both BBXB consensus sequences were replaced by aspartic acid and proline (N–/C–, Table I). Aspartic acid was chosen to obtain a dramatic effect because the opposite charge was likely to cause heparin repulsion. Proline was used as it lacks a reactive side chain and tends to play a structural rather than a functional role (21Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Google Scholar). Only 55% of N–/C– AChE was retained in heparin-agarose, with the bound enzyme eluting at 0.17 m NaCl (Fig. 4, A and B). This suggests that the BBXB sequences in ColQ may be essential for heparin interactions under physiological conditions. Indeed, an equilibrium binding assay performed at 0.15 m NaCl using heparin-coated plates showed that only 16% of the N–/C– enzyme was able to bind heparin (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the fact that N–/C– still presented some heparin-binding capacity suggested that the basic residues surrounding the BBXB motif may also participate in this interaction. To assess this possibility, almost all basic residues constituting both putative HBDs were substituted by alanines (N=/C=, Table I). In this case, only 14% of the N=/C= mutant enzyme was retained by heparin-agarose, with only 5% able to bind heparin under equilibrium conditions (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal HBDs, comprising BBXB motifs surrounded by other basic residues and localized in the collagen domain of ColQ, are responsible for the interaction of A12 AChE with heparin. The Two HBDs in the Collagen Domain of ColQ Have Different Affinities for Heparin—To analyze the behavior of each HBD separately, two ColQ mutants were generated by interrupting a single BBXB motif and leaving the other intact. Thus, N–/C+ allowed the analysis of the C-terminal HBD and N+/C– of the N-terminal HBD (Fig. 1B). In both cases, the modified BBXB sequence was substituted by DPXB (Table I). Both mutants were fully retained in heparin-agarose as the WT enzyme but eluted from the column at different NaCl concentrations (Fig. 5A). Whereas the N–/C+ enzyme eluted at 0.54 m NaCl, the value for N+/C– was 0.41 m, implying that the C-terminal HBD has a significantly higher affinity for heparin than the N-terminal HBD. Interestingly, both N–/C+ and N+/C– mutants presented lower affinities for heparin than the WT enzyme (0.61 m), suggesting that WT affinity results from the simultaneous or cooperative participation of both HBDs. The Difference between the Two HBDs Does Not Simply Result from the Different Number or Nature of Basic Residues— Although ColQ HBDs share a minimum GRPBBXB sequence, the two sites differ both in the number and nature of basic residues. The C-terminal HBD presents two additional basic residues that are not found in the N-terminal HBD. To evaluate whether these extra basic residues could explain the higher heparin affinity of the C-terminal HBD, these residues were replaced by alanines (N–/R218A-K233A, Table I). Fig. 5B shows that the resultant mutant had a slightly lower affinity for heparin than N–/C+, eluting at a concentration of 0.51 m NaCl. This suggests that the extra basic residues at the C-terminal HBD participate in heparin interactions even if their contribution is small. However, N–/R218A-K233A presented a heparin affinity significantly higher than that of the N-terminal HBD (N+/C–), showing that the basic charge difference between the two HBDs does not underlie their different affinities for heparin. The second difference between the two HBDs lies in the identity of basic residues that constitute each BBXB motif: RKGR for the N-terminal and KRGK for the C-terminal domain, with both sequences conserved among species. To assess whether this could explain the different affinities for heparin, we designed two new ColQ mutants in which the BBXB motifs were exchanged between the sites. Having eliminated the C-terminal motif, the remaining N-terminal BBXB sequence was replaced by that of the C terminus and vice versa (Fig. 1B, Table I). As shown in Fig. 5B, the C→N/C– mutant, which presents only the C-terminal BBXB motif located at the N-terminal position, eluted from the heparin-agarose column at the same NaCl concentration as N+/C–. Similarly, N–/N→ C, which presents the N-terminal consensus sequence at the C-terminal position, behaved exactly as did N–/C+. These results indicate that the different heparin affinities of the two HBDs are not explained by the identities of the basic residues that constitute each BBXB motif. Contribution of Individual Basic Residues to Heparin Interactions—To evaluate individual residue contributions within the two binding sites, point mutations were carried out in each HBD to eliminate basic charges while trying to alter the local conformation as little as possible. Arginine or lysine residues located in the Xaa position as well as lysines in the Yaa position of Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets were substituted by alanines, whereas proline was used to replace arginines in the Yaa position. Previous studies show arginine and proline in the Yaa position to be equally stabilizing, whereas the stability of arginine in the Xaa position as well of lysines in both positions were equivalent to alanine (22Yang W. Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28837-28840Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, all N-terminal HBD mutants displayed decreased heparin affinities, suggesting the involvement of all residues from this HBD in heparin binding. According to the relative affinity loss presented by each mutant, the importance of each basic residue was ranked as Lys-122 > Arg-124 > Arg-118 ≥ Arg-121. In the C-terminal HBD, all mutations generated a significant change in heparin affinity (Fig. 6B). The mutation of any basic residue from the common GRPGBBGB sequence led to a decrease in heparin affinity. Residues were ranked in the following order of importance: Lys-226 > Lys-229» Arg-227 » Arg-223. Unexpectedly, the mutation of the most distal surrounding basic residues led to an increase in heparin affinity. The NaCl concentration required to elute N–/R218P did not differ significantly from the WT enzyme, in which both HBDs are intact, whereas that of N–/K233A surpassed it (Table I). Effect of Local Stability on Heparin Binding—From results shown in Fig. 5B, it is clear that neither the amount of basic charge nor the nature of the basic residues in the HBDs is the only determinant for heparin affinity, suggesting that structural factors such as local conformation could play a role. Proline is the most stabilizing residue found in collagens (21Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Google Scholar). Hence, basic residues from each HBD were selected to be replaced alternatively with alanine or proline. In the N-terminal HBD, substitution of the central lysine by proline caused a small affinity loss in contrast to the dramatic decrease observed for alanine substitution (Fig. 7A). In the C-terminal HBD, substitution of Arg-227 by proline induced a lower decrease in heparin affinity than substitution by alanine. For Arg-218, mutation to alanine decreased the affinity, whereas mutation to proline increased the affinity for heparin (Fig. 7B). In each case, affinity was higher with a proline than with an alanine. Contribution of the Distant Environment to Heparin Binding—Because local conformation seemed to be important in modulating heparin affinity, the possibility that regions distant from the HBDs could influence ColQ-heparin interactions was investigated. For this, ColQ deletions were designed to subject each HBD and its local environment to the same distant environment. The local environment was defined as the five triplets flanking each BBXB motif, so that each broader “mega”-HBD comprised 12 triplets. A single mega-HBD was then conserved, and the entire sequence (35 triplets) between the N-terminal limits of these domains was deleted (Figs. 1B and 8A). Thus, ΔN contained the C-terminal HBD and vice versa for ΔC, both surrounded by the most C-terminal and N-terminal regions of ColQ. Both constructs were able to produce truncated asymmetric AChE forms in Xenopus oocytes, exhibiting identical sedimentation profiles in sucrose gradients characterized by increased S values (Fig. 8B). As shown in Fig. 8C, ΔN eluted from the heparin column at 0.5 m NaCl, a value lower than that of N–/C+, whereas the ΔC mutant eluted at 0.47 m NaCl, higher than N+/C– (see Fig. 9 for a summary of relative heparin affinity of all the mutants).

When co-expressed with the C1a splice variant, the Δe13 isoform colocalized with the C1a isoform within the cell but not at the cell surface. Furthermore, the overexpression of the Δe13 variant led to a significant reduction of the C1a surface expression and consequently a reduction of the cAMP response and Erk phosphorylation after ligand stimulation.

It inhibits motility and induces marked cellular retraction of isolated osteoclasts, two effects that are thought to be essential to the CT-induced inhibition of bone resorption (3Zaidi M.

Recent data indicate that in the presence of “receptor activitymodifying proteins,” the CTR functions as a receptor for amylin, and therefore the complexes of the CTR with receptor activity-modifying protein 1, 2, or 3 are called AMY1-, AMY2-, and AMY3-receptor, respectively (11Spedding M.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that the GBR1 isoform bears an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal that is blocked by dimerization with the GBR2 isoform, allowing endoplasmic reticulum export and plasma membrane targeting (26Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Others reported that effects of GPCR dimerization include changing ligand selectivity and altered signal transduction (27Brady A.E. Limbird L.E. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Since there are numerous alternatively spliced transcripts of the CTR gene product, and some of the splice variants show considerable differences in their trafficking or receptor function, dimerization of these splice variants could result in profound changes in the biology of the CTR. We show here that the Δe13 variant accumulates within the cell and is only minimally expressed on the cell surface, whereas the C1a variant of the rabbit CTR is highly expressed on the cell surface. We also show that when both splice variants are expressed in the same cell, they form both homodimers and heterodimers, via interaction of the C-terminal tail but also via at least one other domain of the receptor. Co-expression of the Δe13 and C1a isoforms results in a marked decrease in the surface expression of the C1a isoform. Moreover, the reduced surface expression of the C1a isoform was accompanied by diminished cAMP production and Erk phosphorylation after ligand stimulation, suggesting that the dimerization of the Δe13 isoform with the C1a isoform serves to down-regulate CT-induced signaling by retaining the C1a splice variant in an intracellular compartment.

Enhanced chemiluminescence solutions and nitrocellulose membranes were from Amersham Biosciences and Schleicher & Schuell, respectively. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Minimal essential medium, α modification (α-MEM) was from Sigma. All media were supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. HEK 293 cells were cultured as described before (28Zhang Z. Hernandez-Lagunas L. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25093-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence and then transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. When not otherwise described (i.e. Fig. 2A), experiments that involved transfecting the CTR isoforms alone or in combination were performed with constant amounts of each cDNA and adding empty vector DNA when only one CTR isoform was expressed to keep the total amount of DNA constant. Production of Rabbit Osteoclast-like Cells—Rabbit osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) were produced as described before (29David J.P. Neff L. Chen Y. Rincon M. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, long bones and scapulae from 4-day-old rabbits were isolated and dissected from soft tissue. The bones were minced, the bone particles were allowed to settle, and the cells left in suspension were recovered by centrifugation. Cells were plated in culture dishes with α-MEM and 10% fetal calf serum. After overnight incubation, the nonadherent cells and the adherent stromal cells that could be removed with trypsin/EDTA were pooled and plated in 10-cm dishes in the presence of dihydroxyvitamin D (10–8m). After 7–9 days, the layer of stromal cells was removed from the differentiated OCLs by repeated pipetting of medium across the cell layer. The OCLs were detached by incubation in 50 mm EDTA in PBS at 37 °C for 5 min, washed in α-MEM, and resuspended in α-MEM containing 5% fetal calf serum. Single Osteoclast-like Cell Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Single cells from a rabbit OCL suspension in α-MEM containing 5% fetal calf serum were sorted in individual wells of a 96-well PCR plate (Costar Thermowell, Cambridge, MA) with a FACS device (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), selecting cells in the top 30% region of the cell size scatter. The wells of the PCR plate contained 10 μl of cold reverse transcription buffer (Sensiscript reverse transcription kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 0.5 units/μl RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). After sorting, plates were immediately placed on dry ice and stored at –80 °C. After thawing, which lysed the cells, 10 μl of 2× master mix of the Sensiscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) containing oligo(dT) primer (final concentration 1 μm) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. 10 μl of this reaction was used to amplify the CTR-specific cDNA by PCR, using primers on the 5′ and 3′ sides of exon 13, resulting in different length PCR products amplified from the C1a (356-bp) and Δe13 (308-bp) cDNAs. The forward primer (5′-GATGGCAGCTCTGGTGGTCAAT) corresponded to nucleotides 1190–1211 of the rabbit C1a cDNA, and the reverse primer (5′-GGTGGGCGGGGCGTCTT) corresponded to nucleotides 1529–1545 of the rabbit C1a cDNA (8Shyu J.F. Inoue D. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31127-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The PCR was done in the presence of 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.3 μm each primer by performing 40 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. DNA Constructs—cDNAs encoding the rabbit C1a and Δe13 variants of the CTR were generated by PCR and cloned in the KpnI/HindIII sites of the p3XFLAG-CMV-13 vector (Sigma) to obtain CTRs with a C-terminal 3-fold FLAG tag. The same PCR products were cloned in the KpnI/HindIII site of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to obtain C-terminal GFP-tagged CTR splice variants. The PCR fragments were also cloned in the KpnI/HindIII site of pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech) to obtain C-terminal RFP-tagged CTR splice variants. The GFP constructs were published before and compared with the wild type CTR in respect to ligand binding, phosphorylation after ligand stimulation, and cAMP generation and were found to be indistinguishable (30Seck T. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10408-10416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For this study, we also compared the cellular localization of the GFP- and RFP-tagged CTR constructs with the FLAG-tagged constructs by immunocytochemistry. They were found to be indistinguishable (data not shown). A fragment spanning the complete receptor including the seventh transmembrane domain but lacking the intracellular C-terminal tail of the receptor (amino acids 1–397) was cloned in the KpnI/HindIII site of the pEGFP-N1 vector and designated C1aΔ397-GFP. We also cloned these fragments in the KpnI/HindIII site of the p3XFLAG-CMV-13 vector. Constructs expressing each of the two splice variants with three tandem Myc epitope tags at the C terminus were generated as described before (9Shyu J.F. Zhang Z. Hernandez-Lagunas L. Camerino C. Chen Y. Inoue D. Baron R. Horne W.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All constructs contained an HA tag in the extracellular N terminus of the receptor (after amino acid 29 of the original sequence). We also generated a C-terminally GFP-tagged Δe13 construct containing a Myc tag instead of an HA tag in the extracellular N terminus by mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The ligand binding and cAMP production of all full-length CTR constructs were measured and were found to be indistinguishable from the wild type CTR (data not shown). A fragment spanning the C-terminal tail of the CTR (amino acids 397–474) was cloned between the HindIII and KpnI sites of the p3XFLAG-CMV-13 vector after generation by PCR. A PCR-derived fragment spanning the same region was cloned in the EcoRI/SalI sites of the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate a GST-C-terminal tail fusion protein called GST-C-tail. The C-terminally RFP-tagged V1a vasopressin receptor was a generous gift from Dr. M. Nathanson (Yale University). All PCR-derived constructs were sequenced by the Yale Keck Sequencing Facility. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in mRIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were then centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C, 16,000 × g, the protein concentrations were measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation. 30 μl of protein G-agarose slurry and typically 5 μg of antibody were suspended in 500 μl of PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in mRIPA buffer, and then 500 μg of protein lysate and bovine serum albumin (0.2% w/v) were added, and the mix was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes on the beads were washed four times with washing buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with PBS. Beads were boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE buffer, and samples were electrophoresed on precast 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the transfer was verified by staining with 0.2% Ponceau S in 3% trichloroacetic acid. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes in 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. Membranes were incubated in the primary antibody for 2 h, washed three times for 15 min in TBST, and incubated for 1 h in 1:10,000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system from Amersham Biosciences. Biotinylation of Surface Proteins—Cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS, cooled on ice, and incubated in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min to biotinylate proteins on the cell surface. Excess biotin was quenched by incubating in 50 mm Tris-HCl for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice and harvested in mRIPA buffer. For isolating the cell surface-expressed CTR, biotinylated proteins were bound to 25 μl of resin of immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) by incubating for2hat4 °C in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v). After the incubation, the resin was pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times with immunoprecipitation-washing buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 500 mm NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted by using 100 μl of 1% SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, which was diluted with 900 μl of PBS prior to purifying the CTR by immunoprecipitation. For analysis of receptor surface expression after biotinylation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in mRIPA. The FLAG-tagged CTR was immunoprecipitated using the M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The immune complexes were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The biotinylated receptor was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Experiments— FRET analysis was performed using the C-terminal GFP- and RFP-tagged receptor constructs as described in Ref. 31Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2153-2158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar. HEK 293 cells were seeded in 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, OR) and 24 h later transfected with the GFP- and RFP-tagged CTR constructs as described above. Images were taken by placing the dish in a heated stage (DH-35; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) in a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to maintain a temperature of 37 °C. The culture medium was replaced by 37 °C warm HEPES buffer containing glucose. A 63 × 1.25 numerical aperture water immersion objective was used with the pinhole set to 2.5 Airy disc units. GFP was excited at 488 nm by an argon laser, and RFP was excited at 568 nm using a krypton laser. Emission was measured in the green channel from 505 to 530 nm and in the red channel from 610 to 670 nm. FRET was measured by imaging GFP before and after photobleaching the RFP with the 568-nm krypton laser. An increase of the donor fluorescence (GFP) was interpreted as evidence of FRET from GFP to RFP. An unbleached area of membrane in the same cell served as control. All experiments analyzed at least 10 cells, the mean change of GFP fluorescence was calculated, and statistical analysis of the results was performed by using Student's t test. For time lapse studies, cells were prepared as described above. For the imaging, the excitation energy was lowered to minimize photobleaching and cell damage caused by absorption of light energy. The region of interest was set to membrane areas, and the GFP and RFP fluorescence was measured over the time course, using the same channels as described above. Overexpression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Escherichia coli, strain BL-21, harboring the empty GST vector or GST-C-tail were grown overnight in LB ampicillin medium. The next morning, cells were diluted 1:10 and grown to an A600 of 0.5 and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to express the fusion proteins. After 3 h, cells were harvested by pelleting at 4,000 × g at 4 °C, resuspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated for a total time of 60 s. The bacterial lysate was solubilized by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl. The integrity of the of the GST fusion protein bound to the beads was analyzed by resolving the proteins on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. In Vitro Characterization of C-terminal Domain Interactions—5 μgof GST or GST-C-tail bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 300 μg of total cell lysate of HEK 293 cells transfected with the C1a-GFP or the C1aΔ397-GFP construct. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C with continuous rocking, beads were washed three times with washing buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with PBS. Bound proteins were solubilized in 2× SDS-PAGE buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Measurement of Receptor Cell Surface Expression by FACS Analysis—Cells in six-well plates were incubated with trypsin-EDTA solution at room temperature. All further steps were performed at 4 °C. The trypsin activity was neutralized by the addition of growth medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS. Usually about 3 × 105 cells were used for each experiment. Normal goat IgG was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. After 10 min, the antibody against the N-terminal tag (HA except where otherwise noted) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. A 30-min incubation step was followed by resuspending in 100 μl of PBS containing 50 μg/ml phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After a final washing step, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde to fix the sample. Bound antibody was analyzed by fluorescence flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Win MDI software version 2.8 was used for data analysis. cAMP Measurement—cAMP was measured as described before (8Shyu J.F. Inoue D. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31127-31134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the CTR were plated in a 96-well plate (8,000 cells/well). Cells were preincubated with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 10 min before stimulation with sCT for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 95% ethanol containing 3 mm HCl. cAMP was measured by a scintillation proximity assay (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The Cell Surface Expression Levels of the C1a and the Δe13 Isoform of the Rabbit CTR Differ—The decreased amplitude of the cAMP response previously reported for the Δe13 isoform of the CTR could reflect, at least in part, different levels of cell surface expression of the two isoforms. To examine the subcellular localization of the two isoforms, we first generated C-terminal GFP constructs for the C1a and the Δe13 isoforms and expressed both in HEK 293 cells. Both isoforms showed marked accumulation within the cell (Fig. 1A). Similar intracellular accumulations were found when the CTR isoforms were tagged with the FLAG epitope (data not shown). We previously reported that these accumulations are a recycling compartment for the C1a isoform (30Seck T. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10408-10416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that much less of the Δe13-GFP chimera (Fig. 1A, right panel) was expressed on the cell surface relative to the C1a-GFP chimera (Fig. 1A, left panel). To better quantify the difference in the cell surface expression, we used a flow cytometric method to measure the cell surface expression of the two constructs. An HA tag near the N terminus of the C1a- and Δe13-GFP constructs was used to label the receptors on the cell surface with fluorescent phycoerythrin (PE). FACS analysis showed that whereas the expressions of the two GFP-tagged CTR isoforms were similar (Fig. 1B, upper panels), there was much less PE labeling of the cells expressing the GFP-Δe13 chimera (Fig. 1B, lower panel), indicating that the C1a isoform is much more highly expressed on the cell surface of HEK 293 cells than the Δe13 isoform. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The C1a and the Δe13 Isoform of the Rabbit CTR Form Dimers—To address the question of whether or not the two isoforms of the CTR form homo- or heterodimers, we coexpressed FLAG- and/or GFP-tagged C1a and Δe13 receptors in HEK 293 cells as described in Fig. 2. After immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged CTR, we blotted the immune complexes with the anti-GFP antibody. In all cases, we found that the immune complexes contained both the CTR-FLAG chimera and the CTR-GFP chimera, suggesting that the CTR forms dimers or oligomers (Fig. 2A, upper panel). We found C1a/Δe13 heterodim"

Despite a wealth of structural information on proteinase-single domain inhibitor interactions, the structural basis of inhibition by multidomain proteinase inhibitors remains poorly understood. Here we report the 2.5-Å resolution crystal structure of the two-headed tomato inhibitor-II (TI-II) in complex with two molecules of subtilisin Carlsberg; it reveals how a multidomain inhibitor from the Potato II family of proteinase inhibitors can bind to and simultaneously inhibit two enzyme molecules within a single ternary complex. The N terminus of TI-II initiates the folding of Domain I (Lys-1 to Cys-15 and Pro-84 to Met-123) and then completes Domain II (Ile-26 to Pro-74) before coming back to complete the rest of Domain I (Pro-84 to Met-123). The two domains of TI-II adopt a similar fold and are arranged in an extended configuration that presents two reactive site loops at the opposite ends of the inhibitor molecule. Each subtilisin molecule interacts with a reactive site loop of TI-II through the standard, canonical binding mode. Remarkably, a significant distortion of the active site of subtilisin is induced by the presence of phenylalanine in the P1 position of reactive site loop II of TI-II. The structure of the TI-II·(subtilisin)2 complex provides a molecular framework for understanding how multiple inhibitory domains in a single Potato II type proteinase inhibitor molecule from the Potato II family act to inhibit proteolytic enzymes.

Proteinaceous serine proteinase inhibitors (PIs) 1The abbreviations used are: PI, potato proteinase inhibitor; Pot, potato; TI, tomato proteinase inhibitor; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; BBI, Bowman-Birk proteinase inhibitor. 1The abbreviations used are: PI, potato proteinase inhibitor; Pot, potato; TI, tomato proteinase inhibitor; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; BBI, Bowman-Birk proteinase inhibitor. from plants were first identified nearly 65 years ago (1Read J.W. Haas L.W. Cereal Chem. 1938; 15: 59-68Google Scholar) and are now known to be major constituents of seeds, tubers, and leaves of members of the Solanaceae and Leguminosae families (5–15% of the total protein) (2Richardson M.

These PIs are an integral part of the constitutive and inducible defensive mechanisms that protect plants from attacking pests (bacteria, fungi, and insects) (5Janzen D.H. Rosenthal A. Janzen D.H. Herbivores, Their Interactions with Secondary Plant Metabolites. Academic Press, New York1979: 331-350Google Scholar, 6Ryan C.A. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1990; 28: 425-449Google Scholar, 7Bowles D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 873-907Google Scholar). These defensive mechanisms involve the systemic synthesis of serine PIs that accumulate in distal tissue and can inhibit the digestive trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like enzymes of insects and other related serine proteinases of plant pathogens (8Green T.R. Ryan C.A. Science. 1972; 175: 776-777Google Scholar, 9Johnson R. Narvaez J. An G. Ryan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9871-9875Google Scholar). The inhibitory properties toward serine proteinases of these PIs have already been exploited with varying degrees of success for the production of transgenic plants overexpressing the PIs in an attempt to control pests (9Johnson R.

However, a greater understanding of the molecular mechanism of inhibition of these PIs with pest proteinases is required at the structural level to fully harness the potential benefits of these natural PIs to crop protection.PIs of the Potato II (Pot II) inhibitor family have been isolated from wounded tomato and tobacco leaves (14Plunkett G.

Biophys. 1982; 213: 456-462Google Scholar) and accumulate systemically in plant tissue as a result of wounding or pest attack. The systemic response to attack in the Solanaceae family has been attributed to a complex signaling cascade that is initiated by the binding of systemin (23Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Science. 1991; 253: 895-898Google Scholar) to a cell-surface receptor (24Scheer J.M. Ryan Jr., C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9585-9590Google Scholar) and leads to the release of linolenic acid, which is then converted to 12-oxophytodienoic acid and jasmonic acid (25Li L. Li C. Lee G.I. Howe G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6416-6421Google Scholar). The release of jasmonic acid leads to the activation of several signaling pathways that in turn lead to the production of more jasmonic acid and H2O2 and the synthesis of PIs (26Ryan C.A. Moura D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6519-6520Google Scholar). Within 48 h of insect attack or wounding, PIs can accumulate to levels of 2% or more of the total soluble protein in the leaves of tomato, potato, and alfalfa plants (3Brown W.E. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3418-3422Google Scholar, 27Graham J. Hall G. Pearce G. Ryan C.A.

The wide distribution and inducible expression of Pot II PIs in plants strongly suggest the fundamental importance of these proteins to the pest defense strategies of many commercially important crops.Sequence analyses of various Pot II family PIs have revealed that most are composed of two (10Thornburg R.W.

Tomato proteinase inhibitor II (TI-II) and PI-II each contain two copies of a 54-amino acid repeat, whereas the Nicotiana alata PI is a 40.3-kDa precursor consisting of six repeated elements that are proteolytically processed to yield six different PIs (C1 and C2, which are chymotrypsin inhibitors, and T1–T4, which are trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors) (21Atkinson A.H. Heath R.L. Simpson R.J. Clarke A.E. Anderson M.A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 203-213Google Scholar, 33Heath R.J. Barton P.A. Simpson R.L. Reid G.E. Lim G. Anderson M.A. Eur. J.

High sequence identity exists among the Pot II PI sequences, although interesting variations (mostly in the reactive site loops) occur among different species and among different isoforms of the same species (see Fig. 1). These differences in sequence can give rise to a wide range of differences in cognate proteinase specificities. The expression of multiple isoforms of Pot II PIs with differing target proteinase specificities may be particularly important for protecting plants against predators with an arsenal of proteinases having a wide range of substrate specificity. Understanding the structural basis of PI inhibitory specificity is clearly crucial for understanding how variations in PI sequence give rise to different inhibitory specificities.Few three-dimensional structures are currently available for members of the Potato II inhibitor family, and there is currently only one structure of a complex with a bound proteinase. In 1989, the structure of one of the two domains of PI-II, the chymotrypsin-binding domain (known as PCI-1), was solved to 2.1 Å by x-ray crystallography (35Greenblatt H.M. Ryan C.A. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 201-228Google Scholar) in complex with Streptomyces griseus proteinase B. Remarkably, this structure revealed that the sequence of PCI-I corresponds to a region that lies across the two repeats of inhibitor II instead of being contained within one repeat. As in other inhibitors, the reactive site loop in PCI-I adopts the canonical conformation (36Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Scopus (996) Google Scholar) and is constrained by disulphide bridges Cys-3–Cys-40 and Cys-7–Cys-36, which are invariant in the Pot II family (Fig. 1). The NMR structures of single domains of N. alata have also been determined (34Lee M.C.S. Scanlon M.J. Craik D.J. Anderson M.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 526-530Google Scholar, 37Nielsen K.J. Heath R.L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 231-243Google Scholar, 38Nielsen K.J. Heath R.L. Anderson M.A. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14304-14311Google Scholar). In these single-domain inhibitors, the scaffold of the protein is similar to that seen in PCI-1, and the reactive site loops adopt the same canonical conformation with cysteines involved in disulphide bridge formation at P3 and P2′.Structural information on other families of PIs is mostly restricted to single-domain inhibitors, even though many natural inhibitors have multiple domains. Structures for a multidomain PI bound to a proteinase have only been determined for the two-headed Bowman-Birk inhibitors from mung bean (39Lin G. Bode W. Huber R. Chi C. Engh R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 549-555Google Scholar), soybean (40Koepke J. Ermler U. Warkentin E. Wenzl G. Flecker P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 477-491Google Scholar), and wheat germ (41Raj S.S. Kibushi E. Kurasawa T. Suzuki A. Yamane T. Odani S. Iwasaki Y. Ashida T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 927-933Google Scholar) bound to trypsin. The Bowman-Birk inhibitors consist of two domains of roughly 60 amino acids that are related by a nearly perfect 2-fold rotational symmetry axis. Each inhibitory domain binds to and inhibits a separate proteinase molecule in a very similar manner through a reactive-site loop in the standard, canonical mechanism.For the first time, the three-dimensional x-ray crystallographic structure of a ternary complex of a full-length two-headed inhibitor from the Pot II family, TI-II, bound to two molecules of subtilisin Carlsberg has been solved to 2.5-Å resolution. TI-II is a 13.5-kDa potent inhibitor of subtilisin (Ki = 9 nm) that possesses a remarkable dual specificity toward chymotrypsin (Ki = 30 nm) and trypsin (Ki = 80 nm) (14Plunkett G. Senear D.F. Zuroske G. Ryan C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 463-472Google Scholar). There is high sequence homology between TI-II and PI-II (86% sequence identity), and both inhibitors contain two repeats, each containing one reactive site loop located near the N terminus. Depending on the species, the N-terminal repeat contains the trypsin-specific region, and the C-terminal repeat contains the chymotrypsin-specific region. In the TI-II isoform (from Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Bonny Best) used for our structural studies, the reactive site loop of the first repeat inhibits trypsin (residues P2-P1-P1′ are TRE) whereas that of the second repeat inhibits chymotrypsin (residues P2-P1-P1′ are TFN). The novel three-dimensional structure of TI-II in complex with a bacterial pest proteinase opens avenues of research previously difficult to undertake because of the lack of structural information on the mode of inhibition of two-domain Pot II inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification and Crystallization—Tomato inhibitor-II was prepared from transgenic tomato plants that overexpressed a prosystemin transgene, which resulted in the synthesis and accumulation of high levels of TI-II in the leaves (∼1 mg/ml leaf juice). Leaves from 1000 young tomato plants were collected (∼800 g of leaf tissue) and blended with 1600 ml of a buffer containing 0.01 m sodium citrate, 0.5 m sodium chloride, and 0.7% sodium hydrosulfite, pH 4.3. The homogenate was expressed through eight layers of cheesecloth by hand squeezing, and the debris retained in the cloth was resuspended in 400 ml of buffer, and the mixture was expressed. The combined expressed liquid was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Proteins in the supernatant liquid were precipitated by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation and stirred at 4 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation as above. The pellet was solubilized in 600 ml of water, and the remaining debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting solution was placed in a flask and immersed in a boiling water bath with stirring until the temperature of the liquid was 70 °C. The contents of the flask were then cooled rapidly in an ice bath to room temperature, and the precipitated proteins were repelleted by centrifugation. The solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.01 m Tris, 0.10 m KCl buffer, pH 8.1. The retentate was passed through a 3 × 12-cm column containing chymotrypsin-Sepharose CL4B affinity resin (42Cuatrecasas P. Anfinsen C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 345-378Google Scholar) that had been equilibrated with the buffer. The column was then washed with 3 bed volumes of buffer and then with 8 m urea, pH 3, to elute the inhibitor proteins bound to chymotrypsin. The eluate was dialyzed against several changes of 50 mm ammonium carbonate and lyophilized and stored. The preparation yielded about 80 mg of dry material containing about 24 mg of TI-II and 14 mg of tomato inhibitor-I. TI-II was purified to homogeneity using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. A Vydac (Hesperia, CA) 218TP510 C18 semi-preparative column (10 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) was employed using a 90-min gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. TI-II eluted as a single peak at 53 min. The yields of inhibitor from this step were nearly quantitative. The TI-II protein obtained was homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE.Crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of a 1:1 mixture of TI-II and subtilisin Carlsberg (Sigma) (1 mm each) and 2 μl of 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 200 mm sodium malonate, 75 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 10% (w/v) ethylene glycol, and 5% (v/v) ethanol. Very small crystals grew within 1 to 2 weeks. Macroseeding was used to produce crystals with typical dimensions of 0.2 × 0.1 × ∼0.01 mm. The crystals belonged to space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 154.97 Å, b = 55.10 Å, c = 91.34 Å, α = 90°, β = 119.54°, and γ = 90°.Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—Data were collected on flash-frozen crystals at 100 K by transferring crystals briefly into a cryoprotectant solution identical to the crystallization solution, with the exception of an increased concentration of ethylene glycol (final concentration of 25% (w/v)). After a 3–5-s soaking time, the crystal was transferred directly into a nitrogen gas stream. Data were measured from a MAR 345 detector using 1.08-Å wavelength radiation at beamline 7–1 (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory). Data were recorded as 220 1° oscillations at a crystal-to-detector distance of 220 mm and processed using the HKL suite of programs (43Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). Intensities were converted to amplitudes using TRUNCATE (44Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar).The solvent content of the proteinase·inhibitor complex crystals was calculated to be either 70 or 50% if either one or two copies of subtilisin were present in the asymmetric unit, along with one copy of TI-II. Molecular replacement calculations were carried out using AMoRe (45Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Google Scholar). The structure of subtilisin Carlsberg (PDB code 1SCN), with all the side chains and temperature factors retained, was used as the search model for molecular replacement calculations. Cross-rotation functions calculated using data to a maximum resolution of 3 Å gave two solutions (Patterson correlation coefficients of 0.32 and 0.24). Each rotation function solution was used to calculate a translation function using data to a maximum resolution of 3 Å, yielding two solutions (R-factors of 0.485 and 0.503 after rigid-body refinement). The relative positions of the two subtilisin molecules in the asymmetric unit were determined using a phased translation function, yielding a single solution (R-factor of 0.396). Rotation and translation searches using a search model for either a single domain or both domains of the inhibitor, as constructed from PCI-I (PDB code 4SGB) (35Greenblatt H.M. Ryan C.A. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 201-228Google Scholar), did not reveal any clear solutions.The electron density map calculated using the molecular replacement solutions of the two subtilisin molecules revealed a region of electron density adjacent to the proteinase active sites that had the features expected for TI-II. A search model for a single domain of TI-II was constructed using the coordinates of PCI-I (PDB code 4SGB) (35Greenblatt H.M. Ryan C.A. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 201-228Google Scholar), and two single-domain search models could be placed by manual inspection using the molecular graphics program XFIT (46McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar). Side chains that differed between the PCI-I search model and TI-II were modified, and the model was further adjusted by manual inspection of the electron density map. The model was subjected to iterative rounds of manual model building using XFIT and refinement against a maximum-likelihood target using CNS (47Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Analysis of interdomain and protein-inhibitor interfaces as well as buried surface area calculations were performed using CNS.The final model contains two complete copies of subtilisin and residues 1 to 73 and 86 to 116 of TI-II. Residues 74 to 85 and 117 to 121 of TI-II appear to be disordered, and there was no electron density corresponding to these regions of the structure. 83.6% of residues lie in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues are in disallowed regions (regions defined by PROCHECK) (48Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Google Scholar). Additional checks on geometry were performed using WHATCHECK (49Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E.

Demuth H.U. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10535-10544Google Scholar) (PDB code 1SCN) as the search model. There are two molecules of subtilisin bound to one molecule of the two-headed inhibitor TI-II (see Fig. 2; refer to Table I for crystallographic parameters). The two subtilisin molecules are bound at opposite ends of the elongated inhibitor molecule, forming a 673-residue ternary complex with dimensions of roughly 100 × 50 × 40 Å.TI-II has a novel two-domain structure; each domain adopts the fold described previously in the single-domain Pot II inhibitors (34Lee M.C.S. Scanlon M.J. Craik D.J. Anderson M.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 526-530Google Scholar, 35Greenblatt H.M. Ryan C.A. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 201-228Google Scholar, 37Nielsen K.J.

Each domain contains only a small amount of regular secondary structure in the form of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, as well as a series of stretches of polypeptide chain interconnected by four disulphide bonds. As first predicted after the determination of the structure of the single-domain Pot II inhibitor PCI-I, the sequence repeats present in TI-II do not correspond to individual structural domains (Fig. 1) (35Greenblatt H.M.

https://openalex.org/W1970758033,"The amyloid peptide (Aβ), derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases, undergoes multistage assemblies to fibrillar depositions in the Alzheimer's brains. Aβ protofibrils were previously identified as an intermediate preceding insoluble fibrils. While characterizing a synthetic Aβ variant named EV40 that has mutations in the first two amino acids (D1E/A2V), we discerned unusual aggregation profiles of this variant. In comparison of the fibrillogenesis and cellular toxicity of EV40 to the wild-type Aβ peptide (Aβ40), we found that Aβ40 formed long fibrillar aggregates while EV40 formed only protofibrillar aggregates under the same in vitro incubation conditions. Cellular toxicity assays indicated that EV40 was slightly more toxic than Aβ40 to human neuroblastoma SHEP cells, rat primary cortical, and hippocampal neurons. Like Aβ40, the neurotoxicity of the protofibrillar EV40 could be partially attributed to apoptosis since multiple caspases such as caspase-9 were activated after SHEP cells were challenged with toxic concentrations of EV40. This suggested that apoptosis-induced neuronal loss might occur before extensive depositions of long amyloid fibrils in AD brains. This study has been the first to show that a mutated Aβ peptide formed only protofibrillar species and mutations of the amyloid peptide at the N-terminal side affect the dynamic amyloid fibrillogenesis.

Extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are two typical pathological lesions of AD brains. Amyloid plaques, or neuritic plaques, which are more related to the AD pathogenesis, mainly consist of a cluster of heterogeneous amyloid peptides (Aβ) ranging from 39 to 43 amino acids (1Glenner G.G.

Among these, the Aβ with 40 amino acids (Aβ40) accounts for about 90% while the less soluble C-terminally extended Aβ42 is close to 10%.

Nevertheless, the transmembrane protein presenilin 1 seems indisputably required for the release of the amyloid peptide from its precursor (see reviews in Ref. 14Sisodia S.S. St George-Hyslop P.H.

Pathogenetic studies have manifested that the majority of mutations in APP, presenilin 1, or presenilin 2, identified from the earlyonset familial AD patients, increase either total production of Aβ or the proportion of Aβ42 (reviewed in Ref. 15Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Monomeric Aβ, when the critical concentration is reached, quickly folds into aggregated intermediate species such as oligomeric and protofibrillar forms, and finally, into insoluble fibrillar aggregates (16Koo E.H.

During the optimization of substrates for measuring β-secretase activity in cells, we generated several APP mutants including APPSYEV (K670S/M671Y/D672E/A673V) and APPisyev (V669I/K670S/M671Y/D672E/A673V). Expression of these two constructs in cells showed increased processing of mutant APP at the β-secretase site (31Tomasselli A.G. Qahwash I. Emmons T.L. Lu Y. Leone J.W. Lull J.M. Fok K.F. Bannow C.A. Smith C.W. Bienkowski M.J. Heinrikson R.L. Yan R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1006-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and produced mutated (D1E/A2V) amyloid peptides that we named EV40 and EV42 to distinguish them from the wild-type Aβ40 and Aβ42. By examining the cell culture carefully, we found that stable cell lines expressing high levels of these two APP variants were less healthy than those expressing wild-type or Swedish APP. To understand whether the mutated residues in Aβ would change the properties of amyloid peptides and therefore cause the stress to the cell growth, we examined morphological structures and cellular toxicity of EV40 in comparison to Aβ40. We found that EV40 predominantly formed short, curvy, and sticky protofibrils that were similar to the intermediates of natural Aβ40 fibrils. Furthermore, this form of protofibrils was slightly more toxic to cultured SHEP cells and neurons than Aβ40. The work reported here has been the first to show that the N-terminal sequence of Aβ affected the rate and state of amyloid fibrillogenesis. This may lead to further exploration of the kinetics of amyloid aggregation affected by cellular factors that may potentially interact with the N-terminal end of Aβ. Peptide Synthesis—Amyloid β-(1–40) (Aβ40) was either purchased from Polypeptide Laboratories (Torrance, CA), or together with its mutant, EV40 (D1E/A2V), were synthesized by solid-phase methods employing an Applied Biosystems Model 433A Peptide Synthesizer. Crude peptide was dissolved in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, filtered and loaded onto a preparative reverse phase HPLC column (Vydac C-18, 22 × 250 mm, 10 micron) with a flow rate of 4 ml/min and equilibrated with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water). The column was developed with a linear gradient employing solvents A and B (0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile): 0–10% B over 10 min and then 10–50% B over 100 or 200 min, depending on each individual peptide. The column eluent was monitored by absorbance at 220 and 280 nm. Fractions were monitored on an analytical reverse phase system (Vydac C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 micron); solvents and conditions were as above. A linear gradient from 0–70% B over 20 min at 1.0 ml/min was employed for this purpose. The chemical authenticity of each peptide was established by mass spectrometry employing a Micromass Platform II mass spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett Packard Series 1050 HPLC system. The identity of the peptide was confirmed by injecting 5 μl of sample into the flow of 100 μl/min of 1:1 methanol/water. The mass spectrometer was operated in electrospray ionization mode with needle voltage 3 kV, temperature 120 °C, and cone voltage 30 V. The identity of the each peptide was confirmed by amino acid sequencing of the synthetic peptides. Turbidity Assays of Amyloid Aggregation—Turbidity assays were carried out as previously described (32Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Briefly,a1mm stock was made by dissolving the peptide in 0.22-μm filter-sterilized 0.1% acetic acid then diluted 1:20 in calcium and magnesium-free Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline to a final concentration of 50 μm. Aliquots of the peptide solutions (250 μl) were transferred to wells of Corning 96-well tissue culture plates, and the wells were tightly sealed with an adhesive sealer. The plates were constantly shaken at 800 oscillations/min on a Titer Plate Shaker (Lab-Line Instruments, Inc., Melrose Park, IL) to induce aggregation. Monitoring the aggregation process was accomplished by measuring the optical density of each well at 405 nm using a ThermoMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Electron Microscopy—Peptide solutions were prepared the same as for the turbidity assay to a final concentration of 50 μm. Peptide solutions were incubated at 37 °C for indicated times, and 5 μl of each sample was then applied onto formvar-coated copper grids (200 mesh) and negatively stained with 5 μl of 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. Samples were viewed in a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV accelerating voltage. Film images were captured on Kodak Electron Microscope film, and the negatives were developed and printed at an enlargement of ×2.5. Digital images were captured as TIFF files by a 1 megapixel Gatan Bioscan digital camera (model 792). Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—Peptides were prepared by dissolving them in 0.22-μm filter-sterilized 0.1% acetic acid at 1 mm, the resulting solutions were then diluted 1:10 in 50 mm 0.2 μm filtered sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 to a final concentration of 100 μm. Peptides were incubated at 37 °C for indicated times and aliquots of the peptide solutions (200 μl) were transferred to a quartz cell with a pathlength of 0.1 cm. Spectra were acquired using a Jasco (Easton, MD) J-715 spectrophotometer at 23 °C. The CD spectra were collected from 200–260 nm with a response of 0.25 s, scan speed of 100 nm/min, resolution of 1.0 nm and 32 cumulative scans. Secondary structures were estimated from the spectra using a principal component regression analysis method similar to one previously described (33Hennessey Jr., J.P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), except β-turn structures were grouped together in the analysis and only 4 eigenvectors were used since the data did not extend to 178 nm. Error in the analysis of the basis spectra was within 5%. Stock solutions of both peptides were also prepared by dissolving the peptides directly in water at a concentration of 200 μm. These solutions were sampled immediately after preparation and after incubation at 37 °C for 72 h. Samples (15 μL) were transferred to a quartz cell with a pathlength of 0.01 cm, and CD spectra were acquired using the previous parameters except the data were collected from 184 to 260 nm and smoothed with a 13 point smoothing function. All CD spectra were converted to mean residue ellipticities for comparison. Cell Culture—Human SHEP cells are a cell line cloned from the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH that was established in 1970 from a metastatic bone tumor. SHEP cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2-controlled atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Preparation of Rat Primary Neurons—E18 pregnant rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratory and were anesthetized with halothane prior to cervical dislocation. Aseptically, embryos were removed and immersed in the dissociation media (Hibernate E supplemented with B27, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units of penicillin/streptomycin). Embryo heads were cut away into a fresh 10-cm dish with dissociation medium. Overlying cartilage was dissected away, and the brains were moved to a fresh plate containing dissociation medium. Meninges and subcortical tissues were removed with fine forceps. Hippocampi and cortices were dissected and placed into 0.22 μm filter-sterilized 10 mg/ml papain/Hibernate solutions for 30 min at 35 °C with gentle agitation. Tissue was then washed twice with warm dissociation media and dispersed into a single cell suspension by gentle trituration through a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Cells were counted on a Coulter Counter® ZM (Coulter Electronics, Luton Beds, England) and viability was determined by Trypan Blue exclusion. Cells were diluted in growth media (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 33 mm glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, B27, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate) and 1 × 105 cells/well were plated into poly-d-lysine coated 96-well tissue culture plates. On the fourth day of culture, half of the medium was replaced with growth media supplemented with aphidicolon to a final concentration of 3.3 μg/ml for 24 h after which the medium was replaced with growth media. Treatments were administered between days 12 and 14 in culture. Cellular Toxicity Assays—Cytotoxicity was quantified by assays based on penetration of Sytox Green Nucleic acid fluorescent stains into the damaged plasma membrane (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cell culture plates were centrifuged at 250 × g for 4 min. An aliquot of 50 μl of medium was removed from each well and replaced with 50 μl of a 2 μm Sytox Green solution, prepared by diluting the 5 mm stock in Me2SOwith phenol red-free Opti-MEM I or phenol red-free DMEM for SHEP cells or primary neurons, respectively. The plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and read on a Tecan Spectrafluor Plus plate reader exciting at 485 nm and emitting at 535 nm. Alternatively, cellular toxicity was also determined by LDH assay (Promega, Madison, WI), measuring the release of the cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase at 492 nm. Western Blot Analysis of Caspase Activation—Following amyloid challenge, cells were harvested and lysed in MAPK lysis buffer on ice (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm molybdic acid, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris, and nuclei and cell lysates were then quantified based on protein concentrations. Equivalent protein samples, representing ∼7 × 104 cells, were electrophoresed on 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane for Western analysis (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Processing/activation of caspases was evaluated by incubating with anti-actin antibody (0.5 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-caspase-9 (1:1000 dilution, PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West PICO reagent (Pierce). EV40 Displayed Different Aggregative Profiles from Aβ40 Based on Turbidimetric Assays—Aβ fibrillogenesis is a multistep process involving nucleation, elongation, and aggregation. The kinetics of Aβ fibrillogenesis has been previously monitored by various approaches including turbidimetry (32Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). To gain a quick assessment of the EV40 aggregation, we compared kinetic aggregation profiles of EV40 to Aβ40 by turbidimetric assays. As shown in Fig. 1, after a short duration of lag phase (∼40 min) under constantly controlled shaking, Aβ40 solutions quickly became turbid. The peak of the turbidity, which reflects larger aggregation of the testing peptide, was reached at about 180-min postinitiation of shaking. Nevertheless, turbidity in the wells containing EV40 increased at a much slower rate (Fig. 1), suggesting that these two peptides aggregated with distinct kinetics of nucleation and oligomerization. At 360-min postinitiation of shaking, the maximum turbidity of the EV40-containing wells was significantly less than that of the Aβ40 containing wells. This observation implicated that both peptides had distinct aggregation rates, and, therefore, prompted us to examine the properties of EV40 more carefully. EV40 Predominantly Formed Protofibrils While Aβ40 Assembled to Long Fibrils—The morphology of Aβ fibrils has been well documented by the approaches of electron microscopy, atomic-force microscopy, etc. Since EV40 had a much slower aggregation rate based on the turbidimetric assays, we suspected that the biophysical parameters of EV40 might be different from Aβ40. To address this, we compared the morphological structures of these two peptides in parallel by electron microscopy. In our initial experiment, we allowed the peptides to aggregate at 37 °C for 48 h followed by examining the fibrillar formation. Under these conditions, Aβ40 formed long, rigid, and extended fibrils ∼5–10 nm in diameter that could be longer than 500 nm in length (Fig. 2A), consistent with the observations summarized previously (17Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 38: 8972-8980Crossref Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, EV40 did not form long and rigid fibrils as seen in the Aβ40 preparations (comparing Fig. 2, A with B). Instead, the morphological structures found in the EV40 preparations were short and curvy with ∼5 nm in diameter (Fig. 2B), and ring-like structures were evident. Frequently, these short protofibrils tended to associate with each other, but did not assemble into long fibrils. In general, the morphological structure of EV40 was similar to that of the Aβ protofibrils, identified as an intermediate that will progress to long and straight fibrils after longer incubation (17Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 38: 8972-8980Crossref Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 34Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The EM morphology of EV40 also resembled the short protofibrils reported for a sample of Aβ40 in the presence of apomorphine (35Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M Balakhaneh D. Aggarwal A. Teichberg S. Callaway D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42881-42890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, EV40 seemed to form an aggregated structure resembling the intermediate protofibrillar aggregates of natural Aβ40. We then conducted more careful studies focusing on the dynamic protofibrillar progression of EV40 and Aβ40. Without incubation at 37 °C, no identifiable protofibrils or long fibrils were observed from freshly dissolved and negatively stained Aβ40 (Fig. 2C). Occasionally, we noticed a bead-like structure in freshly dissolved Aβ40 (similar to that seen in the background of Fig. 2A). It is unclear whether it is related to the low molecular weight (LMW) oligomers of Aβ. On the contrary, EV40 formed smaller protofibrils (<100 nm in length) even without intentional incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2D). If incubated for4hat 37 °C, Aβ40 proceeded to form short and irregular protofibrils (Fig. 2E), consistent with prior observations (17Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 38: 8972-8980Crossref Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 30Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Incubation of the EV40 solution at 37 °C for 4 h would allow short protofibrillar EV40 to grow into longer protofibrils (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, even being incubated up to 8 days at 37 °C, EV40 still formed curvy protofibrillar aggregates and never formed long and straight fibrils (shown in Fig. 2G) while Aβ40 typically formed rigid fibrils after incubation for about 48 h (Fig. 2A). It appeared that EV40 had a very short duration of nucleation and oligomerization, but quickly locked into the protofibrillar state during prolonged incubation. Since synthetic peptides have been shown to have slight biophysical variations in batch-to-batch preparations, we repeated electron microscopy experiments using three different batches of EV40 to verify the above results. Again, we observed similar protofibrillar patterns using various batches of EV40, suggesting that the protofibrillar form of EV40 was not due to an unusual synthesis of this peptide. Aβ40 always produced fibrillar aggregates no matter whether Aβ40 peptide was purchased from a commercial source or synthesized in house employing the same preparative procedures for producing EV40. The Aggregative Progression Conformation of EV40 and Aβ40 by Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—To determine the biophysical natures of Aβ40 and EV40 peptides, we employed circular dichroism to monitor the structural transition of these two peptides during aggregation. A solution of freshly prepared Aβ40-contained peptide in a mostly random coil and antiparallel β-sheet conformation as determined by principal component analysis of the CD spectrum, 47% random coil, 21% β-turns, 31% antiparallel β-sheet, <5% parallel β-sheet, and α-helical structure. Little change in the CD spectrum of the solution was detected for 2 h at room temperature but incubation at 37 °C for 24 h resulted in slightly greater negative ellipticity at 215–230 nm as shown in Fig. 3A. Incubation for another 24 h produced additional spectral alterations consistent with increased antiparallel β-sheet. Unlike Aβ40, a freshly prepared solution of EV40 showed little conformational change for 72 h at 37 °C (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the CD spectra of EV40 were also very similar to the spectrum of Aβ40 collected after 24 h at 37 °C. Similar conformation of EV40 with that of a protofibrillar aggregate of Aβ40 was consistent with the electron microscopy observations suggesting that EV40 formed an aggregated structure similar to the intermediate protofibrillar aggregates of Aβ40. A comparison of CD spectra for Aβ40 and EV40 dissolved in water at 200 μm is shown in Fig. 3C. Initial spectra and spectra collected after 72 h incubation at 37 °C are shown. Using a shorter pathlength than used for the previous experiments, spectral data could be collected to lower wavelengths for these solutions that did not contain acetic acid or Me2SO that absorb at lower wavelengths. The same trend was evident as was detected at lower peptide concentrations. A large reduction in random coil with concomitant increase in β-sheet conformation was detected for Aβ40 upon incubation and although there was less random coil conformation in EV40 initially, there was less change in conformation after incubation. EV40 contained more β-sheet structure than AB40 initially as indicated by the ratio of ellipticities at 208 compared with 215 nm. Again, this is consistent with the other data that indicates EV40 forms protofibrils soon after dissolution but then undergoes a delay in elongated fibril formation. EV40 Suppresses Fibrillation of Aβ40—Growth of Aβ40 fibrils can be affected by the presence of various reagents including short peptides (35Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M Balakhaneh D. Aggarwal A.

To elucidate the differential impact of the N-terminal myristoylation as well as occupation of the two Ca2+ binding sites on recoverin structure and function, we have investigated a non-myristoylated E85Q mutant exhibiting virtually no Ca2+ binding to EF-2. Crystal structures of the mutant protein as well as the non-myristoylated wild-type have been determined. Although the non-myristoylated E85Q mutant does not display any functional activity, its three-dimensional structure in the presence of Ca2+ resembles the myristoylated wild-type with two Ca2+ but is quite dissimilar from the myristoylated E85Q mutant. We conclude that the N-terminal myristoyl modification significantly stabilizes the conformation of the Ca2+-free protein (i.e. the T conformation) during the stepwise transition toward the fully Ca2+-occupied state. On the basis of these observations, a refined model for the role of the myristoyl group as an intrinsic allosteric modulator is proposed.

In this state, recoverin is able to inhibit the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK1 1The abbreviations used are: GRK, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; GCAP, guanylate cyclase activating protein; myr-, myristoylated; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Rec, wild-type recoverin; Rec[E85Q], recoverin with E85Q substitution; Rec * 1 Ca, recoverin with Ca2+ bound to EF-3; Rec * 2 Ca, recoverin with Ca2+ bound to EF-2 and EF-3; ROS, rod outer segments; r.m.s., root mean square.

A. 1998; 95: 6474-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Upon illumination, decrease of cytoplasmic Ca2+ causes this inhibition to be relieved. This regulatory circuit is thought to be one out of several Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that control adaptation of phototransduction to changing background light intensities (13Pugh Jr., E.N. Nikonov S. Lamb T.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 14Burns M.E. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 779-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). At its N terminus recoverin is heterogeneously acylated, the prevailing modification being a myristoyl chain (15Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16033-16036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation of a Ca2+-dependent partitioning of recoverin to membranes led to the proposal that it underwent a Ca2+-myristoyl switch (16Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The mechanics of this switch were unraveled by determining the solution structures of Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound myristoylated recoverin via NMR spectroscopy. In the Ca2+-free state of recoverin (T state) the myristoyl moiety is buried within a hydrophobic pocket, whereas in the Ca2+-bound form (R state), the acyl group is extruded and thus available for interaction with other proteins or insertion into a lipid bilayer (17Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30909-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 19Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Moreover, the myristoyl chain has been proposed to act as an intrinsic allosteric effector modifying the conformational equilibrium between T and R states (20Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binds to recoverin in a sequential fashion, i.e. occupation of high affinity EF-hand 3 is followed by filling of low affinity EF-hand 2. An intermediate state with Ca2+ bound solely to EF-3 can be prepared using myristoylated recoverin harboring the mutation E85Q, which virtually abolishes Ca2+ binding to EF-hand 2. Recently the three-dimensional structure of the myristoylated E85Q mutant was determined by NMR spectroscopy (21Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was shown to exhibit a hybrid fold with the N- and C-terminal domains resembling the corresponding portions of Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound myristoylated wild-type recoverin, respectively. Consequently, the myristoyl group is still sequestered within a hydrophobic cavity and only partially unclamped. Biochemical studies on the myristoylated E85Q mutant confirmed that it can only bind one Ca2+ at saturating concentration (21Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a fraction of myristoylated E85Q recoverin binds to membranes already at low free Ca2+ (2–9 μM), indicating that the presence of lipid bilayers may shift the conformational equilibrium toward a form of the E85Q mutant in which the myristoyl chain is exposed (22Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The presence of the N-terminal acyl group lowers the apparent Ca2+ affinity and adds cooperativity to the Ca2+ binding mode of recoverin (6Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because in the Ca2+-saturated R state the myristoyl group is exposed to the solvent, the x-ray structure of non-myristoylated recoverin in the presence of Ca2+ has been suggested to represent a good approximation to the R form of the myristoylated protein (23Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 24Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that the non-myristoylated E85Q mutant may represent a model of the myristoylated analog in the presence of membranes. Despite the lack of evidence for involvement of nonacylated recoverin in signal transduction, non-myristoylated forms of the protein are valuable models to delineate the pathways of Ca2+-induced conformational changes. In the present study we address the impact of the myristoyl group on the Ca2+-dependent conformational transition in recoverin. To this end, we have determined the x-ray structure of the non-myristoylated E85Q mutant and compared it to the non-myristoylated wild-type as well as to the myristoylated mutant published recently (21Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to gain more insight into the biochemical properties of the non-acylated E85Q variant, we investigated key functional parameters such as Ca2+ binding, association with hydrophobic matrices, and inhibition of rhodopsin kinase. Finally we asked how the biochemical properties of the E85Q mutant correlate with the structural information that we obtained on this mutant. Preparation of Wild-type Recoverin, Mutant E85Q Recoverin, and Rhodopsin Kinase—Preparation of recombinant non-myristoylated forms of wild-type and mutant recoverin has been described previously (22Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The purification of rhodopsin kinase was performed by a modification of a published procedure (25Dean K.R. Akhtar M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6164-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Bovine rod outer segments (ROS, 100–200 mg of rhodopsin) were homogenized in low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)), illuminated at 4 °C for 10 min by a 150-watt white light source, and then ROS membranes were pelleted. Rhodopsin kinase activity was extracted from ROS membranes by washing three times in 10–15 ml of high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) in the dark. The combined extract containing rhodopsin kinase activity was diluted with salt-free buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) to a final concentration of 125 mm NaCl and was loaded onto a heparin-agarose column. After a washing step with two bed volumes of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) rhodopsin kinase was eluted with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 280 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. The fractions containing rhodopsin kinase activity were combined, diluted with salt-free buffer to yield 100 mm NaCl, and applied to a Mono-Q (5/5) column. Rhodopsin kinase activity was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. All procedures were performed at 0–4 °C. The specific activity of purified rhodopsin kinase was 10–19 units/ml, with 1 unit being defined as the activity that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of 32P per minute into light-activated rhodopsin (25Dean K.R. Akhtar M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6164-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 45Ca2+ Binding Assay—Binding of 45Ca2+ to wild-type recoverin and the E85Q mutant was investigated as described previously (21Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In summary, 50 or 100 μm protein was dissolved in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT and transferred to Centricon 10 devices (Amicon). Radioactive 45CaCl2 was added, the samples were centrifuged for 1 min (7000 rpm, tabletop centrifuge Eppendorf model 5415), and radioactivity of the filtrate was counted (free Ca2+). Next, non-radioactive CaCl2 was added and the centrifugation procedure was repeated. Protein-bound Ca2+ versus free Ca2+ was determined from the excess Ca2+ in the protein sample over that present in the ultrafiltrate. Data were analyzed as described previously (22Senin I.I. Fischer T. Komolov K.E. Zinchenko D.V. Philippov P.P. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50365-50372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Phenyl-agarose Binding Assay—The phenyl-agarose binding assay was performed according to a published procedure (16Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μm wild-type recoverin or mutant E85Q were mixed with 100 μl phenyl-agarose (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C (Eppendorf thermomixer 5436, 1,000 rpm) for 15 min in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2,1mm DTT, 3 mm EGTA, and 0–50 mm CaCl2 (total volume, 1000 μl). The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min (14,000 rpm, table-top centrifuge Eppendorf model 5415), and protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Rhodopsin Kinase Assay—The assay mixture in a final volume of 50 μl contained 10 μm rhodopsin (urea-washed ROS), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm [γ-32P]ATP (30–100 dpm/pmol), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.3 unit of rhodopsin kinase. Where appropriate, wild-type recoverin or the E85Q mutant and a Ca2+/bisaminobromophenoxyethane tetraacetate buffer were added (20Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP, and samples were incubated in continuous light for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubation was terminated by adding 1 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed 3–4 times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid; the pellet was used for Cerenkov counting. Recoverin Crystallization—Non-myristoylated recombinant bovine recoverin was crystallized using the hanging-drop setup in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2,and1mm MgCl2 with the reservoir solution additionally containing 70–80% saturated ammonium sulfate. Crystals measuring 150–250 μm in each dimension grew within 4–6 weeks under these conditions. Data Collection—Crystallographic datasets were collected at 100 K. Because crystals could not be grown in the presence of cryoprotectants, they were soaked in reservoir solution containing 5, 10, and 15% (v/v) glycerol for 10 min each and 30% for 10 s prior to cryocooling. Native data were recorded at beamline ID14-1 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) tuned to a wavelength of 0.934 Å on an ADSC-Q4R detector (ADSC-Quantum). Data processing, including reflections up to 1.5- and 1.9-Å resolution for wild-type and mutant, respectively, was carried out using MOSFLM (26.Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, No. 26Google Scholar) and SCALA, the latter of which is part of the CCP4 software suite (27Collaborative computational project, n. 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Structure Solution—Both recoverin structures were determined by molecular replacement using a single dataset each. The crystal structure of non-myristoylated recombinant bovine recoverin reported previously (23Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was used as a starting model for refinement of the wild-type structure. Following preliminary refinement using the CNS software package (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), all regions poorly defined in electron density were removed from the model and re-established in an iterative process, including several cycles of positional refinement and manual rebuilding using the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). To minimize model bias in the refinement process, electron density was modified using the DM package (CCP4), including solvent flattening, histogram mapping, and Sayre's equation. This finally allowed for portions of the structure not well-defined in 2Fo–Fc maps (i.e. residues 2–6 and 201–202) to be built as well. A total of 85 crystallographic water molecules could be determined in the structure. The resulting improved wild-type recoverin model served as a starting point for determination of the E85Q mutant structure, which was performed using essentially the same strategy. In this case, residues 2–6, 75–77, and 198–202 could not be properly defined even by the use of density modification algorithms. The number of water molecules in this structure was 76.

Open table in a new tab According to Ramachandran plots generated with PROCHECK (CCP4), both models exhibit good geometry with 98.4 and 100%, respectively, of the residues in the allowed regions. Exceptions in the wild-type structure include serines 4 and 6 located in the N-terminal tail poorly defined in the 2Fo–Fc map and aspartate 74, which is part of the Ca2+ binding EF-2 loop. Figures were generated using MOL-SCRIPT (30Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (31Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar) using secondary structure assignments as given by the DSSP program (32Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12333) Google Scholar). Surface representations were prepared with VMD (33Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39017) Google Scholar). For depicting solution structures determined by NMR spectroscopy the individual structure exhibiting the lowest r.m.s. deviation from the mean, as determined with MOLMOL (34Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar), was selected from the ensemble. Calculation of EF-hand interhelical angles was performed using the program INTERHLX (obtained from nmr.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ikura/datasoft.html). Ca2+ Binding Properties of Recoverin Variants—To assess the functional activity of non-myristoylated E85Q mutant recoverin, we first investigated its ability to bind radioactive 45Ca2+ (Fig. 1). One Ca2+ ion is bound to the mutant protein with an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 0.26 μm, and binding is saturated above 10 μm. These observations are in agreement with data reported recently (KD = 0.15 μm (21Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). To assure our method worked properly, we repeated measurements on non-acylated wild-type recoverin as a control showing that it binds two Ca2+ non-cooperatively with an apparent KD of 0.21 and 6.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 1). Our results confirmed previous observations indicating that EF-hand 3 is the high affinity Ca2+ binding site in recoverin, irrespective of the myristoylation state (6Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interaction with Phenyl-agarose—Binding of recoverin to phenyl-agarose is thought to depend on the Ca2+-induced exposure of hydrophobic residues and not on the presence of the myristoyl group (16Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We applied this assay to test whether the non-myristoylated E85Q variant could bind to phenyl-agarose in a fashion similar to the wild-type (Fig. 2). In fact, the mutant protein did not display any binding activity at all. By contrast, wild-type recoverin included as a control bound to the hydrophobic matrix with half-saturation occurring at 1.5 μm Ca2+. Inhibition of Rhodopsin Kinase—One more characteristic feature of recoverin is its capability of inhibiting rhodopsin kinase in a Ca2+-dependent manner (9Kawamura S. Hisatomi O. Kayada S. Tokunaga F. Kuo C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14579-14582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 11Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16147-16152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Gorodovikova E.N. Gimelbrant A.A. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Gorodovikova E.N. Senin I.I. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Myristoylation of recoverin is dispensable for this activity, because the non-acylated protein inhibits rhodopsin kinase in a manner very similar to the myristoylated form (37Senin I.I. Zargarov A.A. Alekseev A.M. Gorodovikova E.N. Lipkin V.M. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that calcium triggers exposure of an interaction site that mediates inhibition of GRK1 by recoverin and is different from its N-terminal myristoyl group. We tested whether the mutant could inhibit rhodopsin kinase in a Ca2+-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 3, the E85Q mutant was not capable of inhibiting GRK1 to a significant extent. In contrast, the nonmyristoylated wild-type used as a positive control inhibited rhodopsin kinase as expected. Crystal Structure of Wild-type Recoverin and the E85Q Mutant—For elucidating the role of the myristoyl modification as an intrinsic modulator of the Ca2+-induced conformational transition in recoverin, structural studies on non-myristoylated analogs are particularly useful. As a first approach, to establish a positive control system, we have re-investigated the crystallographic structure of recombinant non-myristoylated bovine recoverin to a higher resolution (1.5 Å) than has been described previously (1.9 Å (23Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). As a result, we were able to trace backbone and side-chain density in a larger portion of the molecule, particularly in the N- and C-terminal parts and the EF-2 loop. In the extreme termini (residues 2–6 and 201–202), use of conventional 2Fo–Fc and Fo–Fc maps did not allow for satisfactory density allocation. However, based on density modification strategies, tentative coordinates are included for these stretches as well. The overall fold of the molecule is mostly identical to the published structure with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.45 Å for main-chain atoms and 1.03 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms. Likewise, the EF-2 Ca2+ binding site was found to be unoccupied despite the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ in the crystallization mother liquor. This is probably due to the high concentration of ammonium sulfate (approx. 3 m) in the solution, because it is well established that high ionic strength leads to electrostatic screening of ionic binding sites. Thus the Ca2+ activity is decreased into a range supporting binding to the high affinity EF-3 but not to the low affinity EF-2 site. Moreover, a model calculation of free Ca2+ in the presence of 3 m sulfate lead to an estimate well below 1 μm, which is clearly insufficient for Ca2+ binding to EF-2. The absence of Ca2+ in EF-2 in the crystal structures should therefore be viewed as a reflection of the ion concentrations in the samples and not an indication of an artifact due to crystal packing interactions. Although the non-liganded EF-2 loop is quite well defined in our crystal structure (mean atomic B factor 22.4 Å2 for residues 72–82 compared with 21.7 Å2 for the entire structure), we cannot exclude that it exhibits increased flexibility in solution. Using crystallization conditions similar to those for the wild-type protein, crystals of the E85Q mutant diffracting to 1.9 Å were obtained. In this case, the entire polypeptide chain could be traced with the exception of residues 2–6, 75–77, and 198–202, which are poorly defined in electron density. The overall fold of the mutant protein turned out to be very similar to our wild-type structure with an r.m.s. deviation over the portions well-defined in both structures (residues 7–74 and 78–197) of 0.30 Å for main-chain atoms and 0.65 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms. This similarity is not surprising, because even the crystal structure of wild-type recoverin does not show any Ca2+ binding to EF-hand 2 (see above), which is disabled in the E85Q mutant. As has already been noted for the wild-type crystal structure, this fold is quite similar to the solution structure of the myristoylated protein with two Ca2+ bound (19Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T.

During the course of the present study, an NMR structure of the myristoylated E85Q mutant was published (21Ames J.B. Hamasaki N. Molchanova T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5776-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, there are striking differences between the two structures of E85Q (Fig. 4). 2Comparative structural representations included in this report display crystallographic structures along with NMR structures. We are aware of the possibility of artifacts, e.g. due to crystal packing interactions (38Srivastava D.K. Bernhard S.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

However, due to the large extent of the majority of structural differences we refer to, we are confident that the conclusions drawn are nonetheless significant.

https://openalex.org/W1968436647,"The function of membrane proteins is inextricably linked to the proper packing and assembly of their independently helical transmembrane (TM) segments. Here we examined whether an externally added TM peptide analogue could specifically inhibit the function of the membrane protein from which it is derived by competing for native TM helix packing sites, thereby producing a non-functional peptide-protein complex. This hypothesis was tested using Lys-tagged peptides synthesized with sequences corresponding to the three TM segments of the homotrimeric Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (DGK). The peptide corresponding to wild-type DGK TM-2 inhibited the protein's enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner through formation of an inactive pseudo-complex, whereas peptides derived from TM-1 and TM-3 were benign toward DGK structure/function. Also, substitution of a conserved residue (Glu-69) within the TM-2 peptide abolished these effects, demonstrating the strict sequence requirements for TM-2-mediated association. This strategy, coupled with the practical advantages of the water solubility of Lys-tagged TM peptides, may constitute an attractive approach for the design of therapeutic membrane protein modulators even in the absence of a high resolution structure."
https://openalex.org/W2094516247,"α-Amino acid ester hydrolases (AEHs) catalyze the hydrolysis and synthesis of esters and amides with an α-amino group. As such, they can synthesize β-lactam antibiotics from acyl compounds and β-lactam nuclei obtained from the hydrolysis of natural antibiotics. This article describes the gene sequence and the 1.9-A resolution crystal structure of the AEH from Xanthomonas citri. The enzyme consists of an α/β-hydrolase fold domain, a helical cap domain, and a jellyroll β-domain. Structural homology was observed to the Rhodococcus cocaine esterase, indicating that both enzymes belong to the same class of bacterial hydrolases. Docking of a β-lactam antibiotic in the active site explains the substrate specificity, specifically the necessity of an α-amino group on the substrate, and explains the low specificity toward the β-lactam nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2033673797,"Cre initiates recombination by preferentially exchanging the bottom strands of the loxP site to form a Holliday intermediate, which is then resolved on the top strands. We previously found that the scissile AT and GC base pairs immediately 5′ to the scissile phosphodiester bonds are critical in determining this order of strand exchange. We report here that the scissile base pairs also influence the Cre-induced DNA bends, the position of which correlates with the initial site of strand exchange. The binding of one Cre molecule to a loxP site induces a ∼35° asymmetric bend adjacent to the scissile GC base pair. The binding of two Cre molecules to a loxP site induces a ∼55° asymmetric bend near the center of the spacer region with a slight bias toward the scissile A. Lys-86, which contacts the scissile nucleotides, is important for establishing the bend near the scissile GC base pair when one Cre molecule is bound but has little role in positioning the bend when two Cre molecules are bound to a loxP site.

In this report we have further characterized the roles of the scissile base pairs and the Lys-86 residue in the Cre-induced DNA bending to better understand the basis for the order of strand exchange. We find that Cre induces asymmetric bends in the loxP site, and the position of the bends is dictated by the scissile base pairs: the binding of one Cre molecule (complex I, cI) 1The abbreviations used are: cI, complex I; cII, complex II; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; OP-Cu, 1,10-phenanthroline-copper; Wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: cI, complex I; cII, complex II; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; OP-Cu, 1,10-phenanthroline-copper; Wt, wild type. induces a bend near the margin of the spacer region adjacent to the scissile G nucleotide, whereas the binding of two Cre molecules (complex II, cII) induces a bend near the center of the spacer region with a slight bias toward the scissile A (see Fig. 1, b and c). Lys-86 has a role in positioning the Cre-induced bend in the loxP cI, but not in the loxP cII. Changes in the Cre-induced DNA bends within cII correlate with the site of initial strand exchange as originally proposed by Guo et al. (25Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The circularly permuted DNA substrates were obtained by digestion of the plasmid with EcoRV, SmaI, NruI, SspI, BamHI, MluI, BglII, NheI, and SpeI, and isolation of the 162-bp digested fragments.The phasing plasmids were constructed by excising the 156-bp BamHI-BamHI DNA fragment from the plasmids pK10, pK12, pK14, pK16, pK18, and pK20 (35Zinkel S.S.

Constructs containing the lox site inserted in the forward and reverse orientations were isolated. Phasing substrates were obtained by isolating the 347- to 357-bp RsaI-PvuII fragments. The loxSA site introduced a novel RsaI site in the symmetric spacer region and so the loxSA phasing substrates were obtained by PCR using the primers RsaI2959F (5′-ACATATTGTCGTTAGAACGCG-3′) and PvuII270R (5′-CTGGCTTATCGAAATTAATAC-3′). ∼0.2 μg of the loxSA phasing plasmid was amplified in 50 μl of 3 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm of each dNTPs, 1 mm of each primers, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) for 35 PCR cycles of heating at 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min.

The peak intensity of each band was expressed relative to the total intensity in the lane and then normalized to the relative intensity of the band corresponding to nucleotide “25 G” on the top strand or “19′ G” on the bottom strand (Fig. 2, a and b). The extent of protection or enhancement was calculated as a ratio of the normalized relative band intensities in the presence or absence of Cre (+ to – Cre ratio).Fig. 2DMS methylation protection of loxP and lox4 by wild type and K86A Cre proteins. A 82-bp DNA (S82) containing either the loxP site (lanes 1–4)orthe lox4 site (lanes 5–8) was 5′-radioactively labeled on the top strand (a) or the bottom strand (b).2nm DNA was incubated without (lanes 1 and 5) or with 0.5 μm of wild type (Wt), His-tagged wild type (HisWt) or HisK86A Cre protein, then treated with DMS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DMS-treated DNA was cleaved at methylated G and A residues with alkali and analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Representative autoradiograms are shown. The loxP sequence corresponding to the cleaved bands are indicated to the left of the audioradiogram. The residues mutated to create lox4 are indicated in parentheses. The symmetry elements (normal type) are represented by vertical arrows, and the spacer region (boldface type)is boxed with the small arrow denoting the cleavage site. The band intensities were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average ratios (from at least three experiments) of the normalized band intensities in the presence to absence of Cre (+ to – Cre ratio) are represented graphically on a log scale to the right of the autoradiogram. The nucleotides are numbered from the center of the lox site as shown in Fig. 1b, with the nucleotides in the spacer in boldface type and the flanking non-lox sequences in lowercase. The dotted vertical lines indicate 1.5-fold protection or enhancement (hypermethylation).

Sites of protection (green diamonds) and enhancement (yellow triangles) greater than 1.5-fold are indicated. Although the scissile G at position 4′ in lox4 was protected by wild type Cre by slightly less than 1.5-fold, the protection was reproducible.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)OP-Cu Footprinting—2nm S82 substrate (5′-32P labeled on either the top or the bottom strand) was incubated with 1 μm Cre in 20 μl of Cre reaction buffer (32Lee L. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature. The OP-Cu footprinting (Supplementary Data, Fig. S1) was performed as described by Sigman et al. (40Sigman D.S. Kuwabara M.D. Chen C.B. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 414-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The chemicals used in the OP-Cu reactions (1,10-phenanthroline and 3-mercaptopropionic acid) were from Sigma. The OP-Cu reaction was quenched with 1 μl of 28 mm neocuproine (Sigma) and 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 20 μg/ml yeast tRNA, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was analyzed by 8% denaturing PAGE (Diamed SequaGel).Circular Permutation Analysis—The binding assay was performed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (32Lee L. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 2 nm 5′-32P-labeled circular permutation substrates (obtained by digestion with various restriction enzymes as described above) was incubated with 0.05 μm Cre, and the reaction was analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Determination of the bend centers and angles by circular permutation is described in detail in the Supplementary Data (Fig. S2).Phasing Analysis—The binding assay was performed by EMSA as described previously (32Lee L. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 2 nm 5′-32P-labeled phasing substrates was incubated with 0.05 μm Cre, and the reaction was analyzed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Dried gels were scanned using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and analyzed using the ImageQuaNT 5.0 software program. The marker M bands in each lane were aligned. The phasing analysis was conducted according to the method of Zinkel and Crothers (35Zinkel S.S. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) as follows. The relative electrophoretic mobility (μ) of a protein-DNA complex was calculated as the mobility of the complex divided by the mobility of the unbound substrate to correct for small variations in the mobility of the unbound substrate. The relative mobility was then normalized to the average relative mobility (μave) of the particular complex from all six phasing substrates (μ/μave). The normalized relative mobilities were plotted as a function of the linker length. The linker length is defined as the distance (bp) between the center of the kinetoplast DNA that contains the A-tracts (35Zinkel S.S. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and the middle of the lox site. The curve was plotted to the best fit polynomial curve (Microsoft Excel).RESULTSGuo and colleagues (25Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have proposed that the position and/or direction of the asymmetric DNA bend in the lox spacer region revealed in the crystal structure of the Cre-lox synaptic complex determine the site of initial strand exchange. We therefore investigated whether the scissile base pairs and Lys-86 dictate the order of strand exchange by affecting the Cre-induced DNA bending. We have probed the DNA conformation of the loxP and lox4 sites (Fig. 1) bound to Cre using chemical footprinting, circular permutation, and phase-sensitive analyses.Cre Increases the Sensitivity to DMS Methylation in the loxP and lox4 Spacer Region on the Strand Containing the Scissile G—DNA footprinting provides information about protein-DNA contacts and distortions in the DNA conformation such as bending and unwinding (40Sigman D.S.

To detect subtle changes in the DNA conformation, we probed the Cre-bound DNA using small chemical compounds. We first analyzed the sensitivity of guanine and adenine residues in the loxP and lox4 sites to methylation by dimethyl sulfate (DMS). DMS methylates the N7 group of guanine in the major groove of DNA and, to a lesser extent, the N3 group of adenine in the minor groove (41Wissmann A. Hillen W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).An 82-bp DNA substrate (S82) containing either the wild type loxP or the mutated lox4 site was treated with DMS in the absence and presence of the wild type Cre protein (Fig. 2). The DMS footprints for the top and bottom strands are shown in Fig. 2 (a and b) and summarized in Fig. 2c. The two strands of the loxP and lox4 sites differed in the sensitivity of their spacer region to DMS modification upon binding to Cre, and the differences were dependent on the location of the scissile G. The scissile G at position 4 on the bottom strand of loxP (Fig. 2b, lane 2) was protected by the wild type Cre protein, and this protection was dependent on Lys-86 (see below). Bases 3′ to the scissile G on the bottom strand of loxP (most notably position 3′A) exhibited enhanced reactivity to DMS upon binding to Cre. These enhanced sensitivities suggested that Cre causes structural alterations in the lox spacer region, possibly due to DNA bending (see “Discussion”).Cre also protected the scissile G and enhanced the DMS methylation of downstream bases (2′G, 1A, 3G, and 5T) on the top strand of lox4 (Fig. 2a, lane 6). The increased sensitivity to DMS was stronger on the top strand of lox4 than on the bottom strand of loxP. Because T residues are normally"
https://openalex.org/W2144063517,"Nucleoside diphosphates generated by glycosyltransferases in the fungal, plant, and mammalian cell secretory pathways are converted into monophosphates to relieve inhibition of the transferring enzymes and provide substrates for antiport transport systems by which the entrance of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the secretory pathway lumen is coupled to the exit of nucleoside monophosphates. Analysis of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome revealed that it encodes two enzymes with potential nucleoside diphosphatase activity, Spgda1p and Spynd1p. Characterization of the overexpressed enzymes showed that Spgda1p is a GDPase/UDPase, whereas Spynd1p is an apyrase because it hydrolyzed both nucleoside tri and diphosphates. Subcellular fractionation showed that both activities localize to the Golgi. Individual disruption of their encoding genes did not affect cell viability, but disruption of both genes was synthetically lethal. Disruption of Spgda1+ did not affect Golgi N- or O-glycosylation, whereas disruption of Spynd1+ affected Golgi N-mannosylation but not O-mannosylation. Although no nucleoside diphosphatase activity was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), N-glycosylation mediated by the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT) was not severely impaired in mutants because first, no ER accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins occurred as revealed by the absence of induction of BiP mRNA, and second, in vivo GT-dependent glucosylation monitored by incorporation of labeled Glc into folding glycoproteins showed a partial (35–50%) decrease in Spgda1 but was not affected in Spynd1 mutants. Results show that, contrary to what has been assumed to date for eukaryotic cells, in S. pombe nucleoside diphosphatase and glycosyltransferase activities can localize to different subcellular compartments. It is tentatively suggested that ER-Golgi vesicle transport might be involved in nucleoside diphosphate hydrolysis.

It is tentatively suggested that ER-Golgi vesicle transport might be involved in nucleoside diphosphate hydrolysis. Almost all nucleotide sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases in the secretory pathway generate nucleoside diphosphates that are converted into monophosphates to relieve inhibition of the transferring enzymes and provide substrates for antiport transport systems by which the entrance of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the lumen of the secretory pathway is coupled to the exit of nucleoside monophosphates (1Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijón C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Several secretory pathway nucleoside diphosphatases have been described already. There are two enzymes displaying such enzymatic activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a GDPase/UDPase and an apyrase (denominated Gda1p and Ynd1p, respectively) (2Yanagisawa K. Resnick D. Abeijón C.

Apyrases differ from nucleoside diphosphatases, as the former are able to degrade not only nucleoside diphosphates but also triphosphates. Both enzymatic activities are localized to the Golgi apparatus. Irrespective of their cellular origin, all enzymes able to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates (nucleoside diphosphatases proper and apyrases) share four highly similar sequences that have been called apyrase conserved regions. Analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome showed that Gda1p and Ynd1p were the only enzymes displaying those sequences (4Zhong X. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32704-32711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

The ER soluble enzyme is functional with Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, whereas the insoluble enzyme strictly requires the first cation for activity. The initial in vitro characterization of nucleoside monophosphates as the metabolites involved in the antiport transport of nucleotide sugars (8Hirschberg C.B. Snyder M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) received firm support when it was shown that ablation of the GDA1 or YND1 genes in S. cerevisiae affected both N- and O-protein glycosylation and glycolipid formation (3Gao X.-D.

Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the case of GDA1 disruption, it was shown that the effects observed were a consequence of a reduced entrance rate of GDP-Man into the Golgi lumen (10Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although no evidence was provided, it was assumed that mammalian cell ER nucleoside diphosphatases were required for hydrolysis of UDP generated by the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT), an enzyme involved in the quality control of glycoprotein folding (11Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In addition to this ubiquitous enzyme (S. cerevisiae is the only eukaryotic cell known so far to be devoid of GT; Refs. 12Fernandez F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 13Jakob C.A. Burda P. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the other nucleotide sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases already described in the ER lumen are the glucuronosyltransferases that also generate UDP but only occur in certain high eukaryote tissues (14Bossuyt X. Blanckaert N. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). UDP-Glc- and UDP-GlcUA-specific transporters have already been described in the rat liver cell ER (15Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6822-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bossuyt X. Blanckaert N. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the case of UDP-Glc, it was determined that the exit of UMP was coupled to entrance of the nucleotide sugar (15Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6822-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of nucleoside diphosphatase and nucleotide sugar-dependent glycosyltransferase activities in the mammalian cell ER and Golgi compartments and the exclusive presence of the former activity in the S. cerevisiae Golgi, that is, in the only secretory pathway compartment in which nucleoside diphosphates are known to occur in this yeast, supported the notion that the presence of glycosyltransferase-generated nucleoside diphosphates in a subcellular compartment necessarily implied the presence of an enzyme able to hydrolyze them in the same compartment. To further study the influence of ER nucleoside diphosphatase on GT-mediated glycoprotein folding, we chose Schizosaccharomyces pombe as model system for the ease by which this microorganism can be genetically manipulated and the well documented presence in it of an ER GT involved the quality control of glycoprotein folding (11Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). On the characterization of S. pombe nucleoside diphosphatases we made the unexpected observation that this yeast, like S. cerevisiae, only expresses two Golgi-located nucleoside diphosphatase activities, thus demonstrating that, contrary to what has been assumed so far, nucleoside diphosphatase and glycosyltransferase activities can localize to different subcellular compartments. Materials—[14C]glucose (301 Ci/mol) was from New England Nuclear. Nucleoside tri, di, and monophosphates, protease inhibitors, supplements for culture media, lysing enzyme, 1-deoxynojirimycin, mannan, and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and other enzymes used for DNA procedures were from New England Biolabs. Vector pGEMT-Easy was from Promega. The Pwo polymerase and digoxigenin (DIG DNA labeling and detection kit) were from Roche Applied Science. Zymolyase 100T was from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Strains and Culture Media—Cloning procedures were performed in Escherichia coli DH5α. The S. pombe strains were Sp61 (h–, ade1, ade6-M210, leu1–32, ura4-D18), ADp (h+, ade6-M216, leu1–32, ura4-D18), and ADm (the same as ADp but h–). The rich medium contained 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 3% glucose, and 75 mg/liter adenine. The minimal medium was as described (17Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Wabrik E. Experiments With Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 133-136Google Scholar), supplemented with adenine (75 mg/liter), uracil (75 mg/liter), and leucine (250 mg/liter). Malt extract medium was used for conjugations (18Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae strain was G2–7 (Matα, ura3–52, lys2, ade2, his3, trp1, leu2, gda1::LEU2), kindly provided by C. Abeijon (Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Boston University). S. cerevisiae cells were grown in rich medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone (Difco), and 2% glucose) or in selective medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose, supplemented with 30 mg/liter adenine, tryptophan, histidine, and lysine). N-Glycan Labeling—For assessing the Golgi extension, cells in the exponential growth phase were harvested, extensively washed with 1% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), resuspended in the same medium, and incubated (0.3 g in 1 ml) for 30 min at 28 °C in the presence of 5 mm [14C]glucose (30.1 Ci/mol). After chasing cells with 50 mm Glc (final concentration), cells were incubated for an additional 60 min. For assessing ER N-glycosylation, incubations lasted for only 15 min and were not chased. Where indicated, 5 mm 1-deoxynojirimycin or the same plus 5 mm dithiothreitol were added to incubations; the first reagent for 30 min and the second one for 5 min before the label. For further details on the labeling procedure and preparation of whole cell Endo H-sensitive N-glycans, see Ref. 12Fernandez F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol.

O-Glycan Labeling—Cells, extensively washed previously with 1% yeast nitrogen base, were resuspended in the same medium (0.16 g in 1 ml) and incubated for 60 min in the presence of 5 mm [14C]Glc (30.1 Ci/mol), chased with 50 mm Glc (final concentration), and incubated for an additional 60 min. Cells were then processed as above for obtaining N-glycans, but the denatured cell pellets obtained after organic solvent-water treatments were incubated with 0.4 ml of 0.1 n NaOH overnight at room temperature. Solutions were neutralized with 0.1 n HCl, and 0.3 ml of water was then added. The supernatants obtained on the addition of 2 ml of methanol were dried, resuspended in water, and desalted with a mixed bead (H+/acetate) resin. Methods—Chromatographies were performed on Whatman 1 papers with the following solvents: (i) solvent A, 1-propanol-nitromethane-water (5:2:4); (ii) solvent B, 1-butanol-pyridine-water (4:3:4); and (iii) solvent C, 1-butanol-pyridine-water (10:3:3). Strong acid hydrolysis was performed in 1 n HCl for 4 h at 100 °C. Northern blotting analysis of BiP mRNA was performed as described previously (19D′Alessio C. Fernandez F. Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25899-25905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of Spgda1p—The corresponding gene of Spgda1p (GenBank™ protein accession number NP_593447) (1671 bp) was synthesized using genomic DNA as template, Pwo polymerase, and primers 5′-ACTGGAAGATCTATGACTCCAACTATGAAATC-3′ and 5′-ACGATCCGCTCGAGAATTTCTTCTTTCACGTTAC-3′. The gene was then digested with BglII and XhoI and cloned into the BglII/XhoI sites of expression vector p416-GPD, which confers uracil prototrophy. The plasmid was amplified in E. coli, and colonies were analyzed with Spgda1+ internal primers 5′-AAATTTCATATGATAGAGCCTGGCTTATC-3′ (primer UDPaseM1) and 5′-CCAAACACCATCCAAGTTCC-3′ (primer 824a1). Plasmids were purified and analyzed by SpeI and XhoI digestion. Plasmids were then transfected into S. cerevisiae by electroporation (2.5 kV, 25 μF, 200 ohms). Cells were grown for 1 h in rich medium and plated in selective medium. Colonies were then analyzed by PCR using the above mentioned internal primers. Cloning and Expression of Spynd1p—The above procedure was used, but the primers for synthesizing the Spynd1p gene (GenBank™ protein accession number NP_588201) (1719 bp) were 5′-ACGCGGATCCATGGTTCGAAAGTATGG-3′ and 5′-TCCGGAATTCTTAAGGAAAAGGGGATC-3′ (primer c11E10a-EcoRI). The restriction enzymes employed were BamHI and EcoRI. Primers used for colony analysis were 5′-CTTCTGCTCTCTCTGATTTG-3′ (from the vector) and 5′-ATAATGTACGGAGCCTTGCG-3′ (c11E10a, internal Spynd1+ primer). Disruption of Spgda1+—A 1196-bp internal fragment was synthesized using genomic DNA as the template and primers 5′-TGATGATCGATGCTGGTTCC-3′ and 824a1. The fragment was cloned in the pGEMT-Easy vector and sequenced. The ura4+ gene marker (GenBank™ accession number M36504) was introduced in position 738 of the 1196-bp fragment in the vector (HindIII site). Digestion with NotI liberated a 2960-bp fragment containing the ura4+ gene flanked by 738 bp (5′) and 436 bp (3′) of Spgda1+. The fragment was transfected into S. pombe Sp61 cells, and transformants were selected in minimal medium supplemented with adenine and leucine. The mutant genotype was h–, ade1, ade6-M210, leu1–32, ura4-D18, Spgda1::ura4+. Characterization of Spgda1 Mutants—Mutant genomic DNA was digested with XmnI and SphI, run on 1.2% agarose gels, and submitted to successive Southern blotting analysis using first a 740-bp SacII/HindIII Spgda1+ fragment derived from the pGEMT-Easy vector containing the 1196-bp fragment and then the entire ura4+ gene as probes. Both probes were labeled with digoxigenin. The expected fragments of 1274- and 3038-bp for wild type and mutant cells were obtained. Disruption of Spynd1+—A 1309-bp Spynd1+ fragment was amplified using genomic DNA as template, Pwo polymerase, and primers 5′-TTGCTGCTCATGCTATTCCC-3′ (primer c11E10s) and c11E10a. The fragment was cloned in pGEMT-Easy, and a central 431-bp fragment (between positions 674 and 1105 of Spynd1+) was removed from it by HindIII treatment. The ura4+ marker gene replaced this fragment. NotI digestion liberated a 2642-bp fragment displaying ura4+ flanked by 435-bp (5′) and 423-bp (3′) Spynd1+ fragments. This fragment was used to transform Sp61 and ADp S. pombe strains. Transformants were selected in minimal medium containing adenine and leucine. The mutant genotypes were h+, ade6-M216, leu1–32, ura4-D18, Spynd1::ura4+ and h–, ade6-M210, leu1–32, ura4D-18, Spynd1::ura4+. Characterization of Spynd1 Mutants—Colony PCR reactions were performed on water-resuspended cells using a primer homologous to a portion of Spynd1+ outside the fragment used for gene disruption (primer c11E10a-EcoRI) and a primer specific for ura4+ (5′-TGCTCCTACAACATTACC-3′). Positive colonies displaying the expected 838-bp band were submitted to Southern blotting analysis. For this purpose, genomic DNA was digested with MspI and run on a 1.2% agarose gel. Probes successively used were, first, a 424-bp fragment obtained by NcoI and HindII digestion of plasmid pGEMT-Easy containing the 1309-bp fragment and then the entire ura4+ gene. The probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by the Random Primer (Promega) method. The expected and detected fragments contained 514 and 2377 bp in the wild type and the Spynd1 mutant cell genomes, respectively. Construction of alg6 Mutants—alg6 mutant construction was performed as described previously for the Sp95 strain (which is h90) but with strains ADp and Sp61 (20Fanchiotti S. Fernandez F. D′Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The construction was characterized by Southern blotting analysis as described previously (20Fanchiotti S. Fernandez F. D′Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mutant genotype was h+, ade6-M216, leu1–32, ura4-D18, alg6::ura4+. Construction of Spgda1/alg6 and Spynd1/alg6 Double Mutants— Strains h–, ade1, ade6-M210, leu1–32, ura4-D18, Spgda1::ura4+ and h+ , ade6-M216, leu1–32, ura4-D18, alg6::ura4+ or h–, ade6-M216, leu1–32, ura4-D18, Spynd1::ura4+, and h+, ade6-M216, leu1–32, ura4-D18, alg6::ura4+ were conjugated in malt extract medium, and diploids were selected in minimal medium solely supplemented with leucine. Diploids spontaneously sporulate after 7 days in this medium. Tetrads were dissected and allowed to grow in rich medium with adenine. Germinated spores were then grown in minimal medium supplemented with adenine and leucine in the presence or absence of uracil to characterize tetrads. The genotypes of spores germinated from each tetratype tetrad were analyzed by colony PCR with primers specific for each disrupted gene and a combination of three primers to determine the mating type. For alg6+, the primers used were 5′-CCAGAGCTAAAAGACGTTTAC-3′ and 5′-CGAATGGTTTGCTGATGT-3′, which amplify 800- and 2564-bp bands for the wild type gene and the alg6::ura+ insertion, respectively. For the gene Spgda1+, the primers used were UDPaseM1 and 824a1, which yield 1104- and 2868-bp bands for the wild type gene and the Spgda1::ura4+ insertion, respectively. For the gene Spynd1, the primers used were c11E10s and c11E10a-EcoRI, which yield 1492- and 2825-bp fragments for the wild type and the Spynd1::ura4+ insertion, respectively. For mating type determination, the primers MT1 (5′-AGAAGAGAGAGTAGTTGAAG-3′), MP (5′-ACGGTAGTCATCGGTCTTCC-3′), and MM (5′-TACGTTCAGTAGACGTAGTG-3′) were used. They amplify the 729-bp bands in h– (MT1/MM) and the 987-bp bands in h+ strains (MT1/MP), respectively. Germinated spores were grown in rich medium without adenine for determination of the adenine genotype. Failed Attempts of Spgda1/Spynd1 Double Mutant Construction— Strains h–, ade1, ade6-M210, leu1–32, ura4-D18, Spgda1::ura4+, and h+ , ade6-M216, leu1–32, ura4-D18, Spynd1::ura4+ were conjugated and sporulated. The colonies yielded by 24 tetrads were analyzed by colony PCR using above indicated primers that yield differential length fragments for Spgda1+, Spgda1::ura4+, Spynd1+, and Spynd1::ura4+ as well as by the ability of individual spores to grow in the absence of uracil (the original strains were ura4–, and the ura4+ gene was used to disrupt both Spgda1+ and Spynd1+). Enzymatic Assays—S. pombe and S. cerevisiae microsomes were prepared as described previously (12Fernandez F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleoside phosphatase activities were essentially assayed as described with slight modifications (21Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, between 10 and 50 μg of membrane proteins were incubated in a total volume of 100 μl in 0.2 m imidazole buffer, pH 7.2, 0.1% digitonin, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm the corresponding nucleoside phosphate, and incubated for 5–10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped on the addition of 100 μl of 10% SDS and 100 μl of water. Liberated phosphate was assayed as described (22Ames B. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-117Crossref Scopus (3013) Google Scholar), employing 15-min incubations at 45 °C. Phosphates present either in microsomes and reagents or liberated during incubations at 45 °C were estimated for each tube with blanks in which the SDS was added before the membrane fractions. Glucosidase II was assayed using [glucose-14C]Glc1Man9GlcNAc1 (23Bosch M. Trombetta S. Engstrom U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or p-nitrophenyglucoside (24Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as substrates, depending on whether microsomes or sucrose gradient fractions were the enzyme source. Galactosyltransferase was assayed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 1.2 mm MnCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, UDP-[14C]Gal (300 Ci/mol), 2 mg of S. cerevisiae mannan, and 10 μl of gradient fraction. After 60 min at 30 °C, a label soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid but insoluble in 66% methanol containing 0.1 m LiCl was quantified. Values obtained on incubations in which mannan was added after stopping the reactions were subtracted. GT was assayed with denatured thyroglobulin as the acceptor substrate as described previously (25Trombetta S.E. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (26Antebi A. Fink G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 27Simeon A. Egner R. Gascon S. Suarez-Rendueles P. Yeast. 1995; 11: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Mutant cells (∼4 g) grown in rich medium to an OD620 nm of 2 were harvested, washed with 10 mm sodium azide, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1.4 m sorbitol, 10 mm sodium azide, and 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Lysing enzyme and zymolyase 100T were then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml each. Conversion into spheroplasts was performed at 37 °C and was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm after a one-hundredth dilution in water. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm EDTA after ∼75% of cells had been converted into spheroplasts. The latter were purified by a 12-min centrifugation through a 1.8 m sorbitol cushion. The spheroplasts were resuspended in a hypoosmotic buffer (15 mm triethanolamine-acetate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.3 m sorbitol, and 1 mm EDTA containing 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 μm E-64, and 0.5 mm tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone), lysed by several passages through a serological pipette, and homogenized with 15 strokes in a Wheaton B (Wheaton Scientific) homogenizer. Non-lysed cells were removed by centrifugation (450 × g for 3 min). Each of two 1.5-ml aliquots of the post-nuclear supernatant (S450) was poured onto a gradient having 1 ml of 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 40, 42, 46, and 50% sucrose concentrations (for the Spgda1 mutant the 42% sucrose fraction was omitted) in 15 mm triethanolamine-acetate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 3 mm MgCl2. Tubes were centrifuged for 2.5 h at 185,000 × g in a swinging bucket rotor. Fractions were collected from the top (the first fraction had 1.5 ml, and successive ones had 1 ml). Materials in the first fractions and pellets were discarded. Sucrose concentrations were determined with a refractometer, and fractions having similar concentrations in both gradients were pooled, 5-fold diluted with 20 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA, and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of the last buffer containing the above indicated protease inhibitor concentrations. Supernatants (S450) were also centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g and resuspended as the gradient fraction pellets to determine total enzymatic activities. The latter as well as the protein concentrations were determined in all fractions. Analysis of S. pombe Genome—BLAST analysis of proteins encoded in the recently completed S. pombe genome, using as probes sequences of S. cerevisiae Gda1p or Ynd1p, mammalian soluble ER GDPase/UDPase, mammalian membrane-bound ER Ca2+-dependent GDPase/UDPase, human Golgi apyrase (respective GenBank™ accession numbers NP_010872, AAF17573, CAB45533, CAC85467 and AAC17217), or the protein portions encompassing the four so-called apyrase conserved regions in the three first enzymes, showed that the fission yeast genome codes for the two proteins with putative nucleoside diphosphatase activity (GenBank™ accession numbers NP_593447 and NP_588201) were the same as that of S. cerevisiae. The first sequence corresponds to a 556-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 61.6 kDa. The protein displays a signal peptide, one potential N-glycosylation consensus sequence, the four canonical apyrase conserved regions and, as with S. cerevisiae Gda1p, no other potential transmembrane region besides the signal peptide. The second sequence corresponds to a 572-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 64.6 kDa. This protein does not display a signal peptide but does have a potential transmembrane region close to the C terminus, thus suggesting a type I membrane protein. These same features are shared by S. cerevisiae Ynd1p. The second putative S. pombe nucleoside diphosphatase displays the four apyrase conserved regions and three potential N-glycosylation consensus sequences. Proteins coded by sequences of NP_593447 and NP_588201 will be referred to as Spgda1p and Spynd1p, respectively, because of their respective similarity to the S. cerevisiae enzymes. Percent similarities of the above mentioned proteins are shown in Table I.Table IPercent similarity of nucleoside diphosphatase sequencesSpgda1p (GDPase/UDPase)Spynd1p (apyrase)S. pombe Spynd1p (apyrase)25S. cerevisiae Gda1p (GDPase/UDPase)49.418.1S. cerevisiae Ynd1p (apyrase)2440.7Mammalian ER GDPase/UDPase (soluble)41.326.4Mammalian ER GDPase/UDPase (membrane bound)31.022.8Mammalian Golgi apyrase24.223.1 Open table in a new tab Characterization of Putative S. pombe Nucleoside Diphosphatase Activities—Genes coding for Spgda1p and Spynd1p were transfected and overexpressed in S. cerevisiae Δgda1 mutants. Figs. 1, A and B and 2, A and B show the nucleoside diphosphate specificity and cation requirements of Spgda1p and Spynd1p. The first enzyme is essentially a GDPase/UDPase, whereas the second one is an apyrase as it hydrolyzes not only nucleoside diphosphates but also triphosphates. In addition, no marked specificity toward the base was observed in Spynd1p. Both enzymes required a bivalent cation for activity (Ca2+, Mg 2+, or Mn2+). Results show that Spgda1p and Spynd1p closely resemble S. cerevisiae Gda1p and Ynd1p, respectively.Fig. 2Cation dependence of expressed Spgda1p and Spynd1p.

https://openalex.org/W2068350287,"Herpes virus thymidine kinases are responsible for the activation of nucleoside antiviral drugs including (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine. Such viral thymidine kinases (tk), beside having a broader substrate specificity compared with host cell enzymes, also show significant variation in nucleoside phosphorylation among themselves. We have determined the crystal structure of Varicella zoster virus (VZV, human herpes virus 3) thymidine kinase complexed with (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate and ADP. Differences in the conformation of a loop region (residues 55–61) and the position of two α-helices at the subunit interface of VZV-tk compared with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (human herpes virus 1) enzyme give rise to changes in the positioning of residues such as tyrosine 66 and glutamine 90, which hydrogen bond to the substrate in the active site. Such changes in combination with the substitution in VZV-tk of two phenylalanine residues (in place of a tyrosine and methionine), which sandwich the substrate pyrimidine ring, cause an alteration in the positioning of the base. The interaction of the (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine deoxyribose ring with the protein is altered by substitution of tyrosine 21 and phenylalanine 139 (analagous to herpes simplex virus type 1 histidine 58 and tyrosine 172), which may explain some of the differences in nucleoside sugar selectivity between both enzymes. The altered active site architecture may also account for the differences in the substrate activity of ganciclovir for the two thymidine kinases. These data should be of use in the design of novel antiherpes and antitumor drugs.

Whereas Varicella is generally considered to be a mild childhood disease, in adults it may be complicated by pneumonia and encephalitis and in immunocompromised patients it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality (1Snoeck R. Gerard M. Sadzot-Delvaux C. Andrei G. Balzarini J. Reymen D. Ahadi N. De Bruyn J.M. Piette J. Rentier B. Clumeck N. De Clerq E. J. Med. Virol. 1994; 42: 338-347Google Scholar).The mammalian thymidine kinase is part of the pyrimidine salvage pathway and catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group from ATP to thymidine to give thymidine monophosphate. Both HSV1-tk (human herpes virus 1-tk) and VZV-tk have an additional thymidylate kinase activity that converts thymidine monophosphate to thymidine diphosphate. The substrate specificity of VZV-tk is also broader than the host cell kinase with a wide range of nucleoside analogues able to be phosphorylated (2Fyfe J.A. Keller P.M. Furman P.A. Miller R.L. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8721-8727Google Scholar, 3Fyfe J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 432-437Google Scholar, 4Naesens L. De Clercq E. Herpes. 2001; 8: 12-16Google Scholar). Many of the drugs utilized to treat herpes virus infections are nucleoside analogues such as the pyrimidine nucleoside BVDU or the guanine nucleoside analogues, aciclovir and ganciclovir (Scheme 1), which are activated by the viral thymidine kinase (4Naesens L. De Clercq E. Herpes. 2001; 8: 12-16Google Scholar).Thus, the broad substrate specificity of herpes virus thymidine kinases is of interest pharmaceutically, both for the action of antiviral drugs and increasingly for their potential use in enzyme pro-drug gene therapy of tumors (5Grignet-Debrus C. Calberg-Bacq C.M. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 560-569Google Scholar, 6Degrève B. Andrei G. Izquierdo M. Piette J. Morin K. Knaus E.E. Wiebe L.I. Basrah I. Walker R.T. De Clercq E. Balzarini J.

In both cases, cells expressing the viral thymidine kinase either monophosphorylate or diphosphorylate nucleoside analogues. Further metabolism by cellular enzymes results in the formation of nucleotide triphosphates that either inhibit cellular DNA polymerases by substrate competition (e.g. idoxuridine) or by DNA chain termination (e.g. ACV), thereby causing cell death (4Naesens L. De Clercq E. Herpes. 2001; 8: 12-16Google Scholar).The HSV1 and HSV2 thymidine kinases (human herpes virus 1 and 2, respectively) have 79% amino acid sequence identity, whereas VZV-tk is more divergent, sharing only 29% overall sequence identity with either of the herpes simplex virus enzymes (8Suzutani T. Davies L.C. Honess R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1011-1016Google Scholar). When considering the nucleoside selectivity of VZV both for a series of related compounds against VZV-tk and a comparison with the specificity of HSV1-tk, a number of differences have been determined (3Fyfe J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 432-437Google Scholar, 9Chen M.S. Prusoff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1325-1327Google Scholar, 10Yokota T. Konno K. Mori S. Shigeta S. Kumagai M. Watanabe Y. Machida H.

Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 230-233Google Scholar). However, care must be taken in interpreting nucleoside specificity results because data for many compounds have only been derived from antiviral assays in tissue culture, which thus means that in any comparison a series of steps are being assessed. Thus, in addition to the DNA polymerase, a series of nucleoside activation steps (including the thymidine kinase) are being assayed. Studies have shown while enzyme and antiviral assays may correlate for some 5-substituted uracil nucleoside analogues as well as the purine analogues ACV and GCV, it is not the case for all of the nucleosides (14Bevilacqua F. Davis-Poynter N. Worrallo J. Gower D. Collins P. Darby G. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1927-1935Google Scholar, 15Ashida N. Watanabe Y. Miura S. Kano F. Sakata S. Yamaguchi T. Suzutani T. Machida H. Antiviral. Res. 1997; 35: 167-175Google Scholar). For example, the EC50 for ethyl-DU, vinyl-DU, ethynyl-DU, propynyl-DU, and bromovinyl-DU against VZV-infected cells were found to be >12,000-fold different. However, the Ki values determined for the nucleosides against VZV-tk in the same study show only a 20-fold difference, indicating that a relatively minor component of this selectivity is attributable to the tk activation step. ACV has been the main drug of choice against VZV and HSV infections (16Cohen J.I. Brunell P.A. Straus S.E. Krause P.R. Ann. Intern. Med. 1999; 130: 922-932Google Scholar), although its antiviral activity is much greater against HSV (types 1 and 2) than it is against VZV (4Naesens L. De Clercq E. Herpes. 2001; 8: 12-16Google Scholar, 17Andrei G. Snoeck R. Neyts J. Sandvold M.L. Myhren F. De Clercq E. Antiviral Res. 2000; 45: 157-167Google Scholar), a result of the differing affinities for the thymidine kinases where the Ki for ACV against VZV-tk is 830 μm (18Roberts G.B. Fyfe J.A. Gaillard R.K. Short S.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6407-6413Google Scholar) compared with 200 μm for HSV1-tk (19Kussmann-Gerber S. Kuonen O. Folkers G. Pilger B.D. Scapozza L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 472-481Google Scholar, 20Pilger B.D. Perozzo R. Alber F. Wurth C. Folkers G. Scapozza L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31967-31973Google Scholar). Even more marked is the difference in potency for GCV, which binds with a similar affinity to VZV-tk as ACV but more tightly to HSV1-tk with a Ki of 48 μm (7De Clercq E. Naesens L. De Bolle L. Schols D. Zhang Y. Neyts J. Rev. Med. Virol. 2001; 11: 381-395Google Scholar, 21Vogt J. Perozzo R. Pautsch A. Prota A. Schelling P. Pilger B. Folkers G. Scapozza L. Schulz G.E. Proteins. 2000; 41: 545-553Google Scholar).BVDU (brivudin) has been licensed for the treatment of VZV in Germany and is undergoing licensing approval in a number of other European countries (4Naesens L. De Clercq E. Herpes. 2001; 8: 12-16Google Scholar). The efficacy of BVDU is similar for both HSV1 and VZV. Both tks have Ki values of 0.1 μm and similar kcat/Km values (15Ashida N. Watanabe Y. Miura S. Kano F. Sakata S. Yamaguchi T. Suzutani T. Machida H. Antiviral. Res. 1997; 35: 167-175Google Scholar, 19Kussmann-Gerber S. Kuonen O. Folkers G. Pilger B.D. Scapozza L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 472-481Google Scholar, 22Sienaert R. Naesens L. Brancale A. De Clercq E. McGuigan C. Balzarini J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 249-254Google Scholar). The most potent compounds against VZV are found within the BVDU-related halogen-vinyl araU series. For example, the EC50 for BVaraU (sorivudine) against VZV is 0.0023 μm with chlorovinyl- and iodovinyl-araU having similar values (15Ashida N. Watanabe Y. Miura S. Kano F. Sakata S. Yamaguchi T. Suzutani T. Machida H. Antiviral. Res. 1997; 35: 167-175Google Scholar). BVDU is 19-fold less potent against the virus than BVaraU; however, the Ki values against VZV-tk are 0.25 and 0.1 μm, respectively, suggesting that most of the difference in selectivity for VZV-infected cells is not the result of the thymidine kinase (15Ashida N. Watanabe Y. Miura S. Kano F. Sakata S. Yamaguchi T. Suzutani T. Machida H. Antiviral. Res. 1997; 35: 167-175Google Scholar). The EC50 for BVaraU against HSV1 is 0.06 μm compared with 0.0023 μm for VZV (15Ashida N. Watanabe Y. Miura S. Kano F. Sakata S. Yamaguchi T. Suzutani T. Machida H. Antiviral. Res. 1997; 35: 167-175Google Scholar). A chimeric HSV1 constructed to express the VZV-tk instead of HSV1-tk had the same sensitivity to BVaraU as VZV, suggesting that in this case the increased potency of this compound is attributable to the thymidine kinase (14Bevilacqua F. Davis-Poynter N. Worrallo J. Gower D. Collins P. Darby G. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1927-1935Google Scholar). VZV-tk shows some selectivity for the sugar moiety of nucleoside analogues. The Ki values for 2-deoxyribose, arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, and ribose derivatives of BV-uracil nucleosides are 0.12, 0.25, 2.75, and 4.48 μm, respectively (15Ashida N. Watanabe Y. Miura S. Kano F. Sakata S. Yamaguchi T. Suzutani T. Machida H. Antiviral. Res. 1997; 35: 167-175Google Scholar).Although there have been several reports of the crystal structure determination of HSV1-tk complexes (23Brown D.G. Visse R. Sandhu G. Davies A. Rizkallah P.J.

Sanderson M.R. Proteins. 1998; 32: 350-361Google Scholar), there have been no other herpes thymidine kinase structures published as yet. To investigate the basis of differences in substrate specificity of herpes virus thymidine kinases, we have solved the crystal structure of VZV-tk complexed with BVDU-MP and ADP. This structure will both aid the rational design of novel ligands for use as drugs to treat viral infections as well as for combined gene therapy/chemotherapy approaches to provide a novel means of treating cancer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification—A pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) derived construct with the entire VZV-tk coding sequence contained in a EcoRI/SalI fragment was used as the source of the VZV-tk gene. 2J.

The gene was transferred as a EcoRI/SalI fragment into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to make the expression vector pGEX6P1VZV-TK, which has a rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site (utilized to remove the GST). The expression plasmid was transformed into BL21 for protein expression. 5 μl of the transformation mixture was used to inoculate 120 ml of LB + 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, and the culture was grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C. The culture was then diluted 1/50 into 6 liters and grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm, and induction was carried out at 18 °C for 18 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was frozen at –80 °C until required. After defrosting, the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Lysozyme was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 40 μg/ml, and it was stirred for 20 min at room temperature prior to being sonicated on ice and then stirred further at room temperature for 30 min. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and applied at 0.25 ml/min to a 5-ml glutathione-Sepharose column (GST-Trap, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A until the base line returned to zero followed by buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) until the base line restabilized. 0.5 mg of GST-3C protease was added to the column in 5 ml of buffer B, and the column was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The VZV-tk was eluted at 0.2 ml/min by washing the GST column with buffer B, the outlet flow was directed through a 1-ml GST-Trap column connected in series (this is to help bind any free GST, GST-3C, and GST-VZV-tk). The pool from the GST-Trap column was concentrated by centrifugation in Vivaspin 6 concentrators (Vivascience) and applied to a Superdex 200 HR gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with buffer C (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl). The fractions containing the VZV-tk were pooled, diluted 4-fold with water to give a buffer concentration of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl, concentrated to 8 mg/ml by centrifugation in Vivaspin 2 concentrators, and stored frozen at –80 °C.Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—Screening for crystallization conditions was carried out using a variety of commercially available screening kits (Hampton Research) together with a range of ligand sets. Thin plate-like crystals were obtained using a sitting drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution at 21 °C. Despite screening a large range of ligand combinations, crystals were only obtained from 8 mg/ml VZV-tk with the addition of 0.4 mm ATP, 0.2 mm BVDU, and 0.6 mm MgCl2 (these conditions were intended to give the products of the thymidylate kinase reaction) and reservoirs containing 100 mm sodium acetate at either pH 4.5 or 5.0 and between 6 and 11% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000.The x-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline ID14-EH2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). A very thin plate crystal (∼10-μm thick) was first soaked in reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol for a few seconds and then flash-frozen and maintained at 100 K during data collection. A total of 360 data frames of 1° oscillation were recorded using an ADSC-Q4 CCD area detector with an exposure time of 12 s/frame and a crystal to detector distance of 250 mm. The data frames were indexed and integrated with DENZO and were merged with SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the P21 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 99.7 Å, b = 54.2 Å, c = 167.8 Å, and β = 94.8°. There are four subunits in the asymmetric unit and a crystal solvent content of 58%. The final data set is 99.9% complete to a 3.2-Å resolution with a merging R-factor of 0.171 and a redundancy of >5-fold (Table I).Table IStatistics for crystallographic structure determinationData collection detailsData collection siteESRF 1D14-EH2DetectorCCD ADSC-Q4Wavelength (Å)0.933Space groupP21Unit cell dimensions (a, b, c in Å)99.7, 54.2, 167.8, β = 94.8°Resolution range (Å)30.0-3.20Observations167134Unique reflections30040Completeness (%)99.9Average I/σ(I)4.5Rmerge0.171Outer resolution shellResolution range (Å)3.31-3.20Unique reflections2925Completeness (%)99.6Average I/σ(I)1.1Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)30.0-3.20No. of reflections (working/test)28537/1490R-factor (Rwork/Rfree)0.236/0.267No. atoms (protein/substrate-inhibitor)9914/200R.m.s. bond-length deviation (Å)0.0086R.m.s. bond-angle deviation (°)1.32Mean B-factor (Å2)36/40/77R.m.s. backbone B-factor deviation (Å2)4.5 Open table in a new tab The structure of VZV-tk was determined by molecular replacement. The self-rotation function revealed two 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetries (NCS), one parallel to the crystal 2-fold screw axis and another on the XZ plane.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) using the HSV1-tk dimer (Protein Data Bank accession number 1E2K (see Ref. 29Prota A. Vogt J. Pilger B. Perozzo R. Wurth C. Marquez V.E. Russ P. Schulz G.E. Folkers G. Scapozza L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9597-9603Google Scholar)) as the search model resulted in the correct orientations and positions of the two VZV-tk dimers in the crystal asymmetric unit. The two monomers of each dimer are related by a 2-fold NCS, and the two dimers are related by a rotation of 165°.Given the relatively low sequence identity (29%) between VZV and HSV-1 tks, unsurprisingly, the initial R-factor (50.2%) for data between 10.0- and 4.0-Å resolution was high. Although the x-ray data are relatively weak and only to a moderate resolution, the refinement of VZV-tk structure greatly benefited from the use of 4-fold NCS restraints. The model rebuilding has been made possible by 4-fold NCS real space electron density averaging using the program GAP. 3D. I. Stuart, J. M. Grimes, and J. M. Diprose, unpublished program. Modeling of Ganciclovir Binding to VZV-tk—The docking of GCV was carried out using G.O.L.D., version 1.2, with the genetic algorithm set at “default parameter settings.” An appropriate center point for each docking run was chosen with a calculation radius of 20 Å on chain A of VZV-tk. Additional fitness flags included the flipping of free corners, planar nitrogens, and amide bonds, and a total of 20 dockings were set up for each ligand run with a r.m.s. tolerance of 1.5 Å for early termination. Once docking was complete, the top three solutions were subjected to conjugate gradient minimization using the program NAMD2 and the CHARMM22 force-field. For this, an 8-Å radius was defined from the center point of each docked ligand where full flexibility was imparted to the surrounding protein structure. Atoms beyond this radius were fixed during the calculation to maintain the overall integrity of the crystal structure.RESULTSOverall Structure—The final refined structure (Protein Data Bank accession number 1OSN) has an Rworking of 0.236 and an Rfree of 0.267 for all of the data to 3.2-Å resolution with retention of excellent stereochemistry. The r.m.s. deviations from ideality for the model are 0.0086 Å for bond lengths and 1.3° for bond angles (Table I). Because of the tight NCS restraints in the refinement, the r.m.s. deviation for Cα atoms between any two monomers is <0.1 Å. The current VZV-tk model has electron density present for residues: 8–185 and 192–338 in the A chain (for residues 185 and 192–194, density is only visible for the main chain) and 8–112, 124–185, and 195–338 in the B, C, and D chains, respectively. In addition, there are four BVDU-MP and four ADP ligands. The quality of the electron density is exemplified by the maps shown in Fig. 1, a and b. The original GenBank™ entry for VZV-tk available at the time that we started the structure determination had residue 143 annotated as a glycine, whereas in common with HSV1 and HSV2-tk sequences (Fig. 2), the electron density clearly shows an arginine (Fig. 1a). Sequencing of the plasmid and subsequent updates of GenBank™ have confirmed this assignment. The two dimers in the asymmetric unit of the crystal are cross-linked by a disulfide bridge between the Cys-63 residues on the A and D subunits (Fig. 1c). However, given its intracellular location and the lack of evidence that VZV-tk or indeed any other herpes virus thymidine kinases function as tetramers, it is likely that this cross-linking it not biologically relevant and occurred during the crystallization process.Fig. 1Overall structure of VZV-tk.a, a representative 2Fo – Fc electron density map contoured at 1σ showing residues 139–148 of the A subunit. b, simulated-annealing omit electron density map contoured at 3σ showing the bound BVDU-MP and ADP in the A subunit. c, the two dimers in the crystal asymmetric unit.

Davies L.C. Honess R.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1011-1016Google Scholar), 258 of 325 Cα atoms from VZV-tk superimpose onto HSV1-tk (Protein Data Bank accession number 1E2K) with an overall r.m.s. deviation of 1.3 Å. Thus, there is a general structural similarity with both HSV1-tk and the related adenylate kinase structure (23Brown D.G. Visse R. Sandhu G. Davies A. Rizkallah P.J. Melitz C. Summers W.C. Sanderson M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 876-881Google Scholar, 24Wild K. Bohner T. Aubry A. Folkers G. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 289-292Google Scholar, 30Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H.

The loop between residues 110 and 122 in VZV-tk is longer than the equivalent loop in HSV1-tk (residues 145–154) because of an insertion of two residues (Figs. 1d and 2), and in contrast to HSV1-tk structures, residues 231–249 are ordered with amino acids 232–241, forming a short α-helix. The two monomers in the VZV-tk dimer are related by 2-fold symmetry; however, the orientation of the symmetry axis is different from HSV1-tk such that if the A chains of HSV1-tk and VZV-tk are overlapped, there is a 9° offset between the B chains. The dimerization interface in HSV1-tk chiefly consists of residues from five helices (Fig. 2, α2, α4, α5, η2/α8, and α13 in VZV-tk), the C terminus, and a loop (23Brown D.G. Visse R. Sandhu G. Davies A. Rizkallah P.J. Melitz C. Summers W.C. Sanderson M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 876-881Google Scholar, 24Wild K. Bohner T. Aubry A. Folkers G. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 289-292Google Scholar). The majority of the interface in VZV-tk comprises the same secondary structural elements as HSV1-tk; however, the nature of the side chains involved is quite different. An alignment of the HSV1-tk structure to the core secondary structure elements containing the active site (Protein Data Bank accession number 1KI8 (see Ref. 26Champness J.N. Bennett M.S. Wien F. Visse R. Summers W.C. Herdewijn P. de Clerq E. Ostrowski T. Jarvest R.L. Sanderson M.R. Proteins. 1998; 32: 350-361Google Scholar)) shows that although the Cα backbone of most of the molecule aligns well, residues 55–95 do not (Figs. 1d and 3a). This is the result of two major structural differences in the subunit interface and active site structural elements, namely in residues 51–54 (helix α2), the loop between amino acids 55 and 61 (HSV1-tk-(90–96)) and in the helices and loops comprising residues 62–106 (Fig. 3a, α3, α4, and α5 in HSV1-tk-(112–141)). In the subunit interface, to accommodate Trp-277 (HSV1-tk Phe-308) on the one subunit, there is a conformational change within the loop (residues 55–61) relative to HSV1-tk. The loop conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between Glu-59 with His-8 (both from the A chain) and Arg-84 from the B chain. The loop movement relative to HSV1-tk results in the conserved amino acids Tyr-52 (in the preceding α2 helix; HSV1-tk-87) and Leu-56 (in the loop; HSV1-tk-91) having completely different conformations and interactions across the subunit interface (Fig. 3a). Following the loop, amino acids in the α3 and α4 helices that contain both active site residues such as Tyr-66 and Gln-95 and make subunit interface contacts have differences between 1.0 and 4.4 Å in Cα positions for the two tks.Fig. 3The active site structure of VZV-tk.a, stereodiagram showing the difference at the dimer interface between VZV-tk and HSV1-tk and its effect on the active site structure.

https://openalex.org/W2047081835,"Autophosphorylation in the activation loop is a common mechanism regulating the activities of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs). PTKs in the Csk family, Csk and Chk, are rare exceptions for lacking Tyr residues in this loop. We probed the function of this loop in Csk by extensive site-specific mutagenesis and kinetic studies using physiological and artificial substrates. These studies led to several surprising conclusions. First, specific residues in Csk activation loop had little discernable functions in phosphorylation of its physiological substrate Src, as Ala scanning and loop replacement mutations decreased Csk activity toward Src less than 40%. Second, some activation loop mutants, such as a single residue deletion or replacing all residues with Gly, exhibited 1–2% of wild type (wt) activity toward artificial substrates, but significantly higher activity toward Src. Third, introduction of a thrombin cleavage site to the activation loop also resulted in loss of 98% of wt activity for poly(E4Y) and loss of 95% of wt activity toward Src, but digestion with thrombin to cut the activation loop, resulted in full recovery of wt activity toward both substrates. This suggested that the catalytic machinery is fully functional without the activation loop, implying an inhibitory role by the activation loop as a regulatory structure. Fourth, Arg313, although universally conserved in protein kinases, and essential for the activity of other PTKs so far tested, is not important for Csk activity. These findings provide new perspectives for understanding autophosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism and imply key differences in Csk recognition of artificial and physiological substrates.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays crucial roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, the cell cycle, and transmission of various signals from the extracellular environment to a cell (1Hunter T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 583-605Google Scholar). This post-translational modification is catalyzed by protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; Chk, Csk-homologous kinase; CSAL, Csk with a Src activation loop; Csk, COOH-terminal Src kinase; Δ339, Csk mutant in which residue 339 is deleted; GAL, Csk with all activation loop residues replaced by Gly; GCSP, GST fused to Csk substrate peptide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kdSrc, kinase-defective Src; RCM-L, carboxymethylated-maleylated, reduced lysozyme; TC-Csk, thrombin-cleavable Csk; wt, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; Chk, Csk-homologous kinase; CSAL, Csk with a Src activation loop; Csk, COOH-terminal Src kinase; Δ339, Csk mutant in which residue 339 is deleted; GAL, Csk with all activation loop residues replaced by Gly; GCSP, GST fused to Csk substrate peptide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kdSrc, kinase-defective Src; RCM-L, carboxymethylated-maleylated, reduced lysozyme; TC-Csk, thrombin-cleavable Csk; wt, wild type. a large class of enzymes that transfer the γ-phosphate of ATP to specific tyrosine residues in their protein substrates. Due to their critical roles in cellular regulation, the activities of PTKs in the cells are tightly controlled. Autophosphorylation is a key mechanism regulating the activity of most PTKs (2Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 51-70Google Scholar, 3Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Google Scholar). It occurs on one or multiple Tyr residues on a loop located in the kinase domain, called the autophosphorylation loop. Since autophosphorylation activates the kinases, this loop is also called the activation loop. The catalytic domain of a PTK consists of an ATP-binding lobe, a peptide binding lobe, and a cleft between the two lobes (4Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Google Scholar). The cleft is the active site and contains two loops: the activation loop and the catalytic loop. The activation loop controls kinase activities by assuming different phosphorylation dependent conformations (3Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Google Scholar, 5Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Google Scholar). In the unphosphorylated form, the activation loop blocks the access to the active site by interactions with residues from the catalytic loop and other substructures within the ATP- and peptide-binding lobes. In this conformation the autophosphorylatable Tyr forms a hydrogen bond with a catalytically essential Asp residue located in the catalytic loop (4Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Google Scholar, 6Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Google Scholar, 7Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation results in large conformational changes in the activation loop that moves away from the active site, making the active site accessible (8Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Google Scholar, 9Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Google Scholar). The active conformation is stabilized by interactions of the phospho-Tyr in the activation loop with two Arg residues, one from the catalytic loop and the other from the activation loop (8Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Google Scholar, 9Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Google Scholar). In light of the virtual ubiquity of autophosphorylation as a key regulatory mechanism, it is intriguing that PTKs in the Csk family, COOH-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and Csk homologous kinase (Chk), do not contain a Tyr residue in the activation loop (10Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 11Grgurevich S. Linnekin D. Musso T. Zhang X. Modi W. Varesio L. Ruscetti F.W. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 103-115Google Scholar). Csk and Chk are soluble PTKs that phosphorylate PTKs of the Src family on a COOH-terminal Tyr and negatively regulate their activities (12Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Google Scholar). The kinase domains of Csk (Refs. 13Lamers M.B. Antson A.A. Hubbard R.E. Scott R.K. Williams D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 713-725Google Scholar and 14Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S. Nakagawa A. Nada S. Okada M. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14351-14354Google Scholar and Fig. 1A) and Chk share many structural features with other PTKs, such as the ATP-binding and peptide-binding lobes, and the active site cleft. Within the active site, Csk also contains the catalytic loop and the activation loop. Their catalytic loops share the consensus sequence of HRDLAARN with other PTKs. Like other PTKs, the Csk and Chk activation loops follows a Asp332-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif on the amino end and connect to p + 1 loop on the carboxyl end. But the Csk and Chk activation loops share little homology with other PTKs or with each other. Since Csk and Chk do not contain a Tyr residue in the activation loop, they appear not regulated by autophosphorylation (15Sun G. Ke S. Budde R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 194-200Google Scholar, 16Joukov V. Vihinen M. Vainikka S. Sowadski J.M. Alitalo K. Bergman M. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 927-935Google Scholar). It is not clear if this loop is involved in some alternative regulatory mechanisms. In this communication, we probed the role of the activation loop of Csk by site-specific mutagenesis and kinetic characterization. Several observations on this exceptional activation loop provide novel insights into the role of activation loops, substrate recognition, and cooperation between the regulatory and catalytic machinery of the PTK structure. Generation of Csk Mutants—(His)6-tagged Csk was expressed using pET-Csk-H6 (constructed by inserting human Csk coding sequence with a (His)6 tag sequence at the 3′-end into the pET-23 a(+)) in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli. The full-length Csk was extended by 6 His residues at the COOH terminus to aid purification. Ala scanning mutants and other Csk point mutants were generated using QuikChange (Strategene) in the parental plasmid of pET-Csk-H6. Loop replacement mutation (CSAL) was incorporated by polymerase chain reaction with primer extensions. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Enzyme Purification—The wt and mutant Csk enzymes were purified to apparent or near homogeneity by Ni2+-affinity chromatography as follows. Harvested cell paste was resuspended (culture volume versus resuspension volume = 50:1) in the binding buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl and 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and sonicated three times for 10 s each. The cell lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 34,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid-agarose column (Sigma) equilibrated with the binding buffer. After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 15 bed volumes of the wash buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl and 60 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The protein still bound to the column was eluted with elution buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl and 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The purified enzymes were desalted on a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with the storage buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). Glycerol was added to the purified fractions to 30%, and the enzymes were stored at –20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Kinase Activity Assay—For assaying PTK activities, we measured the phosphorylation of polyE4Y and kdSrc using acid precipitation assay as described previously (17Sun G. Budde R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2139-2146Google Scholar, 18Lee S. Lin X. McMurray J. Sun G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12107-12114Google Scholar). The kinase-defective Src (kdSrc) was avian Src that contained a Lys295Met mutation, which abolished its kinase activity (18Lee S. Lin X. McMurray J. Sun G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12107-12114Google Scholar, 19Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Google Scholar). When the Km and kcat were determined with regard to one substrate, kinase activity was determined at various concentrations of that substrate in the range of 20–200 μm for ATP, 20–200 μg ml–1 for poly(E4Y), and 1–10 μm for kdSrc. The kcat and Km values were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots with linear regression using the Microsoft Excel program. Carboxymethylated-maleylated, reduced lysozyme (RCM-L) and GST fused to the Csk substrate peptide (GCSP) were also used as substrates in certain assays. GCSP was generated by fusing the optimal Csk peptide sequence, EEIYFFF (20Sondhi D. Xu W. Songyang Z. Eck M.J. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 165-172Google Scholar), to the carboxyl terminus of GST. Thrombin Digestion—Equal amounts (20 μg) of wt Csk, or the Csk mutant TC-Csk, were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.8 μg of thrombin (∼2 NIH units) in the thrombin digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) at 25 °C for 2 h. At the end of the digestion, aliquots of the protein samples were mixed with equal volumes of sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For enzymatic characterization of thrombin-digested TC-Csk, the digested enzymes were stored at 4 °C and used within the same day. Storage of the digestion mixture at 4 °C for up to 1 day did not result in detectable nonspecific digestion or loss of kinase activity. To determine whether the two fragments produced by thrombin digestion were associated with each other, digested TC-Csk was purified by Ni2+-affinity column as described earlier. The purified proteins were compared with digested TC-Csk prior to this step of affinity purification to determine the co-purification of digested fragments. Ala Scanning Mutagenesis of the Csk Activation Loop— A comparison between active and inactive structures of Csk (14Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S. Nakagawa A. Nada S. Okada M. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14351-14354Google Scholar) indicated that many residues in the activation loop assume dramatically different conformations (Fig. 1B) in the two forms, suggesting the possibility that the conformation of the activation loop may correlate to the activation states of Csk. To evaluate the role of individual residues in this loop, all non-Ala residues were individually mutated to Ala. The kinase activities of mutants were determined using both poly(E4Y) and the kdSrc as substrates. Among the 10 mutants, most exhibited specific activity within 80% of the wt enzyme (Fig. 2). The most severe effect was observed in Glu338 → Ala, which retained ∼40 and 60% of wt activity using poly(E4Y) and kdSrc as substrates, respectively. In contrast, mutation of Asp332 of the DFG motif in front of the activation loop to Ala abolished the kinase activity with either substrate. These results indicated that none of the mutated residues in the Csk activation loop played any essential roles in Csk catalysis or activation. In other PTKs that are regulated by autophosphorylation, the Tyr(P) in the activation loop is stabilized by interaction with two Arg residues. The first Arg, which is equivalent to Lys337 in Csk, is critical for the autophosphorylation-initiated activation of v-Fps (21Leon B.C. Tsigelny I. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10078-10086Google Scholar), but our results demonstrated that Lys337 was not required for Csk activation. The second is an Arg from the catalytic loop, equivalent to Arg313, which is universally conserved. To determine whether Arg313 is required for Csk activation, we mutated Arg313 to Ala. Arg313 → Ala exhibited 87 and 108% of the wt activity toward poly(E4Y) and kdSrc, respectively (Fig. 2). This result indicated that the side chain of Arg313 was not involved in essential catalytic or regulatory functions. This effect directly contrasts mutagenic studies of Src and v-FPS, in which mutations of the equivalent residues to Ala abolished the kinase activities (21Leon B.C. Tsigelny I. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10078-10086Google Scholar, 22Senften M. Schenker G. Sowadski J.M. Ballmer-Hofer K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 199-203Google Scholar). The Csk Activation Loop Can Be Functionally Replaced by an Unrelated Activation Loop—Csk shares the highest overall amino acid sequence homology with PTKs of the Src family, but the two families share no significant homology in the activation loop. Src contains one Tyr residue in the activation loop, whose autophosphorylation activates Src kinase activity, and alters other regulatory properties (23Sotirellis N. Johnson T.M. Hibbs M.L. Stanley I.J. Stanley E. Dunn A.R. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29773-29780Google Scholar, 24Sun G. Sharma A.K. Budde R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1587-1595Google Scholar, 25Sun G. Ramdas L. Wang W. Vinci J. McMurray J. Budde R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 11-17Google Scholar). The Src activation loop is also four residues longer than the Csk counterpart. To determine whether the Csk activation loop can be functionally replaced by the Src counterpart, a Csk mutant with a Src activation loop (CSAL) was generated. CSAL exhibited ∼80 and 130% of the wt activity with polyE4Y and kdSrc as substrates, respectively, indicating that the longer activation loop can be accommodated and that none of the Csk-specific residues in the activation loop was required for the kinase activity. The Ala scanning and the loop replacement results indicate that Csk is active without the help of activation loop side chains. We then determined whether CSAL, containing a Tyr residue in the activation loop, could autophosphorylate and whether the phosphorylation of the Tyr residue could activate CSAL (Fig. 3). Incubation of the mutant enzyme with 0.1 mm ATP and 12 mm Mg2+ did not result in autophosphorylation higher than that of wt Csk. When incubated with Src in the presence of ATP and MgCl2, CSAL, but not Csk, was readily phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. This result indicated that the amino acid sequence in the activation loop contained the necessary structural information to be phosphorylated by Src, but not by Csk. The phosphorylation of CSAL by Src is also consistent with the trans-mechanism for Src autophosphorylation (26Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Google Scholar). No effect on CSAL activity was detected when the phosphorylation level reached ∼30% (data not shown). Probing the Conformational Role of the Csk Activation Loop—The apparent lack of a functional role by the activation loop contradicted our expectations based on its central location and the conformational differences between active and inactive Csk. We further probed the role of the activation loop by additional more aggressive mutations (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of wt and selected Csk mutantsEnzymekcat(E4Y)Km(E4Y)kcat(kdSrc)Km(kdSrc)min-1μg ml-1min-1μMwt34 ± 596 ± 22113 ± 2310 ± 0.5E338A6 ± 283 ± 1749 ± 710 ± 1.6Δ3390.6 ± 0.04106 ± 3221 ± 1024 ± 4GAL0.3 ± 0.0268 ± 916 ± 418 ± 7TC-Csk0.7 ± 0.0375 ± 136 ± 0.814 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab We determined whether the overall length of the loop was important by deleting Ala339 (Δ339). This mutant retained ∼1.8% of the wt activity toward poly(E4Y) and 20% wt activity toward kdSrc. Since the Ala side chain was unlikely to be essential for catalysis or regulation, this result suggested that the length or the conformation of the activation loop was important for full activity, but apparently more so for poly(E4Y) than for Src. This result suggested that although the activation loop was not part of the catalytic machinery, its conformation could have a dramatic effect on the activity of Csk in a substrate dependent manner. Since none of the side chains in the activation loop was essential, we determined if we could remove all side chains from this region and retain Csk activity. An all-Gly activation loop mutant (GAL), in which Gly replaced all 11 activation loop residues, was constructed. The mutant exhibited 1 and 14% of wt activity toward poly(E4Y) and Src, respectively (Table I). The differential phosphorylation of poly(E4Y) and Src by GAL was similar to Δ339 and further confirmed that the side chain functional groups were not required for catalysis, but the conformation of the loop affected the kinase activity in a substrate-dependent manner. Although the effects of the activation loop mutations were apparently substrate-dependent, only kcat values, but not the apparent Km values for the two substrates used, were significantly affected. This suggested that phosphoryl transfer onto these substrates, instead of the recognition of these substrates by Csk, was differentially affected by the activation loop mutations. The mutants displayed similar relative activity toward two other artificial substrates, RCM-lysozyme and GST fused to the optimal Csk substrate peptide, as toward poly(E4Y), suggesting that the mutants differentiated the physiological substrate from the artificial substrates. Csk Is Fully Active without an Intact Activation Loop—Since the activation loop residues were not required for Csk function, we wanted to determine the effect of cleaving the activation loop. A mutant that contained a thrombin cleavage sequence in the activation loop (TC-Csk) was generated, in which the thrombin cleavage sequence of LVPRGS replaced ASSTQD in the activation loop. TC-Csk retained ∼2% wt activity toward poly(E4Y) and ∼5% wt activity toward kdSrc (Table I). Fig. 4 shows the thrombin digestion on TC-Csk (Fig. 4A) and its effect on Csk activity (Fig. 4B). Incubation with buffer alone or thrombin did not cleave or affect the activity of wt Csk (data not shown). Incubation with buffer alone did not lead to cleavage of TC-Csk or significant change in its kinase activity compared with TC-Csk kept on ice. Incubation with thrombin led to cleavage of TC-Csk into two fragments at 38 and 12 kDa, respectively, the expected sizes when the thrombin cleavage site was digested. This cleavage activated TC-Csk, resulting in full recovery of the wt Csk activity toward both poly(E4Y) and kdSrc. This result indicated that the low activity of TC-Csk was due to a conformational effect, which could be released by thrombin cleavage, and that an intact activation loop was not required for full function of Csk. The two fragments produced by thrombin digestion were both essential parts of the kinase core structure (Fig. 5A). It was surprising that the two parts could still make up a fully active enzyme. To confirm that the two fragments were indeed associated with each other after thrombin digestion, the digested enzyme was purified on a Ni2+-IDA affinity column. Since only the 12-kDa fragment contained the poly(His)6 tag, co-purification of both fragments on a Ni2+-affinity column would indicate that the two fragments were associated with each other. SDS-PAGE indicated that the relative ratios of the two fragments were similar before and after Ni2+-affinity purification, thus confirming that the two fragments were strongly associated with each other (Fig. 5B). Examination of the crystal structure of Csk indicated that the two parts were held together by extensive hydrophobic interactions between the side chains on 3 α-helices: αE from the 38-kDa fragment and αF and αI on the 12-kDa fragments (Fig. 5A). PTKs of the Csk family are unusual in that they lack an autophosphorylation site in the activation loop, a regulatory mechanism conserved among all other PTKs. Considering the central location of this loop in the active site and well demonstrated roles of autophosphorylation in the regulation of other PTKs, we probed the function of this loop in Csk with some surprising findings. The Activation Loop of Csk Is Not Essential for the Kinase Function—None of the mutations, including Ala scanning, loop replacement, site-specific deletion, replacing all residues by Gly, and cleaving the activation loop, completely abolished Csk activity. The lowest activity toward kdSrc was observed for TC-Csk, at 5%, but digestion of the activation loop with thrombin restored the activity completely. Similar recovery of kinase activity toward poly(E4Y) was also observed, indicating that the low activity in TC-Csk, and likely in other mutants, was not due to the loss of any functionalities in the activation loop, but an inhibitory conformation. These results indicated that the activation loop is not part of the catalytic machinery of Csk, nor is it required for the catalytic machinery to be fully functional. Another important question is whether conformational changes in the activation loop do serve as a regulatory element in Csk, and if so, what regulatory signals can bring about such conformational changes. The SH3 and SH2 domains of Csk interact with and increase the activity of the catalytic domain (27Sun G. Budde R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 167-172Google Scholar, 28Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11147-11155Google Scholar, 29Shekhtman A. Ghose R. Wang D. Cole P.A. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 129-138Google Scholar). As discussed earlier, the active and full-length Csk and inactive Csk lacking the regulatory SH2 and SH3 domains have major differences in the conformation of the activation loop (13Lamers M.B. Antson A.A. Hubbard R.E. Scott R.K. Williams D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 713-725Google Scholar, 14Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S. Nakagawa A. Nada S. Okada M. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14351-14354Google Scholar). It appears likely that interactions between the regulatory domains with the catalytic domain can affect the conformation of the activation loop. Whether conformational changes in the activation loop mediate the SH2-SH3 regulation of Csk awaits further investigation. If the catalytic machinery between Csk and other PTKs are fundamentally the same, then these results suggested that the Csk activation loop was an evolutionally “basal” activation loop devoid of regulatory functionalities. The activation loops in other PTKs acquired other functionalities that allow them to interact with and regulate the function of the catalytic machinery. Based on this perspective, we propose the following functionalities for the activation loop in other PTKs. First, the amino acid sequence itself may interact with the catalytic machinery and act as an inhibitor. Second, the amino acid sequence surrounding the Tyr residue is needed to render the Tyr residue a good substrate for the kinase. Third, the phosphorylated activation loop needs to form certain interactions so the inhibitory interactions are removed. Finally, the catalytic machinery and the activation loop may evolve in a corresponding fashion, so the potential regulation by the activation loop can be accommodated. Mutagenic and structural studies of insulin receptor kinase, which is regulated by autophosphorylation, are consistent with these perspectives (30Till J.H. Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Kohanski R.A. Hubbard S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10049-10055Google Scholar, 31Frankel M. Ablooglu A.J. Leone J.W. Rusinova E. Ross J.B. Heinrikson R.L. Kohanski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4197-4207Google Scholar, 32Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Rusinova E. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46933-46940Google Scholar). These perspectives may provide a base line for dissecting autophosphorylation as a key mechanism for PTK regulation. Consistent with this proposal, the catalytic machinery of Csk appears to be different from that of other PTKs. Arg313 is universally conserved among protein kinases (33Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar), and the corresponding residue is essential in two PTKs that have been tested: mutations of the equivalent residue in Src (Arg385) (21Leon B.C. Tsigelny I. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10078-10086Google Scholar) and v-Fps (Arg1042) (22Senften M. Schenker G. Sowadski J.M. Ballmer-Hofer K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 199-203Google Scholar) resulted in inactive (<0.1% of wt activity) enzymes. But mutation of Arg313 had no effect on the Csk activity toward either the physiological or artificial substrates. This suggests the possibility that the role of this Arg residue has co-evolved with that of the activation loop: in PTKs that autophosphorylate, this Arg needs to interact with the phospho-Tyr for the kinase to be active; in PTKs that lack autophosphorylation, the catalytic machinery does not require the activation mediated by this residue. In Ser protein kinases, the equivalent residue also plays an important although not essential role. Mutation of the corresponding Arg residue to Ala decreased the kinase activity by 90% in yeast cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Arg209) (34Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8923-8931Google Scholar), and 80% in glycogen phosphorylase kinase (35Skamnaki V.T. Oikonomakos N.G. J. Protein Chem. 2000; 19: 499-505Google Scholar, 36Skamnaki V.T. Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Lowe E.D. Lowe G. Oikonomakos N.G. Johnson L.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14718-14730Google Scholar), indicating an important regulatory, but not a catalytically essential function for this residue. Some Csk Activation Loop Mutants Differentially Phosphorylate the Physiological and Artificial Substrates—Δ339 and GAL exhibited only 1 and 2% of wt activity toward poly(E4Y) but 14 and 18% wt activity toward kdSrc, indicating that the effect of the activation loop mutations are substrate-dependent. These observations raise an important question about the mechanisms Csk substrate recognition. Theoretically, there are two ways alterations in the activation loop could be propagated to other parts of the enzyme to affect the kinase activity. The first is by direct interaction of the side chains in this region. But Ala scanning and loop replacement results eliminated the possibility that the side chains in the activation loop are directly involved in regulation or catalysis. The second way the alteration can be propagated is by affecting the conformation of fragments that are covalently linked to the activation loop. The amino end of the activation loop is connected to the conserved DFG motif and the carboxyl end of the activation loop is linked to the p + 1 loop. The DFG motif is catalytically essential as the mutation of Asp332 → Ala abolished the kinase activity toward both polyE4Y and Src. The p + 1 loop is responsible for interacting with peptide substrates (9Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Google Scholar). Propagation of the conformational changes to either DFG or p + 1 loop would likely dramatically alter the kinase activity. Since the mutational effects were substrate-dependent, it suggested that the conformational changes in the activation loop predominantly affected the function of the p + 1 loop. Then how do such conformational changes distinguish the artificial substrates from the physiological substrate? One explanation is that the phosphorylation of the artificial substrate predominantly relies on its interactions with the activation loop and p + 1 loop, while the phosphorylation of Src relies less on such interactions. This implies that Src also interacts with Csk in regions outside the activation loop/p + 1 loop. This interpretation is consistent with our understanding of peptide substrate binding to PTKs (9Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Google Scholar) in general and consistent with the complex Csk-Src interactions that has been suggested by two lines of evidence. 1) Although Tyr527 in Src is an excellent substrate for Csk (18Lee S. Lin X. McMurray J. Sun G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12107-12114Google Scholar, 19Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Google Scholar), peptides mimicking the tail sequence of Src (19Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Google Scholar, 37MacAuley A. Okada M. Nada S. Nakagawa H. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 117-124Google Scholar) 2X. Lin, S. Lee, and G. Sun, unpublished results. or heat-inactivated Src (38Okada M. Nakagawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 796-802Google Scholar) are much worse substrates compared with Src or to the optimal Csk peptide substrate, suggesting that Tyr527 recognition by Csk relies on more than just the local peptide sequence. 2) Mutations of the residues surrounding Tyr527 of Src have only relatively minor effect on the ability of Src to be phosphorylated by Csk (19Wang D. Huang X.Y. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2004-2010Google Scholar). These observations indicate that some interactions that make Tyr527 of Src a good substrate for Csk are not located on the tail sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site, but in other regions of Src. Such a “bivalent Csk-Src” interaction model could provide a basis for the differential effects by the activation loop mutations. The nature and details of the Csk-Src interaction remain to be determined. Generous help from P. Lee at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for the generation of the CSAL mutant is gratefully acknowledged.

Brereton I.M. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Protein Sci. 1999; 9: 1797-1805Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), or 126–183 (17Raussens V. Mah M. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) are largely unstructured in aqueous medium. These results suggest tertiary contacts in the bundle conformation are necessary for maintenance of the α-helix conformation of peptides derived from this region of apoE. From other studies it is known that helical structure of the basic residue cluster within residues 140 and 150 is critical for normal binding to the LDL receptor (18Zaiou M. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Segall M.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon interaction with an appropriate lipid surface, substitution of helix-helix interactions for helix-lipid interactions preserves the helicity of this region and promotes adoption of a receptor-active state, possibly through greater exposure of basic residue side chains (19Lund-Katz S. Zaiou M. Wehrli S. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34459-34464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using an alternative strategy to study apoE peptides, Mims et al. (20Mims M.P. Darnule A.T. Tovar R.W. Pownall H.J. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Via D.P. Smith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20539-20547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) covalently attached a lipophilic anchor to apoE residues 129–169. Although this peptide was able to bind the LDL receptor when bound to an LDL substrate lipoprotein, the same peptide lacking the lipid modification was not. In other work Datta et al. (21Datta G. Chaddha M. Garber D.W. Chung B.H. Tytler E.M. Dashti N. Bradley W.A. Gianturco S.H. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Datta G. Garber D.W. Chung B.H. Chaddha M. Dashti N. Bradley W.A. Gianturco S.H. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 959-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) attached apoE residues 141–150 to an idealized, synthetic lipid binding peptide, producing a fused peptide that was capable of binding to LDL and very low density lipoprotein, thereby enhancing cellular uptake and degradation of these particles via a heparan sulfate proteoglycan-facilitated pathway. The peptide also elicited a decrease in plasma cholesterol levels in apoE knockout mice, although the effect was relatively short-lived. In the present study, residues 131–151 of apoE have been substituted for residues 146–166 of an unrelated model helix bundle apolipoprotein, Manduca sexta apolipophorin III (apoLp-III), creating an apolipoprotein chimera that provides a helix bundle structural scaffold to preserve the α-helix structure of apoE residues 131–151 in the absence of lipid (23Wang J. Gagne S. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17912-17921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The hybrid apolipoprotein retains physicochemical and functional characteristics of apoLp-III, yet manifests the heparin and LDL receptor binding characteristics of apoE. Materials—Bovine serum albumin, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), trifluoroethanol (TFE), and Bacillus cereus phospholipase C (PL-C) were obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was obtained from Bio-Whittaker (Walkersville, MD), and fetal bovine serum and lipoprotein-deficient serum were obtained from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Human LDL was isolated from the blood of healthy male volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation between the density limits of 1.019 and 1.063 g/ml. LDL was radioiodinated according to Langer et al. (25Langer T. Strober W. Levy R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 1528-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the 125I-LDL was at least 100 cpm/ng LDL protein. Recombinant apoE3-NT (N-terminal domain residues 1–183) was prepared as described previously (26Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) whereas M. sexta apoLp-III was prepared according to Ryan et al. (27Ryan R.O. Schieve D.S. Wientzek M. Narayanaswami V. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Agellon L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1066-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid Vector Construction—The human apoE3-NT/pET plasmid (26Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) served as the template for amplification of the nucleotide sequence encoding residues 131–151 of apoE. Oligonucleotides containing nonannealing StuI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites served as primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the apoE cDNA fragment. Subsequently, the coding sequence of M. sexta apoLp-III was amplified using the apoLp-III/pET plasmid as template (27Ryan R.O. Schieve D.S. Wientzek M. Narayanaswami V. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Agellon L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1066-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cDNAs were digested with StuI and HindIII. The apoE cDNA digestion product was subcloned into the digested apoLp-III/pET vector. The resulting plasmid construct included the coding sequence for residues 1–145 of apoLp-III followed directly by the nucleotide sequence encoding residues 131–151 of apoE. Thus, in the hybrid apolipoprotein construct, nucleotides encoding residues 146–166 of apoLp-III were replaced by nucleotides encoding residues 131–151 of apoE. The sequence of the hybrid vector construct was verified by DNA sequencing. For bacterial expression, the hybrid apolipoprotein coding sequence was cloned into the pTYB2 vector (New England Biolabs). Oligonucleotides containing non-annealing NdeI and SmaI restriction sites served as primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the hybrid apolipoprotein coding sequence in the pET vector. The amplified product was ligated into the pTYB2 vector at its unique NdeI and SmaI restriction sites, downstream of the T7 promoter, in-frame with the translation start codon and the vector-encoded intein/chitin binding domain fusion protein sequence, producing the hybrid apolipoprotein/pTYB2 vector. The sequence of the hybrid apolipoprotein insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant Protein Synthesis and Purification—Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the hybrid apolipoprotein/pTYB2 plasmid. Saturated overnight cultures (grown in 2× YT medium) with ampicillin (50 μg/ml culture medium) were diluted 30-fold with medium (plus 50 μg of ampicillin/ml) and grown at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Following induction with 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were cultured for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA), and sonicated in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. After sonication and centrifugation, the soluble fraction was loaded onto a chitin-agarose column. Recombinant protein production utilized the IMPACT (New England BioLabs) system, wherein a ternary hybrid apolipoprotein-intein-chitin binding domain fusion protein is generated. Passage of the soluble fraction obtained from the bacterial cell pellet over a chitin-agarose column and washing was followed by an in-column overnight incubation with buffer containing 30 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature to induce intein-mediated self-cleavage and liberation of the hybrid apolipoprotein. Elution of the column yielded a single major protein of the expected size, as judged by SDS-PAGE. The hybrid apolipoprotein was further purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using an RXC-8 Zorbax 300SB column with a linear AB gradient of 0.5% B/min, where Solvent A was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and Solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Fractions were monitored at 210 nm, and fractions containing the hybrid apolipoprotein were pooled, lyophilized, and stored at–20 °C until use. The final product protein contained a vector-encoded N-terminal methionine and a C-terminal glycine residue. Immunology—Immunoblotting was performed after transferring separated proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto a polyvinyldifluoride membrane. The presence of apoLp-III epitopes was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against M. sexta apoLp-III at a dilution of 1:5000. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for the receptor binding region of human apoE3 (1D7, provided by Dr. Ross Milne, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, and 2E8, provided by Dr. Karl Weisgraber, Gladstone Foundation, San Francisco, CA) were used to probe the hybrid apolipoprotein for preservation of epitopes located within residues 131–151 of human apoE, both at dilutions of 1:5000. Analytical Methods—Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses were performed using a VG quattro electrospray mass spectrometer (Fisons Instruments, Manchester, United Kingdom). Protein masses were determined as the mean value of several multiply charged ions within a coherent series. The instrument was calibrated with horse heart myoglobin (16,951 Da). Isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis was performed using the PHAST gel apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). CD spectroscopy was performed using a Jasco J-720 spectrapolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) interfaced with an Epson Equity 386/25 computer equipped with Jasco software. Near and far UV CD spectra were obtained as described earlier (28Ryan R.O. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1525-1530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and deconvolution was performed using the Contin program, version 1.0, of Provencher and Glöckner (29Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Denaturation experiments were performed by observing the effect of increasing concentrations of urea on the molar ellipticity at 222 nm. The denaturation curve was fit to a sigmoidal shape to approximate the midpoint of urea denaturation. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 20 °C in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using absorbance optics following the procedures described by Laue and Stafford (30Laue T.M. Stafford III, W.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). 110-μl aliquots of sample solution were loaded into six-sector charcoal-filled Epon sample cells, allowing three concentrations of sample to be run simultaneously. Runs were performed at 14,000 and 18,000 rpm, and each speed was maintained until there was no significant difference in r2/2 versus absorbance scans taken 2 h apart to ensure that equilibrium was achieved. The sedimentation equilibrium data were evaluated using the NONLIN program, which incorporates a nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting algorithm described by Johnson et al. (31Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). This program allows for analysis of both single and multiple data files. Data can be fit to either a single ideal species model or models containing up to four associating species, depending on which parameters are permitted to vary during the fitting routine. The protein's partial specific volume and the solvent density were estimated using the SEDNTERP program, which incorporates calculations detailed by Laue et al. (32Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1991: 90-125Google Scholar). Heparin Binding Studies—Hybrid apolipoprotein, M. sexta apoLp-III, and apoE3-NT were dissolved in buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) and applied to a 1-ml HiTrap Heparin HP affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). After loading, the column was washed with buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1.0 m. Lipoprotein Binding Assays—Human LDL (150 μg protein) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was incubated with 80 milliunits of B. cereus PL-C at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 30 μg of WT apoLp-III or hybrid apolipoprotein. Sample absorbance was measured at 340 nm in a Spectromax 250 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) as a function of time. Phospholipid Vesicle Transformation Assays—Bilayer vesicles of DMPC were prepared by extrusion as described elsewhere (33Weers P.M.M. Narayanaswami V. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. DMPC (125 μg) and an equal amount of protein were mixed in a final volume of 250 μl using a microcuvette equilibrated at 24 °C. Sample light scattering intensity was measured on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B luminescence spectrometer, with the excitation and emission monochromators set at 612 nm using a slit width of 3 nm. ANS Dye Binding—Fluorescent dye binding experiments with 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA using 250 μm ANS alone or in the presence of 5 μm apoE3-NT, M. sexta apoLp-III, or hybrid apolipoprotein. Excitation was set at 395 nm, and emission was monitored between 400 and 600 nm using a slit width of 6 nm. LDL Receptor Binding Assay—Human skin fibroblasts were grown to ∼60% confluence in the presence of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Fibroblasts were then grown to 100% confluence in DMEM with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum. At confluence, cells were cooled on ice for 30 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free albumin (FAFA), and then incubated with DMEM containing 1 mg/ml FAFA, 2 μg/ml 125I-LDL, and different amounts of receptor binding competitor for 2 h at 4 °C. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed five times with chilled phosphate-buffered saline-FAFA and two times with chilled phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were released from the surface of the dishes by incubation with 0.1 N NaOH for 1 h at 24 °C, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured on a Cobra II Auto-Gamma Counter. Cell protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Design of the Hybrid Apolipoprotein—The three-dimensional structures of M. sexta apoLp-III (23Wang J. Gagne S. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17912-17921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Wang J. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and human apoE3-NT (10Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were utilized in the design of an apolipoprotein chimera. apoLp-III is a 166-amino acid protein composed of five amphipathic α-helices that adopt a globular helix bundle molecular architecture. The chimera was created by replacing the C-terminal 21 amino acid residues of apoLp-III (part of the fifth helix) with 21 residues from helix 4 of human apoE (Fig. 1). Whereas residues 146–166 of apoLp-III include five acidic and four basic residues (plus two histidine), residues 131–151 of apoE3 includes three acidic and eight basic residues (plus one histidine). The hydrophobic face of the apoLp-III segment is composed primarily of alanine and valine, subtending an angle of ∼120 degrees. On the other hand, the hydrophobic face of the apoE segment is composed entirely of leucine residues, subtending an angle of ∼100 degrees. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface in this peptide is clearly defined although the hydrophilic face contains multiple hydrophobic residues (e.g. Val-135, Ala-138, and Leu-149). Given these differences, it is expected that replacement of residues 146–166 of apoLp-III by apoE residues 131–151 will 1) introduce an increase in net positive charge, 2) increase the general hydrophobic character of this segment of the protein, 3) decrease the angle subtended by the hydrophobic face of this helix, and 4) increase the presence of hydrophobic residues on the hydrophilic face. Despite these differences, the hybrid apolipoprotein should provide a suitable protein scaffold for helix 4 of apoE such that the biological function of this helix segment can be studied outside of the context of the apoE protein. Bacterial Expression and Identification of the Hybrid Apolipoprotein—The hybrid apolipoprotein/pTYB2 vector was transformed into E. coli for expression of a hybrid apolipoproteinintein-chitin binding domain fusion protein. Recombinant hybrid apolipoprotein was liberated from the fusion via an in-column, intein-mediated, cleavage reaction. Analysis of the recombinant hybrid apolipoprotein product by SDS-PAGE indicated a relative migration that was comparable with WT apoLp-III (Fig. 2). Isoelectric focusing yielded an apparent pI of 9.0 for the hybrid apolipoprotein (compared with 6.0 for WT apoLp-III; see Ref. 34Kawooya J.K. Keim P.S. Ryan R.O. Shapiro J.P. Samaraweera P. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10733-10737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with an increased net positive charge in the hybrid apolipoprotein. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the hybrid apolipoprotein yielded a molecular mass of 18,777, in very good agreement with the predicted mass of 18,775 for this chimera. An immunoblot probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against M. sexta apoLp-III (Fig. 2, B) revealed that WT apoLp-III and hybrid apolipoprotein were recognized by the antibody, whereas apoE3-NT was not. In other immunoblot experiments, employing two mAbs specific for the receptor binding region of apoE (1D7 and 2E8), reactivity toward the hybrid apolipoprotein was not detected (data not shown). Characterization of the Hybrid Apolipoprotein—Far UV CD spectroscopy of the hybrid apolipoprotein in buffer (Fig. 3) indicated a high content of α-helix secondary structure (61%). Inclusion of 50% TFE (v/v) resulted in an induction of α-helix (77%). Near UV CD analysis (Fig. 3, inset) revealed a pattern of peaks and troughs representing the environments of the aromatic residues (seven phenylalanines and one tyrosine) in the hybrid apolipoprotein. The CD spectral data demonstrate that the hybrid apolipoprotein is folded in solution. To determine the relative stability of the hybrid apolipoprotein, the effect of urea on the molar ellipticity at 222 nm was determined. A single native <-> unfolded transition with a midpoint at 1.05 m urea was observed (Fig. 4). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments revealed that, unlike WT apoLp-III or apoE3-NT, the hybrid apolipoprotein self-associates in solution. A plot of apparent molecular weight versus concentration showed a range of molecular weights that could be fitted to a monomer-dimer-tetramer model. The calculated apparent average molecular weight from a global fit of the data was 30,309, a value that is between the monomer and dimer molecular weight.Fig. 4Effect of urea on the molar ellipticity [Θ]222 of lipid-free hybrid apolipoprotein. Indicated amounts of urea were added to the hybrid apolipoprotein in buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), and at each concentration [Θ]222 was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Heparin Binding Studies—A well characterized property of apoE is its interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Using heparin as a model for heparan sulfate proteoglycans, two heparin binding sites have been identified in apoE, one in the NT domain and one in the CT domain (35Cardin A.D. Hirose N.

https://openalex.org/W1968990080,"Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) has recently been linked to a variety of pathophysiological cardiovascular conditions including hypertension and diabetes. In this study, we report on the 50% increase in L-PGDS protein expression observed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). L-PGDS expression also increased 50% upon the differentiation of normotensive control cells (WKY, from Wistar-Kyoto rats). In addition, we demonstrate differential effects of L-PGDS treatment on cell proliferation and apoptosis in VSMCs isolated from SHR versus WKY controls. L-PGDS (50 μg/ml) was able to significantly inhibit VSMC proliferation and DNA synthesis and induce the apoptotic genes bax, bcl-x, and ei24 in SHR but had no effect on WKY cells. Hyperglycemic conditions also had opposite effects, in which increased glucose concentrations (20 mm) resulted in decreased L-PGDS expression in control cells but actually stimulated L-PGDS expression in SHR. Furthermore, we examined the effect of L-PGDS incubation on insulin-stimulated Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and ERK phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, we found that when WKY cells were pretreated with L-PGDS, insulin could actually induce apoptosis and failed to stimulate Akt/GSK-3β phosphorylation. Insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation was unaffected by L-PGDS pretreatment in both cell lines. We propose that L-PGDS is involved in the balance of VSMC proliferation and apoptosis and in the increased expression observed in the hypertensive state is an attempt to maintain a proper equilibrium between the two processes via the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation.

Recently, we demonstrated that hypertension is accompanied by increased insulin-mediated VSMC growth due to sustained mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity via a reduction of MAPK phosphatase-1 induction (3Begum N.

Although VSMC proliferation and apoptosis are areas that are under intense investigation currently, very little is known about the role of prostaglandins (PGs) in the control of these processes, and even less is known about the biochemical pathways that regulate them. Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) is responsible for the synthesis of PGD2 from the common precursor PGH2. PGD2 has been proven to induce sleep, inhibit platelet aggregation, inhibits nitric oxide release, induce vasodilation, and act as an allergic and inflammatory lipid mediator (6Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Tanaka H. Takahashi Y. Murata T. Kabashima K. Sugimoto Y. Kobayashi T. Ushikubi F. Aze Y. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Yoshida N. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Honda Y. Nagai H. Narumiya S.

Nishizawa M. Mori H. Ito S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PGD2 is also the precursor of 15d-PGJ2, a natural PPAR (ligand known to cause apoptosis) (9Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 89-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L-PGDS is considered a dual functioning protein because it also acts as a lipophilic ligand-binding protein, binding and transporting retinoids, thyroids, and bile pigments (9Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 89-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depending upon its glycosylation or phosphorylation status, L-PGDS migrates anywhere from 20 to 29 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Recent studies have linked L-PGDS to a variety of pathophysiological conditions in humans. For example, elevated serum L-PGDS levels after coronary angioplasty correlate with a decreased occurrence of restenosis (10Inoue T. Takayanagi K. Morooka S. Uehara Y. Oda H. Seiki K. Nakajima H. Urade Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); L-PGDS is secreted into, and accumulates in, the coronary circulation of angina patients (11Urade Y.

Nephron. 2001; 87: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); L-PGDS metabolism has been shown to be related to blood pressure and kidney injuries associated with hypertension (14Hirawa N. Uehara Y. Yamakado M. Toya Y. Gomi T. Ikeda T. Eguchi Y. Takagi M. Oda H. Seiki K. Urade Y. Umemura S. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); human L-PGDS mRNA is most intensely expressed in heart tissue, and the immunoreactivity of the enzyme is localized in myocardial cells, arterial endocardial cells, and the synthetic state of smooth muscle cells in arteriosclerotic plaques (12Eguchi Y. Eguchi N. Oda H. Seiki K. Kijima Y. Matsu-ura Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14689-14694Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); and laminar shear stress stimulates endothelial cells to produce PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 by up-regulating the expression of L-PGDS (15Taba Y. Sasaguri T. Miyagi M. Abumiya T. Miwa Y. Ikeda T. Mitsumata M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is felt that because PGD2 is known as an anti-aggregatory prostanoid against human platelets, L-PGDS may be up-regulated to protect against platelet aggregation in atherosclerotic blood vessels (16Whittle B.J. Moncada S. Vane J.R. Prostaglandins. 1978; 16: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that L-PGDS induces apoptosis in both LLC-PK1 pig kidney epithelial and PC12 rat neuronal cells, presumably via the production of the PPARγ agonist, 15d-PGJ2 (17Maesaka J.K. Palaia T. Frese L. Fishbane S. Ragolia L. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 1692-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Ragolia L. Palaia T. Frese L. Fishbane S. Maesaka J.K. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2623-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have also determined that phorbol ester-induced apoptosis is mediated by L-PGDS phosphorylation and activation by protein kinase C, and is accompanied by an inhibition of the PI3K/PKB antiapoptotic signaling pathways (19Ragolia L. Palaia T. Paric E. Maesaka J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C119-C126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report on the elevation of L-PGDS in VSMCs isolated from SHR and the stimulation of enhanced L-PGDS production upon cell differentiation. We demonstrate the differential effects of LPGDS on serum-induced cell proliferation and apoptosis in VSMCs isolated from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) versus normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. We also examined the effects of L-PGDS on Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation in response to insulin. We propose that L-PGDS is involved in maintaining a proper balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis in the hypertensive and hyperglycemic states. Materials—Cell culture reagents, including fetal bovine serum, were purchased from Invitrogen. SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot reagents were from Bio-Rad. Signal transduction antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody against L-PGDS was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent was purchased from Pierce. Western blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Porcine insulin was a kind gift from the Eli Lilly Co. Type 1 collagenase was from Worthington. The caspase-3 activity apoptotic detection kit was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—VSMCs were isolated by collagenase digestion of the aortic media from male normotensive WKY and SHR rats with body weights between 200 and 220 g, as described in our recent publications (3Begum N. Duddy N. Sandu O. Reinzie J. Ragolia L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Begum N. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C81-C91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VSMCs prepared from these rats were not contaminated with fibroblasts or endothelial cells, as evidenced by a greater than 99% positive immunostaining of smooth muscle α-actin with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-actin antibody. Subcultures of VSMCs were maintained in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Unless otherwise stated, cells were grown to 70–80% confluency and studied at passages 4–5 for all experiments. Western Blotting—Culture plates were washed four times with ice-cold PBS followed by the addition of cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2.0 mm EDTA, 2.0 mm EGTA, 1.0% SDS, 1.0 mm benzamidine, 2.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and pepstatin A. When phosphorylation was detected, PBS and cell lysis buffer contained 2 mm sodium vanadate and 1 μm microcystin at 4 °C. The plates were scraped, and the cell lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. Typically, 50 μg of protein was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.1% bromphenol blue, 1.0 m NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 50% glycerol, and 10% SDS, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with the proper antibody followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and subsequent autoradiography. The intensity of the signal was quantitated by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms. Apoptotic Activity Assay—Apoptosis was quantitated as described previously (19Ragolia L. Palaia T. Paric E. Maesaka J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C119-C126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) by the colorimetric measurement of caspase-3 activity as per the manufacturer's procedure. In addition, conformation of apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay as described previously (19Ragolia L. Palaia T. Paric E. Maesaka J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C119-C126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using the ApopDetek Cell Death Assay Kit (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). Apoptotic Gene Expression by Gene Array—Cells were grown as described above in the presence or absence of L-PGDS (50 μg/m) for 15 h, and total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Typically, 10 μg of RNA was used as a template for [32P]cDNA probe synthesis using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). The gene array membrane (SuperArray, Frederick, MD) was prehybridized for 2 h at 68 °C, and then denatured cDNA probe was added and hybridized for 15 h at 68 °C. The membrane was washed twice with solution 1 (2× SSC, 1% SDS) and twice with solution 2 (0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS) for 20 min each at 68 °C with agitation. The wet membrane was wrapped with plastic wrap and exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at –70 °C. Cell Proliferation and DNA Synthesis—Cell proliferation was assessed by counting cell numbers. After the specified incubation period, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested with trypsin, and centrifuged. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold PBS and counted with a hemocytometer. Growth rate was determined by plotting cell numbers over time in semi-log scale and extrapolating the slope. DNA synthesis was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (4Begum N. Song Y. Rienzie J. Ragolia L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C42-C49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMCs from WKY and SHR were grown to 70% confluence (5 days in culture) as described above. After a 12-h pretreatment with either L-PGDS (50 μg/ml) or buffer (0.1 m NaPO4, pH 7.4), the cells were treated for 15 min with insulin (100 nm) followed by [3H]thymidine incorporation for 3 h. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed, and the cell monolayers were washed sequentially with ice-cold PBS (three times) and once with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%). The cells were solubilized by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1% SDS, 0.1 n NaOH. The solubilized extract (700 μl) was added to 6 ml of scintillation fluid, and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry, was expressed as dpm/mg of protein. Protein Concentration Assay—Protein in cellular lysates was quantitated by the bicinchoninic acid method (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Statistics—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance and the Student's t test were used to compare the mean values between various treatments. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. L-PGDS Expression Is Elevated in SHR and Increases upon VSMC WKY Differentiation—Because L-PGDS metabolism appears to be associated with hypertension and vascular complications, we decided to look at L-PGDS expression in VSMCs isolated from WKY and SHR. Interestingly, L-PGDS levels were ∼50% higher in SHR cells when compared with undifferentiated WKY cells (Fig. 1A, lane 3 versus lane 1). Furthermore, upon differentiation (day 10), L-PGDS expression increased 50% in WKY cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2 versus lane 1) and slightly in SHR cells (Fig. 1A, lane 4 versus lane 3). Fig. 1B represents the quantitation of L-PGDS intensity corrected for α-actin expression. L-PGDS Inhibits the Exaggerated VSMC Proliferation Observed in SHR—To determine the effect of L-PGDS on cell proliferation, we measured total cell numbers by cell counting and DNA synthesis by [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to exogenously added L-PGDS. As seen in Fig. 2A, L-PGDS treatment had a slight inhibitory effect on WKY cell doubling. A 50% inhibition of growth, however, was observed in SHR cells after 5 days in culture with L-PGDS (Fig. 2B). Concomitantly, the 2-fold stimulation of DNA synthesis observed in the presence of serum, in both WKY and SHR, was completely inhibited in the presence of L-PGDS in SHR, but not WKY, VSMCs (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that the basal level of DNA synthesis was 3-fold higher in SHR as compared with WKY cells.Fig. 3Effect of L-PGDS on serum-stimulated DNA synthesis. VSMCs isolated from WKY and SHR rats were cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At ∼70% confluency the cells were serum-starved for 6 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with LPGDS (50 μg/ml) for 18 h in the presence or absence of FBS (10%), and [3H]thymidine was added to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml for the final 3 h. Cells were washed and the radioactivity counted in a liquid spectrophotometer. Values are expressed as the mean dpm/mg protein ± S.E. of at least three experiments, each performed in duplicate. * and **, p < 0.05 when compared with serum-starved and serum-containing controls, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of L-PGDS Exposure on Apoptosis—Recently, we observed the induction of apoptosis by L-PGDS in several cell lines (17Maesaka J.K.

Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2623-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because L-PGDS significantly inhibited the serum-induced proliferation of SHR VSMCs, we decided to examine the effect of L-PGDS on apoptosis in VSMCs isolated from both WKY and SHR rats. Fig. 4 demonstrates a 55% increase in the induction of caspase-3 activity by L-PGDS in serum-induced SHR VSMCs when compared with serum alone. Caspase-3 activity was not significantly altered by L-PGDS in WKY cells in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 4). It is worth noting that the absolute level of apoptosis, as measured by caspase-3 activity, was nearly 2-fold higher in SHR when compared with WKY cells and that similar results were observed using the TUNEL assay to measure apoptosis (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined the effect of L-PGDS exposure on the induction of known apoptotic genes using gene array hybridization. Exposure of WKY cells to L-PGDS for 15 h, in the presence of serum, had no effect on the induction of any of the apoptotic genes studied (Fig. 5A), whereas exposure of SHR cells to L-PGDS activated the expression of bax (coordinates C1 and D1), bcl-x (coordinates C2 and D2), and ei24 (coordinates C7 and D7), three apoptosis-related genes (Fig. 5B). L-PGDS Pretreatment Inhibits the Insulin-induced Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β and Induces Apoptosis in Insulin-treated WKY VSMCs—The PI3K pathway has been shown to be involved in the apoptosis of VSMCs (21Yano K. Bauchat J.R. Liimatta M.B. Clemmons D.R. Duan C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jung F. Haendeler J. Goebel C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Cardiovasc.

Previous work from this laboratory has linked both Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation to L-PGDS-induced apoptosis (19Ragolia L. Palaia T. Paric E. Maesaka J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C119-C126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Insulin, a known inducer of Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation, has been shown to stimulate proliferation and inhibit VSMC apoptosis (22Jung F. Haendeler J. Goebel C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because insulin resistance is a common phenomenon associated with hypertension (25Naruse M. Tanabe A. Takagi S. Tago K. Takano K. Nippon Rinsho. 2000; 58: 344-347PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to examine the effects of L-PGDS on insulin treated VSMCs. Fig. 6 demonstrates the induction of caspase-3 activity in the presence of insulin and L-PGDS in WKY cells but not in SHR cells. Furthermore, we examine the effect of L-PGDS pretreatment on insulin-stimulated Akt/GSK-3β phosphorylation. Fig. 7A demonstrates an approximate 2-fold induction of Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin (WKY, lane 2 versus lane 1; SHR, lane 5 versus lane 4). Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was blocked when WKY cells were pretreated with L-PGDS (Fig. 7A, lane 3 versus lane 2) but remained elevated in SHR, even with L-PGDS pretreatment (Fig. 7A, lane 6 versus lane 5). Fig. 7B represents the quantitation of Akt phosphorylation corrected for Akt protein. Similar observations were observed with GSK-3β phosphorylation. Insulin stimulated a 45% increase in GSK-3β phosphorylation in both cell lines (Fig. 8A, WKY, lane 2 versus lane 1; SHR, lane 5 versus lane 4). Pretreatment of WKY cells with L-PGDS completely inhibited insulin-stimulated GSK-3β phosphorylation (Fig. 8A, lane 3 versus lane 2), whereas SHR cells pretreated with L-PGDS exhibited no inhibition of insulin-stimulated GSK-3β phosphorylation (Fig. 8A, lane 6 versus lane 5). Both processes appear to be independent of the ERK pathway because insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation was unaffected by L-PGDS pretreatment in both WKY and SHR (Fig. 9).Fig. 7Effect of L-PGDS on insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation. VSMCs were cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures” in medium containing 10% FBS in the presence or absence of L-PGDS (50 μg/ml) for 2 h. Where indicated, insulin (100 nm) was added for 10 min. Protein lysates (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed for the 60-kDa phospho-Akt (pAKT) and Akt (A).

Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 85-89PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hall J.L. Matter C.M. Wang X. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), has been linked to hypertension and insulin resistance (28Marks J.B. Raskin P. J. Diabetes Complications. 2000; 14: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Balkau B. Eschwege E. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 1999; 1: S23-S31Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Blood sugar control has been associated with urinary L-PGDS excretion in Type II diabetics (30Hamano K. Totsuka Y. Ajima M. Gomi T. Ikeda T. Hirawa N. Eguchi Y. Yamakado M. Takagi M. Nakajima H. Oda H. Seiki K. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Uehara Y. Nephron. 2002; 92: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of hyperglycemia on L-PGDS expression in VSMCs. Fig. 10 demonstrates the inhibition of L-PGDS expression in response to high glucose (20 mm) in WKY cells. Interestingly, the opposite was observed in SHR cells, where growth under hyperglycemic conditions actually increased L-PGDS expression 2-fold. In this study, we examined L-PGDS expression in VSMCs isolated from normotensive and hypertensive rats and found a 50% elevation in L-PGDS expression in SHR compared with WKY controls (Fig. 1). Interestingly, patients with essential hypertension have a significant elevation in their serum LPGDS levels (14Hirawa N. Uehara Y. Yamakado M. Toya Y. Gomi T. Ikeda T. Eguchi Y. Takagi M. Oda H. Seiki K. Urade Y. Umemura S. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This SHR phenotype was maintained up through the sixth passage of our primary VSMC cultures, whereas subsequent passages had L-PGDS levels more comparable with WKY. We also examined the effect of exogenously added L-PGDS on cell proliferation and apoptosis and demonstrated the ability of LPGDS to significantly inhibit SHR VMSC proliferation (Figs. 2 and 3) and concomitantly stimulate SHR apoptosis (Fig. 4). Caspase-3 activity as well as the TUNEL assay (data not shown) were used to confirm apoptosis. In addition, gene array analysis confirmed the activation of apoptosis in SHR by the induction of bax, bcl-x, and ei24 (Fig. 5). We have confidence in the array technique because the negative bacterial plasmid controls (coordinates G1 and G2) as well as the positive actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase controls (coordinates G3 and G4 and G5-G8, E8, F8, respectively) all gave the predicted results (Fig. 5). These observations are also consistent with the increased apoptotic levels observed in target organs of SHR rats (31Hamet P. Richard L. Dam T.V. Teiger E. Orlov S.N. Gaboury L. Gossard F. Tremblay J. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 32Hadrava Tremblay J. Hamet P. Hypertension. 1989; 13: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that L-PGDS expression increased in both SHR and WKY upon differentiation, a stage of development known to have increased levels of apoptosis. Recent evidence suggests that arachidonic acid metabolites, namely prostaglandins, are involved in regulating cell proliferation. Inhibition of 85-kDa phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing membrane phospholipids into arachidonic acid, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of VSMC proliferation (33Anderson K.M. Roshak A. Winkler J.D. McCord M. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2, which is quickly formed from PGD2, is known to inhibit basic fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis in rat VSMCs (34Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S. Kawano Y. Demer L. Fishbein M.C. Meehan W.P. Hsueh W.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 also inhibits platelet-derived growth factor-directed migration (34Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S.

Inoue H. Taba Y. Ishida A. Abumiya T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in VSMCs. Similar effects have been observed with the synthetic PPARγ activator, troglitazone, which inhibits VSMC proliferation (36Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P. Graf K. Wuthrich D.A. Coats W. Faxon D. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), decreases the intimal and medial thickness of carotid arteries in humans (37Minamikawa J. Yamauchi M. Inoue D. Koshiyama H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1041-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibit the development of atherosclerosis (38Chen Z. Ishibashi S. Perrey S. Osuga J. Gotoda T. Kitamine T. Tamura Y. Okazaki H. Yahagi N. Iizuka Y. Shionoiri F. Ohashi K. Harada K. Shimano H. Nagai R. Yamada N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It is our hypothesis that L-PGDS functions to stimulate the production of these PGs and thereby inhibits cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis in hypertension and diabetes. The role of PGs in VSMC proliferation has also been demonstrated directly in SHR VSMCs. For example, the addition of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, leads to increased proliferation of VSMCs in SHR rats (39Ishimitsu T. Uehara Y. Ishii M. Matsukoa H. Ikeda T. Sugimoto T. Jpn. Circ. J. 1990; 54: 1546-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, the inducible gene responsible for NO synthesis in VSMCs, nitric oxide synthase, is inhibited by both PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 but not by PGE2, PGI2, or PGF2 (40Shirahase H. Kanda M. Nakamura S. Tarumi T. Uehara Y. Ichikawa A. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 2173-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, the effect of retinoic acid metabolism on cell growth has been investigated for its potential as an anticancer agent because of its ability to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation of VSMCs (41Takatsuka J. Takahashi N. de Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 675-678PubMed Google Scholar). In human coronary artery VSMCs, the antiproliferative effects of 15d-PGJ2 were enhanced 4-fold with the addition of 9-cis-retinoic acid, a retinoid X receptor ligand (42Benson S. Padmanabhan S. Kurtz T.W. Pershadsingh H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although this study (42Benson S. Padmanabhan S. Kurtz T.W. Pershadsingh H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) does not address the apoptotic state of the cells, it does demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of 15d-PGJ2 and retinoic acid in terms of the inhibition of VSMC proliferation. It is worth noting that in addition to its function as the enzyme responsible for the eventual synthesis of 15d-PGJ2, L-PGDS is also a retinoid transporter. Several growth factors have been shown to alter the balance between VSMC proliferation and apoptosis. For example, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell proliferation (43Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Bai et al. (44Bai H. Pollman M.J. Inishi Y. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have shown that apoptosis is prevented by IGF-1 via the PI3K signaling pathway, which inactivates the proapoptotic gene, Bad, by phosphorylation presumably via Akt. In addition, protein kinase C and p38 MAPK activation have been reported to cause an increase in PG formation (45Molina-Holgado E. Ortiz S. Molina-Holgado F. Guaza C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and elevated protein kinase C levels have also been reported in VSMCs of diabetic rats (46Xia P. Kramer R.M. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have observed the decreased activation of PI3K (3Begum N. Duddy N. Sandu O. Reinzie J. Ragolia L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and increased p38 MAPK activation and phosphorylation in VSMCs isolated from SHR rats (47Begum N. Ragolia L. Rienzie J. McCarthy M. Duddy N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25164-25170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our present results suggest that when VSMCs are in a hyperproliferative state, such as in serum-induced SHR or upon differentiation, L-PGDS expression is elevated to inhibit cell proliferation and stimulate cellular apoptosis. It is only when proliferation pathways are active that L-PGDS can induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation. This is consistent with our previous findings in other cell lines, where L-PGDS-induced apoptosis is more pronounced in the presence of serum (19Ragolia L. Palaia T. Paric E. Maesaka J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C119-C126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, L-PGDS pretreatment appears to inhibit insulin-stimulated proliferation by blocking any further Akt/GSK-3β phosphorylation in wild-type VSMCs (Figs. 7 and 8), inducing a beneficial “insulin resistance” environment. L-PGDS may act as a moderator for the effects of insulin on cell proliferation and apoptosis, and it may help control WKY proliferation, despite the presence of insulin. This observation is made in differentiated WKY VSMCs, which express significant levels of L-PGDS. It appears that these L-PGDS effects are independent of the ERK pathway, because there was no effect on ERK phosphorylation. Future studies will investigate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38/MAPK pathways in more depth. Hyperglycemia, another condition favoring hyperproliferation, has been shown to decrease apoptosis of wild-type VSMCs (27Hall J.L. Matter C.M. Wang X. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results involving hyperglycemia (Fig. 10) also support the proapoptotic role for L-PGDS under growth-stimulated conditions. When WKY cells were incubated in high glucose, LPGDS expression decreased, consistent with the decrease in apoptosis, and increased cell proliferation observed under hyperglycemic conditions. SHR VSMCs actually increased L-PGDS expression (Fig. 10), possibly to help control the hyperproliferation that already exists in this cell line. In the present study, we report the elevation of L-PGDS in VSMCs isolated from SHR and its further increase upon VSMC differentiation. We demonstrate differential effects of L-PGDS on serum- and insulin-induced cell proliferation and apoptosis in VSMCs isolated from SHR versus normotensive controls. In addition, we examined the effects of L-PGDS on Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation. We hypothesize that increased LPGDS expression and secretion is a cellular mechanism to inhibit cell proliferation and stimulate apoptosis in the hypertensive and hyperglycemic pathogenic states. Therefore, we believe that L-PGDS represents a potential therapeutic site in the treatment of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2149738031,"The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plays an important role in the regulation of the fibrinolytic activity in blood. In plasma, PAI-1 circulates mainly in the active conformation. However, PAI-1 spontaneously converts to a latent conformation. This conversion comprises drastic conformational changes in both the distal and the proximal hinge region of the reactive center loop. To study the functional and conformational rearrangements associated solely with the mobility of the proximal hinge, disulfide bonds were introduced to immobilize the distal hinge region. These mutants exhibited specific activities comparable with that of PAI-1-wt. However, the engineered disulfide bond had a major effect on the conformational and associated functional transitions. Strikingly, in contrast to PAI-1-wt, inactivation of these mutants yielded a virtually complete conversion to a substrate-like conformation. Comparison of the digestion pattern (with trypsin and elastase) of the mutants and PAI-1-wt revealed that the inactivated mutants have a conformation differing from that of latent and active PAI-1-wt. Unique trypsinsusceptible cleavage sites arose upon inactivation of these mutants. The localization of these exposed residues provides evidence that a displacement of αhF has occurred, indicating that the proximal hinge is partly inserted between s3A and s5A. In conclusion, immobilization of the distal hinge region in PAI-1 allowed the identification of an “intermediate” conformation characterized by a partial insertion of the proximal hinge region. We hypothesize that locking PAI-1 in this transition state between active and latent conformations is associated with a displacement of αhF, subsequently resulting in substrate behavior.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; u-PA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; RCL, reactive center loop. is the most important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) (1Kruithof E.K. Tran Thang C. Ransijn A. Bachmann F. Blood. 1984; 64: 907-913Google Scholar). It plays an important role in the regulation of the fibrinolytic activity in human blood (2Van Meijer M. Pannekoek H. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 261-276Google Scholar). In addition to its role in fibrinolytic processes, PAI-1 has been demonstrated to be involved in a variety of other (patho)physiological processes. PAI-1 is a member of the superfamily of the serpins. The three-dimensional structure of these glycoproteins consists of three β-sheets, nine α-helices, and a reactive center loop (RCL, P16–P10′). Typically their active site comprises the P1–P1′ (bait) residues, located on the RCL, thereby serving as a pseudo-substrate for the proteinase (3Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar). N-terminally, the RCL is connected via the so-called proximal hinge (P14–P18) to β-strand 5 of the large central β-sheet A (s5A). C-terminally, the RCL is connected to s1C (i.e. the distal hinge region). PAI-1 is unique among the serpins because of its functional and conformational flexibility. The active conformation of PAI-1 inhibits its target proteinases by the formation of a stable, inactive complex. After the formation of an initial, reversible Michaelis-like complex, the proteinase cleaves the active site of PAI-1 and forms a stable, covalent complex resulting in the inactivation of the proteinase (4Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Google Scholar, 5Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Google Scholar). PAI-1, which has a high second order rate constant for inhibition of t-PA of 2.0 × 107m–1 s–1 is distinguished from other serpins by the facile insertion of its RCL. This property is thought to be responsible for the spontaneous transformation of the unstable, active form of PAI-1 with a half-life (t½) of only 2.5 h at 37 °C to a stable, inactive “latent” conformation (6Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Google Scholar). In this latent conformation residues P15 to P4 of the RCL insert into the β-sheet A to form s4A, and residues P3 to P10′ form an extended loop at the surface of the molecule (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar). Latent PAI-1 can be reconverted to the active form by denaturation and refolding (8Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2911-2918Google Scholar). Apart from their distinct functional properties, distinction between the active and latent conformations of PAI-1 can also be made based on differences in their proteolytic susceptibility (9Egelund R. Schousboe S.L. Sottrupjensen L. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 775-785Google Scholar, 10Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J.

Depending on the mobility of the RCL, the presence of co-factors (e.g. heparin) and the proteinase used, PAI-1 can also be cleaved in a substrate-type reaction, resulting in an inactivated inhibitor (12Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Google Scholar, 13Munch M. Heegaard C.W. Andreasen P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 29-37Google Scholar, 14Urano T.

Some serpins require secondary interactions for efficient inhibition of the target proteinase. Additional interaction sites between PAI-1 and t-PA that stabilize the reversible, initially formed complex have been suggested (8Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2911-2918Google Scholar, 16Chmielewska J. Ranby M. Wiman B. Biochemistry. 1988; 251: 327-332Google Scholar, 17Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Google Scholar, 18Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Google Scholar). The residues P4′, P5′, and P9′ of PAI-1 were assumed to be important for this interaction (18Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Google Scholar, 19Van Meijer M. Roelofs Y. Neels J. Horrevoets A.J. Van Zonneveld A.J. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7423-7428Google Scholar). As previously shown (20Stoop A.A. Eldering E. Dafforn T.R. Read R.J. Pannekoek H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 773-783Google Scholar), stabilizing mutations tend to be located in areas implicated in mobility of the serpin structure. The latency transition requires an additional flexibility, in which strand 1C is peeled away from sheet C and passed through the gate region (7Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Google Scholar). Overall, the stabilizing mutations can be grouped into five distinct subdomains of PAI-1, each of which has been associated with the latency transition: the vitronectin-binding domain, the helix F/loop subdomain, the helix C subdomain, the proximal hinge, and the sheet C/“back of the gate” region. Based on these five subdomains, the following model for the consecutive steps involved in the latency transition of PAI-1 was proposed. First, the proximal hinge region of the RCL would insert up to the point where s1C starts to peel away. Judging from the structure of the α1-antichymotrypsin δ-form (21Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-72Google Scholar), about four residues of the P region can insert without movement of s1C. To allow further insertion of the P region, the helix F/loop subdomain will have to move aside with concomitant conformational changes within the vitronectin-binding domain and the C-helix, whereas s1C (P′ region) passes through the gate region (22Kruger P. Verheyden S. Declerck P.J. Engelborghs Y. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 798-808Google Scholar). Finally, insertion of the remainder of the RCL takes place, resulting in the latent conformation. Based upon this proposed pathway, we hypothesized that immobilization of the distal hinge region (s1C) (a) might prolong the functional half-life of PAI-1, (b) might prevent typical latency transition (i.e. full RCL insertion), but (c) should not hamper the initial steps (i.e. partial insertion of the proximal hinge and displacement of αhF). Characterization of mutants in which disulfide bonds were engineered to immobilize the distal hinge region revealed that the functional stability is indeed increased and that a conformational transition occurs in which PAI-1 is locked into a transition state between active and latent PAI-1. Importantly, this “intermediate” conformation is characterized by a partial insertion of the proximal hinge and a displacement of αhF, resulting in altered functional properties. Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis and sequencing were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Pfu Turbo™ DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene.

Dr. Lijnen (University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) kindly provided plasmin. Trypsin and elastase were obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies raised against human PAI-1 were prepared as described previously (23Debrock S. Declerck P.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 243-246Google Scholar, 24Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Google Scholar). Recombinant human PAI-1 was produced in E. coli as described previously (10Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Google Scholar). 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates were obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA). SDS-PAGE for proteins was performed with the Phastsystem™ (Amersham Biosciences) using Phastgel™ (Amersham Biosciences) gradient 10–15% and homogeneous 20% gels. DNA was sequenced with the Automated Laser Fluorescent ALF® apparatus according to the protocol for the ALFexpress™ Autoread™ sequencing kit (both from Amersham Biosciences). The mutants were constructed using the appropriate primers and pIGE20-PAI-1-wt 2The style for the names of PAI-1 derivatives is as follows: PAI-1-wt indicates PAI-1 wild type. Derivative names with mutations are abbreviated so that, for example, PAI-1-P270C indicates PAI-1 in which Pro270 has been replaced by Cys. or pIGE20-PAI-1-variant as template. 50 ng of template and 20 pmol of each primer were used in the reaction. The PCR consisted of an initial denaturation step of 1 min at 94 °C followed by 18 cycles of denaturation (50 s at 94 °C), annealing (50 s at an appropriate temperature), and prolongation (10 min at 68 °C). The reaction was ended by a final prolongation of 7 min at 68 °C. Then 1 μl of DpnI was added to digest (1 h at 37 °C) the methylated parent vector (i.e. the template DNA). Subsequently 100 ng of PCR product was transformed in E. coli DH1λ cells followed by selection on agar plates containing tetracyclin (10 mg/liter). A single colony was grown overnight in 500 ml of LB containing tetracyclin (10 mg/liter), and the DNA was isolated using the Nucleobond™ AX 500 purification kit. Concentration and purity were measured by spectroscopic analysis. The presence of the mutation together with the absence of any unwanted mutation was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Expression and purification was performed as described previously (10Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Google Scholar, 25Sancho E. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the recombinant plasmid, pIGE20-PAI-1-mutant, was transformed in E. coli MC1061 cells, together with the pAcI plasmid, containing the c1857 repressor gene, coding for a thermolabile repressor. Isolated clones were grown overnight at 28 °C in LB medium with tetracyclin (10 μg/ml) and kanamycin (10 μg/ml) on an orbital shaker at 300 rpm. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown until the A580 nm reached 0.2. Then PAI-1 expression was induced by increasing the temperature to 42 °C. After 3 h, the cultures were centrifuged, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm glutathione, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin (final concentration, 2.5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (0.9 μg/ml), benzamidine HCl (203 μg/ml), antipain (1.3 μg/ml), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (52 μg/ml), and dithiothreitol (13 μg/ml)). Subsequently the cells were disrupted in a standard French Pressure 20K (Aminco, Urbana, IL) cell. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The obtained supernatant was immediately subjected to purification. Purification was performed at 4 °C using ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. An SP-Sepharose™ Fast Flow column (30-ml beads) was equilibrated with a 0.15 m phosphate buffer containing 2 mm glutathione, pH 6.0 (buffer 1). The supernatant was diluted with a 0.15 m phosphate buffer containing NaCl and glutathione to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 m NaCl and 2 mm glutathione, pH 6.0, and loaded onto the column. After a washing step with buffer 1 containing 0.3 m NaCl, bound proteins were eluted using a 0.3–1.3 m NaCl gradient in buffer 1. PAI-1-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer 1, and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column (10-ml beads) equilibrated with buffer 1. The column was washed with buffer 1, and bound PAI-1 was eluted using a 0.2–1.2 m NaCl gradient in buffer 1. Alternatively, for the purification of the mutants containing two cysteine residues, glutathione was omitted from all buffers resulting in a higher extent of disulfide bond formation. PAI-1-containing fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE for evaluation of their purity, pooled, and stored in aliquots at–20 °C until use. The amount of PAI-1 protein in purified preparations was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm (absorbance coefficient A1cm1%=10). Separation of oxidized and reduced forms was done on Activated Thiol-Sepharose™ 4B. The PAI-1-containing sample (1.5 ml, 750 μg/ml) was applied in binding buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) on a 6-ml column at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. After a washing step with binding buffer until the A reaches the initial value, bound protein (i.e. the reduced fractions) was eluted using phosphate-buffered saline with 15 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The nonbound fractions correspond to the oxidized form. Quantification of the Disulfide Bridges—Quantification of the disulfide bridges was done with a thiol and sulfide quantitation kit (T6060) (Molecular Probes). This kit provides a colorimetric assay for quantitating protein thiols, based upon a method reported by Singh et al. (26Singh R. Blattler W.A. Collinson A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 49-56Google Scholar, 27Singh R. Blattler W.A. Collinson A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 229-237Google Scholar). PAI-1 samples were incubated with cystamine (final concentration, 2mm). This molecule permits the detection of poorly accessible thiols on proteins or thiols that have high pKa values (26Singh R. Blattler W.A. Collinson A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 49-56Google Scholar). Cystamine, a disulfide, undergoes an exchange reaction with protein thiols, yielding 2-mercaptoethylamine (cysteamine), which then reduces a disulfide-inhibited derivative of papain, stoichiometrically releasing the active enzyme. The amount of activated enzyme is then measured using the chromogenic substrate, N-benzoyl-l-arginine, p-nitroanilide. The calibration curves were constructed using l-cysteine. Alternatively, the percentage of oxidized forms was measured by SDS-PAGE because the oxidized form migrates slightly faster than the reduced form. PAI-1 samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) to a concentration between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ml. After adding SDS (final concentration, 1%) and heating for 30 s at 100 °C, they were analyzed by SDS-PAGE performed under both nonreducing and reducing conditions using 10–15% gradient gels. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and quantified by densitometric scanning with the Imagemaster™ (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of the Functional Distribution of PAI-1 and PAI-1 Variants—The PAI-1 samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) to a concentration between 0.1 and 0.3 mg/ml and incubated for 25 min at 37 °C (or longer as mentioned in the individual experiments) with the serine proteinases (t-PA or u-PA) at a 2-fold molar excess. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS (final concentration, 1%) and heating for 30 s at 100 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE performed under reducing conditions using 10–15% gradient gels with the Phastsystem™ (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and quantified by densitometric scanning with the Imagemaster™ (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (10Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Google Scholar). Determination of the Functional Stability—PAI-1 samples were diluted to a final concentration between 20 and 100 μg/ml using the appropriate diluent (containing Na2HPO4) to obtain a buffered solution with 45 mm phosphate, 70 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The samples were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at various time points. The remaining inhibitory activity was evaluated by incubation with a 2-fold molar excess of t-PA for 25 min at 37 °C and quantitative evaluation of formed complexes by SDS-PAGE (either silver-stained or Coomassie-stained) and densitometric scanning. The amount of active PAI-1 at the various time points was expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of active PAI-1, and the decay was used for calculation of the half-life. Because of the slow reactivity between t-PA and PAI-1-P270C-A348C, u-PA instead of t-PA was used in the analysis of this mutant and the two respective single mutants. Kinetic Analysis of the Inhibition of t-PA and u-PA by PAI-1 and PAI-1 Variants—The rate of inhibition of t-PA and u-PA by PAI-1 and PAI-1 variants was determined as described (28Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12662-12666Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, u-PA and t-PA were used at concentrations of 0.14 nm and PAI-1 and its variants at concentrations of 0.8 nm (pseudo first order conditions). Samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 s, and the reactions were blocked by the addition of the monoclonal antibody MA-56A7C10 (for t-PA) or MA-8H9D4 (for u-PA) (28Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12662-12666Google Scholar) at a 100-fold molar excess. Both antibodies inhibit PAI-1 activity very rapidly and completely, without interference on the t-PA or the u-PA activity assay used to quantify residual t-PA or u-PA activity (29Verheijen J.H. Chang G.T. Kluft C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 51: 392-395Google Scholar, 30Bijnens A.P. Ngo T.H. Gils A. Dewaele J. Knockaert I. Stassen J.M. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 866-874Google Scholar). Second order rate constants were then determined as described (28Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12662-12666Google Scholar). The rate of inhibition of the serine proteinases by slow reacting mutants (i.e. PAI-1-P270C-A348C and PAI-1-R271C-E350C) was determined by evaluation of complex formation using SDS-PAGE. Therefore these PAI-1 variants (150 μg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C with a 2-fold molar excess of the serine proteinase, and the formation of the covalent complex followed. Samples were taken at 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, 240, 420, 1200, and 2400 min. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS (final concentration, 1%) and heating for 30 s at 100 °C. The rate of complex formation was determined using a one-phase exponential association, allowing calculation of the rate of inhibition (k = ln2/(t½ × concentration of serine proteinase)). Trypsin and Elastase Digestion—PAI-1 samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to a concentration between 20 and 50 μg/ml. Trypsin or elastase were added at a proteinase:PAI-1 ratio of 1:10, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C. At different time intervals between 0 and 240 min, a sample was removed, and the reaction was terminated by adding SDS (final concentration, 1%) and heating for 30 s at 100 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE performed under reducing conditions using 10–15% gradient gels and silver staining. The exact position of the observed cleavage sites was revealed through N-terminal amino acid analysis of isolated fragments (Eurosequence, Groningen, the Netherlands). Heat Denaturation—Thermal denaturation profiles were determined as described (10Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Google Scholar, 28Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12662-12666Google Scholar). Briefly, PAI-1-containing samples were diluted to 20 μg/ml in 20 mm sodium acetate, 1 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 5.5, and incubated for 2 h at a constant temperature, ranging from 0 to 90 °C. Denaturated protein was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm), and the supernatant was stored on ice until analysis. Residual PAI-1 antigen was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using MA-31C9 and MA-55F4C12-HRP as capture and tagging antibodies, respectively. Residual PAI-1 antigen is expressed as a percentage of the initial value. The Tm 50% value is the temperature at which 50% of the antigen is precipitated. Under these conditions active PAI-1 has been shown to have a Tm 50% value around 50 °C, and the substrate form has been shown to have a Tm 50% value around 60 °C. In contrast, the latent and cleaved form show a high resistance to heat denaturation (Tm 50% > 90 °C) (10Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of differences was evaluated using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance; p values > 0.05 were considered not to be significant. Selection of Amino Acids for Mutagenesis—Taking into account (a) the possible effects of mutations on the activity and stability of PAI-1, (b) the orientations of the side chains in the three-dimensional structure, and (c) a maximum distance of 9 Å between two inserted thiol functions, the following disulfide mutants were designed (Fig. 1): PAI-1-P270C-A348C, PAI-1-P270C-P349C, PAI-1-R271C-E350C, PAI-1-V274C-I352C, and PAI-1-V274C-I353C. For reasons of comparison the respective single mutants were also generated, i.e. PAI-1-P270C, PAI-1-R271C, PAI-1-V274C, PAI-1-A348C, PAI-1-P349C, PAI-1-E350C, PAI-1-I352C, and PAI-1-I353C. PAI-1-V274C-I352C and PAI-1-V274C-I353C revealed a complete absence of activity and were not further characterized. Quantification of the Disulfide Bridges—Purified disulfide PAI-1 variants contained varying amounts of reduced and oxidized forms. Further purification to achieve isolation of oxidized forms yielded fully oxidized preparations (Table I). Using the colorimetric method, one could only deduce that over 86% occurred as an oxidized form consequent to limitations of the sensitivity of the method in combination with used protein concentrations. However, data from the SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that no detectable levels of reduced forms were present.Table IEvaluation of percentage oxidized form in Thiol-Sepharose-purified preparationsPAI-1 variantAmount oxidizedThiol and Sulfide Quantitation Kit®SDS-PAGE%PAI-1-P270C-A348C>86>98PAI-1-P270C-P349C>90>98PAI-1-R271C-E350C>92>98 Open table in a new tab Determination of the Functional Distribution of PAI-1 and PAI-1 Variants—Incubation of PAI-1-wt with t-PA revealed the presence of the three typical functional forms (active, latent, and substrate) at relative ratios as expected (Table II, before inactivation). Also the single mutants revealed the presence of the three forms, even though for some at somewhat different ratios (Table II, before inactivation). Under these conditions (using longer incubation times where required to ensure a complete reaction) all three disulfide mutants also revealed the presence of the three typical functional forms. However, compared with PAI-1-wt the amount of cleavable material was significantly increased (26–28% versus 16% for PAI-1-wt, p < 0.05).Table IIFunctional distribution towards t-PA before and after inactivation at 37 °CPAI-1 variantConformationaExpressed as percentages of total PAI-1 protein.ActiveNonreactiveSubstrateBefore inactivationPAI-1-wt52 ± 132 ± 116 ± 0PAI-1-P270C63 ± 227 ± 110 ± 1PAI-1-R271C75 ± 45 ± 120 ± 4PAI-1-A348C49 ± 433 ± 318 ± 1PAI-1-P349C72 ± 415 ± 213 ± 3PAI-1-E350C28 ± 357 ± 315 ± 0PAI-1-P270C-A348Cb48-h incubation with t-PA.30 ± 343 ± 427 ± 2PAI-1-P270C-P349C61 ± 711 ± 328 ± 4PAI-1-R271C-E350Cc24-h incubation with t-PA.68 ± 26 ± 126 ± 1After inactivationPAI-1-wt<185 ± 015 ± 0PAI-1-P270C4 ± 383 ± 413 ± 5PAI-1-R271C2 ± 345 ± 454 ± 2PAI-1-A348C<174 ± 126 ± 2PAI-1-P349C7 ± 163 ± 031 ± 0PAI-1-E350C<183 ± 118 ± 1PAI-1-P270C-A348Cb48-h incubation with t-PA.<127 ± 673 ± 6PAI-1-P270C-P349C1 ± 215 ± 183 ± 3PAI-1-R271C-E350Cc24-h incubation with t-PA.,dSimilar data were obtained after a 25-min incubation with t-PA.1 ± 118 ± 480 ± 5a Expressed as percentages of total PAI-1 protein.b 48-h incubation with t-PA.c 24-h incubation with t-PA.d Similar data were obtained after a 25-min incubation with t-PA. Open table in a new tab As expected, the inactivation of PAI-1-wt at 37 °C resulted in the formation of 85% latent PAI-1, whereas the amount of substrate remained unchanged. A similar shift in functional behavior was seen for the single mutants, except for PAI-1-R271C and PAI-1-P349C, which showed a 2–3-fold increased substrate behavior. In contrast, inactivation of the disulfide mutants at 37 °C was mainly associated with a significant increase in substrate behavior (73–83% versus 15% for PAI-1-wt, p < 0.005; Table II, after inactivation). It was also observed that cleavage of PAI-1-wt, PAI-1-P270C-P349C, and PAI-1-R271C-E350C is completed after 25 min, compatible with the determined rates of cleavage (i"

The structures of the enzyme from Thermus thermophilus HB8 complexed with intact ATP and substrates (citrulline and aspartate) and with AMP and product (argininosuccinate) have been determined at 2.1- and 2.0-Å resolution, respectively. The enzyme does not show the ATP-induced domain rotation observed in the enzyme from Escherichia coli. In the enzyme-substrate complex, the reaction sites of ATP and the bound substrates are adjacent and are sufficiently close for the reaction to proceed without the large conformational change at the domain level. The mobility of the triphosphate group in ATP and the side chain of citrulline play an important role in the catalytic action. The protonated amino group of the bound aspartate interacts with the α-phosphate of ATP and the ureido group of citrulline, thus stimulating the adenylation of citrulline.

The stereochemistry of the catalysis of the enzyme is clarified on the basis of the structures of tAsS (argininosuccinate synthetase from T. thermophilus HB8) complexes. In prokaryotes, an arginine is synthesized by eight-step reactions (arginine biosynthetic pathway) using glutamate as a starting material (1Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 314-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glutamate is converted to ornithine by five-step reactions, and the ornithine then enters into the urea cycle to produce arginine in three-step reactions. Argininosuccinate synthetase (AsS) 1The abbreviations used are: AsS, argininosuccinate synthetase; eAsS, argininosuccinate synthetase from E. coli; tAsS, argininosuccinate synthetase from T. thermophilus HB8; AMP-PNP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate; r.m.s., root mean square. catalyzes the seventh step of the arginine biosynthesis (the second step of the urea cycle). AsS reversibly catalyzes the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent condensation of citrulline with aspartate (Scheme 1). It has been proposed that GMP synthetase, NAD+ synthetase, asparagine synthetase, and AsS have a common domain belonging to a new family of “N-type” ATP pyrophosphatases (4Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The domain has the modified version of the P-loop (PP-loop) of H-Ser-Gly-Gly-X-Asp-Ser/Thr-Ser/Thr (where H is any hydrophobic amino acid and X is any amino acid) specific for a pyrophosphate.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16146-16157Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) show that ATP binding domains are folded into the same open α/β structure, and pyrophosphate and the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP interact with the PP-loop in GMP synthetase and NAD+ synthetase, respectively. For the first time Escherichia coli AsS (eAsS) and its complex with citrulline and aspartate have been determined as the x-ray structure of AsS (11Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of the ATP binding domain (small domain) and the synthetase domain (large domain). The ATP binding domain of eAsS has the same fold as that of a new family of N-type ATP pyrophosphatases. A corollary of the ATP binding model to the active site is that a conformational change in the enzyme is necessary for the catalytic reaction. To confirm this proposal, the structures of eAsS·ATP and eAsS·ATP·citrulline have been determined by x-ray methods (12Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13074-13081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Comparisons of these two complexes with eAsS and eAsS·citrulline·aspartate revealed that ATP binding induces a rotation of the ATP binding domain toward the synthetase domain. Based on the structural elucidation of eAsS complexes, the observed kinetic properties were explained, and the catalytic mechanism of AsS was proposed. The structures of Thermus thermophilus HB8 AsS (tAsS), tAsS·ATP, and tAsS·AMP-PNP·arginine·succinate have been previously determined by us (13Goto M. Nakajima Y. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15890-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to show an overall structure similar to that of eAsS. No conformational change in the ATP binding domain was observed on binding of ATP and AMPPNP, implying that the reaction may proceed without the conformational change at the molecular level. ATP (or AMP-PNP) and substrate analogues are bound to the active site with their reaction sites close to one another and located in a geometric orientation favorable to the catalytic action. The mechanism of the reaction was proposed on the basis of the enzyme-substrate complex model. We have determined the structures of tAsS in the complex with intact ATP and substrates (citrulline and aspartate), in the complex with AMP and product (argininosuccinate), and in the complex with AMP-PNP, substrate analogues (arginine and aspartate) and Mg2+. The tAsS is shown to have the same overall structure regardless of whether the enzyme is in the native or the complexed form and to have a structure quite similar to (but with a slightly larger rotation of the ATP binding domain toward the synthetase domain than) that of eAsS·ATP·citrulline. The reaction sites of the ATP and substrates (citrulline and aspartate) bound to tAsS are adjacent and are sufficiently close for the reaction to proceed without the large conformational change at the domain level. The enzyme-product complex explains how the citrullyl-AMP intermediate is bound to the active site. The detailed stereochemistry of the catalysis has been explained on the basis of the structures of tAsS complexes. We now report x-ray crystallographic studies of the following three forms of tAsS: the enzyme-substrate complex at 2.1-Å resolution, the enzyme-product complex at 2.0-Å resolution, and tAsS·AMP-PNP·arginine·aspartate·Mg2+ at 2.15-Å resolution. Crystallization and Data Collection—The structural gene of tAsS was inserted between NdeI and the BamHI restriction site of plasmid pET11a. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE was transformed with the resultant plasmid. The enzyme was purified by incubation at 343 K for 10 min, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and a three-step procedure of column chromatography, first by a Phenyl-5PW column (TOSOH) with a linear gradient from 1 to 0 m ammonium sulfate followed by a Super Q-5PW column (TOSOH) using a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 m NaCl and, finally, by a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200-pg column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Crystallization of the enzyme has been reported elsewhere (13Goto M. Nakajima Y. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15890-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the complexes of tAsS were crystallized at 293 K by the vapor diffusion method (14Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) using 30 mg/ml protein solution and 2.4 m ammonium sulfate, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, as the reservoir solution. After 3 days, crystals had grown to dimensions of about 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.2 mm. Crystals of the true enzyme-substrate complex (tAsS·ATP· citrulline·aspartate) were obtained at 293 K by soaking the tAsS·ATP crystals in solutions containing 10 mm citrulline, 10 mm aspartate, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 10 min before data collection. Crystals of the true enzyme-product complex (tAsS·AMP·argininosuccinate) were obtained at 293 K by soaking the tAsS·AMP crystals in solutions containing 10 mm argininosuccinate for 10 min before data collection. Crystals of tAsS·AMP-PNP·arginine·aspartate·Mg2+ were obtained using a drop composed of a 1:1:1 ratio of the reservoir solution, the protein solution, and the additive solution of 10 mm AMP-PNP, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm arginine, and 100 mm aspartate. The x-ray diffraction data sets for the tAsS·ATP·citrulline·aspartate crystal, the tAsS·AMP·argininosuccinate crystal, and the tAsS·AMPPNP·arginine·aspartate·Mg2+ crystal were collected using a wavelength of 1.00 Å from the Synchrotron Radiation Source at the SPring-8 BL44B2, BL41XU, and BL40B2 (Hyogo, Japan). The crystals were mounted in a 0.5-mm cryoloop (Hampton Research) and flash-frozen in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K. All the data were processed and scaled using the program HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) (Table I). The three crystals are isomorphous with the native crystal (13Goto M. Nakajima Y. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15890-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and have average cell dimensions of a = b = 229.1 and c = 159.8 Å with the space group of R3.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—Refinement of each of the three complex structures was initiated using the coordinate of the unliganded tAsS as an initial model (13Goto M. Nakajima Y. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15890-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Model building was performed by the program O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The refinement was performed by simulated annealing and energy minimization using the maximum likelihood target with the program CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.N. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). All the subunits of the complexes were refined independently with 10% of the reflections excluded for the calculation of Rfree values. The Rfactor and Rfree values were decreased after several rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding. When the Rfactor value decreased below 30%, the sigmaA-weighted Fo–Fc map was calculated to assign bound ligands to the residual electron density. Water molecules were picked up on the basis of the peak heights (3.0 σ) and distance criteria (4.0 Å from protein or solvent) from the sigmaA-weighted Fo–Fc map. The water molecules whose thermal factors were above the maximum thermal factor of the main chain after refinement were removed from the list. The occupancy factors for ATP, AMP, and SO4 were refined because the temperature factors of these ligands showed values considerably higher than those of side-chain atoms of the enzyme. Further refinement cycles and model building resulted in the final values of Rfactor and Rfree as shown in Table I. The occupancy factors for ATPs range from 0.88 to 0.95 with a mean value of 0.93, those for AMP range from 0.82 to 0.89 with a mean value of 0.85, and those for SO4 range from 0.87 to 1.00 with a mean value of 0.94. Enzyme Assay—Enzymatic activity was measured by analyzing a phosphate derived from a released pyrophosphate using a previously reported procedure (18Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Measurements were carried out in the same buffer as that for soaking the substrates (100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm citrulline, 10 mm aspartate, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 8.5) at 293 and 343 K. The inorganic pyrophosphatase was added to the buffer to hydrolyze a pyrophosphate to produce a phosphate. The reactions were initiated by adding purified enzyme and stopped by the color reagent (0.045% malachite green hydrochloride, 4.2% sodium molybdate in 4 n HCl, Tween 20). The protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was corrected for ATP pyrophosphatase activity, which was measured independently using the buffer freed of substrates, citrulline, and aspartate. The enzyme has a specific activity of 0.06 ± 0.01 μmol min–1 mg–1 at 293 K and 0.92 ± 0.02 μmol min–1 mg–1 at 343 K. Quality of the Structure—The final model of the tAsS·ATP· citrulline·aspartate complex contains 1544 amino acid residues for all subunits, 4 ATPs, 4 citrullines, 4 aspartates, and 678 water molecules with an Rfactor of 22.6% at 2.1-Å resolution. The model lacks Pro-165–Pro-171, Phe-365–Gly-370, and Glu-396–Ala-400, and the average thermal factor of the main-chain atoms is 34 Å2. The final model of the tAsS·AMP· argininosuccinate complex contains 1544 amino acid residues for all subunits and 4 AMPs, 4 argininosuccinates, 4 sulfate anions, and 862 water molecules with an Rfactor of 21.2% at 2.0 Å resolution. The model lacks Pro-165–Pro-171, Phe-365–Gly-370, and Glu-396–Ala-400. The average thermal factor of the main-chain atoms is 30 Å2. The final model of the tAsS·AMPPNP·arginine·aspartate·Mg2+ complex contains 1538 amino acid residues for all subunits and 4 AMP-PNPs, 4 arginines, 4 aspartates, 4 sulfate anions, 4 Mg2+ ions, and 567 water molecules with an Rfactor of 22.6% at 2.15-Å resolution. The model lacks Pro-165–Pro-171, Phe-365–Gly-370 (Arg-359–Gly-370 in one subunit), and Glu-396–Ala-400, and the average thermal factor of the main-chain atoms is 32 Å2. All models were of good quality with 99.8% of the residues falling in the most favorable and additionally allowed region and only 0.2% in the generously allowed region when the stereochemistry was assessed by PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (Table I). Structure diagrams were drawn using the programs MOLSCRIPT (21Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Subunit Structure—tAsS, which has been overexpressed in E. coli, has 400 residues per subunit, with a subunit Mr of 44,815. The sequence alignment of tAsS with other AsSs by the program ClustalW (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) showed that tAsS has high sequence homology for eukaryotic AsS with identities of 52.7, 46.5, and 29.3% for human AsS, yeast AsS, and eAsS, respectively. The tAsS is folded into a tetrameric form with a noncrystallographic 222 symmetry. The subunit is divided into an ATP binding domain (N-terminal to Pro-165), a synthetase domain (Val-166 to Arg-359), and a C-terminal arm (Gln-360 to C-terminal) (Fig. 1). The fold of the ATP binding domain is similar to that of N-type ATP pyrophosphatases and has the consensus sequence of Tyr/Phe-Ser-Gly-Gly-Leu-Asp-Thr-Ser (PP-loop) specific for the pyrophosphate of ATP (4Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 5Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 1994; 20: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When the Cα carbon atoms are superimposed between subunits in tAsS·ATP·citrulline·aspartate, the average r.m.s. deviation is 0.14 Å with a maximum r.m.s. deviation of 0.16 Å. The corresponding average r.m.s. deviations of tAsS·AMP· argininosuccinate and tAsS·AMP-PNP·arginine·aspartate· Mg2+ are 0.15 and 0.13 Å, with a maximum r.m.s. deviation of 0.16 and 0.15 Å, respectively. In these complexes, the four subunits have quite a similar structure. The subunit Cα carbon atoms are fitted between these three complexes to give an average r.m.s. deviation of 0.15 Å with a maximum r.m.s. deviation of 0.19 Å, indicating that the subunit structures are essentially the same in these complexes. The subunit Cα carbon atoms of the native tAsS can be superimposed onto those of tAsS·ATP (13Goto M. Nakajima Y. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15890-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), tAsS·AMP-PNP·arginine·succinate (13Goto M. Nakajima Y. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15890-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), tAsS· ATP·citrulline·aspartate, tAsS·AMP·argininosuccinate, and tAsS· AMP-PNP·arginine·aspartate·Mg2+ within r.m.s. deviations of 0.14, 0.19, 0.19, 0.17, and 0.16 Å with maximum displacements of 0.88, 0.73, 0.95, 0.94, and 0.78 Å. Thus, the overall subunit structure of native tAsS is the same as those of its complexes. It was suggested that the cooperativity interaction caused by conformational changes may occur in the tetrameric AsS from bovine liver or yeast based on kinetics analysis (25Rochovansky O. Kodowaki H. Ratner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5287-5294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hilger F. Simon J.P. Stalon V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, no significant change in the quaternary structure in tAsS was observed on binding of the ligands. The eAsS shows the ATP-induced conformational change in the ATP binding domain, which is approximated to be a 3° (eAsS·ATP) and a 5° (eAsS·ATP·citrulline) rotation of the ATP binding domain toward the synthetase domain compared with that of native eAsS (12Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13074-13081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The overall subunit structure of native tAsS or tAsS·ATP·citrulline·aspartate overlaps well with that of eAsS·ATP·citrulline because the subunit α-carbon atoms of native tAsS and tAsS complex are fitted to those of the eAsS complex with average r.m.s. deviations of 0.63 and 0.61 Å, except for the loop regions, where the insertion and deletion of amino acid residues occur (27Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). However, the synthetase domain fitting by Cα carbon atoms between native tAsS or tAsS complex and eAsS complex indicated that the ATP binding domain in native tAsS or tAsS complex further (but only slightly) rotates toward the synthetase domain to close the active site (Fig. 2). When the synthetase domain α-carbon atoms of native tAsS and tAsS·ATP·citrulline·aspartate are superimposed onto those of eAsS·ATP·citrulline, the synthetase domain shows average r.m.s. deviations of 0.31 and 0.31 Å, whereas the ATP binding domain shows average r.m.s. deviations of 0.68 and 0.67 Å, respectively. The native eAsS presents a wider surface of the active site than native tAsS or tAsS complex and shows the induced fit for the ATP binding domain to move and bind ATP (12Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13074-13081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The tAsS does not show its overall conformational change upon binding of ATP or ATP analogue and has a common structure, i.e. a more closed form of the subunit than that of eAsS in the complex with ATP or ATP and citrulline, irrespective of the native or the complex form. There are four independent subunits in the asymmetric unit of tAsS crystals in contrast to one in eAsS crystals. The average numbers of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, ion pairs, and hydrophobic interactions per subunit are 10.5, 2, and 1.5 for native tAsS and 10, 2, and 0.5 for tAsS·ATP·citrulline·aspartate, respectively. The corresponding numbers are 27, 6, and 0 for native eAsS and 22, 6, and 2 for eAsS·ATP·citrulline, indicating that the closed form of tAsS observed in the crystals might not be due to the crystallographic artifactual intermolecular interactions. The thermophilic enzymes show increased rigidity at room temperature compared with their mesophilic counterparts (28Scandurra R. Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Politi L. Engel P.C.

Biol. 2000; 299: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the thermostable enzymes show a smaller domain movement compared with mesophilic ones (32Ura H. Harata K. Matsui I. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 73-78Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This assumption seems to be applicable to the behavior of the ATP binding domain of tAsS, which is different from that of eAsS. Active Site of tAsS in the Complex with ATP, Citrulline, and Aspartate—The stereo structure and the hydrogen-bonding scheme of the active site are shown in Figs. 3A and 4A, respectively. Three positive electron density peaks were revealed on the difference Fourier map based on the diffraction data collected using the tAsS·ATP crystal soaked in solutions containing 10 mm citrulline, aspartate, and MgCl2 for 10 min at 193 K and cooled to 100 K in a cold nitrogen stream. ATP and the substrates (citrulline and aspartate) could be modeled into these peaks (Fig. 3A). This result indicates that the true enzyme-substrate complex of tAsS is trapped and that its structure provides a structural basis for elucidation of the catalytic action of the enzyme, although the Mg2+ ion was not detected near the triphosphate of ATP. When the crystal soaked in the same solution for 20 min was used for data collection, the resolution of the data was lowered to 2.5 Å, and the residual electron density corresponding to the pyrophosphate moiety of ATP was separated into two diffused peaks, implying that the catalytic reaction proceeded (data not shown).Fig. 4Schematic diagram showing hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions of the active site residues in tAsS complexes. Putative interactions are shown by dotted lines if the acceptor and donor are less than 3.5 Å apart. A, tAsS complex with U-shaped ATP, citrulline, and aspartate.

B, tAsS complex with AMP and argininosuccinate. AMP and argininosuccinate are drawn by thick bonds. The α-phosphate of AMP is adjacent to the guanidino part of argininosuccinate. The argininosuccinate interacts with Thr-116, Asn-122, and Arg-124 similarly to those seen in A. C, tAsS complex with AMP-PNP, arginine, aspartate. The AMP-PNP, arginine, and aspartate are drawn by thick bonds. The Mg2+ ion is coordinated by three oxygen atoms of the triphosphate and three water molecules (W1, W2, and W3) in a tetrahedral geometry. The arginine and aspartate interact similarly with Thr-116, Asn-122, and Arg-124 to those seen in A. The interaction mode of sulfate anion is similar to that shown in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An extremely thermophilic bacterium, T. thermophilus, HB8 can grow at temperatures between 323 and 355 K with its optimum temperature being 348 K (37Oshima T. Imahori K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1974; 24: 102-112Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The tAsS in solution has a specific activity of 0.92 μmol min–1 mg–1 at 343 K, which is ⅕ that of yeast AsS (4.54 μmol min–1 mg–1 at 303 K) (38Chapman T.L. Shull T B. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The specific activity of tAsS drops to 0.06 μmol min–1 mg–1 at 293 K, indicating that at this temperature the subunit turnover number/min is about 1. The crystal seems to slow down the reaction speed to less than one-tenth that observed in solution. The enzyme-substrate complex was, thus, captured in the crystal. There are two conformers in ATPs bound to the crystallographically independent four subunits; one is the U-shaped conformation of the triphosphate observed in a b or d subunit, and the other is the S-shaped conformation observed in an a or c subunit (Fig. 3A) (12"
https://openalex.org/W1996357138,"10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) is composed of three domains and possesses three catalytic activities but has only two catalytic centers. The amino-terminal domain (residue 1–310) bears 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase activity, the carboxyl-terminal domain (residue 420–902) bears an aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and the full-length FDH produces 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity. The intermediate linker (residues 311–419) connecting the two catalytic domains does not contribute directly to the enzyme catalytic centers but is crucial for 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity. We have identified a region within the intermediate domain (residues 384–405) that shows sequence similarity to the central helix of calmodulin. Deletion of either the entire putative helix or the central part of the helix or replacement of the six residues within the central part with alanines resulted in total loss of the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity, whereas the full hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities were retained. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that neither of the six residues alone is required for FDH activity. Analysis of the predicted secondary structures and circular dichroic and fluorescence spectroscopy studies of the intermediate domain expressed as a separate protein showed that this region is likely to consist of two α-helices connected by a flexible loop. Our results suggest that flexibility within the putative helix is important for FDH function and could be a point for regulation of the enzyme. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) is composed of three domains and possesses three catalytic activities but has only two catalytic centers.

One of the major enzymes of folate metabolism, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) 1The abbreviations used are: FDH, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; THF, tetrahydrofolate; CHES, (2-[N-cyclohexylamino]ethanesulfonic acid; 10-formyl-THF, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate; 10-formyl-DDF, 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; CD, circular dichroism. 1The abbreviations used are: FDH, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; THF, tetrahydrofolate; CHES, (2-[N-cyclohexylamino]ethanesulfonic acid; 10-formyl-THF, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate; 10-formyl-DDF, 10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; CD, circular dichroism. is a natural fusion of two unrelated genes (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme consists of two catalytic domains, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal, connected by a linker of ∼100 amino acids (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol.

The amino-terminal domain of FDH (residues 1–310) can function as 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF) hydrolase and has sequence similarity to several other enzymes using 10-formyl-THF as a substrate (3Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

It reveals up to 50% homology to proteins from the aldehyde dehydrogenase family and possesses its own aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activity is the major metabolic function of the enzyme (9Kisliuk R. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 13-36Crossref Google Scholar). The intermediate domain of FDH (Fig. 1) seems to have no function except simply to connect the two functional domains (1Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the two domains produce the dehydrogenase activity only when they are combined in one polypeptide, whereas the mixture of the domains expressed separately is unable to catalyze the reaction (3Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggests that the intermediate sequence is an essential part of the enzyme that brings the functional domains into correct orientation to produce a new activity. The intermediate domain sequence as a whole has no identity to any known protein. A data base search revealed, however, that the fragment between residues 366 and 405 in the intermediate domain is 35% identical to a sequence from calmodulin-like protein identified in rice (10Xiao C. Xin H. Dong A. Sun C. Cao K. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The identity rises to 45.5% for residues 384–405 (Fig. 2A). It is interesting that in the calmodulin structure this sequence forms a long central α-helix that serves as a linker connecting two globular domains of calmodulin (11Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenbough T.C. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of calmodulin (12Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed that the helix is straight and is not surrounded by any other α-helices or β strands (Fig. 2B). NMR studies of calmodulin, however, have revealed a non-helical region at residues 78–81 (14Ikura M. Spera S. Barbato G. Kay L.E. Krinks M. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9216-9228Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been further shown that the central helix is disrupted into two helices connected by a long flexible loop (residue 74–82, Fig. 2C) (15Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Thus, rather than a rigid spacer, the linker serves more as a flexible tether between two domains, allowing them to swing around (16Finn B.E. Forsen S. Structure. 1995; 3: 7-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 17-64Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Movement in the central helix changes calmodulin conformation from an elongated dumbbell to a compact globular form (18Vandonselaar M. Hickie R.A. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Such conformational changes occur during binding of target peptides (15Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar), which is an important mechanism in calmodulin function (16Finn B.E. Forsen S. Structure. 1995; 3: 7-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Zhang M. Yuan T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although the similarity of the intermediate domain with calmodulin (Fig. 1A) is lower than with the calmodulin-like protein (36.4% and 45.5%, correspondingly), it is 63.6% in both cases if conservative changes are taken into account. We suggest that the “calmodulin-like” region of the intermediate domain with its flexible central part plays an important role in coupling the two catalytic domains of FDH to produce dehydrogenase activity. In the present work we apply a site-directed mutagenesis approach to explore the role of this region in FDH function. Materials—10-Formyl-5,8-dideazafolate (10-formyl-DDF) and 5,8-dideazafolate (DDF) were obtained from Dr. John B. Hynes, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of South Carolina. All media were obtained from Difco or Invitrogen. SDS-PAGE standards and Sephacryl S-300 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Generation of the Construct for Intermediate Domain Expression— The construct for the intermediate domain expression was generated in two steps from pRSET vector with cloned FDH cDNA (21Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This construct has a unique NdeI restriction site upstream of the 5′-translated region of the FDH, which overlaps the ATG start codon, and a unique ScaI restriction site on 3′-translated region, which overlaps the TGA stop codon. In the first step, the second NdeI restriction site was introduced into the vector immediately upstream of the intermediate domain coding sequence using site-directed mutagenesis. The sequence between two NdeI sites was excised, and vector was religated through internal NdeI sites. This approach has created an in-frame ATG start codon next to which was a triplet coding for the first amino acid in the intermediate domain sequence. In the second step, the second ScaI restriction site was introduced into the vector immediately downstream of the intermediate domain coding sequence using site-directed mutagenesis. The sequence between two ScaI sites was excised, and vector was religated through internal ScaI sites. This approach has created an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately downstream of a triplet coding for the last amino acid in the intermediate domain sequence. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate a construct for the intermediate domain expression and to introduce desirable mutations within the intermediate domain. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out directly on expression constructs: pRSET with cloned intermediate domain cDNA or pVL 1393 with cloned FDH cDNA (22Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids were isolated by using a Quantum Prep kit (Bio-Rad) and sequenced to identify clones carrying the mutation. The entire coding region of the clones carrying the mutations was sequenced to ensure the absence of random mutations. Expression of the Intermediate Domain and Its Mutants—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were transformed with the corresponding expression vector according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the cells were grown in 4 ml of NZCYM medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The 100 ml of NZCYM medium containing ampicillin were inoculated with the overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until A600 = 0.6 (about 6 h) followed by induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). Three hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The suspension was chilled on ice and sonicated (three times for 45 s). The insoluble material was precipitated by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 15 min). The pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of 6 m urea by continuous stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant and the dissolved pellet were examined for the presence of the protein of interest by SDS-PAGE. Purification of the Intermediate Domain and Its Mutant—After dissolving the pellet of insoluble cell fraction in 6 m urea, the sample (0.1 mg/ml protein) was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 18 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 15 min), and the soluble sample was subjected to the size-exclusion chromatography procedure on a Sephadex G-100 column (2.5 × 80 cm). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm NaN3. About 15 mg of protein was loaded onto the column in a volume of about 3 ml. Chromatography was carried out at 20 ml/h flow rate, and fractions of 4 ml were collected. The purified preparations were stable for at least 2 weeks when stored at 4 °C or for several months if stored frozen at –20 °C. Expression of Mutants of Full-length FDH—The expression of the full-length FDH mutants has been done in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as we previously described (21Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The vector carrying mutated FDH cDNA and linearized AcNPV viral DNA was co-transfected into Sf9 cells using the BaculoGold transfection kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant viral stock was amplified in Sf9 cells to produce high titer virus stock. High Five cells were seeded as a monolayer in 25-cm2 flasks (about 2 × 106 cells per flask) and grown overnight. Each flask was infected with 0.1 ml of high titer virus stock. Culture medium and cells were collected separately 2–4 days post-infection, and the recombinant protein production was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblot analysis. For large scale recombinant protein production, High five cells were seeded in 225-cm2 flasks (about 20 × 106 cells per flask), and after growing overnight each flask was infected with 1.0 ml of high titer virus stock. After 96 h cells were collected, spun down, and rinsed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm NaN3. Cells were resuspended in the same buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and were broken by freezing/thaw procedure. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction of the cells was used to isolate recombinant protein. Purification of FDH Mutants—Mutants of the full-length FDH having an altered intermediate domain were purified from the soluble cell fraction by size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 column (1.5 × 100 cm). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm NaN3. About 5 mg of protein was loaded onto the column in a volume of about 3 ml. Chromatography was carried out at 20 ml/h flow rate, and fractions of 4 ml were collected. Analysis of the Mutant Proteins—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar) in 8.0% or 15.0% gel. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford's protein assay (24Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of wild type and mutant intermediate domain was carried out in the Protein Core facility at the Medical University of South Carolina using automated Edman degradation with gas phase analysis on an LF-3000 (Beckman) or an Applied Biosystem 470A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) protein sequencer. Assay of Enzyme Activity—All assays were performed at 30 °C in a Shimadzu 2401PC double-beam spectrophotometer. For measurement of hydrolase activity the reaction mixture contained 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 5 μm of substrate, 10-formyl-DDF. 10-Formyl-DDF is an alternative, stable substrate for the enzyme (25Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme (1–20 μg) in a final volume of 1.0 ml and read against a blank cuvette containing all components except enzyme. Appearance of product 5,8-dideazafolate was measured at 295 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 18.9 × 103 (26Smith G.K. Mueller W.T. Benkovic P.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Addition of NADP+ to the reaction mixture provided a measure of both dehydrogenase and hydrolase activities, i.e. total activity of the enzyme. Hydrolase activity measured in the absence of NADP+ was subtracted from the total activity to give the dehydrogenase activity. Dehydrogenase activity was also measured independently using the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to production of NADPH and the molar extinction coefficient of 6.2 × 103. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was assayed using propanal essentially as described by Lindahl and Evces (27Lindahl R. Evces S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 33: 3383-3389Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with our modifications (2Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm CHES buffer, pH 9.4, 5 mm propanal, 1 mm NADP+, and enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. Activity was estimated from the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. MALDI Mass Spectrometry—Expressed wild type intermediate domain and its mutants were analyzed at the Medical University of South Carolina mass spectrometry facility using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). A time-of-flight MALDI (Voyager-DE STR from Applied Biosystems) was used in linear mode to detect average ion masses. Samples were prepared by mixing 1 part protein solution (0.5–2.5 μg/μl) with 3 parts matrix (50 mm α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). 0.5 μl of each sample mixture, containing 5–25 μmol of peptide, was then spotted and allowed to air dry prior to analysis. Fluorescence Studies—Fluorescence experiments were done on a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Emission fluorescence spectra of wild type intermediate domain and its mutants were recorded by scanning from 300 to 460 nm with fluorescence excitation at either 280 or 295 nm. Protein samples (0.1 mg/ml) were in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. All experiments were done at room temperature. Analysis of Conformation by CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra (190–250 nm) were obtained using Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) at a resolution of 0.2 nm with a bandwidth of 2 nm. For each sample, ten spectra were collected and averaged. The concentration of wild type and mutant proteins was about 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was determined using a calculated molar extinction coefficient (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded at 25 °C using cylindrical quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.02 cm. The protein spectra were corrected by subtracting a blank solution containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, and 10 mm NaCl. The final results are reported as mean residue ellipticity in units of degree·cm2·dmol–1 obtained using the calculated mean residual mass of each derivative. The spectra were analyzed using a method allowing quantitative calculation of the content of the secondary structure elements (29Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Prediction of the Secondary Structure—Predicted secondary structures of the intermediate domain and its mutants were generated by using the server of Biomolecular Engineering Research Center at Boston University (Boston, MA, available at bmerc-www.bu.edu/index.html) and the server of European Molecular Biology Laboratory (available at www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein). Expression, Purification, and Enzyme Activity of Full-length FDH with Changes within the Intermediate Domain—To study the role of the “calmodulin-like” region of the intermediate domain we have designed FDH mutants with deletion or replacement of residues within the region. Three constructs were generated (Fig. 2D): 1) with residues 394–399 deleted (6del); 2) with residues 384–405 deleted (22del); and 3) with six residues (amino acids 394–399) replaced with alanines (6Ala). In the first mutant we deleted six residues that could be responsible for flexibility within the putative helix. The second mutant represents protein with entire putative helix deleted. In the third mutant we have changed all residues that could be responsible for flexibility of the helix to alanines. The mutants were expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as we previously described (21Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All the mutants were expressed as soluble proteins. They were purified from the soluble cell fraction by using size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 (data not shown). All three enzymatic activities of FDH, i.e. hydrolase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and 10-formyl-THF dehydrogenase were assayed in the mutant proteins. We found that all three mutants completely lost the 10-formyl-THF dehydrogenase activity (Table I). At the same time two mutants, 6Ala and 6del, retained full hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities (Table I). The third FDH mutant, 22del, also possessed the hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, although at a lower level than wild type FDH (Table I): it retained about 73% of the hydrolase activity and about 56% of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity of that of wild type FDH. We refer this decrease in activity to the fact that this mutant apparently was less stable in solution than the wild type FDH. Indeed, it reveals a tendency to precipitate after several days if kept in solution at 4 °C.Table IActivity of FDH mutantsFDHActivity, % to wtFDHaValues represent the means ± S.D. obtained from triplicate determinations.DehydrogenaseHydrolaseAldehyde DH%Wild type1001001006AlaNDbND, non detectable.89 ± 7103 ± 116delND87 ± 978 ± 822delND73 + 956 ± 9K394A75 ± 1295 ± 14100 ± 9L395A80 ± 1075 ± 1295 ± 10R396A100 ± 14105 ± 15100 ± 10G397A100 ± 1680 ± 10100 ± 9E398A90 ± 1570 ± 12110 ± 9D399A90 ± 1285 ± 8105 ± 10a Values represent the means ± S.D. obtained from triplicate determinations.b ND, non detectable. Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Wild type and Mutant Intermediate Domains of FDH—We expressed and purified FDH intermediate domain corresponding to the original FDH sequence and intermediate domain mutants corresponding to the above mutants generated for the full-length enzyme (Fig. 2D). We found that the original intermediate domain and three other constructs were expressed as insoluble proteins. The proteins were refolded and purified from the insoluble fraction of the cell in one step by size-exclusion chromatography. Each of the four intermediate proteins was eluted from the column as single peak with apparent molecular mass of about 10–14 kDa (data not shown), suggesting that they were not aggregated in solution. All constructs for the intermediate domain expression had an extra nucleotide triplet encoding for methionine in an amino-terminal end that was necessary to initiate translation. Analysis of the amino-terminal sequences of purified proteins revealed that they do not have a terminal methionine and start from serine (Ser-311 in the FDH sequence). The first methionine, however, is often not retained at the amino terminus of the proteins expressed in prokaryotes (30Bradshaw R.A. Brickey W.W. Walker K.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 263-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Thus, the intermediate domain was expressed as an original sequence presented in the full-length FDH. Comparison of Wild Type and Mutant Intermediate Domains—We compared CD spectra of the intermediate domain and its mutants. These experiments were carried out to detect changes in the secondary structure elements within the domain induced by the mutations. CD spectra in the far-UV range reflect content of secondary structure components in the proteins with the strongest and most characteristic spectrum for the α-helix (31Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed significant shifts in CD plots indicating changes in secondary structure element composition (Fig. 3). The spectra were analyzed using a method that allows quantitative calculation of the content of the secondary structure elements (29Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Data derived from this analysis (Table II) revealed that introduction of alanine residues in the putative flexible region resulted in an increase of α-helical content with a decrease in random coil content compared with the wild type intermediate domain. These results indicate that the entire putative helix (about 22 amino acid residues) is likely to be straight in the mutant. The other mutant, 22del, in which the putative long α-helix was deleted, showed a notable decrease in content of α-helical region compared with the wild type protein. This decrease was proportional to the relative contribution of this fragment in the α-helical portion of the intermediate domain. Results on the last mutant, 6del, suggest that the deletion of the putative flexible region within the helix stabilized the entire helix, which probably becomes straight similar to 6Ala mutant.Table IIContent of secondary structure elements in FDH intermediate domain and its mutants calculated from CD spectraIntermediate domainα-Helixβ-SheetTurnCoil%Wild type32.4 ± 1.322.2 ± 1.618.0 ± 0.929.2 ± 1.46Ala48.0 ± 3.514.5 ± 1.915.7 ± 0.918.8 ± 2.06del38.5 ± 1.915.3 ± 1.917.1 ± 1.820.6 ± 3.222del26.9 ± 1.829.1 ± 2.319.5 ± 1.424.2 ± 2.2 Open table in a new tab To further explore whether or not conformational changes occur due to the introduced mutations, we compared the emission fluorescence spectra of the intermediate domain and its 6Ala mutant. The intermediate domain has one tryptophan and two tyrosine residues that allow one to measure its intrinsic fluorescence. We performed these experiments at excitation wavelengths of 278 and 295 nm. We observed significant differences in the fluorescence spectra of the mutant compared with the spectrum of the wild type intermediate domain (Fig. 4). There was stronger shift in the fluorescence maximum with an excitation at 278 nm (from 322 to 344 nm) than with excitation at 295 nm (from 332 to 341 nm). These results suggest that the tryptophan and the tyrosines become more susceptible to solvent in 6Ala mutant than in the wild type intermediate domain.

https://openalex.org/W1995802046,"Apo-p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase was reconstituted using 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxy-arabino-FAD, a synthetic flavin in which the hydroxyl of the 2′-center of the ribityl chain was replaced with fluorine in an inverted configuration. The absorbance spectral changes caused by the binding of either p-hydroxybenzoate (pOHB) or 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (2,4-diOHB) indicated that the isoalloxazine of the artificial flavin adopts the more solvent-exposed “out” conformation rather than the partially buried “in” conformation near the aromatic substrate. In contrast, the flavin of the natural enzyme adopts the in conformation when pOHB is bound. Much of the behavior of the artificial enzyme can be rationalized in light of the preference of the flavin for the out conformation, including the weaker binding of pOHB, the tighter binding of 2,4-diOHB, and the slower reactions involved in the hydroxylation of pOHB and 2,4-diOHB. Particularly noteworthy is the enhancement of the reduction of the flavin by NADPH when pOHB is bound to the active site, consistent with the recent finding that the reaction occurs when the flavin adopts the out conformation (Palfey, B. A., Moran, G. R., Entsch, B., Ballou, D. P., and Massey, V. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 1153–1158). Thus, whereas the change that induces the out conformation is detrimental to the oxidative half-reaction, it improves the reductive half-reaction, showing that the control of the flavin position in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase represents a compromise between the conflicting needs of two chemically disparate half-reactions, and demonstrating that the 2′-hydroxyl of FAD can serve as a critical control element in flavoenzyme catalysis.

Synthetic flavins have been used profitably as mechanistic and spectral probes in the study of flavoenzyme catalysis (1Ghisla S. Massey V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Flavins substituted at the 8-position of the isoalloxazine have been used to study flavoproteins by 19F NMR (2Macheroux P. Kojiro C.L. Schopfer L.M. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2670-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but the introduction of such an electronegative substituent alters the chemistry of the isoalloxazine. In an attempt to introduce a fluorine substituent close to the chemical center of activity yet leave the inherent chemical properties of the isoalloxazine unchanged, 2′-F arabino flavins have been synthesized in which the 2′-hydroxyl of the flavin ribityl chain is substituted with fluorine and the configuration of the 2′-carbon is inverted for reasons of synthetic expediency. The redox properties of the free artificial flavin are virtually identical to those of natural flavin (3Miller S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13066-13073Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting that the introduction of a probe nucleus at the ribityl 2′-position has no significant effect on flavin solution chemistry. Surprisingly, although the fluorine probe is chemically isolated from the isoalloxazine reaction center, the catalytic and redox properties of several flavoenzymes are significantly different when the natural flavin is replaced with the 2′-F arabino analog or other 2′-derivatives (3Miller S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13066-13073Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 4Ghisla S. Engst S. Vock P. Kieweg V. Bross P. Nandy A. Rasched I. Strauss A.W. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1993.

These important changes indicate that the 2′-hydroxyl of natural flavins plays an important chemical role as a hydrogen-bonding active site substituent much like a serine residue might. Thus rather than serving in their originally intended role as non-disruptive spectral probes, 2′-F arabino flavins have proven to be best suited for elucidating enzyme chemistry by altering active site interactions. This paper reports our studies on p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) 1The abbreviations used are: PHBH, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase; pOHB, p-hydroxybenzoate; 2,4-diOHB, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate; 2′-F FAD, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxy-arabino-flavin adenine dinucleotide; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine. in which the natural FAD has been substituted with 2′-F arabino FAD (2′-F FAD). PHBH is an extensively studied aromatic hydroxylase that catalyzes the conversion of p-hydroxybenzoate (pOHB) to 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-diOHB) using molecular oxygen and NADPH (9Entsch B. van Berkel W.J.H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle may be conveniently divided into 2 halves (Fig. 1). In the reductive half-reaction, the oxidized enzyme-bound flavin is reduced by NADPH. When pOHB or certain analogs are bound to the enzyme, flavin reduction is accelerated by many orders of magnitude (10Hussain M. Massey V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6657-6666PubMed Google Scholar). After hydride transfer, NADP dissociates and molecular oxygen reacts with the reduced enzyme in the first step of the oxidative half-reaction. The reaction of molecular oxygen with the reduced enzyme produces the flavin C4ahydroperoxide, a very reactive intermediate. This very electrophilic species transfers its distal oxygen atom to the aromatic substrate in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The immediate (enzyme-bound) products of the reaction are the flavin C4a-hydroxide and a non-aromatic tautomer of the ultimate phenolic product. In subsequent steps, the product tautomerizes to its more stable aromatic form and the hydroxyflavin eliminates water to form the oxidized flavin. For pOHB, the non-aromatic hydroxylation product and its tautomerization reaction are not observed, presumably for kinetic reasons, but the analogous intermediate has been observed with some unnatural substrates such as 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (2,4-diOHB). The intermediate is characterized by a high UV-visible absorbance because of the conjugated product chromophore and the absorbance of the flavin hydroxide (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schopfer L.M. Wessiak A. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13080-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The non-aromatic product tautomer is also observed in phenol hydroxylase, a mechanistically related enzyme, and its properties have been characterized (13Maeda-Yorita K. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 266: 4134-4144Google Scholar). Structures of several PHBH-ligand complexes have been determined by x-ray diffraction (14Schreuder H.A. Prick P.A.J. Wierenga R.K. Vriend G. Wilson K.S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10161-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that the isoalloxazine moiety can adopt two conformations (Fig. 2), termed “in” and “out” (16Gatti D.L. Palfey B.A. Lah M.S. Entsch B. Massey V. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Schreuder H.A. Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. van der Bolt F.J.T. van Berkel W.J.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10161-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The isoalloxazine moiety of structures that have the in conformation is largely shielded from solvent and lies close to the aromatic ligand in a position ideal for substrate hydroxylation. In contrast, when the isoalloxazine moves to the out conformation, it is much more exposed to solvent and is too far from the substrate for the oxygen transfer reaction. The out conformation has been observed under a number of conditions, for instance, in site-directed mutants or with aromatic ligands bearing a 2-substituent. The most significant difference between the in and out conformations is a ∼30 °C rotation around the C1′-C2′ bond of the ribityl chain. Thus it might be expected that alterations at C2′ might also cause a change in the flavin conformation of PHBH. This has been demonstrated for wild-type PHBH substituted with arabino FAD when pOHB is bound (5Van Berkel W.J.H. Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In that case, the flavin was found in the out conformation by crystallographic analysis. That study also reported some catalytic properties of the substituted enzyme implying that the chemistry of several steps was altered by the change in the flavin. Perhaps the most intriguing finding was that the rate constant for the reduction of the unnatural flavin was significantly higher than in the natural enzyme. Using site-directed mutants, pH, and kinetic isotope effects, it has recently been shown that the flavin of PHBH moves to the out position prior to reduction (18Palfey B.A. Moran G.R. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The results of the studies reported here characterize in detail the changes brought about by altering the 2′-position of FAD and indicate that several steps of the catalytic cycle depend on the conformational balance afforded by the natural 2′-ribityl substituent. Therefore, the 2′-hydroxyl of FAD can be an important participant in catalysis by flavoenzymes indirectly by acting as a regulator of conformational changes. PHBH was overexpressed in Escherichia coli containing the plasmid pNE130 (19Moran G.R. Entsch B. Protein Exp. Purif. 1995; 6: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (20Palfey B.A. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The natural FAD of the enzyme was replaced with 2′-F FAD by the Red-A method (16Gatti D.L. Palfey B.A. Lah M.S. Entsch B. Massey V. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). 2′-F FAD was synthesized as reported (6Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28586-28594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Absorbance spectra were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard 8452a diode array spectrophotometer, a Cary 3 spectrophotometer, or a Shimadzu UV-2501PC spectrophotometer. Reduction potentials were determined in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 25 °C using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase method (21Massey Curti B. Ronchi S. Zannetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1990. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1990: 59-66Google Scholar). Rapid reactions were studied using a Hi-Tech SF-61 according to methods described previously (22Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For studies of the oxidation of the enzyme-pOHB complex, single wavelength absorbance traces were collected from 350 to 500 nm, combined into a single data file, and fit using the program Specfit (Spectrum Software Associates). Single wavelength traces obtained for the reduction reaction were analyzed using Marquardt exponential fitting routines implemented in Program A developed in the laboratory of Professor D. P. Ballou, University of Michigan. Spectral Properties—The flavin absorbance spectrum of native PHBH is only slightly perturbed compared with that of free FAD. In that system, the enzyme has a slightly lower extinction coefficient (10.3 mm–1 cm–1) compared with that of free FAD (11.3 mm–1 cm–1) at 450 nm, but the absorbance peak positions are essentially unchanged (450 and 374 nm). In contrast, a significant shift in the absorbance maxima were observed when the 2′-F FAD of the substituted enzyme was liberated upon denaturation with SDS. When bound to PHBH, the artificial chromophore has maxima at 456 nm (10.5 mm–1 cm–1) and 368 nm (7.98 mm–1 cm–1), whereas the free 2′-F FAD has maxima at 448 nm (10.5 mm–1 cm–1) and 376 nm (8.18 mm–1 cm–1). The flavin fluorescence intensity of native PHBH is essentially the same as that of free FAD, and is quenched to ∼40% upon binding of pOHB. The fluorescence of the 2′-F FAD-substituted enzyme in the absence of ligands was found to be 5.4 times lower, and the binding of pOHB caused a ∼2-fold quenching of fluorescence. Ligand Binding—The binding at 4 °C, pH 6.5, of ligands to the enzyme substituted with 2′-F FAD caused changes in the visible absorbance spectra (Fig. 3), which enabled the determination of dissociation constants (Table I). The natural substrate of the enzyme, pOHB, bound to the enzyme some 5-fold less tightly than it did to natural PHBH. An alternate substrate, 2,4-diOHB, was also studied. This ligand bound to the 2′-F FAD-substituted enzyme more tightly than to the natural enzyme by about a factor of 4.Table IComparison of properties of natural and 2′-F FAD-substituted PHBHNatural PHBHaValues for the natural enzyme are from Ref. 22.2′-F FAD PHBHλmax (nm)/ϵ (mm-1 cm-1)450/10.3456/10.5Kd(pOHB) (μm)9.549Kd(2,4-diOHB) (μm)215.5Kd(NADPH) (μm)210160Em7 (free) (mV)-163-113Em7 (+pOHB) (mV)-165-119a Values for the natural enzyme are from Ref. 22Entsch B.

Open table in a new tab The isoalloxazine moiety of PHBH is conformationally mobile and its position can be influenced by the identity of the aromatic ligand. The position of the flavin in a particular enzyme-ligand complex correlates with the flavin difference spectrum observed in solution caused by ligand binding (16Gatti D.L. Palfey B.A. Lah M.S. Entsch B. Massey V. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Schreuder H.A. Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. van der Bolt F.J.T. van Berkel W.J.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10161-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When 2,4-diOHB binds to the natural enzyme, a difference spectrum with large increases in absorbance at ∼480 and ∼390 nm is observed. A very similar change in the absorbance spectrum was observed when 2,4-diOHB bound to the 2′-F FAD-substituted enzyme. Thus it can be concluded that when 2,4-diOHB is bound to the substituted enzyme, the artificial flavin probably adopts the out conformation. In contrast, the pOHB complex of natural PHBH is characterized by relatively small decreases throughout most of the region in which the flavin absorbs. However, the 2′-F FAD-substituted enzyme does not exhibit this difference spectrum that is characteristic of the in conformation, nor does it exhibit a difference spectrum similar to that of the 2,4-diOHB complex. Instead, a difference spectrum characterized by a decrease in absorbance in the 490-nm region and an increase centered around 430 nm. Of the structurally characterized PHBH complexes, this spectral change most closely resembles that of the arabino FAD-substituted enzyme with pOHB bound at the active site (5Van Berkel W.J.H. Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this complex shows that the flavin is in the out conformation, so that we conclude that the isoalloxazine is also out in the 2′-F FAD-substituted PHBH. pKa of Bound pOHB—Wild-type PHBH lowers the phenolic pKa of pOHB from its value of 9.3 in solution to a value of 7.4 (22Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pKa of pOHB bound to 2-F′ FAD-substituted PHBH was determined at 25 °C by titrating the artificial enzyme (10.5 μm) with pOHB; buffers ranged in pH from 6.0 to 8.5 (22Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance of the phenolate extends to 300 nm, where it was observed with little interference from other chromophores. The variation of the saturating absorbance at 300 nm with pH allowed a pKa value of 6.7 to be calculated (Fig. 4). This value is 0.7 units lower than the value of the pKa in the natural enzyme, demonstrating that flavin position is linked to the ionization state of the ligand as proposed previously (18Palfey B.A. Moran G.R. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation Stoichiometry—The flavin C4a-hydroperoxide intermediate (Fig. 1) can either hydroxylate the aromatic substrate or eliminate H2O2. Natural PHBH efficiently hydroxylates pOHB so that H2O2 production is barely detected. A variety of factors can influence the relative rates of these two competing reactions, thus influencing the hydroxylation stoichiometry. We found that PHBH substituted with 2′-F FAD-hydroxylated pOHB with slightly lower efficiency than the natural system. In assay mixtures in which pOHB was the limiting reagent, the ratio of pOHB consumed to NADPH consumed (as measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm) allowed the calculation of the hydroxylation stoichiometry. At pH 6.5, 25 °C, a value of 90% was found. At pH 8.0, 25 °C, pOHB hydroxylation was less effective, with 77% of the NADPH consumed resulting in the hydroxylated product. The natural enzyme hydroxylates 92% effectively under these conditions (23Palfey B.A. Basu R. Frederick K.K. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8438-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The lower hydroxylation efficiency of the artificial enzyme at higher pH indicates that the elimination of H2O2 from the flavin hydroperoxide is faster, which we attribute to the base-catalyzed deprotonation of the flavin N5. Reactions of Reduced Enzyme with O2 and Hydroxylation of pOHB—Free reduced native PHBH reacts with O2 to form oxidized enzyme and H2O2 with a bimolecular rate constant of 2.6 × 104m–1 s–1 at pH 6.5, 4 °C. No intermediates are detectable when the ligand-free enzyme reacts (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it has been proposed that a flavin semiquinone-superoxide pair and a flavin hydroperoxide are intermediates (24Bruice T.C. Isr. J. Chem. 1984; 24: 54-61Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that are unobservable because of kinetic reasons. Free reduced 2′-F FAD-substituted PHBH is also oxidized by O2 without the formation of observable intermediates. However, the reaction is nearly an order of magnitude slower, with a rate constant of 3.4 × 103m–1 s–1. The oxidative half-reaction of PHBH in complex with a number of substrates has been extensively studied by stopped-flow methods. When the reduced enzyme-substrate complex is mixed with oxygen-containing buffer at 4 °C, pH 6.5, absorbance changes between 300 and 500 nm allow the observation of reaction intermediates and the determination of their absorbance spectra. We studied the reaction of the reduced 2′-F FAD-substituted PHBH-pOHB complex in the absence and presence of the inhibitor azide. The reactions of the oxidative sequence were slower than those of native PHBH. In the absence of azide, three reaction phases were observed. The first phase, readily observed as an absorbance increase between 340 and 420 nm, was the second-order reaction between reduced enzyme and O2 to form the flavin hydroperoxide. The linear variation with O2 concentration of the pseudo first-order rate constant for hydroperoxide formation, determined at 380 nm, gave a value of 1.2 × 105m–1 s–1 for the second-order rate constant. In native PHBH, a value of 2.8 × 105m–1 s–1 has been reported (25Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this bimolecular rate constant is nearly 2 orders of magnitude larger than the rate constant for the reaction of O2 in the absence of substrate, so that pOHB binding to the artificial enzyme stimulates the reaction from an abnormally low rate to a normal rate. Substrate hydroxylation and H2O2 elimination by the flavin hydroperoxide was followed with an observed rate constant of 16.8 s–1. The hydroxylation stoichiometry measurements (described above) of 90% product formation is a measure of the partitioning of the flavin hydroperoxide between the hydroxylation and elimination pathways. With that information, values of 15.1 s–1 for the hydroxylation rate constant and 1.7 s–1 for the elimination reaction were calculated. In the native system, the substrate is hydroxylated with a rate constant of 47 s–1 and there is no detectable H2O2 formation (25Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although an upper limit of 0.9 s–1 has been estimated (22Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the modification of the ribityl chain has both slowed the hydroxylation reaction and accelerated the elimination of H2O2. The flavin hydroxide formed by the hydroxylation of pOHB eliminated water to form oxidized flavin with a rate constant of 2.1 s–1. In native pOHB, this reaction occurs with a rate constant of 14 s–1, faster by more than a factor of 6. By collecting data at wavelengths from 330 to 500 nm, it was possible to calculate the absorbance spectra of the intermediates (Fig. 5). The flavin hydroperoxide of the 2′-F FAD-substituted enzyme had a slightly blue-shifted absorbance spectrum with a maximum at 385 nm, compared with 390 nm for native PHBH (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the flavin hydroxide was blue-shifted compared with the hydroperoxide, with an absorbance maximum at 380 nm, the same as the maximum in native PHBH. Monovalent anions are inhibitory in many of the reactions in the PHBH catalytic cycle, allowing high concentrations of azide to be used to kinetically resolve the reactions of the oxidative half-reaction (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.1 m azide, the reaction with molecular oxygen is virtually unaffected, as is the case with native PHBH; a rate constant of 1.1 × 105m–1 s–1 was determined. The hydroxylation of pOHB was slowed more than 10-fold and had a rate constant of 1.4 s–1, an inhibitory effect that is somewhat greater than with the native enzyme. The elimination of water from the hydroxyflavin was also slowed by 0.1 m azide, but only by a factor of ∼3 to a value of 0.61 s–1, in contrast to the 10-fold decrease with the native enzyme. Thus rather than kinetically resolving the conversion of the flavin hydroperoxide to the flavin hydroxide, 0.1 m azide had the opposite effect. It seems likely that this difference is because of changes in the affinity of azide for the various enzyme forms caused by interactions with the altered ribityl chain. Hydroxylation of 2,4-diOHB—PHBH hydroxylates other substrates, although not as efficiently as the natural substrate pOHB. The most extensively studied alternate substrate is 2,4-diOHB (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wessiak A. Schopfer L.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12547-12556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional intermediate with a high extinction coefficient, called “intermediate II,” forms upon transferring the distal oxygen atom of the flavin hydroperoxide to the substrate. The high absorbance of the intermediate is thought to be the summation of the absorbance of the flavin hydroxide formed in the reaction and the absorbance of the initial non-aromatic hydroxylation product (12Schopfer L.M. Wessiak A. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13080-13085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent tautomerization to the aromatic product causes the loss of this chromophore leaving only the absorbance of the flavin hydroxide in the 300–500 nm region. The high extinction intermediate is not observed in pOHB hydroxylation, probably for kinetic reasons. The same sequence of reactions in the hydroxylation of 2,4-diOHB that occur in native PHBH were also observed in stopped-flow experiments at pH 6.5, 4 °C, with the 2′-F FAD-substituted enzyme. The bimolecular reaction between the reduced enzyme-2,4-diOHB complex with O2 had a rate constant of 3.32 × 105m–1 s–1 and formed a flavin C4a-hydroperoxide, similar to the native system. The substrate was hydroxylated less effectively by the artificial enzyme, with a rate constant of 2.7 s–1 observed for the consumption of the flavin hydroperoxide. The elimination of H2O2 from the flavin hydroperoxide was clearly observed at long wavelengths such as 480 nm where only the oxidized enzyme produced by the elimination reaction absorbs significantly. This reaction phase accounted for 64% of the total oxidized enzyme that was ultimately produced, allowing rate constants of 1.0 s–1 and 1.7 s–1 to be calculated for the hydroxylation and elimination reactions, respectively. Native PHBH hydroxylates 2,4-diOHB with a rate constant of 16 s–1 and H2O2 eliminates with a rate constant of 5 s–1, forming only 24% oxidized enzyme in this reaction phase (11Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2550-2563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alteration of the ribityl chain has slowed both reactions of the hydroperoxide, with the hydroxylation reaction being more severely inhibited. After correcting for the large amount of oxidized enzyme present, a spectrum of intermediate II was calculated that had an absorbance maximum near 390 nm, similar to the native enzyme. Intermediate II decayed with a rate constant of 0.45 s–1, only marginally slower than in the native enzyme (0.625 s–1). The observed rate constant of this reaction in the natural enzyme is sensitive to the concentration of 2,4-diOHB, presumably because of secondary binding of 2,4-diOHB, 2B. A. Palfey, unpublished results. It is conceivable that small changes in ligand affinity at this second binding site could be responsible for the kinetic difference. The last reaction of the oxidative sequence, the elimination of water from the flavin C4a-hydroxide, had a rate constant of 0.016 s–1, about 10-fold slower than the reaction in the native system. Azide (0.1 m) had an inhibitory effect on the 2,4-diOHB oxidation sequence, as it did with pOHB as substrate (Table II).Table IIRate constants determined by stopped-flow experiments for 2′-F FAD PHBH Rate constants are defined in Fig. 1.Rate constantAromatic substratepOHBpOHB + 0.1 M NaN32,4-diOHB2,4-diOHB + 0.1 M NaN3k1 (s-1)187NDaND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab Flavin Reduction—The flavin of native PHBH is reduced by NADPH with a rate constant of 50 s–1 at 4 °C, pH 6.5, when pOHB is bound to the enzyme. This reaction is accompanied by charge transfer absorbance of the isoalloxazine-pyridine nucleotide pair that are thought to indicate that the reactants are aligned optimally (22Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of FAD with 2′-F FAD resulted in an enhancement of the reduction reaction. In stopped-flow experiments at 4 °C, pH 6.5, the anaerobic oxidized artificial enzyme-pOHB complex was mixed with anaerobic solutions containing pOHB and various concentrations of NADPH. The oxidized flavin absorbance at 450 nm was bleached after a slight lag in a reaction whose observed rate constant approached a value of 187 s–1 at saturating NADPH concentrations, more than 3-fold faster than the value observed in the native system (Fig. 6). A dissociation constant of 160 μm was determined from the half-saturating concentration of NADPH, a value that is slightly lower than that for native PHBH (210 μm). When reactions were observed at 720 nm, charge-transfer absorbance was clearly evident (Fig. 6, inset). The increase in absorbance at 720 nm corresponded to the hydride transfer reaction and was fit with an observed rate constant matching that obtained at 450 nm. The decrease at 720 nm was satisfactorily fit for all NADPH concentrations with a value in the range of 140 to 200 s–1 that was insensitive to NADPH concentration, leading us to ascribe this phase to NADP+ dissociation, which is 20 s–1 in the natural enzyme. The two-electron reduction potentials of the free 2′-F FAD-substituted PHBH and the pOHB complex were measured at pH 7.0, 25 °C, using the xanthine oxidase reduction method with indigo disulfonate (Em7 = –116 mV) as an indicator dye. The modification of the ribityl chain of the flavin caused large increases in redox potentials, to –113 mV for the free enzyme and –119 mV for the enzyme-pOHB complex, compared with the corresponding values of –163 and –165 mV for the natural enzyme (22Entsch B. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17341-17349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the alteration of the ribityl chain enhanced the reductive half-reaction in a number of ways: reduction was more favorable thermodynamically, the kinetic barrier to hydride transfer was lower, and the strength of NADPH binding was increased. The isoalloxazine moiety of FAD or FMN has traditionally been thought to be the only catalytically important portion of the prosthetic group. However, several enzymes have been identified (3Miller S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in which the 2′-hydroxyl of the ribityl chain appears to play an important role augmenting the redox chemistry. PHBH clearly belongs to this group of enzymes. In PHBH, the alteration at the 2′-ribityl position changes the conformation of the flavin. Inspection of the structure of natural PHBH with pOHB bound (Protein Data Bank code 1pbe (4Ghisla S. Engst S. Vock P. Kieweg V. Bross P. Nandy A. Rasched I. Strauss A.W. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1993. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1994: 283-292Crossref Google Scholar)) shows that inverting the configuration of the 2′-ribityl carbon would place a substituent in van der Waals contact with the side chain of Gln-102. The crystal structure of the arabino FAD-substituted PHBH (5Van Berkel W.J.H. Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) shows that the 2′-OH of that flavin moves to a position that instead enables it to form a hydrogen bond with Gln-102. This altered binding mode of the ribityl chain is responsible for causing the arabino FAD to move to the out conformation; analogous forces would also favor the out conformation of 2′-F FAD, and this appears to be responsible for many of the effects on catalysis. As described below, the position of the flavin influences the ionization state of bound pOHB, the reactivity of NADPH, the strength of ligand binding, and steps in the oxidative half-reaction. Flavin movement is linked to the ionization state of the phenolic oxygen of pOHB through interactions between the flavin, the side chain of Asn-300, the peptide backbone to the carbonyl of Pro-293, and the phenolic oxygen of pOHB (18Palfey B.A. Moran G.R. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Palfey B.A. Basu R. Frederick K.K. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8438-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Frederick K.K. Ballou D.P. Palfey B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3891-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutating Pro-293 to the more flexible Ser removes this linkage, allowing the carbonyl oxygen of residue 293 to move freely away from the phenolate of pOHB without driving the conformational change. Relieving the dipole-charge repulsion in the P293S mutant lowers the phenolic pKa by 0.7 units. In this work, we have shown that substituting FAD in the wild-type enzyme with 2′-F FAD also lowers the phenolic pKa of pOHB by 0.7 units. However, instead of breaking the linkage between the flavin position and the protonation state of pOHB, inverting the stereocenter forces the isoalloxazine to the out position. With the linkage between conformation and ionization state (described above) retained, the out conformation lowers the phenolic pKa of pOHB. This state of the enzyme-pOHB complex, with pOHB ionized to the phenolate and the flavin in the out conformation, is thought to represent the form that is reactive toward NADPH. In agreement with this, the 2′-F FAD-substituted enzyme reacted almost 4-fold faster than the natural enzyme, and the binding of NADPH was tighter. A similar result has been reported for arabino FAD-substituted PHBH (5Van Berkel W.J.H. Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These effects are because of the preorganization of the enzyme in the reactive conformation, so that the energy derived from NADPH binding no longer drives the flavin conformational change. Moving the flavin from the in to the out conformation might increase the thermodynamic driving force in the reaction with NADPH while the enzyme is properly configured for reduction, as evidenced by the ∼50 mV increase in the flavin potential of the artificial enzyme compared with the natural system. This difference cannot be explained simply by inherent chemical differences between the flavins because the redox potentials of the two free flavins are essentially identical (–207 mV for FAD and –206 mV for 2′-F FAD (3Miller S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13066-13073Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)). However, it is also possible that the high redox potential is the result of improved protein-flavin interactions once the artificial flavin is reduced. These possibilities cannot be differentiated at present. The substitution of 2′-F FAD for FAD alters some of the reactions on the pathway from reduced to oxidized enzyme. In the absence of an aromatic substrate, the reduced artificial enzyme reacts with O2 an order of magnitude more slowly than the natural enzyme. Because it is thought that the rate-determining step in the oxidation process is the formation of the semiquinone-superoxide pair, the lower reaction rate indicates that this intermediate is less stable because of the alteration to the ribityl chain. Two possibilities should be considered for the origin of this instability: either the inverted stereocenter causes the flavin to adopt a less reactive conformation, or specific stabilizing interactions to the 2′-hydroxyl of the ribityl chain are absent. In the former case, it is expected that the reduced flavin in the out conformation will be less reactive than the in conformation because the environment of the flavin in the out conformation more closely resembles aqueous solution, where flavins react comparatively slowly with O2 (28Massey V. Palmer G. Ballou D.P. King T.E. Mason H.S. Morrison M. Oxidases and Related Redox Systems. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1973: 25-49Google Scholar, 29Kemal C. Chan T.W. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 7272-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Eberlein G. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6685-6697Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Apparently, the active site of the enzyme stabilizes the requisite semiquinone-superoxide intermediate and the rate-determining transition state forming this intermediate, and this stabilizing influence would be unavailable in the out conformation. The change in environment might be expected to lower the potential of the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple. Unfortunately, the semiquinone of PHBH is too unstable to be observed under normal circumstances, so changes to its stability cannot be discerned. Alternatively, it might be imagined that the 2′-hydroxyl of the flavin normally has a direct role in stabilizing the intermediate, perhaps by forming a hydrogen bond to superoxide. However, the structures of the natural PHBH-pOHB complex (Protein Data Bank code 1pbe) and the arabino FAD-substituted PHBH-pOHB complex (which has the same stereo-chemistry as 2′-F FAD) show that the 2′-substituents are too far from the si-face of the isoalloxazine, the presumed site of O2 reaction, to directly interact with nascent superoxide. Therefore we conclude that the change to the rate of reaction of the free reduced artificial enzyme with O2 is the result of flavin conformational effects. Interestingly, normal rates were observed for the reaction of O2 with either the pOHB complex or the 2,4-diOHB complex suggesting that in the presence of these substrates, when the artificial flavin is reduced, the flavin adopts the in conformation. The flavin hydroperoxide, presumably formed in the in conformation, is less reactive in the artificial enzyme than in the natural enzyme when either pOHB or 2,4-diOHB are used as substrate. Because the isoalloxazine moiety is unaltered in the artificial enzyme, the lower hydroxylation rates cannot be because of changes in the inherent reactivity of the intermediate. Instead, the inversion and substitution at the 2′-ribityl carbon must alter reactivity in a more subtle manner. The propensity of the 2′-F FAD to adopt alternate conformations on PHBH could cause the flavin hydroperoxide to adopt a less-than-optimal position to hydroxylate the substrate. Moving the distal oxygen of the flavin hydroperoxide by only a tenth of an Ångstrom is likely to cause significant changes to the reaction rate. Alternatively, a water molecule bound to the re-face of the flavin in the oxidized wild-type enzyme has been invoked as an active site acid (31Schreuder H.A. Hol W.G.J. Drenth J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), protonating the proximal oxygen during hydroxylation. Small changes in the position of the isoalloxazine could cause chemically important changes in the position or orientation of this putative acid, slowing the hydroxylation reaction. Following substrate hydroxylation, the non-aromatic product tautomerizes. When 2,4-diOHB is the substrate, this reaction is slow enough to observe. The rate of this reaction was not very different between the artificial and natural enzymes, consistent with the notion that it is a tautomerization reaction. Our results show that the position of the flavin in PHBH has important effects in catalysis. Interestingly, significant rate increases are possible in the reductive half-reaction, as evidenced by the changes caused by substituting 2′-F FAD or arabino FAD (5Van Berkel W.J.H. Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for natural FAD. Presumably, it should be possible to alter the protein to cause similar changes. However, improving the reductive half-reaction of PHBH has only been achieved at the expense of the efficiency of the oxidative half-reaction. Factors that improve the reductive half-reaction will increase the likelihood that the flavin will be in the out conformation, whereas the oxidative reactions require the in conformation to generate the flavin hydroperoxide and shield it from solvent so that it can hydroxylate the substrate. Therefore, the control of the flavin position in PHBH represents a compromise between the conflicting needs of two chemically disparate half-reactions that have been optimized by evolution to maximize the overall hydroxylation of pOHB."
