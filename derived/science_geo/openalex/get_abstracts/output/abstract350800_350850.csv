Here we report cIAP1 to be selectively down-regulated by a class of small molecules ((-)-N-[(2S,3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyryl]-l-leucine methyl ester (ME-BS)), resulting in a sensitization of cancer cells to apoptosis. ME-BS directly interacts with the BIR3 domain of cIAP1, promotes auto-ubiquitylation dependent on its RING domain, and facilitates proteasomal degradation of cIAP1. Other IAPs such as XIAP and cIAP2 were not affected by ME-BS. These results suggest targeted destabilization of cIAP1 by small molecules as a novel method to treat cancers expressing cIAP1, which interferes with treatment. Manipulation of the intrinsic ubiquitin-ligase activity could be a novel strategy to develop small molecules for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2088140581,"The prompt clearance of cells undergoing apoptosis is critical during embryonic development and normal tissue turnover, as well as during inflammation and autoimmune responses. We recently demonstrated that stabilin-2 is a phosphatidylserine receptor that mediates the clearance of apoptotic cells, thereby releasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-β. However, the downstream signaling components of stabilin-2-mediated phagocytosis are not known. Here, we provide evidence that the adaptor protein, GULP, physically and functionally interacts with the stabilin-2 cytoplasmic tail. Using fluorescent resonance energy transfer analysis and biochemical approaches, we show that GULP directly binds to the cytoplasmic tail of stabilin-2. Knockdown of endogenous GULP expression significantly decreased stabilin-2-mediated phagocytosis. Conversely, overexpression of GULP caused an increase in aged cell engulfment. The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of GULP was sufficient for the interaction with stabilin-2; therefore, transduction of TAT fusion PTB domain acts as a dominant negative, resulting in impaired engulfment of aged red blood cells in stabilin-2 expressing cells. In addition, the PTB domain of GULP was able to specifically interact with the NPXY motif of the stabilin-2 cytoplasmic tail. Taken together, these results indicate that GULP is a likely downstream molecule in the stabilin-2-mediated signaling pathway and plays an important role in stabilin-2-mediated phagocytosis.

The quick clearance of apoptotic cells occurs throughout the life span of all multicellular organisms and is critical for the prevention of serious consequences as a result of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (1Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Genetic studies conducted in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified seven genes that act in two partially redundant pathways to control the clearance of apoptotic cells. In one pathway, CED-2/CrkII, CED-5/Dock180, and CED-12/ELMO1 act together to regulate CED-10, which in turn promotes cytoskeletal reorganization during corpse engulfment (2Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R.

In the other pathway, CED-1/MEGF10, CED-7/ABCA1, and CED-6/GULP act together (4Wu Y.C. Horvitz H.R.

Cell. 1998; 93: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Both pathways converge at CED-10 to mediate actin rearrangement and subsequent engulfment of cell corpses (8Kinchen J.M. Cabello J. Klingele D. Wong K. Feichtinger R. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2005; 434: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).GULP, which is the mammalian orthologue of CED-6, functions as a cytoplasmic adaptor protein in the engulfment of apoptotic corpses (7Liu Q.A.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1351-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GULP is composed of a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) 2The abbreviations used are: PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; PS, phosphatidylserine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FRET, fluorescent resonance energy transfer; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RBC, red blood cell; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; RT, reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; PS, phosphatidylserine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FRET, fluorescent resonance energy transfer; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ANOVA, analysis of variance; RBC, red blood cell; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; RT, reverse transcription. domain at its N terminus, a central leucine zipper, and a C-terminal serine/proline-rich region. Previously, it was observed that the engulfment defect in ced-6-deficient worms was rescued by the expression of human CED-6/GULP as a transgene, which showed the conservation of the function of CED-6 through evolution (10Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1347-1350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that the signaling pathways mediated by CED-6/GULP are likely conserved from worms to humans. Additionally, GULP has been shown to directly interact with CED-1 and its human homologues (LRP1 and MEGF10) and is known to be involved in the engulfment of apoptotic cells (5Su H.P. Nakada-Tsukui K. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Li Y. Bu G. Henson P.M. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11772-11779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki E. Nakayama M. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3729-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, draper, the Drosophila orthologue of CED-1, and Dced-6 mediate the removal of apoptotic cells both in vivo and in the Drosophila central nervous system (12Awasaki T. Tatsumi R. Takahashi K. Arai K. Nakanishi Y. Ueda R. Ito K. Neuron. 2006; 50: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Stabilin-2/FEEL-2/HARE is a large multifunctional glycoprotein that is reportedly a hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis (13Zhou B.

Adachi H. Osuga J. Ohashi K. Yahagi N. Sekiya M. Okazaki H. Tomita S. Iizuka Y. Shimano H. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tsujimoto M. Ishibashi S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34264-34270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated for the first time that stabilin-2 also functions as a membrane receptor involved in the engulfment of apoptotic cells (18Park S.Y. Jung M.Y. Kim H.J. Lee S.J. Kim S.Y. Lee B.H. Kwon T.H. Park R.W. Kim I.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously showed that stabilin-2 can stereospecifically recognize PS, and that activation of stabilin-2 by anti-stabilin-2 antibody led to a release of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-β, in macrophages, which suggests that stabilin-2 is a bona fide PS receptor for cell corpse clearance in macrophages. This finding prompted us to investigate the intracellular signaling pathway that is mediated by stabilin-2. Stabilin-2 contains a large extracellular portion that encodes for seven FAS1 domains, four epidermal growth factor-like domain repeats, a Link domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic region. The cytoplasmic domain of stabilin-2 has NPXY and YXXL motifs (potential binding sites for both PTB and Src homology 2 domains, respectively) that are known to be critical for CED-1-mediated phagocytosis (6Zhou Z. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and GULP/CED-6 has the PTB domain, which is known to interact with the NPXY motif. Therefore, we evaluated GULP to determine whether it interacts with the NPXY motif of stabilin-2 and transduces the signal for the stabilin-2-mediated engulfment of apoptotic cells.In this study, we demonstrate that the PTB domain of the GULP protein directly binds to the NPXY motif of the cytoplasmic tail of stabilin-2, and we provide the first evidence for a requisite function of GULP in stabilin-2-mediated phagocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—L cells that were stably transfected with stabilin-2-Myc (L/Stab-2 cells) or an empty vector (L/Mock cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) that was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and appropriate antibiotics, as described previously (18Park S.Y. Jung M.Y. Kim H.J. Lee S.J. Kim S.Y. Lee B.H. Kwon T.H. Park R.W. Kim I.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were maintained in F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the appropriate antibiotics. COS7 and PT67 cells were maintained in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the appropriate antibiotics.Antibodies—Monoclonal antibody directed against c-Myc (clone 9E10) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibody directed against FLAG (clone M2) was obtained from Sigma. To produce human and mouse GULP antibodies, His-tagged recombinant human and mouse GULP proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using a Ni-NTA column, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Antibodies were raised in rabbits by subcutaneous injection of the recombinant protein (200 μg). The antiserum was further purified via affinity chromatography in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Biosciences).Plasmids—The cDNAs encoding the full-length GULP (amino acids 1–304), PTB domain (amino acids 11–159), and C-terminal region (leucine zipper and proline-rich domain, amino acids 159–304) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (for expression as GST fusion proteins) and p3XFLAGCMV (for expression as FLAG-tagged proteins). Plasmid encoding mCherry was a generous gift from Takeharu Nagai (Hokkaido University). The cDNA encoding the full-length stabilin-2 was cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His (18Park S.Y. Jung M.Y. Kim H.J. Lee S.J. Kim S.Y. Lee B.H. Kwon T.H. Park R.W. Kim I.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding stabilin-2 mutants (NPXA, APXY, and APXA) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The cDNA corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of stabilin-2 (amino acids 2461–2551) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pET28a (Novagen). For generation of bacterial constructs expressing the stabilin-2 cytoplasmic tail with mutations in the NPXY motif (NPXA, APXY, and APXA), the regions corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of each individual stabilin-2 mutant from the mammalian expression vectors mentioned above were amplified by PCR and were then subcloned into pET28a.Protein Expression and Purification—GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL-21 cells and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. The His-tagged stabilin-2 cytoplasmic tail and the mutants were expressed in BL-21 cells and then purified using a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) as described previously (19Kim J.E. Kim S.J. Lee B.H. Park R.W. Kim K.S. Kim I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30907-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).In Vitro Binding Experiments—Bacterially produced Histagged proteins corresponding to the stabilin-2 cytoplasmic tail (wild type or NPXY mutants) were incubated with GST fusion GULP protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in a binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1–2 h at 4 °C with rocking. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed five times with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. Next, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The bound His-tagged stabilin-2 protein was then resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-His antibody. GST fusion proteins used in the experiments were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.FRET Analysis—For FRET imaging experiments in living cells, COS7 cells were cultured on a collagen-coated 35-mm glass-base dish (Asahi Techno Glass, Tokyo, Japan) and then transfected with pcDNA-stabilin-2-eGFP and pcDNA-mCherry-GULP using Lipofectamine, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal FRET images were obtained using a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Cascade 512B (EMCCD) camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ), a CSU-10 spinning Nipkow disk confocal unit (Yokogawa Electric, Tokyo, Japan), an emission filter wheel (MAC5000, Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY), and a krypton/argon laser. All systems were controlled using the MetaMorph software program (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Fluorescent images were acquired sequentially through eGFP, mCherry, and FRET filter channels. Filter sets used were purchased from Chroma Technology (Rockingham, VT). Images were acquired by using the 2 × 2 binning mode and 200-ms exposure time. FRET analysis was carried out as described previously (20Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Corrected FRET (FRETC) was calculated by using the following equation: FRETC = FRET - (0.16 × eGFP) - (0.2 × mCherry). FRETC images were displayed in the pseudocolor mode.Retroviral Infection—Human GULP cDNA was amplified by PCR, cloned at the XhoI-EcoRI site of the pMSCVpuro retroviral vector, and then designated as pMSCV-GULP. To generate recombinant retrovirus for the purpose of infecting L/Mock and L/Stab-2 cells, PT67 packaging cells (Clontech) were transfected with pMSCV-GULP or an empty vector using Metafectine (Biontex). 48 h after transfection, the cells were replated and grown in maintenance medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 2 weeks. Retrovirus-containing medium was then filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter, supplemented with 6 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma), and used to infect pre-confluent L/Mock or L/Stab-2 cells. Stable cell lines were selected further using 7 μg/ml puromycin.Preparation of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNAs representing GULP cDNA nucleotides 532–1364 and green fluorescence protein (GFP) cDNA nucleotides 128–1045 were generated in vitro by using a Dicer siRNA Generation kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Gene Therapy Systems). Briefly, PCR products with T7 promoter sequences were transcribed in vitro, and the resulting double-stranded RNA was digested with recombinant Dicer enzyme to convert it to siRNA. L/Stab-2 cells were then transfected with GULP siRNA or GFP siRNA using GeneSilencer reagent (Gene Therapy Systems). After 48 h, the cells were subjected to the phagocytosis assays. GFP siRNA was used as a control for GULP siRNA, and disruption of GULP expression was estimated by comparing the ratio of GULP and β-actin band intensities between control and GULP siRNA transfections via RT-PCR and Western blotting.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and the quantity and quality of the isolated RNA were then determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. The reverse transcription reaction was performed in a mixture with a final volume of 30 μl that contained 2 μg of total RNA, 200 ng of oligo(dT)15 primer, 1× reverse transcription buffer, 0.5 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture, RNasin recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). After incubation for 50 min at 42 °C, the reverse transcription reaction was terminated by heating it for 15 min at 70 °C. The newly synthesized cDNA was then amplified by PCR in a reaction mixture consisting of 2 μl of cDNA template, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, and 0.3 μm of mouse GULP primers (sense 5′-GGA ACA GAA GTT GTG AGA GAT G-3′; antisense 5′-CTG ATC CAC AGT TAA ATG GGT C-3′). Mouse β-actin primers (sense 5′-TCA CCC ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT ACG A-3′; antisense 5′-GGA TGC CAC AGG ATT CCA TAC CCA-3′) were used as an internal control. The amplification was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min (initial denaturation); 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s (30 cycles); and 72 °C for 7 min (final extension). PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and then visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Immunoprecipitations and GST Pulldown Assays—CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged stabilin-2 (wild type or mutants) and FLAG-tagged GULP. The cells were then lysed on tissue culture plates using immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, which was followed by incubation with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at 4° C and precipitation with protein A-conjugated agarose (Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The coprecipitated stabilin-2 or GULP was then detected by immunoblotting using anti-stabilin-2 or anti-FLAG antibody, respectively.For the GST pulldown assay, the lysates from L/Stab-2 cells were incubated with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4° C. Next, the beads were then washed three times with the wash buffer, and the precipitated Myc-tagged stabilin-2 protein was then detected using anti-Myc antibody. GST fusion proteins used in the experiments were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.Transduction of TAT Fusion Proteins—The PTB domain of GULP was cloned in-frame into a bacterial expression vector, pTAT-GFP, to produce TAT-PTB-GFP proteins. The vector pTAT-GFP has an N-terminal 11-amino acid TAT protein transduction domain followed by a polylinker, the coding region corresponding to GFP protein, and the His6 tag. GFP-TAT protein was used as a control. The purification protocol was adapted from a published procedure using a Ni-NTA column (21Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial pellets were resuspended in buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), and 8 m urea) and then sonicated. Addition of 8 m urea to the buffer allows for the isolation of insoluble proteins in bacterial inclusion bodies and efficient transduction into cells. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen). Bound proteins were eluted by the stepwise addition of 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole in the above buffer. Urea was removed by rapid dialysis using a desalting PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.For the transduction of TAT fusion protein, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. The cells were then kept in serum-free DMEM for 2 h. TAT fusion proteins were added to a final concentration of 500 nm in serum-free media and then incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing, to identify the uptake of TAT fusion proteins, fluorescence derived from bound proteins was quenched using trypan blue. The uptake of TAT fusion proteins was then confirmed via flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences).Phagocytosis of Aged RBCs—Aged red blood cells were prepared by incubating the cells in phosphate-buffered saline (20% hematocrit) at 37 °C as described previously (22Oka K. Sawamura T. Kikuta K. Itokawa S. Kume N. Kita T. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9535-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Exposure of PS on the cell surface was detected via annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate using an annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Next, aged RBCs were added to the L/Stab-2 cells and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing away the unbound RBCs, the uningested RBCs were lysed via the addition of deionized H2O for 10 s, which was followed by immediate replacement with DMEM as described previously (23Ogden C.A. deCathelineau A. Hoffmann P.R. Bratton D. Ghebrehiwet B. Fadok V.A. Henson P.M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The cells were then fixed with methanol and stained using a Diff Quick staining kit (IMEB Inc.). The phagocytosis of the aged RBCs was then quantified via light microscopy following hypotonic lysis. The percentages of phagocytosis were determined as the percentages of phagocytes that were positive for engulfment as described previously (18Park S.Y. Jung M.Y. Kim H.J. Lee S.J. Kim S.Y. Lee B.H. Kwon T.H. Park R.W. Kim I.S. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). At least 100 cells were scored per well, and all experiments were repeated at least three times. In certain experiments, TAT fusion proteins were preincubated with L/Stab-2 cells for 5 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing, aged RBCs were added, and the percentages of phagocytosis were determined as above.Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—The stabilin-2 cDNA corresponding to the cytoplasmic region of stabilin-2 (wild type, amino acids 2461–2551), as well as the APXA mutant form, was subcloned into the pGBKT7 to produce Gal4 transcription binding domain fusion proteins. The GULP cDNA corresponding to the PTB domain of GULP (amino acids 1–145) was subcloned into pGBDT7 to produce Gal4 transcription activation domain fusion protein. Specific pairs of constructs expressing activation domain and binding domain fusion proteins were transformed into the yeast strain AH109 (Clontech). Transformants were selected on synthetic dropout (SD) medium that lacked leucine and tryptophan (SD/-Leu/-Trp). Individual colonies were streaked on high stringency medium (SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-α-galactosidase) in the presence of 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to test for activation of the reporter genes ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1.Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance was assessed by the ANOVA test. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSGULP Directly Binds to Stabilin-2—To examine the interaction of GULP with stabilin-2, we transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells with Myc-tagged stabilin-2 and FLAG-tagged GULP constructs, and then tested whether stabilin-2 and GULP could form a complex. As shown in Fig. 1A (left panels), a Myc tag-specific antibody, but not an isotype-matched control antibody, resulted in the precipitation of Myc-stabilin-2 with FLAG-GULP. In addition, when reverse experiments were conducted, Myc-stabilin-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-GULP using a FLAG tag-specific antibody, but this did not occur when an isotype-matched control IgG was used (Fig. 1A, middle panels). To further test whether stabilin-2 and GULP bind directly, we expressed a His-tagged stabilin-2 protein corresponding to a cytoplasmic region and a GST fusion GULP protein in bacteria, and we then performed an in vitro binding assay using these recombinant proteins. The results showed that His-tagged stabilin-2 cytoplasmic tail associated with the GST fusion GULP but not with control GST protein (Fig. 1B), which suggests that there is a direct interaction between these two proteins.To directly show the interaction between stabilin-2 and GULP in cells, we performed a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis using eGFP tagged to the C terminus of the stabilin-2 (stabilin-2-eGFP) as a donor and mCherry tagged to the N terminus of GULP (mCherry-GULP) as an acceptor. This pair of probes was co-expressed in COS7 cells and subjected to confocal microscopic analysis. The digital images were acquired through eGFP, mCherry, and FRET channels from a single cell. Because FRET from eGFP to mCherry only occurs if the two proteins are in very close proximity (<50 Å), stabilin-2-GULP interactions should be assessed by measuring a corrected FRET (FRETC) value that is calculated for the entire image on a pixel-by-pixel basis using a three-filter “micro-FRET” method and is presented as a quantitative pseudocolor image (20Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Increased FRETC was detected at the plasma membranes in COS7 cells expressing stabilin-2-eGFP and mCherry-GULP (Fig. 1C); however, such an increase in FRETC at the membrane sites was not observed when the control eGFP protein was used as donor. Taken together, these results indicate that stabilin-2 directly interacts with GULP in cells.GULP Is Required for Stabilin-2-mediated Phagocytosis—To test the functional requirement of GULP in stabilin-2-mediated phagocytosis, we designed siRNAs against the mouse GULP using the Dicer system, and then conducted experiments to assess the effects of the siRNA on the expression of endogenous GULP mRNA and protein using RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Treatment with GULP siRNA significantly inhibited the expression of GULP mRNA (Fig. 2A) and reduced the expression of GULP protein by ∼60% (Fig. 2B). However, no reduction was observed in the expression of stabilin-2 or actin in the same cell lysates. To investigate the functional role in stabilin-2-mediated phagocytosis, we examined the effect of GULP siRNA on the phagocytic activity of stabilin-2-expressing cells (L/Stab-2 cells). We selected aged RBCs as target cells because they do not bind to phagocytes without apoptotic signals and allow the distinction between binding and engulfment via hypotonic lysis (24Gigli I. Nelson Jr., R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 51: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, all aged RBCs shown inside of L/Stab-2 cells are supposed to be engulfed ones after hypotonic lysis (Fig. 2C, arrowheads). Pretreatment with GULP siRNA significantly inhibited the uptake of aged RBCs in stabilin-2-expressing cells (L/Stab-2 cells) (Fig. 2, C and D); however, these effects were not observed when L/Stab-2 cells were treated with control GFP siRNA. This result suggests that GULP plays a key role in stabilin-2-mediated phagocytosis. To further investigate a functional link between stabilin-2 and GULP, we used an alternative approach to assess the effects of overexpressing GULP on the phagocytic activity of L/Stab-2 cells. We generated recombinant retrovirus expressing human GULP for infection into L/Mock or L/Stab-2 cells. Overexpression of GULP increased the uptake of aged RBCs by ∼30% in L/Stab-2 cells when compared with control infection (Fig. 3, A and B). Conversely, L/Mock cells did not engulf aged RBCs in the presence or absence of GULP. These results corroborate our findings that the suppression of endogenous GULP expression results in a significant reduction of aged RBC engulfment and indicates that GULP functions as an adaptor molecule that facilitates the stabilin-2"

However, a significant proportion of patients suffer a relapse after a few years of hormone therapy. The androgen-independent stage of prostate cancer has been shown to be associated with the development of neuroendocrine differentiation. We previously demonstrated that neuroendocrine prostate cancer cells derived from LNCaP cells overexpress CaV3.2 T-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. We demonstrate here using prostatic acid phosphatase as a marker of prostate secretion and FM1-43 fluorescence imaging of membrane trafficking that neuroendocrine differentiation is associated with an increase in calcium-dependent secretion which critically relies on CaV3.2 T-type calcium channel activity. In addition, we show that these channels are expressed by neuroendocrine cells in prostate cancer tissues obtained from patients after surgery. We propose that CaV3.2 T-type calcium channel up-regulation may account for the alteration of secretion during prostate cancer development and that these channels, by promoting the secretion of potential mitogenic factors, could participate in the progression of the disease toward an androgen-independent stage.

Prostate cancer is, in its early stages, an androgen-dependent pathology, meaning that its progression relies on the presence of active steroid male hormones. Treatments developed for many years have been based on this characteristic feature of prostate cancer and, thus, aimed at decreasing the plasma concentration of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, the prostate active androgen. Although these treatments are particularly valuable in the early development of the disease, leading to the regression of cancers, about a third of the patients suffer a relapse after a few years of hormone therapy. At this stage of hormone refractory disease, deprivation of androgens has no further incidence on the growth of the prostate cancer, and no curative therapy is currently effective (for review, see Ref. 1Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). The androgen-independent stage of prostate cancer has been shown to be associated with, among others, the development of neuroendocrine differentiation (2Weinstein M.H. Partin A.W. Veltri R.W. Epstein J.I. Hum. Pathol. 1996; 27: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These neuroendocrine features include the appearance of neuroendocrine cell foci surrounded by proliferating epithelial cells (3Bonkhoff H. Wernert N. Dhom G. Remberger K. Prostate. 1991; 19: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because neuroendocrine prostate cells in normal, hyperplastic, or cancerous tissue secrete many neuropeptides with mitogenic activities like parathyroid hormone-related peptide, calcitonin, or gastrin-related peptides, it has been proposed that paracrine secretion of neurosecretory products released by neuroendocrine cells could be responsible for the progression of cancer toward an androgen-independent stage (for review, see Ref. 4Bonkhoff H. Prostate. 1998; : 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown for instance that the expression of neuroendocrine markers like chromogranin A is correlated with tumor dedifferentiation (5Theodoropoulos V.E. Tsigka A. Mihalopoulou A. Tsoukala V. Lazaris A.C. Patsouris E. Ghikonti I. Urology. 2005; 66: 897-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and that the presence of neuroendocrine cells in prostate cancer is correlated to a negative prognosis (6Cohen R.J. Glezerson G. Haffejee Z. Afrika D. Br. J. Urol. 1990; 66: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that neuroendocrine cells lack the androgen receptor (4Bonkhoff H. Prostate. 1998; : 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7Yuan T.C. Veeramani S. Lin F.F.

A neuroendocrine differentiation model has been developed using LNCaP cells whose differentiation can be induced by various means, e.g. activation of the protein kinase A pathway, interleukin-6 receptor activation, or steroid depletion (8Bang Y.J. Pirnia F. Fang W.G. Kang W.K. Sartor O. Whitesell L. Ha M.J. Tsokos M. Sheahan M.D. Nguyen P. Niklinski W.T. Myers C.E. Trepel J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In a previous study (11Mariot P. Vanoverberghe K. Lalevee N. Rossier M.F. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that neuroendocrine prostate LNCaP cells (LNCaP-NE) overexpress a voltage-dependent calcium current of the T-type family. The channel subunit involved in this calcium current was shown to be the CaV3.2 (α1H) pore subunit. The role of this calcium channel in allegedly non-excitable cells remains elusive. We supposed from morphological evidence that the T-type calcium channel was involved in the extension of neurites during the neuroendocrine differentiation process. In other cell models, the T-type calcium channel function has been attributed to pacemaker activity, gene expression, or development. In recent studies T-type calcium currents have been shown to be responsible for exocytosis in acrosomal reaction (12Darszon A. Lopez-Martinez P. Acevedo J.J. Hernandez-Cruz A. Trevino C.L. Cell Calcium. 2006; 40: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or synaptic transmission in neurons or chromaffin cells (13Carbone E. Giancippoli A. Marcantoni A. Guido D. Carabelli V.

Because neuroendocrine LNCaP cells have been shown to secrete more neuropeptides than non-differentiated LNCaP cells, we investigated both whether a calcium-dependent-regulated pathway was present in these cells and the putative role of T-type calcium channels in the secretion of LNCaP cells. We show in this article that LNCaP cells display a calcium-dependent pathway of regulated secretion and that neuroendocrine differentiation is associated with an increase in prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) 2The abbreviations used are:PAPprostatic acid phosphatasecPAPintracellular PAPsPAPsecreted PAPHBSSHank's balanced salt solutionPBSphosphate-buffered salineTGthapsigarginPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateCK18cytokeratine 18GFPgreen fluorescent proteinBHPbenign prostate hyperplasiaDIFMUP6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbellyferyl phosphatesiRNAsmall interfering RNAPSAprostate-specific antigenTMA-DPH1-(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6 phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene. secretion. We also show that T-type calcium channels could promote secretion upon membrane depolarization and that PAP secretion by LNCaP cells is dependent on T-type (α1H) calcium channel activity. In addition, we show that prostate cancer cells obtained after surgical removal of prostate biopsies express functional α1H T-type calcium channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that these channels colocalize with serotonin and chromogranin A neuroendocrine markers and cytokeratin 18, which shows the epithelial neuroendocrine nature of CaV3.2-expressing cells and are more abundant in human prostate cancer tissue samples than in hyperplasia. prostatic acid phosphatase intracellular PAP secreted PAP Hank's balanced salt solution phosphate-buffered saline thapsigargin phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate cytokeratine 18 green fluorescent protein benign prostate hyperplasia 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbellyferyl phosphate small interfering RNA prostate-specific antigen 1-(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6 phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene. Cell Culture and Treatments—LNCaP cells were cultured as previously described (11Mariot P. Vanoverberghe K. Lalevee N. Rossier M.F. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To induce neuroendocrine differentiation, LNCaP cells were cultured with 1 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP and 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine for 3-6 days. Stable cell lines expressing α1H protein (LNCaP-α1H) or α1H-GFP fusion protein (LNCaP-α1HGFP) or control LNCaP cell lines transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vector (LNCaP-Neo) were produced as previously reported (16Gackiere F. Bidaux G. Lory P. Prevarskaya N. Mariot P. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells from benign prostate hyperplasia (BHP cells) and from prostate carcinomas (hPCE cells) in primary culture were obtained and maintained in culture as previously described (17Thebault S. Roudbaraki M. Sydorenko V. Shuba Y. Lemonnier L. Slomianny C. Dewailly E. Bonnal J.L. Mauroy B. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. J. Clin.

Human prostate tissue specimens were obtained from resection surgeries performed on patients who gave informed consent and on clinical indications in the Urology Department at l'Hôpital St. Philibert. All experiments on human tissues were approved by the Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomedicale de Lille, Lille, France. Fluorescence Imaging—Fluorescence imaging was carried out in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 142 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, and 5.6 mm glucose. The osmolarity and pH of external solutions were adjusted to 310 mosmol.liter-1 and 7.4, respectively. Cytosolic calcium concentration was measured using Fura2-loaded cells (2 μm) as described elsewhere (11Mariot P. Vanoverberghe K. Lalevee N. Rossier M.F. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The intracellular calcium concentration was derived from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities for each of the excitation wavelengths (F340/F380) and from the Grynkiewicz et al. (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) equation. The cells were continuously perfused with the HBSS solution, and chemicals were added via a perfusion system. FM1-43 fluorescence was used as indicative of membrane traffic (20Brumback A.C. Lieber J.L. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Methods. 2004; 33: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). When cells are bathed in FM1-43 solution (5 μm), the dye (non-fluorescent in aqueous solution) is incorporated into the plasma membrane until equilibrium has been reached. The dye then becomes fluorescent in the lipid membrane environment. Fluorescence was excited at 480 nm and measured at 510 nm. TMA-DPH (1 μm) was also used as an indicator of membrane traffic as previously reported (22Masumoto N. Tasaka K. Mizuki J. Fukami K. Ikebuchi Y. Miyake A. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fluorescence protocols were essentially the same as with FM1-43. Because Fura2 and FM1-43 spectra do not cross over, combined Fura2 and FM1-43 measurements were performed as done by others (23Nunez L. Villalobos C. Boockfor F.R. Frawley L.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2012-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was alternately excited at 340, 380, and 480 nm and measured at 510 nm. All recordings were carried out at 35 °C. Electrophysiological Recordings—Patch clamp recordings were performed in the whole-cell configuration as previously described (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) using a RK-300 patch clamp amplifier (Biologic, Grenoble, France). Bath medium used for voltage clamp experiments contained 142 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm tetraethyl ammonium chloride, and 2 mm CaCl2. The osmolarity and pH of external buffers were adjusted to 310 mosmol.liter-1 and 7.4, respectively. Recording pipettes were filled with a solution containing 140 mm N-methyl glucamine, 110 mm l-glutamic acid, 30 mm HCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, with 0.1 or 1 mm EGTA. Osmolarity and pH were adjusted to 290 mosmol.liter-1 and 7.2, respectively. In some experiments voltage clamp experiments were combined on the same cell to calcium or FM1-43 imaging. Patch clamp experiments were carried out at room temperature except combined experiments which were performed at 35 °C. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal fluorescence analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Le Pecq, France) connected to a Zeiss Axiovert 200M with a ×63 oil-immersion objective lens (numerical aperture 1.4). For quantification analysis, the image acquisition characteristics (i.e. pinhole aperture, laser intensity, scan speed) were the same throughout the experiments to ensure the comparability of the results. AIM 3.2 confocal microscope software (Carl Zeiss) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Changes in FM1-43 fluorescence were monitored by excitation with a 477 nm line of a 20-milliwatt argon ion laser, and emission from the dye was collected through a 505-nm long-pass filter. Confocal immunofluorescence experiments were performed with an ×40 oil-immersion objective lens (numerical aperture 1.2) and illuminated separately with an argon ion laser and an helium/neon ion laser. 0.7-μm confocal slides were scanned to determine the localization of the targeting proteins. Immunofluorescence—1) LNCaP cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min, washed 3 times, then permeabilized in PBS, 1.2% gelatin complemented with 0.01% Tween 20 and 100 mm glycine for 30 min at 37 °C. 2) Resection specimens from human prostate were frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and kept in “Tissue-Tek®” at -80 °C before 10-μm sections were prepared at -20 °C with a cryostat and mounted on glass slides. The sections were blocked with PBS, 1.2% gelatin complemented with 0.01% Tween 20 for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated with primary antibodies: (1:500) rabbit polyclonal anti-Cav3.2 antibody (Alomon Labs), (1:200) mouse monoclonal anti-Serotonin antibody (Dako), (1:50) mouse monoclonal anti-chromogranin A antibody (Dako), (1:1000) mouse monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 18 antibody (Neomarkers), in PBS-gelatin completed with 5% donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After thorough washes, the slides were treated with the corresponding anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled with either Alexa fluor 546-labeled (Molecular Probes, dilution 1:4000) or Alexa fluor 488-labeled (dilution 1:2000) diluted in PBS-gelatin for 1 h at room temperature. After 2 washes in PBS and a last wash in PBS + 1:200 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min, the slides were mounted with Mowiol®. Prostatic Acid Phosphatase Secretion—For the PAP assay, we used two methods. The first is a Sigma colorimetric procedure (Sigma, unit·ml-1) in which p-nitrophenol phosphate was used as the substrate to quantify the acid phosphatase activity at pH 4.8 by measuring the absorbance of released p-nitrophenol at 405 nm (25Lin M.F. Zhang X.Q. Dean J. Lin F.F. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Sigma units were transformed in IU·ml-1 according to the Sigma protocol (1 sigma unit·ml-1 equals 16.7 mIU·ml-1. Sigma protocol sheet). The second method is a sensitive fluorimetric assay (Molecular Probes, mIU·ml-1) based on the cleavage of 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbellyferyl phosphate (DIFMUP) by phosphatases (26Gee K.R. Sun W.C. Bhalgat M.K. Upson R.H. Klaubert D.H. Latham K.A. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), generating DIFMU, whose fluorescence was excited at 360 nm and measured at 450 nm. In prostate cells the L(+)-tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase activity has conventionally been used to represent PAP activity (25Lin M.F. Zhang X.Q. Dean J. Lin F.F. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Viability Tests—Cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric method (CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega). siRNA Design and Cell Preparation—Small interfering RNAs against the human coding sequence of CaV3.2 calcium channels (GenBank™ accession number NM-021098.2) were designed, and two selective sequences, referred to as si-α1H1 and si-α1H2, were selected to knock down T-type α1H calcium channel expression. siRNAs used in this study included a nonspecific siRNA (si-Ctl) control with at least four mismatches with any human genes. Sense sequences of siRNAs were 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-3′ (si-Ctl), 5′-ACGUGAGCGCAUGCUGGUAAUdTdT-3′ (si-α1H1, position 311-329 from ATG), and 5′-AGAUGGCCGUGGCGUCUAUdTdT-3′ (si-α1H2, position 2166-2184 from ATG). siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon (France). LNCaP-CTL, LNCaP-α1H, or LNCaP-α1HGFP cells were transfected with either 5, 25, or 50 nm siRNA anti-α1H1, anti-α1H2, or siRNA-Ctl using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). siRNAs were incubated in culture medium without serum for 5-10 min at room temperature to form the transfection complexes and were then added dropwise onto the cells. The medium was then changed as required, and gene silencing could be studied after an appropriate time depending on experimental set-up. Analysis of the α1H Subunit Gene Expression of a Voltage-dependent T-type Calcium Channel (Reverse Transcription-PCR)—Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out as previously described (16Gackiere F. Bidaux G. Lory P. Prevarskaya N. Mariot P. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used to amplify the 177-bp α1H amplicon were 5′-TCGAGGAGGACTTCCACAAG (forward) and 5′-TGCATCCAGGAATGGTGAG (reverse), and those used to amplify the 220-bp β-actin amplicon were 5′-CAGAGCAAGAGAGGCATCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACGTACATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAA-3′ (reverse). Western Blot Assay—Western blot analysis of protein expression in LNCaP-NE or LNCaP-α1HGFP cells (control or siRNA-transfected) were designed as described elsewhere (11Mariot P. Vanoverberghe K. Lalevee N. Rossier M.F. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used in this study were anti-GFP (1:1000, rabbit, Abcam), anti-PAP (1:100, rabbit, Interchim), anti-β-actin (1:400, mouse, Sigma), or anti-calnexin (1:1000, mouse, Chemicon International, Inc.). Chemicals—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except for Fura2-AM which was bought from Calbiochem. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t tests (for comparing two groups) or analysis of variance tests followed by either Dunnett (for multiple control versus test comparisons) or Student-Newman-Keuls post-tests (for multiple comparisons). Differences were considered significant where p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***). Calcium-dependent secretion was first investigated on LNCaP cell populations, and the concentration of prostatic-specific PAP in the incubation medium was used as an index of exocytotic secretion because PAP was shown to be distributed in secretory granules (8Bang Y.J. Pirnia F. Fang W.G. Kang W.K. Sartor O. Whitesell L. Ha M.J. Tsokos M. Sheahan M.D. Nguyen P. Niklinski W.T. Myers C.E. Trepel J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5330-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To assess whether PAP secretion could be stimulated by a calcium rise, we incubated the cells with various agents raising cytosolic calcium like thapsigargin (TG, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPases) or ionomycin (a calcium ionophore) and with different external calcium concentrations (0, 0.75, or 1.5 mm CaCl2). As shown in Fig. 1A, the amount of PAP measured with a colorimetric assay increased in both cell lysates and culture media when stimulated by either TG or ionomycin. In addition, TG- or ionomycin-induced secretion was blocked by removing calcium from the culture medium (Fig. 1A) or was potentiated by increasing the calcium concentration from 0.75 to 1.5 mm (not shown). Using DIFMUP as a PAP substrate, we were able to detect PAP secretion within 30 min of incubation. As shown in Fig. 1B, a 30-min incubation period in a culture medium containing 0.75 mm CaCl2 with TG and ionomycin almost doubled the amount of PAP secreted in the culture medium (control 3.1 ± 0.7, ionomycin 5.6 ± 0.6, TG 4.7 ± 0.4, 10-3 IU·ml-1). To clamp external calcium concentrations more efficiently (0-5 mm), we carried out some experiments in HBSS. Basal PAP secretion increased in the presence of 5 mm calcium (3.4 ± 0.2 10-3 IU·ml-1 in calcium-free conditions versus 6.2 ± 0.3 10-3 IU·ml-1 in 5 mm external calcium, Fig. 1C). Furthermore, ionomycin-stimulated PAP secretion required the presence of calcium in the external medium. In addition, when LNCaP cells were treated with protein synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide (200 μm) and anisomycin (300 μm)), the amount of PAP released in the incubation medium after 1 h was not altered in either basal or stimulated conditions (2 μm ionomycin). In contrast, PAP secreted in the culture medium after 24 h of incubation was abrogated by protein synthesis inhibition (Fig. 1D) in both basal and stimulated conditions. Ionomycin and thapsigargin at the concentrations used in this study (1-2 μm for ionomycin and 10-20 nm for thapsigargin) did not induce any significant cell death nor any increase in cell proliferation (not shown) within 48 h, which could have been responsible for any apparent variations in PAP concentrations. To further investigate the calcium-dependent secretion of LNCaP cells, we carried out fluorescence imaging of FM1-43 and TMA-DPH, fluorescent lipophilic dies used for tracking membrane traffic (for review, see Refs. 20Brumback A.C. Lieber J.L. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Methods. 2004; 33: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar and 21Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). When FM1-43 was admitted into the perfusion chamber, cell fluorescence progressively reached a stable level. At this stage, as observed in both conventional imaging and confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A), FM1-43 fluorescence was preferentially localized at the cell periphery, indicating plasma membrane location. When admitted into the bath, ionomycin (2 μm) rapidly increased FM1-43 or TMA-DPH fluorescence (see Fig. 2). On average, ionomycin increased FM1-43 fluorescence by 106 ± 7% (n = 150) and 38 ± 2% (n = 97) in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium, respectively. Similarly, thapsigargin (20 nm) induced a rise in FM1-43 fluorescence of 31 ± 2% (n = 106) and 15 ± 6% (n = 32) in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium, respectively. Combined Fura2 and FM1-43 fluorescence measurements (Fig. 2B) show that ionomycin and thapsigargin induced cytosolic calcium peaks that were rapidly followed by increases in FM1-43 fluorescence. In some cases, ionomycin-induced calcium peaks were biphasic, and the increase in FM1-43 fluorescence correlated with either of the calcium transients. In any cases, as emphasized on Fig. 2B, the sharpest rise in FM1-43 fluorescence occurred during the rising phase of the calcium peaks. Because FM1-43 is able to be progressively incorporated in intracellular membrane organelles such as secretory granules through endocytosis (20Brumback A.C. Lieber J.L. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Methods. 2004; 33: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we incubated LNCaP cells overnight in 5 μm FM1-43 diluted in culture medium. Then, cells were washed with FM1-43 free HBSS to remove FM1-43 from the plasma membrane. The dye was incorporated into intracellular membrane compartments as shown by confocal microscopy by a punctuated fluorescence inside the cell (Fig. 2E). When submitted to 1 μm ionomycin, the FM1-43 fluorescence inside the cell decreased after a 1-min time lag (% of decrease (ΔF/F0) = 8.7 ± 2.2, n = 68). This probably reflects the release by exocytosis of FM1-43 previously incorporated by membrane retrieval in intracellular organelle membranes such as secretory granules. This demonstrates that FM1-43 incorporates at least partially into immediately releasable secretory pools and, thus, confirms that FM1-43 is a good LNCaP cell membrane traffic marker. Neuroendocrine differentiation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, induced by treatments increasing cytosolic cAMP, was shown to be associated with an increase in neuropeptide secretion (27Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Lakhani S. Parsons S.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3821-3830PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study PAP secreted in the incubation medium for 1 h increased in both basal (by 36 ± 1.2%) and ionomycin-stimulated (by 48 ± 3.5%) conditions in neuroendocrine LNCaP cells (LNCaP-NE) as compared with undifferentiated LNCaP cells (LNCaP-CTL), confirming an increase in secretory potency after neuroendocrine differentiation. Furthermore, we show by immunofluorescence confocal detection (Fig. 3) that LNCaP-NE cells express chromogranin A, a marker of regulated secretion, and serotonin (5-HT), a neurotransmitter. We then carried out experiments to assess whether α1H (CaV3.2) T-type calcium channels could be involved in PAP secretion. Indeed, as previously published (11Mariot P. Vanoverberghe K. Lalevee N. Rossier M.F. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10824-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Gackiere F. Bidaux G. Lory P. Prevarskaya N. Mariot P. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and as displayed on Fig. 3, LNCaP-NE cells have an increased expression of T-type calcium currents. We show here using a CaV3.2 antibody that LNCaP-NE cells indeed overexpress CaV3.2 calcium channels (Fig. 3). We conducted experiments using T-type calcium channel inhibitors and small interfering RNAs raised against α1H channels (two different sets of siRNA: si-α1H1 and si-α1H2). CaV3.2 T-type calcium channels overexpressed in LNCaP cells could be inhibited by flunarizine (89.5% inhibition at 10 μm, n = 10), nickel chloride (45% inhibition at 20 μm, n = 10), and kurtoxin (92.3% inhibition at 500 nm, n = 10) (data not shown). To validate the siRNAs used in this study, we have shown using patch clamp experiments in LNCaP stably transfected with α1H-GFP (LNCaP-α1HGFP) that the expression of T-type calcium currents was inhibited with siRNA concentrations as low as 5 nm (Fig. 4A). Indeed, inhibition was already maximal at 5 nm with both si-α1H1 and si-α1H2 48 h after siRNA treatment. The inhibition began to reverse 4 and 7 days after the onset of siRNAs"
https://openalex.org/W1969545266,"We demonstrate that purified recombinant human betainehomocysteine methyltransferase-2 (BHMT-2) is a zinc metalloenzyme that uses S-methylmethionine (SMM) as a methyl donor for the methylation of homocysteine. Unlike the highly homologous betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), BHMT-2 cannot use betaine. The Km of BHMT-2 for SMM was determined to be 0.94 mm, and it has a turnover number similar to BHMT. Several compounds were tested as inhibitors of recombinant human BHMT and BHMT-2. The SMM-specific methyltransferase activity of BHMT-2 is not inhibited by dimethylglycine and betaine, whereas the former is a potent inhibitor of BHMT. Methionine is a stronger inhibitor of BHMT-2 than BHMT, and S-adenosylmethionine does not inhibit BHMT but is a weak inhibitor of BHMT-2. BHMT can use SMM as a methyl donor with a kcat/Km that is 5-fold lower than the kcat/Km for betaine. However, SMM does not inhibit BHMT activity when it is presented to the enzyme at concentrations that are 10-fold greater than the subsaturating amounts of betaine used in the assay. Based on these data, it is our current hypothesis that in vivo most if not all of the SMM-dependent methylation of homocysteine occurs via BHMT-2.

Homocysteine (Hcy) 3The abbreviations used are: HcyhomocysteineBHMTbetaine-homocysteine methyltransferaseBHMT-2betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase-2CBHcyS-(δ-carboxybutyl)-l-homocysteineDMGdimethylglycineDMSPdimethylsulfoniopropionateAdoMetS-adenosylmethionineAdoHcyS-adenosylhomocysteineSMMS-methylmethionineHMTHcy methyltransferaseDMSAdimethylsulfonioacetate. is derived from methionine (Met) and can either be methylated to reform Met (i.e. remethylation) or participate in cysteine biosynthesis via the transsulfuration pathway. Hcy remethylation in mammals has always been attributed to two different enzymes: cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT; EC 2.1.1.5). Methionine synthase uses 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor and is expressed in all tissues at very low levels, whereas BHMT uses betaine (Bet) as the methyl donor and is only expressed in the liver and kidney, but at very high levels (1Finkelstein J.D.

Apart from the mammalian methyltransferases described above, the existence of other Hcy methyltransferase (HMT) activities in rat liver extracts, namely S-methylmethionine (SMM)- and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-HMT, were reported by Shapiro and Yphantis in the late fifties (4Shapiro S.K. Yphantis D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 36: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). SMM, also known as vitamin U, is an analog of AdoMet, with a methyl group substituted for the adenosyl group. This amino acid is a major sulfur containing metabolite of many plants (5Kim G. Food Sci. Tech. Res. 2003; 9: 316-319Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Hanson A.D. Rivoal J. Paquet L. Gage D.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Grunau J.M. Commun. Soil Sci. Plant Anal. 1991; 22: 1873-1882Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) but it is not known to be synthesized by mammals. In 2000, Chadwick et al. (8Chadwick L.H. McCandless S.E. Silverman G.L. Schwartz S. Westaway D. Nadeau J.H. Genomics. 2000; 70: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported mouse and human cDNA sequences whose deduced amino acid sequences had very high homology to BHMT. They were named Bhmt-2 and BHMT-2, respectively, even though their enzymatic activities were not determined. Like human BHMT, the human BHMT-2 mRNA was shown to be abundantly expressed in liver and kidney. BHMT and BHMT-2 are adjacent to each other on human chromosome 5 (5q13), suggesting they are tandem duplicates. We demonstrate herein that the translational product of the cDNA named BHMT-2 is a zinc metalloenzyme that methylates Hcy using SMM, and to a much lesser extent, AdoMet as methyl donors in vitro. We also show that purified recombinant human BHMT has SMM-HMT activity. Materials—4-(2-Pyridylazo)resorcinol was purchased from Sigma. Dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA) was a gift from Nutriquest. SMM iodide was purchased from Acros Biochemicals, Inc. l-[methyl-14C]S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (52.8 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled AdoMet was obtained from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were of the highest purity available from commercial vendors. Generation of the Human BHMT-2 Intein/Chitin Binding Fusion Construct (pTBY3-hBHMT-2)—The cDNA encoding human BHMT-2 (accession number AF257473) was a gift from Dr. Joseph Nadeau (Case Western Reserve University). The BHMT-2 cDNA was amplified by PCR with Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene) and the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-ATATATACCATGGCACCTGCTGGAC-3′ and 5′-TATATAGCTCTTCCGCAGAAGTCTGGCTTTGAC-3′. The reverse primer was designed to oblate the stop codon and introduce a unique SapI site in the cDNA so as to fuse it with the intein/chitin-binding sequence of the pTBY3 vector. The PCR product and pTYB3 were digested with NcoI and SapI, gel purified, ligated together, and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The pTBY3-hBHMT-2 construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Overexpression and Purification of Human BHMT and Human BHMT-2—BHMT and BHMT-2 were purified using the IMPACT™-T7 protein purification system (New England Biolabs) as described by Breska and Garrow (9Breksa 3rd, A.P. Garrow T.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13991-13998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Minor changes included the use of protease inhibitors during the isolation of BHMT-2, on-column cleavage of BHMT at ambient temperature rather than 4 °C, and enzymes were concentrated as needed using Amicon Centricon YM-30 cartridges. Enzymes were dialyzed against buffer (20–50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) containing modest amounts of dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol, and either 20% (BHMT) or 40% (BHMT-2) glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined by a Coomassie Blue dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Zinc Binding Assays—To determine the zinc content of the enzymes a microplate-based, spectroscopic assay utilizing the zinc chelator 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol was performed. Aliquots of BHMT or BHMT-2 (10 μm final concentration) were digested for 15 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm CaCl2, and 3 units of proteinase K (Sigma). Also, a 1-ml mock digest containing buffer alone was used for a background spectroscopic reference and to generate a zinc chloride standard curve (1, 5, 7.5, 12.5, and 25 μm). Ninety μl of each digest was distributed into a 96-well microplate and thoroughly mixed with 90 μl of 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 800 mm NaCl, and 200 μm 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol). The absorbance of each sample was measured at 500 nm and compared against the standard curve to determine zinc content. All digest reactions were done in triplicate. SMM Synthesis—l-[methyl-14C]SMM was synthesized from l-[methyl-14C]Met essentially as described (10Lavine T.F. Floyd N.F. Cammaroti M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 207: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Two ml of l-[methyl-14C]Met (Moravek Biochemicals; 55 mCi/mmol) was dried down in an Eppendorf Vacufuge 5301 at 60 °C to remove ethanol. The Met was then resuspended in 225 μl of a solution containing 5.4 m HCl and 2.7 m methanol and transferred to a 0.3-ml Reacti-Vial and incubated for 17 h at 100 °C. The reaction mixture was then diluted to 2 ml with ddH2O and dried down at 45 °C. The material was then resuspended in 1 ml of ddH2O and applied to 1-ml Dowex® 1-X4 (OH–, 200 mesh; Sigma) and Bio-Rex®70 (H+; Bio-Rad) columns arranged in tandem. The 2-column arrangement was washed (2 × 5 ml) with ddH2O. The Bio-Rex column (containing l-[methyl-14C]SMM) was then washed (2 × 5 ml) with ddH2O, followed by elution of the product with 5 ml of 1 m HCl. This procedure resulted in conversion of ∼90% of the l-[methyl-14C]Met to l-[methyl-14C]SMM. Aliquots (250 μl) of l-[methyl-14C]SMM in 1 m HCl were dried down at 45 °C, resuspended in 250 μl of ddH2O and dried down at 45 °C, and resuspended in 125 or 250 μl of 5 mm H2SO4 and 10 mm ethanol for use in enzyme assays. Enzyme Assays—BHMT activity was assayed as previously described (3Garrow T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). SMM-HMT activity was assayed by the same procedure because like Bet, SMM does not bind to Dowex 1-X4 OH– resin. The concentration of substrates, total assay volume, and amount of enzyme varied in different experiments as indicated in the table legends. Some experiments used 50 mm (final) Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) rather than 50 mm (final) Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in the assay mixture. No difference in enzymatic activity was detected between the two buffers. Radiolabeled SMM and AdoMet were supplemented with cold SMM iodide and AdoMet (New England Biolabs), respectively, to achieve the desired concentration of each methyl donor. Concentrations of unlabeled AdoMet or AdoHcy were determined by UV spectroscopy using a molar extinction coefficient of 15,400. Inhibition assays used the same buffer conditions as the standard assays, except that 0.2 or 2 mm Bet, Met, DMG, DMSA, DMSP, SMM, AdoMet, AdoHcy, or SMM, or 50 or 500 μm S-(δ-carboxybutyl)-l-homocysteine (CBHcy: a transition state analog and potent inhibitor of BHMT activity (11Awad Jr., W.M. Whitney P.L. Skiba W.E. Mangum J.H. Wells M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12790-12792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was present. The Km of BHMT and BHMT-2 for SMM were determined in the same buffer conditions as the standard assay, except that 270 nCi of radioactivity and varying concentrations of SMM (0.1–9 mm final) were used. Reaction tubes were kept in ice-water until transferred to a 37 °C water bath to initiate the reaction. Assays were incubated for 1 h and then stopped by transferring the tubes back to an ice-water bath. One to 3 ml of cold ddH2O was then added to each reaction. Unreacted radiolabeled methyl donor (Bet, SMM, or AdoMet) was separated from radiolabeled product (Met) for each reaction by application to a 1-ml ion exchange column. For reactions containing Bet or SMM, samples were applied to Dowex 1-X4 OH– columns and subsequently washed with (3 × 5 ml) cold ddH2Oto remove unreacted substrate. Met was eluted into scintillation vials by the addition of 3 ml of 1.5 n HCl. Seventeen ml of scintillation fluid (Scinti-Safe™ Econo 1, Fisher Scientific) was then added and counted. For AdoMet-containing reactions, samples were applied to Bio-Rex 70 H+ columns (12Holcomb E.R. Shapiro S.K. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 267-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the flow-through (containing Met) was collected into a vial. The column was then washed (3 × 3 ml) with cold ddH2O and collected in the same vial, which then was capped, briefly vortexed, and a portion (3 ml) transferred to a scintillation vial. Seventeen ml of scintillation fluid was then added and counted. Resultant counts were multiplied by 3.33 to represent the disintegrations/min in 10 ml. For all reactions, blank reactions without enzyme were counted, and their values were subtracted from samples containing enzyme. All assays were done in duplicate or triplicate, had an average standard deviation of 3.1%, and are reported as means. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism 4 software. Comparative Amino Acid Sequence and Structural Analysis of Human BHMT and Human BHMT-2—The BHMT-2 gene encodes for a 40-kDa protein that shares 73% sequence identity with the 45-kDa BHMT protein (8Chadwick L.H. McCandless S.E. Silverman G.L. Schwartz S. Westaway D. Nadeau J.H. Genomics. 2000; 70: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments indicate that both BHMT proteins belong to a family of thiol/selenol methyltransferases (Pfam 02574). Pfam 02574 members contain conserved Hcy and zinc binding motifs. The alignment of BHMT and BHMT-2 presented in Fig. 1 highlight two regions where these proteins significantly differ. First, BHMT contains a region (residues 86–94) that is not found in BHMT-2. Second, the C terminus of BHMT is 43 residues longer than BHMT-2. Both BHMT proteins have sequence segments in their C terminus that are not found in other Pfam 02574 members. These regions have been shown to participate in the oligomerization of BHMT (13Evans J.C. Huddler D.P. Jiracek J. Castro C. Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Ludwig M.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1159-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Szegedi S.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A monomeric theoretical model of human BHMT-2 was generated using Swiss model 3.5 software (Fig. 2). The structures of human BHMT (PDB file 1LT8) (13Evans J.C. Huddler D.P. Jiracek J. Castro C. Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Ludwig M.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1159-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and rat liver BHMT (PDB file 1UMY) (15Gonzalez B. Pajares M.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Blundell T.L. Sanz-Aparicio J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were used as modeling templates. Like BHMT, the theoretical structure of BHMT-2 is comprised of a (β/α)8 barrel, two loops positioned over the C-terminal ends of the barrel strands, and an extended substructure referred to as a “dimerization” arm for BHMT (13Evans J.C. Huddler D.P. Jiracek J. Castro C. Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Ludwig M.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1159-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Key residues involved in BHMT dimerization are conserved in BHMT-2, including Leu264, Glu266, Pro268, Phe269, Val275, Trp279, Arg346, Trp352, Ala358, and Arg361. Residues involved in BHMT tetramerization are also conserved in BHMT-2, including Pro316, Leu321, Gly329, and Ser330. In addition, the BHMT tetramer has a strong ion pair between Lys349 and Glu387 (15Gonzalez B. Pajares M.A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Blundell T.L. Sanz-Aparicio J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but in BHMT-2 the Lys349 is occupied by Arg350. An examination of the putative BHMT-2 active site reveals three conserved cysteine residues (Cys208, Cys290, and Cys291) that are analogous to residues in BHMT (Cys217, Cys299, and Cys300) that participate in zinc binding (Fig. 3). The BHMT-2 active site also is laced with residues analogous to BHMT residues that participate in substrate binding. Glu159 and backbone residues of αB (Gly27, Phe29, and Val30) are important Hcy binding determinants in BHMT. Similarly, Glu150 is predicted to be at the same position in BHMT-2, although the interactions of the carboxyl moiety of Hcy with the backbone amido and carbonyl groups of Gly27, Phe29, and Leu30 are retained. Residues Trp44, Tyr77, and Tyr160 have been shown to be Bet binding determinants in BHMT (16Castro C. Gratson A.A. Evans J.C. Jiracek J. Collinsova M. Ludwig M.L. Garrow T.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5341-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The equivalent residues Trp44, Ser77, and Tyr151 are found in or near the active site of BHMT-2. In addition, His338 of one monomer was found to have a role in Bet binding at the active site of the opposite monomer in a BHMT dimer (14Szegedi S.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this residue is conserved in BHMT-2. These observations predict, from a sequence and structural perspective, that BHMT-2 is a functional zinc metalloenzyme that performs Hcy methylation and has potential to oligomerize with itself and perhaps with BHMT.FIGURE 3Structural superposition of the active sites of structure 1LT8 (gray, human BHMT with CBHCy bound) and the model (blue, human BHMT-2). Positions of pertinent residues are indicated. This figure was generated using the PyMOL Molecular Visualization System.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enzymatic Properties of Purified Human BHMT and Human BHMT-2—SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that recombinant human BHMT and BHMT-2 proteins were at least ∼90% pure, and had molecular masses similar to their predicted sizes of 45 and 40 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4). As expected, BHMT and BHMT-2 preparations were replete with metal, having zinc: monomer ratios of 1.1 and 0.98, respectively. Early attempts at purifying BHMT-2 resulted in very low yields, and, after identification of its enzyme activity, it was noted to rapidly lose catalytic potential. In contrast, wild type BHMT is very stable, even at low concentrations in buffers without stabilizing agents such as glycerol or ethylene glycol. However, we previously showed that truncating BHMT at the C terminus (deleting residues after Asp371), which reduces the primary sequence of BHMT to match that of BHMT-2, resulted in a protein that did not express well in E. coli (14Szegedi S.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), presumably due to a destablizing effect on its quaternary structure. It was subsequently determined that concentrating BHMT-2 and storing the enzyme in high concentrations of glycerol (40%, v/v) greatly stabilized its activity, thus allowing further study of its catalytic activity. The Hcy methylation capacities of BHMT and BHMT-2 were investigated using Bet, SMM, or AdoMet as methyl donors (Table 1). BHMT is active in the presence of Bet or SMM, with the enzyme consuming over 10-fold more Bet than SMM over the duration of 1 h. Surprisingly, BHMT-2 was unable to use Bet, but did have HMT activity with SMM. Although BHMT had no AdoMet-HMT activity, BHMT-2 exhibited some activity with this substrate. The initial rate kinetics of BHMT and BHMT-2 are shown in Table 2. The catalytic efficiency of BHMT toward Bet is 5-fold greater than for SMM, an effect predominantly mediated through kcat. The catalytic efficiency of BHMT-2 with SMM was 5-fold greater than the SMM-dependent activity of BHMT, which is primarily due to the lower Km BHMT-2 has for SMM.TABLE 1Methyl donor specificity of human BHMT and human BHMT-2EnzymeBetaFor Bet-Hcy and AdoMet-Hcy methylation reactions, values are reported as nanomole of Met formed per h per mg of protein.

Open table in a new tab The substrate specificity was further evaluated by measuring the Bet- or SMM-dependent activities in the presence of various unlabeled methyl donors, products, and the bisubstrate BHMT inhibitor CBHcy (16Castro C. Gratson A.A. Evans J.C. Jiracek J. Collinsova M. Ludwig M.L. Garrow T.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5341-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Table 3). These compounds will either compete with or inhibit the generation of radiolabeled Met from radiolabeled Bet or SMM. The Bet-dependent activity of BHMT was not altered in the presence of 10-fold excess SMM, and the SMM-dependent activity of BHMT-2 was not changed in the presence of Bet. A 10-fold excess of AdoMet had no effect on BHMT activity, but reduced the SMM-methylation capacity of BHMT-2 by 24%. AdoHcy had no effect on the activity of either protein. DMG, the product of the Bet-mediated methylation of BHMT, at 10-fold excess obliterated apparent BHMT activity but only reduced BHMT-2 activity by 11%. A 10-fold excess of Met, the product of both BHMT and BHMT-2 reactions, reduced apparent BHMT activity by 11% and apparent BHMT-2 activity by 60%. Fifty μm CBHcy eliminated BHMT activity, whereas 500 μm CBHcy only inhibited BHMT-2 activity by 26%. A 10-fold excess of DMSA reduced the apparent BHMT activity by 79% and BHMT-2 activity by 20%. A 10-fold excess of DMSP reduced the apparent BHMT activity by 8% and BHMT-2 activity by 29%. Combined, these results clearly indicate that BHMT and BHMT-2 have functional differences in their methyl donor binding sites.TABLE 3Inhibition of human BHMT and human BHMT-2 activities (relative) by methyl donor substrates, products, and CBHcyLigand[Ligand]BHMTBHMT-2mmEnzyme alone100100Bet0.21022.0101SMM0.2972.097AdoMet0.2100992.09676DMSA0.271932.02180DMSP0.298902.09271DMG0.220982.0389Met0.298832.08540AdoHcy0.29797CBHcy0.053990.50074 Open table in a new tab Characterization of Bet- and SMM-Hcy Methylation Activities in Mouse Tissue Extracts—CBHcy was used to develop an assay that could distinguish between Bet- and SMM-dependent Hcy methylation activities in mouse liver extracts. The assumption was made that, like the human enzymes, the Bet- and SMM-dependent methylation activities of mouse BHMT would be completely inhibited by CBHcy but have little affect on the SMM-dependent activity of BHMT-2. Consistent with this assumption, low concentrations of CBHcy abolished the Bet-dependent activity in mouse liver extract, whereas most of the SMM-dependent activity remained (Table 4). Furthermore, in the presence of CBHcy the Km for mouse BHMT-2 (0.76 mm) in mouse liver was in good agreement with that of purified human BHMT-2 (0.94 mm) (Table 2). An apparent inhibition study was also done on Bet- and SMM-mediated methylation activity in mouse liver extracts. The apparent inhibition patterns of the Bet-Hcy methylation activity of BHMT and the SMM-Hcy methylation activity of BHMT-2 in mouse liver are very similar to the results obtained for human BHMT and BHMT-2 (Table 5 versus Table 3). The BHMT activity in mouse liver was 21-fold greater than that of BHMT-2, whereas these enzyme activities were much lower in the kidney and were present in approximately equal amounts (Table 6). No BHMT-2 activity was detected in the heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, brain, small intestine, or lung (data not shown).TABLE 4Dose-dependent inhibition (relative) of Bet- and SMM-dependent Hcy methyltransferase activities by CBHcy in mouse liver extractBet-dependentSMM-dependentEnzyme alone100100CBHcy (μm) 251.378 62.50.3564 1250.1851 2500.0634 500019 Open table in a new tab TABLE 5Inhibition of mouse liver BHMT and BHMT-2 activities (relative) by methyl donor substrates and productsLigand[Ligand]BHMTBHMT-2μmEnzyme alone100100Bet0.251022.596SMM0.25972.596AdoMet0.2597972.59585DMSA0.2571992.51894DMSP0.2597982.58983DMG0.2536972.5581Met0.2598912.56252 Open table in a new tab TABLE 6BHMT and BHMT-2 activities in mouse liver and kidneyProteinActivityBHMT/BHMT-2 ratioaBHMT-2 assays were done in the presence of 62.5 μm CBHcy.

Open table in a new tab This report represents the first characterization of enzyme activity associated with BHMT-2. Hitherto, reports on BHMT-2 were restricted to an examination of the expression of human and mouse genes (8Chadwick L.H. McCandless S.E. Silverman G.L. Schwartz S. Westaway D. Nadeau J.H.

Castro C. Garrow T.A. Yiotakis A. Dive V. Jiracek J. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have shown that human BHMT-2 is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes Hcy methylation. Despite the sequence similarity between BHMT and BHMT-2, no Bet-dependent activity of BHMT-2 could be detected. Rather, BHMT-2 has substantial SMM-HMT activity, and to a lesser extent, AdoMet-HMT activity (Table 1). The lack of inhibition of the SMM-HMT activity of BHMT-2 by Bet and DMG (Tables 3 and 5) supports the conclusion that BHMT-2 does not use Bet to methylate Hcy. We have also determined that BHMT performs SMM-mediated Hcy methylation in vitro. However, the ability of BHMT to use this substrate in vivo is doubtful because SMM did not inhibit BHMT activity when the enzyme was presented with a concentration of SMM that was 10-fold greater than Bet (Tables 3 and 5), the latter of which was well below the Km (19Millian N.S. Garrow T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Nakajima K. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 2006; 52: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) for this substrate. Bet concentrations in mouse and rat liver are about 500 nmol/g wet weight of organ (21Koc H. Mar M.H. Ranasinghe A. Swenberg J.A. Zeisel S.H. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4734-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The SMM concentration in liver is not known and presumably varies depending upon dietary SMM and feeding-fasting cycles, but it is probably reasonable to assume its concentration never exceeds hepatic Bet concentrations unless supplemented. Future work needs to measure SMM in liver and plasma to confirm its potential as a physiological substrate for BHMT-2. Combined, our in vitro data suggest that BHMT can be ascribed all the Bet-dependent activity in vivo, whereas BHMT-2 can most likely be ascribed to all of the SMM-dependent activity. A previous report indicated that AdoMet does not inhibit BHMT activity (22Bose N. Greenspan P. Momany C. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which we have verified. Furthermore, Bose et al. (22Bose N. Greenspan P. Momany C. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) could not detect any binding of AdoMet to BHMT using microcalorimetry. In contrast, BHMT-2 displayed low activity using AdoMet as a methyl donor and AdoMet also inhibited the SMM-Hcy methylation activity of BHMT-2. The utilization of BHMT-2 for AdoMet is not surprising because it has a preference for SMM and many Pfam 02574 members, including AtHMT-1 and 2 (23Ranocha P. Bourgis F. Ziemak M.J. Rhodes D.

We have also found that germination of spores of other fungi, notably those of Myrothecium verrucaria, is inhibited, so that a more satisfactory assay can be developed. Greatest activity develops in cultures on Czapek–Dox medium containing 10–15 per cent sucrose ; sucrose is appreciably superior to glucose or other sugars. From such culture filtrates, using a strain of Alternaria solani (No. 408 in our collection), we have isolated a material, for which we propose the name alternaric acid, which appears to be responsible for both the antifungal effects mentioned above."

Further analysis revealed that GITR activation suppressed NK cell proliferation in response to IL-15. GITR activation also suppressed proinflammatory cytokine secretion and increased NK cell apoptosis. GITR activation resulted in blocked phosphorylation of Stat5 and Akt, which may have contributed to the observed antiproliferative effect of GITR on NK cells. Increased apoptosis was independent of the Fas-FasL pathway, but Bcl-XL and phospho-Bad protein expressions were diminished, suggesting involvement of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The results suggest that although GITR is an activation marker for NK cells similar to that for T cells, GITR serves as a negative regulator for NK cell activation. Our studies demonstrate a novel physiological role of GITR on NK cells."

Our laboratory demonstrated that the actin-binding protein profilin-1 (Pfn) plays a role in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Pfn is a well characterized regulator of cytoskeletal architecture because of its multifaceted function in actin filament assembly (10Kang F. Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36963-36972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and depolymerization (11Didry D. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Of note, little is known regarding the transcriptional regulation of Pfn in mammalian cells either constitutively or in response to factors promoting vascular disease. We showed previously that Pfn protein levels were increased in the diabetic endothelium and within atherosclerotic plaques (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Also attenuation of Pfn levels protected against atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction upon high fat feeding (13Romeo G.R. Moulton K.S. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally 7-ketocholesterol (oxysterol), but not high glucose concentrations, elevated Pfn expression in EC in part via transcriptional mechanisms (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Collectively these studies suggest that Pfn levels are regulated by oxidized lipids and contribute to vascular injury associated to diabetes and a high fat diet. Oxysterols are naturally occurring oxygenated products of cholesterol that play a major role in cholesterol homeostasis (14Massey J.B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2006; 17: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and are enriched in foam cells and atherosclerotic plaques (15Brown A.J. Leong S.L. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1730-1745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to interacting and regulating the activity of members of the liver X receptor family of transcription factors (for a review, see Ref. 16Zelcer N. Tontonoz P. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), oxysterols bind with varying affinity to the cytosolic protein oxysterol-binding protein-1 (OSBP1), which was first identified by Taylor et al. (17Taylor F.R. Saucier S.E. Shown E.P. Parish E.J. Kandutsch A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12382-12387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a growing list of OSBP1-related proteins (18Olkkonen V.M. Levine T.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Oxysterol binding to the sterol-binding domain of OSBP1 elicits its translocation and tethering to the Golgi, which is mediated by the PH domain located in the N-terminal region of the protein (19Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recently OSBP1 was identified as an essential component of a multiprotein complex that regulates p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in response to cholesterol and oxysterol (20Wang P.Y. Weng J. Anderson R.G. Science. 2005; 307: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), thus defining an unexpected role for OSBP1 as a scaffolding for the assembly of signaling modules. Based on our previous findings, we reasoned that elucidating the mechanisms for oxysterol- and diabetes-dependent up-regulation of Pfn would shed new light on the pathophysiology of vascular injury associated with the metabolic syndrome. Here we show that OSBP1 is required for oxysterol-dependent nucleation and activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which in turn regulates Pfn gene expression in EC. Similarly diabetes increases the activation of STAT3 and its recruitment to the Pfn promoter in large vessels in vivo. Reagents—7-Ketocholesterol (hereafter, oxysterol) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (Steraloids, Inc.) were the oxidized cholesterol derivatives used for cell stimulation. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified. Cells—Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) were isolated and cultured as described previously (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stimulation with oxysterols was performed at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml (∼25 μm) in ethanol. Cell viability (trypan blue exclusion test) and apoptosis, assessed by photometric detection of mono- and oligonucleosomes (Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS, Roche Applied Science), were comparable in untreated and oxysterol-treated cells over the short stimulation periods of our experiments. Stimulation with rat recombinant IL-6 (50 ng/ml; R&D Systems) and rat recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was performed after overnight culture in medium with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Animals and Organ Isolation—Induction of diabetes by streptozotocin (55 mg/kg of body weight intravenously) in 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley male rats, insulin treatment, and procedures for perfusion and aorta isolation were described previously (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Glycohemoglobin was measured (Glyc-Affin, Pierce) before sacrifice to assess the degree of hyperglycemia (14.1 ± 1.6% in diabetic versus 4.4 ± 0.3% in control rats). After isolation, the aorta was either used for extraction of protein lysates from the endothelium (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or for chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in RAEC and Rat Aorta—In RAEC (1.5 × 107 cells per condition), ChIP assays were performed as described in the manufacturer's manual (Upstate) with several modifications. After stimulation, medium was added with formaldehyde to a 1% final concentration for 5, 7.5, or 10 min. Fixation for 5 min greatly enhanced the efficiency of the subsequent STAT3 and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) immunoprecipitation procedure. Following addition of glycine (125 mm) for 5 min at room temperature and three washes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μm), pepstatin (1 μm), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) were added to buffers throughout the procedure. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), rotated for 10 min at 4 °C, briefly vortexed, and subjected to 20 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer pestle B. After centrifugation (1,000 × g for 5 min), the supernatant was discarded, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). Sonication was then performed on ice (four cycles of 10-s pulses interspersed by a 30-s pause, constant setting, ¼ of maximum power in a Branson Sonifier 450) to yield DNA fragments of ∼0.3–1.0-kb size. After centrifugation at maximum speed for 15 min in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was diluted 20 times with ChIP dilution buffer (1.0% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 167 mm NaCl) and used for immunoprecipitation. A 2% aliquot was saved to quantify the starting material (“input”). Samples were precleared for 3 h at 4°C using the respective non-immune IgG and either Protein A- or Protein G-agarose beads coupled with salmon sperm. The conditions and washing buffers for immunoprecipitation varied according to the antibody as indicated in Table 1. Following immunoprecipitation, the chromatin-protein-antibody complex was eluted from the beads by three 10-min incubations with 150 μl of freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). DNase-free RNase (Roche Applied Science) was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation at 65 °C for 6–8 h to reverse cross-linking. Finally DNA-complexed proteins were digested for 2 h at 45°C with nickase-, endonuclease-free proteinase K (Sigma; 100 μg/ml in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) and 10 mm EDTA). After DNA extraction by standard procedures, the pfn promoter regions were amplified by PCR using the primers Forward (–1025 to –999) (5′-TGA GTC CCG TCT TGT CAC CCG GCT GGC-3′) and Reverse (–410 to –436) (5′-ACC ACT TTG CCG CAG AAG GAG GAA ACC-3′), yielding a 616-bp fragment. The ChIP assay in the aorta was optimized using several modifications of the procedure in cells. Anesthetized control and diabetic rats were perfused first with phosphate-buffered saline (3 min) and then with 1% formaldehyde (2 min). The whole descending aorta was dissected and cleaned from periadventitial tissue. Samples were carefully minced, fixed again for 5 min, and subjected to 20 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer pestle B. Tissue fragments were lysed in nuclear lysis buffer followed by sonication (five cycles of 10-s pulses interspersed by a 60-s pause, constant setting, ½ of maximum power in a Branson Sonifier 450). Samples from 7–10 rats were pooled for each ChIP assay.TABLE 1Primary antibodies and conditions used in ChIP assaysProteinSource, reference no.SpeciesWashing buffers (n times)Acetyl-H3 (Lys-9/14)Upstate, 06-599RabbitLS-I (2), HS-I (2), LiCl (1)Acetyl-H3 (Lys-9)Cell Signaling, 9671RabbitLS-I (2), HS-I (2), LiCl (1)STAT3Upstate, 06-596RabbitLS-II (2), HS-II (2), LiCl (1)STAT3Santa Cruz, sc-482RabbitSRC1Santa Cruz, sc-6096GoatLS-II (2), HS-II (2), LiCl (1)CBPSanta Cruz, sc-369RabbitLS-II (2), HS-II (2), LiCl (1)CBPUpstate, 06-294RabbitpCAFUpstate, 07-141RabbitLS-II (2), HS-II (2)BRG1Upstate, 07-478RabbitLS-II (2), HS-II (2)HDAC3Upstate, 06-890RabbitLS-II (2), HS-II (2), LiCl (1) Open table in a new tab Nuclear Extracts—Cell fractionation was carried out using 1.5–2.0 × 107 RAEC. After washes with ice-cold STE (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and ST (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl), cells were harvested in ice-cold ST supplemented with 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation and a short wash in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), hypotonic lysis was performed in Buffer A for 15 min on ice followed by 30 strokes with a prechilled Dounce homogenizer pestle B. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min; the supernatant was used as “cytosolic” extract. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and then 200 μl of high salt Buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.8 m KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) were added dropwise, ensuring thorough resuspension of nuclei. Following five strokes with a Dounce homogenizer, extracts were gently rotated for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, the resulting supernatant was used as the “nuclear” extract. For immunoprecipitation, nuclear extracts were diluted 4 times in low salt buffer yielding a ∼100 mm KCl final concentration. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—For total cell lysate extracts, RAEC were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and processed for immunoprecipitation or immunoblot analysis as described previously (12Romeo G.

Immunoprecipitation for endogenous OSBP1 (goat polyclonal antibody, Novus Biologicals) in rat aorta was performed using 1 mg of lysates extracted from the endothelium of combined thoracic and abdominal aorta (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All other immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using 0.5 mg of total RAEC or thoracic aorta lysates. Immunoprecipitation was performed after preclearing with the respective non-immune IgG and Protein G- or Protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). A list of antibodies used for immunoblot and the apparent molecular weight of the detected bands is reported in Table 2.

Wang, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) and cloned into StuI sites of the retroviral vector pLNCX2 (Clontech). The cDNA coding for pLNCX2-OSBP1-myc-his mutant Y394F was constructed using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The forward primer for this construct was 5′-GCC TTG ATG AAC AGT TTA AGC ATC AGC TGG AGG AGA CC-3′, corresponding to positions 1246–1283 of GenBank™accession number J05056 (the site of Tyr-394 mutated to Phe is underlined). All cDNAs were verified by sequencing. After transfection of pLNCX2-OSBP1 constructs and empty vector into 293GPG cells (21Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), the virus-containing supernatant was collected, concentrated (25,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C), and used to infect RAEC as described previously (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Following selection with G418 (1 mg/ml), expression of OSBP1 plasmids was detected using anti c-MYC antibody (9E10), whereas total levels were monitored with goat polyclonal anti-OSBP1 (Novus Biologicals). With regard to STAT3 expression, RAEC were transiently transfected with the rat STAT3 expression vector (ATCC number 63359) or the pSVSport-1 empty vector using a combination of FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). Short hairpin (sh) RNA—Knockdown of OSBP1 was achieved using the two oligos described previously by Wang et al. (20Wang P.Y. Weng J. Anderson R.G. Science. 2005; 307: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) that were engineered and cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ (Clontech BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RAEC were infected with virus, obtained as above, coding for the shRNA target sequences or pSIREN empty vector and selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml). Luciferase Reporter Assay—A PCR-based method was used to serially clone fragments of the 5′-region of the rat pfn gene upstream of the transcription initiation site into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Genomic DNA from RAEC was used as a template for cloning. pGL3 constructs were named according to the size of the inserted promoter region (Table 3). The 5′-end of PCR forward primers included a KpnI site, and the 5′-end of the common reverse primer included a HindIII site to allow for rapid cloning into the KpnI-HindIII sites of pGL3 vector. The STAT-binding site at –501 was mutated from 5′-TTCCCGGAA-3′ to 5′-TgCCCGGcc-3′ in the context of the pGL3(–717) construct using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All cDNAs were verified by sequencing. Reporter construct DNA (0.9 μg) was transfected in RAEC cultured in 6-well plates using a combination of FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) and PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). pSV-β-galactosidase (0.1 μg; Promega) was co-transfected as a control for transfection efficiency and harvesting. Following transfection, cells were returned to regular medium for 20 h. After 4-h stimulation with oxysterol as described previously (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using a Dynatech ML 2010 luminometer and for galactosidase activity in a spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative light units.TABLE 3Primers for cloning of Pfn 5′-untranslated region fragments into pGL3-BasicPrimer positionsSequenceForward -222 to -2025′-CCTGGTACCGGG AGC AGG CCC CGC CCC GCC-3′ -401 to -3805′-CCTGGTACCCCG TAC GAA TTG GAG CGA GCC C-3′ -717 to -6965′-CCTGGTACCCCT GCT GGG GAC GCG TCT TCC C-3′ -945 to -9255′-CCTGGTACCAGC TGG AGC GGA TCC AGC GAA-3′ -1500 to -14805′-CCTGGTACCCGC AGA TCA GAG GTC AAG GGA-3′Reverse +59 to +395′-CCAAAGCTTCGT CCT GAC AGG TCC CGT CC-3′ Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Comparisons between two groups were performed using unpaired t test. Comparisons for multiple groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Oxysterol Regulates pfn Promoter Activity via STAT-binding Site—Because 7-ketocholesterol (oxysterol) increases Pfn levels at least in part by transcriptional mechanisms (12Romeo G. Frangioni J.V. Kazlauskas A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), its effects on promoter activity of serial fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the rat pfn gene were assessed using a luciferase reporter assay. pfn promoter constructs were transfected in RAEC along with pSV-β-galactosidase as an internal control for the procedure. Luciferase reporter activity of fragments downstream of nucleotide –401, relative to the transcription initiation site, was not influenced by oxysterol (10 μg/ml; Fig. 1A). Conversely promoter activity of the fragment spanning from +59 to –717 was significantly increased in oxysterol-treated RAEC when compared with control cells (13.6 ± 1.29-versus 6.6 ± 0.33-fold over pGL3-Basic after normalization for β-galactosidase activity; p < 0.0005). Software-assisted analysis (MatInspector, Genomatix) of transcription factor response elements within this fragment revealed a single potential STAT-binding site, TTN5AA (23Seidel H.M. Milocco P. Lamb J.E. Darnell J.E.J. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), starting at nucleotide –501. Notably site-directed mutagenesis of this consensus sequence largely abrogated response of the +59/–717 fragment to oxysterol. Promoter activity of this fragment was further elevated by co-transfection with a rat STAT3 expression vector (Fig. 1B), which resulted in a ∼3-fold increase in total STAT3 protein levels accompanied by a modest increase in unstimulated STAT3 activation (data not shown). The effects of STAT3 overexpression were observed only in oxysterol-stimulated RAEC, thus suggesting that elevating STAT3 levels alone was not sufficient to influence pfn promoter activity. Furthermore forced expression of STAT3 did not modify promoter activity of the mutated +59/–717 fragment. Although 7-ketocholesterol was the primary type of oxidized cholesterol used for these experiments, exposure to 25-hydroxycholesterol (1 μg/ml) resulted in a comparable profile of promoter activity with values ∼20% higher than those resulting from treatment with 7-ketocholesterol (data not shown). Finally preincubation with synthetic agonists for the oxysterol-regulated liver X receptor family of transcription factors, T0901317 (16Zelcer N. Tontonoz P. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) and GW3965 (22Collins J.L. Fivush A.M. Watson M.A. Galardi C.M. Lewis M.C. Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Wilson J.G. Tippin T.K. Binz J.G. Plunket K.D. Morgan D.G. Beaudet E.J. Whitney K.D. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) both used at 5 μm final concentration, did not affect luciferase activity of pfn constructs (data not shown) in keeping with their lack of liver X receptor response elements (24Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Together these studies indicated that oxysterol positively regulated pfn promoter activity, within the proximal 1.5-kb sequence of the 5′-flanking region, via a single STAT-binding site located at nucleotide –501. Although other transcription factors may play a critical role in basal transcriptional activity, we investigated the mechanisms for STAT activation and its function in Pfn regulation in response to oxysterol and to diabetes in vivo. Diabetes and Oxysterol Activate STAT3 in EC—STATs are transcription factor that reside in the cytoplasm in a latent form and become activated by phosphorylation in response to a plethora of extracellular ligands (25Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1997; 270: 1630-1635Crossref Scopus (3401) Google Scholar), thus controlling processes such as inflammation and innate immunity (26Shuai K. Luai B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) that may play a role in endothelial dysfunction. Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of members of the STAT family were assessed upon oxysterol treatment and in diabetes. RAEC were exposed to oxysterol for increasing time periods with or without the JAK2/JAK3 inhibitor AG-490. STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705, indicative of activation, was increased starting at 15 min and then declined to the base line by 120 min (2.61 ± 0.2 at 15 min versus 1.1 ± 0.1 at 0 min; p < 0.0001; Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of JAK2 paralleled STAT3 phosphorylation. Moreover AG-490 substantially prevented the activation of STAT3 without affecting STAT3 or JAK2 total levels, strongly suggesting an essential role for JAK2 in oxysterol-meditated STAT3 activation. Treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol resulted in a similar pattern of STAT3 activation (data not shown). Following tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT dimerization takes place through the reciprocal interaction of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain with phosphotyrosine-binding domain to create either homoor heterodimers, thus leading to STAT translocation to the nucleus and regulation of target genes (27Levy D.E. Darnell J.E.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus"
https://openalex.org/W2043193854,"Here we investigate the effects of a myopathy-causing mutation in αB-crystallin, Q151X, upon its structure and function. This mutation removes the C-terminal domain of αB-crystallin, which is expected to compromise both its oligomerization and chaperone activity. We compared this to two other αB-crystallin mutants (450delA, 464delCT) and also to a series of C-terminal truncations (E164X, E165X, K174X, and A171X). We find that the effects of the Q151X mutation were not always as predicted. Specifically, we have found that although the Q151X mutation decreased oligomerization of αB-crystallin and even increased some chaperone activities, it also significantly destabilized αB-crystallin causing it to self-aggregate. This conclusion was supported by our analyses of both the other disease-causing mutants and the series of C-terminal truncation constructs of αB-crystallin. The 450delA and 464delCT mutants could only be refolded and assayed as a complex with wild type αB-crystallin, which was not the case for Q151X αB-crystallin. From these studies, we conclude that all three disease-causing mutations (450delA, 464delCT, and Q151X) in the C-terminal extension destabilize αB-crystallin and increase its tendency to self-aggregate. We propose that it is this, rather than a catastrophic loss of chaperone activity, which is a major factor in the development of the reported diseases for the three disease-causing mutations studied here. In support of this hypothesis, we show that Q151X αB-crystallin is found mainly in the insoluble fraction of cell extracts from transient transfected cells, due to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates.

In support of this hypothesis, we show that Q151X αB-crystallin is found mainly in the insoluble fraction of cell extracts from transient transfected cells, due to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates. The crystallins were first identified as the major proteins of the eye lens and their subsequent classification into α-, β-, and γ-crystallins (1Morner C. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1894; 18: 61-106Google Scholar) allowed different functional properties to be assigned to the α- and βγ-crystallin groups (2Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 41: 259-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The α-crystallins are two distinct proteins derived from two separate genes, αA- and αB-crystallin (2Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 41: 259-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Whereas αA-crystallin is almost entirely lens specific (3Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Goto S. Inaguma Y. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), αB-crystallin is expressed widely in other tissues, most notably astrocytes (4Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K. Goldman J.E. Kidney Int. 1991; 40: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and muscle (5Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the early 1980s, pioneering work from Klemenz and co-workers (6Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R.

A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar) laboratories established that αB-crystallin was a protein chaperone and a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) 2The abbreviations used are: sHSP, small heat shock protein; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid; MWCO, molecular weight cut off; SEC, size exclusion chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: sHSP, small heat shock protein; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid; MWCO, molecular weight cut off; SEC, size exclusion chromatography. family, that is now known to comprise 10 different human proteins (8Kappe G. Verschuure P. Philipsen R.L. Staalduinen A.A. Van de Boogaart P. Boelens W.C. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1520: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When the first mutation (R120G) in αB-crystallin was reported, it was found to cause both cataract and desmin-related myopathy in the affected patients (9Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Characteristic histopathological aggregates of the muscle intermediate filament protein desmin were observed (9Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that there is an important functional interaction between intermediate filaments and αB-crystallin. Subsequent analyses showed that the R120G αB-crystallin mutation induced increased binding for desmin intermediate filaments (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), providing an explanation for the formation of the desmin aggregates in the muscles of the affected individuals. Coincidentally, mutations in desmin also induced filament aggregation (11Goldfarb L.G. Park K.Y. Cervenakova L. Gorokhova S. Lee H.S. Vasconcelos O. Nagle J.W. Semino-Mora C. Sivakumar K. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 402-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12Schroder R. Vrabie A. Goebel H.H. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2007; 11: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and these aggregates also contained αB-crystallin (12Schroder R. Vrabie A. Goebel H.H. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2007; 11: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that one of the functions of αB-crystallin is to chaperone intermediate filaments and their networks in cells (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, three other mutations in the C-terminal extension were reported for αB-crystallin, but in contrast to the R120G mutation, none caused both cataract and myopathy. The first of these was the 450delA mutation that is associated only with cataract and resulted in a 184-residue product where the coding sequence of the C-terminal extension was altered from residue 150 onwards (15Berry V. Francis P. Reddy M.A. Collyer D. Vithana E. MacKay I. Dawson G. Carey A.H. Moore A. Bhattacharya S.S. Quinlan R.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1141-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This region is distal to the β-strand 9 and proximal to the conserved hydrophobic IX(I/V) motif (16de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) that forms part of β-strand 10 in the crystal structure of the archaeal HSP16.5 (17Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Two other mutations were then reported (Q151X and 464delCT) that cause myopathy and not cataract (18Selcen D. Engel A.G. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) that either truncated (Q151X) or substituted the C-terminal extension from residue 155 (464delCT). The fact that all three mutations delete a known substrate interaction site (157–164) (19Ghosh J.G. Estrada M.R. Clark J.I. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14854-14869Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and a region important in the oligomerization of αB-crystallin itself (155–166) (20Ghosh J.G. Clark J.I. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 684-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) support the hypothesis that this region in αB-crystallin is important to both the structure and function of the protein. Very recently, a C-terminal point mutation (R157H) (21Inagaki N. Hayashi T. Arimura T. Koga Y. Takahashi M. Shibata H. Teraoka K. Chikamori T. Yamashina A. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was reported, lending further support to this conclusion. Thus far, the effect of such extensive deletions (Q151X) combined with altered C-terminal sequences (450delA and 464CT) upon αB-crystallin structure and function have not been investigated. In other sHSPs, the C-terminal domain has been shown to be very important to both oligomerization and chaperone function and therefore the expectation is that the C-terminal extension mutations would similarly affect αB-crystallin. Removal of the 17 most C-terminal residues of αA-crystallin reduced its chaperone activity and induced the formation of larger oligomers (22Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In two crystal structures of sHSPs (HSP16.5 (17Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and HSP16.9 (23van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar)), the C-terminal extension makes contact with a hydrophobic patch on neighboring protein subunits, strengthening the dimer-dimer interaction in the oligomer (23van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The sequence between β-strands 9 and 10 of the C-terminal extension contains a hinge that likely contributes to the size polydispersity of the different sHSPs by allowing packing geometries to vary while maintaining common interaction surfaces (23van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Some naturally occurring sHSPs lack a C-terminal extension and in such cases the oligomerization is restricted, as seen for Tsp36 from the tapeworm Taenia saginata, which forms dimers and tetramers, but is functional as a chaperone (24Stamler R. Kappe G. Boelens W. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Likewise, removal of the short C-terminal extension from Methanococcus janaschii HSP16.5 resulted in reduced oligomerization, but the retention of chaperone activity (25Kim R. Lai L. Lee H.H. Cheong G.W. Kim K.K. Wu Z. Yokota H. Marqusee S. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8151-8155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is quite contrary to the closely related lens chaperone αA-crystallin that naturally co-oligomerizes with αB-crystallin in the lens. Stepwise removal of C-terminal sequences from αA-crystallin, including the REEK motif, not only reduced oligomerization, but also resulted in the sequential loss of chaperone activity (26Rajan S. Chandrashekar R. Aziz A. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15684-15691Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), despite the fact that the IX(I/V) motif was retained in the mutants investigated. Mutations of lysine and glutamic acid residues in the C-terminal extension can improve chaperone activity against amyloid fibril formation providing a potential application of αB-crystallin in the treatment of amyloid-related diseases (27Treweek T.M.

In αB-crystallin, there has not been any systematic analysis of the role of the C-terminal extension and therefore no potential explanation of whether the three mutations (450delA, Q151X, and 464delCT) cause the various diseases via the loss of chaperone function or perhaps by a different mechanism. In this study, we have analyzed the effects of the Q151X, 464delCT, and 450delA upon the oligomerization and chaperone activity of αB-crystallin. For comparison, we have also assessed the activity of a series of αB-crystallin constructs truncated at residues Lys174, Ala171, Glu165, and Glu164 to sequentially remove important regions of the C-terminal extension and therefore help us understand the effect of the Q151X mutation. With respect to the role of the C-terminal extension in oligomerization, our data show similar results to those obtained for αA-crystallin (28Thampi P. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11857-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the chaperone function of Q151X is actually increased in some in vitro chaperone assays. The ability of Q151X αB-crystallin to resist self-aggregation is, however, very greatly diminished, a trend that is further enhanced by the 464delCT and 450delA mutations, which are only stable in the presence of wild type αB-crystallin. These data show that like other sHSPs, the C-terminal extension is important for oligomerization. Its removal increases the tendency of αB-crystallin to self-aggregate. Primers (Table 1; Sigma Genosys, UK) were designed based on the mRNA sequence for wild type human αB-crystallin (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank entry NM_001885) and were used to generate the mutants listed, using wild type αB-crystallin as a template for PCR mutagenesis. With the exception of the Q151X and E165X mutations, the amplified products were cloned into the vector pGEM®-T Easy (Promega). After verification of the sequences, the mutant αB-crystallin constructs were subcloned into the NcoI and EcoRI sites of the expression vector pET23d (Invitrogen). The Q151X and E165X mutations were introduced into pET23d by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using complementary primers (see Table 1). Constructs were sequenced and compared for fidelity to the GenBank™ data base (accession number NM001885).TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primer sequence details used for introduction of the αB-crystallin mutationsMutant αB-crystallinRestriction enzyme sitePrimer sequence (5′-3′)Q151XStuIForward primer:gtgaatggaccaaggaaataggcctctggccctgagcgcaccReverse primer:ggtgcgctcagggccagaggcctatttccttggtccattcacE165XHindIIIForward primer:attcccatcacccgtgaatagaagcttgctgtcaccgcagcccccReverse primer:gggggctgcggtgacagcaagcttctattcacgggtgatgggaat464delCTNAaNA, not applicable.Forward primer:taccatggacatcgccatccaccaccReverse primer:tcacgggtgatgggaatggtgcgctcggccagagacctgtttccK174XSacIIForward primer:taccatggacatcgccatccaccaccReverse primer:ctagggggccgcggtgacagcaggcttcA171XSacIForward primer:taccatggacatcgccatccaccaccReverse primer:gggcatctatttcttgggagctcaggtgacagcaggcttctcE164XPstIForward primer:taccatggacatcgccatccaccaccReverse primer:cttgggagctgcggtgactgcaggcttctcttaacgggtgatgggaatggta NA, not applicable.

Peak fractions were pooled and then dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, in preparation for size exclusion chromatography on a Fractogel EMD BioSEC Superformance column (60 × 1.6 cm; VWR, UK). All other mutant αB-crystallins formed inclusion bodies, and were purified essentially as described (31Quinlan R.A. Moir R.D. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 71-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol and then purified by ion exchange chromatography (29Perng M.D. Muchowski P.J. van den IJssel P.

Fractions containing αB-crystallin were pooled and sometimes concentrated using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filter device 10K MWCO (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Concentrations of the purified proteins were determined using BCA Protein Assay reagent kit (Pierce) unless otherwise stated. The 450delA, 464delCT, and Q151X were refolded in the presence of wild type αB-crystallin. Wild type αB-crystallin was dialyzed for 16 h at 4 °C into 10 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Protein concentration of the wild type and mutant αB-crystallin were determined by OD280 (extinction coefficients were determined using the Emboss Pepstats program) and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio. The protein mixture was diluted to 0.25 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol followed by an additional 6-fold dilution to 1 m urea in refold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) prior to dialysis against the same buffer for 4 h at 16 °C. The dialysate was partially concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filter device 10K MWCO (Millipore) and centrifuged for 2 h at 4°C at 250,000 × g in the Beckman Optima MAX Ultracentrifuge MLA-80 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA). The supernatant was further concentrated to a suitable volume. The protein mixture was dialyzed into refold buffer for 4 h at 16 °C. The dialysate was centrifuged for 2 h at 4 °C at 250,000 × g in the Beckman Optima MAX Ultracentrifuge MLA-80 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc.) and the supernatant concentrated to give the desired protein concentration. Purified αB-crystallin proteins were analyzed using a Superose 6 column (290 × 10 mm) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at room temperature using a Merck-Hitachi Biochromatography system. The data were analyzed using Chromeleon 6.30 software (Sunnyvale, CA). Purified proteins were loaded onto a MassPREP desalting cartridge (Waters, Elstree, Herts, UK) to remove buffer contaminants. The protein was eluted with 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.5% (v/v) formic acid at 0.2 ml/min and introduced into a Waters Q-TOF Premier mass spectrometer operating in positive electrospray mode, with a cone voltage of 40 V. Spectra were externally calibrated using sodium formate, then corrected for drift using a leucine enkephalin lockspray. Multiply charged protein ions were deconvoluted using the manufacturer-supplied MaxEnt1 software, to determine protein mass. Far UV CD spectra of wild type and mutant αB-crystallin were recorded in a cuvette with 0.1-cm path length at room temperature using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Samples were at a concentration of 0.2–0.3 mg/ml, with the exception of Q151X, assayed at 0.1 mg/ml due to the low yield of soluble protein. Samples were assayed in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5. Four data sets were collected for each sample and averaged, by continuous scanning at 100 nm/min, between wavelengths 190 and 250 nm. The UV CD spectra were baseline corrected using spectra of the buffer. The CD spectra were normalized and expressed as molar ellipticity. Absorbance at 360 nm over a temperature gradient of 25–86 °C at 1 °C/min ramp rate was continuously monitored using the Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Samples were assayed at 0.1 mg/ml. Citrate Synthase—A 200-μl volume of citrate synthase from porcine heart (Sigma) was dialyzed for 16 h at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and diluted to 0.49 mg/ml. The assay mixture contained citrate synthase and αB-crystallin at a 4:1 ratio of substrate:chaperone in 220 μl. Time-dependant light scattering was measured at 360 nm every 15 s over 30 min at 42 °C using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Insulin Assay—A 20-mg aliquot of insulin from bovine pancreas (Sigma) was reconstituted in 100 mm NaSO4, 20 mm NaPO4, pH 6.9 (Insulin buffer), and solubilized by the addition of 30% (v/v) acetic acid and gentle mixing for 15 min. The insulin solution was dialyzed for 16 h at 4 °C against the insulin buffer and the dialysate was centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 × g in an Eppendorf bench top centrifuge (5417R; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The insulin concentration was determined from the measured OD280 using its extinction coefficient ((A280/5840) × 5600 = mg/ml). Insulin was mixed with αB-crystallin at a 4:1 ratio and the change in light scattering was measured at 360 nm every 15 s over a period of 15 min at 37 °C using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. αB-Crystallin variant proteins were incubated in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of 1 μm and in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of bis-ANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid, purchased from Invitrogen). Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at room temperature prior to the acquisition of fluorescence spectra on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 410 nm and emission was collected between 420 and 700 nm with excitation and emission slit widths of 5 nm and a scan speed of 600 nm/min. All spectra are the average of 10 individual scans. In vitro assembly and cosedimentation assays were carried out essentially as described (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recombinant human desmin was a kind gift from Dr. Ming Der Perng (Durham, UK). Wild type or mutant αB-crystallin was mixed with desmin in low ionic strength buffer at a 1:1 mass ratio at 0.1 mg/ml. After filament assembly, samples were separated into pellet and supernatant fractions by high speed centrifugation (80,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA)) as described (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to pellet assembled desmin filament and the associated αB-crystallin. To investigate the ability of the three αB-crystallin mutants and the other C-terminal truncation constructs to prevent filament-filament interactions in vitro, an additional low-speed centrifugation assay was used (2500 × g for 15 min in a bench top centrifuge) as described previously (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) and protein bands visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The amount of protein in the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by a luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000plus; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) and quantified using the Image Gauge software (version 4.0; Fuji Film). MCF7 cells were maintained as described previously (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant αB-crystallin were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) from the bacterial expression vector pET23d, using XbaI and HindIII. Transient transfection of these cells was achieved using Gene-Juice transfection reagent (Novagen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before processing for immunofluorescence microscopy, cell fractionation, and immunoblotting. Cells grown on 10-cm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before being lysed with 1 ml of extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) by repeatedly passing through a 25-gauge needle. Following incubation on ice for 15 min, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were solubilized in equal volumes of Laemmli sample buffer before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis as described (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with a panel of purified mouse monoclonal anti-αB-crystallin 2D2B6 and monoclonal anti-HSP27 antibody, ER-D5, as described (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Antibody labeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a luminescent image analyzer (LAS-1000plus; Fuji Photo Film (UK), London, United Kingdom). Cells were processed as described previously (10Perng M.D. Wen S.F. van den IJssel P. Prescott A.R. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2335-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used in this study were rabbit polyclonal anti-αB-crystallin, a synthetic peptide corresponding to human αB-crystallin residues 1–10 (MDIAIHHPWI) conjugated to hemocyanin (1:200; Chemicon Ab1546) and monoclonal mouse anti-keratin LE41 (1:1; CRUK). Samples were analyzed using an Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images were obtained using a confocal Axiovert 200M microscope and LSM 510 META software (both Zeiss, Germany). Optical sections were set to ∼1.0 μm. Images were processed and prepared for figures using Adobe Photoshop 8.0 (Adobe Systems). Quantitation of the αB-crystallin phenotypes was by visual assessment of the cells. Expression and Purification of the C-terminal Extension αB-Crystallin Mutants—An overview of the C-terminal extension mutants in comparison to wild type αB-crystallin is presented (Fig. 1A). It shows the relationship of the various mutations and truncations to the structural features of the C-terminal extension and also summarizes the consequences of the two frameshift mutations, 450delA and 464delCT, that cause inherited cataract (15Berry V. Francis P. Reddy M.A. Collyer D. Vithana E. MacKay I. Dawson G. Carey A.H. Moore A. Bhattacharya S.S. Quinlan R.A. Am. J. Hum.

Neurol. 2003; 54: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), respectively. In addition to the three disease-causing mutations (Q151X, 450delA, and 464delCT), a series of C-terminal extension truncation constructs were also expressed and purified (Fig. 1B). All the mutants except A171X and K174X were purified from inclusion bodies. The predicted mass of each of the expressed proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry measurements (Fig. 1C). Whereas Q151X, E164X, and E165X could be refolded successfully without the addition of wild type αB-crystallin, both 450delA and 464delCT could only be refolded in its presence. When refolded with an equimolar ratio of αB-crystallin, ∼7% of 450delA and 10% of 464delCT remained soluble (Fig. 1D). Although Q151X αB-crystallin could be refolded in the absence of wild type αB-crystallin, the yield could be increased some 7-fold when the wild type protein was included. These data show the disease-causing mutations seriously affect the solubility of αB-crystallin. The K174X construct removes the two most C-terminal lysine residues and would be expected to retain the secondary structural characteristics and oligomerization characteristics of αB-crystallin (33Plater M.L. Goode D. Crabbe M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28558-28566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2059162950,"Evolution modulates the quantitative characteristics of protein interactions and often uses combinations of weak interactions to achieve a particular specificity. We addressed how quantitative optimization might be used in the design of multidomain proteins, using a chimera containing epidermal growth factor (EGF) as a cell targeting element and interferon-alpha-2a (IFNalpha-2a) to initiate signal transduction. We first connected EGF and IFNalpha-2a via a linker that allows both ligands to bind to their receptors on a cell surface and then incorporated a series of mutations into the IFNalpha-2a portion that progressively decrease both the on rate and the dissociation constant of the IFNalpha-2a-IFNalpha receptor 2 (IFNAR2) interaction. Using this strategy, we designed chimeric proteins in which the activation of the IFNalpha receptor in HeLa, A431, and engineered Daudi cells depends on the presence of EGF receptor on the same cell. The mutant chimeric proteins also inhibited proliferation of IFNalpha-sensitive cells in an EGF receptor-dependent manner. These results provide insights into the quantitative requirements for specific binding to multisubunit receptors and illustrate the value of a quantitative approach in the design of synthetic-biological constructs."

We detected a protein, distinct from MTF-1, specifically binding to the MREc region. DNA binding competition experiments using synthetic oligonucleotides and specific anti-NF1 antibodies showed that this protein binds to an NF1 site overlapping the MREc element as well as to a second site upstream of the Sp1a site and corresponds to NF1 or a related protein. Transfection experiments showed that loss of the two NF1 sites decreased metal-induced MT promoter activity by 55–70% in transiently transfected cells and almost completely abrogated metal and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) induction in stably transfected cells. Similarly, expression of an inactive NF1 protein strongly inhibited MT-1 promoter activity. Using synthetic promoters containing NF1 and MRE sites fused to a minimal MT promoter, we showed that these NF1 sites did not confer metal induction but enhanced metal-induced promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that NF1 binds to the mouse MT-1 promoter in vivo and showed that NF1 binding is zinc-inducible. In addition, zinc-induced NF1 DNA binding was MTF-1-dependent.

MTF-1 gene knock-out showed that MTF-1 is essential for basal and metal-induced MT gene transcription (22Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Notably, no MRE-binding protein could be detected in MTF-1 null mutant cells. This led to the hypothesis that MTF-1 is the only factor that binds MREs and the only transcription factor that mediates responsiveness to different metals. We previously identified and purified a mouse nuclear protein, termed metal element protein-1, specifically binding with high affinity to MRE elements in a zinc-dependent manner, and subsequently showed that this protein corresponds to MTF-1 thus supporting the contention that MTF-1 is the only MRE-binding factor (23Labbé S. Larouche L. Mailhot D. Séguin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that purified MTF-1 binds to MREc, MREd, and MREe, as assayed by DNaseI footprinting analysis (23Labbé S. Larouche L. Mailhot D. Séguin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). More recently, in a model depicting the dynamic transcription factor complexes found at the proximal region of the mouse MT-1 promoter, it has been suggested that MTF-1 occupies all MREs, including MREc, under metal-induced conditions (19Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6710-6721Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, on the basis of other experiments carried out in vitro and in vivo, it was suggested that NF1 interacts with the MREc element, as well as with two other sites in the MREb region, and inhibits both constitutive and metal-induced MT gene transcription (25Majumder S. Ghoshal K. Gronostajski R.M. Jacob S.T. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Jacob S.T. Majumder S. Ghoshal K. Environ. Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, earlier reports from the same laboratory had concluded that C/EBPδ (or CP-1) (27Aniskovitch L.P. Jacob S.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and CP-2 (28Aniskovitch L.P. Jacob S.T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) bind to the MREc region and activate MT transcription. In the course of our studies on the characterization of the mouse MT-1 gene promoter, DNaseI footprinting analyses revealed the presence of a nuclear protein, distinct from MTF-1, binding to the MREc region. Given that the identity of the MREc-binding protein remains controversial, we further analyzed this region. We show here that the MREc element overlaps with an atypical NF1 binding site and that a NF1-like protein binds in vitro to this region as well as to a second site contiguous with the Sp1a site. The NF1 protein contributes positively to the constitutive expression of the MT-1 gene and acts cooperatively with MTF-1 to activate MT gene transcription in response to metal ions and the phenolic antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ). A model is presented in which zinc treatment induces MTF-1-mediated alteration of chromatin structure, which allows the binding of positively acting factors to the MT promoter. Material—Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Pickering, Ontario), [α-32P]dCTP was from (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and synthetic oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen. The polyclonal anti-NF1 antibody used for the supershift was provided by René Saint-Arnaud, Shriners Hospital, Montréal (29Candeliere G.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell.

Constructs Δ-590-LUC, Δ-238-LUC, and Δ-150-LUC contain mouse MT-1 promoter sequence positions –590 (relative to the transcription start point) to +68, –238 to +68, and –150 to +68, respectively, in pGL2 basic. To construct the reporter plasmids (NF1ab)MT1m-LUC and (MREdd)MT1m-LUC, the double-stranded oligonucleotides NF1ab and MREdd (Table 1), respectively, were inserted in front of a minimal mouse MT-1 gene promoter (MT1m, –34 to +68) (31Faraonio R.

The NF1ab oligonucleotides contain NF1a and NF1b sites organized in tandem, whereas the MREdd oligonucleotide contains two strong mouse MT-1 MREd elements in opposite orientation. The reporter plasmid NF1ab(MREdd)MT1m-LUC was generated by inserting the NF1ab oligonucleotide into plasmid (MREdd)MT1m-LUC upstream of the MREdd oligonucleotide. Plasmid (MREa)6MT1m-LUC contains six mouse MT-1 MREa elements in front of a minimal mouse MT-1 promoter in pGL2 basic (32LaRochelle O. Gagné V. Charron J. Soh J.W. Séguin C. J. Biol.

The resulting fragments were subcloned into pGL2 Basic to generate a series of plasmids with mutation(s) in the NF1a (NF1aΔ-LUC), NF1b (NF1bΔ-LUC), and NF1a and NF1b (NF1abΔ-LUC) sites. For all the constructs and mutants, correct insertions and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Metal-resistant mouse L50 fibroblast cells were obtained from Dean H. Hamer (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The human HepG2 cells used for transient transfection were from A. Anderson (Centre de Recherche, l'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec), whereas those used to generate stable transfectants were from Jacques Pouysségur (Institute of Signaling, Developmental Biology and Cancer Research, Nice, France). For large scale nuclear extract preparations, L50 cells were grown in suspension in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum in the continuous presence of 50 μm ZnCl2. For small scale analytic experiments, L50 and HepG2 cells were cultured in monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with the different plasmids by the calcium phosphate method (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), treated or not with CdCl2 (final concentration 2.5 μm), ZnCl2 (100 μm), or tBHQ (100 μm) and harvested after 6–8 h (32LaRochelle O. Gagné V. Charron J. Soh J.W. Séguin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41879-41888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded (∼4 × 105/6-cm plate) 16 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid MT1-LUC, or the different mutants, or 7.5 μg of the plasmids (NF1ab)MT1m-LUC, (MREdd)MT1m-LUC, or NF1ab(MREdd)MT1m-LUC, shocked for 3 min at 37 °C with 15% glycerol in HEPES-buffered saline, incubated for 12 h in growth medium, and then treated or not with metals or tBHQ. In some experiments, cells were cotransfected with 1, 5, 10, or 50 ng of the NF1 expression vectors p113-CTF-1 or p113-CTF-1Δ, as indicated in the figure legend. The plasmid pTK-rLUC (Promega) was used as internal standard to monitor transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA added to the cells was adjusted to 10 μg per dish with pGL2 basic DNA. Luciferase (LUC) activities were determined with a Dual-LUC assay kit (Promega) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The transcriptional activity of the reporter plasmids was evaluated in duplicate in two or three different independent transfections. For stable transfections, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with the MT1-LUC, NF1aΔ-LUC, NF1bΔ-LUC, NF1abΔ-LUC, or pGL2-basic reporter plasmid, and the amiloride-resistant Na+-H+ exchanger expression vector, pNHE1-R (kindly provided by Dr. J. Pouysségur) (34Pouysségur J. Roux D. Baker A.H. Methods in Molecular Medecine, Vascular Disease: Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 315-321Google Scholar), with a 20:1 ratio. For the selection of stably transfected cells, three H+-suicide selections were applied (34Pouysségur J. Roux D. Baker A.H. Methods in Molecular Medecine, Vascular Disease: Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 315-321Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from two different pools of stable populations transfected with the different plasmids. LUC activity was measured and expressed as relative LUC activity per microgram of total cellular protein. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad assay kit (Mississauga, Ontario). Nuclear Extract Preparation, EMSAs, DNaseI Footprinting Analysis, UV Cross-linking Assay, and Chromatography—For the NF1 EMSA, 5–6 μg of nuclear extract (24LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was mixed in EMSA binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3.3% Ficoll, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 500 ng of poly[dI-dC]2 (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) and 20 fmol of 32P-end-labeled probe, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Tris/borate buffer (22 mm Tris base and 22 mm boric acid). Methods for EMSA analysis using the C/EBP oligonucleotide as the probe have been described (24LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNaseI footprinting assays were performed (35Thomassin H. Hamel D. Bernier D. Guertin M. Belanger L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using a mouse MT-1 restriction fragment 5′-end-labeled at –41 and extending to –200, or a mouse MT-1 PCR-amplified fragment, –348 to +72, as the probe (24LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the UV cross-linking assay (36Labbé S. Prévost J. Remondelli P. Leone A. Séguin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the probe was prepared by hybridizing the NF1b oligonucleotide (Table 1) to a 9-base complementary primer (5′-GCGTCCTT). This oligonucleotide was rendered completely double-stranded with he Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in presence of [α32P]dATP. For competition experiments, specific double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides (Table 1), as indicated in the figure legends, were added together with the probe. In supershift experiments, 2 μl of an anti-NF1 or an anti-C/EBP-β (Δ198, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) polyclonal antibody was added to the binding reaction, the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 21 °C, followed by addition of the labeled oligonucleotide probe. Rabbit antiserum to mouse MT-3 4P. Moffatt and C. Séguin, unpublished results. was used as a negative control. MRE-binding proteins were purified from 60 ml of L50-cell crude nuclear extracts (10 μg protein/μl) by standard chromatography with NaCl gradient elution (24LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Experiments—NF1 ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP-it Express kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were treated or not with 100 μm zinc for 3 h and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. The chromatin was immunoprecipitated with an anti-NF1 antibody (N-20X or H-300, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or normal rabbit serum or IgG (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The MTF-1 ChIP assay was performed as described (37Aparicio O. Geisberg J.V. Sekinger E. Yang A. Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene/Wiley Interscience, New York2005: 21.3.8-21.3.11Google Scholar) with some modifications. Protein A-Sepharose beads were first coupled to 6 μg of an anti-MTF-1 polyclonal antibody or preimmune serum in presence of 20 μg of bovine serum albumin and 20 μg of herring sperm DNA (Invitrogen). The Sepharose-conjugated anti-MTF-1 antibody was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an amount of chromatin corresponding to 1.6 × 106 liters of cells. The resulting DNA was analyzed by PCR using a pair of primers corresponding to the mouse MT-1 promoter region –230 to –80. As a negative control, each ChIP sample was also subjected to PCR using primers specific to a region located in the coding region of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GenBank™ accession number X53617), positions +1841 to +1992. In some experiments, MTF-1-null mutant dko7 cells (38Radtke F. Georgiev O. Muller H.P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. W. Schaffner, Zurich) were transfected with 500 ng of a CMV-MTF-1 expression vectors (24LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 24 h before metal induction using the ExGen 500 transfection reagent (Fermentas LifeSciences, Burlington, Ontario) following the manufacturers' instructions. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) staining. Samples were subjected to PCR for different numbers of cycles to ensure that amplification was in the linear range. These ChIP experiments were performed three time using two different chromatin preparations. The anti-MTF-1 antibody was raised in rabbit by using purified, bacterially expressed protein representing the C-terminal region of mouse MTF-1 (amino acids 577–675) fused to glutathione S-transferase. Anti-MTF-1 antibody was purified on a PROSEP-A column (Millipore, Etobicoke, ON). The anti-MTF-1 antibody specifically recognized a protein of Mr 100,000 that is absent in dko7 cell extracts (data not shown). Identification of a Protein Specifically Binding to the MREc Region—To elucidate the nature of the MREc-binding protein, mouse nuclear extracts were fractionated on a heparin-Sepharose column and analyzed by DNaseI footprinting analysis. In agreement with our previous observations (23Labbé S. Larouche L. Mailhot D. Séguin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Séguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), footprints were present over the Sp1a, MREd-Sp1b, MREc, and USF/ARE sites (Fig. 2A, lane 1). MTF-1 binds to MREd and induces the formation of a DNaseI-hypersensitive site at –153 (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6, stars). In heparin-Sepharose chromatography, MTF-1, defined as the MREd-binding protein, mainly eluted in fractions 3–5, as indicated by the hypersensitive site at –153. However, the MREc-binding protein as well as the protein binding to the Sp1a region remained present in all the other fractions, including fractions 11–13 depleted of MTF-1 (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 4 and 14). This suggests the presence of two distinct proteins. To assess the specificity of the MREc-binding protein, fractions 3–13 (Fig. 2A) were loaded onto an MREa-affinity column and eluted by three salt steps. Two MRE-binding proteins species were eluted from the MRE affinity chromatography. First, an MREc-binding activity present in all the fractions from 250 mm to 650 mm salt and second, MTF-1 found predominantly in the second 650 mm salt fraction (Fig. 2B, lane 8, star). Like the MREc-binding protein, the Sp1a-binding protein was present in all the fractions (Fig. 2B), whereas USF/ARE activity was found in the 250 mm fraction (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Note that the 250 mm salt fraction containing the MREc-binding protein is completely devoid of MREd-binding activity (Fig. 2B, lane 3), clearly indicating that the MREc-binding protein is distinct from the MREd-binding protein MTF-1. To further characterize the MREc-binding protein, foot-printing competition assays were performed using a crude nuclear extract (Fig. 3A) or the 250 mm salt affinity fraction (Fig. 3B) specifically containing the MREc-binding activity and depleted of MTF-1 (see Fig. 2B, lane 3). The oligonucleotides MREc and MREd (Table 1), as well as the negative control MUTds (39Séguin C. Prévost J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10547-10560Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), did not compete for the MREc-binding protein (Fig. 3, A and B). However, in MTF-1-containing extracts, the MREc and MREd oligonucleotides efficiently competed MTF-1 on the MREd element (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–9, and data not shown) (36Labbé S. Prévost J. Remondelli P. Leone A. Séguin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), thus further indicating that the MREc-binding protein is distinct from MTF-1. Fine mapping of the footprint over the MREc region, performed by comparing with a Maxam and Gilbert sequence ladder, revealed that the protected region extends from –126 to –109 (Fig. 3C). Notably, this excludes the first three nucleotides in the MRE consensus sequence of the MREc element, namely the highly conserved TGC nucleotides. Because each of these three nucleotides is critical for metal induction (40Culotta V.C. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and MTF-1 DNA binding (41Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), this virtually excludes the possibility that the MREc-binding protein corresponds to MTF-1. This also suggests that the MREc element is not a bona fide MRE. Close examination of the nucleotide sequence of the protected region using DNA transcription factor binding site prediction programs identified a perfect NF1 half site (GCCAA, NF1b) in the protected region. In addition, a second NF1 half site (NF1a) is present on the mouse MT-1 promoter upstream of the Sp1a site (Figs. 3C and 4A). To further assess the identity of the MREc-binding protein, DNaseI footprinting competition experiments were performed using as competitor DNA an oligonucleotide, MREcl, corresponding to the DNaseI protected region in the MREc region, namely the entire MREc consensus sequence and the putative NF1 half site (Fig. 3C). We also used the oligonucleotides NF1b, a shorter version of MREcl in which the first n"

Recent studies have revealed the details of folding cycles of GroEL from Escherichia coli, yet little is known about the GroEL-assisted protein folding mechanisms in other bacterial species. Using three model enzyme assays, we have found that GroEL1 from Chlamydophila pneumoniae, an obligate human pathogen, has a broader selectivity for nucleotides in the refolding reaction. To elucidate structural factors involved in such nucleotide selectivity, GroEL chimeras were constructed by exchanging apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains between E. coli GroEL and C. pneumoniae GroEL1. In vitro folding assays using chimeras revealed that the intermediate domain is the major contributor to the nucleotide selectivity of C. pneumoniae GroEL1. Additional site-directed mutation experiments led to the identification of Gln400 and Ile404 in the intermediate domain of C. pneumoniae GroEL1 as residues that play a key role in defining the nucleotide selectivity of the protein refolding reaction.

The chaperonin GroEL is a cylindrical homotetradecamer with a molecular mass of 800 kDa (1Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of three functional domains: an apical domain, which has a polypeptide and a co-chaperonin GroES-binding site, and an intermediate domain, which connects the apical domain containing a ligand and GroES-binding sites with the equatorial domain containing a nucleotide-binding pocket. Recent proteomic analysis has shown that ∼250 different proteins interact with GroEL in Escherichia coli (2Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y. Maier T. Chang H.C. Stines A.P. Georgopoulos C. Frishman D. Hayer-Hartl M. Mann M. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2005; 122: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Of these, only ∼85 proteins are obligate GroEL-dependent substrates. The current understanding of the folding pathway for obligate substrates of GroEL is as follows. In the first step, substrate proteins bind to the apical domain of GroEL, which permits ATP binding to the equatorial domain. Subsequently, GroES binds to the substrate-binding site of the apical domain. In the second step, the intermediate domain rises, forming a cis-ATP complex, and then substrate protein is loaded into the central cavity of GroEL. In the third step, ATP hydrolysis induces trans-ring activation followed by ATP and substrate protein binding to the trans-ring. Finally, the cis-ternary complex decays, releasing GroES and ADP from the cis-ring. The substrate protein is then released whether it is folded or not. Consequently, only a small percentage of the molecule is folded in a single round of the ATP- and GroES-mediated cycle (3Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 4Horwich A.L. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1917-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Other GroEL/GroES-assisted folding pathways also exist. One pathway is the trans-ring-mediated pathway for substrate proteins that are too large to be encapsulated (5Huang Y.S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Chaudhuri T.K. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Rospert S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Another folding pathway is GroES-independent, in which non-obligate substrates are folded in the presence and absence of GroES, and the yield of the GroES-dependent pathway is generally higher than that of the GroES-independent pathway. Even though these concepts have been well established in the model microorganism E. coli, it is unknown whether they are generally applicable. Chlamydophila pneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacterium that is an obligate intracellular parasite of eukaryotic cells (7Grayston J.T. Kuo C.C. Campbell L.A. Wang S.P. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1988; 39: 88-90Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This bacterium is a human pathogen that causes acute respiratory disease. Most bacterial genomes encode a single copy of the groEL gene that forms an operon with the groES gene, but the Chlamydiae clade has three groEL genes that result from complex events of gene duplication (8Goyal K. Qamra R. Mande S.C. J. Mol. Evol. 2006; 63: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Of these, only the groEL1 gene consists of a groE operon with a groES gene. Western blot and microarray analyses have shown that all three genes are constitutively expressed, but the expression levels of the groEL2 and groEL3 genes are not influenced by heat shock in Chlamydia trachomatis (9Karunakaran K.P. Noguchi Y. Read T.D. Cherkasov A. Kwee J. Shen C. Nelson C.C. Brunham R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1958-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have expressed the groEL1 and groES genes from C. pneumoniae strain J138 in E. coli and purified the gene products to investigate whether C. pneumoniae GroEL1 (CP GroEL1) 2The abbreviations used are: CP GroEL1C. pneumoniae GroEL1METF5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductaseLDHd-lactate dehydrogenaseAGLUα-glucosidaseEC GroELE. coli GroELATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)AMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate)MOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. is able to refold three types of denatured enzymes according to previously characterized mechanisms.

In this study, three types of substrate enzymes were used to characterize CP GroEL1: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (METF), which is an obligate substrate for E. coli GroEL (EC GroEL); d-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which partially interacts with GroEL; and α-glucosidase (AGLU), which is too large to be encapsulated in the GroEL/GroES cavity. In characterizing CP GroEL1, we took into consideration the fact that EC GroEL assists refolding of these enzymes in the presence of ATP (2Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y. Maier T. Chang H.C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19346-19351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the protein folding assay was also conducted in the presence of various nucleotides (i.e. CTP, UTP, GTP, and their di- or monophosphates) to elucidate the nucleotide selectivity of CP GroEL1- as well as EC GroEL-assisted protein refolding. We report here that CP GroEL1 shows broader nucleotide selectivity for protein refolding compared with EC GroEL and that CP GroEL1 residues that play a critical role in such broad nucleotide selectivity are located in the intermediate domain. Gene Cloning, Chimera Construction, and Mutagenesis—The groEL and groES genes from E. coli strain K12 and the groEL1 and groES genes from C. pneumoniae strain J138 were cloned into the pET22b(+) vector (Novagen). The metf gene fused with His tag sequences at the 3′-end was also cloned into the pET22b(+) vector. Moreover, a series of chimera groEL genes with exchanged apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains of the groEL gene from E. coli and the groEL1 gene from C. pneumoniae were constructed by an overlap extension method using PCR (18Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pET22b(+) vector. Mutant groEL genes were also constructed by DpnI-mediated site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into the pET22b(+) vector. All genes were ligated into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET22b(+) vector. The primer sets for gene cloning, chimera construction, and mutagenesis using PCR are listed in supplemental Tables S1-S3, respectively. Moreover, schematic representations of primer annealing sites for the preparation of the chimeric genes are shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Protein Purification—The recombinant proteins GroEL GroES, and METF were purified as described previously (19Okuda H. Sakuhana C. Yamamoto R. Kawai R. Mizukami Y. Matsuda K. Biometals. 2007; 20: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of EC GroEL, CP GroEL1, and their chimeras were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI micro MX, Waters Corp., Tokyo, Japan). METF Refolding Assay—METF (EC 1.5.1.20) from E. coli is a homotetrameric protein with a subunit molecular mass of 33,100 Da. It catalyzes the reduction of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate using the reductant NAD(P)H and coenzyme FAD. Unless stated otherwise, the concentrations of GroEL, GroES, METF, and LDH are expressed as tetradecamer, heptamer, tetramer, and dimer, respectively. METF refolding assay was carried out as described in our previous study (19Okuda H. Sakuhana C. Yamamoto R. Kawai R. Mizukami Y. Matsuda K. Biometals. 2007; 20: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) with a modification. When testing ADP in the refolding reaction, ATP contamination was eliminated as much as possible by hexokinase/glucose treatment (16Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). LDH Refolding Assay—LDH (EC 1.1.1.28) from Staphylococcus sp. (Amano Enzyme Inc., Aichi, Japan) partially interacts with GroEL and is a homodimeric protein with a subunit molecular mass of 32,000 Da. It catalyzes reversible conversions of pyruvate to lactate and of NADH to NAD+. LDH (10 μm) was denatured with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride for 1 h at 25 °C. The unfolded LDH was diluted 100-fold at 25 °C into refolding buffer (50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with or without 0.5 μm GroEL, 1 μm GroES, and 2 mm nucleotide). LDH activity was assayed at 25 °C by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm in LDH assay solution (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 μm NADH, and 100 μm sodium pyruvate). AGLU Refolding Assay—AGLU (EC 3.2.1.20) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sigma), which is too large to be encapsulated in the GroEL/GroES cavity, is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 68,000 Da. It hydrolyzes an α-glucosyl bond present in its substrates. AGLU (10 μm) was denatured with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 1 h at 25 °C. The unfolded AGLU was diluted 100-fold at 25 °C into refolding buffer with or without 0.5 μm GroEL, 1 μm GroES, and 2 mm nucleotide. AGLU activity was assayed at 25 °C by monitoring absorbance at 405 nm, resulting from the release of p-nitrophenol in AGLU assay solution (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 2 mm p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside). Refolding of Denatured Enzymes by CP GroEL1/CP GroES—First, the time-dependent refolding of the obligate substrate METF, partial substrate LDH, and large substrate AGLU by GroEL proteins was investigated with and without ATP and GroES. Purified METF failed to refold spontaneously in refolding buffer. However, METF was recovered by ∼40% within a few minutes in the presence of CP GroEL1 with CP GroES and ATP, but not without CP GroES (Fig. 1a). Similarly, METF was recovered in the presence of EC GroEL with EC GroES and ATP. In contrast, LDH was recovered by ∼60% 7 h after the start of the refolding reaction in the presence of CP GroEL1 with CP GroES and ATP and even in the presence of CP GroEL1 and ATP. LDH was scarcely recovered in the absence of CP GroEL1 (Fig. 1b). The protein refolding activities of CP GroEL1 and EC GroEL were also observed for AGLU from yeast. AGLU was recovered spontaneously by ∼10%, but greater recovery of enzyme activity was observed when CP GroEL1/CP GroES or EC GroEL/EC GroES was added to the reaction in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1c). In the absence of ATP, CP GroEL1/CP GroES allowed spontaneous refolding of the enzyme, whereas EC GroEL/EC GroES completely arrested the refolding reaction. Similar events were also observed when either CP GroEL1 or EC GroEL alone was added to refolding buffer in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1d). Effects of Various Nucleotides on GroEL-assisted Protein Refolding—Because CP GroEL1 has protein refolding activity, the effects of diverse nucleotides on the protein refolding by the two chaperonins were examined. METF was refolded by CP and EC GroEL/GroES in the presence of nucleotide triphosphates (ATP, CTP, and UTP), excluding GTP (Fig. 2, a and b). Nucleotide monophosphate species (AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) and inosine species (ITP, IDP, and IMP) were incapable of enhancing METF, LDH, and AGLU refolding (data not shown). Interestingly, CTP, CDP, UTP, and UDP permitted LDH refolding either by CP GroEL1/CP GroES or by CP GroEL1 alone (Fig. 2c), whereas addition of these nucleotides was ineffective in LDH refolding by EC GroEL irrespective of the presence or absence of EC GroES (Fig. 2d). The nucleotide sensitivity of the refolding reaction for AGLU by CP GroEL1/CP GroES and CP GroEL1 alone resembled that observed for LDH (Fig. 2e). However, both CTP and UTP permitted the EC GroEL/EC GroES-assisted refolding of AGLU (Fig. 2f). In contrast to the observed differences in nucleotide selectivity in the protein refolding reactions, both CP GroEL1 and EC GroEL hydrolyzed CTP and UTP as well as ATP, but not GTP (supplemental Fig. S1, a and b). Also, neither GroEL hydrolyzed ITP (data not shown). Nucleotide Selectivity for LDH Refolding by GroEL Chimeras—Because a marked difference was observed for nucleotide selectivity in LDH refolding by CP GroEL1 and EC GroEL, we investigated structural features that could explain this result. For this purpose, a series of GroEL chimeras were constructed by exchanging apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains between the two GroEL proteins, and the in vitro LDH refolding assays were carried out in the presence of various nucleotides. GroEL proteins consist of N-terminal side equatorial (EN), N-terminal side intermediate (IN), apical (A), C-terminal side intermediate (IC), and C-terminal side equatorial (EC) regions (Fig. 3, a and b). In this study, each GroEL chimera is designated by five “C” and “E” letters representing the EN to EC regions, where “C” and “E” indicate that the regions are from C. pneumoniae and E. coli, respectively. Schematic structures of the chimeras are shown in Fig. 3, in which the color white indicates “C,” and the color gray indicates “E.” Each GroEL chimera was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified. All the chimeras were assembled to yield 800-kDa complexes, as revealed by gel filtration and native PAGE analysis. Exchanging apical domains with each other (CCECC and EECEE) barely affected nucleotide selectivity in GroEL-assisted LDH refolding (Fig. 3, c and f). However, the EECEE chimera-assisted LDH refolding was much lower compared with wild-type EC GroEL-assisted LDH refolding in the presence of ATP and ADP (Fig. 3f), whereas ATP hydrolysis by the EECEE chimera was greater than that by wild-type EC GroEL (supplemental Fig. S2b). Interestingly, the ECECE chimera, in which the intermediate domain of EC GroEL was replaced with the corresponding region of CP GroEL1, assisted the LDH refolding in the presence of various nucleotides (Fig. 3g). In this case, the LDH refolding yield in the presence of CTP, UTP, and their diphosphates was about half of the corresponding yield achieved by wild-type CP GroEL1. Further addition of a C region to the apical domain reduced the refolding yield of LDH, but retained the broad nucleotide selectivity phenotype (Fig. 3e). These chimeras were capable of METF refolding, ATP hydrolysis, and METF capsulation (supplemental Fig. S2, a-d). In contrast, the CECEC and CEEEC chimeras enhanced LDH refolding in the presence of ADP and CDP, but not ATP (Fig. 3, d and h). These two GroEL chimeras had no METF refolding, ATP hydrolysis, and METF capsulation activities (supplemental Fig. S2, a-d). Moreover, in the presence of ATP, ADP-induced LDH refolding by the CECEC GroEL chimera was completely suppressed (data not shown). Comparison of the ECECE chimera with wild-type EC GroEL indicated a major role for the Chlamydophila intermediate domain in providing broad nucleotide selectivity in LDH refolding. Therefore, we further investigated the structural factors of the intermediate domain that could be involved in such a function. Construction of the ECEEE and EEECE chimeras led to the finding that the EEECE chimera has broader nucleotide selectivity compared with the ECEEE chimera in the LDH refolding assay (Fig. 3, i and j). Although the CECCC chimera failed to assemble, the CCCEC chimera assembled to refold LDH. We found that the CCCEC chimera retained LDH refolding activity in the presence of ATP, ADP, CTP, CDP, UTP, and UDP, but the refolding yield in the presence of ATP was significantly reduced by replacement of the IC region (Fig. 3k). The amino acid sequences of the IC regions of EC and CP GroEL proteins were aligned to identify the residues unique to C. pneumoniae as well as the consensus sequences (Fig. 4a). We found that Arg380, Ile387, Asp394, Asp397, Gln400, and Ile404 are present in C. pneumoniae but not in E. coli. Of these, Gln400 and Ile404 are seen only in Chlamydophila and Chlamydia species (data not shown). Leu400 and Arg404 of EC GroEL correspond to Gln400 and Ile404 of CP GroEL1, respectively, and face the apical domain in the crystal structure of the T state (Fig. 4b). Therefore, Leu400 and Arg404 of EC GroEL were replaced alone or in combination with the corresponding residues of CP GroEL1. The R404I mutation barely enhanced the nucleotide selectivity (Fig. 4d), whereas the L400Q mutation resulted in enhanced ADP- and CTP-mediated refolding activities (Fig. 4c). Yet the mutant still lacked the refolding function in the presence of UTP. The L400Q/R404I double mutant was then tested to examine whether this structural change leads to a gain in UTP selectivity. We found that the double mutant could carry out the refolding reaction when UTP was added to the buffer (Fig. 4e). GroEL1 from C. pneumoniae Acts as a Chaperonin—Chlamydiaceae bacteria proliferate as energy-dependent parasites in living cells, taking high energy metabolites such as nucleotide triphosphates and acetyl-CoA from their host cells. The heat shock protein Hsp60 (GroEL) from Chlamydiaceae bacteria has been shown to induce abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, thereby possibly contributing to early stages of atherogenesis (20Campbell L.A. Kuo C.C. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 21Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4735) Google Scholar). Such cell proliferation by C. pneumoniae probably results from activation of the host cell innate immune system through interactions with Toll-like receptors (22Sasu S. LaVerda D. Qureshi N. Golenbock D.T. Beasley D. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Karahashi H. Michelsen K.S. Equils O. Morrison S.G. Morrison R.P. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), yet it is unclear whether CP GroEL1 has protein refolding functions similar to EC GroEL. Therefore, for the first time, we have investigated in vitro protein refolding by CP GroEL1/CP GroES. We found that CP GroEL1 has a protein folding function with broader nucleotide selectivity compared with EC GroEL. CP GroEL1 refolded METF with an activity of ∼40% relative to native enzyme activity within a few minutes (Fig. 1a) and hydrolyzed ATP to a similar extent compared with EC GroEL (supplemental Fig. S1). CP GroEL1 utilized only CP GroES for METF folding, whereas EC GroEL utilized both EC GroES and CP GroES (supplemental Fig. S2a). Consistent with this, CP GroEL1-induced ATP hydrolysis was not inhibited by addition of EC GroES (supplemental Fig. S2b), and denatured METF was not capsulated (supplemental Fig. S2, c and d). These results suggest that CP GroEL1 has protein folding functions and that there is stringent selectivity for GroES. AGLU recovered spontaneously from the denatured state by 10% compared with the activity of the native enzyme, as reported previously (11Holl-Neugebauer B. Rudolph R. Schmidt M. Buchner J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11609-11614Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, EC GroEL completely arrested the denatured AGLU, whereas CP GroEL1 did not, instead permitting the spontaneous refolding of the enzyme. Therefore, CP GroEL1 is thought to have a lower binding capacity for AGLU compared with EC GroEL. Unique Nucleotide Selectivity of GroEL1 from C. pneumoniae—The chaperonins GroEL and GroES fold newly synthesized and denatured proteins in the presence of ATP in cells. Because they utilize ATP for the protein folding reaction, ATP is thought to have high affinity for GroEL and is present at high concentrations in cells compared with other nucleotides. However, many ATPases can bind not only ATP but also CTP and UTP, contrasting with GTPases, which use only GTP in vitro. Previous studies showed that EC GroEL can also use not only ATP but also CTP and UTP for enolase refolding (17Kubo T. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19346-19351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CTP but not UTP for ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase refolding (24Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In addition, EC GroEL even enhances protein refolding of some substrates in the presence of the ADP and ATP analogs ATPγS and AMP-PNP (13Mizobata T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Yumoto N. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17773-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hayer-Hartl M.K. Martin J. Hartl F.U.

Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, it was shown that stringent substrates are not refolded by EC GroEL in the presence of the unhydrolyzed species ADP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP (16Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study, METF, the obligate substrate for EC GroEL (2Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y.

A. 2006; 103: 15800-15805Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was recovered both by EC GroEL/EC GroES and by CP GroEL1/CP GroES in the presence of ATP, CTP, and UTP (Fig. 2, a and b), suggesting that only hydrolyzable nucleotide species can be utilized for the refolding reaction. Consistent with this observation, both CP GroEL1 and EC GroEL hydrolyzed not only ATP but also CTP and UTP, but not GTP (supplemental Fig. S1). Unlike the case for the METF refolding reaction, a marked difference in nucleotide selectivity was observed between CP GroEL1 and EC GroEL for refolding LDH (Fig. 2, c and d) and AGLU (Fig. 2, e and f). EC GroEL did not refold LDH in the presence of CTP and UTP, whereas CP GroEL1 did. Investigation of the primary sequence showed that all the amino acid residues identified to date as playing important roles in protein folding are completely conserved in CP GroEL1 (100% identity) (27Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was thought that unidentified structural features are likely to be involved in the broad nucleotide selectivity of CP GroEL1 for refolding of LDH and AGLU. The Intermediate Domain Defines Nucleotide Selectivity for GroEL-assisted Refolding—A broader nucleotide selectivity was observed for CP GroEL1-assisted refolding of LDH and AGLU compared with EC GroEL-assisted refolding of the respective proteins. However, the CP GroEL1-assisted AGLU refolding yield included a spontaneously refolding fraction. Moreover, the nucleotide selectivity of CP GroEL1 for LDH refolding was much broader than that for AGLU refolding (Fig. 2). Therefore, we chose the LDH refolding reaction to identify structural factors contributing to the observed nucleotide selectivity. In these experiments, neither EC GroES nor CP GroES was added to the refolding assay to allow interpretation of the refolding reaction catalyzed by the chimeras and mutants of EC GroEL and CP GroEL1. Exchanging the apical domain between EC GroEL and CP GroEL1 barely affected the nucleotide selectivity for the LDH refolding reaction (Fig. 3, c and f), excluding the apical domain from factors that make a major contribution to the observed nucleotide selectivity. The EECEE chimera-assisted LDH refolding yield was much lower than that assisted by wild-type EC GroEL, which might be due to enhanced ATP hydrolysis by domain swapping. The most prominent changes in the nucleotide selectivity for the LDH refolding reaction were observed when the intermediate domains of EC GroEL were replaced with the corresponding domains of CP GroEL1 (see the ECECE chimera-assisted refolding reaction in Fig. 3g). A direct interpretation of this result is that structural factors permitting such broad nucleotide selectivity are likely to be present in this domain, yet replacing the two intermediate domains of CP GroEL1 with those of EC GroEL resulted in a loss of the ATP-assisted refolding reaction as well as the CTP-, CDP-, UTP-, and UDP-assisted refolding reactions (Fig. 3d). Similar results were also obtained for the CEEEC chimera (Fig. 3h). The CECEC and CEEEC chimeras were incapable of hydrolyzing ATP (supplemental Fig. S2b), which probably underlies the block in the protein refolding reaction cycle. Recent studies have revealed that EC GroEL undergoes dynamic allosteric transitions by ATP binding and hydrolysis during functional folding cycles (28Hyeon C. Lorimer G.H. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18939-18944Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Kipnis Y. Papo N. Haran G. Horovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2007; 104: 8803-8808Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A high affinity for substrate proteins occurs in the T state, whereas ATP binds in the R state. Following this, the GroEL·GroES·ADP complex is formed in the R″ state. The T → R transition involves multiple salt bridge switches, whereas the R → R″ transition is mediated by Lys80-Glu359 salt bridge formation. In this way, structural changes of GroEL involve complicated amino acid residue interactions. The lack of ATPase activity and METF capsulation in the CECEC and CEEEC chimeras suggests that the state is arrested at the R state by addition of ATP to these two constructs. Also, the ADP-enhanced LDH refolding by the CECEC and CEEEC chimeras suggests that either a direct T → R″ transition or folding through an unidentified pathway may occur in these chimeras. The CCCEC chimera construction did not completely abolish the broad nucleotide selectivity, suggesting that amino acid residues involved in this property are present not only in the IC region but also in the IN region. Nevertheless, a comparison of the results observed using the EEECE chimera with those obtained using the ECEEE chimera (Fig. 3, i and j) demonstrates that the IC region plays a pivotal role in the nucleotide selectivity of the LDH refolding reaction. A point mutation of either L400Q or R404I in the IC region of EC GroEL only slightly affected its nucleotide selectivity (Fig. 4, c and d). However, the L400Q/R404I double mutation markedly increased nucleotide sensitivity. Further addition of the A394D mutation to the L400Q/R404I double mutation scarcely influenced the nucleotide selectivity (data not shown), demonstrating that Gln400 and Ile404 contribute cooperatively and mainly to the broad nucleotide selectivity of the CP CroEL1-assisted LDH refolding. This was confirmed by a Q400L/I404R reverse double mutation in CP GroEL1, which reduced its nucleotide selectivity (data not shown). Leu400 and Arg404 in the T state (Protein Data Bank code 1OEL) (31Braig K. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), R state (code 2C7E) (32Ranson N.A. Farr G.W. Roseman A.M. Gowen B. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Saibil H.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 869-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and R″ state (code 1AON) (1Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) of EC GroEL are shown in Fig. 5. Because these two amino acid residues are directed opposite the equatorial domain, they would not be expected to contribute directly to the hydrolysis of nucleotides. A recent study using low frequency normal mode analysis has shown domain movement-triggered ligand binding in EC GroEL, which involves “hot spot” amino acid residues in the elastic network model (33Zheng W. Brooks B.R. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7664-7669Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In that report, both Leu400 and Arg404 were listed as hot spots. Consistent with this, Leu400 markedly moves in the R → R″ transition, whereas Arg404 moves in the T → R and R → R″ transitions (Fig. 4). Glu172, another hot spot residue in the IN region, is located in the vicinity of Arg404 in the T state and was thought likely to form a salt bridge with Arg404. However, the E172N/L400Q/R404I triple mutation failed to increase nucleotide selectivity, excluding the formation of a Glu172-Arg404 salt bridge from the factors defining the nucleotide selectivity. Rather, the broad nucleotide selectivity of CP GroEL1 may be the result of other inter-residue communications such as van der Waals contacts that permit the dynamic movement of GroEL in the protein folding reaction. In conclusion, we have found for the first time that 1) CP GroEL1 can refold the three denatured enzymes METF, LDH, and AGLU and 2) utilize not only ATP but also other diverse nucleotides when refolding LDH and AGLU without GroES. Construction of chimeras in conjunction with amino acid substitutions has led to the identification of two amino acids in the intermediate domain that play an important role in determining the broad nucleotide selectivity of the GroEL-assisted LDH folding reaction. Although the mechanism by which these residues control nucleotide binding remains to be studied in more detail, this study has provided the novel concept that regions other than the nucleotide-binding site possess a hidden ability to control nucleotide-binding enzymes in selecting as well as hydrolyzing nucleotide species.

https://openalex.org/W1984174888,"NUCLEAR reactions initiated by heavy nucleons involve the transfer of considerable energy from the incident particle to the target nucleus. The amount of energy carried off by the recoiling nucleus is generally sufficient to break chemical bonds, or in irradiated crystalline substances to move the atom to a new site in the lattice. Little information is available about the chemical form in which these recoil atoms come to rest, but useful surveys of previous work have been given by Libby1, and by Edwards and Davies2. A study of the literature shows that the knowledge of chemical behaviour following high-energy particle bombardments is especially lacking, the well-known Szilard–Chalmers effect having been mainly studied with slow neutrons."

https://openalex.org/W1999705399,"EARLY in the history of D.D.T., Martin and Wain1 suggested that easy dehydrochlorination is necessary for insecticidal action in chlorinated hydrocarbons. This generalization has since been extended to benzene hexachloride, to chlorinated indanes and terpenes. A new group of insecticides, introduced by Julius Hyman and Co., of Denver, Colorado, provides an exception to this rule. For example, 'Compound 118', stated to be 1,2,3,4,10,10-hexachloro-1 : 4,5 : 8-diendomethano-1,4,4a,5,8,8a-hexahydronaphthalene, is stable to alcoholic potash yet is of the same order of insecticidal activity as D.D.T. Fed to caterpillars of Mamestra brassicœ, it was toxic at 0·14 ± 0·003 mgm. per 0·5 gm. larva, the toxic dose of D.D.T. being 0·06 ± 0·011 mgm. To adult Calandra granaria walking on filter paper impregnated with oil-solutions of the insecticides, the relative magnitude of the median effective doses (D.D.T. : 'Compound 118') was, after 68 hr., 4·5 : 1 ; after 90 hr., 2·5 : 1 ; after 120 hr., 1 : 1 ; and after 140 hr., 0·8 : 1. This difference in speed of action and differences in the reactions of the poisoned insects indicate that the two insecticides are dissimilar in their modes of action."

Examined under the microscope, it was found to be covered by minute birefringent crystals which could be identified as sodium nitrate. Similar crystals are also formed on exposing rock salt to the action of nitric acid fumes or to nitrogen dioxide prepared by heating lead nitrate. The crystals obtained when exposing rock salt to α-rays are evidently due to the formation of nitrogen dioxide by the rays in air. The action of the α-rays on the rock salt surface seems, however, also to intervene ; various samples of rock salt that show differences in the rate of colouring by the rays also show differences in the number of microscopic crystals formed, while no difference is found when nitrogen dioxide alone acts on the same samples. Sometimes the microscopic crystals show a marked orientation on the rock salt surface."
