https://openalex.org/W2132200584,"Members of the Pirahã tribe use a ""one-two-many"" system of counting. I ask whether speakers of this innumerate language can appreciate larger numerosities without the benefit of words to encode them. This addresses the classic Whorfian question about whether language can determine thought. Results of numerical tasks with varying cognitive demands show that numerical cognition is clearly affected by the lack of a counting system in the language. Performance with quantities greater than three was remarkably poor, but showed a constant coefficient of variation, which is suggestive of an analog estimation process."

We and others have reported previously that DR5 expression is up-regulated in thapsigargin (THG)-treated human cancer cells. Here, we provide evidence that CHOP is involved in THG up-regulation of DR5, which is a critical step for ER stress-induced apoptosis in human cancer cells. In human colon cancer HCT116 cells, knockdown of DR5 by siRNA blocked THG-induced Bax conformational change along with caspase-3 activation and cell death. Moreover, inhibition of CHOP expression attenuated DR5 up-regulation and apoptosis induced by THG, whereas ectopic expression of DR5 restored the sensitivity of CHOP siRNA-transfected cells to THG-induced apoptosis. In addition to HCT116 cells, inhibition of CHOP or DR5 induction also attenuated THG-induced cell death in other cancer cell lines including LNCaP, A2780S, and DU145, indicating that CHOP and DR5 are critical for ER stress-mediated apoptosis in human carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we identified a potential CHOP-binding site in the 5′-flanking region of the DR5 gene. Mutation of this site abrogated the enhanced reporter activity in response to THG treatment. Together, our findings suggest that CHOP regulates ER stress-induced apoptosis, at least in part, through enhancing DR5 expression in some types of human cancer cells.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; THG, thapsigargin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; siGFP, siDR5, siBid, and siCHOP, siRNA specific for GFP, DR5, Bid, and CHOP, respectively. is the major organelle for protein synthesis and maturation as well as the regulation of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen or depletion of Ca2+ from the ER lumen leads to the ER stress response known as unfold protein response (1Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 2Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). This response improves the ability of protein folding by inducing ER resident chaperones such as Bip and protects the cell from ER stress (1Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 2Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). However, the excess stress from which the cell cannot recover triggers apoptosis through largely unknown mechanisms (3Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 4Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar, 5Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is executed by caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, the activation of which is controlled by two major pathways (6Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In one, the so-called “intrinsic” pathway, various noxious stimuli cause the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c forms a complex, known as the apoptosome, with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 in the presence of ATP/dATP. This results in the processing and activation of this initiator caspase (7Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family of proteins, which consists of both anti- and pro-apoptotic members, controls a critical intracellular checkpoint in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by regulating the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria (8Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar). In contrast, the “extrinsic” pathway utilizes death receptors such as Fas, TNFR1, DR3, DR4, or DR5 for the activation of caspases. Binding of ligand to these cell surface receptors recruits adaptor proteins, such as FADD, to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors, which in turn recruits the initiator procaspase-8 to form a death-inducing signaling complex that induces caspase-8 activation (9Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5154) Google Scholar). Once activated, the upstream initiator caspases cleave and activate downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7, which in turn cleave death substrates and result in the morphological changes associated with apoptosis (10Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). The extrinsic pathway can cross-talk with the intrinsic pathway through caspase-8 cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid that activates the mitochondrial pathway to amplify the apoptotic signal (7Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that thapsigargin (THG), which causes ER stress by inhibiting the ER Ca2+-ATPase, sarco-(endo)-plasmic reticulum ATPase, induces apoptosis of HCT116 cells through a Bax-dependent pathway (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar). A conformational change and mitochondrial translocation of Bax in HCT116 cells is regulated by caspase-8 in response to THG (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we and others (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar, 12He Q. Lee D.I. Rong R. Yu M. Luo X. Klein M. El-Deiry W.S. Huang Y. Hussain A. Sheikh M.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2623-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that DR5 is up-regulated in a variety of human cancer cells after THG treatment. Although these studies clearly indicated that ER stress could up-regulate DR5 expression, whether this event plays a key role in the initiation of apoptosis of human cancer cells in response to ER stress remains to be examined. In this study, therefore, we investigated the role of DR5 in ER stress-mediated apoptosis using RNA interference and found that DR5 is a critical mediator of THG-induced apoptosis in human cancer cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that CHOP is one of the potential regulators of DR5 induction in response to THG. Reagents—Anti-CHOP (F-168) polyclonal antibody and anti-p53 (DO-1) monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. THG, anti-Bax 6A7 and α-tubulin monoclonal antibodies, and anti-Bid, Bax (N-20), Bip, and DR5 polyclonal antibodies were described previously (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Puma antibody (13Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Lin Zhang (University of Pittsburgh). Cell Culture and Transfection—HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa, MDA-MB-468, A2780S, and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. DU145 and LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cell transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—The CHOP cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with EcoRI and XhoI sites. The DR5 expression plasmid pRSC-DR5 was described previously (14MacFarlane M. Ahmad M. Srinivasula S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Cohen G. Alnemri E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25417-25420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of human DR5 genomic DNA was amplified by PCR from HCT116 genomic DNA and cloned into pGL3 firefly luciferase reporter vector (Promega) with SacI and XhoI sites. The deletion mutants and point mutations in the Elk-1-, CHOP-, and NFκB-like sites were generated by a two-step PCR method. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon Research. The siRNA sequences used here were as follows: DR5, AAGUUGCAGCCGUAGUCUUGA; Bid, AAGAAGACAUCAUCCGGAAUA; CHOP, AAGAACCAGCAGAGGUCACAA; GFP, AAGACCCGCGCCGAGGUGAAG. The transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 16 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent was mixed with 400 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 5 min and then incubated with a mixture of 12 μlof20 μm siRNA duplex and 400 μl of Opti-MEM for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The complexes were then applied to cultured cells at ∼70% confluence on a 60-mm plate containing 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 12 h incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—The caspase-3-like activity was measured by using a caspase-3 fluorometric assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cellular extracts containing 50 μg of total proteins were incubated in 200 μl of assay buffer containing the synthetic fluorescent substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC at room temperature for 1 h. Fluorescence resulting from cleavage of the substrate was measured using a fluorometer with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. Luciferase Assay—Cells were cultured in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 20 ng of the Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-SV40 as a normalization control and 200 ng of firefly luciferase constructs containing the DR5 promoter region using LipofectAMINE 2000. After 12 h, the cells were spread onto 96-well plates and further cultured for 12 h. Then, the cells were treated with 1 μm THG or Me2SO for an additional 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured by using the Dual-Glo™ luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HCT116 cells treated with 1 μm THG or control Me2SO for 12 h as described previously (15Yamaguchi H. Ikeda Y. Moreno J.I. Katsumura M. Miyazawa T. Takahashi E. Imakawa K. Sakai S. Christenson R.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The probes used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay were as follows: DR5-CHOP, TTGCGGAGGATTGCGTTGACGA; DR5-CHOP-mutant, TTGCGGAGGACATAGTTGACGA; CHOP-consensus, ATCCAGATGCAATCCCCCCTCG; and SP-1 consensus, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG. The position of the mutated CHOP site is underlined. 5 μg of nuclear extracts and the 32P-labeled DR5-CHOP probe were incubated in 10 μl of binding buffer (0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 4% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence or absence of 100-fold cold competitors at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were then electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. ER Stress Induces DR5 Expression—Because p53 has been shown to induce Bax and DR5 expression in response to DNA damage and because Bax is essential for THG-induced apoptosis of HCT116 cells (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wu G.S. Burns T.F. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Jiang W. Meng R. Krantz I.D. Kao G. Gan D.D. Zhou J.Y. Muschel R. Hamilton S.R.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 18Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Hoffman B. Lieberman D. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar), we first treated HCT116 cells deficient in either Bax or p53 with THG to determine whether p53 is required for ER stress-mediated apoptosis in this human colon cancer cell line. Consistently, Bax-deficient HCT116 cells were resistant to THG-induced cell death, but p53-deficient cells displayed cell death kinetics essentially the same as parental control cells (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that THG induces cell death through a Bax-dependent but p53-independent pathway in HCT116 cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that the protein levels of DR5 were up-regulated, Bax and Bcl-2 remained unchanged, and Bid decreased (because of caspase-8 cleavage) (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar) in HCT116 cells regardless of the status of p53 after THG treatment (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the BH3-only protein Puma was induced by THG in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The data clearly demonstrate that THG induces DR5 expression and apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism in HCT116 cells. To further confirm whether DR5 expression is specifically induced by ER stress in this cell line, we evaluated a variety of cytotoxic agents in Bax-deficient (to avoid apoptosis) HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, treating cells with THG or brefeldin A, both of which are known to cause ER stress, induced protein levels of DR5 and the ER chaperone protein Bip. In contrast, the DNA-damaging agent 5-Fu, the microtubule-damaging agents epothilone B and vinblastine, and the kinase inhibitor staurosporine did not cause ER stress (as measured by Bip induction) and failed to up-regulate DR5 expression (Fig. 1C). These results closely linked ER stress to DR5 induction. In addition to HCT116 cells, THG could induce DR5 in several other human cancer cell lines, including A2780S (ovarian), MDA-MB-468 (breast), LNCaP (prostate), and HeLa (cervix) but had little or no effect in 293 epithelial cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that DR5 up-regulation is a general response of human carcinoma cells to ER stress. Up-regulation of DR5 Is Critical for THG-induced Apoptosis—Although ER stress clearly up-regulates DR5, it is still unclear whether this induction is responsible for the initiation of apoptosis. To address this question, we knocked down DR5 expression by a siRNA duplex against DR5 mRNA and examined its effect on Bax conformation, caspase activation, and cell death in response to THG treatment. In addition, we prepared siRNA for Bid as well because Bid has been shown to be important for death receptor-mediated Bax activation and apoptosis (19Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs were treated with 1 μm THG or Me2SO for 16 h and subjected to immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection of siRNA against DR5 resulted in a suppression of DR5 expression induced by THG in HCT116 cells, compared with cells transfected with the control GFP siRNA. Similarly, Bid siRNA effectively reduced Bid protein in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2A). Apoptosis was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and DEVDase (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp protease) activity. Bax conformational change was assessed by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis with anti-Bax 6A7 antibody (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, both cell death (Fig. 2B) and caspase-3-like activity (Fig. 2C) induced by THG were significantly inhibited in cells transfected with either siDR5 or siBid when compared with siGFP-transfected cells. Moreover, reduction of DR5 or Bid suppressed Bax conformational change, a critical step for Bax-mediated release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria, in response to THG treatment (Fig. 2D). These results, together with our previous report (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar), strongly suggest that the DR5 → caspase-8 → Bid → Bax pathway is essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis of HCT116 cells. Therefore, DR5 induction is a critical step for ER-mediated apoptosis. CHOP Is an Upstream Regulator of DR5—Because CHOP is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family that is induced by ER stress and participates in ER-mediated apoptosis (4Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar), we examined whether CHOP is involved in THG-induced DR5 up-regulation by CHOP siRNA (siCHOP). As shown in Fig. 3A, siCHOP effectively suppressed the induction of CHOP in HCT116 cells after THG treatment. Importantly, concomitant with CHOP reduction, THG-induced DR5 expression was suppressed in siCHOP-transfected cells when compared with control siGFP cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, siCHOP attenuated caspase-3 activation (Fig. 3C) and cell death (Fig. 3B) induced by THG in HCT116 cells. If CHOP controls ER-mediated apoptosis through upregulation of DR5, we reasoned that compensation for the reduction of DR5 in siCHOP-transfected cells by a DR5 expression plasmid should restore the cell sensitivity to THG-induced apoptosis. As expected, ectopic expression of DR5 sensitized HCT116 cells to apoptosis induced by THG with a general correlation between higher levels of DR5 and higher rates of cell death (Fig. 3, D and E). These results suggest that CHOP is involved in THG-induced apoptosis as an upstream regulator of DR5 in HCT116 cells. To extend the role of CHOP-mediated DR5 up-regulation in THG-induced apoptosis to other types of cancer cells, we transfected LNCaP, A2780S, and DU145 with siDR5, siCHOP, or control siGFP. After treatment with THG, the protein levels of DR5 and CHOP (Fig. 4, A and B) and cell viability (Fig. 4C) were examined by immunoblot analysis and trypan blue dye exclusion assay, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, THG treatment induced both DR5 and CHOP expression in control siGFP-transfected cells. In contrast to siGFP, siDR5 and siCHOP suppressed the induction of DR5 and CHOP, respectively, in all cell lines treated with THG, although they were less effective in A2780S cells. Moreover, knockdown of CHOP reduced DR5 induction by THG (Fig. 5B). In general, consistent with their efficacies to suppress DR5 and CHOP induction, siDR5 and siCHOP attenuated THG-induced cell death in LNCaP and DU145 cells but to a lesser extent in A2780S cells (Fig. 4C). These results further support the notion that CHOP-mediated DR5 induction is an important step in the apoptotic pathway activated by ER stress in human cancer cells.Fig. 5CHOP regulates DR5 promoter activity.A, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated reporter plasmids and the relative transcriptional activities were assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, HeLa cells were transfected with DR5/–552 luciferase plasmid containing point mutations (represented in italic/bold font) in the indicated sites and subjected to luciferase assay. C, HeLa cells were co-transfected with DR5/–552 luciferase construct and CHOP expression plasmid or empty vector and subjected to luciferase assay. D, 32P-labeled DR5 probe containing the CHOP-binding site (DR5-CHOP) was incubated without (–) or with nuclear extract from HCT116 cells treated with Me2SO or THG in the presence or absence (–) of the indicated cold competitors. The DNA-protein formation was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and the results were quantified and listed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CHOP Is a Potential Transcription Factor for DR5—A previous report showed that THG enhances the mRNA levels of DR5 and its ligand TRAIL (12He Q. Lee D.I. Rong R. Yu M. Luo X. Klein M. El-Deiry W.S. Huang Y. Hussain A. Sheikh M.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2623-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We also confirmed this result in HCT116 cells by Northern blot (data not shown). Because CHOP is a transcription factor, we next examined whether CHOP regulates DR5 transcription. We first attempted to identify the regions responsible for ER stress in the DR5 5′-flanking sequences by reporter assay. We prepared luciferase reporters with the 5′-flanking region of the DR5 gene between –1523 and –7(+1 represents the translation start site) and a series of deletion mutants (Fig. 5A). These plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells because they show high reporter activity and display essentially the same DR5 induction as in HCT116 cells in response to THG treatment (Fig. 1D). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with or without THG for 24 h and subjected to luciferase assay. As shown in Fig. 5A, the full-length (–1523 to –7) DR5 reporter construct revealed an enhanced luciferase activity in cells treated with 1 μm THG compared with control Me2SO, and deleting the 5′-flanking region until –281 did not reduce its response to THG. However, once deleted to –216 and shorter, the reporters could no longer respond to THG treatment, suggesting that the element responsible for ER stress exists between –281 and –216 of the DR5 gene. In addition, the luciferase activity of the DR5/–132 reporter construct was essentially the same as that of the empty vector, indicating that the basal transcription activity is regulated between –216 and –132 as reported previously (20Yoshida T. Maeda A. Tani N. Sakai T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We next examined the sequences of the 5′-flanking region (–281 to –261) of the DR5 gene and found a potential CHOP-binding site (Fig. 5B). To determine whether the CHOP-binding site is critical for DR5 transcriptional activation in response to THG, we mutated the potential CHOP site in DR5/–552 luciferase plasmid and performed a reporter assay. As controls, we constructed two additional mutants with point mutations in either the Elk-1 or NFκB site. Results of the luciferase assay clearly showed that the potential CHOP-binding site but not the Elk-1 and NFκB sites is essential for THG-mediated transcriptional activation of the DR5/–552 luciferase plasmid (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, when co-transfected with a CHOP expression plasmid, the transcriptional activity of the DR5/–552 luciferase construct was increased (Fig. 5C). Next, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a probe containing the potential CHOP-binding site (DR5-CHOP). Nuclear extracts were prepared from HCT116 cells treated with THG or control Me2SO and incubated with the 32P-labeled DR5-CHOP probe. We observed that a DNA-protein complex was formed, and this was enhanced with THG-treated cell lysate (Fig. 5D). Importantly, this DNA-protein complex was disrupted by the addition of excess cold competitors containing the CHOP-binding site, DR5-CHOP, and CHOP consensus (21Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not the unrelated SP-1 consensus or mutated DR5-CHOP. These results further support the notion that CHOP is directly involved in DR5 transcription. Evidence has been accumulated that apoptotic cell death is initiated in response to excess ER stress (5Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 22Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Although several potential regulators that may control apoptosis induced by ER stress have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the ER-mediated cell death, which seems different between species and cell types, are far from clear. For example, the murine caspase-12 is localized in the ER and becomes activated by ER stress (23Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 24Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), but its human homologue has been reported recently to be involved in inflammation and innate immunity rather than ER stress-induced apoptosis (25Saleh M. Vaillancourt J.P. Graham R.K. Huyck M. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Steinberg M.H. Nolan V. Baldwin C.T. Hotchkiss R.S. Buchman T.G. Zehnbauer B.A. Hayden M.R. Farrer L.A. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Nature. 2004; 429: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the BH3-only protein Puma participates in the induction of ER stress-mediated apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cells (26Reimertz C. Kogel D. Rami A. Chittenden T. Prehn J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In fact, Puma was up-regulated in response to THG in HCT116 cells (Fig. 1B). Although this induction was impaired by inactivation of p53, the p53 knockout cells died essentially the same as their parental cells after THG treatment, suggesting that Puma might contribute to THG-induced cell death but is not essential. Moreover, it has been shown that the ER transmembrane kinase/nuclease Ire1 can activate JNK by recruiting TRAF2 and JNK in response to ER stress in murine embryonic fibroblasts (27Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). However, when we treated HCT116 cells with THG in the presence of JNK inhibitors, no significant effect on DR5 expression or apoptosis could be seen (data not shown). These results argue that the JNK pathway may not be involved in DR5-mediated apoptosis induced by ER stress in HCT116 cells. In this report, we demonstrated that DR5 is a critical regulator for ER stress-induced apoptosis of human carcinoma cells. DR5 was induced by THG in several human cancer cell lines (Figs. 1D and 4A), and knockdown of DR5 by siRNA attenuated THG-induced cell death (Figs. 2B and 4C). We have proposed previously a model that in response to THG treatment, upregulated DR5 activates caspase-8, which cleaves the BH3-only protein Bid to generate active tBid, which in turn induces Bax activation to achieve apoptotic cell death in HCT116 cells (11Yamaguchi H. Bhalla K. Wang H.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1483-1489PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the Bax-deficient HCT116 cells were resistant to THG (Fig. 1A), and knockdown of either DR5 or Bid suppressed Bax conformational change and apoptosis of HCT116 cells in response to ER stress (Fig. 2). However, the human prostate cancer cell line DU145, which lacks the Bax protein, responded well to THG (Fig. 4C). Immunoblot analysis revealed that DU145 has little Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 but high Bak expression compared with HCT 116 cells (data not shown). Considering the redundancy of Bax and Bak, these results suggest that the balance between BH1–3 pro-apoptotic (Bax and Bak) and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins decides the sensitivity of cancer cells to ER stress. CHOP is up-regulated by ER stress and involved in ER-mediated apoptosis. Although several genes regulated by CHOP have been identified, none of them is directly involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis (4Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). It also has been reported that CHOP down-regulates Bcl-2 expression and sensitizes the cells to ER stress (28McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). However, we could not observe Bcl-2 downregulation in HCT116 cells treated with THG (Fig. 1B). In contrast, we showed here that CHOP is responsible for the induction of DR5 by ER stress. Moreover, the present study indicated that DR5 transcription is directly regulated by CHOP, although the results also suggested that other factors might collaborate with CHOP in ER stress-mediated DR5 induction. Therefore, further studies are required to identify additional regulators controlling DR5 up-regulation in response to ER stress. Interestingly, ER stress-mediated DR5 induction is p53-independent (Fig. 1B). This has a significant implication for therapeutic benefit because agents that cause ER stress could be used for a combination treatment with TRAIL against human cancers with p53 mutation. In fact, a prodrug that coupled THG with a prostate-specific antigen has been developed recently (29Denmeade S.R. Jakobsen C.M. Janssen S. Khan S.R. Garrett E.S. Lilja H. Christensen S.B. Isaacs J.T.

Moreover, other anti-neoplastic drugs such as proteasome inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also are known to trigger ER stress (30Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K.

We used multistep DNA-templated organic synthesis to translate libraries of DNA sequences, each containing three “codons,” into libraries of sequence-programmed synthetic small-molecule macrocycles. The resulting DNA-macrocycle conjugates were subjected to in vitro selections for protein affinity. The identity of a single macrocycle possessing known target protein affinity was inferred through the sequence of the amplified DNA template surviving the selection. This work represents the translation, selection, and amplification of libraries of nucleic acids encoding synthetic small molecules rather than biological macromolecules."

To verify this hypothesis, we simultaneously investigated muscle protein synthesis and expression of some factors implicated in insulin signal transduction during hyperinsulinemia and hyperaminoacidemia in 6 young (25±1 year; mean±SEM) and 8 elderly subjects (72±2 year). Incorporation of L-[1-13C] leucine in muscle proteins (fractional synthesis rate, FSR) was measured in vastus lateralis, before and during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic hyperaminoacidemic clamp, together with Western blot analysis of protein kinase B (PKB), mTOR, 4E-BP1, and S6K1 phosphorylation. In basal state, muscle protein FSR was reduced in elderly in comparison with young subjects (0.061±0.004% per hour) vs 0.082±0.010% per hour, elderly vs. young, P<0.05). During clamp, muscle protein FSR was stimulated in young (0.119±0.006% per hour; P<0.05), but this response was significantly lower in elderly subjects (0.084±0.005% per hour, P<0.05 vs young subjects). Phosphorylation of PKB, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 were similarly increased by insulin and amino acid in both groups, except for S6K1 phosphorylation, which was not stimulated in elderly subjects. In conclusion, 1) response of muscle protein synthesis to insulin and amino acid is impaired in elderly humans; 2) a defect in S6K1 pathway activation may be responsible for this alteration. This modification is a mechanistic basis of sarcopenia development during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2123548739,"The contributing role of environmental factors to the development of Parkinson's disease has become increasingly evident. We report that mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures treated with diesel exhaust particles (DEP; 0.22 microM) (5-50 microg/ml) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, as determined by DA-uptake assay and tyrosine-hydroxylase immunocytochemistry (ICC). The selective toxicity of DEP for DA neurons was demonstrated by the lack of DEP effect on both GABA uptake and Neu-N immunoreactive cell number. The critical role of microglia was demonstrated by the failure of neuron-enriched cultures to exhibit DEP-induced DA neurotoxicity, where DEP-induced DA neuron death was reinstated with the addition of microglia to neuron-enriched cultures. OX-42 ICC staining of DEP treated neuron-glia cultures revealed changes in microglia morphology indicative of activation. Intracellular reactive oxygen species and superoxide were produced from enriched-microglia cultures in response to DEP. Neuron-glia cultures from NADPH oxidase deficient (PHOX-/-) mice were insensitive to DEP neurotoxicity when compared with control mice (PHOX+/+). Cytochalasin D inhibited DEP-induced superoxide production in enriched-microglia cultures, implying that DEP must be phagocytized by microglia to produce superoxide. Together, these in vitro data indicate that DEP selectively damages DA neurons through the phagocytic activation of microglial NADPH oxidase and consequent oxidative insult."

Key to their immune response are heavy-chain, homodimeric immunoglobulins called new antigen receptors (IgNARs), in which the variable (V) domains recognize antigens with only a single immunoglobulin domain, akin to camelid heavy-chain V domains. The 1.45 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the type I IgNAR V domain in complex with hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) reveals a minimal antigen-binding domain that contains only two of the three conventional complementarity-determining regions but still binds HEL with nanomolar affinity by means of a binding interface comparable in size to conventional antibodies."

Several pathways that maintain cellular homeostasis were activated in response to these ER disturbances. Here we investigated which of these ER stress-activated pathways induce COX-2 and potentially oncogenesis. Tunicamycin and brefeldin A, two ER stress inducers, increased the expression of COX-2 in ML-1 or MCF-7 cells. Nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activation of pp38 MAPK were observed during ER stress. IκBα kinase inhibitor Bay 11-7082 or IκBα kinase dominant negative mutant significantly inhibited the induction of COX-2. pp38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or eIF2α phosphorylation inhibitor 2-aminopurine attenuated the nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity and COX-2 induction. Expression of mutant hepatitis B virus (HBV) large surface proteins, inducers of ER stress, enhanced the expression of COX-2 in ML-1 and HuH-7 cells. Transgenic mice showed higher expression of COX-2 protein in liver and kidney tissue expressing mutant HBV large surface protein in vivo. Similarly, increased expression of COX-2 mRNA was observed in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue expressing mutant HBV large surface proteins. In ML-1 cells expressing mutant HBV large surface protein, anchorage-independent growth was enhanced, and the enhancement was abolished by the addition of specific COX-2 inhibitors. Thus, ER stress due either to expression of viral surface proteins or drugs can stimulate the expression of COX-2 through the NF-κB and pp38 kinase pathways.

Drugs that perturb ER function (e.g. glycosylation inhibitors such as tunicamycin (TM) or disulfide bond reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol) can be used to study the following two types of ER signal pathways (1Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar): the unfolding protein response (UPR), and the ER-overloaded response (EOR) pathway. The UPR pathway has three components in mammalian cells: basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF6, IRE1 RNA-processing enzyme, and ER localized kinase (PERK). ATF6 is synthesized as an ER transmembrane protein and is cleaved to generate cytosolic transcription factors that migrate to the nucleus. ATF6 cooperates with transcription factor NF-Y to bind mammalian ER stress-responsive elements (ERSE) to UPR-responsive gene promoters, such as GRP78 (16Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K.

In addition to activation of the ERSE-related transcription pattern, ER stress also alters the translational pattern through PERK. The C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase domain of PERK can directly phosphorylate translation factor eIF2α and cause translational repression in response to an upstream ER stress signal (23Harding H.

Because NF-κB is induced by ER stress, and NF-κB can regulate the expression of COX-2, we hypothesized that ER stress may induce the expression of COX-2 and regulate cellular homeostasis. In this report, we demonstrated ER stress induced by tunicamycin (TM) and brefeldin A leads to increased expression of COX-2. The induction of COX-2 was mediated through NF-κB and p38 pathways. Furthermore, ER stress induced by expression of hepatitis B virus surface protein also enhanced the expression of COX-2 in vitro. Mutant hepatitis B virus surface protein expression induced the in vivo expression of COX-2 in transgenic mice. Finally, expression of mutant HBV large surface proteins enhanced anchorage-independent growth of hepatocytes, which is dependent on the induction of COX-2.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Pon-A-inducible Expression of the Mutant Type Pre-S—HuH-7-inducible PreS 1Δ, HuH-7-inducible PreS2Δ, and HuH-7-inducible vector cell lines were gifts from Dr. Ih-Jen Su. The Pre-S plasmid constructs contained ponasterone A (pon-A)-controlling elements. HuH-7 cells were co-transfected with these constructs and the vector pERV3, and stable clones were selected by G418 and hygromycin. The stable clones were treated with 10 μm ponasterone A for 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, and then cell lysates of these were extracted for Western blotting. Preparation of Cytosolic and Nuclear Extracts—ML-1 cells (1 × 106) in 10-cm dishes were incubated for 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h in serum DMEM containing 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin. After treatment, the cells were washed with cold PBS, collected with a cell scraper, harvested by centrifugation, and then by using an NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents kit treated to extract their cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with 2× SDS lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris (pH 6.8), 0.4% SDS, and 20% glycerol). The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using a Micro BCA™ protein assay reagent kit. About 15–25 μg of cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE with 10% acrylamide and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Pierce). Following blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and washing with Tween 20 with Tris-buffered saline (TTBS), the polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in TTBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The second anti-mouse antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2000 dilution) was subsequently incubated with membranes for 1 h at room temperature and washed extensively for 40–50 min with TTBS at room temperature. The blots were probed with the ECL Western blot detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence—5 × 105 cells/well were plated in 4-well chambers in DMEM and treated with 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 6 h. Cells for immunofluorescence microscopy of NF-κB were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were then treated with ice-cold acetone for 1 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were stained for NF-κB translocation using anti-p65 antibody overnight at 4 °C and then anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibody for 1 h. The negative control was cells stained with FITC-conjugated antibody alone. After staining with antibody, cells were viewed with a fluorescence microscope. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Oligonucleotides corresponding to the NF-κB consensus sequences in the murine cox-2 promoter (5′-GAGGTGAGGGGATTCCCTTAGTTAG-3′) were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear protein (5 μg) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) from Amersham Biosciences, 4 μl of gel shift binding 5× buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl), and 100,000 cpm (1 ng) of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide in a final volume of 20 μl. Supershift antibodies (2 μg) were added as indicated. DNA-protein (NF-κB) complexes were resolved at 180 V for 4 h in a TBE-buffered, native 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and visualized with autoradiography using a Fuji Imaging plate in BAS-IP MS 2025 machine. Transgenic Mice Tissue Protein Extraction—The transgenic mouse liver, kidney, and muscle tissues were gifts from Dr. Ih-Jen Su. The Pre-S2Δ transgenic mice were constructed by injection of Pre-S2Δ gene fragment into the male pronucleus of fertilized mouse ova. Microinjection was performed in Fvb/n mice. After 15 months, liver, kidney, or muscle tissue from Pre-S2Δ transgenic mice was homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF). Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Total protein concentrations of the tissue lysates were quantified using the Micro BCA™ protein assay reagent kit following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR—After treatment, the cells were washed with cold PBS and then cells were harvested. Total RNA was extracted from ML-1 cells using VIOGENE (total RNA extraction kit) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia-virus transcriptase. The 5′ and 3′ primers for mouse cox-2-specific gene were 5′-ACT CAC TCA GTT TGT TGA GTC ATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTT GAT TAG TAC TGT AGG GTT ATT-3′ (antisense). The cycling parameters were as follows: 1 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 52 °C for primer annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for polymerization. Meanwhile, the same amount of cDNA was amplified for 25 cycles using specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers: 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ (antisense). The products were visualized after electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The signal level of the bands was quantified densitometrically. RT-PCR for Human HBsAg Type II Hepatoma—The HBsAg type II cells were obtained by micro-laser dissection, and total RNA was extracted for RT-PCR. The cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia-virus transcriptase. The 5′ and 3′ primers for the human COX-2-specific gene were 5′-TTC AAA TGA GAT TGT GGG AAA ATT GCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGA TCA TCT GTG CCT GAG TAT CTT-3′ (antisense). The cycling parameters are as follows: 1 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 52 °C for primer annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for polymerization. Meanwhile, the same amount of cDNA was amplified for 25 cycles by using specific α-actin primers: 5′-ATC ATG TTT GAG ACC TTC AA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAT CTC TTG CTC GAA GTC CA-3′ (antisense). The products were visualized after electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The signal level of the bands was quantified densitometrically. PGE2 EIA Immunoassay—5 × 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well dishes in DMEM and cultured for 24 h. PGE2 levels in the supernatant conditioned medium were then assayed for using a prostaglandin (PG) E2 EIA kit. HBsAg ELISA Kit—Cells were washed with cold PBS and then collected with a cell scraper and harvested by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed; 100 μl of H2O was added, and then the cells were freeze-thawed three times at –80 °C. The level of HBsAg was determined using an ELISA kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Results were presented as the mean ± S.D., and statistical comparisons were made using the Student's t test. Significance was defined at the p < 0.05 or 0.01 level. ER Stress Induced the Expression of COX-2—Cells of the mouse liver immortalized cell line ML-1 were treated with 2.5 μm TM, and the expression of COX-2 was determined by Western blotting and RT-PCR. COX-2 mRNA started to increase 3 h after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 1A), and COX-2 protein was induced 6–12 h after treatment with either tunicamycin or another ER stress inducer brefeldin A. The expression of GRP78, an unfolded protein response chaperone, was enhanced in response to tunicamycin (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the expression of COX-2 protein was enhanced by tunicamycin in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (Fig. 1C). COX-2 Induction Was Transcription-dependent and Nuclear Export-dependent—To elucidate the mechanism of COX-2 induction, ML-1 cells were treated with tunicamycin with or without the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Actinomycin D alone did not alter COX-2 and did abolish tunicamycin-induced COX-2 induction (Fig. 2A). The expression of COX-2 may be regulated at the nuclear export level (48Jang B.C. Munoz-Najar U. Paik J.H. Claffey K. Yoshida M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2773-2776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); therefore, we studied whether the induction of COX-2 by tunicamycin can be inhibited by leptomycin B (LMB), a nuclear export inhibitor. LMB inhibited the COX-2 induction in a dose-dependent fashion within the range 2.5 to 10 μm (data not shown). At the concentration of 5 μm, LMB can inhibit COX-2 induction more than 90% throughout the 24-h time course (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the induction of GRP78 was inhibited by actinomycin D but not leptomycin. COX-2 Induction Is NF-κB-dependent—Transcription factor NF-κB can regulate the expression of COX-2 and may be induced by ER stress. ML-1 hepatocytes were treated with tunicamycin for the indicated time, and the amount of nuclear translocation of NF-κB was determined by Western blot analysis of the nuclear and cytosolic fraction. Increased nuclear translocation of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB was observed after tunicamycin treatment in ML-1 cells with different kinetics (Fig. 3A). Degradation of cytosolic IκBα during ER stress may explain the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 3A). Nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB was further confirmed by immunofluorescence in ML-1 cells and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3B). Two forms of NF-κB complexes were detected with gel shift analysis, and the upper gel-shifted band of NF-κB DNA binding activity was strongly induced at 1.5 and 3 h after ER stress (Fig. 3C). Anti-p65 antibody supershifted the upper gel-shifted band but did not affect the lower gelshifted band. In contrast, anti-p50 antibody supershifted the lower gel-shifted band completely, and partly decreased the intensity of the upper gel-shifted band. Control anti-c-Jun antibody did not affect the NF-κB DNA binding activity. Therefore, the lower gel-shifted band may consist of p50/p50 homodimer only, and the upper gel-shifted band may contain both p65/p65 homodimer and p65/p50 heterodimer. Activation of NF-κB appe"
https://openalex.org/W2032410468,"Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is cytoplasmic and structurally related to guanine-nucleotide free chaperones. TCTP (also called histamine-releasing factor) has been described previously as a secreted protein that participates in inflammatory responses by promoting the release of histamine. How TCTP is eventually exported out of the cell to promote such activities is unknown. Here we show that TCTP secretion was insensitive to either brefeldin A or monensin, suggesting that it proceeds via an endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-independent or nonclassical pathway. Moreover, our analyses also suggest that secreted TCTP originates from pre-existing pools. TSAP6, a p53-inducible 5–6 transmembrane protein, was found to interact with TCTP in a yeast two-hybrid hunt. GST pull down assays confirmed their direct interaction, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed their partial co-distribution to vesicular-like structures at the plasma membrane and around the nucleus. Functionally, the overexpression of TSAP6 consistently leads to enhanced secretion of both endogenously and exogenously expressed TCTP. Finally, we found TCTP in preparations of small secreted vesicles called exosomes, which have been suggested as a possible pathway for nonclassical secretion. Overexpression of TSAP6 also increased TCTP levels in exosome preparations. Altogether, these data identify a novel role for TSAP6 in the export of TCTP and indicate that this multipass membrane protein could have a general role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking and secretion.

Amino acid sequence analyses suggest that these proteins have 5–6 putative transmembrane regions and, with the exception of STEAP, also possess an NH2-terminal GXGXX(G/A) motif, a signature sequence for the core Rossman fold.

Furthermore, time-lapse imaging of GFP-STAMPl in COS cells demonstrated its anterograde-retrograde trafficking to and from the Golgi complex in the form of vesicular tubular structures (8Korkmaz K.S.

Taken together, these data suggest that TSAP6-related proteins could be involved in vesicular trafficking and secretory processes (7Moldes M. Lasnier F. Gauthereau X. Klein C. Pairault J. Feve B.

Previously, we reported that TSAP6 associated with Nix, a pro-apoptotic protein, and Myt1 kinase, a regulator of the G2/M transition (3Passer B.J. Nancy-Portebois V. Amzallag N. Prieur S. Cans C. Roborel de Climens A. Fiucci G. Bouvard V. Tuynder M. Susini L. Morchoisne S. Crible V. Lespagnol A. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we proposed that TSAP6 could amplify an apoptotic signal by cooperating with Nix and, furthermore, that TSAP6 could delay the G2/M transition of the cell cycle by maintaining Myt1 kinase in its active form. It seems that TSAP6 can promote different types of activities that are related to apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, or vesicular trafficking. In the present study, TSAP6 was used as a “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid hunt and identified TCTP as an interactor. TCTP was initially described in sarcoma ascites tumor cells as having a serum-inducible mRNA whose expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels (9Yenofsky R. Cereghini S. Krowczynska A. Brawerman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Bohm H. Benndorf R. Gaestel M. Gross B. Nurnberg P. Kraft R. Otto A.

Gaestel M. Bommer U.A. Ryffel G. Bielka H. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 1193-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that TCTP is a tubulin-binding protein that associates with microtubules in a cell cycle-dependent fashion (13Gachet Y. Tournier S. Lee M. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Poulton T. Bommer U.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance, polo-like kinase was shown to interact directly with and phosphorylate TCTP, further implicating TCTP in cell cycle-related activities (14Yarm F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6209-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). More recently, NMR analysis revealed that TCTP has a structural homology with the mammalian suppressor of Sec4 (MSS4/DSS4), a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide-free chaperone (15Thaw P. Baxter N.J. Hounslow A.M. Price C. Waltho J.P. Craven C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In line with these findings, we recently identified a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity for TCTP (16Cans C. Passer B.J. Shalak V. Nancy-Portebois V. Crible V. Amzallag N. Allanic D.

Furthermore, TCTP was identified in a high throughput screening, while searching for differentially expressed genes between tumor cells and their revertant counterparts (17Tuynder M. Susini L. Prieur S. Besse S. Fiucci G. Amson R. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14976-14981Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that TCTP was significantly down-regulated in tumor revertant cells, which have a suppressed malignant phenotype. In agreement, knockdown of TCTP by small interfering RNA in breast cancer cells resulted in the striking reappearance of ductal-like structures reminiscent of normal ones. Moreover, TCTP protein levels were clearly augmented in a variety of human tumor tissues as compared with their normal tissue controls (17Tuynder M. Susini L. Prieur S. Besse S. Fiucci G. Amson R. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14976-14981Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies suggest that perturbations of TCTP expression levels could have different consequences on cell growth related activities. Extracellularly, TCTP was initially isolated as a secreted factor from U937-derived cultured supernatants based on its ability to promote histamine release (18MacDonald S.M. Rafnar T. Langdon J. Lichtenstein L.M. Science. 1995; 269: 688-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies confirmed that indeed TCTP is a secreted protein implicated in immune responses. TCTP has been shown to trigger the release of histamine from eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells and was also found to be a potent stimulus for interleukin-4 and interleukin-8 production (19Schroeder J.T. Lichtenstein L.M. MacDonald S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1265-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Teshima S. Rokutan K. Nikawa T. Kishi K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6356-6366PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TCTP was shown to have a B-cell stimulating activity (21Kang H.S. Lee M.J. Song H. Han S.H. Kim Y.M. Im J.Y. Choi I. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6545-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Under allergic conditions, TCTP was detected in nasal and skin blister fluids from patients with late phase allergic inflammation (22MacDonald S.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and in bronchoalveolar lavages from patients with idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (23Yoneda K. Rokutan K. Nakamura Y. Yanagawa H. Kondo-Teshima S. Sone S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L174-L181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, homologs of TCTP from the parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma mansoni have been detected in the plasma of infected hosts (24MacDonald S.M. Bhisutthibhan J. Shapiro T.A. Rogerson S.J. Taylor T.E. Tembo M. Langdon J.M. Meshnick S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10829-10832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Rao K.V. Chen L. Gnanasekar M.

The presence of both malarial and schistosome TCTP in infected hosts has been suggested to contribute to inflammatory responses and possibly to parasitic dissemination (25Rao K.V. Chen L.

Although the role of secreted TCTP is well documented, how TCTP is eventually exported out of the cell is unknown. Here we attempt to elucidate the secretory pathway of TCTP and the potential role of TSAP6 in this process. Reagents—Anti-TCTP and anti-eEF1Bβ antibodies were raised in rabbits after injection of the full-length proteins as reported previously (16Cans C. Passer B.J. Shalak V. Nancy-Portebois V. Crible V.

Anti-β-tubulin (H-235), anti-TSG101 (M-19), anti-actin (I-19), anti-presenilin-1 (H-70), and anti-galectin-3 (D-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HA, anti-GP96, anti-clathrin, and anti-SEAP (Ab8188) were obtained from Babco, Stressgen, BD Biosciences, and Abcam, respectively. The anti-MHC class I (HC10 and HCA2) was obtained from ATCC and kindly provided by P. Benaroch. Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were purchased from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were purchased from ICN. HA-TSAP6 was cloned as described previously (3Passer B.J. Nancy-Portebois V. Amzallag N. Prieur S. Cans C. Roborel de Climens A. Fiucci G. Bouvard V.

The vector containing the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was purchased from Clontech. Secretion Assays—293T (5 × 106) cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 8 ml of serum-free media for 3 h. Thereafter, 4 ml of supernatants were collected and centrifuged (300 × g) for 10 min to remove nonadherent cells; thereafter, supernatants were centrifuged a second time (5000 × g) for 10 min to remove cell debris and nuclei. Supernatants were concentrated (80×) by centrifugation using Amicon-Ultra, 4 units (10,000 molecular weight cut-off), and resuspended in a 2× SDS sample buffer. 15 μl of each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors, and 1 μg of total proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer, membranes were routinely blotted for TCTP, eEF1Bβ, β-tubulin, and actin to monitor the extent of cytosolic contamination because of either unspecific protein release or cell lysis. For cycloheximide (CHX) experiments, the indicated hours correspond to the total time of treatment with CHX including the 3-h secretion time. For all time points, CHX was added at 10 μg/ml, except for the time point 18 h where 1 μg/ml CHX was added. For each experiment, cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Transfections—For transfection experiments, 293T (2.5 × 106) or HepG2 (1 × 106) cells were plated the day before transfection. Cells were transfected by the Ca2PO4 precipitation method using a total of 40 μg of plasmid (HA-TSAP6:YFP-TCTP, 3:1) and secretion assays were performed the following day. For some experiments, brefeldin A (5 μm) or monensin (25 μm) was added 30 min or 2 h, respectively, prior to and during the 3-h secretion assay. K562 cells (4 × 106) were electroporated (GenePulser Xcel, Bio-Rad) (180 V, 20 ms, square-wave pulse) with a total of 16 μg of plasmid DNA (HA-TSAP6:YFP-TCTP, 3:1). Cells were allowed to recover in complete media for 2 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were layered on a Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) cushion, and viable cells were isolated from the interface after centrifugation at 900 × g for 20 min. Approximately 30% transfection efficiency was achieved as determined by transfection with a green fluorescent protein control plasmid. The following day, secretion assays were performed as described above. Exosome Preparations—Exosomes were purified as described previously from supernatants of either the Dl cell line, bone marrow dendritic cells (24-h secretion assay), or 293T cells (3-h secretion assay) by 100,000 × g centrifugation followed by a wash of the exosome pellet in a large volume of phosphate-buffered saline (26Wubbolts R.

A linear sucrose gradient (2–0.25 m) was layered on top of the exosome suspension and centrifuged for 15 h at 100,000 × g in a SW41 rotor. One-ml fractions were collected, and the sucrose density was measured with a refractometer. Fractions were diluted in 2 ml of Hepes buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a TLA100.4 rotor, and pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In Vivo Protein Labeling—For pulse-chase experiments, 8 × 107 293T cells cultured overnight under standard conditions were collected in a tube and subsequently starved of methionine for 1 h prior to metabolic labeling with 1 mCi of Redivue [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). After labeling for 1 h, cells were extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline and placed in 5.5 ml of serum-free media supplemented with 1 mm nonradioactive methionine for secretion assays that corresponded to the indicated times of chase. At each time point, 1 ml of the cell suspension (∼1.5 × 107 cells) was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was lysed in lysis buffer. Precleared lysates and supernatants were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-TCTP followed by incubation with protein-G-agarose beads (Promega). For the IgG control, cell lysates were incubated with rabbit IgG plus protein-G-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitations were extensively washed in lysis buffer and resolved on a SDS-PAGE. Radioactive material was visualized by autoradiography. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Full-length human TSAP6 was fused with the LexA DNA-binding domain in pEG202. A cDNA library derived from the murine LTR6 cell line incubated at 32 °C for 4 h was cloned into the galactose-inducible pYESTrp2 vector (Invitrogen) containing the B42 activation domain. The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as described previously (3Passer B.J. Nancy-Portebois V. Amzallag N. Prieur S. Cans C. Roborel de Climens A. Fiucci G. Bouvard V. Tuynder M. Susini L. Morchoisne S. Crible V. Lespagnol A. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Finley R.J. Brent R.

Briefly, the yeast strain RFY231 (MATα trp1Δ::hisGhis3ura3-1 leu2::3Lexop-LEU2) harboring pEG202-TSAP6 and the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34 was transformed by the lithium acetate method with the LTR6 cDNA library. Approximately 1 × 106 yeast colonies were obtained. Yeast containing potential TSAP6 interactors, were identified by simultaneous growth and β-galactosidase activity on galactose Ura-His-Trp-Leu- selection plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Yeast mating assays were performed as described (3Passer B.J. Nancy-Portebois V. Amzallag N. Prieur S. Cans C. Roborel de Climens A. Fiucci G. Bouvard V. Tuynder M. Susini L. Morchoisne S. Crible V.

Colwill K. Harper S. Pawson T. Anderson S.K. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST-TCTP and GST-NKTR fusion proteins were produced in the bacterial strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) by inducing protein expression with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C. After lysis of bacteria, GST fusion proteins were subsequently captured on glutathione-agarose beads. [35S]Methionine/cysteine-labeled proteins were made in vitro by using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation (IVT) system (Promega) and added to the GST fusion proteins in lysis buffer. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the bead-bound complexes were washed and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Two-color Immunofluorescence Analysis—293T, HepG2, and HeLa cells fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%) were stained with chicken anti-TSAP6 and rabbit anti-TCTP antibodies followed by incubation with anti-chicken AlexaFluor-488 (green) and anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-594 (red) coupled secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence staining imaging was performed sequentially for each wavelength by using a Leica TCS4D confocal microscope. In case of HeLa cells, immunofluorescence imaging was performed by wide-field deconvolution microscopy using an Olympus CellR system. Endogenous TCTP Is Exported via a Nonclassical Pathway from 293T Cells—Although it is well established that TCTP is a secreted protein, how it is exported is unknown. Thus, we initially carried out studies to characterize the route of export of TCTP. 293T cells were incubated in serum-free media either for 0, 0.5, 3, or 5 h, and supernatants were concentrated (see “Experimental Procedures”), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for TCTP (Fig. 1A). By 3 h, TCTP was detected in 293T cell-derived supernatants at a level that was not further enhanced by 5 h (data not shown). The quantification of secreted TCTP was estimated by Western blot using a range of recombinant TCTP as a reference (supplemental Fig. S1). We estimated that the secreted TCTP in our 3-h assay represents ∼0.3% of the total intracellular TCTP. To ensure that supernatants containing TCTP resulted from an active process of secretion rather than contamination because of cell lysis or unspecific release, supernatants were also immunoblotted against a panel of antibodies that recognize abundant cytosolic proteins. Immunoblot analysis clearly identified β-tubulin, elongation factor-1 Bβ (eEF1Bβ), and actin (data not shown) in cell lysates, at a level of expression comparable with TCTP, but not in the corresponding supernatants. These data indicate that TCTP can be readily detected in supernatants of 293T cells using a relatively short assay period of secretion with minimal effects of cell lysis. Soluble secreted proteins typically follow one of two routes of cellular export. The majority of secreted proteins translocates via an ER/Golgi-dependent pathway that can be blocked by brefeldin A or monensin, classical inhibitors of ER/Golgi trafficking (30Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). By contrast, a number of exported proteins are insensitive to these inhibitors and are consequently secreted independently of the ER/Golgi (31Nickel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To address whether TCTP is dependent on the ER/Golgi pathway for export, 293T cells were treated with either brefeldin A or monensin, cultured in serum-free media for 3 h, and their supernatants subsequently analyzed for the presence of TCTP. Fig. 1B shows that neither brefeldin A nor monensin perturbed the secretion of TCTP, whereas these inhibitors completely abrogated the secretion of overexpressed SEAP, an ER/Golgi-dependently secreted protein. Thus, these data indicate that the secretion of TCTP proceeds via an ER/Golgi-independent route. Next, we addressed whether secreted TCTP in our assay represented newly synthesized proteins or, alternatively, a pre-existing pool. First, pulse-chase experiments were performed wherein 293T cells were metabolically radiolabeled for 1 h and chased in serum-free media for 0–16 h (Fig. 1C). At the end of each period, TCTP was immunoprecipitated from both the cell lysates and from the corresponding supernatants and analyzed by autoradiography. Although TCTP was detected in the lysates throughout the chase period, its appearance in the supernatants was clearly visible only by 16 h of chase. In cell lysates, the levels of TCTP appeared to diminish by 16 h of chase, which was accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of TCTP in the supernatants. Next, we repeated the 3-h secretion assay, but in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) (Fig. 1D). Even by 8 h of treatment with CHX, the levels of secreted TCTP was not perturbed. Levels of secreted TCTP diminished when the time of treatment with CHX exceeded its half-life, which is about 16 h (see Fig. 1C). These results indicate that TCTP has a relatively long half-life and that the majority of secreted TCTP detected in our assay does not represent newly synthesized proteins but rather comes from a pre-existing pool of TCTP. TSAP6 Interacts with TCTP and They Co-distribute—TCTP was identified in a yeast two-hybrid hunt using TSAP6 as a bait. An association between LexA-TSAP6 and B42-TCTP was verified by yeast mating assays (Fig. 2A). This analysis shows that by day 4, growth and β-gal activity were observed on galact"
https://openalex.org/W2097055679,"A key feature in the molecular pathogenesis of liver fibrosis requires maintenance of the activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) phenotype by both proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. We provide evidence that leptin is a potent HSC mitogen and dramatically inhibits stellate cell apoptosis. Leptin proved to be as potent an HSC mitogen as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in isolated primary HSCs; data using fluorescent propidium iodide (PI) uptake revealed that leptin, like PDGF, increased HSC populations in the S- and G2/M-phases of the cell cycle. Leptin resulted in a robust increase in cyclin D1 expression. Using the chemical inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) activity, AG 490, and overexpression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), we show that blockade of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) phosphorylation blocks leptin-induced HSC proliferation. Leptin-associated phosphorylation of both extracellular regulated kinase (p44/p42, Erk) and Akt is also prohibited. Further, the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 and MAPK inhibitor PD98059 were found to significantly reduce leptin-induced HSC proliferation, thereby indicating that leptin induced HSC proliferation is Akt- and Erk-dependent. Akt was also protective against HSC apoptosis. Leptin abolished both cycloheximide-induced and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis, demonstrated by reduced caspase-3 activity, HSC-TUNEL staining, and DNA fragmentation. We conclude that leptin acts as a direct hepatic stellate cell survival agonist. Importantly, we have demonstrated that leptin-induced HSC proliferation and survival by Ob-Rb phosphorylation are both Erk- and Akt-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2127170482,"We have previously demonstrated that STAT-1 plays a critical role in promoting apoptotic cell death in cardiac myocytes following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major constituent of green tea, has recently been reported to inhibit STAT-1 activity in noncardiac cells. In the present study, we have assessed the protective effects of EGCG and green tea extract (GTE) infusion on both cultures of cardiac myocytes and the isolated rat heart. EGCG reduced STAT-1 phosphorylation and protected cardiac myocytes against I/R-induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, EGCG reduced the expression of a known STAT-1 pro-apoptotic target gene, Fas receptor. More interestingly, oral administration of GTE as well as EGCG infusion limited the extent of infarct size and attenuated the magnitude of myocyte apoptosis in the isolated rat heart exposed to I/R injury. This reduction cell death was associated with improved hemodynamic recovery and ventricular function in the ischemic/reperfused rat heart. This is the first report to show that consumption of green tea is able to mediate cardioprotection and enhance cardiac function during I/R injury. Because GTE-mediated cardioprotection is achieved, at least in part, through inhibition of STAT-1 activity, we may postulate that a similar action can be implemented in the clinical setting to minimize STAT-1 activation levels in patients with acute coronary artery disease (CAD)."

ABC transporters have been subdivided into full and half transporters; full transporters contain two ATP-binding domains and two multitransmembrane domains, each typically containing six transmembrane α-helices. In contrast, half transporters contain one ATP-binding cassette and one transmembrane domain and must dimerize to form a functional pump (4Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Abelson J.N. Simon M.I.

ABC transporters are further subdivided into seven groups, ABCA through ABCG. Members of the ABCG subtype (ABCG1, ABCG2, ABCG3, ABCG4, ABCG5, ABCG8, and Drosophila white, brown, and scarlet) are unique in that the ATP-binding cassette of these half transporters is at the amino terminus and the transmembrane domains are at the carboxyl terminus of the protein.

However, no mammalian homologues of Drosophila brown or scarlet that might function as the heterodimeric partner of ABCG1 have been identified. The mammalian ABCG4 protein has 94% amino acid identity with ABCG1, consistent with gene duplication (16Annilo T. Tammur J. Hutchinson A. Rzhetsky A. Dean M. Allikmets R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 94: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Oldfield S. Lowry C. Ruddick J. Lightman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1591: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, ABCG4 expression is reported to be limited to the brain and eye (17Oldfield S. Lowry C. Ruddick J. Lightman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1591: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and this would preclude the formation of obligate ABCG1/ABCG4 functional heterodimers in many tissues. In an attempt to determine the function for mammalian ABCG1, Klucken et al. (18Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Liebisch G. Kapinsky M. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Dean M. Allikmets R. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) treated human macrophages with antisense oligonucleotides to ABCG1. This treatment resulted in decreased expression of a protein of 110 kDa and decreased efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to HDL3 (18Klucken J. Buchler C. Orso E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Liebisch G. Kapinsky M. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Dean M. Allikmets R. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the antisense oligonucleotides also decreased apoE secretion from macrophages (19Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The mammalian ABCG1 cDNA was originally identified from studies using degenerate PCR and RNA from either a murine macrophage cell line (10Savary S. Denizot F. Luciani M. Mattei M. Chimini G. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a murine pre-B cell library (11Croop J.M. Tiller G.E. Fletcher J.A. Lux M.L. Raab E. Goldenson D. Son D. Arciniegas S. Wu R.L.

Chakravarti A. Perrin G. Antonarakis S.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 66-75PubMed Google Scholar). These murine and human cDNAs had 97 and 87% identity at the amino acid and nucleic acid levels, respectively. In general, high expression of ABCG1 mRNA was noted in spleen, lung, thymus, and brain, whereas expression in kidney, liver, and heart was low or undetectable (10Savary S. Denizot F. Luciani M. Mattei M. Chimini G. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Croop J.M. Tiller G.E. Fletcher J.A. Lux M.L. Raab E. Goldenson D. Son D. Arciniegas S. Wu R.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that murine ABCG1 mRNA levels were highly induced when macrophages were either incubated with LXR agonists or were converted to cholesterol ester-loaded foam cells (18Klucken J.

Recently, we and others identified multiple human ABCG1 transcripts that are produced as a result of transcriptional initiation at different exons and alternative mRNA splicing (23Langmann T.

Each of the resulting mRNAs has a unique 5′ sequence upstream of exons 11–23 (20Chen H. Rossier C. Lalioti M.D. Lynn A. Chakravarti A. Perrin G. Antonarakis S.E. Am. J. Hum.

Each unique upstream sequence contains an in-frame ATG, resulting in the synthesis of multiple putative protein isoforms that contain variable amino termini of 56–203 amino acids and a conserved 583 amino acids at their carboxyl termini (24Lorkowski S.

Edwards, unpublished data. It is not known whether such variations at the amino terminus affect protein localization, dimerization, or function. In contrast to the multiple human isoforms, only a single murine ABCG1 cDNA has been identified to date. The LXR response element (LXRE) (27Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) that is presumed to be necessary for the activation of the murine gene by LXR/RXR has yet to be identified. In the current study we report on the identification of new exons and novel mRNAs that encode three putative ABCG1 protein isoforms. In addition, we identify multiple LXREs within an intron of the Abcg1 gene. Promoter-reporter studies suggest that these LXREs are necessary and sufficient to activate the gene in numerous tissues in response to LXR ligands. In situ hybridization studies show that ABCG1 is expressed at relatively high levels in the olfactory bulb epithelium, hind brain, hippocampus, choroid plexus, eye, and dorsal root ganglia of developing embryos and/or adults. Finally, we show that each ABCG1 isoform stimulates the efflux of cholesterol to HDL. These data suggest that ABCG1 may play a key role in regulating lipid efflux from neurons and epithelial cells in addition to macrophages.

Hek293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and plated in 24-well plates (0.3 × 106 cells/ml) and allowed to adhere overnight. We used LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) to transiently transfect triplicate wells of Hek293 cells with the empty pCMX vector (1 μg/well) or the pCMX vector containing a cDNA encoding a specific ABCG1 isoform. Analysis of cells transfected with plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein and pCMX indicated that the transfection efficiency was >70%. Cholesterol Efflux—Following transfection of Hek293 cells with the indicated plasmids, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 24 h in media A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.2% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with an acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitor (58-035, 2 μg/ml) (32Kritharides L.

The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for an additional 4 h in media A and where indicated, T0901317 and LG100153. After this equilibration period, the cells were washed twice more with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for an additional 4 h in media A or in media A supplemented with either HDL3 (50 μg/ml) or total HDL (50 μg/ml). Media were removed and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and the radioactivity in the supernatant determined as described (33Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12097-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Isopropanol was added to each well to solubilize cell-associated radioactivity. After 24 h, aliquots were removed and the cell-associated radioactivity determined (33Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12097-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Cholesterol efflux was determined by dividing the radioactive content of the media by the sum of the radioactivity in the cells and media. Efflux was linear for >8 h. 5′-RACE—5′-RACE was performed using cDNA from Sure-RACE™ Multi-Tissue RACE panels (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An adaptor containing sequences complimentary to two primers, ADP1 and ADP2, was attached to the 5′ end of the cDNAs. First round PCR was performed with a gene specific primer (GSP1) corresponding to exon 4 of the mouse gene and ADP1 under following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min, 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and 15 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, then extension at 72 °C for 6 min. The first round PCR products were diluted 10-fold, and an aliquot was used as template for second round PCR with nested primers GSP2 and ADP2 under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, extension at 72 °C for 6 min. The PCR products were separated on agarose gels and recovered fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Isolation of Murine Peritoneal Macrophages—Murine peritoneal macrophages were isolated as described (34Mak P.A. Laffitte B.A. Desrumaux C. Joseph S.B. Curtiss L.K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P.

Briefly, 1 ml of 4% thioglycolate was injected intraperitoneally into 12- to 16-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. Four days after the injection, macrophages were isolated and plated on 100-mm dishes at 1.2 million cells/ml. Isolated macrophages were allowed to adhere for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum and 100 μm mevalonic acid. Cells were treated with either 1 μm T0901317 and 100 nm LG100153 or Me2SO for 24 h followed by RNA isolation. RNA Isolation and Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed as described (35Zhang Y. Kast-Woelbern H.R. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the primers and probes are given in Table I. Probes were modified at the 5′ end with 6-carboxyfluorescein and at the 3′ end with 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (Integrated DNA Technology, Coralville, IA). EMSAs—EMSAs were performed as described (29Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

In Situ Hybridization of Embryos—In situ hybridization was performed as described (37Hogan B.L.M. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Briefly, a 905-bp fragment, corresponding to 725 bp of the 3′-UTR and 180 bp of the open reading frame of the murine ABCG1 cDNA, was subcloned into pCI-Neo (Promega) to generate pCI-Neo-mABCG1. The linearized plasmid was transcribed with either T7 or T3 RNA polymerase using the (digoxigenin)-UTP labeling kit (Roche Applied Science), to generate sense or antisense digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes. For whole mount in situ hybridization, embryos were dissected at embryonic day 11.5 and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. For in situ hybridization of embryo sections, embryos were dissected at embryonic day 12.5 or embryonic day 15.5, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (10.24% polyvinyl alcohol, 4.26% w/w polyethylene glycol) (VWR, West Chester, PA), and stored at –20 °C. Twenty-μm cryosections (or the whole mount embryos) were hybridized with the indicated probe for 18 h at 68 °C prior to addition of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin. The sections then incubated in BM-Purple (Roche Applied Science) for 48 h to allow for color development. Identification of ABCG1 Transcripts That Encode Novel Isoforms—A single murine ABCG1 cDNA was originally reported by Savary et al. and Croop et al. (10Savary S. Denizot F. Luciani M. Mattei M. Chimini G. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Croop J.M. Tiller G.E. Fletcher J.A. Lux M.L. Raab E. Goldenson D. Son D. Arciniegas S. Wu R.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For comparative purposes, we refer to this transcript, corresponding to exons 1 and 2–15, as ABCG1-a (Fig. 1). To determine whether additional murine ABCG1 transcripts are produced, we used 5′-RACE to analyze cDNAs derived from multiple tissues. The approach, described in detail under “Materials and Methods,” utilized cDNAs that contained a unique adapter at the 5′ end. These cDNAs were used as templates for PCR reactions, utilizing primers corresponding to the 5′ linker and to exon 4. Nested PCR reactions were subsequently performed utilizing internal primers corresponding to the linker and exon 4, and the resulting DNA products were cloned and sequenced. Many clones contained sequences with 100% identity to exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 and thus presumably corresponded to transcript ABCG1-a (data not shown). However, one cDNA, derived from the spleen library, contained a novel 220-bp sequence upstream of exon 2. Comparison of the novel sequence with genomic DNA databases indicated that all 220 bps were present in two new exons (exons 1A and 1B in Fig. 1A) that were localized 3′ of exon 1. The novel transcript, containing sequences corresponding to exons 1A + 1B + 2–15, is referred to as ABCG1-b (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, we utilized spleen RNA as a template to generate full-length cDNA using primers to exon 15 and either exon 1 or exon 1A. As expected, this approach resulted in the generation of cDNAs corresponding to ABCG1-a and ABCG1-b (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, a third cDNA was isolated that corresponded to a transcript containing exon 1A fused to exons 2–15 (ABCG1-c in Fig. 1B). The 5′ sequences of these three transcripts are shown in Fig. 1C. Previous studies (10Savary S. Denizot F. Luciani M. Mattei M. Chimini G. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Croop J.M. Tiller G.E. Fletcher J.A. Lux M.L. Raab E. Goldenson D. Son D. Arciniegas S. Wu R.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) identified an in-frame methionine in exon 1 of the ABCG1-a transcript (Fig. 1, B and C). Translation initiated at this methionine would produce a protein containing 666 amino acids (Fig. 1B). In contrast, ABCG1-b and ABCG1-c lack exon 1, but contain an in-frame methionine in exon 1A; translation initiated at this methionine would generate proteins containing either 714 or 682 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1B). Thus, proteins derived from translation of the three mRNAs are predicted to contain an identical carboxyl terminus of 652 amino acids (encoded by exons 2–15) but to differ at their amino termini (Fig. 1, B and C). Comparison of Murine and Human ABCG1 Genomic Organization—We performed comparative studies of murine and human genomic DNA to identify conserved exonic sequences. These studies utilized VISTA and various exon predicting programs (including MZEF, GENIE, GRAIL 1, GRAIL2, GRAIL 1A, FGENE, and GENESCAN). The results indicate a very high degree of conservation between the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of exons 1 and 2–15 of the murine gene and exons 5, 7, and 11–23 of the human gene (Fig. 2). However, nucleotide sequences corresponding to the novel murine exons 1A and 1B w"

We studied IGF-I mediated signaling in embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons express IGF-I receptors (IGF-IR), and IGF-I activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. High glucose exposure induces apoptosis, which is inhibited by IGF-I through the PI3K/Akt pathway. IGF-I stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway phosphorylates three known Akt effectors: the survival transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the pro-apoptotic effector proteins glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and forkhead (FKHR). IGF-I regulates survival at the nuclear level through accumulation of phospho-Akt in DRG neuronal nuclei, increased CREB-mediated transcription, and nuclear exclusion of FKHR. High glucose increases expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl protein Bim (a transcriptional target of FKHR). However, IGF-I does not regulate Bim or anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein expression levels, which suggests that IGF-I neuroprotection is not through regulation of their expression. High glucose also induces loss of the initiator caspase-9 and increases caspase-3 cleavage, effects blocked by IGF-I. These data suggest that IGF-I prevents apoptosis in DRG neurons by regulating PI3K/Akt pathway effectors, including GSK-3beta, CREB, and FKHR, and by blocking caspase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1976409519,"Some membrane-permeable antagonists restore cell surface expression of misfolded receptors retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are therefore termed pharmacochaperones. Whether pharmacochaperones increase protein stability, thereby preventing rapid degradation, or assist folding via direct receptor interactions or interfere with quality control components remains elusive. We now show that the cell surface expression and function (binding of the agonist) of the mainly ER-retained wild-type murine vasopressin V2 receptor GFP fusion protein (mV2R·GFP) is restored by the vasopressin receptor antagonists SR49059 and SR121463B with EC50 values similar to their KD values. This effect was preserved when protein synthesis was abolished. In addition, SR121463B rescued eight mutant human V2Rs (hV2Rs, three are responsible for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) characterized by amino acid exchanges at the C-terminal end of transmembrane helix TM I and TM VII. In contrast, mutants with amino acid exchanges at the interface of TM II and IV were not rescued by either antagonist.

In X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), the kidney shows a resistance to the action of AVP, caused by inactivating mutations of the human V2R (hV2R) gene (2Rosenthal W. Seibold A.

More than 150 different mutations have been described (for review, see Ref. 3Oksche A. Rosenthal W. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), 50% of which are missense mutations resulting in the substitution of a single amino acid. Most of the hV2R mutants with a single amino acid exchange are retained within the ER and not transported to the cell surface (for review, see Ref. 3Oksche A. Rosenthal W. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most likely, the amino acid exchanges result in improper folding of the mutant hV2Rs and subsequently prolonged association with molecular chaperones. For example, for the NDI mutant hR337X, a prolonged association with the ER-chaperone calnexin has been observed (4Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Petäjä-Repo U.E. Laperriere A. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Nabi I.R. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6766-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Chaperone association prevents the aggregation of misfolded proteins, but also inhibits the exit of improperly folded proteins from the ER until correct folding is established. Recently, it has been found that membrane-permeable antagonists not only inhibit receptor activation, but also promote cell surface expression of misfolded, ER-retained G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This concept represents an intriguing new approach for the therapy of congenital diseases caused by mutations in genes encoding GPCRs. For the ER-retained rhodopsin mutant P23H (a frequent cause of autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa), it has been shown in vitro that the inverse agonist 9-cis-retinal or the non-hydrolyzable inverse agonist 11-cis-7-ring-retinal promoted cell surface expression (5Saliba R.S.

Restoration of cell surface expression by antagonists or inverse agonists has also been found for various mutants of the hV2R (7Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F.

Metab. 2002; 87: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which antagonists or inverse agonists promote cell surface delivery remain elusive. Antagonists may act on misfolded proteins by increasing protein stability, e.g. inhibiting their rapid degradation or by preventing misfolding and aggregation of the nascent proteins. Alternatively, although less likely, hydrophobic pharmacochaperones could interfere with components of the quality control system. To explore the mechanisms by which antagonists rescue intracellularly retained GPCRs, we used the wild-type murine V2R (mV2R), which is predominantly retained within the ER as an immature protein (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the hV2R is mainly located within the plasma membrane as a complex glycosylated protein. These differences are caused by a variant amino acid at the junction of the second transmembrane domain and the first extracellular loop (lysine 100 in hV2R, aspartate 100 in mV2R, Ref. 9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We show here that antagonists increase the conformational stability of the mV2R at a post-translational level via direct interactions. Antagonist-mediated cell surface delivery was also found for a subset of mutant hV2Rs, which showed amino acid exchanges at the C-terminal end of transmembrane regions TM I and TM VII. In contrast, mutant hV2Rs with amino acid exchanges at the interface of TM II and TM IV did not show antagonist-mediated cell surface delivery, most likely because of more severe folding defects. The mechanisms involved in successful antagonist-mediated restoration of cell surface delivery are explained in a three-dimensional homology model of the antagonist-bound hV2R. Materials—Trypsin, cycloheximide, and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherlands), puromycin, BQ788, BQ123, and G418 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Bad Soden, Germany), BQ123 was from Alexis (Läufelfingen, Switzerland), trypan blue from Seromed (Berlin, Germany), EZ-Link TM Sulfo-NHS Biotin and NeutrAvidin beads from Pierce, the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany), and FuGENE 6 from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). Fetal calf serum was from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). All other reagents were from Sigma. [3H]AVP (68.5 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Rodgau, Germany). The vasopressin V2 and V1 receptor-selective antagonists SR121463B and SR49059 were kindly provided by Dr. C. Serradeil-LeGal (Sanofi Synthelabo, Montepellier, France). Plasmids—The plasmids encoding mV2R·CFP and mV2R·YFP fusion proteins are derivatives of the plasmid mV2R·GFP described previously (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Plasmids pcDNA3·V2R and pmV2R·A3 encoding the wild-type hV2R and mV2R were also described previously (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,10Oksche A. Dehe M. Schülein R. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding wild-type and dominant-negative dynamin I were kindly provided by Dr. S. Schmid (La Jolla, CA) and plasmids ER·CFP, Endo·YFP, and Mem·YFP were from BD Biosciences. The plasmids encoding the mutant hV2Rs (hL62P, hΔLAR62–64, hH80R, hW164R, hK100D, hD136A, hS167L, hS167T, hC319Y, hP322S, hW323H, hF328A, hD368K/S371X) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the plasmids pcDNA3·V2R and phV2R·GFP. The sequence of all plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing using the FS Dye Terminator kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The nucleotide sequences of oligonucleotides used are available upon request. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Transient transfection was carried out with LipofectAMINE or with FuGENE 6 essentially as described (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,11Gregan B. Jürgensen J. Papsdorf G. Furkert J. Schaefer M. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. Oksche A. J. Biol.

For co-transfections of plasmids encoding the mV2R or the hV2R mutants with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant dynamin, the ratio of DNA was 0.7/0.3. In all experiments cells were analyzed 16–48 h after transfection. Incubation of Cells with Non-peptide Antagonists—The effects of the non-peptide antagonists SR121463B and SR49059 were studied in LSM, biotinylation, immunoblotting, and [3H]AVP binding experiments. If not described otherwise, cells were incubated 6 h after transient transfection with SR121463B and SR49059 (both at 1 μm) for additional 16 h. SR49059-treated cells were washed twice with KRH (125 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 22 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes) for 2 min at 4 °C or 37 °C and then further investigated. For the inhibition of protein synthesis HEK293 cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide or 10 μg/ml puromycin for 30 min or 2 h prior to the treatment with SR49059 or SR121463B (both at a final concentration of 1 μm) for up to 6 h. Immunoblots and Cell Surface Biotinylation Experiments—Preparation of membranes of HEK293 cells transiently expressing the mV2R or mutant hV2Rs and the procedure for immunoblotting were as described previously (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell surface biotinylation experiments were performed as described previously (12Hermosilla R. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293 cells transiently expressing GFP fusion proteins grown on 60-mm Petri dishes were incubated with sulfo-NHS-biotin in PBS (0.5 mg/ml, 30 min, 4 °C). The reaction was terminated with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS (10 min, 4 °C). Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8.0; 1 h, 4 °C). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min, 20,000 × g). Biotinylated proteins were precipitated with NeutrAvidin-agarose beads (3 min, 17,000 × g), and finally solubilized with Laemmli buffer. Biotinylated V2R·GFP was detected in immunoblots with polyclonal GFP antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies as described (12Hermosilla R. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). [3H]AVP Binding Experiments with Membrane Preparations and with Intact Cells—[3H]AVP binding experiments with intact HEK293 cells were essentially performed as described (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, cells treated without or with SR49059 were washed twice with ice-cold KRH, pH 7.4 for 1 min followed by an incubation with [3H]AVP in PBS in the absence (total binding) or presence of 10 μm unlabeled AVP (unspecific binding) at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing and lysis with 0.1 nm NaOH, radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. In control experiments, we verified that this procedure was sufficient to remove SR49059 from the mV2R and the hV2R completely. However, in the case of SR121463B treatment, different washing procedures including high and low salt buffers with different pH values (ranging from pH 6.8 to 2.5) removed only a small and invariable fraction (<10%) of the antagonist from the mV2R and hV2R. The procedure for membrane preparation of transiently transfected HEK293 or primary-cultured inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells and [3H]AVP binding experiments with membrane preparations were carried out as described previously (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm sodium cacodylate/100 mm sucrose for 20 min as described previously (10Oksche A. Dehe M. Schülein R. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When required, cells were additionally treated for 3 h with bafilomycin A1 (1 μm, Merck Biosciences, Schwalbach, Germany) prior to fixation. Following permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS cells were incubated with a monoclonal c-Myc antibody (1:400) or with a monoclonal ERGIC-53 antibody (1:1,000), generously provided by Dr. H. P. Hauri (Basel, Switzerland), followed by an incubation with a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,200; BD Biosciences). LSM Analysis, LSM-FRET Imaging, and Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleach—Coverslips with HEK293 cells transiently expressing the different GFP fusion proteins were mounted in a temperable insert (Zeiss, Jena Germany) and analyzed with an LSM 510 META system using an Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 and PlanNeofluar 100×/1.3 objectives (all from Zeiss). GFP and YFP were investigated at λexc = 488 nm and λem >515 nm. The plasma membrane was visualized after addition of 20 μl of trypan blue (0.05% in PBS) at λexc = 543 nm and λem > 590 nm. The thickness of optical sections was between 0.3 and 0.6 μm. For quantitative analysis of antagonist-mediated cell surface expression, the plasma membrane identified in the trypan blue image was marked as region of interest (ROI) and subsequently transferred to the GFP image. In the GFP image a second ROI representing the cell interior was set, and the average fluorescence intensities in the plasma membrane and the cell interior were determined. For each single cell, the ratio of fluorescence in the plasma membrane and the cell interior was calculated. For FRET analyses, HEK293 cells grown on coverslips were transiently co-transfected with mV2R.CFP and mV2R.YFP. LSM-FRET imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching were performed as described in detail previously (11Gregan B. Jürgensen J. Papsdorf G. Furkert J. Schaefer M. Beyermann M.

Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). LSM-FRET imaging was performed with the LSM510 META and for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching we used an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100; Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 objective, a monochromator (Polychrome II; TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany) and a cooled CCD camera (Imago; TILL Photonics). For excitation a dual reflectivity dichroic mirror (<460 nm and 490–530 nm; Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT) and for emission band pass filters of 460–500 nm (CFP) or 535–580 nm (YFP) were used. Molecular Modeling of Antagonist-bound hV2R—The initial three-dimensional structure of the transmembrane helices of the hV2R was established on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of bovine rhodopsin (15Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The construction of the complete hV2R model has been described previously (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,16Krause G. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). The energetically preferred conformations for SR49059 and SR121463 were selected from searches of their conformational spaces by the random search module in the Sybyl 6.9 package (TRIPOS Inc., St. Louis, MO). The starting orientation for docking of the V1R-specific antagonist SR49059 to the hV2R model was comparable to the reported SR49059-bound V1AR model (17Tahtaoui C. Balestre M.N. Klotz P. Rognan D. Barberis C. Mouillac B. Hibert M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40010-40019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the case of SR121463, the initial orientation was derived after superposition of the common ring systems of SR121463 and SR49059. After minimization of the starting complex using the AMBER 5.0 force field (18Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Cladwell J.W. Chaetham III T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V.

University of California, San Francisco1998Google Scholar), molecular dynamics simulations were performed at 300 K for 500 ps, where only hydrogen bonds of the TM backbones maintaining the TM helices were restrained. Low energy conformations of the last 50 ps were compared. Investigated Wild-type and Mutant V2Rs and V2R·GFP Fusion Proteins—To clarify the mechanisms of antagonist-promoted restoration of cell surface expression, we investigated the predominantly ER-retained mV2R (9Oksche A. Leder G. Valet S. Platzer M. Hasse K. Geist S. Krause G. Rosenthal A. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 799-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, eight NDI-causing hV2R mutants (Fig. 1, gray boxes) (19Bichet D.G. Birnbaumer M. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Rosenthal W. Goodyer P. Nivet H. Benoit S. Giampietro P. Simonetti S. Fish A.

The mutants hW164R and hC319Y represent novel NDI-causing mutations. The mutant hW164R was identified in a patient with severe NDI, whereas patients with the mutant C319Y suffered from partial NDI, indicating that this mutant has retained residual activity. The in vitro mutant hD368K/S371X codes for a hV2R with an engineered dibasic ER-retrieval motif at the very C terminus of the hV2R. For all mutants with the exception of hD368K/S371X, plasmids were generated, which encode C-terminal GFP fusion proteins suitable for LSM of living cells and immunoblotting using GFP antibodies. In the case of the hD368K/S371X mutant, an N-terminally Myc epitope-tagged receptor was used (10Oksche A. Dehe M. Schülein R. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Retention of V2R Mutants in the ER—HEK293 cells transiently expressing the wild-type mV2R or different mutant hV2Rs show little or no [3H]AVP binding (Fig. 2A). For mV2R, hK100D and hF328A binding of [3H]AVP ranged between 8 and 16% of that for the wild-type hV2R. For all other mutants, including the hD368K/S371X mutant, [3H]AVP binding was less than 3% of that of the wild-type hV2R. LSM of transiently transfected HEK293 cells revealed that wild-type mV2R·GFP and mutant hV2R·GFPs were predominantly located within the ER (Fig. 2B). The staining patterns were indistinguishable from that of an ER-targeted cyan fluorescent protein derivative (ER·CFP). Membrane-permeable Receptor Antagonists Promote Cell Surface Delivery of the mV2R at a Post-translational Level— HEK293 cells transiently expressing the mV2R·GFP were treated with the non-peptide vasopressin V1 receptor (V1R)-antagonist SR49059 or the V2R-selective non-peptide antagonist SR121463B. Both antagonists (1 μm, 16 h) restored cell surface expression (Fig. 3A). In contrast, ETA and ETB receptor-selective non-peptide antagonists BQ123 and BQ788 (both 10 μm for 16 h) had no effect on the subcellular distribution of the mV2R (Fig. 3A, panels d and e). Co-transfection of the mV2R·GFP with dominant-negative K44A·dynamin did not increase the cell surface delivery of the mV2R·GFP, indicating that SR121463- and SR49059-promoted cell surface expression was not caused by an inhibition of internalization. The antagonist effects were preserved when cells were preincubated with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to the application of SR121463B (1 μm for 6 h; Fig. 3A, panel g). Similar results were obtained when cycloheximide was administered for 2 h prior to the addition of antagonists or when puromycin (20 μg/ml) was used instead of cycloheximide (data not shown). These results were further confirmed in [3H]AVP binding experiments. Since only SR49059, but not SR121463B can be removed from the mV2R and hV2R by washing (see “Experimental Procedures”), the experiments were performed with SR49059. Cells were treated for up to 6 h with buffer, SR49059, cycloheximide or the combination of SR49059 and cycloheximide. Membranes of cells treated with cycloheximide alone or left untreated did not differ in [3H]AVP binding, whereas membranes of cells treated with SR49059 or with cycloheximide and SR49059 revealed a 3-fold increase in [3H]AVP binding (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the ER-retained wild-type mV2R is not rapidly degraded, but remains in the ER for longer periods. Thus, the antagonists do not simply function by preventing degradation. Rather the antagonists promote the proper folding, e.g. increase conformational stability of the already synthesized mV2R retained in the ER. To test whether SR49059 also promotes cell surface delivery in cells that express the V2R endogenously, we studied primary cultured rat IMCD (13Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar). The V2Rs of rat and mouse are highly homologous and share the aspartate residue at position 100. Both receptors differ only by six amino acids (five in the extreme N terminus, one in the third intracellular loop). Treatment of rat IMCD cells with 1 μm SR49059 for 16 h increased specific [3H]AVP binding 2.5-fold (Fig. 3C), indicating that antagonists also promote cell surface expression of the endogenous rat V2R. SR121463B Promotes Maturation of the Wild-type mV2R·GFP—In immunoblots with membrane preparations of HEK293 cells transiently expressing hV2R·GFP, bands at 55 and 70–75 kDa were observed (Fig. 4). The broad band at 70–75 kDa corresponds to the mature, complex glycosylated hV2R·GFP, whereas the band at 55 kDa represents the immature, core-glycosylated hV2R·GFP (16Krause G. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Rutz C. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). Like the hV2R·GFP, the mV2R·GFP yields bands at 75 and 55 kDa, representing the mature and immature receptor, respectively (see Fig. 4). The complex glycosylated mV2R·GFP (75-kDa band) was less abundant than the corresponding one of the hV2R·GFP. Preincubation of cells with 1 μm SR121463B for 16 h prior to membrane preparation did not qualitatively change the hV2R·GFP and mV2R·GFP patterns; however, the intensity of the band representing the mature mV2R·GFP (75 kDa) was increased. These results were confirmed in cell surface biotinylation assays. HEK293 cells transiently expressing hV2R·GFP or mV2R·GFP were treated with 1 μm SR121463B or left untreated for 16 h, followed by an incubation with membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-biotin. Biotinylated proteins were isolated and analyzed in immunoblot experiments using a polyclonal GFP antibody. Both, the wild-type hV2R·GFP and the mV2R·GFP yielded a band at 75 kDa corresponding to the mature, complex glycosylated form. The intensity of the 75 kDa band was slightly enhanced following SR121463B treatment in the case of the hV2R·GFP. In the case of the mV2R; however, the antagonist treatment resulted in a strong increase in the intensity of the 75-kDa band (Fig. 4). The data demonstrate that SR121463B promotes both maturation and cell surface delivery of the wild-type mV2R. Quantitative LSM—In displacement binding analysis with [3H]AVP we found that the affinity of the mV2R for SR49059 was about 30-fold lower than for SR121463B (Ki values of the mV2R for SR49059 and SR121463B were 618 ± 317 nm and 17.2 ± 6.7 nm, respectively). In order to compare the potencies and time courses of both molecules to promote cell surface expression of the mV2R, we analyzed transiently transfected HEK293 cells for plasma membrane delivery of the mV2R·GFP in the presence of SR121463B or SR49059 (1 μm each). Every hour, images of GFP and trypan blue (which labels the plasma membrane) were taken. The intensity of GFP fluorescence from the cell interior and the plasma membrane were quantified, and the ratio was calculated. Both antagonists promoted cell surface delivery to an almost identical extent (6–7-fold), but revealed differences in their half-times (th) for maximal increase in cell surface delivery (th of SR121463- and SR49059-promoted cell surface delivery were 4.95 ± 0.11 h and 6.48 ± 0.14 h; Fig. 5A). In concentration response analyses we found that the half-maximal concentrations (EC50) required for SR121463B- and SR49059-promoted cell surface delivery of the mV2R were 22.6 ± 6.4 nm and 382 ± 73 nm, respectively. It is of note that the EC50 values were very similar to the Ki values of both antagonists. To validate the data from quantitative LSM, we also performed [3H]AVP binding experiments. Incubation of HEK293 cells transiently expressing the mV2R·GFP with SR49059 for up to 16 h resulted in a 10-fold increase in [3H]AVP binding sites (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the half-time for SR49059-mediated increase in [3H]AVP binding was about 9.5 h, which was significantly slower than that observed in quantitative LSM (compare with Fig. 5A). The reason for this difference is not known. One explanation could be that LSM does not allow us to distinguish between mV2R-containing vesicles in close proximit"
https://openalex.org/W1969675752,"The Pim-1 oncogene encodes a serine-threonine kinase that relays signals from cytokine receptors and contributes to the formation of lymphoid tumors when expressed at high levels. Here we show that the protein kinase Cdc25 C-associated kinase 1 (C-TAK1) is a binding partner and a substrate of Pim-1. A physical interaction of Pim-1 and C-TAK1 could be shown biochemically and in yeast two-hybrid assays. Immunofluorescence experiments suggested that Pim-1·C-TAK1 complexes are predominantly cytoplasmic. When transiently transfected, Pim-1 was also found in the nucleus and could recruit C-TAK1 to this compartment. Both Pim-1 and C-TAK1 underwent autophosphorylation, but only Pim-1 was able to phosphorylate C-TAK1 but not vice versa. Mass spectrometry analysis of C-TAK1 suggested that the sites of autophosphorylation and Pim-1-mediated phosphorylation are distinct and not overlapping. Phosphorylation by Pim-1 decreased C-TAK1 kinase activity significantly, in particular its ability to phosphorylate and inactivate Cdc25C, a protein that actively promotes cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase. Hence our findings directly suggest a novel role for Pim-1 as a positive regulator at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle.

The pim-1 gene encodes a 33-kDa cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase (1Padma R. Nagarajan L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2486-2489PubMed Google Scholar, 2Saris C.J. Domen J. Berns A.

The expression pattern of Pim-1 is widespread, and the protein is found in a series of tumors and tissues, but highest expression levels are found in cells of the hematopoietic and lymphoid system. Evidence that pim-1 is directly implicated in the tumorigenic process was provided by the analysis of Eμ pim-1 transgenic animals (6van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Krimpenfort P. Domen J. Saris C. Radaszkiewicz T. Berns A. Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Mice carrying a homozygous deletion of pim-1 generated by gene targeting show a very subtle phenotype (7Domen J. van der Lugt N.M. Laird P.W. Saris C.J. Berns A.

Experiments with interleukin-3-dependent cells suggest that Pim-1 is mediating gp130-mediated cell proliferation (12Shirogane T. Fukada T. Muller J.M. Shima D.T. Hibi M. Hirano T.

Therefore, Pim-1 is considered to be an effector of many cytokine signaling pathways, particularly of those that initiate signaling through STAT3 and STAT5 as for instance interleukin-2, -3, -6, and -7 and prolactin (12Shirogane T.

More recent data has implicated Pim-1 in the regulation of Socs-1, which is a negative regulator of the Jak/STAT pathway, and suggested that Pim-1 can also modulate cytokine signaling pathways in addition to its role as a direct effector kinase (20Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A putative substrate target sequence of Pim-1 has been identified by using a chemically synthesized peptide library (21Friedmann M. Nissen M.S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, since Pim-1 is able to phosphorylate itself but does not contain such a recognition sequence (22Palaty C.K. Clark-Lewis I. Leung D. Pelech S.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Palaty C.K. Kalmar G. Tai G. Oh S. Amankawa L. Affolter M. Aebersold R. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10514-10521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) it is very likely that other sites exist that can be phosphorylated by Pim-1. Efforts to shed more light on the function of Pim-1 have resulted in the identification of several interaction partners and substrates including p100, which is an activator of the c-Myb transcription factor (24Leverson J.D. Koskinen P.J. Orrico F.C. Rainio E.M. Jalkanen K.J. Dash A.B. Eisenman R.N. Ness S.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 417-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (25Rainio E.M. Sandholm J. Koskinen P.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) suggesting that Pim-1 can affect the regulation of transcription in the nucleus. Furthermore the G1-specific phosphatase Cdc25A was found to be a substrate of Pim-1, and it has been demonstrated that it can be activated through phosphorylation by Pim-1 (26Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Muramatsu T. Asai A. Kuchino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18659-18666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cdc25A activates the kinase activity of G1-specific cyclin·cyclin-dependent kinase complexes by removing inhibitory phosphate groups and is a positive regulator of cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. The identification of Cdc25A as a Pim-1 substrate was therefore the first direct proof that Pim-1 activity is linked to cell cycle progression. Other experiments have indicated that the cyclin kinase inhibitor p21Waf is inactivated through Pim-1 phosphorylation (27Wang Z. Bhattacharya N. Mixter P.F. Wei W. Sedivy J. Magnuson N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1593: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) or have suggested a synergistic role for Pim-1 and Myc in cell cycle progression dependent of STAT3 (12Shirogane T. Fukada T. Muller J.M. Shima D.T. Hibi M. Hirano T. Immunity. 1999; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In addition to a role in promoting cell cycle progression, Pim-1 also has been linked to the regulation of programmed cell death, and an antiapoptotic effect of Pim-1 has been demonstrated in several independent experimental systems (12Shirogane T.

Biophys. 2001; 390: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A direct effect of Pim-1 on particular constituents of the known apoptotic signaling pathways, however, could not be shown, and the question how Pim-1 regulates apoptosis remains open. A number of other substrates of Pim-1 have been found; among them are HP-1, a heterochromatin-binding protein with a role in gene silencing (34Koike N. Maita H. Taira T. Ariga H. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and PAP1, a novel protein with a putative function in transcription repression and the regulation of mRNA splicing (35Maita H. Harada Y. Nagakubo D. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Takahashi K. Ariga H. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5168-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Other Pim-1-interacting proteins such as tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4-associated factor 2/sorting nexin 6 or Socs-1 belong to the group of adapter proteins and are involved in STAT or tumor necrosis factor receptor signal transduction pathways (20Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We wished to further elucidate how the Pim-1 kinase connects signal transduction pathways initiated by cytokines and the Jak/STAT pathway to the cell cycle machinery and to describe how Pim-1 translates this signal into a proliferative response. To this end, we aimed to find so far unknown substrates of Pim-1 that have a direct role in the regulation of cell cycle progression. Using a novel yeast interaction cloning system we identified the kinase Cdc twenty-five C-associated kinase 1 (C-TAK1) as a Pim-1 interaction partner and substrate and also demonstrated that phosphorylation by Pim-1 significantly decreases C-TAK1 activity suggesting that Pim-1 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression at the G2/M transition by affecting the activity of Cdc25C through C-TAK1 in vitro and in vivo (37Peng C.Y.

Ras Recruitment Screening (RRS) and Mutational Analysis in Yeast—All yeast plasmids used in this study were derived from the galactose-inducible Yes2 (Invitrogen) and the constitutive ADNS vector. DNA fragments for Pim-1-K67M and c-Jun fused in-frame to a Ha-Ras sequence (constitutively active form) were generated by PCR. For Yes2-derived plasmids, human c-Fos was fused to Src myristoylation signals (M-Fos). For ADNS-derived plasmids, human Pim-1-K67M (amino acids 1–313, ADNS-Pim-1-K67M-5′Ras) and human c-Jun leucine zipper (amino acids 249–331, Jun-Z-Ras) were fused with Ha-Ras sequences. The cDNA library used in this study has been described before (38Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 39Hennemann H. Vassen L. Geisen G. Eilers M. Möröy T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28799-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RRS library screening with Pim-1-K67M bait was performed essentially as described previously (38Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 40Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the β-galactosidase assay the Pim-1-K67M cDNA was subcloned into a BamHI/EcoRI-cut pLexA vector in-frame with the LexA binding domain (41Rödel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bachmann M. Schaper F. Heinrich P. Shuai K. Elsasser H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The sequence encoding the C-TAK1-Y6131 fragment was amplified by PCR and inserted in frame with the VP16 transactivation domain into pVP16 (42Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The VP16-Gfi-VII plasmid was used as a negative control (41Rödel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bachmann M. Schaper F. Heinrich P. Shuai K. Elsasser H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The LexA-Pim-1-K67M and either the VP16-C-TAK1-Y6131 or VP16-Gfi-VII plasmids were introduced into the yeast strain L40 (42Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The assay was performed as described previously (41Rödel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bachmann M. Schaper F. Heinrich P. Shuai K. Elsasser H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Expression of proteins was tested by Western blotting using either anti-VP16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1–21) or anti-LexA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 2–12) antibodies. Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used for Western blotting: anti-Cdc25C (Biodiagnostics (BM-025C-100A) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-20, H6)), anti-C-TAK1, anti-Pim-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 19F7), and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). As secondary antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Dianova) were used. For immunoprecipitations anti-LexA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 2–12) and anti Pim-1 monoclonal antibody P9 2P. X. Xing, unpublished data. were used. Anti-C-TAK1 antibody was produced by immunization of a rabbit using C-TAK1-(1–165), which was purified on a GST-C-TAK1-(1–165) affinity column after expression in bacteria and removed from glutathione S-transferase (GST) by thrombin digestion. Kinase Assay—To assay Pim-1 and C-TAK1 kinase activities, the respective GST proteins were purified, mixed (40 μl of bead slurry), and resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (Pim-1: 20 mm PIPES, pH = 7.0, 5 mm MnCl2, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol; C-TAK1: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2; both: 10 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). FLAG-tagged Pim-1 or C-TAK1 proteins immunoprecipitated from transfected COS7 cells also served as kinases. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min (Pim-1) or at 20 °C for 30 min (C-TAK1), boiled in SDS-sample buffer, resolved on an SDS gel, and subsequently analyzed by x-ray film exposure. Mass Spectrometry—GST-C-TAK1-wt, C-TAK1-N183A, and Pim-1-wt proteins were purified. Kinase assays were performed as described above but were done with non-radioactively labeled ATP. Phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated proteins were cut out of the gel and digested with the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, or Glu-C. To detect phosphorylation, fragments were analyzed by a mass spectrometer. C-TAK1 Inactivation Assay—Two consecutive kinase assays were performed. In the first kinase assay, purified GST-Pim-1-wt or GST-Pim-1-K67M proteins were eluted from the GSH-agarose beads and used as kinases. The purified substrate (C-TAK1) remained coupled to the GSH-agarose beads. After the first kinase assay C-TAK1-GSH-agarose beads were precipitated, washed once with C-TAK1 kinase buffer to eliminate soluble Pim-1 protein, and used in the second kinase assay this time as a kinase. Purified GST-Cdc25C protein served as a substrate in the second kinase assay. The samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved on an SDS gel, and subsequently analyzed by x-ray film exposure. Cell Cycle Analysis—The cell cycle phase distribution of 293 cells was examined by flow cytometry using FACScan and Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). 1 × 106 cells were transfected with pBB14 (green fluorescent protein (GFP); Refs. 43Brideau A.D. Banfield B.W. Enquist L.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 44Kalejta R.F. Brideau A.D. Banfield B.W. Beavis A.J. J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Pim-1 or C-TAK1 constructs. 24 h after transfection 293 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml bleomycin for 24 h and harvested. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline/ethanol for 1 h. After centrifugation cells were stained with propidium iodide (20 μg/ml) for 30 min and analyzed. Pim-1 Interacts with C-TAK1 in Yeast—To identify proteins that interact with the Pim-1 kinase, we used a yeast interaction cloning strategy based on the RRS (40Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed a “bait” plasmid able to express the kinase-inactive 33-kDa form of Pim-1 (Pim-1-K67M) in fusion with Ha-Ras in the vector pADNS-Ras(mut) (40Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and introduced this along with an mammalian GTPase activating protein expression plasmid (45Aronheim A.

This GTPase exchange factor activates the endogenous yeast Ras pathway under permissive conditions (25 °C) but is inactivated by a shift to the restrictive temperature of 36 °C. After introduction of DNA from the GC library (38Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) 417 initial clones were obtained, 13 of which showed library plasmid dependence on galactose/glucose medium. Four of 11 clones that passed a bait specificity test (Fig. 1a) contained DNA sequences coding for C-TAK1 (37Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Ogg S. Thoma R.S. Byrnes III, M.J. Wu Z. Stephenson M.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 197-208PubMed Google Scholar). One of the clones (Y6131, see Fig. 1), which contained the longest C-TAK1 sequence covering amino acid positions 1–263, was used in the subsequent experiments. To verify a potential interaction between Pim-1 and C-TAK1, we fused the obtained C-TAK1 sequence to sequences encoding the herpes simplex virus VP16 transactivation domain in a galactose-inducible vector. This construct was cotransfected with plasmids encoding fusion proteins between the DNA binding domain of LexA and the kinase-inactive mutant of Pim-1. As a control, we used a construct encoding a fusion protein between LexA and a stretch of the zinc finger transcription factor Gfi1 (Fig. 1b and Ref. 41Rödel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bachmann M. Schaper F. Heinrich P. Shuai K. Elsasser H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of extracts from transformed yeast cells demonstrated that the expression constructs were functional (Fig. 1b). In the presence of galactose, a high β-galactosidase activity was obtained only with the constructs expressing LexA-Pim-1 and C-TAK1-VP16 fusion proteins (Fig. 1b) supporting an interaction between Pim-1 and C-TAK1. To obtain the human full-length C-TAK1 clone, we screened a human spleen cDNA library by PCR and isolated, in addition to the wt C-TAK1 cDNA, two novel variants of C-TAK1 with additional coding sequences that were termed C-TAK1-α (two additional coding regions: X, 9 amino acids (aa); Y, 15 aa) and C-TAK1-β (one additional coding region: Y, 15 aa; Fig. 1c). Pim-1 Binds C-TAK1 in Vitro and in Vivo—To test whether Pim-1 and C-TAK1 can form complexes in vitro, we generated fusion proteins between GST and the C-TAK1 fragment initially isolated during the RRS screen (C-TAK1-Y6131), the full-length C-TAK1-wt, the variant C-TAK1-α and -β forms, and different mutants of C-TAK1. Radioactively labeled Pim-1 and C-TAK1-wt proteins produced in an in vitro transcriptiontranslation system were retained by GST-C-TAK1-wt, the amino-terminal C-TAK1 fragments spanning aa 1–263 (Y6131) and aa 1–165, and the C-TAK1 variants α and β (Fig. 2a) indicating that the amino-terminal part of C-TAK1 is sufficient to bind Pim-1 and that C-TAK1 can interact with itself (Fig. 2a). Next radiolabeled C-TAK1-wt protein was mixed with extracts from cells transfected with expression constructs for the FLAG-tagged C-TAK1 fragment Y6131, Pim-1-wt, the kinase-inactive Pim-1 mutant (K67M), or the irrelevant proteins Evi5 or PIAS3. Complexes were precipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and auto radiography. Clearly radioactively labeled C-TAK1 protein was precipitated only from lysates containing C-TAK1 itself or the Pim-1 proteins, but a precipitation from lysates containing Evi5 or PIAS3 was not readily detected confirming the specificity of the C-TAK1/Pim-1 interaction (Fig. 2b). Similar results were obtained when C-TAK1 splice variants were used (data not shown). Using the RRS and the original yeast clone with the prey plasmid Y6131 that encodes the C-TAK1 fragment spanning aa 1–263, we selected a C-TAK1 point mutant by error-prone PCR that was unable to interact with Pim-1. The selected mutants carried a proline residue instead of a leucine at position 128 (C-TAK-Y6131-L128P). The wt C-TAK1-Y6131 and the mutant C-TAK1-Y6131-L128P fragments were transiently expressed as FLAG-tagged versions along with Pim-1-wt or Pim-1-K67M in COS7 cells (Fig. 2c). Immunoprecipitations with anti-FLAG antibodies from these cells revealed that only C-TAK1-Y6131 but not the mutant containing the L128P “loss of interaction” substitution formed complexes with Pim-1-wt or Pim-1-K67M (Fig. 2c) indicating that aa 128 in C-TAK1 is critical for Pim-1 binding. A GST pull-down experiment with lysates from cells transfected with a Pim-1 expression construct confirmed that a bona fide loss of interaction mutant had been created (Fig. 2d). The previously described kinase-inactive C-TAK1 mutants (37Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Ogg S. Thoma R.S. Byrnes III, M.J. Wu Z. Stephenson M.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 197-208PubMed Google Scholar), the two novel splice variants of C-TAK1, and the aminoterminal deletion mutant C-TAK1-(81–729) were still able to bind Pim-1 (Fig. 2d) suggesting that the domain in the C-TAK1 protein that is responsible for Pim-1 binding is localized in an amino-terminal region spanning aa 81–165. Pim-1 Co-localizes with C-TAK1 in Myeloid and Epithelial Cells—The C-TAK1-wt protein but also the C-TAK1-N183A mutant and the mutant that lacks interaction with Pim-1 were localized exclusively in the cytoplasm when expressed transiently in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3a) regardless whether nontagged or FLAG-tagged versions or fusions between C-TAK1-wt or both splice variants and the GFP were expressed (Fig. 3a and data not shown). In contrast, Pim-1-wt and the kinase-inactive mutant K67M both resided in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm of NIH 3T3 cells upon transient transfection of the respective expression constructs regardless whether anti-Pim-1 or anti-FLAG antibodies were used (Fig. 3a and data not shown). When co-expressed in fibroblasts, both the wt C-TAK1 and the C-TAK1-N183A mutant co-localized in the nucleus with Pim-1 (Fig. 3b, upper and lower panels) or with Pim-1-K67M (not shown) in all transfected cells, whereas the loss of interaction mutant C-TAK1-L128P and Pim-1 did not show such a nuclear interaction (Fig. 3b, middle panel). Next we stained HeLa cells with antibodies against Pim-1 or C-TAK1 and found a predominantly cytoplasmic and to a minor degree nuclear localization of the endogenous proteins (Fig. 4a). Here the staining for both endogenous C-TAK1 and Pim-1 appeared to overlap suggesting co-localization of both proteins (Fig. 4b, upper panels). As expected a co-localization and complete overlap of C-TAK1 and Cdc25C was observed and served as a positive control (Fig. 4b, lower panels). To verify that Pim-1 forms complexes with C-TAK1 at the endogenous expression level, we chose HeLa cells, U 937 promyelocytes stimulated with phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), and cells from the myeloid tumor line K 562 that all express endogenous Pim-1 and C-TAK1 (Fig. 4c). We were able to precipitate endogenous Pim-1 from U 937 and K 562 lysates with GST-C-TAK1 fusion protein coupled to agarose beads but not with the irrelevant Evi5-GST fusion protein or GST alone (Fig. 4d). In addition, C-TAK1 could be immunoprecipitated with anti-Pim-1 antibodies but not with irrelevant LexA antibodies from all three cell lines (Fig. 4e and data not shown). Pim-1 Phosphorylates C-TAK1—Whereas both GST-C-TAK1 and GST-Pim-1 fusion proteins showed autophosphorylation, the inactive GST-Pim-1-K67M mutant was unable to phosphorylate itself as expected (Fig. 5a). Neither Pim-1 nor C-TAK1 phosphorylated purified GST protein indicating the specificity of the assay (Fig. 5a). The GST-C-TAK1 but also the GST-Cdc25C fusion proteins were each detected as two signals in gels: as a slower migrating form representing the full-length fusion protein and as a faster migrating form representing a specific degradation product that still contains part of the C-TAK1 or Cdc25C proteins and the GST portion (see Fig. 5, a and b, and data not shown). C-TAK1-wt and the two new splice variants C-TAK1-α and -β could autophosphorylate themselves and phosphorylated Cdc25C either as a GST fusion protein or as a recombinant purified protein as expected (Fig. 5b). When GST-C-TAK1 fusion proteins were mixed with GST-Pim-1-wt, both autophosphorylated proteins were detected; when GST-C-TAK1 fusion proteins and the inactive Pim-1 kinase mutant K67M were mixed only the autophosphorylated GST-C-TAK1 proteins were detected suggesting that C-TAK1 does not phosphorylate Pim-1 (Fig. 5c). The kinase-inactive C-TAK1 mutants N183A and D196N did not show autophosphorylation and remained unphosphorylated in the presence of the inactive Pim-1-K67M mutant (Fig. 5d). However, when GST-Pim-1-wt was added, both C-TAK1 mutants were phosphorylated (Fig. 5d). In addition, the phosphorylation of C-TAK1-wt was significantly stronger in the presence of GST-Pim-1-wt than in the presence of the inactive Pim-1-K67M mutant (Fig. 5d) suggesting that Pim-1 phosphorylates C-TAK1. A similar result was obtained when a FLAG-tagged Pim-1 or a FLAG-tagged kinase-inactive Pim-1-K67M mutant was expressed in COS7 cells, immunoprecipitated, and used as a kinase to phosphorylate C-TAK1 (data not shown). As an additional control the loss of interaction mutant C-TAK1-L128P was used in this assay and was not phosphorylated by Pim-1-wt as expected (Fig. 5d). Furthermore Pim-1 was able to phosphorylate a C-TAK1 mutant"

Infection causes severe neurological disease and fatalities in both human and animal hosts. The West Nile viral protease (NS2B-NS3) is essential for post-translational processing in host-infected cells of a viral polypeptide precursor into structural and functional viral proteins, and its inhibition could represent a potential treatment for viral infections. This article describes the design, expression, and enzymatic characterization of a catalytically active recombinant WNV protease, consisting of a 40-residue component of cofactor NS2B tethered via a noncleavable nonapeptide (G4SG4) to the N-terminal 184 residues of NS3. A chromogenic assay using synthetic para-nitroanilide (pNA) hexapeptide substrates was used to identify optimal enzyme-processing conditions (pH 9.5, I < 0.1 m, 30% glycerol, 1 mm CHAPS), preferred substrate cleavage sites, and the first competitive inhibitor (Ac-FASGKR-H, IC50 ∼1 μm). A putative three-dimensional structure of WNV protease, created through homology modeling based on the crystal structures of Dengue-2 and Hepatitis C NS3 viral proteases, provides some valuable insights for structure-based design of potent and selective inhibitors of WNV protease.

Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 371-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). WNV is a member of the Flaviviridae family that also includes hepatitis C, Kunjin, yellow fever, Dengue, St. Louis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses (1Brinton M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 371-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). WNV is transmitted via mosquitoes from avian reservoir hosts to vertebrate dead-end hosts that include humans and horses. Endemic in humans in parts of Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, previous viral outbreaks were mostly detected as asymptomatic infections or mild febrile disease states (2Hayes C.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 951: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, recent outbreaks in Israel (1998), Romania (1996), and the United States (1999) (3Lanciotti R.S. Roehrig J.T. Deubel V. Smith J. Parker M. Steele K. Crise B. Volpe K.E. Crabtree M.B. Scherret J.H. Hall R.A. MacKenzie J.S. Cropp C.B. Panigrahy B. Ostlund E. Schmitt B. Malkinson M. Banet C. Weissman J.

Science. 1999; 286: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar) have been associated with more serious neurological pathology and fatal infections. During the last 5 years, WNV has spread rapidly throughout the United States (4,156 infections and 284 deaths in 44 states in 2002, 9862 infections and 264 deaths in 2003), 2CDC (2000) Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Disease: West Nile Virus; Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm. Canada, and Mexico, as well as appearing recently in the United Kingdom (5Buckley A. Dawson A. Moss S.R. Hinsley S.A. Bellamy P.E. Gould E.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2807-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This rapid global spread, even through developed countries, has prompted widespread implementation of prevention strategies. No vaccines or therapeutic treatments for WNV infections are yet available. Like other members of the Flaviviridae family, WNV contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which encodes three structural proteins (capsid (C), membrane (M), envelope (E)), and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) (1Brinton M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 371-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 3Lanciotti R.S. Roehrig J.T. Deubel V. Smith J. Parker M. Steele K. Crise B. Volpe K.E. Crabtree M.B. Scherret J.H.

Science. 1999; 286: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). The genome is initially translated as a single, large polyprotein precursor. Post-translational cleavages of the viral polyprotein precursor in the cytoplasm of host-infected cells are necessary to produce the separate structural and functional viral proteins that are essential for assembly of new viral progeny. These cleavages are performed by both host enzymes (including signalases and furin) and by a viral protease encoded by the N-terminal-third of NS3 (Fig. 1). This NS3 viral protease, which is a trypsin-like serine protease with a functional catalytic triad (His51, Asp75, Ser135), is absolutely essential (along with viral-encoded cofactor NS2B) for viral replication and is itself autocatalytically cleaved from the polypeptide precursor. By analogy with the homologous Dengue virus NS3 protease, for which our truncation studies had previously shown that a 40-residue hydrophilic domain of NS2B is necessary for catalytic activity of the NS3 protease, (6Leung D. Schroder K. White H. Fang N.X. Stoermer M.J. Abbenante G. Martin J.L. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45762-45771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) we infer below that a similar sequence within the WNV NS2B is likely necessary for catalytic activity of the WNV NS3 protease. The remainder of NS2B encodes 3 hydrophobic domains, believed to be involved in membrane association and localization of the enzyme to convoluted membrane regions on the endoplasmic reticulum (7Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The structure of WNV NS3 protease is unknown, but there are reported crystal structures for related NS3 proteases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (8Love R.A. Parge H.E. Wickersham J.A. Hostomsky Z.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5573-5580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The structure of the latter protease was however determined in the absence of the NS2B cofactor and was thus an inactive enzyme. By virtue of its essential function in post-translational processing of the viral polypeptide, WNV NS3 protease is implicated as a potential target for development of therapeutics that prevent viral replication. Precedents for inhibitors of viral proteases being potential antiviral drugs lie in the success of inhibitors of proteases of the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), currently the most effective treatments for humans with HIV/AIDS (10Gulick R.M.

This article describes the design and construction of a catalytically active recombinant WNV NS2B-NS3 protease enzyme construct, the characterization of factors that influence enzymatic processing of short synthetic chromogenic substrates containing para-nitroanilide (pNA), the first reported inhibitor of WNV protease, and the development of a three-dimensional homology-modeled structure of the WNV NS3 protease based on the known crystal structures of Dengue NS3 protease and HCV NS3 protease complexed with cofactor NS4A. It is expected that the recombinant protease cofactor construct, chromogenic assay, and homology structure might be useful for future structure-based design of even more potent and selective inhibitors of the WNV NS3 protease. Such inhibitors might form the basis for developing an antiviral therapy for the treatment of WNV infections. General Methods—Protected amino acids and resins were obtained from Auspep, Novabiochem and PepChem. Trifluoroacetic acid, piperidine, DIPEA, DCM, and DMF (peptide synthesis grade) were purchased from Auspep. All other materials were reagent grade unless otherwise stated. Crude peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18, 10–15 μm, 300 Å, 50 × 250 mm) column, using a gradient mixture of solvent (A) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water and (B) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/10% water/90% acetonitrile. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Waters system equipped with a 717 plus autosampler, 660 controller and a 996 photodiode array detector, using a reverse-phase Phenomenex Luna C18, 5 μm, 100 Å, 250 × 4.6-mm column. Purified peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC (linear gradient 0–100% B over 30 min), mass spectrometry, and NMR. The molecular weight of the peptides (1 mg/ml) was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Micromass LCT mass spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on samples containing 4 mm peptide in Me2SO-d6 (550 μl) on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer at 298 K. Proton assignments were determined by TOCSY (80 ms mixing time), DQF-COSY, ECOSY, and NOESY (350 ms mixing time) spectra using the sequential assignment method (13Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley-Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). All spectra were processed on Silicon Graphics R10000 or R12000 workstations using XWINNMR 2.6 (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Federal Republic of Germany). Plasmid Construction—WNV (strain NY99–4132)-infected Vero cell RNA was generously provided by R. A. Hall and D. J. Nisbet (University of Queensland, Australia). cDNA was generated using the WNV NS3pro.RHindIII reverse primer (5′-GCCCCCAAGCTTACAGCATCTCAGGTTCGAAT-3′; restriction sites are underlined), which was then used as template in the generation of the WNV NS3pro and the WNV CF40.Gly.NS3pro constructs. WNV NS3pro was generated by a PCR reaction using the primers WNV NS3pro.FBamH1 5′-GCCCCTGGATCCGGTGGCGTATTGTGGGATACT-3′ and WNV NS3pro.RHindIII 5′-GCCCCCAAGCTTACAGCATCTCAGGTTCGAAT-3′. WNV CF40.GLY. NS3PRO was generated in two separate PCR reactions employing the primer pairs WNV CF40.FBamH1 5′-CGATGAC GGCGGATCCACAGATATGTGGATTGAGAGAACG-3′/WNV CF40.Gly.R 5′-CCCGCCTCCACCACTACCTCCCCCGCCCTTCCAAGGAGCACCTGGATC-3′ and WNV NS3proGly.F 5′-GGCGGGGGAGGTAGTGGTGGAGGCGGGGGAGGCGTATTGTGGGA TACT-3′/WNV NS3pro.RHindIII 5′-GCCCCCAAGCTTACAGCATCTCAGGTTCGAAT-3′ to generate PCR products encoding the essential 40 residue cofactor domain of NS2B and the 184 residue NS3pro genes, flanked with partial glycine linker sequences. These PCR products were then joined by overlapping PCR using the outer primers WNV CF40.FBamHI and WNV NS3pro.RHindIII. The resulting PCR products, designated WNV NS3pro and CF40.Gly.NS3pro, comprised the 184 residue NS3 protease domain alone and the 40 residue essential cofactor domain of NS2B linked to the 184 residue NS3 protease via a flexible nonapeptide glycine linker (Gly4SerGly4), respectively. These were then digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pQE9. The identity of these constructs, designated pQE9 WNV NS3pro and pQE9 WNV CF40.Gly.NS3pro was confirmed by automated sequence analysis. Enzyme Expression and Purification—The pQE9 WNV CF40.-Gly.NS3pro vector was used to allow high level, inducible expression of N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged recombinant proteins. Cultures of Escherichia coli strain SG13009 transformed with the expression plasmids were grown in 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until OD600 reached 0.5. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.3 mm and incubated for an additional 3 h at 22 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C. For protein purification, the cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl,10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol) per 1 g of wet pellet. To prevent proteolytic cleavage of protein during cell lysis and purification the following protease inhibitors were added to give the final concentration of 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml benzamide, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml TLCK. The resuspended cells were lysed by three passes through a French Press at a pressure of 1000 Pascals and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The recombinant proteases, tagged at the N terminus by a hexahistidine sequence, were purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). A 1-cm column was pre-equilibrated with 30 ml of column buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol), and then the resin was removed and mixed with the supernatant of the cell lysates. These mixtures were then incubated at 4 °C on a shaker for 30 min to allow the His-tagged protein to bind to the Ni2+ resin. The columns were re-packed and washed with 30 ml of column buffer containing 20 mm imidazole before eluting the protein into 6 × 1 ml fractions with column buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The pre- and post-IPTG induction samples, soluble and insoluble fractions, and the elution fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE.

Enzymatic Characterization—The recombinant WNV protease (WNV CF40.Gly.NS3pro) was assayed against four hexapeptide substrates corresponding to P6-P1 of known endogenous cleavage sites NS2A-NS2B (Ac-DPNRKR-pNA), NS2B-NS3 (Ac-LQYTKR-pNA), NS3-NS4A (Ac-FASGKR-pNA), NS4B-NS5 (Ac-KPGLKR-pNA) with a chromogenic pNA group in the P1′ position. Cleavage of the pNA chromophore from the peptide substrates by the WNV protease produced a detectable color change at 405 nm, allowing protease activity to be measured. The assay was conducted on a 96-well plate with a final reaction volume of 200 μl containing buffer (plus glycerol and CHAPS detergent for optimal processing), 0.5 μm recombinant protease, and 500 μm substrate at 37 °C. After preincubation in separate wells (10 min, 37 °C), catalysis was initiated by mixing substrate with the enzyme buffer solution by automatic shaking. The optical density was measured at 405 nm every 30 s for 10 min in a SpectraMax 250 reader, and the average change in mOD/min was calculated. pH dependence was determined over the range 5.5–12.0 using 0.5 μm enzyme, 500 μm substrate (Ac-FASGKR-pNA), incubation temperature 37 °C, constant ionic strength (I = 5mm), final volume 200 μl, for 50 mm buffer (MES (pH 5.5–7.0), MOPS (pH 6.5–8.0), Tris (pH 7.5–9.5), CAPS (pH 10.0–11.0)) containing NaCl, glycerol, CHAPS detergent. Glycerol dependence was determined by assaying environments of increasing glycerol content, from 0 to 50% glycerol (5% increments) in the final volume of 200 μl. Glycerol dependence assays contained buffer with NaCl, glycerol, CHAPS detergent, 0.5 μm enzyme, 500 μm substrate (Ac-FASGKR-pNA), constant ionic strength (I = 5 mm, NaCl), at 37 °C in a final volume 200 μl. Ionic strength dependence was determined for 0–200 mm NaCl in buffer (with glycerol, CHAPS), 0.5 μm enzyme, 500 μm substrate (Ac-FASGKR-pNA), 37 °C in the final volume of 200 μl. Initial reaction velocities were monitored continuously at 405 nm on a SpectraMax® 250 spectrophotometer, and then interpreted using the accompanying SoftMax™ Pro software, both from Molecular Devices Corporation. Subsequent assays for Km determination were performed under optimal pH, glycerol and ionic strength conditions as determined by interpretation of the previous pH, glycerol, and ionic strength assays via SoftMax™ Pro and GraphPad Prism® software. Optimal assaying conditions, found to be 30% glycerol, pH 9.5, no added NaCl, were used to determine Km and kcat values measured for the four pNA-peptide substrates at concentrations ranging from 100 to 3000 μm. Results were graphed using GraphPad Prism® version 4.0a for Macintosh, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA (www.graphpad.com), and kinetic parameters calculated from weighted nonlinear regression assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics (v = Vmax[S]/[S]+Km), kcat values calculated from kcat = Vmax/[E].

Design of a Catalytically Active WNV Protease—The single serine protease within the flaviviral WNV RNA genome provides an ideal starting point and therapeutic target for research into the design and development of a WNV serine protease inhibitor. The first step in designing a catalytically active WNV protease was based on our previous work on the Dengue-2 viral protease, for which we identified a minimum sequence of 184 residues from the NS3 protease (NS3pro) and 40 residues from the NS2B cofactor (CF40) that are necessary for catalytic processing of substrates (6Leung D. Schroder K. White H. Fang N.X. Stoermer M.J. Abbenante G. Martin J.L. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol.

Virol. 1999; 80: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In that work we created a catalytically active protease construct by fusing CF40 to NS3pro separated by various linkers, the most active construct involving a nonapeptide linker (GGGGSGGGG) as a replacement for the normal NS2B-NS3A cleavage sequence. Alignment of the WNV and Dengue virus NS2B-NS3 sequences (Fig. 2) indicated 53% sequence identity (exact amino acid match) and 79% sequence similarity (hydrophilicity/phobicity) within the 184 residues of NS3pro. This homology, including conserved catalytic residues His51 (H), Asp75 (D), and Ser135 (S), and oxyanion residue Gly133 (G), gave us confidence in our alignment. Residue Gly178 in WNV NS3 was not present in Dengue-2 virus NS3. Alignment of the NS2B cofactor domains displayed 33% sequence identity (exact amino acid match) and 75% sequence similarity (high and low chemical similarity). These sequence comparisons suggested that, by analogy with the Dengure-2 NS2B-NS3 protease, a catalytically active sequence for WNV NS2B-NS3 protease might similarly constitute 40 residues from the NS2B cofactor and 184 residues from NS3, connected via a nonapeptide linker G4SG4 (abbreviated as Gly) in place of the normal NS2B-NS3 cleavage site sequence. We designated the putative catalytic protease construct as WNV CF40.Gly.NS3pro. A recombinant construct was also generated consisting of the 184 residue NS3 protease domain in the absence of the NS2B cofactor domain to confirm that activity was dependent on the correct association of the cofactor, as was previously shown for the Dengue virus equivalent construct (6Leung D. Schroder K. White H. Fang N.X. Stoermer M.J. Abbenante G. Martin J.L. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol.

To determine whether GT recognizes folding intermediates or irreparably misfolded species with nearly native structures, we generated and tested as GT substrates neoglycoprotein fragments derived from chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (GCI2) bearing from 53 to 64 (full-length) amino acids. Fragment conformations mimicked the last stage-folding structures adopted by a glycoprotein entering the ER lumen. GT catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) remained constant from GCI2-(1–53) to GCI2-(1–58) and then steadily declined to reach a minimal value with GCI2-(1–64). The same parameter showed a direct hyperbolic relationship with solvent accessibility of the single Trp residue but only in fragments exposing hydrophobic amino acid patches. Mutations introduced (GCI2-(1–63)V63S and GCI2-(1–64)V63S) produced slight structural destabilizations but increased GT catalytic efficiency. This parameter presented an inverse exponential relationship with the free energy of unfolding of canonical and mutant fragments. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency showed a linear relationship with the fraction of unfolded species in water. It was concluded that the GT-derived quality control may be operative with nearly native conformers and that no alternative ER-retaining mechanisms are required when glycoproteins approach their proper folding.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Proteins incorrectly folded are initially retained in the ER and eventually degraded by the proteasome, a process known as ER-associated degradation (2Fewell S.W. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Brodsky J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 149-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 3Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Recent findings on glycoprotein processing in the ER showed that sugar moieties could be exploited to encode information on glycoprotein folding status. About 65% of Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus sequences in proteins entering the ER lumen are N-glycosylated (4Petrescu A.J. Milac A.L. Petrescu S.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 glycan transferred is deglucosylated immediately by the sequential action of glucosidases I and II. At this stage the proteins that are not correctly folded are reglucosylated by UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT), generating Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. This enzyme has a unique property as it glucosylates glycoproteins displaying native-close, molten globule-like but not random coil or compact-native conformations. Monoglucosylated glycans are specifically recognized by two ER resident lectins, calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT), in charge of retaining folding intermediates and irreparably misfolded glycoproteins in the ER. In addition, lectin binding facilitates conformational maturation of glycoproteins by preventing aggregation and allowing the labor of lectin-associated proteins such as ERp57 (endoplasmic reticulum protein 57), a protein of the protein disulfide isomerase family (5Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The single glucose added by GT is removed in vivo by glucosidases I and II, whose activity is independent of the folding status of glycoproteins, causing the release of the latter from the lectin anchors. The ensuing shuttle between Glc-containing, lectin-bound, and Glc- and lectin-free species, catalyzed by the opposing activities of GT and glucosidases I and II ends on acquisition of native compact conformations. The selectivity of this cycle for misfolded proteins resides in GT, since it is the only element of the mechanism that senses glycoprotein conformational states. This quality control mechanism is not the only one operating in the ER as there are alternative mechanisms for retaining proteins not displaying their fully folded structures, as those involving other conventional chaperones, such as BiP/Grp78 or reversible disulfide bonding with ER resident proteins (1Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Because GT reglucosylates a myriad of misfolded glycoproteins, the molecular determinants for glycoprotein recognition should be, in principle, independent of the primary structure and should rest upon elements common to irreparably misfolded or partially folded structures. Current evidence points to exposure of hydrophobic residues as the common determinant (6Taylor S.C. Thibault P. Tessier D.C. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Taylor S.C. Ferguson A.D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In a recent work we presented evidence showing that GT recognized local stretches of hydrophobic residues in small disordered fragments rather poorly but actively glucosylated glycoproteins showing long range interactions in molten globule-like conformations, thus, exposing anilinonaphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) binding hydrophobic patches (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It remained to be established, however, if the enzyme is sensitive enough to glucosylate glycoproteins with minimal structural differences with respect to native conformations. Inability to glucosylate nearly native conformations would mean that alternative retaining systems must replace CNX and CRT at the end of the folding process or in irreparably misfolded species, showing conformations slightly differing from native ones. To address this issue we have now correlated GT catalytic efficiency with structures of neoglycoproteins of increasing sizes approaching that of the full-length species, thus mimicking the last folding conformations adopted by a glycoprotein entering the ER lumen. We, thus, found that GT is an exquisite sensor of the thermodynamic stability of nearly native structures that are to be retained for quality control iteration. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma with the exception of sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, which was purchased from Pierce, and NAP-5 desalting columns, from Amersham Biosciences. Rat liver GT was purified as described (9Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UDP-[14C]Glc (300 mCi/mmol) was synthesized as previously described (9Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression, Purification, and Glycosylation of Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 (CI2)—This study is based on the truncated form of CI2, where the first residue corresponds to Met-20 (10Jackson S.E. Moracci M. elMasry N. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11259-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CI2-(1–25), CI2-(1–40), and CI2-(1–64) were obtained as described previously (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The remaining fragments were produced by introducing a stop codon at the appropriate positions by the inverse PCR method using the pTZ18U-based vector (11Clackson T. Detlef G. Jones P.T. McPherson M.J. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR, a Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 202Google Scholar). We also introduced the substitution E7C to chemically glycosylate the proteins. Transformed Escherichia coli TG2 cultures at OD 1 were induced overnight with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 1/20volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml lysozyme. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, cells were placed in an ice bath and sonicated twice for 1 min with a Virsonic 550 sonicator; CI2s were found mainly in inclusion bodies after centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min. The inclusion bodies were washed three times with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 100 mm NaCl and then 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 m guanidinium-HCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Finally, inclusion bodies were solubilized with 15 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and 6 m urea. After centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 rpm the solutions were applied to a Superdex-75 HR16/50 column and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 4 m urea, and 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing CI2s were pooled. Trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile were added to a final concentration of 0.05 and 5%, respectively. Proteins were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C8 column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and dried in a SpeedVac. Because GT substrates are high mannose-type glycoproteins, thyroglobulin/Pronase-derived high mannose-type glycopeptides were covalently linked to the new-engineered C7 compounds by using sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate as described previously (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Glycosylated CI2s will be referred to as GCI2s. Spectroscopic Characterization of GCI2s—CD spectra were measured with a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter. We used 10 μm GCI2s in far UV and 40 μm in near UV CD. Intrinsic fluorescence and ANS binding were measured with an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrofluorimeter with 5 μm GCI2s. We used 50 μm ANS with the excitation wavelength set at 360 nm and spectra recorded from 400 to 650 nm. All spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Protein Stability—Chemical denaturation experiments were performed as described (10Jackson S.E. Moracci M. elMasry N. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11259-11269Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were detected with the excitation wavelength set at 280 nm, and spectra were recorded from 300 to 430 nm. Excitation and emission band passes were 8 and 2 nm, respectively. The fluorescence spectra center of mass values were used to describe the conformational states. Activity Assays—GT assays were carried out at 37 °C in 30 μl of 40 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 15 μm UDP-Glc (100,000 cpm of UDP-[14C]Glc, 300 mCi/mmol). Reactions were started by the addition of 2 μg of rat liver GT and stopped after 10 min by the addition 30 μl of cracking buffer at 100 °C containing 5% SDS. The samples were immediately heated for 10 min at 90 °C. An aliquot of 15 μl was run in Tricine-SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (12Schagge H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The dried gel was exposed to an LE phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h and revealed in a Storm 820 PhosphorImager. A linear relationship between density and radioactivity was obtained under conditions described. Description of the Model Neoglycoprotein System Employed— CI2 is an extremely useful model to study chaperone and GT recognition of nascent chains (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, because GT substrates are glycoproteins, the original E7 in CI2 was replaced by a cysteine (E7C) to which a high mannose-type glycopeptide derived from bovine thyroglobulin was attached through a bifunctional chemical cross-linker (glycosylated CI2s are to be referred to as GCI2s). The original glutamic acid residue is in a type III turn resembling many natural N-glycosylation sites (4Petrescu A.J. Milac A.L. Petrescu S.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It is exposed to the solvent and has no effect on full-length CI2 conformation (13McPhalen C.A. James M.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We had previously determined that a significant GT activity was only attained with the fragment of 53 residues in length, the first ones to display long range native interactions (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We now focused on GCI2 fragments having from 53 to 64 (full-length) amino acid residues. Their conformations mimic the last folding structures adopted by a glycoprotein entering the ER lumen. The acquisition of the native structure in CI2 is highly cooperative with the addition of the last two residues (Val-63 and Gly-64) (14de Prat Gay G. Ruiz-Sanz J. Neira J.L. Corrales F.J. Otzen D.E. Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although partially exposed to the solvent, Val-63 interacts with Val-47 and Trp-5 (the only tryptophan residue in CI2) in the hydrophobic core, whereas Gly-64 does so with Arg-46 and Arg-48 through ionic interactions (Fig. 1) (13McPhalen C.A. James M.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A point mutation (V63S) was also introduced because previous experiments had shown that certain mutations at that position have a destabilizing effect on CI2-(1–64) native structure (15Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 260-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Structural Characterization of Last Folding Intermediates— The center of mass of fluorescence spectra of GCI2s revealed almost no variation of tryptophan exposure to the solvent as the chain grew from GCI2-(1–53) to GCI2-(1–62), with an abrupt change upon the addition of the last two residues where the tryptophan side chain appears completely buried (Fig. 2A). Both GCI2-(1–63)V63S and GCI2-(1–64)V63S fluorescence spectra showed a shift toward longer wavelengths with respect to the canonical derivatives having Val-63. Far UV CD spectra presented only a marginal variation for derivatives ranging from GCI2-(1–53) to GCI2-(1–62), thus indicating almost no effect of the chain length on the secondary structure within that size range (Fig. 2B; only the GCI2-(1–53) is shown). On the contrary, a somewhat different spectrum was observed in GCI2-(1–64), whereas GCI2-(1–63), GCI2-(1–63)V63S, and GCI2-(1–64)V63S presented intermediate patterns between those of GCI2-(1–53) to GCI2-(1–62) and GCI2-(1–64). Although derivatives ranging from GCI2-(1–53) to GCI2-(1–63) displayed very similar near UV CD spectra (Fig. 2C; only those of GCI2-(1–53), GCI2-(1–63), and GCI2-(1–63)V63S are shown), those of GCI2-(1–64) and GCI2-(1–64)V63S were sharply different as they displayed a positive band at about 290 nm. This implied that the full-length neoglycoproteins had the Trp-5 residue located in an asymmetric environment indicative of defined three dimensional structures, in contrast with shorter fragments. In addition, only non-full-length species showed ANS binding, although GCI2-(1–64)V63S gave a slightly positive signal when compared with GCI2-(1–64) or the buffer (Fig. 2D; although not shown, GCI2-(1–53) to GCI2-(1–62) also showed ANS binding). ANS is a sensitive probe for the presence of accessible hydrophobic patches. It was concluded that the onset of native secondary and tertiary structure in GCI2s takes place in parallel when 83% of sequence information is attained (GCI2-(1–53) and that the acquisition of the compact cooperatively folded native structure occurs only upon the addition of the last two residues. Additional Structural Features of Mutant Neoglycoproteins—Chemical denaturation of GCI2-(1–63)V63S, GCI2-(1–64)V63S, and of their canonical homologues with guanidinium hydrochloride showed how the V63S mutation and removal of Gly-64 affected the stability of the parental proteins (Fig. 2E). The stability of GCI2-(1–64) and GCI2-(1–63) diminished by 1.3 and 0.2 kcal/mol, respectively, upon introduction of mutations (Table I). The destabilizing effect was more pronounced for the full-length protein, since cleavage of the C-terminal residue has a higher destabilizing effect than the V63S mutation. As we mentioned above, CI2 structure is stabilized through ionic interactions from the C terminus to Arg-46 and Arg-48. The stability differences between wild type and mutated same-length derivatives parallels the shift to longer wavelengths in the fluorescence spectra and the increased ANS binding of the mutants.Table IUnfolding parameters of neoglycoproteins m in column 2 refers to the constant from the equation ΔG[GdnHCl] = ΔGH20 + m[GdnHCl], where ΔG[GdnHCl] (GdnHCl is guanidinium hydrochloride) and ΔGH20 are the free energies of folding in water and at a given denaturant concentration.ΔGH20m[GdnHCl]50kcal mol-1kcal mol-1m-1mGCI2-(1–64)4.7 ± 0.11.28 ± 0.053.7 ± 0.2GCI2-(1–64)V63S3.4 ± 0.11.10 ± 0.033.1 ± 0.1GCI2-(1–63)1.9 ± 0.10.92 ± 0.022.1 ± 0.1GCI2-(1–63)V63S1.7 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab GT Recognizes Native-close Conformations of GCI2 Neoglycoproteins—Quantitative kinetic experiments with GT were performed because the GCI2 family remained soluble within wide concentration ranges. As shown in Fig. 3A GCI2-(1–63) and GCI2-(1–64) were much poorer substrates than the shorter fragments (values yielded by fragments not shown fell between those of GCI2-(1–53) and GCI2-(1–63)V63S). The glucose acceptor capacities of GCI2-(1–63)V63S and GCI2-(1–64)V63S were higher than those of the respective canonical fragments (GCI2-(1–63) and GCI2-(1–64). Because the C-terminal residue in GCI2-(1–64) is a glycine, the decrease in GT activity from GCI2-(1–63) to GCI2-(1–64) is not an outcome from its inhibition by a particular amino acid side chain at the C-terminal position but, rather, is a consequence of the effect of this residue on the global structure of GCI2. All efficient substrates bound ANS, supporting the idea that GT recognizes the exposition of the hydrophobic core. The slightly higher glucose acceptor capacity of GCI2-(1–64)V63S with respect to GCI2-(1–64) also correlated with a slightly higher ANS binding capacity (Fig. 2D). It is worth mentioning that we had previously reported that neither GCI2-(1–25), GCI2-(1–40), nor GCI2-(1–64) bind ANS and were poorly or not glucosylated by GT (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The GT catalytic efficiency expressed as Vmax/Km showed a clear trend when expressed as a function of the chain length (Fig. 3B); no significant variation was observed from GCI2-(1–53) to GCI2-(1–58), but a sharp decrease appeared from this species to GCI2-(1–64). Note the higher catalytic efficiency detected with GCI2-(1–63)V63S and GCI2-(1–64)V63S as substrates when compared with the respective canonical compounds. The catalytic efficiency showed a direct hyperbolic relationship with the exposure of the hydrophobic core as indicated by the intrinsic fluorescence mass center values (Fig. 3C; values for GCI2-(1–25) and GCI2-(1–40) were taken from Caramelo et al. (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). Points corresponding to GCI2-(1–25) and GCI2-(1–40) fell outside the curve. As previously determined, those fragments display disordered conformations lacking ANS binding hydrophobic patches, although their Trp-5 residues are solvent-exposed. Results observed reflected, therefore, the loss of GT recognition upon progressive consolidation of the substrate compact fold. GT Senses the Thermodynamic Stability of Close to Native Folding Intermediates—The free energy of unfolding of GCI2-(1–63)V63S, GCI2-(1–64)V63S, and of their wild type, same-length homologues revealed an inverse exponential dependence with GT catalytic efficiencies (Fig. 4A). The free energy of unfolding values of wild type and mutant neoglycoproteins covered a rather wide range, from 1.7 to 4.7 kcal/mol, the last of which closely resembles values observed for medium size monomeric proteins. Notably, the catalytic efficiencies showed a linear relationship with the population fraction of unfolded GCI2 in water (Fig. 4B; the fractions of unfolded GCI2s were calculated assuming similar free energy values for the unfolded states of all four neoglycoproteins). Results presented in Figs. 4, A and B, suggest that perhaps GT is one of the most exquisite biosensors of the stability of protein conformations described to date. In a previous report we studied the glucose acceptor capacities of four neoglycoproteins, GCI2-(1–25), GCI2-(1–40), GCI2-(1–53), and GCI2-(1–64) (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), an unstructured hydrophilic peptide, a hydrophobic peptide devoid of long range interactions, a molten globule-like, and a properly folded species, respectively. The onset of secondary and tertiary native structure occurs in GCI2-(1–53), which was the best GT substrate, and we concluded that the enzyme preferentially recognized solvent-accessible hydrophobic regions present in native-like conformations that have not reached their final compact state. Results here reported further extend our observations to additional compounds and confirm our previous conclusion, as GT catalytic efficiency showed a hyperbolic relationship with tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence center of mass but only in ANS binding (i.e. exposing hydrophobic patches) compounds (Fig. 3C). For instance GCI2-(1–40), despite displaying a stretch of highly hydrophobic amino acid residues from positions 26 to 39, lacked long range interactions, did not bind ANS, and consequently was a rather poor GT substrate. Furthermore, relationships of catalytic efficiency (Fig. 3B, inset) or ANS fluorescence of CI2s (Fig. 5 in de Prat Gay et al. (14de Prat Gay G. Ruiz-Sanz J. Neira J.L. Corrales F.J. Otzen D.E. Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) with chain length were practically super imposable. Of the several features of a molten globule conformation (mobility of the polypeptide chain, presence of secondary and tertiary structural elements, free access of the glycan to the solvent, exposure of hydrophobic amino acid patches, etc.) only the latter is not shared with GCI2s that are poor GT substrates. GT glucosylated neoglycoproteins of increasing length until the substrate displayed its full size, thus acquiring its native compact structure. However, because folding of the neoglyco-proteins employed is highly cooperative with the acquisition of the last two residues (14de Prat Gay G. Ruiz-Sanz J. Neira J.L. Corrales F.J. Otzen D.E. Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it may be argued that in other systems in which the three-dimensional structure of fragments lacking a few residues at their C terminus does not significantly differ from that of the full-length species, glucosylation might stop before acquisition of the native structure at its most minimal details. To test this possibility we introduced a point mutation in the amino acid before last (V63S), known to induce a minimal structural perturbation (15Itzhaki L.S. Otzen D.E. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 260-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Although the far UV CD spectra of GCI2-(1–64) and GCI2-(1–64)V63S showed only slight variations and changes observed for near UV CD spectra were minimal as also were their intrinsic fluorescence mass center values and the extent of ANS binding and that the energy of unfolding only showed a respective decrease from 4.7 to 3.4 kcal/mol, both compounds were differentially glucosylated by GT. Similarly, although the free energy of unfolding of GCI2-(1–63) and GCI2-(1–63)V63S only differed by 0.2 kcal/mol, both neoglycoproteins were glucosylated with sharply different catalytic efficiencies. In fact, GT catalytic efficiency showed a linear dependence with the proportion of unfolded GCI2 in water. This last parameter may be taken as an indication of the dynamic behavior of GCI2 as a higher value would indicate that a molecule occurs for longer time periods in putative unfolded conformations. The exquisite way by which GT senses the stability of glycoproteins ensures that no species displaying minimally incomplete three-dimensional structures would leave the ER. The ability of GT to discriminate between minimally differing three-dimensional structures has been recently documented also (7Taylor S.C. Ferguson A.D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Introduction of a point mutation (F280S) to exo-(1,3)-β-glucanase elicited recognition of the glycoprotein by GT presumably without significantly affecting its three-dimensional structure, as the protein remained enzymatically active. At this point we can visualize a complete picture of GT recognition of a single folding protein domain emerging into the ER lumen (inset in Fig. 3B). CI2-(1–64) has two potential BiP/Grp78 binding sites, one of them centered at Trp-5 and the other at Leu-32, the last one within a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues. Whereas the first one is abolished on linking the glycopeptide to C7, the second site remains active after glycan addition as GCI2-(1–40) (but not GCI2-(1–25) sharply enhanced BiP/Grp78 intrinsic ATPase activity (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, a molten globule-like conformation displaying optimal glucose acceptor capacity is not attained until the molecule has about 83% of its sequence information. The protein entering the ER lumen would then be N-glycosylated at position seven, recognized by BiP/Grp78 when about 35–40 amino acids are already in the lumen, and collapse on reaching a 50–53-amino acid length. Formation of the molten globule-like structure will then prevent BiP/Grp78 binding because this chaperone recognizes heptapeptides with aliphatic hydrophobic amino acids in alternating positions in proteins displaying extended conformations. As expected, GCI2-(1–53) triggered a much lower BiP/Grp78 ATPase activity than GCI2-(1–40), although both neoglycoproteins shared the same Grp/BiP binding site centered at Leu-32 (8Caramelo J.J. Castro O.A. Alonso L.G. de Prat-Gay G. Parodi A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is doubtful that immediate partial deglucosylation of the transferred glycan mediated by glucosidases I and II would elicit a long-lived CNX/CRT-GCI2 interaction; because affinity of lectins for monoglucosylated glycans is rather low (16Patil A.R. Thomas C.J. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24348-24356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it would be expected that an initial lectin binding would be followed by dissociation of the complex and glucosidases I- and II-mediated complete deglucosylation. No further glucosylation and, hence, CNX/CRT binding would occur until formation of molten globule-like conformations. Formation of these last conformations would then result in glucosylation-deglucosylation cycles lasting until the native structure at its most minimal details is attained. This interpretation is somewhat at odds with the in vivo observation that glycoproteins bearing an N-glycan within the first 50 amino acids would interact with CNX/CRT and not with BiP/Grp78 (17Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A short-lived interaction with the latter chaperone, perhaps not detectable by immunoprecipitation as it would last as the protein grows from about 35–40 until it reaches 50–53 amino acids, can conceivably take place. Furthermore, the sequential interaction, first with BiP/Grp78 and then with CNX/CRT, has been documented for several glycoproteins (17Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Tomita Y. Yamashita T. Sato H. Taira H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 1090-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). How does GT recognize nascent polypeptide substrates? We have previously determined that GT has at least two independent folding domains located at the N- and C-terminal ends, comprising 80 and 20% of the molecule, respectively. Both domains remained tightly but not covalently bound upon a mild proteolytic treatment, after which they could not be separated by common biochemical procedures without loss of enzymatic activity (21Guerin M. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20540-20546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion is the catalytic domain as it shares sequence similarity and the ability to bind UDP-Glc analogs with glycosyltransferase family 8 enzymes (22Tessier D.C. Dignard D. Zapun A. Radominska-Pandya A. Parodi A.J. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is strong evidence suggesting that the N-terminal domain is the portion recognizing the folding status of glycoprotein substrates in addition to being required for the C-terminal domain stability (21Guerin M. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20540-20546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Arnold S.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43320-43328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It may be speculated that on GT recognition of molten globule-like structures, the contact surface between N- and C-terminal domains becomes somehow partially distorted, thus, allowing binding of the substrate glycoprotein hydrophobic surface. This is highly reminiscent to what happens on Grp94 recognition of folding intermediates. Grp94 is an ER chaperone that, unlike BiP/Grp78 and the same as GT, recognizes proteins in advanced folding stages.

Probably GT inserts a portion of the N-terminal domain, normally buried in the N-terminal/C-terminal domain interphase, into the substrate native hydrophobic core. This interaction would cease when the final side chain packing of the core is attained, giving place to the stable and consolidated final structure. Experiments to address these issues through spectroscopic methods are in progress."

SP also stimulates cell proliferation, a critical event in tissue healing during chronic colitis, via transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Here we examined the mechanism by which SP induces EGFR and MAPK activation. We used non-transformed human NCM460 colonocytes stably transfected with the human NK-1R (NCM460-NK-1R cells) as well as untransfected U373 MG cells expressing high levels of endogenous NK-1R. Exposure of both cell lines to SP (10–7m) stimulated EGFR activation (1 min) followed by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) activation (2–5 min). SP-induced ERK1/2 activation was blocked by pretreatment with the metalloproteinase inhibitor Batimastat/GM6001, the EGFR phosphorylation inhibitor AG1478, and the tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitor TAPI-1. Pretreatment with antibodies against potential EGFR ligands suggested that transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), but not the other EGFR ligands EGF, heparin-binding EGF, or amphiregulin, mediates SP-induced EGFR transactivation. SP stimulated TGFα release into the extracellular space that was measurable within 2 min, and this release was inhibited by metalloproteinase inhibitors and the TACE inhibitor TAPI-1. SP also induced MAPK-mediated cell proliferation that was inhibited by TACE, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), EGFR, and MEK1 inhibitors. Thus, in human colonocytes, NK-1R-induced EGFR and MAPK activation and cell proliferation involve matrix metalloproteinases (most likely TACE) and the release of TGFα. These signaling mechanisms may be involved in the protective effects of NK-1R in chronic colitis.

However, studies with NK-1R-deficient mice also indicated that although NK-1R deletion protects mice from the acute phase of experimental colitis, all aspects of colonic inflammation were enhanced at later stages of colitis, indicating that SP may play a protective role in chronic colonic inflammation (28Al Sarraj A.

We reported previously that SP stimulation leads to activation of MAPK and increased DNA synthesis in U373 MG astrocytoma cells by a mechanism involving transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (27Castagliuolo I. Valenick L. Liu J. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26545-26550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Al-Sarrai and Thiel (28Al Sarraj A. Thiel G. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 332: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) also reported that SP via NK-1R causes transactivation of the EGFR in human glioma cells. However, whether SP transactivates EGFR in human colonocytes is not known. Moreover, the signaling mechanism(s) by which SP-NK-1R interactions lead to EGFR and MAPK activation and cell proliferation has not been identified. In this current study, we sought to identify the mechanisms of SP-induced activation of EGFR and MAPK and SP-induced cell proliferation in non-transformed human colonic epithelial cells stably transfected with NK-1R, as well as in U373 MG astrocytoma cells expressing high levels of endogenous NK-1R. Cell Culture—Non-transformed human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells stably expressing NK-1R (NCM460-NK-1R) were made by a retroviral approach using the protocol described by us previously (20Zhao D. Kuhnt-Moore S. Zeng H. Pan A. Wu J.S. Simeonidis S. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These cells possess characteristics similar to native colonocytes and have been used by us to study NK-1R signaling (20Zhao D. Kuhnt-Moore S. Zeng H. Pan A. Wu J.S. Simeonidis S. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). NCM460 and NCM460-NK-1R cells were cultured in M3D medium (INCELL Corporation, San Antonio, CA) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) solution. U373 MG astrocytoma cells expressing high levels of endogenous NK-1R (27Castagliuolo I. Valenick L. Liu J. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26545-26550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 10 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma). Cell Signaling Experiments—NCM460, NCM460-NK-1R, and U373 MG cells seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells/well were incubated overnight in serum-free M3D (NCM460 and NCM460-NK-1R cells) or minimal essential medium (U373 MG cells) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were then pretreated with the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (0.4 μm) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), the metalloproteinase inhibitors Batimastat (3 μg/ml) (BB94, British Biotech, Oxford, UK), GM6001 (8 μm) (Calbiochem), the TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitor TAPI-1 (8 μm) (Calbiochem), the MAPK kinase (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm) (Calbiochem), or Me2SO for 30 min and then stimulated with SP, vehicle (control), or in some experiments EGF (20 ng/ml) (positive control for EGFR activation) for the time points indicated in Fig. 1. In some experiments, NCM460-NK-1R or U373 MG cells were treated with either 8 μm MMP2/9 inhibitor or 8 μm CL-82198 (Calbiochem), and SP (10–7m)-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was determined by Western blot analysis. To determine the role of EGFR and its ligands in SP-induced EGFR and MAPK activation, serum-starved NCM460-NK-1R cells and U373 MG cells were pretreated with either control IgG (20 μg/ml) or antibodies against EGFR (20 μg/ml), EGF (20 μg/ml), HB-EGF (20 μg/ml), TGFα (20 μg/ml), or amphiregulin (20 μg/ml) (R&D Systems Inc., Minnesota, MN) for 1 h, followed by incubation with SP (10–7m) for 15 min. Western blot analyses of cell lysates were used to determine the levels of ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, and/or phospho-EGFR as described below. Western Blot Analysis—SP-treated cells were lysed in 1× lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol). Equal amounts of cell extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 400 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with antibodies directed against phospho-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), ERK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. The peroxidase signal was detected by Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and the image of the signal was exposed to x-ray film (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). In some experiments, Western blot bands were quantified by densitometry and Scion image analysis software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD) with normalization of the phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-EGFR phosphorylated bands to the corresponding band of control signal (ERK1/2) from the same samples. TGFα ELISA—TGFα protein levels were determined by double ligand ELISA using goat anti-human TGFα (R&D Systems Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions (minimal detection limit of 0.5 pg/ml). Results were expressed as means ± S.E. (pg/ml). Cell Proliferation Assay—NCM460-NK-1R cells were seeded on 96-well plates (1 × 106 cells/plate). Serum-starved NCM460-NK-1R cells in 100 μl/well medium were pretreated with PD98059 (25 μm), AG1478 (2 μm), GM6001 (20 μm), TAPI-1 (20 μm), or vehicle (Me2SO) for 30 min and then exposed to SP (10–7m), EGF (20 ng/ml), or TGFα (20 ng/ml). After 24 h, 20 μl of CellTiter AQueous One solution (MTS tetrazolium compound) (Promega) were added into each well and incubated for 1 h. The color changes resulting from the increased cell number were detected by reading absorbance at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Statistical Analysis—ELISA results were analyzed using the Prism professional statistics software program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used for intergroup comparison. SP Stimulates Phosphorylation of the EGFR and ERK in a Time- and Dose-dependent Manner—SP-NK-1R interactions participate in colonic mucosa healing during colitis presumably by stimulating EGFR-mediated colonic fibroblast proliferation (29Castagliuolo I. Morteau O. Keates A.C. Valenick L. Wang C.C. Zacks J. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Pothoulakis C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of SP-induced EGFR and ERK1/2 activation in colonic epithelial cells, we used non-transformed human colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, either non-transfected or stably transfected with NK-1R (NCM460-NK-1R). NCM460-NK-1R cells were used previously to study the signaling mechanisms by which substance P induces IL-8 expression (20Zhao D. Kuhnt-Moore S. Zeng H. Pan A. Wu J.S. Simeonidis S. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using a semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR for human NK-1R mRNA (30Simeonidis S. Castagliuolo I. Pan A. Liu J. Wang C.C. Mykoniatis A. Pasha A. Valenick L. Sougioultzis S. Zhao D. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2957-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found that NCM460 cells express NK-1R as shown by the presence of a 324-bp DNA fragment that corresponded to the full-length human NK-1R cDNA (data not shown). We also verified the authenticity of the PCR product by sequencing analysis (data not shown). To examine whether SP causes EGFR transactivation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NCM460-NK-1R and NCM460 cells were treated with SP (10–7m) for the indicated time points. Cells were then lysed, and equal amounts of cell proteins were subjected to Western blot analyses using antibodies directed against tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR or dual phospho-ERK1/2. In non-transfected NCM460 cells, SP did not induce significant EGFR or ERK1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown), indicating low levels of expression of NK-1R in these cells as indicated previously (20Zhao D. Kuhnt-Moore S. Zeng H. Pan A. Wu J.S. Simeonidis S. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, in NCM460-NK-1R cells, SP induced a transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR that was detectable as early as 1 min after SP exposure, peaked at 5 min, and returned to control levels at 45 min (Fig. 1A). SP also induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 that was evident at 2 min and with maximal intensity at 5–10 min (Fig. 1A). This result is consistent with the notion that the ERK1/2 pathway is downstream of EGFR (27Castagliuolo I. Valenick L. Liu J. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26545-26550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To confirm these responses in cells expressing high levels of endogenous NK-1R we used U373 MG cells. Our results show that SP induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation as early as 1 min, with maximal intensity at 5–10 min (Fig. 1B). The phospho-ERK signal was predominantly an ERK2 signal because it was correlated to a higher expression level of the ERK2 p42 subunit (Fig. 1B). As expected, exposure of both cell types to EGF (20 ng/ml) induced ERK1/2 and EGFR phosphorylation in a similar fashion as in NK-1R-transfected and non-transfected U373 MG cells (Fig. 1), as well as in non-transfected NCM460 cells (data not shown), indicating intact EGFR and ERK1/2 pathways in all cell lines. Next, NCM460-NK-1R and U373 MG cells were treated with different concentrations of SP for 15 min, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, SP, at concentrations ranging between 10–6 and 10–9m, stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas 10–10m SP had no significant effect. EGFR- and Metalloproteinase-dependent Pathways Are Involved in SP-induced MAPK Activation—To confirm the role of EGFR in SP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human colonocytes, we pretreated NCM460-NK-1R cells and U373 MG cells with either a neutralizing antibody directed against EGFR or a control IgG (20 μg/ml) for 30 min and then exposed the cells to SP (10–7m) for 15 min. Our results showed that pretreatment with anti-EGFR neutralizing antibody, but not control IgG, significantly inhibited SP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3), indicating that SP induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation via the EGFR pathway. It is known that EGF receptor transactivation by several G-protein-coupled receptors involves cleavage of precursors of EGF receptor ligands by metalloproteinases (31Buteau J. Foisy S. Joly E. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 32Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

To determine whether SP-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation requires metalloproteinase activity, NCM460-NK-1R and U373 MG cells were pretreated with the broad metalloproteinase inhibitors Batimastat (BB94, 3 μg/ml) and GM6001 (8 μm), the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (0.4 μm), or a TACE inhibitor (TAPI-1, 8 μm) for 30 min and then stimulated with SP (10–7m) for various time points. We found that BB94 and GM6001 inhibited SP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). In addition, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (0.4 μm) and the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm) also completely inhibited SP-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). The TACE inhibitor TAPI-1 also blocked SP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Preliminary Western blot experiments showed that TACE is highly expressed in NCM460-NK-1R cells (data not shown). SP Stimulates TGFα Release, Which Activates EGFR—Our experiments described above (Figs. 3 and 4) indicate that SP-induced EGFR phosphorylation involves an extracellular ligand for the EGFR. It is well established that EGF (34Modjtahedi H. Komurasaki T. Toyoda H. Dean C. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), HB-EGF (35Wallasch C. Crabtree J.E. Bevec D. Robinson P.A. Wagner H. Ullrich A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), TGFα (36Borrell-Pages M. Rojo F. Albanell J. Baselga J. Arribas J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and amphiregulin (37Johnson G.R. Kannan B. Shoyab M. Stromberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2924-2931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) represent the four ligands that bind and activate the EGFR. To identify the EGFR ligand(s) participating in SP-NK-1R signaling, NCM460-NK-1R cells were exposed to antibodies directed against EGF, HB-EGF, TGFα, and amphiregulin or control antibodies for 1 h prior to SP (10–7m) stimulation. After 15 min, cell lysates were processed for Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against phosphorylated EGFR. Our results showed that SP-induced EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by anti-TGFα neutralizing antibodies, but not by control IgG nor by antibodies directed against the other EGFR ligands, in both NCM460-NK-1R (Fig. 5A) and U373 MG (Fig. 5B) cells. Densitometric analysis of the results from NCM460-NK-1R cells showed that compared with control IgG, the TGFα neutralizing antibody significantly reduced SP-induced phospho-EGFR and phospho-ERK1/2 activation by 63 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 5C). However, neutralizing antibodies against EGF, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin had no inhibitory effect in SP-induced phospho-EGFR and phospho-ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5, A and B). To confirm and further explore the results with the TGFα neutralizing antibody (Fig. 5C) we examined whether SP directly stimulated TGFα release from its membrane-bound form into the extracellular space. To do this, NCM460-NK-1R (Fig. 6A) and U373 MG (Fig. 6B) cells were treated with SP for the indicated time intervals, and TGFα levels were measured in the conditioned media by ELISA. Compared with non-stimulated cells, SP induced a prompt release of TGFα into the media, which reached the maximal level within 2 min and remained elevated after 10 min (Fig. 6). As expected (38Ramesh G. Levine A.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at 1 μm also stimulated increased TGFα levels in both cell types (∼3-fold, data not shown). Moreover, the MMP inhibitors Batimastat and GM6001 and the TACE inhibitor TAPI-1 prevented SP-induced TGFα release (Fig. 6). TGFα release in GM6001-pretreated U373 MG cells without SP stimulation was below the detection limit of the assay (Fig. 6B). Thus, SP-induced release of TGFα is metalloproteinase-dependent. SP Stimulates Colonic Epithelial Cell Proliferation via MMP-, EGFR-, and MAPK-dependent Pathways—Although SP was known to induce DNA synthesis in U373 MG astrocytoma cells (27Castagliuolo I. Valenick L. Liu J. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26545-26550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), a similar mitogenic SP response has not been investigated in normal colonic epithelial cells. Using a MTS-based cell proliferation assay, SP (10–7m) was found to significantly increase cell proliferation by ∼18% within 24 h of exposure (Fig. 7A, **, p < 0.01), which was almost completely abolished by inhibition of MEK1 with 25 μm PD98059 (Fig. 7A, *, p < 0.05). PD98059 pretreatment without addition of SP did not significantly affect cell viability. Exposure to EGF (20 ng/ml) and TGFα (20 ng/ml), serving as positive controls, also stimulated a similar PD98059-sensitive mitogenic response (Fig. 7A, ***, p < 0.001). Inhibition of EGFR, MMPs, and TACE by AG1478, GM6001, and TAPI-1, respectively, also blocked SP-induced mitogenesis to basal level (Fig. 7B, *, p < 0.05). Previous studies with NK-1R-deficient mice indicated that the NK-1R plays an important protective role in the healing phase of experimental colitis (28Al Sarraj A. Thiel G. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 332: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and presented evidence in mouse colonic fibroblasts that activation of EGFR may participate in this response in a NK-1R-dependent manner (28Al Sarraj A. Thiel G. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 332: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have also shown that SP can stimulate proliferation of human astrocytoma cells via an EGFR-dependent MAPK pathway (27Castagliuolo I. Valenick L. Liu J. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26545-26550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, whether similar NK-1R-dependent signaling events can take place in human colonocytes, an important cell target for the development of colitis, is not known. Most importantly, the upstream NK-1R-dependent signaling pathways leading to EGFR and MAPK activation have not been studied. We now report the new finding that in non-transformed human colonic epithelial cells, SP induces EGFR and MAPK activation via a metalloproteinase-dependent pathway. Our results suggest that NK-1R engagement by SP leads to activation of metalloproteinases that specifically cleave proTGFα, which is plasma membrane-bound. Active TGFα is then released into the medium that subsequently binds and activates the EGFR receptor, leading to ERK1/2 signaling. Although SP has been demonstrated to induce cell proliferation in U373 MG astrocytoma cells (27Castagliuolo I. Valenick L. Liu J. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26545-26550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and transformed colonic epithelial Caco2 cells (39Goode T. O'Connor T. Hopkins A. Moriarty D. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. O'Donoghue D. Baird A.W. O'Connell J. Shanahan F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we now present evidence that SP induces cell proliferation in non-transformed colonic epithelial cells and that this proliferation is linked to EGFR and MAPK activation following NK-1R engagement. Our data demonstrating that these responses can be reproduced in another cell line expressing high levels of endogenous NK-1R (U373 MG cells) provide physiological relevance to the results obtained with NK-1R-transfected NCM460 cells. Our results demonstrate that SP-induced EGFR transactivation can be blocked by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Batimastat and GM6001, indicating that membrane metalloproteinases are involved in this SP-dependent signaling event. Several metalloproteinases are available in cells for shedding of EGFR ligands, and different metalloproteinases are capable of shedding more than one EGFR ligand. For example, HB-EGF can be cleaved by a variety of metalloproteinases such as MMP3 (40Suzuki M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31730-31737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), MMP7 (41Yu W.H. Woessner Jr., J.F. McNeish J.D. Stamenkovic I.

Our results with neutralizing antibodies demonstrate that among several EGFR ligands, only a TGFα antibody inhibited SP-induced EGFR phosphorylation. Together with our finding that SP exposure of NCM460-NK-1R colonocytes leads to a rapid release of mature TGFα into the medium, our results strongly suggest that TGFα may be the only EGF receptor ligand responsible for SP-induced EGFR activation in these cells. The specific metalloproteinase(s) responsible for cleaving proTGFα to mature TGFα in response to SP appears to be TACE, which was originally known to cleave TNFα but then was found to be the only matrix metalloproteinase to efficiently shed proTGFα, leading to the release of its mature form (46Hinkle C.L. Mohan M.J. Lin P. Yeung N. Rasmussen F. Milla M.E. Moss M.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We report here that the TACE inhibitor, TAPI-1, diminished SP-induced TGFα release and subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in NCM460-NK-1R cells, indicating that SP-induced TGFα release and MAPK activation were mediated by TACE. Although we did not have the opportunity to examine the participation of all metalloproteinases in SP-induced TGFα-related EGFR and MAPK signaling, experiments with the MMP2/9 inhibitor (8 μm), which blocks both MMP2 and MMP9, and with CL-82198 (8 μm), an inhibitor of MMP13, did not affect SP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in either NCM460-NK-1R or U373 MG cells (data not shown). Thus, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP13 are not likely to mediate SP-induced MAPK activation. Results in this study and prior studies indicate that SP-induced MAPK activation requires the presence of a functional EGFR kinase domain (27Castagliuolo I. Valenick L. Liu J. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26545-26550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies with G-protein-coupled receptors that transactivate EGFR indicate that the EGFR signaling pathway is linked to Ras activation (47Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Our results indicating that NK-1R engagement leads to transactivation of the EGF receptor in colonocytes are in line with our prior finding demonstrating that NK-1R stimulation leads to activation of Ras (20Zhao D. Kuhnt-Moore S. Zeng H. Pan A. Wu J.S. Simeonidis S. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our finding that EGF receptor transactivation is responsible for SP-induced ERK1/2 activation is also consistent with results indicating that Ras may be involved in SP-induced MAPK stimulation and cell proliferation (48Yang C.M. Hsiao L.D. Chien C.S. Lin C.C. Luo S.F. Wang C.C. Cell. Signalling. 2002; 14: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous results with non-intestinal cells also demonstrated that the proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of SP required the formation of a scaffolding complex comprising internalized receptor, β-arrestin, src, and ERK1/2. The relationship of the SP-mediated EGFR-dependent ERK1/2 activation observed in our study to the NK-1R-related scaffolding complex reported by DeFea et al. (26DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D. O'Bryan E.M. Nishijima D. Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) remains to be elucidated. SP failed to induce MAPK activation or EGFR transactivation in non-transfected NCM460 colonocytes. On the other hand, we were able to detect NK-1R mRNA in these cells. These results are consistent with low levels of expression of NK-1R in several cell types, including colonic epithelial cells. For example, Goode et al. (39Goode T. O'Connor T. Hopkins A. Moriarty D. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. O'Donoghue D. Baird A.W. O'Connell J. Shanahan F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) indicated that although several colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines were negative for NK-1R mRNA and protein, NK-1R could be induced upon exposure to a mixture of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, SP was also able to induce a mitotic response only in cytokine-exposed and not in untreated colonic epithelial SW620 cells (39Goode T. O'Connor T. Hopkins A. Moriarty D. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. O'Donoghue D. Baird A.W. O'Connell J. Shanahan F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory also indicate that the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα can induce expression of the human NK-1R in monocytic THP-1 cells at the protein and mRNA level (30Simeonidis S. Castagliuolo I. Pan A. Liu J. Wang C.C. Mykoniatis A. Pasha A. Valenick L. Sougioultzis S. Zhao D. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2957-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Along these lines expression of functional NK-1R is only evident in lamina propria macrophages isolated from inflamed, but not from normal, intestine (10Castagliuolo I. Keates A.C. Qiu B. Kelly C.P. Nikulasson S. Leeman S.E. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4788-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, our results using NK-1R-transfected NCM460 cells may be pathophysiologically relevant taking also into account that increased levels of NK-1R expression have been noted in several forms of intestinal inflammation in animals and humans, including C. difficile colitis and inflammatory bowel disease (8Goldin E.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In summary, we present evidence indicating that the mechanism of SP-NK-1R-mediated EGFR transactivation in colonic epithelial cells involves activation of TAPI-1-sensitive matrix metalloproteinases (most likely TACE) able to cleave the membrane-bound precursor proTGFα, leading to shedding of its mature form to the extracellular space. TGFα in turn engages the EGFR, causing its activation and leading to MAPK signaling, which induces colonic epithelial and astrocytoma cell proliferation. This novel pathway may also participate in SP-related cell proliferation in various cell types, as well as in mucosal healing during colonic inflammation. Lastly, these NK-1R signaling events may also be important in the growing evidence for involvement of SP and NK-1R in the development and progression of tumor growth of various etiologies, including pancreatic cancer (51Friess H.

https://openalex.org/W2125107066,"Caloric restriction (CR) has been found to extend the life spans of a wide variety of species, transcending phylogenetic boundaries. The objective of this study was to test the generality of this phenomenon, using the male housefly as an insect model in which food intake can be quantified precisely. Sucrose was found to promote a longer life span than diets additionally containing proteins and lipids. Flies were fed sucrose or a more complex diet ad libitum (AL), or in amounts ranging from 50% to 100% of the average amount consumed by young flies. CR shortened rather than prolonged the life span of houseflies, particularly flies fed sucrose only. The rate of oxygen consumption was not affected by caloric restriction or by the exclusion of proteins and lipids from the diet, and the reproductive activity of male flies remained unchanged by sucrose feeding. Thus, it is unlikely that the life-shortening effects of CR can be explained either in terms of an adaptive response in metabolic rate or use of a suboptimal food source. Results of this study contradict the widely held view that CR has a life-extending effect in all species."
https://openalex.org/W2102746809,"The biogenesis of biological membranes hinges on the coordinated trafficking of membrane lipids between distinct cellular compartments. The bacterial outer membrane enzyme PagP confers resistance to host immune defenses by transferring a palmitate chain from a phospholipid to the lipid A (endotoxin) component of lipopolysaccharide. PagP is an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel, preceded by an N-terminal amphipathic α-helix. The active site is localized inside the β-barrel and is aligned with the lipopolysaccharide-containing outer leaflet, but the phospholipid substrates are normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the asymmetric outer membrane. We examined the possibility that PagP activity in vivo depends on the aberrant migration of phospholipids into the outer leaflet. We find that brief addition to Escherichia coli cultures of millimolar EDTA, which is reported to replace a fraction of lipopolysaccharide with phospholipids, rapidly induces palmitoylation of lipid A. Although expression of the E. coli pagP gene is induced during Mg2+ limitation by the phoPQ two-component signal transduction pathway, EDTA-induced lipid A palmitoylation occurs more rapidly than pagP induction and is independent of de novo protein synthesis. EDTA-induced lipid A palmitoylation requires functional MsbA, an essential ATP-binding cassette transporter needed for lipid transport to the outer membrane. A potential role for the PagP α-helix in phospholipid translocation to the outer leaflet was excluded by showing that α-helix deletions are active in vivo. Neither EDTA nor Mg2+-EDTA stimulate PagP activity in vitro.

Neither EDTA nor Mg2+-EDTA stimulate PagP activity in vitro. These findings suggest that PagP remains dormant in outer membranes until Mg2+ limitation promotes the migration of phospholipids into the outer leaflet. Biological membranes are built from diverse lipids and proteins. Much information has been gained on the incorporation of proteins into membranes, but the trafficking of lipids during membrane biogenesis is poorly understood (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Huijbregts R.P. de Kroon A.I. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and 2Kol M.A. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lipid biosynthesis is restricted primarily to the cytosolic leaflets of either the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotic cells or the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane in bacteria. Membrane biogenesis thus depends on distinct lipid trafficking events including lateral diffusion, translocation between opposite leaflets (known also as flip-flop), and wholesale transport to distinct cellular compartments. Both lipid translocation and lipid transport are dependent on membrane proteins that may or may not utilize cellular energy (2Kol M.A. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lipid transport in eukaryotes proceeds through the budding and fusion of vesicles (3Nickel W. Brugger B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3235-3240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or, less frequently, through sites of membrane contact (4Shiao Y.J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Horstman A.L. Kuehn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12489-12496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the peptidoglycan or murein layer is thought to prevent vesicle transport from bacterial cytoplasmic membranes. Possible roles for membrane contact sites or lipid transfer proteins in Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane biogenesis are subjects of current debate (1Huijbregts R.P. de Kroon A.I. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Lipid trafficking during biogenesis of the bacterial outer membrane begins with the biosynthesis of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid; PBS, phosphate buffered saline. in the inner membrane (1Huijbregts R.P. de Kroon A.I. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar). Passive translocation of phospholipids to the external leaflet of the inner membrane depends on the transmembrane α-helical segments of certain integral membrane proteins (9Kol M.A. van Dalen A. de Kroon A.I. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24586-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An essential ATP-binding cassette transporter, or traffic-ATPase, MsbA is believed to translocate LPS across the inner membrane (10Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 11Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

The precise mechanism by which lipids are then transported to the outer membrane is unknown, but conditional mutants defective in MsbA have been shown recently to accumulate both phospholipids and LPS in the inner membrane (11Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It has been known for over 25 years that phospholipids rapidly exchange between the inner and outer membranes, whereas the transport of LPS is unidirectional (15Jones N.C. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7405-7412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the organization of lipids in the outer membrane is highly asymmetric, with LPS located exclusively in the extracellular outer leaflet and phospholipids normally restricted to the periplasmic inner leaflet (16Kamio Y. Nikaido H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2561-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The asymmetric lipid organization of the outer membrane depends on the presence of divalent cations, particularly Mg2+ and Ca2+, which bridge negatively charged phosphate groups in the LPS (17Schindler M. Osborn M.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4425-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 18Coughlin R.T. Tonsager S. McGroarty E.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2002-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Removal of divalent cations with chelating agents such as EDTA can strip a fraction of LPS from the cell surface (19Leive L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 109-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence indicates that EDTA promotes the translocation of phospholipids to the outer membrane outer leaflet (20Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar, 21Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, phospholipids lost from the inner leaflet during EDTA treatment are likely replenished by lipid transport from the cytoplasmic membrane. PagP is an outer membrane enzyme that transfers a palmitate chain from the sn-1 position of a phospholipid to position 2 of the lipid A (endotoxin) component of LPS (22Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5071-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Lipid A is built in the cytosolic leaflet of the inner membrane from a β-1′,6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine that is acylated with (R)-3-hydroxymyristate at the 2-, 3-, 2′-, and 3′-positions and is phosphorylated at the 1- and 4′-positions. Two units of 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo) are attached to the 6′-position, followed by the formation of acyloxyacyl linkages with laurate and myristate chains at the 2′- and 3′-positions, respectively (8Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar). The resultant hexa-acylated Kdo2-lipid A or Re endotoxin (Fig. 1) is the simplest chemotype of LPS that can be transported to the outer membrane, although the structure is normally further glycosylated and phosphorylated to complete the core oligosaccharide before MsbA translocates the complex to the periplasmic leaflet of the inner membrane. The antigenic O-polysaccharide is usually attached in the periplasmic space to the distal sugar of the core oligosaccharide before transport to the outer membrane, but most laboratory strains of E. coli K12 do not synthesize the O-antigen. During infection, endotoxin is sensed by the immune system and can elicit a cascade of cytokine production that may lead to septic shock as a consequence of massive inflammation (23Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). However, palmitoylated lipid A functions as an endotoxin antagonist in human cell lines by interfering with the toll-like receptor 4 inflammatory signaling pathway (24Tanamoto K. Azumi S. J.

The oligonucleotide primers used for DNA sequencing and PCR gene amplification were manufactured by Invitrogen and are described in Table III. Purification of plasmids, PCR products, and restriction fragments was performed with the QIAprep, QIAquick, and QIAEX II kits, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was purified using the Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed at the ACGT Corp. sequencing facility (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). PCR gene amplification was performed with 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase in a volume of 50 μl of the supplied buffer with 100 ng of template DNA, 150 ng of the appropriate primers (Table III), and 10 μm dNTPs. After initial denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at the appropriate annealing temperature, and 2 min at 72 °C were performed and then followed by 10 min at 72 °C. Inverse PCR (43Xu Y. Gong Z.

The Rtem β-lactamase gene from pUC19 was amplified by using the primers RTEM5NcoI and RTEM3SphI (Table III) at an annealing temperature of 50 °C, and cloned in the reverse orientation into the pagP gene of pCrcHB by NcoI/SphI digestion to create pPagAp. The disrupted pagP::amp allele in pPagAp was cloned into pMAK705 (Table II) by HindIII/SstI digestion to create pPagAp705. Replacement of the chromosomal pagP gene in E. coli MC1061 with the pagP::amp allele in pPagAp705 was performed by allelic exchange as described by Hamilton et al. (44Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Allelic exchange was verified by PCR using genomic DNA template and the primers pagP1 and pagP2 (Table III) at an annealing temperature of 52 °C. The PCR product was sequenced using the same primers to verify the presence of the expected Rtem ligation junctions. The pagP gene under control of its endogenous promoter was amplified from pCrcHD, using the primers HD5HindIII and HD3BamHI (Table III) at an annealing temperature of 52 °C, and cloned into pACYC184 (Table II) by HindIII/BamHI digestion to create pACPagP. The pagP promoter was amplified from pCrcHB, using the primers HB5EcoRI and HB3BamHI (Table III) at an annealing temperature of 46 °C with 200 μm dNTPs, and cloned in pRS551 (Table II) by EcoRI/BamHI digestion to create pPagP551. Fusion junctions were verified by sequencing using the primers opf1 and ofp2 (Table III). Recombination of pPagP551 with λRS45 (Table II) to create λRS45pagP551, and integration of λRS45pagP551 into the chromosomal attB locus, was performed using procedures described by Hand and Silhavy (45Hand N.J. Silhavy T.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 11-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Verification of single copy prophage integration was achieved by PCR using the procedure of Powell et al. (46Powell B.S. Rivas M.P. Court D.L. Nakamura Y. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5765-5766Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), with Taq polymerase and the primers attB, attP, and int at 500 nm (Table III). β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the procedure of Miller (39Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), using cells that were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to prevent interference from EDTA in the assay. Analysis of Lipid A by TLC—Analysis of lipid A released by mild acid hydrolysis from 32Pi-labeled cells was adapted from Zhou et al. (47Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). An overnight culture grown at 37 °C was diluted 100-fold into 5 ml of LB broth containing appropriate antibiotics and 5 μCi/ml 32Pi and was allowed to grow at 37 °C for 3 h, unless indicated otherwise. The 32P-labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 5 ml of PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 0.8 ml of PBS and converted into a single-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture (48Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) by adding 2 ml of methanol and 1 ml of chloroform. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the insoluble material was collected by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge. The pellet was washed once with 5 ml of a fresh single-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture, consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8, v/v). This pellet was then dispersed in 1.8 ml of 12.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 1% SDS, with sonic irradiation in a bath apparatus. The mixture was incubated at 100 °C for 30 min to cleave the ketosidic linkage between Kdo and the distal glucosamine sugar of lipid A. After cooling, the boiled mixture was converted to a two-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture by adding 2 ml of chloroform and 2 ml of methanol. Partitioning was made by centrifugation, and the lower phase material was collected and washed once with 4 ml of the upper phase derived from a fresh neutral two-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture, consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (2:2:1.8, v/v). The lower phase lipid A sample was collected and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The lipid A sample was dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v), and an ∼1000 cpm portion of the sample was applied to the origin of a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate. TLC was conducted in a developing tank in the solvent of chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v). The plate was dried and visualized with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Lipid A was similarly analyzed in the culture medium, following treatment of the cells with or without EDTA, with some modifications from the above procedure. Ten μCi/ml 32Pi was added to 5 ml of LB, and the subcultured bacteria were allowed to grow for 130 min. The 32P-labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature and washed once with 5 ml of LB medium prewarmed at 37 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of prewarm"

Here, we examine the chromatin structural changes associated with IL10 gene transcription by naïve and differentiated murine T cells. Naïve T cells lack DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites in the vicinity of the IL10 gene, whereas differentiated T cells display a strong 3′ constitutive HS site as well as several inducible sites. The majority of HS sites map to regions that are strongly conserved in sequence between mouse and human genomes. In committed Th1 cells, the mechanism of IL10 gene silencing is associated with the development of repressive histone modifications near the IL10 promoter and also near intronic hypersensitive regions of the IL10 gene. Our results constitute the first report of chromatin structural differences within the IL10 gene in differentiated Th1 and Th2 cells and emphasize the surprising diversity of mechanisms used to regulate cytokine gene expression at the chromatin level.

It is produced by many cell types, including T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. IL-10 makes a positive contribution to the growth and differentiation of B cells, mast cells, granulocytes, dendritic cells, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells but inhibits a broad spectrum of the functions of activated macrophages and monocytes, including nitric oxide production, the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, and the expression of the costimulatory receptors CD80 and CD86 (see Ref. 1Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5297) Google Scholar for a review). IL-10 inhibits NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α), while stimulating the production of cytokine inhibitors (e.g. the IL-1 receptor antagonist and the soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor) by monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils (2Salazar-Onfray F. Med. Oncol. 1999; 16: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). IL-10-deficient mice develop severe chronic enterocolitis (inflammatory bowel disease), emphasizing the protective role of this cytokine in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Paradoxically, however, IL-10 stimulates polyclonal B cell activation and, thus, has a pathogenic role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); indeed, anti-IL-10 treatment ameliorates disease in a subset of human SLE patients. At least two types of T helper (Th) cells, Th1 and Th2, have been distinguished based on their cytokine expression profiles (see Ref. 3Fickenscher H. Hor S. Kupers H. Knappe A. Wittmann S. Sticht H. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar for a review). Both of these cells are derived from a common precursor, i.e. naïve CD4 T cells that have not yet encountered antigen. When naïve T cells are stimulated through their T cell receptors in the presence of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-γ, they differentiate to produce IFN-γ but not IL-4 or IL-10; in contrast, when the same cells are stimulated in the presence of IL-4, they differentiate to show the converse pattern of cytokine production, producing IL-4 and IL-10 but not IFN-γ. These mutually exclusive patterns of cytokine production are predominantly observed in fully committed Th1 and Th2 cells that have been exposed to differentiating stimuli ex vivo under conditions where differentiation can be driven by high concentrations of T cell antigen receptor stimulation and polarizing cytokines. T cell clones made from these polarized cell populations are ideal for biochemical studies of gene expression, because they can be maintained by culture in the presence of the growth factor IL-2. In particular, Th1 and Th2 clones have been very useful in demonstrating that the IL4 and IFNγ genes bear opposing chromatin modifications depending on the direction of polarization (4Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Th1 cells develop a strongly silenced chromatin configuration on the IL4 gene but display an “open” chromatin configuration characterized by increased DNase I hypersensitivity and histone acetylation on the IFNγ gene; similarly, Th2 cells develop an active chromatin configuration and a complex pattern of DNase I hypersensitivity on the IL4 gene, while at the same time silencing the IFNγ gene (6Ansel K.M. Lee D.U. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The expanded IL-10 family includes several viral members as well as the IL-10-related cytokines IL-19, IL-20, IL-22 (IL-TIF), IL-24 (MDA-7), and IL-26 (AK155). By sequence alignment, these cytokines display up to ∼30% amino acid sequence identity to IL-10 (up to ∼80% for the viral homologues) (3Fickenscher H. Hor S. Kupers H. Knappe A. Wittmann S. Sticht H.

Based on the strong similarity between their crystal structures, IL-10 belongs to the same cytokine family as IFN-γ (7Zdanov A. Schalk-Hihi C. Gustchina A. Tsang M. Weatherbee J. Wlodawer A. Structure. 1995; 3: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and the genes for the IL-10/IFN-γ family are clustered on two chromosomes, emphasizing their relatively recent divergence during evolution. The genes encoding IL-22 and IL-26 are located in the close vicinity of the IFNγ gene on chromosome 12q15, whereas the genes for IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 are located in a second cluster flanked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase activated protein 2 (MAPKAP2) and TOSO (a regulator of Fas-induced apoptosis) genes; this cluster spans an ∼195-kb region of human chromosome 1q31– 32, which is syntenic to mouse chromosome 1E4 (Fig. 1). Although the immunoregulatory role of IL-10 has been extensively studied for decades, little information is available on the molecular mechanism of its transcriptional regulation, especially at the chromatin level. As a first approach to this question, we have examined the pattern of DNase I hypersensitivity in and around the IL10 gene in naïve and differentiated T cells. We show that whereas naïve T cells show no DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites in the vicinity of the IL10 gene, differentiated T cells display a strong 3′ constitutive HS site as well as several inducible sites. Essentially, all of the HS sites correspond to conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) regions identified by sequence comparisons of mammalian genomes; but the pattern of inducible HS sites differs in Th1 and Th2 cells, which silence and express the IL10 gene, respectively. Committed Th1 cells develop repressive histone modifications at the IL10 promoter and at intronic hypersensitive regions of the IL10 gene, whereas committed Th2 cells develop an open chromatin configuration at the IL10 promoter and do not display the intronic hypersensitive sites. These data constitute the first report of chromatin structural changes that correlate with IL10 gene transcription. Mice—DO11.10 mice (transgenic for an αβ T cell antigen receptor specific for the OVA323–339 peptide) on a BALB/c background were maintained in pathogen-free conditions in barrier facilities at the Center for Animal Resources and Comparative Medicine, Harvard Medical School. Cell Lines and Primary T Cells—The murine D5 Th1 clone (Ar-5) (8Rao A. Faas S.J. Cantor H. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the D10 Th2 clone (D10.G4.1) (9Kaye J. Porcelli S. Tite J. Jones B. Janeway C.A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 836-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) were maintained as described previously (5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). CD4 T cells were purified from DO11.10 mice and differentiated under Th1 and Th2 conditions for 1–2 weeks (4Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Agarwal S. Avni O. Rao A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated for the indicated times with 2 μm ionomycin alone or 10 nm PMA plus 2 μm ionomycin in the presence or absence of 1 μm CsA. Analysis of DNase I Hypersensitivity and DNA Methylation—Cells were stimulated for 4 h as described above, and nuclei were isolated and incubated with DNase I (22Siebenlist U. Durand D.B. Bressler P. Holbrook N.J. Norris C.A. Kamoun M. Kant J.A. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3042-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Purified genomic DNAs were completely digested with BamHI and resolved on a 0.6% agarose gel, transferred to Nytran membranes, and hybridized with IL-10 exon 1, exon 3, or exon 5 probes labeled by random priming. For methylation analysis of Th1 (D5) and Th2 (D10) clones, genomic DNAs were prepared and digested completely with BamHI. The DNAs were purified and further digested with methylation-sensitive (HpaII; 100 units) or -insensitive (MspI) enzymes. Digested samples were further processed for Southern analysis with indicated IL-10 exon probes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP analysis was carried out essentially as described (23Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Th1 (D5) or Th2 (D10) cells (108) were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 20 min with PMA (10 nm) plus ionomycin (2 μm) and then cross-linked using formaldehyde. This early time point was chosen based on the early kinetics of IL-10 gene transcription (peak transcript levels attained at 20 min in both the D10 Th2 clone and primary Th2 cells; Fig. 2 and data not shown). Nuclei were isolated and sonicated four times for 10 s each at the maximal setting with 1 min of cooling on ice in between. The average size of sonicated DNA was ∼0.5kb. The chromatin was immunoprecipitated using anti-NFAT1 (anti-67.1 and anti-NFAT1-C antibodies specific for the family member NFAT1-C) (24Wang D. McCaffrey P. Rao A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), anti-acetyl-histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-Pol II (sc-899; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or rabbit IgG (Sigma). Following the reversal of cross-links, the presence of selected DNA sequences was assessed by PCR. The primers used in ChIP were as follows: IL-10 promoter, 5′-GAGTGCTAAGGTGACTTCCGA-3′ and 5′-AACTTCTGCATTACAGCTATTTTT-3′ (280-bp product); IL-4 promoter, 5′-TGATAAGATTAGTCTGAAAGGCCGATT-3′ and 5′-GTTTATCAAGAGATGCTAACAATGCAATG-3′ (300-bp product); and IFN-γ promoter, 5′-CTGTGCTCTGTGGATGAGAAATTCACA-3′ and 5′-TTTAAGATGGTGACAGATAGGTGGG-3′ (257-bp product). As a loading control, the PCR was done directly on input DNA purified from chromatin before immunoprecipitation. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels. Bioinformatics—Alignments between the mouse and human IL-10 loci were performed, and the extent of DNA sequence homology was computed with a web-based program called VISTA (www.gsd.lbl.gov/vista) (12Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1046-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 13Dubchak I. Brudno M. Loots G.G. Pachter L. Mayor C. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6, the plot of the percentage of sequence identity is referred to the mouse sequence. Regions with a length of at least 100 bp, which show at least 75% sequence identity at each segment of the alignment between successive gaps, are identified as CNS regions and are shown in red in Fig. 6. The IL10 Cytokine Cluster—Fig. 1 shows the organization of the IL10/IL19/IL20/IL24 cytokine cluster on human chromosome 1q31–32, syntenic to mouse chromosome 1E4. The IL10 gene is located 35 kb from the MAPKAP2 gene in the human (25 kb in the mouse) and 62 kb from the IL19 gene (89 kb in the mouse). In this study we focus on a 22-kb region surrounding the IL10 gene contained within two BamH I fragments of 6 and 16 kb (Fig. 1). Differential DNase I Hypersensitivity of the IL10 Gene in Th1 and Th2 Cells—We compared the chromatin structure of the IL10 gene in Th1 and Th2 cells using two fully differentiated T cell clones, D5 and D10 (8Rao A. Faas S.J. Cantor H. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Kaye J. Porcelli S. Tite J. Jones B. Janeway C.A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 836-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). D5 cells, which belong to the Th1 subtype, have silenced the IL10 gene and show no expression of IL10 mRNA regardless of whether or not they are stimulated. In contrast, D10 cells, which belong to the Th2 subtype, basally express low levels of IL10 transcripts under resting conditions and rapidly induce IL10 mRNA and protein upon stimulation with either PMA and ionomycin or anti-CD3 (Ref. 5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar and data not shown). We used an exon 1 probe to examine the DNase I hypersensitivity pattern in the 5′-region of the IL10 gene in these two cell types (Fig. 2A). Consistent with their basal expression of the IL10 gene, resting D10 cells showed a strong HS site at the proximal IL10 promoter; this site was not apparent in resting D5 cells, which have silenced IL-10 gene expression (Fig. 2A). We next repeated the experiment using primary Th1 and Th2 cells, which do not express or express high levels of IL10 mRNA and protein respectively (Ref. 5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar and data not shown). Again, primary Th1 cells showed no evidence of DNase I hypersensitivity at the IL10 promoter, whereas Th2 cells showed an obvious HS site (Fig. 2B). We used probes spanning exon 3 and exon 5 to monitor DNase I hypersensitivity patterns in the 16-kb BamHI fragment containing the 3′-region of the IL10 gene (Fig. 3). Using the exon 3 probe and resting D5 T cells, we showed that these cells displayed a strong constitutive HS site (designated HS site III) located ∼5.5 kb from the intronic BamHI site (Fig. 3, A and E, black arrows). Stimulation resulted in the appearance of strong inducible bands of 1 and 2.5 kb, corresponding to cleavage at inducible HS sites I and II (Fig. 3, A and E, gray arrows). These bands were weakly induced by ionomycin stimulation alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–12), substantially more strongly induced upon stimulation with both PMA and ionomycin (lanes 13–18), and lost upon stimulation in the presence of CsA (lanes 19–23). In addition, we also observed weak inducible bands of ∼7 and ∼8 kb corresponding to HS sites IV and V (Fig. 3, A and E, gray arrows). A very similar pattern was observed when the same blot was rehybridized with the exon 5 probe (data not shown). A diagram interpreting these hypersensitivity patterns is shown in Fig. 3E. We repeated the DNase I hypersensitivity analysis using the D10 Th2 clone (Fig. 3B). Although resting D10 cells displayed the constitutive HS site located ∼5.5 kb from the intronic BamHI site (Fig. 3B), they showed a far more limited pattern of inducible HS sites. Specifically, these cells did not show the inducible bands of 1 and 2.5 kb corresponding to cleavage at inducible HS sites I and II, although they did display the inducible bands of ∼7 and ∼8 kb resulting from cleavage at HS sites IV and V (Fig. 3, B and E). We confirmed the observation that primary T cells displayed a similar pattern of HS sites (Fig. 3, C and D). Naïve precursor CD4 T cells showed no evidence of any HS sites on the IL10 gene, using either the exon 5 or the exon 1 probe (data not shown). However the patterns of DNase I hypersensitivity observed in primary differentiated Th1 and Th2 cells were similar to those observed in D5 and D10 clones, respectively. Specifically, primary Th1 cells exhibited the intronic HS sites, whereas primary Th2 cells did not (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, these data show that Th1 and Th2 cells differ in their patterns of DNase I hypersensitivity on the IL10 gene. Curiously, Th1 cells, which do not express the IL10 gene, show a more complex pattern of HS sites in the vicinity of the IL10 gene than do Th2 cells, which strongly express the gene. Silencing of the IL10 Promoter in the D5 Th1 Clone—The presence of a constitutive HS site at the IL10 promoter region in D10/Th2 but not D5/Th1 cells (Fig. 2), taken together with the ability of D10/Th2 but not D5/Th1 cells to transcribe IL10 (5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), suggested that the promoter was poised for active transcription in Th2 cells but silenced in committed Th1 cells. To test this hypothesis, we used the ChIP technique (Fig. 4A). For technical reasons, only D5 and D10 clones, which constitute homogeneous, committed, and strongly transcribing cell populations, could be used in this assay. The cells were stimulated and fixed with formaldehyde to cross-link DNA-protein complexes, and sheared DNAs were immunoprecipitated using antibodies to RNA polymerase II, acetylated histone H4, and the inducible transcription factor NFAT1. PCR was performed to detect association of the IL10 promoter with the respective immunoprecipitated fraction; IL4 and IFNγ promoter primers were used as controls. Like the IL4 promoter, the IL10 promoter was hyperacetylated on histone H4 in D10 Th2 cells even prior to stimulation (Fig. 4A, top two panels, rows labeled anti-acetylH4). Both promoters showed basal occupancy by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Fig. 4A, top two panels, rows labeled anti-Pol II), confirming their poised status. IL4 and IL10 promoters became accessible to NFAT1 after stimulation (Fig. 4A, top two panels, rows labeled anti-NFAT1), correlating with the rapid increase in IL-4 and IL-10 production by stimulated D10 cells. In contrast, D5 T cells, which do not produce either IL-4 or IL-10, showed no histone hyperacetylation, Pol II occupancy, or inducible NFAT1 binding at either of these two promoters (Fig. 4A, top two panels). However these cells showed constitutive hyperacetylation, constitutive Pol II occupancy, and inducible NFAT1 binding at the IFNγ promoter, consistent with their competence to produce IFN-γ upon stimulation (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). As a further test of differential promoter accessibility, we probed the methylation status of the IL10 promoter in D5 and D10 cells using the methylation-sensitive and -insensitive enzyme pair HpaII/MspI, which recognizes 5′-CCGG sites (Fig. 4B). BamHI digestion of D5 or D10 DNA yielded a 6-kb band that hybridized to the exon 1 probe (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3), whereas digestion with BamHI plus MspI yielded the expected 1.2- and 0.7-kb fragments hybridizing to the exon 1 probe (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 4; see diagram at bottom). After HpaII digestion of D5 DNA, the 6-kb fragment was partially converted to a slightly smaller fragment with no appearance of a 0.7-kb fragment (Fig. 4B, lane 3), indicating partial demethylation of the intronic HpaII site (c) but complete methylation of the HpaII sites in the IL10 promoter (a) and in exon 1 (b) (see diagram in Fig. 4B). In contrast, BamHI-digested D10 DNA was fully cleaved by HpaII, resulting in 1.2- and 0.7-kb fragments hybridizing to the IL10 exon 1 probe (Fig. 4B, lane 6) and showing full demethylation at all three HpaII sites. NFAT Binding to an Intronic Region of the IL10 Gene in the D5 Th1 Clone—Given the degree of promoter inactivation in D5 cells, it was surprising that inducible HS sites appeared in intronic regions of the IL10 gene in Th1 cells stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Figs. 3 and 4). We examined whether histones at HS sites I and II bore two modifications generally associated with active genes, i.e. acetylation of histone H4 and dimethylation of histone 3 and lysine 4 (10Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 11Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7632) Google Scholar). As expected from the silenced status of the IL10 gene in D5 cells, the levels of both histone modifications were considerably lower in D5 cells than in D10 cells (Fig. 5A, top two rows). Furthermore, the histone deacetylase HDAC1 was more strongly associated with HS sites I and II in D5 cells than in D10 cells (third row from top), which is again consistent with IL10 gene silencing in D5 cells. Because CsA blocked induction of all the inducible HS sites in D5 Th1 cells (Figs. 3 and 4), we asked whether NFAT proteins participated in their formation. We searched for conserved NFAT binding sites in the IL10 promoter and intronic regions using the program rVISTA (version 2.0; rvista.dcode.org/) (12Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1046-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 13Dubchak I. Brudno M. Loots G.G. Pachter L. Mayor C. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This analysis identified NFAT binding sites in the IL10 promoter, intron 3 and intron 4, which were strongly conserved between human and mouse (Fig. 5B and data not shown). ChIP assays showed that NFAT1 bound strongly and inducibly to the inducible HS site II, located in intron 4 of the IL10 gene, in D5 but not in D10 cells (Fig. 5A, fourth row from the top). In contrast, NFAT1 did not bind to HS site I located in intron 3, even though this intron contains a conserved NFAT binding site. The difference could reflect the different sequence contexts of the NFAT binding sites; the sites at the promoter and intron 4 do not contain an adjacent AP-1 binding site (Fig. 5B), and NFAT binding may therefore be stabilized by a partner protein already present in the nucleus under the stimulation conditions used, whereas the site in intron 3 is likely a composite NFAT:AP-1 site in the mouse (data not shown), which would be predicted not to support NFAT binding at early times after stimulation when AP-1 proteins are not yet induced (14Jain J. Miner Z. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 837-848PubMed Google Scholar). We have defined the patterns of DNase I hypersensitivity in the IL10 locus of naïve and differentiating T cells. DNase I hypersensitive sites mark nucleosome-poor regions that tend to be located in the vicinity of protein-bound regulatory elements; these regions have been shown in different systems to function as enhancers, locus control regions, matrix attachment regions, or insulator/boundary elements. DNase I hypersensitivity analysis is useful for at least two reasons, i.e. it provides a first indication of whether a gene is transcriptionally competent or silenced, and it constitutes a simple method for long-range mapping of potentially important regulatory regions of the gene. Bioinformatic analysis of the IL10 gene shows a remarkable correspondence between the positions of experimentally determined HS regions and the CNS regions identified by sequence comparisons of mammalian genomes (Fig. 6). This correspondence appears to be a common feature of cytokine genes, because it has also been noted in the IL4/IL13 and IFNγ loci (6Ansel K.M. Lee D.U. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 15Loots G.G. Locksley R.M. Blankespoor C.M. Wang Z.E. Miller W. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A.

All six HS sites identified in our analysis, HS sites I–V and the HS site at the IL10 promoter, map in the vicinity of CNS regions that are highly conserved between human and mouse (Fig. 6; note that HS sites are generally found at the boundaries of protein-bound regulatory elements and not within the occupied regions themselves) (18Hernandez-Munain C. Roberts J.L. Krangel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3223-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A longer-range view of the IL10 locus, shown in Fig. 6B, indicates the presence of several other CNS regions in the vicinity of the IL10 gene. Further analysis is needed to determine which of these regions is pertinent to regulation of the IL10 gene and which is pertinent to regulation of the flanking IL19 and MAPKAP2 genes. A comprehensive analysis of DNase I hypersensitivity, performed in a large number of different IL-10-producing cell types at all possible developmental stages and under all possible conditions of stimulation, will be necessary to reveal all of the conserved regions that participate in IL10 regulation in any given cell type under specified conditions of stimulation. The most striking hypersensitive site in the IL10 locus is constitutive HS site III, located immediately 3′ of the last exon of the IL10 gene. This site is not apparent in naïve CD4 T cells and develops in both Th1 and Th2 cells following T cell antigen receptor stimulation. The sequence of HS III is highly conserved (∼85%) in human, mouse, and rats (data not shown) and corresponds to a CNS region as shown in Fig. 6. The characteristic properties of this site (absence from naïve T cells and having constitutive rather than inducible hypersensitivity in differentiated T cells) suggest that it binds lineage-specific transcription factors rather than inducible transcription factors that mediate acute transcription of the IL10 gene. Like GATA3 and T-bet in Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively, such lineage-specific factor(s) responsible for IL10 gene expression may function to impose the remodeled chromatin structure of the IL10 locus and maintain it in a transcriptionally competent state (6Ansel K.M. Lee D.U. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Our studies focus attention on the IL10 promoter as a major region that determines IL10 expression in differentiated T cells. The promoter is the only identified region of the IL10 gene that assumes a fully inactive chromatin configuration in committed D5 Th1 cells as judged by hypoacetylation at histone H4, CpG methylation at two HpaII sites, and inaccessibility to binding of the inducible transcription factor NFAT1. The remainder of the IL10 locus remains accessible to binding of transcription factors as judged by the appearance of intronic and 3′ inducible hypersensitive sites and the direct demonstration of NFAT1 binding to HS site II by ChIP. This behavior is quite different from that documented previously for IL4, where Th1 cells that have shut off IL4 not only silence the IL4 promoter (Fig. 4) (4Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but show no HS sites other than those observed in naïve T cells (5Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and do not develop the inducible HS site at the 3′ IL4 enhancer following stimulation (19Agarwal S. Avni O. Rao A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The promoter-directed silencing of the IL10 gene also contrasts with the behavior of the IFNγ gene, which, when silenced in Th2 cells, shows no hypersensitivity whatsoever (19Agarwal S. Avni O. Rao A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is curious that the binding of NFAT1 to several cytokine promoters (IL10, IL4, and IFNγ) correlates with an open configuration of chromatin, characterized for instance by increased levels of histone H4 acetylation prior to stimulation (4Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas binding of the same transcription factor to intron 4 (HS site II) of the IL10 gene occurs despite a “silenced” chromatin configuration characterized by decreased histone H4 acetylation, decreased histone H3K4 dimethylation, and constitutive association with the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Inducible binding of NFAT1 to a site in exon 1 of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene was reported to repress CDK4 expression by recruiting HDAC1 (20Baksh S. Widlund H.R. Frazer-Abel A.A. Du J. Fosmire S. Fisher D.E. DeCaprio J.A. Modiano J.F. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). HDAC recruitment by NFAT may also contribute to silencing of a subset of the large number of genes, identified by DNA array analyses, whose expression is decreased by calcium/calcineurin signaling (21Feske S. Giltnane J. Dolmetsch R. Staudt L.M. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). However, in the IL10 gene HDAC1 is constitutively associated with both IL10 introns in D5 cells, whereas NFAT1 binds inducibly only to intron 4, suggesting that HDAC1 is recruited not by NFAT but rather by repressive factor(s) pre-bound to the intronic HS sites. The identity of these repressive factors awaits further analysis. To summarize, our data emphasize the surprising diversity of mechanisms used to regulate gene expression at the chromatin level. We have defined for the first time the DNase I hypersensitivity patterns of the IL10 gene in naïve and differentiated T cells. This analysis has revealed that the majority of DNase I hypersensitive sites correspond to conserved non-coding genomic regions that were identified by sequence comparisons of mammalian genomes. Furthermore, the analysis shows that different cell types expressing the same gene choose different subsets of the conserved CNS regions as DNase I hypersensitive sites, implying that the evolutionary conservation of these regions derives not from their simultaneous participation in gene expression in all expressing cell types but rather from their specialized roles as protein binding regulatory elements in individual cell types. We have also described a novel silencing mechanism directed selectively to the promoter of the IL10 gene, which is not observed in other cytokine genes such as IL4 and IFNγ. Because this mechanism appears to maintain IL10 intronic regions in a state of reversible HDAC-mediated silencing even in fully committed T cell clones, it may represent an evolutionary adaptation that permits reactivation of the IL10 gene under appropriate physiological or pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2148337375,"We have recently reported that two typical Gs-coupled receptors, the β2-adrenergic receptor and the receptor for prostaglandin E1, stimulate phospholipase C-ϵ (PLC-ϵ) and increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in HEK-293 cells and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, respectively, by a pathway involving Epac1, a cAMP-activated and Rap-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and the GTPase Rap2B. Here we have demonstrated that these Gs-coupled receptors use this pathway to activate H-Ras and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Specifically, agonist activation of the receptors resulted in activation of H-Ras and ERK1/2. The latter action was suppressed by dominant negative H-Ras, but not Rap1A. The receptor actions were independent of protein kinase A but fully mimicked by an Epac-specific cAMP analog as well as by a constitutively active Rap2B mutant. On the other hand, a cAMP-binding-deficient Epac1 mutant, the Rap GTPase-activating proteinII, and a dominant negative Rap2B mutant suppressed receptor- and Epac-mediated activation of H-Ras and ERK1/2. Finally, we have demonstrated that activation of H-Ras and ERK1/2 requires the lipase activity of PLC-ϵ and the subsequent [Ca2+]i increase, suggesting that H-Ras activation is mediated by a Ca2+-activated GEF. In line with this hypothesis, receptor-mediated activation of H-Ras and ERK1/2 was strongly enhanced by expression of RasGRP1, a Ca2+-regulated Ras-GEF. Collectively, our data indicated that Gs-coupled receptors can activate H-Ras and subsequently the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 by a Ca2+-activated Ras-GEF, possibly RasGRP1, mediated by cAMP-activated Epac proteins, which then lead via Rap2B and PLC-ϵ stimulation to [Ca2+]i increase. We have recently reported that two typical Gs-coupled receptors, the β2-adrenergic receptor and the receptor for prostaglandin E1, stimulate phospholipase C-ϵ (PLC-ϵ) and increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in HEK-293 cells and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, respectively, by a pathway involving Epac1, a cAMP-activated and Rap-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and the GTPase Rap2B. Here we have demonstrated that these Gs-coupled receptors use this pathway to activate H-Ras and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Specifically, agonist activation of the receptors resulted in activation of H-Ras and ERK1/2. The latter action was suppressed by dominant negative H-Ras, but not Rap1A. The receptor actions were independent of protein kinase A but fully mimicked by an Epac-specific cAMP analog as well as by a constitutively active Rap2B mutant. On the other hand, a cAMP-binding-deficient Epac1 mutant, the Rap GTPase-activating proteinII, and a dominant negative Rap2B mutant suppressed receptor- and Epac-mediated activation of H-Ras and ERK1/2. Finally, we have demonstrated that activation of H-Ras and ERK1/2 requires the lipase activity of PLC-ϵ and the subsequent [Ca2+]i increase, suggesting that H-Ras activation is mediated by a Ca2+-activated GEF. In line with this hypothesis, receptor-mediated activation of H-Ras and ERK1/2 was strongly enhanced by expression of RasGRP1, a Ca2+-regulated Ras-GEF. Collectively, our data indicated that Gs-coupled receptors can activate H-Ras and subsequently the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 by a Ca2+-activated Ras-GEF, possibly RasGRP1, mediated by cAMP-activated Epac proteins, which then lead via Rap2B and PLC-ϵ stimulation to [Ca2+]i increase. Activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; PTX, pertussis toxin; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PLC, phospholipase C; PGE1, prostaglandin E1; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; 8-pCPT-2Me-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyl cyclic AMP; P-ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2; β-ARK-CT, carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase; RapGAPII, Rap GTPase-activating proteinII; DAG, diacylglycerol. kinases plays a prominent role in many cellular responses to a large variety of membrane receptors. Initially identified as signal transducers of growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, activation of MAP kinases, specifically of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), is now also recognized as a major signal transduction pathway of many receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins. ERK activation by these second messenger-generating receptors is apparently accomplished by diverse molecular mechanisms, depending on the cell types studied as well as the receptor and the heterotrimeric G protein involved (1Pearson G.

The cAMP-producing Gs-coupled receptors play a rather unique role in ERK activation. These receptors inhibit ERK activation by growth factor receptors in several cell types while stimulating this cellular response in others, most notably in neuronal and endocrine cells. Several models have been proposed to explain these diverse actions of cAMP and Gs-coupled receptors on ERK activation, both apparently involving in most cases the principal cAMP target, the cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) (6Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 7Stork P.J.S. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In particular, PKA-dependent ERK activation in HEK-293 cells by the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), a prototypical Gs-coupled receptor, has been extensively studied. Lefkowitz and coworkers (8Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) reported that cAMP-activated PKA phosphorylates the β2-AR and thereby alters the coupling specificity of the receptor from Gs to Gi proteins. By this G protein “switching,” the β2-AR then apparently induces ERK activation by releasing Gβγ dimers from the pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi proteins, followed by activation of the cytosolic tyrosine kinase c-Src, the GTPase Ras, and the MAP kinase kinase kinase, Raf-1. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the switching of β2-AR from Gs to Gi proteins is controlled by β-arrestin, which recruits the cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase 4 to the plasma membrane and thereby alters the activity state of PKA (9Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In contrast, Schmitt and Stork (10Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) report that ERK activation by the β2-AR in HEK-293 cells, although also PKA- and c-Src-dependent, is PTX-insensitive and thus apparently does not require β2-AR switching to Gi proteins, a finding recently confirmed by others using a PKA-insensitive β2-AR mutant (11Friedmann J. Babu B. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Schmitt and Stork (10Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) show that ERK activation by β2-AR is not mediated by Ras but by the related GTPase Rap1, activating the MAP kinase kinase kinase B-Raf, but not Raf-1. Interestingly, activation of the β2-AR also resulted in Ras activation, but this receptor action was apparently independent of cAMP and PKA (10Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recently, these authors reported that activation of Rap1 by the β2-AR is apparently mediated by direct phosphorylation of c-Src on serine 17 by PKA, whereas activation of Ras by the β2-AR involves Gβγ dimers and c-Src and finally leads to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of AKT (12Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43024-43032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Activation of Rap1 by PKA-phosphorylated c-Src obviously also accounts for the inhibition of Ras/Raf-1/ERK signaling by Rap1 by sequestering Raf-1 to specific membrane domains and thereby preventing Raf-1 activation by Ras (13Schmitt J.M.

Few reports indicate that cAMP-dependent ERK activation by Gs-coupled receptors can also occur independently of PKA, such as the thyrotropin-induced ERK activation in FRTL5 cells (15Iacovelli L. Capobianco L. Salvatore L. Sallese M. D'Ancona G.M. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 924-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the parathyroid hormone-induced ERK activation in bone cells (16Fujita T. Meguro T. Fukuyama R. Nakamuta H. Koida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22191-22200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Both receptor actions apparently involve Rap1 and B-Raf (15Iacovelli L. Capobianco L.

Similar data were recently reported for calcitonin-induced ERK activation in native rat kidney cells (17Larouche-Joubert N. Marsy S. Michelet S. Imbert-Teboul M. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18598-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Using a specific antibody, evidence was provided that the PKA-independent action of calcitonin involves Epac1 (17Larouche-Joubert N. Marsy S. Michelet S. Imbert-Teboul M. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18598-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a Rap-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) directly activated by cAMP, independent of PKA (18de Rooij J.

Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Very recently, an involvement of Epac in ERK activation by 5-HT7 receptors in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells and by the parathyroid hormone-related protein in osteoblasts has been reported as well (21Lin S.L. Johnson-Farley N.N. Lubinsky D.R. Cowen D.S. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Chen C. Koh A.J. Datta N.S. Zhang J. Keller E.T. Xiao G. Franceschi R.T. D′Silva N.J. McCauley L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29121-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in human melanocytes and B16 mouse melanoma cells, PKA-independent ERK activation by cAMP-elevating agents was shown to be mediated by Ras, but not Rap1 (23Buscà R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychène A. Ortonne J.-P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, Rap1 and Ras are obviously key regulators of ERK activation by Gs-coupled receptors. Activation of these small GTPases, i.e. GTP loading, is catalyzed by several distinct GEFs, comprising about 20 distinct proteins (24Zwartkruis F.J.T. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Erhardt A. Erhardt G.R.A. Guo X. Schrader J.W. Exp.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these GEFs exhibit Rap specificity, as the above mentioned Epacs and the PDZ-GEFs, whereas others are Ras-specific, such as the SOS and GRF family members. In addition, some of these GEFs, e.g. members of the RasGRP/CalDAG-GEFs, have been reported to activate both Rap and Ras GTPases (24Zwartkruis F.J.T. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Erhardt A. Erhardt G.R.A. Guo X. Schrader J.W. Exp.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter group of GEFs also includes the recently identified phospholipase C-ϵ (PLC-ϵ), which via its CDC25 domain can activate Rap1A and Ras and induce Ras-dependent ERK activation (27Song C.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this PLC isoform can also be activated by Ras and Rap GTPases, apparently by binding to a separate domain, the RA2 domain (27Song C. Hu C.-D. Masago M. Kariya K.-i. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y.

We have recently shown that activation of two typical Gs-coupled receptors, the β2-AR transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells and a receptor for prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) endogenously expressed in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, leads to stimulation of PLC-ϵ and increases [Ca2+]i in a cAMP-dependent manner (31Schmidt M. Evellin S. Oude Weernink P.A. vom Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These Gs-coupled receptor actions were independent of PKA but mediated by cAMP-activated Epac1 and subsequent activation of the GTPase, Rap2B (31Schmidt M. Evellin S. Oude Weernink P.A. vom Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to analyze whether these Gs-coupled receptors use this pathway, particularly Epac1 and PLC-ϵ, for ERK activation. We report here that ERK activation by the β2-AR and the PGE1 receptor in HEK-293 cells and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, respectively, is mediated by cAMP-activated Epac proteins, which then lead via Rap2B and PLC-ϵ stimulation to [Ca2+]i increase, finally resulting in activation of H-Ras as a trigger of the MAP kinase cascade.

HEK-293 cells and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells grown to near confluence on 145-mm culture dishes were transfected with an efficiency of at least 50% as reported before (31Schmidt M. Evellin S.

Expression of the encoded proteins was verified by immunoblotting of cell lysates with specific antibodies. Assays were performed 48 h after transfection. For PTX treatment, the cells were incubated for 16 h with 100 ng/ml PTX. Construction of R279K Epac1 and ΔCDC25 PLC-ϵ—The Epac1 mutant, R279K Epac1, with a point mutation in the cAMP-binding pocket (19Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) was generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR was carried out with 50 ng of the plasmid carrying the Epac1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF103905) and complementary primers containing the desired mutation (mismatching nucleotides are in bold; forward: 5′-ggtgaatgatgcacccaaggcagccaccatcatcc-3′; reverse: 5′-ggatgatggtggctgccttgggtgcatcattcacc-3′). Subsequently, the methylated parental DNA was digested with DpnI endonuclease, and the nicked vector with the desired mutation was transformed into Escherichia coli. The PLC-ϵ deletion mutant ΔCDC25 PLC-ϵ was constructed by replacing the KpnI/StuI fragment of wild-type PLC-ϵ cDNA by a corresponding PCR product of this region lacking the complete sequence of the CDC25 domain (amino acids 220–523). PCR was performed with a primer pair flanking the 5′-terminus of cDNA encoding PLC-ϵ inclusive of the KpnI/StuI fragment (forward, 5′-taatacgactcactataggg-3′; reverse, 5′-ttctcgaggccttctgtgagtcctctgaaggctgcagatcgatcagctccttg-3′) and PLC-ϵ subcloned in pcDNA3 as template using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). Thereafter, the PCR fragment was ligated into the vector pGEM-T Easy by TA cloning (Promega). As PLC-ϵ contains a second StuI restriction site beyond the open reading frame, the NdeI/XbaI fragment of PLC-ϵ was subcloned into pET-23a (Novagen) to receive the pET-23a-PLC-ϵ plasmid. This construct was digested with KpnI/StuI and ligated with the appropriately cut PCR product, resulting in the full-length cDNA of ΔCDC25 PLC-ϵ. Finally, the NdeI/XbaI fragment of pET-23a-ΔCDC25 PLC-ϵ was cloned into pcDNA3 to obtain ΔCDC25 PLC-ϵ. The correct sequences were verified by sequencing. ERK Activation Assay—For measurement of ERK activation, HEK-293 cells and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were serum starved for 16 h and then incubated for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C with the indicated agents, followed by cell lysis in a buffer containing 1% SDS and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 and five passages through a 25-gauge needle (32Voss M.

Thereafter, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation, followed by determination of protein concentration and incubation in Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 95 °C. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 were detected with the anti-P-ERK1/2 antibody. Densitometric analysis of the bands (P-ERK1 plus P-ERK2) was performed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Activation of H-Ras and Rap2B—Serum-starved HEK-293 cells and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells transfected with wild-type H-Ras or Rap2B were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with the indicated agents. After cell lysis, activated H-Ras and Rap2B were extracted with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Raf1-RBD (Ras-binding domain of Raf-1) and GST-tagged RalGDS-RBD (Rap-binding domain of the Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator), respectively, each bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and immunoblotting with anti-H-Ras or anti-Rap2 antibodies as described before (31Schmidt M.

Immunoblot Analysis—For detection of P-ERK1/2, Epac1, Epac2 (dilution of 1:1000), c-Myc (dilution of 1:200), HA, ERK1/2, Rap2B, and H-Ras (each at a dilution of 1:500), equal (or indicated) amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and a 1-h incubation with the antibodies at the dilution factors given above, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Data Presentation—Data shown in the figures are mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Comparisons between means were either with the Student's paired t test or one-way analysis of variance test. A difference was regarded as significant at p < 0.05. Characterization of ERK Activation by the β2-AR in HEK-293 Cells—We have recently reported that the β2-AR transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells mediates PLC-ϵ stimulation and [Ca2+]i increase by a pathway involving the cAMP-regulated Rap-GEF Epac1 and the GTPase Rap2B (31Schmidt M.

Here we studied whether this signaling pathway contributes to activation of MAP kinases, specifically ERK1 and ERK2, by the β2-AR. As reported before (31Schmidt M. Evellin S. Oude Weernink P.A. vom Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the HEK-293 cells used for the present study do not endogenously express β2-ARs; accordingly, treatment of untransfected cells with the β2-AR agonist, adrenaline, did not induce MAP kinase activation (data not shown). However, upon expression of the β2-AR, agonist activation of the receptor induced a strong, but transient, phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. The stimulatory effect of adrenaline reached its maximum at 2–5 min and rather rapidly disappeared thereafter (Fig. 1A). Half-maximal and maximal activation was observed at about 1 and 10 μm adrenaline, respectively (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by adrenaline (10 μm) was fully blocked by the β2-AR antagonist propranolol (1 μm) (see Fig. 3B), as well as by the MAP kinase kinase inhibitors PD98059 (10 μm) and U0126 (10 μm) (data not shown).Fig. 3Role of c-Src, Gi proteins, Gβγ, Rap1A, and H-Ras for ERK activation by the β -AR. HEK-293 cells transfected with the β2-AR alone (Ctr) or together with K298M c-Src (A), β2-ARK-CT (B), S17N Rap1A or S17N H-Ras (C) were incubated for 5 min without (–) and with (+) 10 μm adrenaline in the absence and presence of 1 μm propranolol (B, Prop). Where indicated, cells were treated for 15 min and 16 h before agonist stimulation with 10 μm PP2 (A) and 100 ng/ml PTX (B), respectively.

Similar to these studies, we observed that ERK activation by the β2-AR was mimicked by direct activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin, although its action was less rapid and more sustained than that of the receptor agonist, adrenaline (Fig. 2A). Maximal ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by forskolin (30 μm) was observed at 15–30 min and slowly declined thereafter. Furthermore, the direct adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (10 μm) suppressed the stimulatory effects of both adrenaline (n = 4; p <0.001) and forskolin (not shown) on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2B). However, treatment of the cells with the PKA inhibitor H-89 (10 μm) did not alter ERK activation induced by the β2-AR or forskolin (not shown) at any time point measured (Fig. 2B), indicating that the β2-AR-induced ERK activation is cAMP-dependent, but independent of PKA. To test for a possible involvement of c-Src, the cells were treated with the c-Src inhibitor PP2 (10 μm) or transfected with the kinase-deficient c-Src mutant K298M c-Src, which both interfered with epidermal growth factor signaling in these cells (35Stope M.B. vom Dorp F. Szatkowski D. Böhm A. Keiper M. Nolte J. Oude Weernink P.A. Rosskopf D. Evellin S. Jakobs K.H. Schmidt M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4664-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Neither of these treatments suppressed adrenaline-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), although it was noted that PP2 reduced both basal and adrenaline-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by some 30% (n = 4; p < 0.03). Treatment of the HEK-293 cells with PTX (16 h, 100 ng/ml), to interfere with potential coupling of the β2-AR to Gi proteins, did not alter phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by adrenaline either (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, scavenging of Gβγ dimers by expression of β-ARK-CT (36Koch W.J. Hawes B. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not affect ERK activation by the β2-AR (Fig. 3B). These treatments fully (PTX) or at least partially (β-ARK-CT) blocked ERK activation by Gi-coupled sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors endogenously expressed in these cells (data not shown). Finally, we asked which type of small GTPase acts as final effector of the β2-AR signaling cascade leading to activation of the MAP kinases. As illustrated in Fig. 3C, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by adrenaline was strongly reduced by expression of dominant negative S17N H-Ras (n = 5; p < 0.008), but not altered by expression of S17N Rap1A. Similar data were obtained when the effects of S17N H-Ras and S17N Rap1A were examined on ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by forskolin (data not shown). Thus, ERK activation by the β2-AR expressed in HEK-293 cells apparently required cAMP and H-Ras, but not PKA, Gi proteins, c-Src, and Rap1A. Involvement of Epac and Rap2B in H-Ras and ERK Activation by the β2-AR—Besides PKA enzymes, Epac proteins, which act as specific GEFs for Rap GTPases, are directly activated by cAMP (18de Rooij J.

The diversity is created during biosynthesis by sulfotransferases, which add sulfate groups to the growing chain, and a C5-epimerase, which converts selected glucuronic acid residues to iduronic acid. All these modifications are believed to depend on initial glucosamine N-sulfation carried out by the enzyme glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST). Here we report that heparan sulfate synthesized by mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in NDST1 and NDST2 completely lacks N-sulfation but still contains 6-O-sulfate groups, demonstrating that 6-O-sulfation can occur without prior N-sulfation. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis indicates that all three identified 6-O-sulfotransferases are expressed by the cells, 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 being the dominating form. The 6-O-sulfated polysaccharide lacking N-sulfate groups also contains N-unsubstituted glucosamine units, raising questions about how these units are generated.

Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). On the other hand, most tissues are formed in apparently normal fashion in mice with dramatically altered HS structure such as in mice lacking 2-O-sulfotransferase, C5-epimerase, or N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 (NDST1; Refs. 2Bullock S.L.

However, when the HS-polymerase EXT1 is knocked out, apparently leading to a complete lack of HS, the embryos die at gastrulation (5Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Early embryonic lethality is also seen in embryos devoid of both NDST1 and NDST2 (6Forsberg E. Kjellen L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In HS biosynthesis, NDST activity appears to be a key regulator, since all types of modifications, 2-O-, 6-O-, and 3-O-sulfation and C5 epimerization, are found in N-sulfated regions (7Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the actual organization of the HS biosynthesis machinery, and an increasing amount of evidence suggests that NDST activity is influenced by what has been thought to be subsequent modifications (4Li J.P.

Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4552-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). While the presence of N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues in native HS has been documented (10van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A. Kjellen L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H.

It has been speculated that they may arise from incomplete action of NDSTs (12Westling C. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49247-49255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this paper we have studied HS biosynthesis in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient in NDST1 and NDST2. These cells synthesize 6-O-sulfated HS, devoid of N-sulfate groups, containing some N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues. We conclude that 6-O-sulfation as well as the generation of N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues may occur independently of N-sulfation. Establishment of ES Cell Lines—Murine blastocysts of different genotypes (NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– (A1, A3, B5), NDST1+/–/NDST2–/–, control (C57, 129)) were isolated and plated on primary mouse embryonic fibroblast in embryonic stem cell medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax-1, sodium pyruvate, 4500 mg/liter glucose, and pyridoxine (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Invitrogen) supplemented with 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 10–4m β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (mouse recombinant, Chemicon). After 5–6 days in culture the inner cell mass was isolated and dispersed after exposure to 1× trypsin/EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). The dispersed cells were then plated in a fresh well coated with mouse embryonic fibroblast. ES cell-like colonies appeared after 2–8 days of culture and were isolated and dispersed as described above until a stable ES cell line was established. The cells were genotyped by PCR using the following primers: forward NDST-1, 5′-GGCTGGTTCGGTGTCTTTTG-3′ and reverse wild type 5′-CGGTTCCAGGCATCCAGGTT-3′; NDST-2, forward 5′-CCTGGCTGTTTGGTCTCTGT-3′ and reverse wild type 5′-CGCTTTCAATACAGGAGAGG-3′; reverse NDST-1/NDST-2 knockout primer (located in the neomycin cassette), 5′-CTGCTCTTTACTGAAGGCTC-3′. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from ES cells with the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen) and converted to cDNA using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For PCR analysis of NDST expression, the AmpliTaq Gold PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) was used. PCR reactions were performed by denaturing the DNA at 95 °C for 8 min before amplification for 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of 95 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 60 s, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The cDNA was amplified using the following primers: NDST-1 (1007 bp), forward 5′-GGTTGGAACCGGGGCCTT-3′ and reverse 5′-ATCATCATCGTCGCCAGCATCCTCAGC-3′; NDST2 (1004 bp), forward 5′-ACCAGCCCCAAGGCCAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GTCGTCGTCGTCCCCAGCATCCTCCTC-3′; NDST3 (992 bp), forward 5′-GGCTACAAACAGGAAAGTGAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-ATCATCATCATCCCCTTCATCTTCCTC-3′; NDST4 (989 bp), forward 5′-GGCTACAAACAGGAAATGACAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTCGTCGTCGTCACCTTCATCCTCTTC-3′. For PCR analysis of 6-O-sulfotransferase expression, the TaKaRa La TaqPCR kit (Göteborgs Termometerfabrik) was used. PCR reactions were performed by denaturing the DNA at 95 °C for 8 min before amplification for 35 cycles, each cycle consisting of 95 °C, 20 s; 55 °C, 40 s; 72 °C, 2 min, with a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The cDNA was amplified using the following primers: 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (1193 bp), forward 5′-CGTGCTTCATGCTCATCCT-3′ and reverse 5′-AATCGTGCCCATCACTCTCT-3′; 6-O-sulfotransferase 2 (1449 bp), forward 5′-CTGCTGCTGGCTTTGGTGAT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCGCTATCACCTTGTCCCT-3′; 6-O-sulfotransferase 3 (587 bp), forward 5′-TGAATGAGAGCGAGCGGAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TGGATTGGAAATGAAGGCAGAG-3′. cDNA from mouse embryos (E11.5; Clontech) was used as a positive control. The amount of cDNA in each sample was controlled by PCR of mouse hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (hprt, 349 bp), using the primers 5′-CTCGAAGTGTTGGATACAGG-3′ and 5′-TGGCCTATAGGCTCATAGTG-3′. Structural Analysis of HS by Reverse Phase Ion Pair (RPIP)-HPLC—HS from ES cells (10 × 106) was isolated and degraded to disaccharides by enzymatic cleavage and detected in a HPLC-based system as described (13Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (July 29, 10.1074/jbc.M405382200)Google Scholar). In short, glycosaminoglycans were isolated and purified from ES cells by proteolytic cleavage and nuclease treatment followed by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. The purified glycosaminoglycans were cleaved with chondroitinase ABC, and 10% of the samples was saved for analysis. HS was purified from the chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronan disaccharides by an additional DEAE purification step followed by cleavage with heparitinase I–III. The generated HS disaccharides were subjected to RPIP-HPLC analysis followed by post-column derivatization with cyanoacetamide and detection in a fluorescence detector, essentially as described (14Staatz W.D. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Chhor K. Selleck S.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 41-52PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison with HS and CS disaccharide standards both the identity and the amount of the disaccharides were established. Metabolic Labeling of Glycosaminoglycans—ES cells were metabolically labeled for 16 h with 50 μCi of [3H]glucosamine in 6 ml of embryonic stem cell medium. After 16 h of incubation the medium was recovered, and the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation for 30 min in 2 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.10 m NaCl), containing the protease inhibitors EDTA (2 mm), N-ethylmaleimide (2 mm), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and pepstatin A (10 μg/ml). After centrifugation at 800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (solubilized cell lysate) containing radiolabeled macromolecules was recovered. Glycosaminoglycan Isolation—Glycosaminoglycans were isolated from the solubilized cell lysate on a 0.3-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.10 m NaCl, and 0.10 of the concentration of the protease inhibitors added to the solubilization buffer (see above). The column was first washed with equilibration buffer and subsequently with 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.10 m NaCl. The glycosaminoglycans were eluted with 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 m NaCl. HS Structural Analysis—Radiolabeled glycosaminoglycans were alkali-treated as described previously (15Bengtsson J. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After desalting in water on PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) followed by lyophilization, the 3H-labeled glycosaminoglycans were subjected to digestion with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) as described previously (16Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindhal U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The resulting 3H-labeled HS chains were desalted using YM3 filters (Amicon Bioseparations). One-quarter of the sample was saved for nitrous acid treatment, while the remaining part was acetylated. After addition of methanol to a final concentration of 10%, repeated additions of acetic acid anhydride were made during 1 h. The pH was kept at 7–7.8 by addition of saturated Na2CO3 in 10% methanol. The 3H-labeled glycosaminoglycans were recovered by ethanol precipitation and centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in water and subjected to nitrous acid treatment at pH 1.5 and 3.9 (17Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The resulting 3H-labeled oligosaccharides were separated by gel chromatography on a Superose 6 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences), eluted in 0.5 m NH4HCO3. Total Disaccharide Composition—Radiolabeled glycosaminoglycans were desalted using YM3 filters and subjected to chondroitinase ABC and alkali treatment as described above. Isolated 3H-labeled HS was chemically N-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis for 5 h, followed by combined deamination at pH 1.5 and 3.9 (18Riesenfeld J. Hook M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 421-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reduction with NaBH4. The resultant disaccharides, containing terminal anhydromannitol (aManR) residues, were recovered by gel filtration on a column (1 × 180 cm) of Sephadex G-15 (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The disaccharides were characterized by anion-exchange chromatography on a Partisil-10 SAX column (Whatman Inc.) eluted with a stepwise gradient of KH2PO4 (19Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). NDST-1 and NDST-2 Are the Main NDST Isoforms in Embryonic Stem Cells—In ES cells derived from C57 and 129 blastocysts, NDST1 and NDST2 are the only NDST isoforms expressed in significant amounts, as judged by RT-PCR (Fig. 1). Low levels of a PCR product corresponding to NDST3 were obtained after 35 cycles of amplification using mRNA from 129 control ES cells as template (Fig. 1). Extending the number of cycles to 40, small amounts of NDST3 transcript were detected also in the other ES cell lines (data not shown). The identity of the PCR product as NDST3 was confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). No NDST4 was detected in any of the ES cells even after 40 cycles of PCR amplification. 6-O-Sulfation without N-Sulfation—To characterize the HS produced by ES cells devoid of NDST1 and NDST2, glycosaminoglycans were isolated from these cells and from control cells. After chondroitinase ABC digestion, an aliquot was saved for analysis of CS structure with RPIP-HPLC. HS was isolated from the digest on a DEAE spin column and subjected to heparitinase (I, II, and III) digestion. The generated disaccharides were then analyzed by RPIP-HPLC. ES cells derived from C57 and 129 control blastocysts, containing both NDST1 and NDST2, synthesize a polysaccharide resembling “an average” low sulfated mouse tissue HS (Fig. 2, Table I), indicating that HS biosynthesis in ES cells shares general properties of HS biosynthesis with more differentiated cells. The amount of HS synthesized in the different cultures was roughly the same for cells of all genotypes. Also the HS/CS ratios were similar in the different cell lines (data not shown). In HS from ES cells lacking NDST2, but heterozygous for the NDST1 mutation, total N-sulfation was reduced compared with the control with effects resembling those of NDST1 deficiency in liver, 2J. Ledin, M. Ringvall, I. Eriksson, M. Wilén, M. Thuveson, M. Kusche-Gullberg, and L. Kjellén, unpublished data. with 2-O-sulfation more severely affected than 6-O-sulfation. The lowered HS sulfation in these cells compared with that in C57 and 129 ES cells could reflect a dose dependence for NDST1 transcript. Alternatively, NDST2 has a role in HS biosynthesis in ES cells. In ES cells deficient in NDST1 and NDST2, no disaccharides containing N-sulfate groups were present (Fig. 2, Table I). Interestingly, about half of the 6-O-sulfate groups remained compared with HS from control ES cells. In the RPIP-HPLC protocol, the structure of disaccharides obtained after enzymatic cleavage is based on retention time compared with known standards (14Staatz W.D. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Chhor K. Selleck S.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 41-52PubMed Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that an unrelated structure could be eluted as the same position as standard 6-O-sulfated disaccharides, another method for structural analysis was performed. 3H-Labeled HS from control (C57) and NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– (B5) cells were subjected to extensive deaminative cleavage (17Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) followed by reduction with NaBH4. The obtained reduced products were then separated on an anion-exchange SAX column as described (19Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The 3H-labeled HS disaccharides obtained from NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– (B5) cells were of two kinds, non-sulfated or GlcA/GlcNAc6S, confirming the results obtained with RPIP-HPLC method. The two methods generated quantitatively similar results, and also the structure of HS synthesized by the control cells could be confirmed (data not shown).Table IDisaccharide composition of HS from different ES cell clonesDisaccharide speciesNDST1+/-/NDST2-/-A1 NDST1-/-/NDST2-/-B5 NDST1-/-/NDST2-/-A3 NDST1-/-/NDST2-/-Control 129Control C57NAc68.191.894.588.961.462.7NS9.800016.015.96S13.58.25.511.110.810.32S000000NS6S5.50004.13.9NS2S1.50005.95.4NS6S2S1.60001.71.8 Open table in a new tab To study whether any of the three known HS 6-O-sulfotransferases were expressed by the ES cells, an RT-PCR experiment was performed. As shown in Fig. 1, 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 is expressed in both control and NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells. Low levels of 6-O-sulfotransferase 2 and 6-O-sulfotransferase 3 could also be detected (data not shown). The identity of the weak bands as 6-O-sulfotransferase 2 and 6-O-sulfotransferase 3, respectively, was confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). Nitrous Acid Deamination Confirms the Lack of N-Sulfation and Reveals the Presence of N-Unsubstitued Glucosamine Residues—To confirm the absence of N-sulfate groups in HS from NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells and to look for the presence of N-unsubstitued glucosamine residues, metabolically [3H]glucosamine-labeled HS was purified from control C57 and NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells and subjected to nitrous acid cleavage followed by gel chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Fig. 3). Nitrous acid at pH 1.5 is known to cleave HS at N-sulfated residues, while deamination at pH 3.9 results in cleavage of the chain at N-unsubstituted glucosamine units (17Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In a preliminary experiment with 3H-labeled HS from NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells, we noted a similar reduction in apparent molecular size after treatment at pH 1.5 and pH 3.9, respectively, or after a combined pH 1.5/pH 3.9 treatment (data not shown). It is known that excess amounts of low pH nitrous acid reagent will efficiently cleave HS also at positions of free amino groups (20Riesenfeld J. Roden L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the 3H-labeled HS was therefore chemically acetylated before treatment with nitrous acid at pH 1.5. The acetylation did not result in any change in elution position on Superose 6 (data not shown). While acetylated 3H-labeled HS from control C57 cells was sensitive to treatment with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (Fig. 3A), no degradation of acetylated 3H-labeled HS from B5 NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells could be detected (Fig 3B), confirming the lack of N-sulfate groups in HS from these cells. Acetylated 3H-labeled HS from both cell types were resistant to treatment with nitrous acid at pH 3.9 (Fig. 3, C and D), as could be expected. In contrast, the unacetylated 3H-labeled HS preparations were both sensitive to this treatment (Fig. 3, E and F), demonstrating the presence of N-unsubstitued glucosamine residues in control as well as in NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells. It may also be noted in Fig. 3 that the 3H-labeled HS polysaccharide chains from NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells are longer (KAV 0.58) than the control polysaccharides (KAV 0.65). We have shown that ES cells deficient in NDST1 and NDST2 synthesize 6-O-sulfated HS lacking N-sulfate groups. This was an unexpected finding, since 6-O-sulfate groups have always been found in close vicinity to N-sulfate groups (21Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), and, defects in Drosophila sulfateless, a gene encoding an NDST homolog, result in the biosynthesis of a completely non-sulfated HS polysaccharide (22Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Fox B. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21856-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro experiments with recombinant 6-O-sulfotransferases have shown that N-sulfated disaccharides are preferred substrates for these enzymes (23Smeds E. Habuchi H. Do A.T. Hjertson E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our results may suggest a more independent role for 6-O-sulfotransferases in HS biosynthesis. It is also noteworthy that almost nothing is known about the substrate specificity of the NDST enzymes and what factors that may influence the length of the N-sulfated regions. If some 6-O-sulfation is initiated before or at the same time as N-sulfation, it is possible that the positions of the 6-O-sulfate groups may influence the N-sulfation pattern. Further studies with recombinant NDST enzymes are required to investigate if and how 6-O-sulfation regulates NDST substrate recognition. In addition, we show that the generation of free amino groups appears to be independent of NDST1 and NDST2, as similar amounts of N-unsubstitued glucosamine residues are found in HS from both control and NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells (Fig. 3). With sensitive PCR conditions, we could detect small amounts of NDST3 mRNA. It has been demonstrated previously that NDST3 has a high N-deacetylating capacity, while the N-sulfotransferase activity is the lowest among the four NDSTs (25Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). NDST3 is therefore a tentative generator of free amino groups. However, we know from previous studies of NDST1 mutants overexpressed in 293 cells that free amino groups generated by an NDST1 mutant lacking N-sulfotransferase activity are efficiently sulfated by N-sulfotransferase-expressing NDSTs in the same cell (15Bengtsson J. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2110-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, since both control cells and NDST1–/–/NDST2–/– cells contain N-unsubstitued glucosamine residues, NDST3 is likely to perform its action in a Golgi compartment trans of the compartment where NDST1 and/or NDST2 reside. The minimal amounts of NDST3 transcript detected in the cells may also suggest that a so far unidentified N-deacetylase could be responsible for deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine residues."
https://openalex.org/W2132795835,"The human monoclonal antibody rHIgM22 enhances remyelination following spinal cord demyelination in a virus-induced murine model of multiple sclerosis. Using three-dimensional T2-weighted in vivo spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we have therefore assessed the extent of spinal cord demyelination, before and after 5 weeks of treatment with rHIgM22, to determine whether antibody enhanced remyelination can be detected by MRI. A significant decrease was seen in T2 high signal lesion volume following antibody treatment. Histologic examination of the spinal cord tissue reveals that this decrease in lesion volume correlates with antibody promoted remyelination. To show that rHIgM22 enters the spinal cord and colocalizes with demyelinating lesions, we used ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particle (USPIO)-labeled antibodies. This may be considered as additional evidence to the hypothesis that rHIgM22 promotes remyelination by local effects in the lesions, likely by binding to CNS cells. The reduction in high signal T2-weighted lesion volume may be an important outcome measure in future clinical trials in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2086438617,"Neuro-immune interactions enable mutual regulation of the nervous and immune systems. To date, evidence exists for manipulations of immune cells by neurotransmitters in the periphery. In this study, we suggest the existence of a pathway by which the brain affects immune cells. The pathway we describe here is mediated by dopamine receptors expressed on activated T cells, termed blasts. Blasts can cross the blood brain barrier regardless of antigen specificity and can therefore encounter neurotransmitters in the brain. We show that blasts have a unique response to dopaminergic activation, which has no counterpart in resting T cells. Dopaminergic activation of blasts induces a Th1 bias in their cytokine profile and causes changes in surface marker expression. We further suggest that these changes can subsequently be transferred to peripheral T cells. We have tested this pathway in two in vivo systems: in rats exogenously administered with L-dopa, and in schizophrenia, which is characterized by a central nervous system-restricted increase in dopamine. In both models, peripheral T cells exhibit similar features to those of dopaminergically activated blasts. The existence of such a pathway by which the brain can regulate immune cells opens a conceptually new direction in neuro-immune interactions."

To elucidate the role of Hsp90 in promoting the degradation of oxidized calmodulin (CaMox), we have purified red blood cell 20 S proteasomes free of Hsp90 and assessed their ability to degrade CaMox in the absence or presence of Hsp90. Purified 20 S proteasome does not degrade CaMox unless Hsp90 is added. CaMox degradation is sensitive to both proteasome and Hsp90-specific inhibitors and is further enhanced in the presence of 2 mm ATP. Irrespective of the presence of Hsp90, we find that unoxidized CaM is not significantly degraded. Direct binding measurements demonstrate that Hsp90 selectively associates with CaMox; essentially no binding is observed between Hsp90 and unoxidized CaM.

Although these larger protein complexes mediate the ATP-dependent degradation of proteins associated with ubiquitin-dependent processes or the formation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens, the 20 S core complex has been suggested to be largely responsible for the degradation of oxidized proteins, which occurs in an ATP-independent manner (5Shringarpure R.

Substrate access to the catalytic core of the 20 S proteasome is hindered by the amino-terminal sequences of the α-subunits, which under resting conditions function to close the entrance to the pore and prevent nonspecific proteolysis (15Groll M.

However, proteasomes are in a dynamic equilibrium between a closed and an open conformation, which is slow relative to the time scale of protein turnover; further, the open form is stabilized by the presence of substrate (18Osmulski P.A.

Binding of the regulatory 11 S REG or 19 S protein complexes to the α-subunits of the 20 S proteasome stabilizes the open conformation and facilitates regulated substrate access (16Groll M.

The chaperone Hsp90 has also been suggested to bind the α-subunits of the 20 S proteasome and to function as a regulator of proteasome function (21Conconi M. Petropoulos I. Emod I. Turlin E.

The high affinity association between purified Hsp90 and the 20 S proteasome (Kd < 100 nm), in conjunction with the routine presence of Hsp90 in purified preparations of the 20 S proteasome, suggests a possible functional involvement in modulating protein degradation (7Husom A.D.

Indeed, functional inhibitors of Hsp90 modulate the rates of protein degradation and inhibit the activity of the proteasome in cellular assays (21Conconi M. Petropoulos I. Emod I. Turlin E.

Thus, observed age-dependent decreases of both the total cellular abundance of Hsp90 and the amount of Hsp90 that co-purifies with the 20 S proteasome have the potential to profoundly affect cell function (7Husom A.D.

Understanding the mechanism underlying observed cellular responses to modulators of Hsp90 function is compounded by the multiple cellular functions ascribed to Hsp90. These functions include, in addition to the minimization of irreversible protein aggregation between unstructured proteins, associations with other chaperones (e.g. Hsp70 and p50) to assist in protein folding as well as stabilizing ∼200 different signaling proteins (26Young J.C.

The association between Hsp90 and the 20 S proteasome has, furthermore, been implicated in modulating the dynamic exchange of the 11 S REG and 19 S regulatory subunits to affect proteasome function, as an allosteric activator of the proteasome, and to play a critical role in protecting the 20 S proteasome against oxidative inactivation (2Friguet B.

Thus, there is expected to be an important interplay between oxidative modification and subsequent degradation of key signaling proteins by the proteasome and the oxidative inactivation of the proteasome itself. In this latter respect, conditions of oxidative stress are known to result in the selective oxidative modification of calcium regulatory proteins to modulate signal transduction and cellular energy metabolism (40Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Front Biosci. 2000; 5: D504-D526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, multiple methionines in the calcium regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM) are selectively oxidized to their corresponding methionine sulfoxides during aging, resulting in a reduced ability to activate a range of different target proteins, including the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase, nitric-oxide synthase, and the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel (41Gao J.

Given the known role of Hsp90 in modulating the stability and function of ∼200 different signaling proteins and the role of the 20 S proteasome in the selective degradation of oxidized proteins, we have investigated the possible functional involvement of Hsp90 in facilitating the degradation of oxidized CaM by the 20 S proteasome. This work is, in part, motivated by the fact that the vast majority of previous measurements of 20 S proteolytic activity used fluorogenic peptides or extensively alkylated and unfolded proteins as substrates. These artificial substrates may not reflect proteasome function vis-à-vis normal physiological substrates (40Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J.

To assess the possible role of Hsp90 in mediating the selective degradation of oxidized proteins by the 20 S proteasome, we have isolated the 20 S proteasome from erythrocytes free of Hsp90 and measured the ability of the proteasome to recognize and degrade native and oxidized CaMox. CaM was chosen both because of its key role in intracellular signal transduction and because of its functional sensitivity to oxidative stress (41Gao J. Yin D. Yao Y. Williams T.D. Squier T.C.

Furthermore, CaM has previously been shown to be degraded in a ubiquitin-independent mechanism by the proteasome (47Tarcsa E. Szymanska G. Lecker S. O'Connor C.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 202095-220301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hsp90 selectively recognizes oxidized CaM and promotes its degradation by the 20 S proteasome. Under these conditions, native (unoxidized) CaM is not a substrate for the proteasome. Likewise, Hsp90 has no influence on the rates of fluorogenic peptide cleavage, indicating that Hsp90 specifically promotes the degradation of oxidized CaM through a direct binding interaction that modulates access to the active sites in the 20 S proteasome central chamber. We find that 20 S proteasomes alone do not degrade native or oxidized CaM to any appreciable extent.

The concentration of H2O2 was determined by using the published extinction coefficient, ϵ240 nm = 39.4 ± 0.2 m-1 cm-1 (52Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Following incubation, the reaction was stopped by dialyzing the sample against multiple changes of distilled water (3 × 5 liters) buffered with sodium bicarbonate at 4 °C. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—CaM samples were injected onto the column (C4, 5 cm × 1 mm inner diameter, Micro-Tech Scientific, Vista, CA) equilibrated with 40% ethanol in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetyl and eluted with a linear gradient (3% ethanol/min) developed with an Ultra Plus II MicroLC system (Micro-Tech Scientific) at a flow rate 50 μl/min. For routine analyses in which the total CaM oxiform distribution was to be determined, a hand-packed C18 trap column (1 cm × 1 mm inner diameter) was used with elution by 60% ethanol in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetyl. The high pressure liquid chromatography or trap column was coupled to the electrospray source of a Q-Tof-2™ mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). Mass spectra were acquired with the instrument cone voltage at 60 eV and dry gas nitrogen heated to 150 °C. The experiment was set up such that ESI-MS and ESI-CID spectra were acquired in alternating 5-s scans. Mass spectra in the ESI-MS mode were acquired in the mass range 1000–3000. ESI-CID mass spectra were acquired on ions in 14+ charge state clusters in the mass range 100–3000. Precursor ions were selected with a window 11 Da wide to cover all possible oxiforms in the 14+ cluster for oxidized CaM. The collision energy was 40 eV. To obtain whole protein CaM mass spectra, charge deconvolution of all major charge states (15+ through 6+) was performed. CaM Proteolysis by the 20 S Proteasome—The rates of proteolysis using oxidized CaM as a substrate for the proteasome were determined using two different assays, essentially as described previously (13Ferrington D.A.

Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, these assays involved (i) monitoring the disappearance of the integrated intensity of CaM bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and (ii) measurement of the initial release of peptides generated by proteasome cleavage using fluorescamine, which forms a fluorescent adduct with the amino termini of peptides (13Ferrington D.A.

Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Identical experimental conditions were used for both assays, which involved the incubation of native or oxidized CaM (12 μm) with the 20 S proteasome (0.6 μm) in the absence and presence of Hsp90 (2.5 μm) at 37 °C in 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm of one of the following buffers: MES (pH 6.0), PIPES (pH 6.5), MOPS (pH 7.0), or Tris (pH 7.5). In all cases, the 20 S proteasome in the absence or presence of Hsp90 was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h prior to substrate addition, permitting an efficient functional reconstitution. The purity of individual proteins was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Oxidation of CaM results in a mobility change on SDS-PAGE gels, with CaMox running at a significantly higher apparent mass in comparison with unoxidized CaM (13Ferrington D.A. Sun H. Murray K.K. Costa J. Williams T.D. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 937-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Labeling of CaM—CaM was reacted with Alexa Fluor 532 using a protein labeling kit purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and separated from unreacted probe using a G-25 Sephadex column. The final molar stoichiometry was approximately 1 mole of fluorophore/mole of CaM. FCS Measurements—Fluorescence correlation spectra were obtained using a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope modified for these measurements, in which excitation was from a Coherent Verdi laser (532 nm) focused by a ×100 objective lens (S Fluo100, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence was collected using the same objective, separated by a 550DCLP dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT), split by a cube beam splitter (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ), and then filtered using an HQ560 emission filter (Chroma Technology). The resulting fluorescence was detected by a pair of SPCM-AQR-14 avalanche photodiodes (PerkinElmer Optoelectronics). The output was detected by a Flex01-05D multi-tau correlator (Correlator.com, Bridgewater, NJ), run under dualcross mode for 300 s. Evaluation of the curves was carried out by Origin's nonlinear fitting function (MicroCal software, Northampton, MA). Oxidized CaM as a Substrate for the 20 S Proteasome—A quantitative assessment of the extent of CaM oxidation was obtained using ESI-MS. Before oxidative modification, CaM exhibits a single major ESI-MS peak corresponding to a mass of 16,706 ± 3 Da (Fig. 2), in close agreement with the theoretical average mass of vertebrate CaM expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (16,705.4 Da). An additional peak at 16,688 ± 3 Da corresponds to a dehydration artifact associated with ionization in the mass spectrometer (54Gao J. Yin D.H. Yao Y. Sun H. Qin Z. Ch Schoneich Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1115-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Overnight exposure of CaMWT to H2O2 resulted in a 144-Da mass shift of the ESI-MS spectrum, with a major peak at 16,850 ± 3 Da corresponding to the oxidative modification of all nine methionines to their corresponding methionine sulfoxides in CaMox. Hsp90 Mediates the Selective Degradation of CaMox by the 20 S Proteasome—We have investigated the possible involvement of Hsp90 in the degradation of oxidized CaM by the 20 S proteasome. In the absence of added Hsp90, neither native nor oxidized CaM is significantly degraded over the 24-h time course of the experiment, as determined following a densitometric analysis of the SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3). These results suggest that Hsp90, which co-purified with 20 S proteasome isolated from liver homogenates, may have been a key factor in the selective degradation of CaMox previously attributed to the 20 S proteasome alone (13Ferrington D.A. Sun H. Murray K.K. Costa J. Williams T.D. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 937-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we have reconstituted the 20 S proteasome with Hsp90. Following the addition of a 4-fold molar excess of Hsp90 to the 20 S proteasome, the selective degradation of CaMox is observed. Under these conditions, the rate of degradation (i.e. 0.55 ± 0.04 nmol CaMox degraded/mg of 20 S proteasome/h) is virtually identical to that observed previously for 20 S proteasome purified from liver, which contains tightly associated Hsp90 (13Ferrington D.A. Sun H. Murray K.K. Costa J. Williams T.D. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 937-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, native CaM is not significantly degraded over this time span, irrespective of the presence or absence of Hsp90. These results demonstrate that association of Hsp90 with the 20 S proteasome facilitates the preferential degradation of CaMox. Hsp90 Dependence of CaMox Degradation by 20 S Proteasome—An appreciation of the molar stoichiometry of Hsp90 for maximal activation of the 20 S proteasome is necessary to understand the underlying mechanism of CaMox degradation. We have, therefore, assessed the ability of the 20 S proteasome to degrade CaMox in the presence of variable amounts of Hsp90. One observes a linear increase in the rates of CaMox degradation upon increasing the molar stoichiometry from 0 to 4 moles of Hsp90/mole of 20 S proteasome, with no additional increase in activity upon the addition of more Hsp90 (Fig. 4). Given the high affinity association between Hsp90 and the 20 S proteasome (Kd < 100 nm) (21Conconi M. Petropoulos I. Emod I. Turlin E. Biville F. Friguet B. Biochem.

Nakayama E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1303-1309PubMed Google Scholar), the maximal activation of 20 S proteasome degradative activity in the presence of four Hsp90 molecules suggests the occupancy of all regulatory sites on the 20 S proteasome. The lack of any additional activation in the presence of excess Hsp90 argues against an indirect role, in which Hsp90 binding to CaMox would, for example, expose specific binding sites on CaMox that result in targeted protein degradation by the 20 S proteasome. Further, since Hsp90 normally exists as a dimer in solution (55Garnier C. Barbier P. Devred F. Rivas G. Peyrot V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11770-11778Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), these results are consistent with a model in which maximal activation of the 20 S proteasome involves association with two Hsp90 dimers. Minimal Effect of Hsp90 on Fluorogenic Peptide Hydrolysis by 20 S Proteasome—The underlying mechanism responsible for the Hsp90-mediated degradation of CaMox was investigated using the fluorogenic peptide Cbz-LLE-Na, which is commonly used to access the peptidy"
https://openalex.org/W2015458192,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently associated with vascular risk factors. β-amyloid peptides (AβP), the main component of senile plaques typical of AD, circulate in soluble globular form in bloodstream. Interestingly, AβP is able to induce endothelial dysfunction, and this effect may represent the link between vascular and neuronal pathophysiological factors involved in AD. We aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying globular AβP-induced vascular toxicity. Using several methodological approaches, we have observed that in vascular tissues globular AβP is unable to induce oxidative stress, one of the mechanisms hypothesized involved in β-amyloid toxicity. More important, we have demonstrated that globular AβP is able to localize on vascular endothelium, where it inhibits eNOS enzymatic activity. In particular, AβP enhances eNOS phosphorylation on threonine 495 and serine 116 and reduces acetylcholine-induced phosphorylation on serine 1177. Such an effect depends on a PKC signaling pathway, as suggested by its phosphorylation on serine 660. In fact, selective inhibition of the calcium-dependent group of PKC is able to rescue β-amyloid-induced alteration of eNOS phosphorylation, NO production, and endothelial vasorelaxation. The activation of these Ca2+-dependent pathways is probably due to the ability of AβP to evoke Ca2+ leakage from inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors on endoplasmic reticulum. Our data demonstrate that globular AβP-induced endothelial NO dysfunction can be attributed to an alteration of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, which could lead to the activation of calcium-dependent group of PKC with a consequent change of the eNOS phosphorylation pattern. These mechanisms could contribute to shed further light on the toxic effect of β-amyloid in vascular tissues.

It is a major cause of death and a growing public health problem as life expectancy in the general population increases (1Gasparini L. Racchi M. Binetti G. Trabucchi M. Solerte S.B. Alkon D. Etcheberrigaray R. Gibson G. Blass J. Paoletti R. Govoni S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 17-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Typical features of AD are the senile plaques present in the brain, cerebral blood vessels, and other tissues (2Zhu Y.J. Lin H. Lal R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1244-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The plaques are composed mainly of fibrillar amyloid β peptides (AβP) generated from the amyloid precursor protein, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane glycoprotein. The amyloid peptides, constituted primarily of 39–42 residues (AβP 1–39, 1–40, and 1–42), are released continuously during cellular metabolism. These peptides circulate in soluble globular form in the bloodstream (3Bhatia R. Lin H. Lal R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Kisilewski R. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 772-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and accumulate on the vascular wall of AD patients (5Kalaria R.N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 72: 193-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In the brain, soluble β-amyloid monomers are able to deposit and transform into insoluble and fibrillar aggregates, forming amyloid plaques (6Soto C. Castano E.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Pitschke M. Prior R. Haupt M. Riesner D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although AD has been considered for long to be of nonvascular origin, a growing body of recent studies has indicated the possibility that vascular risk factors could be involved in the pathophysiology of AD (8de la Torre J.C. Stroke. 2002; 33: 1152-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In particular, patients with AD have morphological alterations of the cerebral vasculature, reduced cerebral blood flow, and increased permeability of blood brain barrier, which mainly depends on endothelial function (9Su G.C. Arendash G.W. Kalaria R.N. Bjugstad K.D. Mullan M. Brain Res. 1999; 818: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the fibrillar form of AβP is able to produce severe damage of the endothelial lining with deleterious effects on endothelial nitric oxide (NO) function (10Niwa K. Younkin L. Ebeling C. Turner S.K. Westaway D. Younkin S. Ashe K.H. Carlson G.A. Iadecola C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 9735-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Iadecola C.

McLendon C. Sutton T. Mullan M. Nature. 1996; 380: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This effect of the fibrillar form of AβP has been attributed to an enhanced NO catabolism due to an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (13Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar, 14Sowers J.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1999-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), since superoxide scavengers are able to prevent fibrillar AβP-induced endothelial toxicity (11Iadecola C. Zhang F. Niwa K. Eckman C. Turner S.K. Fischer E. Younkin S. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K.K. Carlson G.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 15Markesbery W.R. Arch. Neurol. 1999; 56: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that also the circulating form of AβP is able to provoke endothelial NO dysfunction, but it is still unclear whether this alteration is oxidative stress-dependent. On the other hand, a recent study suggests that the soluble form of AβP could exert its deleterious effect on endothelial NO, inhibiting nitric-oxide synthase enzymatic activity (16Venturini G. Colasanti M. Persichini T. Fioravanti E. Ascenzi P. Palomba L. Cantoni O. Musci G. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1970-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the aim of this study was to explore whether the globular circulating form of AβP impairs endothelial NO function by enhancing oxidative stress or influencing NO production and, subsequently, clarify the molecular mechanisms involved. Pure, scrambled and biotinylated AβP 1–40 were obtained from BIOSOURCE. AβP 1–40 stock solution (0.5 mg/ml) was prepared by dissolving the peptides in deionized water and stored as aliquots at -20 °C until used. Experimental Animals—Experiments were conducted in male Wistar Kyoto rats (Charles River Laboratory) 10–14 weeks old. All experimental procedures were in accordance with guidelines for research in animals of our institution. Vascular Reactivity Studies—Vascular reactivity studies have been performed on aortas as previously described (17Vecchione C. Maffei A. Colella S. Aretini A. Poulet R. Frati G. Gentile M.T. Fratta L. Trimarco V. Trimarco B. Lembo G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (ACh; 10-9–10-5m; Sigma) and to sodium nitroprusside (10-10-10-6m; Sigma) with or without AβP (10-6m) was expressed as a percentage of reduction in contraction obtained with phenylephrine (10-6m; Sigma). Basilar arteries were dissected and excised free of connective and adipose tissue and mounted on a micromyograph, as previously described by Mulvany et al. (18Korsgaard N. Mulvany M.J. Hypertension. 1988; 12: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Stewart R. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1998; 65: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Deane R.

Hofman F. Kindy M. Stern D. Zlokovic B. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Basilar arteries were precontracted with 10-6 mol/liter phenylephrine, and the vasodilator responses to increasing doses of substance P (10-9–10-5 mol/liter), alone or after a 30-min preincubation with 10-6 mol/liter AβP, were tested. Measurement of ex Vivo Aortic O2.¯ Production—Lucigenin-enhanced methodology is specific for O2.¯ detection. Segments of thoracic aorta were isolated, placed in a modified Krebs buffer (17Vecchione C. Maffei A. Colella S. Aretini A. Poulet R. Frati G. Gentile M.T. Fratta L. Trimarco V. Trimarco B. Lembo G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), added with 20 mm Na-Hepes, and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 37 °C. After 5 min of dark adaptation, scintillation vials containing 2 ml of Krebs-Hepes buffer with 5 μm lucigenin were placed into a scintillation counter switched to the out-of-coincidence mode. Chemiluminescence values were obtained at 40-s intervals over 15 min, and readings were averaged. The vessel was dried, and the dry weight was measured. Lucigenin counts were expressed as counts/min/mg of the dry weight of vessel. Background counts were determined by vessel-free incubations and subtracted from vessel readings. Soon after the isolation, vessels were treated with 1 μm AβP 1–40 for 1 h in Krebs buffer. Vascular rings were frozen at -20 °C and cut into 20-μm-thick sections in a Jung CM3000 Cryostat (Leica). Sections were placed onto polylisinated microscope slides, either incubated at room temperature for 30 min with DHE (Sigma; 10 μm) and protected from light or blocked with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies (5 μg/ml; Transduction Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C and with anti-IgG TRITC-conjugated for 1 h at room temperature. Images were observed under an Axiophot2 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter (excitation 450–490 nm; emission 515–560 nm), using × 200 magnification and an imaging system. Evaluation of NO Production—Aortic rings were incubated for 2 h in the darkness in aerated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs buffer containing DAF-2 diacetate (DAF-2DA; 10 μm; Alexis). During this time, aortic rings were treated with AβP (1 μm; 1 h) and/or ACh (1 μm; 5 min). Vascular rings were frozen at -20 °C and cut in 10-μm-thick sections placed onto microscope slides without any mounting medium or coverslip. Specimens were observed with a fluorescence microscope. 24-bit color pictures were taken at three different wavelengths (corresponding to green, red, and blue fluorescence) using a digital camera system coupled to imaging software (Spot; Diagnostic Instruments) under constant exposure time, gain, and offset. To account for fluorescence decay, all images were taken in the first 30-s of light exposure. The images were then merged so that the 515-nm emitted fluorescence due to DAF appeared green above a purple all-wavelengths-emitted autofluorescence background derived from the fibers of the vessel. Green fluorescence intensity was quantified using the imaging software. Analysis of AβP Localization—Vascular rings were treated with 1 μm biotinylated AβP or biotinylated scrambled peptide for 1 h, frozen at -20 °C, and cut into 20-μm-thick sections. Sections were placed onto polylisinated microscope slides, blocked with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase for 15 min at room temperature. Biotinylated AβP and peptide were revealed by DAB-chromogen solution (NovaRed; Vector), and slides were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Endothelium was revealed with anti-von Willebrand antibodies (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). HAEC were plated as 10,000 cells/well in multiwell chamber slides and treated with 1 μm biotinylated AβP for 1 h. The cells were fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Biotinylated AβP was revealed with DAB-chromogen solution (NovaRed; Vector) after incubation of slides with streptavidin-peroxidase for 15 min at room temperature. Afterward, slides were incubated with anti-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) antibodies (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C and then with anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were dried out, mounted with an aqueous based mounting medium, and observed under the microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Red and green images were merged. Evaluation of eNOS Enzymatic Activity—eNOS activity was evaluated measuring the conversion of [14C]arginine to [14C]citrulline in vitro. Aortas were treated with AβP or scrambled AβP (1 μm, 1 h) and then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenated in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. 50 μg of protein extract were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.3 μm BH4, 1 μm FAD, 1 μm FMN, 0.1 μm CAM, 1 mm NADPH, 0.5 μCi [14C]arginine). The reaction was blocked on ice for 10 min with stop buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA). The reaction mix was applied to a 1-ml column containing Dowex AG 50 × 8 resin that had been equilibrated with stop buffer. [14C]citrulline was eluted twice with 2 ml of water, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Analysis of eNOS Phosphorylation Pattern—After isolation and treatment with AβP (1 μm, 1 h) and/or ACh (1 μm, 10 min) and/or Gö6976 (2 μm, 15 min; Calbiochem), proteins were extracted as previously described. 20 μg of protein extract were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in blocking solution (5% milk in TBS-T), incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-eNOS (Thr495), anti-phospho-eNOS (Ser1117), or anti-phospho-eNOS (Ser116) (1 μg/ml; Cell Signaling). Membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were revealed by an ECL kit. Normalization was performed with anti-NOS-III antibodies (1 μg/ml; Tansduction Laboratories) for 3 h at room temperature and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 in TBS-T). Proteins were revealed as above. The intensity of the bands was quantified by scanning densitometry using NIH Image version 1.61 software. Analysis of PKC Phosphorylation—After isolation and treatment with AβP(1 μm, 1 h) and/or ACh (1 μm, 10 min), specimens were lysated as above. 20 μg of protein extract were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were electroblotted on nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membrane was blocked at room temperature for 1 h in blocking solution (5% milk in TBS-T), incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-Ser660-PKC (1 μg/ml; Cell Signaling). Membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were revealed as above. Primary and secondary antibodies were completely removed with Stripping Buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m glacial acetic acid) at room temperature for 30 min. Membranes were blocked in blocking solution (5% milk in TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with anti-PKC (1 μg/ml; Transduction Laboratories) for 3 h at room temperature, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 in TBS-T). Proteins were revealed as above. The intensity of the bands was quantified as described. Analysis of Calcium Release in Endothelial Cells—Intracellular calcium was imaged using a calcium-sensitive dye Fluo4AM and a PerkinElmer Life Sciences laser confocal microscope. Cells were cultured on coated glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp.). To load dye into the cells, 5 μm Fluo4AM was incubated with cells for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and with 100 μm EGTA and then washed in PBS and observed at room temperature in Calcium-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum (Invitrogen). The focal planes were set across the middle of the cell bodies. After about 5 min of observation, 1 μm AβP, 1 μm ACh, 1 μm scrambled peptide, and 10 μm furanophostin alone or in combination were added to each HAEC culture. Furanophostin was added to cells permeabilized with 1% picric acid. Some cell cultures were preincubated with 50 μm 2APB for 10 min before the addition of the stimuli. Images were collected at 10-s intervals. The concentration of calcium was calculated according to the equation [Ca2+] = Kd*(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where Kd is the dissociation constant for Fluo4AM, F is fluorescence, and Fmin and Fmax are the minimum and maximum fluorescence measured by adding 10 μm ionomycin in the presence of 10 mm EGTA or 10 mm CaCl2, respectively. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by t test or by two-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni test, as appropriate. A two-tailed value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Soluble AβP Induces Endothelial NO Dysfunction—Soluble AβP was able to attenuate ACh-induced dose-dependent vasodilatation on rat aorta, although it had no effect on basal vascular tone. In contrast, AβP did not influence vasodilatation evoked by sodium nitroprusside (Fig. 1, A–C), indicating that globular AβP impaired endothelial NO function but not vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to NO. Moreover, in a vessel of the cerebral district, such as basilar artery, we observed that AβP was able to attenuate the vasodilation induced by SubP, a potent nitric oxide stimulus on cerebral arteries (Fig. 1B). Finally, soluble AβP was able to attenuate ACh-induced DAF-2 fluorescence, whereas it did not alter the basal DAF-2 signal (Fig. 1D). Soluble AβP Does Not Induce Vascular Oxidative Stress—To explore whether soluble AβP was able to induce endothelial NO dysfunction by enhanced production of ROS, we evaluated vascular O.¯. production by three different methodologies: lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, DHE dyeing, and nitrotyrosine detection. All revealed that soluble AβP, neither alone nor after incubation with ACh, induced ROS production in vessels. However, our experimental setting was able to detect oxidative stress evoked by angiotensin II, used as positive control (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, preincubation with a ROS scavenger such as superoxide dismutase was unable to rescue ACh-induced vasodilatation altered by AβP (Fig. 1A), suggesting that oxidative stress was not involved in vascular toxicity mediated by the globular form of AβP. Soluble AβP Localizes on Vascular Endothelium and Attenuates eNOS Activity—Our data revealed that biotinylated AβP, but not a different biotinylated scrambled peptide (data not shown), was able to localize mainly on vascular endothelium (Fig 3A). Furthermore, the analysis of the catalytic activity of eNOS on aortic rings showed that soluble AβP, but not scrambled AβP, significantly inhibited the enzymatic activity (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that globular AβP interacts with the endothelial lining, where AβP inhibits eNOS enzymatic activity. Soluble AβP Alters eNOS Phosphorylation Pattern—Since eNOS activity can be regulated by a coordinated control of enzyme phosphorylation on serine and threonine (24Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar), we extended our analysis to these latter. As shown in Fig. 4A, in control conditions, eNOS was phosphorylated in Thr495 and in Ser116. The addition of ACh markedly reduced eNOS Thr495 phosphorylation and concomitantly evoked an increase in eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation, whereas it did not influence eNOS Ser116 phosphorylation. The exposure to soluble AβP alone markedly increased eNOS Thr495 and Ser116 phosphorylation. More important, in the presence of soluble AβP, ACh was unable to induce the dephosphorylation of Thr495 and Ser116 and the concomitant phosphorylation of Ser1177. Soluble AβP Alters eNOS Phosphorylation Pattern and Endothelial Dysfunction through a Calcium-dependent Group of PKC (cPKC)-dependent Mechanism—It has been described that eNOS phosphorylation on Thr495 is mediated by a PKC signaling (27Mitchell B.J. Chen Z.P. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). To explore the impact of PKC on AβP-induced eNOS phosphorylation pattern, we tested the effect of the globular AβP in the presence of bisindolylmaleimide (data not shown), a pan-PKC inhibitor, and of Gö6976, a selective inhibitor of cPKC. Fig. 4A shows that in the presence of Gö6976 alone, both Thr495 and Ser116 were phosphorylated as in control conditions. The addition of ACh together with Gö6976 evoked the reduction of Thr495 and Ser116 phosphorylation level and the increase of Ser1177 phosphorylation level. In the presence of AβP and Gö6976, ACh was still able to induce dephosphorylation of Thr495 and Ser116 and concomitant phosphorylation of Ser1177, indicating that AβP is unable to evoke its effect on eNOS phosphorylation when the cPKCs are inhibited. Finally, the exposure to Gö6976 was also able to rescue the impaired ACh-evoked vasorelaxation observed in the presence of AβP (Fig. 4B). Soluble AβP Influences the PKC-signaling Pathway in Vascular Tissues—To further investigate the hypothesis that a PKC-dependent mechanism could be involved in AβP-induced eNOS dysfunction, we analyzed PKC Ser660 phosphorylation, an activating site of the enzyme, in vascular tissues. We revealed that AβP markedly increased phosphorylation at this site, indicating that AβP induces PKC structural modifications necessary to the enzyme to be fully active and suggesting the involvement of PKC in AβP-induced vascular effect (Fig. 5). Soluble AβP Induces Ca2+Leakage in Endothelial Cells—To clarify how AβP affects calcium-dependent signaling, we investigated whether AβP alters calcium homeostasis in endothelial cells. AβP induced a slow and progressive increase in intracellular calcium concentration within minutes, lasting for all of the period of observation after the addition of the peptide (Fig. 6A), whereas a scrambled peptide did not induce any variation in intracellular calcium concentration. Moreover, acetylcholine evoked as expected a spike of intracellular calcium, which returned at basal levels after 10 min, and the same occurs when AβP is added to cells at the same time of ACh. More important, we observed that, 20 min after the addition of AβP, since basal intracellular calcium concentration had drifted up, the gain of acetylcholine-evoked response was significantly reduced but the final concentration of intracellular calcium reached the same extent as that previously observed with ACh alone. Finally, with a 20-min exposure to a scrambled peptide, Ach-evoked calcium response was unaffected (Fig. 6B). Soluble AβP Localizes in the Perinuclear Region of Endothelial Cells—To explore the mechanisms through which AβP was able to induce intracellular calcium leakage, we analyzed AβP localization in HAEC. Fig. 7A shows that biotinylated AβP, evident as red fluorescence, was able to localize in the perinuclear region (a) of endothelial cells, suggesting a colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum. IP3Rs are the main represented Ca2+ channels in the endoplasmic reticulum of endothelial cells. For this issue, we analyzed the localization of IP3R and observed that these latter localize in the perinuclear region too, as indicated by the green fluorescence in b. The merge of the two images showed that the two proteins colocalize (c), suggesting that AβP may influence IP3R function. Soluble AβP Induces Calcium Leakage from IP3 Receptors of the Endoplasmic Reticulum—In light of the data described above, we further investigate the effect of AβP on intracellular calcium stores regulated by IP3R. In particular, the calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum evoked by furanophostin, a selective non receptorial IP3R agonist, was significantly blunted by previous exposure to β-amyloid (Fig. 7B). More important, β-amyloid-induced calcium leakage was prevented by the administration of 2APB, a selective IP3R antagonist (Fig. 7C). These data indicate that β-amyloid influences IP3R function with a consequent calcium leakage from intracellular calcium stores (Fig. 8). Our results show that the globular form of AβP, at a dose comparable with the increased levels observed in AD patients (3Bhatia R. Lin H. Lal R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), induces an endothelial NO dysfunction through the reduction of eNOS enzymatic activity. In particular, the globular form of AβP alters the pattern of eNOS phosphorylation via a cPKC-dependent signaling pathway. This cPKC activation could be due to the ability of the globular form of AβP to induce calcium leakage from intracellular stores. Our data further demonstrate that globular AβP localizes mainly on vascular endothelium, where AβP evokes endothelial dysfunction, which is due neither to an altered vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to NO nor to an enhanced NO catabolism by oxidative stress. Actually, the vasodilatation to exogenous NO is unaffected by the presence of soluble AβP. In addition, the evaluation of oxidative stress with different biochemical methodologies as well as the use of ROS scavengers clearly demonstrates that soluble β-amyloid-induced endothelial dysfunction does not depend on oxidative stress. Our conclusion is consistent with results obtained in other studies, which have demonstrated that AβP is unable to increase ROS production in other cell systems (3Bhatia R. Lin H. Lal R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data demonstrate a defect in NO production in the presence of the globular AβP as revealed by an impaired eNOS enzymatic activity and a concomitant reduced presence of agonist-stimulated endothelial NO in both aorta and basilar artery. The fact that basal NO production observed with DAF-2 was not influenced by AβP and the awareness that the measurement of eNOS activity is performed in a reaction buffer containing all of the factors eNOS needs to be fully active, among which is the Ca2+-calmodulin complex, suggest that AβP-induced eNOS alteration can be observed only when eNOS is stimulated. Actually, eNOS enzymatic activity is also influenced by its phosphorylation at three or more sites (i.e. Ser1177, Thr495, and Ser116) (21Bauer P.M. Fulton D. Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. Kemp B.E. Jo H. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14841-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Among these phosphorylation sites, the regulation of eNOS Ser1177 has been most extensively characterized. In fact, Ser1177 phosphorylation increases NO production by facilitating the electron transport inside the enzyme (22Fleming I. Busse R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 23Fulton D. Gratton J.P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar, 25Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar, 26Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Thr495 is basally phosphorylated and may be dephosphorylated in response to several stimuli. Phosphorylation at this site inhibits eNOS activity by opposing the binding of the Ca2+-calmodulin complex to the specific site on the enzyme, thus preventing its activation (27Mitchell B.J. Chen Z.P. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17625-17628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 28Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Like Thr495, Ser116 is basally phosphorylated and is dephosphorylated in response to certain stimuli in endothelial cells, even if the relative contribution of Ser116 to the regulation of NO production by eNOS has not been well established (26Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that acetylcholine, like the other previously observed agonists, influences the eNOS phosphorylation pattern, inducing dephosphorylation of the residues Ser116 and Thr495 and a concomitant phosphorylation of Ser1177. Interestingly, the addition of β-amyloid alters per se eNOS phosphorylation status, markedly increasing eNOS Thr495 and Ser116 phosphorylation. More important, in this latter condition, acetylcholine is not able to exert its action on eNOS phosphorylation pattern. Thus, we can infer that AβP affects eNOS enzymatic activity influencing the enzyme's responsiveness to certain activating stimuli such as acetylcholine. Recent studies have shown that a PKC-dependent signaling pathway is able to increase eNOS Thr495 phosphorylation (28Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Dimmeler S. Kemp B.E. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and previous observations have shown that AβP is able to induce PKC activation in neuronal cells (29Luo Y. Hawver D.B. Iwasaki K. Sunderland T. Roth G.S. Wolozin B. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Kuperstein F. Reiss N. Koudinova N. Yavin E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, we extended our analysis to clarify whether a PKC-dependent signaling pathway is implicated in AβP-induced endothelial dysfunction. We observed that the globular AβP is able to induce PKC phosphorylation on Ser660, a key step in the activation of the enzyme (31Casabona G. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 21: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that AβP interferes with PKC signaling pathway also in vascular tissues. The fact that bisindolilmaleimide, a pan-PKC inhibitor, was able to abolish AβP effect on eNOS phosphorylation, confirmed an involvement of PKC in AβP-induced endothelial dysfunction. Since it has been reported that AβP is able to elicit calcium current in several cell lines (32Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), we assessed the involvement of cPKC in AβP-induced eNOS dysfunction. In particular, we demonstrated that the use of a selective inhibitor of cPKC is able to rescue β-amyloid impact on eNOS phosphorylation, NO production, and endothelial vasorelaxation, narrowing to a cPKC-dependent signaling pathway the responsibility of the vascular toxicity induced by the globular form of β-amyloid. Both eNOS and cPKC signaling tightly depend on intracellular calcium dynamics, since eNOS is activated by the Ca2+-calmodulin complex and calcium promotes the interaction of cPKC with plasma membrane. Thus, we explored whether AβP vascular effects are associated with an altered calcium homeostasis. On this issue, we observed that AβP induced a slow and progressive increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration in endothelial cells. This finding is in agreement with a previous report showing that soluble β-amyloid is able to induce calcium leakage in fibroblasts (32Lin H. Bhatia R. Lal R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the analysis of calcium dynamics during acetylcholine stimulation showed that concomitant infusion of AβP is unable to affect acetylcholine-induced calcium response, ruling out a rapid effect of AβP on acetylcholine-stimulated calcium signaling. Indeed, more important, when cells were preincubated with AβP, in a condition similar to that in which AβP induced vascular abnormalities, the gain of acetylcholine-evoked calcium response was significantly reduced even if the total amount of calcium reached in the cytoplasm after acetylcholine stimulation was similar. Thus, these data indicate that AβP induces alteration in calcium dynamics slowly. Our results were obtained in endothelial cells cultured in a Ca2+-free medium, clearly indicating that the observed leakage comes from intracellular calcium stores. The main source of intracellular calcium is the endoplasmic reticulum, from which calcium can reach cytoplasm through specific channels (33Taylor C. Broad L.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 370-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In particular, on the endoplasmic reticulum of endothelial cells is mainly present a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel (IP3R), which allows mobilization of intracellular calcium stores in response to IP3 (34Tiruppathi C. Minshall R.D. Paria B.C. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2003; 39: 173-185Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). On this issue, we observed that β-amyloid localizes in the perinuclear region and, more important, colocalizes with IP3R on the endoplasmic reticulum of endothelial cells, suggesting a possible effect of AβP on these intracellular calcium channels. This hypothesis was tested using selective IP3R agonist and antagonist. Actually, after preincubation with AβP, the challenge of IP3R function by a selective nonreceptorial agonist showed an impairment of the calcium release through these intracellular calcium channels. More important, the concomitant administration of a selective IP3R antagonist with AβP was able to prevent the previously observed calcium leakage. All together, these data demonstrate that AβP impairs IP3R function, altering intracellular calcium stores. Thus, AβP alters intracellular calcium dynamics, and this action could account for its effect on eNOS function. In fact, an increase in intracellular calcium concentration stimulates NO production through direct eNOS activation but at the same time activates cPKC, which diminishes NO generation by eNOS Thr495/Ser116 phosphorylation; the resulting eNOS enzymatic activity is the balance of these two opposite mechanisms (35Hirata K. Kuroda R. Sakoda T. Katayama M. Inoue N. Suematsu M. Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 180-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of our study and other studies, we can suggest that soluble circulating AβP-induced intracellular calcium leakage could shift the calcium-dependent balance toward a sensitization of the cPKC pathway with severe reduction of eNOS enzymatic activity. In fact, it is well characterized that cPKC signaling needs for its activation a calcium threshold (EC50 = 200 nm) lower than eNOS (EC50 = 400 nm) (13Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar, 31Casabona G. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 21: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of β-amyloid, intracellular calcium concentration reaches first the level that leads to an activation of cPKC signaling, which phosphorylates eNOS on Thr495 so that, when challenged with acetylcholine, eNOS may be unable to bind Ca2+-calmodulin complex and catalyze NO production. On the other hand, when cPKC is inhibited, the intracellular calcium concentration observed after acetylcholine stimulation is able to activate eNOS even in presence of AβP. Thus, the effect of AβP on calcium dynamics influences the balance of intracellular signaling pathways between cPKC and eNOS, leading to an altered endothelial function. Since soluble β-amyloid peptides are a physiological product of the cellular catabolism, in light of our results, it is tempting to speculate that the negative impact of AβP on eNOS function could also play a pathophysiological role in other conditions of vascular dysfunction. Thus, our data contribute to shed further light not only on the vascular pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the onset of AD but also on the identification of novel factors that participate to the complex network controlling vascular function."
https://openalex.org/W2053265454,"Connective tissue growth factor [CTGF]/CCN2 is a prototypic member of the CCN family of regulatory proteins. CTGF expression is up-regulated in a number of fibrotic diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, where it is believed to act as a downstream mediator of TGF-beta function; however, the exact mechanisms whereby CTGF mediates its effects remain unclear. Here, we describe the role of CTGF in cell migration and actin disassembly in human mesangial cells, a primary target in the development of renal glomerulosclerosis. The addition of CTGF to primary mesangial cells induced cell migration and cytoskeletal rearrangement but had no effect on cell proliferation. Cytoskeletal rearrangement was associated with a loss of focal adhesions, involving tyrosine dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, increased activity of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, with a concomitant decrease in RhoA and Rac1 activity. Conversely, Cdc42 activity was increased by CTGF. These functional responses were associated with the phosphorylation and translocation of protein kinase C-zeta to the leading edge of migrating cells. Inhibition of CTGF-induced protein kinase C-zeta activity with a myristolated PKC-zeta inhibitor prevented cell migration. Moreover, transient transfection of human mesangial cells with a PKC-zeta kinase inactive mutant (dominant negative) expression vector also led to a decrease in CTGF-induced migration compared with wild-type. Furthermore, CTGF stimulated phosphorylation and activation of GSK-3beta. These data highlight for the first time an integrated mechanism whereby CTGF regulates cell migration through facilitative actin cytoskeleton disassembly, which is mediated by dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, loss of RhoA activity, activation of Cdc42, and phosphorylation of PKC-zeta and GSK-3beta. These changes indicate that the initial stages of CTGF mediated mesangial cell migration are similar to those involved in the process of cell polarization. These findings begin to shed mechanistic light on the renal diabetic milieu, where increased CTGF expression in the glomerulus contributes to cellular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2054397999,"A reduction in stress tolerance is a hallmark of the aging process, and the lowered functional capacity observed in aged organisms is associated with an increased rate of oxidative stress and a greater susceptibility of aged tissues to oxidative injury. In this report, we show that chronic systemic administration of a superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase mimetic (EUK-189), delivered over a 1 month period via osmotic pump, prevents heat stress-induced liver injury by dramatically decreasing oxidative damage in aged animals. Widespread liver injury was present in old but not young vehicle-treated rats in response to a 2 day heating protocol. However, SOD/catalase mimetic treatment markedly decreased the hyperthermia-induced liver injury associated in old animals. The reversal of damage with EUK-189 was associated with an improvement in intracellular redox status and a striking reduction in hepatocellular lipid peroxidation. EUK-189 treatment also blocked the activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1), which is a redox-sensitive early response transcription factor involved in the regulation of cellular stress responses. These results demonstrate that oxidative stress plays a unique role in age-related hyperthermic injury and suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at improving redox potential, such as chronic SOD/catalase mimetic treatment, can prevent the oxidative-mediated damage associated with environmental stress."

https://openalex.org/W1983474267,"Activation of NF-κB requires two highly related kinases named IKKα and IKKβ that share identity in the nature and positioning of their structural domains. Despite their similarity, the kinases are functionally divergent, and we therefore sought to identify any structural features specific for IKKα or IKKβ. We performed bioinformatics analysis, and we identified a region resembling a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) that exists only in IKKβ and that we named the UBL-like domain (ULD). Deletion of the ULD rendered IKKβ catalytically inactive and unable to induce NF-κB activity, and overexpression of only the ULD dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB activity. The ULD could not be functionally replaced within IKKβ by ubiquitin or the corresponding region of IKKα, whereas deletion of the equivalent section of IKKα did not affect its catalytic activity against IκBα or its activation by NF-κB-inducing kinase. We identified five residues conserved among the larger family of UBL-containing proteins and IKKβ, and alanine scanning revealed that the leucine at position 353 (Leu353) is absolutely critical for IKKβ-induced NF-κB activation. Most intriguingly, the L353A mutant was catalytically active but, unlike wild-type IKKβ, formed a stable complex with the NF-κB p65 subunit.

Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). A defining feature of most NF-κB responses is their inducibility. Thus, NF-κB proteins are normally sequestered inactive in the cytoplasm of resting cells through interaction with distinct members of a family of inhibitory proteins named the IκBs. Following appropriate stimulation, the IκB proteins are degraded, and NF-κB migrates to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA motifs within the promoters of its target genes (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). The most intensely studied NF-κB activation pathway is that induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In response to TNF stimulation, IκB proteins (typified by IκBα) become rapidly phosphorylated on two specific N-terminal serine residues, and this signals their subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Degradation of IκBα liberates NF-κB dimers that most commonly consist of the p65 (RelA) and p50 NF-κB subunits, and these p65:p50 heterodimers regulate the expression of a wide range of genes that include those of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leukocyte adhesion molecules, and anti-apoptotic proteins (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

Arguably, the most important intermediate signaling event in this pathway is the phosphorylation of IκB proteins, and tremendous effort from a number of laboratories has identified and characterized the signal-responsive kinase complex responsible for this crucial step (4Karin M. Yamamoto Y. Wang Q.M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). This catalytic activity resides in a complex of proteins named the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that consists of three core subunits named IKKα (IKK1), IKKβ (IKK2), and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) that is also know as IKKγ (5Mercurio F.

A number of elegant genetic studies have clearly demonstrated that phosphorylation of IκBα in response to TNFα signaling is absolutely dependent upon IKKβ and NEMO (10Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this pathway that results in liberation of mainly p50:p65 heterodimers is now named the “classical” NF-κB pathway (17Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). Activation of the classical pathway underlies the vast majority of the known functions of NF-κB in immune and inflammatory responses, cell survival, and development (17Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). In contrast to the fundamental role for IKKβ in the classical pathway, IKKα appears for the most part to be functionally redundant (12Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 13Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S.

Thus IκBα degradation and activation of NF-κB in response to TNFα remains intact in cells derived from IKKα–/– animals, whereas this is completely ablated in both IKKβ–/– and NEMO–/– cells (10Li Q.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, evidence exists that IKKα plays a role in mediating the classical pathway in response to a subset of inducers including receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) (18Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and it is known to be able to phosphorylate IκBα in vitro, albeit with a lower relative activity than IKKβ (19Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, IKKα has been shown to migrate to the nucleus and to perform an epigenetic function by regulating histone phosphorylation in the vicinity of classical NF-κB-dependent genes (20Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 21Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In addition, IKKα may play a regulatory role within the IKK complex by trans-phosphorylating IKKβ (22O'Mahony A. Lin X. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and loss of IKKα appears to affect the expression of a number of genes activated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines (23Li X. Massa P.E. Hanidu A. Peet G.W. Aro P. Savitt A. Mische S. Li J. Marcu K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45129-45140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms responsible for these effects remain unclear. Nevertheless, despite these separate lines of evidence, it remains that the classical NF-κB pathway is absolutely dependent upon IKKβ and that IKKα is dispensable for IKKβ-dependent IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB activation. In contrast to its lack of function in classical NF-κB signaling, IKKα is the key regulator of a recently described “noncanonical” NF-κB pathway (24Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 25Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U.

Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In this pathway IKKα specifically phosphorylates the C terminus of the NF-κB p100 subunit (also known as NF-κB2) inducing its ubiquitination and processing, and in a manner analogous with IκBα degradation, p100 processing releases its N-terminal portion (p52) as a transcriptionally active heterodimer with RelB (24Dejardin E.

Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). This series of events is completely independent of IKKβ and NEMO and functions in IKKβ–/– and NEMO–/– cells (24Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 25Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat.

Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). A critical component of the noncanonical pathway is the upstream kinase NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase) that phosphorylates and activates IKKα (27Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), and activation of this pathway is absent in aly/aly mice that carry a mutated NIK gene (24Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 27Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Studies of aly/aly mice together with accumulated genetic evidence clearly demonstrate that the noncanonical NF-κB pathway is critical for the maturation of B-cells and development of lymphoid organs. Consistent with this, p100 processing only occurs in response to signals from a subset of TNF receptor family members involved in lymphoid organogenesis and B-cell maturation as follows: B-cell activating factor receptor, CD40, and the lymphotoxin-β receptor (24Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 25Claudio E.

Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In turn, the known inducers of this pathway are the B-cell activating factor, CD40L, heterotrimeric LTα1β2, and LIGHT that also binds the lymphotoxin-β receptor. Only five genes have been definitively identified as targets of the noncanonical pathway: the cytokine B-cell activating factor and the chemokines SLC (CCL21), ELC (CCL19), BLC (CXCL13), and SDF-1α (CXCL12) (24Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Consistent with the genetically defined function of the pathway, these are all involved in either B-cell maturation or the development and function of lymphoid organs. It is clear from these studies that although they physically interact within the IKK complex, IKKα and IKKβ perform highly distinct functions. Although it has been suggested that IKKα functions in the noncanonical pathway via a separate IKKα-alone complex, such a complex has yet to be described and molecularly characterized (24Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Despite this potentially separate complex however, it remains that the IKKs share remarkable structural similarity, and consequently the precise mechanisms that underlie their divergent functions remain unknown. In this regard both kinases possess N-terminal catalytic domains, centrally located leucine zippers through which they interact, and a helix-loop-helix domain that is critical for their activation (29Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 72-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In addition, IKKα and IKKβ each contain a C-terminal NEMO-binding domain (NBD), which we have demonstrated to facilitate NEMO interaction with both kinases (30May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In light of these similarities, we therefore sought to identify any novel domains or sequences within either of the IKKs that might account for their functional divergence. We describe here the identification and functional characterization of a novel ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) we have identified in IKKβ. Such a domain does not exist in IKKα. We demonstrate that deletion of or mutations within the ULD profoundly affect the function of IKKβ, whereas loss of the identical segment of IKKα does not affect its activity. Furthermore, our findings strongly suggest that the IKKβ ULD plays a fundamental role in regulating the interaction of the IKK complex with p65. We therefore conclude that the ULD is absolutely critical for the induced activity of IKKβ, and we further hypothesize that this novel IKKβ-specific domain contributes to the functional divergence of the IKKs. Cell Culture and Reagents—HeLa, HEK293, and COS cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Mouse anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-FLAG-coupled agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-Xpress was purchased from Invitrogen; rabbit anti-p65 (SA-171) was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against either rabbit or mouse IgG were both from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-IκBα and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-p100 (NF-κB2) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Recombinant human TNFα was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Plasmids and PCR Mutagenesis—Full-length cDNA clones of human IKKα and IKKβ were the generous gifts from Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). All subcloning and mutagenesis procedures were performed by PCR using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All PCR conditions and primer sequences are available upon request. Wild-type and mutated IKKβ cDNAs were inserted between the KpnI and NotI restriction sites of pcDNA-3.1-Xpress (Invitrogen), and all IKKα cDNAs were inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the same vector. FLAG-tagged versions of wild-type and mutated IKKα and IKKβ were constructed by subcloning into the EcoRI/XhoI and HindIII/NotI sites within pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma), respectively. Human p65 in pcDNA3 was described previously as were the GST-p65N and GST-p65C constructs (32Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNAs encoding human ubiquitin and NIK were obtained from HeLa cDNA by PCR cloning using Pfu DNA polymerase. Point mutations within the ULD were made using the QuickChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. To make all of the domain substitution mutations in IKKβ and IKKα, an EcoRV site was inserted into the IKKβ-d.ULD or IKKα-d.78 mutant across the join. The fragments to be inserted into the kinases were generated by using primers flanked by EcoRV sites, and these were then ligated into the EcoRV-cut IKK constructs. The GST-ULD fusion protein was constructed by inserting a PCR-generated fragment encompassing the IKKβ ULD (encoding amino acids Leu307 to Met384) between the EcoRI and NotI sites within pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). A cDNA encoding human NEMO was obtained as described previously (31May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). GST-NEMO was constructed by subcloning the full-length cDNA into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T1. The fusion of GST with the first 90 amino acids of human IκBα (GST-IκBα-(1–90)) that was used as a substrate in the kinase assays was described previously (31May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). GST proteins were made in Escherichia coli (BL21) by treating transformed bacteria with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) and following the manufacturer's protocol for protein recovery provided with the vector. Interaction Analysis—For GST pull-down analysis, IKKα or IKKβ in pcDNA3.1 were transcribed in vitro and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT-T7 Quick system from Promega (Madison, WI). Labeled proteins (1 μl of reticulocyte lysate) were incubated with GST alone, GST-NEMO, or GST-ULD (1 μg) in 100 μl of TNT (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture, Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C for 30 min, and 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was then added and incubated a further 15 min. Proteins were then precipitated and washed extensively in TNT before addition of sample buffer (20 μl). Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and the resulting gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, fixed, and then examined autoradiographically. For transient transfection studies, 1 × 106 COS cells grown in 6-well trays were transfected with 1 μg of total DNA using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). All DNA/FuGENE 6 incubations were performed at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA per 3 μl of FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were lysed in 500 μl of TNT, and then complexes were immunoprecipitated (IP) by using anti-FLAG-coupled agarose beads. A portion of each lysate taken prior to immunoprecipitation (5%) was retained for analysis (pre-IP). Precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using epitope-specific (anti-FLAG or anti-Xpress) antibodies that were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Dual luciferase reporter assays were performed essentially as described previously (30May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 105 HeLa cells grown on 12-well plates were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 with the NF-κB-dependent reporter construct pBIIx-luc (0.2 μg/well) together with the Renilla luciferase vector (0.02 μg/well). Total DNA concentration in each experiment (1.0 μg/well) was maintained by adding the appropriate empty vector to the DNA mixture. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay kit from Promega. In some experiments the levels of transfected proteins in 20 μg of lysates were examined by immunoblotting by using appropriate epitope tag-specific antibodies. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—For immune complex kinases assays, 1 × 106 HeLa cells grown on 6-well plates were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the FLAG-tagged version of the kinase constructs using the FuGENE 6 reagent as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were either untreated or treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) and then lysed on ice in 500 μl of TNT for 15 min. Protein content in each lysate was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and then normalized among the samples. Proteins in lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG (M2)-coupled agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and the precipitates were washed extensively in TNT and then kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP). Precipitates were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing appropriate GST-fused substrate proteins and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). The substrate was then precipitated using glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) and washed extensively with TNT. Beads were then suspended in 20 μl of sample buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%). Kinase activity was determined by autoradiography. Sequence Alignment—All sequence alignments were performed using MacVector software from Accelrys (San Diego, CA). IKKβ Contains a Novel Ubiquitin-like Domain—We performed a series of proteomic data base searches using various web-based profiles, motifs, and protein family analysis programs to identify any novel structural or functional domains in either IKKα or IKKβ. As expected, the previously described structural features of both kinases, including their N-terminal catalytic domains, central leucine zipper motifs, and C-terminal helix-loop-helix and NEMO-binding domains, were identified through a combination of separate approaches. Most surprisingly, however, analysis of the complete amino acid sequence of human IKKβ using the ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) molecular biology server and the PROSITE data base (us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/scanprosite) identified a region of 78 amino acids from Leu307 to Met384 corresponding to the Ubiquitin_2 (type 2 ubiquitin-like) profile (PROSITE document PDOC00271; PROSITE accession number PS50053). No such domain was detected in either IKKα or the related kinase IKKe/IKKi. Despite this sequence identity with ubiquitin, we noted that the PROSITE data base classified this region of IKKβ as a false positive for the Ubiquitin_2 profile, suggesting that it does not belong to the larger family of ubiquitin-like domain-containing proteins per se (us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/nicesite.pl?PS50053). Therefore, we further investigated the IKKβ sequence using the Profilescan Server (hits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN) maintained by the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, and this analysis identified the same region as a strong match with a normalized match score of 9.548 (statistical interpretation of match score significance is available at hits.isb-sib.ch/doc/motif_score.shtml). Subsequent search analysis using the Protein Families (Pfam) data base of Alignments and Hidden Markov Models (www.sanger.ac.uk/software/pfam/search.shtml) identified a shorter ubiquitin domain (Pfam document: PF00240) between residues 319 and 354 of IKKβ, and this was also recognized, together with the longer PROSITE Ubiquitin_2 profile, as a ubiquitin domain (document IPR000626) using the Interpro search analysis program of the European Bioinformatics Institute (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/index.html). Therefore, we conclude from this accumulated bioinformatic evidence that IKKβ but not IKKα contains a domain located between residues 307 and 384 (more specifically between residues 319 and 354) that displays significant sequence identity with ubiquitin. Although this region strongly resembles both ubiquitin and the UBLs present in a family of unrelated proteins (33Hartmann-Petersen R. Gordon C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the false positive classification from the original PROSITE search led us to name this region the UBL-like domain (ULD) of IKKβ. The position of the IKKb ULD and its sequence alignment with human ubiquitin are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. Similar alignment of the corresponding region of IKKa (Ile307–Val384) (Fig. 1C) demonstrates the significantly lower degree of similarity and identity with ubiquitin. The IKKβ ULD Is Required for Catalytic Function—Ubiquitin-like domains have been identified in an expanding family of proteins (33Hartmann-Petersen R. Gordon C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which include the yeast DNA repair enzyme Rad23 and its human homologues HHR23A and -B, the yeast cell cycle control protein Dsk2, and its human homologues hPLIC-1 and -2, the causative gene of autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism na"
https://openalex.org/W2091536674,"The prediabetic period in type I diabetes mellitus is characterized by the loss of first phase insulin release. This might be due to islet infiltration mediated by mononuclear cells and local release of cytokines, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. To determine the role of cytokines in insulin exocytosis, we have presently utilized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to image and analyze the dynamic motion of single insulin secretory granules near the plasma membrane in live beta-cells exposed for 24 h to interleukin (IL)-1beta or interferon (IFN)-gamma. Immunohistochemistry observed via TIRFM showed that the number of docked insulin granules was decreased by 60% in beta-cells treated with IL-1beta, while it was not affected by exposure to IFN-gamma. This effect of IL-1beta was paralleled by a 50% reduction in the mRNA and the number of clusters of SNAP-25 in the plasma membrane. TIRF images of single insulin granule motion during a 15-min stimulation by 22 mm glucose in IL-1beta-treated beta-cells showed a marked reduction in the fusion events from previously docked granules during the first phase insulin release. Fusion from newcomers, however, was well preserved during the second phase of insulin release of IL-1beta-treated beta-cells. The present observations indicate that IL-1beta, but not IFN-gamma, has a preferential inhibitory effect on the first phase of glucose-induced insulin release, mostly via an action on previously docked granules. This suggests that beta-cell exposure to immune mediators during the course of insulitis might be responsible for the loss of first phase insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W2093009462,"Nitrosative stress with subsequent inflammatory cell death has been associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. Expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and production of nitric oxide (NO) have been frequently elevated in many inflammatory disorders. NO can rapidly react with superoxide anion, producing more reactive peroxynitrite. In the present study, exposure of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells to the peroxynitrite donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1) induced apoptosis, which accompanied depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH), c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and DNA fragmentation. During SIN-1-induced apoptotic cell death, expression of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) was elevated. SIN-1 treatment resulted in elevated production of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), an endogenous PPARγ activator. Preincubation with 15d-PGJ2 rendered PC12 cells resistant to nitrosative stress induced by SIN-1. 15d-PGJ2 fortified an intracellular GSH pool through up-regulation of glutamylcysteine ligase, thereby preventing cells from SIN-1-induced GSH depletion. The above findings suggest that 15d-PGJ2 may act as a survival mediator capable of augmenting cellular thiol antioxidant capacity through up-regulation of the intracellular GSH synthesis in response to the nitrosative insult.

Inflammation is a central feature of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and neurovascular disease (1Breitner J.C. Neurobiol.

Brain Res. 2002; 953: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Excessive nitric oxide (NO) production is considered as one of the main causes of neuronal cell death (5Heales S.J. Bolanos J.P. Stewart V.C. Brookes P.S. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Many studies suggest that the cytotoxic effect of NO is mediated via peroxynitrite formed by the reaction between NO and superoxide anion (O2−) (6Brune B. Gotz C. Messmer U.K. Sandau K. Hirvonen M.R.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The level of 3-nitrotyrosine, a relatively specific marker of nitrosative damage caused by peroxynitrite, has been reported to increase in Alzheimer's disease as well as other neurodegenerative disorders (8Beal M.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar).Up-regulation of COX has also been frequently observed in patients with neurological symptoms (9Kitamura Y. Shimohama S. Koike H. Kakimura J. Matsuoka Y. Nomura Y. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Taniguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). COX is a rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the synthesis of a series of prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes that have multiple physiological functions. Two isoforms of COX have been described: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and produces prostanoids that are involved in maintaining homeostatic functions. COX-2 is induced under proinflammatory conditions and can mediate deleterious effects in the neurodegenerative disorders (9Kitamura Y. Shimohama S. Koike H. Kakimura J. Matsuoka Y. Nomura Y. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Taniguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Nogawa S. Zhang F. Ross M.E. Iadecola C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2746-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of COX-2 in neuronal cell death is conflicting. As prolonged intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with COX-2 inhibitory effects has been reported to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and delay its onset (2McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Exp. Gerontol. 1998; 33: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 11Stewart W.F. Kawas C. Corrada M. Metter E.J. Neurology. 1997; 48: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), a number of studies have focused on the neuroprotective effects of NSAIDs. Recently, it has been recognized that the neuroprotective effects of NSAIDs are mediated via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) activation, independently of COX-2 inhibition (12Asanuma M. Miyazaki I. Tsuji T. Ogawa N. Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi. 2003; 23: 111-119PubMed Google Scholar).Cyclopentenone PGs have various biological effects, such as growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis, differentiation, antioxidant, and anti-inflammation etc. depending on its concentrations and the cell type (13Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 14Levonen A.L. Dickinson D.A. Moellering D.R. Mulcahy R.T. Forman H.J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Among them, PGJ2 is synthesized by non-enzymatic dehydration within the cyclopentane ring of PGD2, one of the major products of COX-2. PGJ2 is metabolized further to yield Δ12-PGJ2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2). Members of the J2 series PGs are characterized by the presence of a reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functional group in the cyclopentenone ring that can bind covalently by means of the Michael addition reaction with nucleophiles such as the free sulfhydryls of GSH and cysteine residues in cellular proteins (15Fukushima M. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 189-199PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 15d-PGJ2 has been reported to exert dual effects on cell survival and apoptosis (14Levonen A.L. Dickinson D.A. Moellering D.R. Mulcahy R.T. Forman H.J. Darley-Usmar V.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Emi M. Maeyama K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Na H.K. Surh Y.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, 15d-PGJ2 at relatively high concentrations causes cell death, whereas at submicromolar concentrations this cyclopentenone PG elicits cytoprotective effects. However, molecular mechanisms underlying cytoprotective effects of 15d-PGJ2 are poorly understood. In this study we hypothesize that 15d-PGJ2 rescues PC12 cells from the nitrosative stress induced by peroxynitrite through up-regulation of intracellular GSH biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—15d-PGJ2 and GW9662 were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). 3-Morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1) and Mn (II) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) prophyrin (MnTBAP) were purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123) was supplied from Fluka and Riedel-de Haën (Buchs, Switzerland). Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The in situ cell death detection kit was supplied by Roche Applied Science. GSH and buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, horse serum, F-12, and N-2 supplement were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.Cell Culture and Viability Measurement—PC12 cells were maintained routinely in DMEM supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2, and 90% air. All cells were cultured in poly-d-lysinecoated culture dishes. Cells were cultured for 1 day before treatment, and switched to serum-free N-2-defined medium. Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described previously (19Jang J.H. Surh Y.J. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1100-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar).Measurement of Peroxynitrite—Generation of peroxynitrite from SIN-1 was determined spectrophotometrically using DHR 123. The peroxynitrite-dependent oxidation of DHR 123 to rhodamine 123 was measured according to the previously reported method (20Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). At pH 7.4 and 37 °C, peroxynitrite production from SIN-1 decomposition reaches a steady state after ∼3 min and remains essentially linear for up to 60 min. One hour after SIN-1 addition, the medium was collected and mixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μm DHR 123. After 10 min of incubation at 22 °C, the fluorescence intensity of DHR 123 was measured using a microplate reader (TECAN GmbH, Salzburg, Austria) at an excitation wavelength of 500 nm and an emission at 536 nm (ϵ500 nm = 78,800 m-1 cm-1). Peroxynitrite concentrations were calculated from the DHR 123 fluorescence intensity (21Takakura K. Beckman J.S. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Synthetic peroxynitrite oxidizes DHR 123 to rhodamine 123 with 44% efficiency (20Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Thus, formation of rhodamine 123 from DHR 123 after reaction with SIN-1 was corrected to total peroxynitrite production by dividing the value by 0.44.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed with anti-poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), anti-phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), anti-JNK, and anti-PPARγ polyclonal antibodies (1:500 dilution, all products of Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (19Jang J.H. Surh Y.J. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1100-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). An anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used for detection of COX-2.PGE2 Enzyme Immunoassay—PC12 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/4 ml in 60-mm plates and incubated for the desired times after 3 mm SIN-1 treatment. PGE2 released into incubation medium was measured by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). 50 μl of culture medium was used for an assay. PGE2 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically according to the instructions provided from the supplier.15d-PGJ2 Enzyme Immunoassay—PC12 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/7 ml in 100-mm plates, and the 15d-PGJ2 production was determined by using an enzyme immunoassay kit according to the instructions provided from the supplier (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). In brief, the culture media and cell lysates were transferred to a goat anti-rabbit IgG microtiter plate and incubated with anti-15d-PGJ2 polyclonal antibody and alkaline phosphatase conjugated with 15d-PGJ2 at room temperature for 2 h. The plate was rinsed three times with washing solution and further incubated with 200 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate at 37 °C for 3 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μl of stop solution. The changes in absorbance at 405 nm were measured using a spectrophotometric microplate reader.Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End-labeling (TUNEL)—The commercially available in situ Cell Death Detection kit was used to assess the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. PC12 cells (5 × 105 cells/3 ml in chamber slide) were fixed for 30 min in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min at room temperature and further incubated in a permeabilizing solution (0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 2 min at 4 °C. The cells were incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C followed by labeling with peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody (Fab fragment) for additional 30 min. After staining with diaminobenzidine for 10 min, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted with 50% glycerol.Measurement of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (ΔΨm)— The fluorescent probe TMRE was used to measure the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm). This dye binds in a manner dependent on the mitochondrial electric potential. PC12 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/2.4 ml in chamber slides. The cells were pretreated with 2 μm 15d-PGJ2 for 24 h, and SIN-1 was then added to the medium at the final concentration of 3 mm. After 5 h of incubation with SIN-1, PC12 cells were washed with DMEM and incubated with TMRE (150 nm) in DMEM for additional 30 min at 37 °C, then washed twice with DMEM, and examined under a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). TMRE rapidly equilibrates between cellular compartments due to potential differences. A decrease in TMRE fluorescence is indicative of a reduction in ΔΨm. The fluorescence was monitored as red fluorescence (excitation: 555 nm, emission: >590 nm) at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. For the quantification of the fluorescence intensity, four fields containing about 400 cells were analyzed, and the fluorescence intensity of the red was determined as the indicator of ΔΨm.GSH Measurement—The GSH content was measured using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (GSH-400 method, OXIS International, Portland, OR) using 4-chloro-1-methyl-7-trifluoromethyl-quinolinum methylsulfate. Cells were harvested and homogenized in metaphosphoric working solution. After centrifugation, 50 μl of R1 solution (solution of chromogenic reagent in HCl) was added to the 700 μl of supernatant, followed by gentle vortex mixing. Following the addition of 50 μl of R2 solution (30% NaOH), the mixtures were incubated at 25 ± 3 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the clear supernatant was read at 400 nm. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit.Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from PC12 cells using TRIzol® (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed according to standard techniques. PCR conditions for glutamylcysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC), glutamylcysteine ligase modulatory (GCLM), and the housekeeping, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes were as follows: for GCLC and GAPDH, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 45 s and for GCLM, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min; 60 °C for 1 min; 68 °C for 2 min; and 68 °C for 7 min (22Tian L. Shi M.M. Forman H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The sequence of each primer used is as follows (forward and reverse, respectively): GCLC subunit, 5′-GCC AAG GTC ATC CAT GAC AAC-3′ and 5′-AGT GTA GCC CAG GAT GCC CTT-3′; GCLM subunit, 5′-AGA CCG GGA ACC TGC TCA AC-3′ and 5′-CAT CAC CCT GAT GCC TAA GC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-AGT GTA GCC CAG GAT GCC CTT-3′ and 5′-GCC AAG GTC ATC CAT GAC AAC-3′. Amplification products were resolved by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under ultraviolet light. All primers were purchased from Bionics (Seoul, Korea).GCL Reporter Gene Assay—The luciferase reporter construct pGL3 containing the rat GCLC promoter was prepared as reported previously (23Yang H. Wang J. Huang Z.Z. Ou X. Lu S.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was carried out by using DOTAP Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Transfection was performed at 1–3×105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Twelve hours later, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with N-2 medium containing Me2SO or 2 μm 15d-PGJ2 and incubated for additional 24 h. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The result was expressed as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.Measurement of GCL Activity—GCL activity was determined as described by Seelig and Meister (24Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3534-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The assay measures the rate of oxidation of NADH (assumed to be equal to the rate of formation of ADP) from the change in absorbance at 340 nm in reaction mixtures containing the following: 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2ATP, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 mm l-glutamate, 10 mm l-α-aminobutyrate, 20 mm MgCl2,2mm Na2EDTA, 0.2 mm NADH, 17 μg/ml of pyruvate kinase, and 17 μg/ml of lactate dehydrogenase. Cells were harvested and lysed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the supernatant was used for the assay. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. The enzyme activity was expressed in international units per mg of protein and calculated by using the molar extinction coefficient, 6.22 for NADH.RESULTSSIN-1 Caused Apoptotic Death in PC12 Cells—To assess the nitrosative stress-induced cytotoxicity, PC12 cells were treated for 24 h with varying concentrations of the peroxynitrite donor SIN-1. Peroxynitrite released from SIN-1 was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity derived from DHR 123 oxidized by peroxynitrite (Fig. 1A). In parallel with increased peroxynitrite release, SIN-1 treatment decreased the cell viability as determined by the MTT reduction assay (Fig. 1A). Cells treated with 3 mm SIN-1 exhibited gradual cleavage of PARP, one of the common biochemical features of apoptosis (Fig. 1B). The SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity was abolished by cotreatment with the membrane permeable peroxynitrite scavenger MnTBAP (Fig. 1C). Activation of the JNK-signaling cascades has been frequently implicated in neuronal cell death induced by a wide variety of toxicants (25Kang C.D. Jang J.H. Kim K.W. Lee H.J. Jeong C.S. Kim C.M. Kim S.H. Chung B.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). JNK activation via phosphorylation during the SIN-1-induced PC12 cell death coincided with the PARP cleavage (Fig. 1D). Both events were blocked by the peroxynitrite scavenger MnTBAP, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1D).SIN-1 Treatment Induced Activation of COX-2 and PPARγ— To investigate the probable involvement of inflammatory pathways in nitrosative PC12 cell death induced by SIN-1, COX-2 expression was measured by Western blot analysis. Fig. 2A illustrates a time-related up-regulation of COX-2 in cells exposed to peroxynitrite. The release of PGE2, one of the major COX-2 products, was also substantially elevated by SIN-1 treatment (Fig. 2A). To clarify the role of COX-2 during the nitrosative cell death, two selective COX-2 inhibitors, SC-58635, and NS-398, were coincubated with 2 mm SIN-1 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2B, both of these COX-2 selective inhibitors aggravated SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity.Fig. 2COX-2 and PPARγ expression induced by cytotoxic concentrations of SIN-1 in PC12 cells.A, SIN-1-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in PC12 cells. Cells were exposed to 3 mm SIN-1 for indicated time periods. COX-2 expression was examined by Western blot analysis, and PGE2 production was measured 24 h later by using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay kit. B, aggravation of SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity by COX-2 inhibitors. PC12 cells were treated with SC-58635 (15 and 30 μm) or NS-398 (30 μm) in the presence or absence of 2 mm SIN-1 for 24 h. The cell viability was measured by the MTT reduction assay. C, SIN-1-induced PPARγ expression. PC12 cells were exposed to 3 mm SIN-1 for indicated time periods. PPARγ induction was examined by Western blot analysis. D, enhancement of SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. PC12 cells were treated with GW9662 (1, 5, or 10 μm) together with 2 mm SIN-1 for 24 h. The results are presented as means ± S.D. (n = 3). *, significantly different from the group treated with SIN-1 alone (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PPARγ is implicated in anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic properties of several NSAIDs. PPARγ expression was increased in cells treated with a proapoptotic concentration of SIN-1 (Fig. 2C). To determine the role of PPARγ during the nitrosative PC12 cell death, a PPARγ antagonist GW9662 was added to the media together with SIN-1. As illustrated in Fig. 2D, GW9662 aggravated SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity. Since pharmacologic inhibition of both COX-2 and PPARγ further enhanced the SIN-1-induced cell death, it is likely that the product of COX-2 capable of acting as a PPARγ ligand exerts cytoprotective effects. Based on the fact that 15d-PGJ2 produced in the arachidonic cascade mediated by COX-2 is an endogenous activator of PPARγ, the possible involvement of this cyclopentenone PG in the cellular defense mechanism against SIN-1-induced cell death was explored.15d-PGJ2 was hence proposed as a probable common denominator in the COX-2- and PPARγ-mediated processes that confer cell survival or adaptation in response to the nitrosative insult. The levels of 15d-PGJ2 was elevated in both culture media and cell lysates after SIN-1 stimulation (Fig. 3, A and B). To clarify the role of elevated 15d-PGJ2 during the SIN-1-induced nitrosative cell death, two selective COX-2 inhibitors (SC-58635 and NS-398) were coincubated with SIN-1. As illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B, both of SC-58635 and NS-398 significantly reduced SIN-1-induced 15d-PGJ2 production, at the concentration that aggravated nitrosative cell death.Fig. 3Protective effect of 15d-PGJ2 against SIN-1-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells.A and B, SIN-1-induced 15d-PGJ2 production and the effect of COX-2 inhibitors. PC12 cells were treated with SC-58635 (30 μm) or NS-398 (30 μm) in the absence or presence of SIN-1 (2 mm) for 24 h. 15d-PGJ2 production in the culture media (A) and cell lysates (B) was measured by using the 15d-PGJ2 enzyme immunoassay kit. C, 15d-PGJ2-mediated protection of PC12 cells from SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity. After 24 h of preincubation with 15d-PGJ2 (0.5 or 2 μm), PC12 cells were exposed to 3 mm SIN-1 for additional 24 h, and the cell viability was determined by the MTT reduction assay. The results are presented as means ± S.D. (n = 3). *, significantly different from the SIN-1 alone group (p < 0.01).

Co-treatment of 15d-PGJ2 failed to protect PC12 cells against the SIN-1-induced cytotoxicity (data not shown), suggesting that 15d-PGJ2 itself is not a direct peroxynitrite scavenger.The protective effect of 15d-PGJ2 against SIN-1-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by analyzing several hallmarks of apoptosis. As illustrated in Fig. 3D, a nontoxic concentration (i.e. 2 μm) of 15d-PGJ2 ameliorated SIN-1-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation as revealed by TUNEL staining. Mitochondrial depolarization occurs in the cells undergoing apoptosis. TMRE is detected as red fluorescence in the intact mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, in cells treated with a proapoptotic concentration (i.e. 3mm) of SIN-1 alone for 5 h, the red staining disappeared, indicating the perturbation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Fig. 3E). 15d-PGJ2 pretreatment restored the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Changes in ΔΨm values were quantified by measuring the average values of the red fluorescence intensity of four fields, each containing about 400 cells (Fig. 3E). It has been known that peroxynitrite may directly induce mitochondrial dysfunction through nitration of mitochondrial proteins, such as complex I, II, V respiratory system (26Boyd C.S. Cadenas E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 27Brown G.C. Borutaite V. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Leist M.

Preservation of ΔΨm by 15d-PGJ2 implies that this cyclopentenone PG may increase the intracellular antioxidant capacity, which can efficiently quench peroxynitrite.15d-PGJ2 Rescued PC12 Cells from Nitrosative Stress through Augmentation of Cellular GSH—To elucidate the plausible mechanism by which 15d-PGJ2 protected against apoptosis induced by SIN-1, the levels of peroxynitrite were initially compared in the cells with and without 15d-PGJ2 pretreatment (Fig. 4A). As illustrated in Fig. 4A, the accumulation of peroxynitrite in SIN-1-treated cells was significantly reduced by 2 μm 15d-PGJ2. The free thiol group of GSH, the most abundant cellular antioxidant, is a target for peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation. In support of this notion, intracellular GSH was substantially depleted at 6 h after SIN-1 treatment (Fig. 4B). Preincubation of PC12 cells with 2 μm 15d-PGJ2 for 24 h restored the GSH to the control level (SIN-1 alone, 64.8 ± 5.55% of the control GSH level versus SIN-1 plus 15d-PGJ2, 102.1 ± 6.51% of control, p < 0.05). The GSH depletion coincided with the cytotoxici"
https://openalex.org/W2128085834,"Keratins K8 and K18 are the major components of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton of simple epithelia. Increased levels of these keratins have been associated with invasive growth and progression to malignancy in different types of human and murine epithelial tumors (including skin tumors), and even in tumors from nonepithelial origin. However, it has not yet clarified whether K8/K18 expression in tumors is cause or consequence of malignancy. Given the increasing incidence of epidermal cancer in humans (40% of all tumors diagnosed), we generated a mouse model to examine the role of simple epithelium keratins in the establishment and progression of human skin cancer. Transgenic mice expressing human K8 in the epidermis showed severe epidermal and hair follicle dysplasia with concomitant alteration in epidermal differentiation markers. The severity of the skin phenotype of these transgenic mice increases with age, leading to areas of preneoplastic transformation. Skin carcinogenesis assays showed a dramatic increase in the progression of papillomas toward malignancy in transgenic animals. These results support the idea that K8 alters the epidermal cell differentiation, favors the neoplastic transformation of cells, and is ultimately responsible of the invasive behavior of transformed epidermal cells leading of conversion of benign to malignant tumors."

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We report here that stimulation of NMDARs activates intracellular signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and facilitates clathrin-dependent endocytosis of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid subtype glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Both broad spectrum inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytotic processes and a specific inhibitor of AMPAR endocytosis selectively inhibit NMDA-induced apoptosis without affecting apoptosis produced by staurosporine. These results demonstrate that clathrin-dependent endocytosis of AMPARs is an essential step in NMDAR-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Our study not only identifies a previously unsuspected step in NMDA-induced apoptosis but also demonstrates that AMPAR endocytosis, in addition to attenuating synaptic strength as previously demonstrated in models of synaptic plasticity, may play a critical role in mediating other important intracellular pathways.

However, the mechanisms linking NMDAR activation to neuronal apoptosis remain unclear, although excessive calcium influx has been proposed as a primary underlying processes (1Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 3Yu S.P. Canzoniero L.M. Choi D.W. Curr. Opin.

Interestingly, several recent studies have indicated that NMDAR activation can also lead to significant facilitation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AMPARs, leading to long term depression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission (6Man H.Y. Ju W. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar). Given the evidence that endocytosis of EGF receptors, in addition to attenuating receptor activation on the plasma membrane, is essential to some signaling pathways mediated by EGF receptors (8Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), we set out to investigate whether the stimulated endocytosis of AMPARs constitutes an essential step in the signaling pathway leading to NMDA-induced neuronal apoptosis. Primary Culture of Hippocampal Neurons—Hippocampal cultures were prepared from embryonic E18 Sprague-Dawley rats and grown in culture medium (Neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement and 0.5 mm glutamine (Invitrogen)). The medium from mature 14-day in vitro neurons was removed and replaced with 100 μm NMDA plus 10 μm glycine in extracellular solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.35, 140 mm NaCl, 25 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, osmolarity: 310–320 mosm) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to restoring neurons to the culture medium. Twenty-four hours after NMDA/glycine application, neurons were processed using cell death assays. NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i responses were evoked and measured using methods described previously (9Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Assays—NMDA-induced apoptosis was quantified using either a Cell Death Detection Elisa Plus Kit (Roche Applied Sciences) or using TdT-mediated addition of biotinylated 11-dUTP to the free 3′-OH ends of DNA (Chemicon). Absorbance readings for both assays were determined using a spectrophotometric microplate reader. Data analysis and expression relative to appropriate controls were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for each kit. Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining of Nuclei—After the induction of apoptosis, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose for 10 min followed by ice-cold acetone for 1 min, and then stained with 20 mg/ml PI in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and viewed with a Leica fluorescence microscope to identify condensed nuclei. Cells with condensed nuclei were counted as apoptotic, and the percentage of apoptotic cells to the total number of cells was calculated to give a semiquantitative analysis, expressed as percentage of apoptosis. Peptide Treatments—Synthetic peptides, GluR23Y or GluR23A, were incubated with a carrier protein (Pep-1) (10Morris M.C. Depollier J. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) at a ratio of 1:20 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 30 min to allow the formation of GluR2/Pep-1 complexes. Hippocampal neurons (12–14 days in vitro) were then overlaid with the preformed complex to reach a final GluR2 peptide concentration of 1 μm and further incubated for 1 h before experiments commenced. ELISA Cell-surface Receptor Assay—Quantification of cell-surface AMPA or NMDARs was performed by a colorimetric cell-ELISA assay essentially as described previously (11Man H.Y. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), using monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domains of GluR2 or GluR1 or NR1 (Chemicon, 1 μg/ml). Data are expressed as absorbance measurement under non-permeabilized conditions/absorbance measurement under permeabilized conditions. Transferrin Receptor Endocytosis Assay—Hippocampal neurons were incubated with 2 mg/ml Alexa-A488-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of endocytosis inhibitors. Internalized receptors were then visualized with a Leica fluorescence microscope. NMDA treatment (100 μm plus 10 μm glycine, 1 h) induced a time-dependent increase in caspase-3 activity, a biochemical indicator of neuronal apoptosis (12Budd S.L. Tenneti L. Lishnak T. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6161-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), as detected by ELISA assay of DEVD-p-nitroanilide cleavage (Fig. 1A). The increase peaked 12–24 h after the treatment, at which time the majority of neurons were either dying or dead, exhibiting the hallmarks of apoptotic cell death, including DNA laddering as demonstrated by gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA (Fig. 1B), and nuclear condensation with disintegrating processes shown by nucleus staining with PI (Fig. 1C) or the intercalating DNA dye, Hoechst 33258 (bisbenzimide, data not shown). The degree of neuronal apoptosis was also quantified by measuring internucleosomal cleavage of DNA with both 11-dUTP (Fig. 1E) and histone biotinylation assays (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, the NMDA-induced apoptosis was a result of specific activation of NMDARs, as it was fully blocked by the NMDAR antagonist, APV (50 μm; Fig. 1D), but not inhibited by blocking AMPARs with DNQX (10 μm; Fig. 1D). Therefore, in accordance with previous reports (12Budd S.L. Tenneti L. Lishnak T. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6161-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), the NMDA treatment paradigm used in the present study produced neuronal apoptosis. To investigate the role of NMDA-induced endocytosis in mediating neuronal apoptosis, we first examined the effect of hypertonic sucrose, a well characterized inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis that prevents the assembly of clathrin-coated pits (11Man H.Y. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 13Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, sucrose treatment (400 mm) dramatically reduced NMDA-induced apoptosis. To more specifically target clathrin-dependent endocytosis, we employed a dynamin-derived, myristoylated peptide (myr-Dyn). This peptide is membrane-permeable and effectively inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis (14Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Ju W. Kalia L.V. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 2003; 422: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) by blocking the recruitment of dynamin to clathrin-coated pits by amphiphysin (16Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13419-13425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We found that myr-Dyn (10 μm) was as effective as hypertonic sucrose in reducing NMDA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1, E and F). In contrast, control Dyn peptides, both non-myristoylated (membrane-impermeable) Dyn (Dyn; Fig. 1E) and scrambled myr-Dyn (s-myr-Dyn; Fig. 1F), had little effect. To determine whether endocytosis is a general requirement for neuronal apoptosis, we next tested the effect of these inhibitors on a well characterized model of neuronal apoptosis induced by treating neurons with the kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (STS; 100 nm, 1 h) (12Budd S.L. Tenneti L. Lishnak T. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6161-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, both endocytosis inhibitors failed to significantly alter STS-induced neuronal apoptosis. These results demonstrate that a clathrin-dependent endocytotic process is necessary for NMDAR-mediated, but not STS-mediated, apoptosis. Ca2+ overload following NMDAR activation has been suspected as a primary causal factor leading to neuronal apoptosis (1Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 3Yu S.P. Canzoniero L.M. Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, as summarized in Fig. 2A, sucrose at concentrations that inhibited endocytosis and apoptosis did not significantly alter NMDA-evoked transient [Ca2+]i responses measured with the Ca2+ dye, Fura-2. The fact that inhibition of endocytosis blocked NMDA-induced apoptosis without affecting its [Ca2+]i responses strongly suggests that intracellular increases in Ca2+ concentrations, although necessary (3Yu S.P. Canzoniero L.M. Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), may not be sufficient to produce NMDA-induced apoptosis. Activation of certain forms of caspases, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 (17Okamoto S.S. Li Z. Ju C. Scholzke M.N. Mathews E. Cui J. Salvesen G.S. Bossy-Wetzel E. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 1A) has been implicated in NMDA-induced neuronal apoptosis. We therefore investigated the effects of inhibiting endocytosis on NMDA dependent activation of caspase-3. NMDA treatment dramatically increased the level of the activated form of caspase-3, as demonstrated by Western blots using an antibody that specifically recognizes activated/cleaved caspase-3, and this effect was efficiently inhibited by the membrane-permeable myr-Dyn (Fig. 2B). The serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB has previously been shown to be critically involved in protecting neurons from apoptotic cell death (18Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar), and inhibition of this kinase activity has previously been suspected of being involved in NMDAR-mediated apoptosis (19Chalecka-Franaszek E. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8745-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the endocytosis process plays a critical role in the inhibition of Akt activity by determining the level of Akt phosphorylation at serine 473, a residue whose phosphorylation is required for full activation of Akt (20Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, treatment of neurons with NMDA resulted in a significant reduction in Ser473-phosphorylated Akt and hence Akt activity without altering the levels of total Akt. This reduction in Akt activity was largely prevented by the inhibition of endocytosis with hypertonic sucrose. In striking contrast, sucrose treatment had no effect on the reduction of Akt phosphorylation following STS treatment (Fig. 2C). Thus, stimulated endocytosis appears to be an obligatory step that is downstream of rising [Ca2+]i and upstream of caspase activation and Akt inhibition in NMDA-induced neuronal apoptosis. Several recent studies in the synaptic plasticity field have demonstrated that NMDAR activation can selectively stimulate the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AMPARs (6Man H.Y. Ju W. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1526-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Malinow R. Malenka R.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 21Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat.

Carroll R.C. Yu X. Morishita W. Yasuda H. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous studies, we observed a significant reduction of cell-surface AMPA, but not NMDA, receptors following the NMDA paradigm used here. Since the reduction in AMPARs was observed by measuring cell-surface expression of both the GluR2 subunit (Fig. 3, A and B) and the GluR1 subunit (64 ± 2 and 51 ± 1% of the total receptors on the cell surface for control and NMDA-treated neurons, respectively; n = 5, p < 0.001), it appears to be a decrease in total cell-surface AMPARs and not a replacement of GluR2-containing with GluR2-lacking receptors as a result of GluR2-dependent endocytosis. The AMPAR reduction was blocked by the endocytosis inhibitor myr-Dyn but not the control peptide, Dyn (Fig. 3A), indicating the involvement of facilitated clathrin-dependent endocytosis. We have demonstrated previously that stimulated AMPAR endocytosis requires the GluR2 subunit (11Man H.Y. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), more specifically the short amino acid sequence between residues tyrosine 869 and glutamic acid 879 within the carboxyl-terminal region (21Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 24Ahmadian G. Ju W. Liu L. Wyszynski M. Lee S.H. Dunah A.W. Taghibiglou C. Wang Y. Lu J. Wong T.P. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have therefore reasoned that a short peptide, which comprises the required sequence YKEGYNVYGIE (termed GluR23Y), may function as a dominant inhibitor of NMDAR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis (24Ahmadian G. Ju W. Liu L. Wyszynski M. Lee S.H. Dunah A.W. Taghibiglou C. Wang Y. Lu J. Wong T.P. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As predicted, when the GluR23Y peptide (1 μm) was delivered into cultured neurons by mixing it with a carrier peptide (Pep-1) (10Morris M.C. Depollier J. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) 1 h prior to and during the NMDA treatment, the NMDA-induced reduction of cell-surface AMPARs was completely prevented (Fig. 3B). To be sure that the blockade by this peptide was not due to nonspecific effects on the endocytotic process, we examined its effect on transferrin receptor endocytosis, a well characterized clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis (13Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, internalization of fluorescently labeled transferrin as a result of transferrin receptor endocytosis was eliminated by hypertonic sucrose, but not by GluR23Y + Pep-1, applied to these neurons 1 h prior to and during the transferrin incubation. Thus, GluR23Y does not indiscriminately affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis. If NMDA-induced apoptosis requires AMPAR endocytosis, one would expect that the GluR23Y peptide should be effective in preventing NMDA-induced apoptosis. Consistent with our prediction, GluR23Y plus Pep-1 significantly reduced NMDA-induced apoptosis as quantified by the histone biotinylation assay (Fig. 4A), and by PI nuclear staining (Fig. 4, B and C). Neither GluR23Y nor Pep-1 alone nor Pep-1 plus the control peptide GluR23A (in which the three tyrosine residues were replaced with alanines (24Ahmadian G. Ju W. Liu L. Wyszynski M. Lee S.H. Dunah A.W. Taghibiglou C. Wang Y. Lu J. Wong T.P. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1040-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)) had any detectable effect on NMDA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Similar to the general blockade of the clathrin-mediated endocytotic process with either sucrose or myr-Dyn, interference with AMPAR endocytosis by GluR23Y did not alter STS-induced neuronal apoptosis (Fig. 4B). Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for an obligatory requirement for AMPAR endocytosis in mediating NMDA-induced neuronal apoptosis. In the present study we have found that clathrin-dependent AMPAR endocytosis is specifically required for NMDA-induced, but not STS-induced, apoptosis of hippocampal neurons maintained in primary culture. Blocking endocytosis has no effect on NMDA-induced Ca2+ responses but prevents both NMDA-induced activation of caspase-3 and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. Since AMPAR endocytosis is known to be an intracellular Ca2+-dependent process (11Man H.Y. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 21Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), it is likely that Ca2+ influx through NMDARs may function as a trigger leading to the facilitation of AMPAR endocytosis, which may in turn initiate a cascade causing neuronal apoptosis. Thus, the present study has identified AMPAR endocytosis as a critical link between NMDA-induced Ca2+i overload and intracellular cascades leading to apoptosis. A large body of evidence accumulated recently has established a central role for stimulated clathrin-dependent AMPAR endocytosis in reducing receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, contributing to the expression of certain forms of well characterized synaptic plasticity including long term depression in both hippocampus (11Man H.Y.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The requirement for AMPAR endocytosis in NMDA-induced apoptosis demonstrated in the present study further suggests that, in addition to the decrease in receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, endocytosed AMPARs also play previously unsuspected roles in intracellular signaling pathways. The mediation of NMDA-induced apoptosis is one example. The detailed mechanisms by which endocytosed AMPARs contribute to the initiation of downstream apoptotic cascades remain to be determined. However, analogous to the recently reported retinal cell apoptosis induced following stimulated endocytosis of rhodopsin (27Kiselev A. Socolich M. Vinos J. Hardy R.W. Zuker C.S. Ranganathan R. Neuron. 2000; 28: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 28Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and activation of EGF receptor-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling by endocytosed EGF receptors (8Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), it is possible that endocytosed AMPARs, in response to NMDA stimulation, may form, with some of the clathrin-coat protein components, a signaling complex that initiates the apoptotic cascade. Nevertheless, the present study provides the first evidence for the involvement of stimulated AMPAR endocytosis in NMDA-induced neuronal apoptosis, thereby unveiling a novel pathway in mediating cell apoptosis. NMDAR-mediated apoptosis is one of the primary causes leading to the selective loss of neurons in both neurodegenerative diseases and acute brain insults, and clathrin-dependent AMPAR endocytosis is a fundamental process in the control of efficacy of synaptic transmission at glutamatergic synapses. By linking the endocytosis of AMPARs to neuronal apoptosis, our study suggests the components of the AMPAR endocytotic pathway may be novel therapeutic targets for the development of a new generation of neuroprotective agents.

https://openalex.org/W2086573320,"In the present study, we used the N terminus (amino acids 1∼160) of type VI adenylyl cyclase (ACVI) as bait to screen a mouse brain cDNA library and identified Snapin as a novel ACVI-interacting molecule. Snapin is a binding protein of SNAP25, a component of the SNARE complex. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed the interaction between Snapin and full-length ACVI. Mutational analysis revealed that the interaction domains of ACVI and Snapin were located within amino acids 1∼86 of ACVI and 33–51 of Snapin, respectively. Co-localization of ACVI and Snapin was observed in primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, expression of Snapin specifically eliminated protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated suppression of ACVI, but not that of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or calcium. Mutation of the potential PKC and PKA phosphorylation sites of Snapin did not affect the ability of Snapin to reverse the PKC inhibitory effect on ACVI. Phosphorylation of Snapin by PKC or PKA therefore might not be crucial for Snapin action on ACVI. In contrast, SnapinΔ33–51, which harbors an internal deletion of amino acids 33–51 did not affect PKC-mediated inhibition of ACVI, supporting that amino acids 33–51 of Snapin comprises the ACVI-interacting region. Consistently, Snapin exerted no effect on PKC-mediated inhibition of an ACVI mutant (ACVI-ΔA87), which lacked the Snapin-interacting region (amino acids 1–86). Snapin thus reverses its action via direct interaction with the N terminus of ACVI. Collectively, we demonstrate herein that in addition to its association with the SNARE complex, Snapin also functions as a regulator of an important cAMP synthesis enzyme in the brain.

Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester; ACVI, type VI adenylyl cyclase; DIV, days in vitro; MBP, maltose-binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MBS, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester; ACVI, type VI adenylyl cyclase; DIV, days in vitro; MBP, maltose-binding protein. are a family of enzymes that produce cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP upon extracellular stimulation. To date, at least 9 membrane-bound ACs have been isolated and characterized (1Chern Y. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These enzymes are capable of integrating positive and negative signals that act directly through stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or indirectly via intracellular signaling molecules in isozyme-specific patterns. In addition, the regulatory properties and expression patterns of different AC isoforms greatly diverge and may account for the distinctive cell- and tissue-specific responsiveness of ACs. Recently, several different proteins, including RGS2 and the protein associated with Myc (PAM), have been shown to interact and modulate activity of different AC isozymes (2Scholich K. Pierre S. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47583-57489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Salim S. Sinnarajah S. Kehrl J.H. Dessauer C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15842-15849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), adding additional dimensions to the isozyme-specific regulation of the AC superfamily. Except for the newly identified soluble AC, all membrane-bound AC members share a primary structure consisting of 12 transmembrane regions and 3 large cytoplasmic domains (N, C1a/b, and C2). The C1a and C2 domains, which form the catalytic core complex, are highly conserved and are homologous to each other. The N-terminal domains of ACs, in contrast, are variable among ACs, and have been demonstrated to play mostly regulatory roles (4Gu C. Cooper D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among the AC isozymes, ACVI is of particular interest, because this enzyme can be suppressed by several intracellular signaling molecules including Ca2+, cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC) (6Mons N. Cooper D.M. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1994; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Chen Y. Harry A. Li J. Smit M.J. Bai X. Magnusson R. Pieroni J.P. Weng G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although ACVI has been found in many tissues examined (9Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), its expression in the brain is mainly detected in neurons (10Liu F.C. Wu G.C. Hsieh S.T. Lai H.L. Wang H.F. Wang T.W. Chern Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ACVI therefore might play a critical role in integrating multiple signal inputs in neurons. We previously demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of ACVI (designated N1–160) is critical for PKC-mediated suppression of ACVI (5Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Using N1–160 as the bait to screen a mouse brain cDNA library, we report herein that Snapin is a novel ACVI-interacting protein. Snapin has been found on synaptic vesicle membranes and was originally identified as a novel binding protein of SNAP-25, a plasmalemmal component of SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attached protein receptors) (11Hilfiker S. Greengard P. Augustine G.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Assembly of the SNAREs complex is the key step for docking and fusion between vesicles and target membranes. Snapin was found to modulate neurotransmitter release by enhancing the interaction between the SNAREs complex and synaptotagmin, a putative calcium sensor, through direct interaction with SNAP-25 (12Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, Snapin is a physiological PKA substrate and can modulate neurotransmitter secretion by the cAMP-dependent pathway (13Chheda M.G. Ashery U. Thakur P. Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Shih Y.P. Kung W.M. Chen J.C. Yeh C.H. Wang A.H. Wang T.F. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Similar to the expression profile of Snapin in the brain, we previously demonstrated that ACVI is widely expressed in many brain regions (10Liu F.C. Wu G.C. Hsieh S.T. Lai H.L. Wang H.F. Wang T.W. Chern Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Double immunostaining of ACVI and Snapin shown in the present study reveals the colocalization of ACVI and Snapin in the brain and in primary hippocampal neurons, supporting the physiological relevance of this interaction. Most importantly, PKC loses its ability to suppress ACVI activity in the presence of Snapin. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, a fine-tuning mechanism for the cAMP production system by the vesicle-transporting machinery in the brain. Materials—Forskolin, cAMP, ATP, prostaglandin E1, thapsigargin, and essential amino acids were obtained from Sigma. Purified PKA, thapsigargin, and PKC were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). CellTracker™ CM-DiI was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). MgCl2 and other chemicals were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) unless stated otherwise. Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments and Library Screening—The cDNA of rat ACVI (9Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. R. Iyengar (Department of Pharmacology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal domain of ACVI (amino acids 1∼160, N1–160) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; see Supplemental Materials, Table S-1), subcloned into the pAS2-1 vector, and served as the bait to screen a mouse brain cDNA library using the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The identified cDNA clones were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing and functional annotation using standard bioinformatic programs. Plasmid Construction—A 0.75-kb BglII fragment of pACT2-Snapin, which contained the entire coding region of Snapin was ligated into the EcoRI site of a pcDNA3 vector (Clontech) resulting in pcDNA3-Snapin. DNA fragments encoding various truncation fragments of N1–160 or Snapin were amplified by PCR using the primers listed under “Supplemental Materials” (Table S-1), and subcloned either into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-11d (Novagen, Madison, WI, pET-11d-N1–160, pET-11d-N1–86, pET-11d-N1–123, pET-11d-Snapin26–136, and pET-11d-Snapin51–136), into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pMAL-C2xC (pMAL-Snapin; 14) using standard molecular biology methods, or into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using a TA expression kit (Invitrogen; pcDNA3.1-Snapin1–95, pcDNA3.1-Snapin1–115). The Snapin-Δ33–51 mutant, Snapin-S50A, and Snapin-T-117A were created by a two-step PCR technique as described previously (Ref. 5Lai H.L. Lin T.H. Kao Y.Y. Lin W.J. Hwang M.J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Table S-1) with pcDNA3-Snapin as the DNA template. The resultant DNA fragments were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector. In Vitro Binding—Recombinant N1–160, N1–123, N1–86, and Snapin variants were produced in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) using the TnT® quick-coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. An in vitro binding assay was performed by incubating the reaction mixture containing [35S]methionine-labeled recombinant proteins (25∼60 fmol) at 30 °C for 1 h, followed by addition of 30 μl of the AC6N antibody (10Liu F.C. Wu G.C. Hsieh S.T. Lai H.L. Wang H.F. Wang T.W. Chern Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)-protein A complex (Sigma) and incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. The immunocomplexes were purified, extensively washed, and resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar). Detection of 35S-labeled proteins was enhanced by incubating the fixed gels in EN3HANCE (NEN™ Life Science Products, Zaventem, Belgium) for 30 min. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Recombinant MBP and MBP-Snapin proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified using Amylose resin (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol. For the interaction between MBP-Snapin and N1–160, recombinant MBP Snapin (2.5 μg) or MBP (10 μg) was first bound to amylose resin (30 μl) and then incubated with the TnT lysates containing [35S]methionine-labeled N1–160 proteins (0.003 pmol) in 400 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 30 °C. The complexes bound on the amylose resins were extensively washed with binding buffer and analyzed using 15% SDS-PAGE gels. The halves of gels that contained proteins larger than 35 kDa were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the levels of MBP-Snapin and MBP were analyzed by the Western blot analysis using anti-MBP antiserum (New England BioLabs; 1: 10,000 dilution) and anti-SNA-c (1:5,000 dilution), respectively. The other halves of the gels, which contained proteins smaller than 35 kDa were fixed and autoradiographed as described above. Note that an excess amount of MBP was used as a negative control to ensure the specificity of the binding between MBP-Snapin and N1–160. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat brains at embryonic day 18∼19 as described elsewhere (16Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar) and grown in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen Life Technologies). At 8∼9 days in vitro (DIV), cultures were washed twice with KRH buffer (125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5.6 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), and then treated with KRH buffer or KRH buffer containing 56 mm KCl (Hi-K+) for 5 min at room temperature. At the end of stimulation, cells were immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose for 20 min, and then were ready for double or triple label immunostaining. The CHOP cell line (17Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. J. W. Dennis (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) in 10% CO2 and 90% air. For transient transfection experiments, CHOP cells were transfected with the desired construct using the DEAE-dextran method (18Wong Y.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection for analysis. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in an incubation chamber supplied with 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. HEK239T cells were transfected with the desired construct(s) at 3 × 106 cells in 100-mm culture plates using LipofectAMINE 2000™ as described above. Production and Biotinylation of the Polyclonal Anti-Snapin Antibody—The oligopeptide (S118–136, CARRRAMLDSGVYPPGSPSK, corresponding to amino acids 118∼136 of mouse Snapin) was purchased from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) and conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) using m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS) as described by Harlow et al. (19Harlow E. Land D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antiserum was generated by injecting male New Zealand White rabbits with the BSA-conjugated peptide using standard procedures (19Harlow E. Land D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The resultant antibody was designated SNA-c. To remove the potentially existing anti-BSA IgG, SNA-c antiserum was preabsorbed with 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. To characterize the specificity of SNA-c, the antigen peptide was conjugated to an irrelevant protein, ovalbumin, using MBS as described above and used for competition experiments. The addition of an excess amount of the peptide antigen (S118–136) conjugated to an irrelevant protein (ovalbumin; 1 mg/ml) completely abolished the immunoreactivity of Snapin in the brain and caused the disappearance of an immunoreactive band of 15 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of Snapin, in the plasma membrane fractions of the rat hippocampus (Fig. S-1; Supplemental Materials). For double immunohistochemical staining, the SNA-c antibody was biotinylated. Briefly, the SNA-c antibody was first purified by a protein A-Sephadex column, and then incubated with NHS-LC-Biotin (3 mg/ml; Pierce) at a 1:15 molar ratio. Immunohistochemical staining of the rat brain using the biotinylated SNA-c antibody exhibited an identical expression profile of Snapin as that by the original SNA-c antiserum in rat brain (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Expressions of wild-type and mutant ACVI were carried out in a recombinant baculovirus-driven Sf21 cell system following the manufacturer's protocol (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) as described elsewhere (8Lai H.L. Yang T.H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.H. Lin S.C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). ACVI proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation with an anti-ACVI antibody (AC6D) as described previously (8Lai H.L. Yang T.H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.H. Lin S.C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane fractions (0.3 mg) collected from Sf21 cells infected with the desired ACVI virus were solubilized with 0.25 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm leupeptin) at 4 °C for 2 h, and then incubated with 50 μl of the AC6D/protein A complex or the antigen-pre-absorbed AC6D/protein A complex at 4 °C for 90 min with gentle agitation. After extensive washing, enriched ACVI proteins were mixed with [35S]Snapin (0.005 pmol) in 50 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm leupeptin) at 30 °C for 1 h to allow complex formation. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 8% separating gels. The half of gels that contained proteins larger than 50 kDa were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and utilized to determine the expression of ACVI using AC6D (1:5000 dilution; 8). The other half of the gels, which contained proteins smaller than 50 kDa, were fixed, enhanced using En3HANCE, and autoradiographed as described above. Immunohistochemistry—Double immunostaining of ACVI and Snapin was conducted as detailed elsewhere (20Lee Y.-C. Chien C.-L. Sun C.-N. Chiang M.-C. Huang C.-L. Huang N.-K. Lai H.-L. Lin Y.-S. Chiou S.-Y. Liao W.-L. Liu F.-C. Wang L. Tai M.-H. Lin T.-N. Chern Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, fixed cells were first stained with a polyclonal rabbit anti-ACVI antibody (AC6N, 1:1000; 10) followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:400), blocked using the avidin D blocking solution (6 μl/ml, avidin/biotin blocking kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min and the biotin blocking solution (6 μl/ml, avidin/biotin blocking kit) for 30 min, and then incubated with the biotinylated SNA-c antibody (1:150), followed by staining with streptavidin conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 568 (1:1000). For triple immunostaining with ACVI, Snapin, and MAP2 in primary hippocampal neurons, cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, stained with a monoclonal anti-MAP2 antibody (1: 1000, Chemicon, Temecula CA) at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated in a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy5 (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 2 h. After extensive rinsing, staining of ACVI, and Snapin was carried out as described above. For the triple immunostaining with ACVI, Snapin, and DiI, staining with ACVI and Snapin was carried out as described above. Cells were then stained with DiI (10 ng/μl) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, followed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess DiI. Patterns of double or triple immunostaining were analyzed with the aid of a laser confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, MRC-1000). Controls for the specificity of immunofluorescence were determined by omission of the primary antibody from the staining process. AC Assay and cAMP Measurement—AC activity was assayed as previously described (21Chern Y. Lai H.L. Fong J.C. Liang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 950-958PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was linear for up to 30 min with up to 40 μg of membrane protein. The ACVI activity was determined as the difference between cyclase activities measured in the membrane fractions collected from CHOP cells transfected with the indicated ACVI expression construct and those from cells transfected with the empty vector alone. For CHOP cells expressing wild-type ACVI, endogenous cyclase activities represented ∼40% of the total activity. The absolute values of ACVI activity observed in different transient transfection experiments might have slightly varied due to the number of passages and condition of cells. Nevertheless, the overall pattern of AC regulation was consistent among experiments. Intracellular cAMP content was determined as described before (21Chern Y. Lai H.L. Fong J.C. Liang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 950-958PubMed Google Scholar, 22Brooker G. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. Cells were washed twice with the Ca2+-free Locke's solution (150 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm IBMX and resuspended in the same solution at 1 × 105 cells/0.45 ml in each 1.5-ml tube. The effect of calcium on ACVI activities was determined as reported elsewhere (23Cooper D.M. Yoshimura M. Zhang Y. Chiono M. Mahey R. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed once with calcium-free Locke's solution and pretreated with thapsigargin (1 μm) for 3 min, followed by EGTA (2.5 mm) for 7 min, then stimulated with calcium-free Locke's solution containing forskolin (10 μm) plus prostaglandin E1 (10 μm) for 10 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of CaCl2 (10 mm). Cellular cAMP was extracted by adding 0.3 ml of 0.1 n HCl to each tube with gentle mixing for 10 min on ice. The cAMP content was assayed using the 125I-cAMP assay system (Amersham Biosciences). cAMP accumulation resulting from activation of ACVI was determined as the difference between cAMP levels measured in HEK293T cells expressing wild-type ACVI versus an empty vector (pCEP4). Snapin Interaction with the N-terminal Domain of ACVI— Although the N terminus is variable among different AC members, it is highly conserved between species. The N terminus therefore might mediate developmentally conserved regulatory modes of ACVI. Compared with other members in the AC superfamily, the N terminus of ACVI with 160 amino acids is relatively large and might mediate its functions through interacting with other proteins. To search for proteins that interact with the N-terminal domain of rat ACVI (designated N1–160) in the brain, we used N1–160 as the bait to screen a mouse brain cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. This library was chosen because of its availability and because the N termini of rat and mouse ACVI are highly homologous (96% identify in amino acids). Out of 2 × 105 clones, 2 independent clones encoding a full-length and a partial fragment (amino acids 33∼136, designated SNP33–136) of Snapin were identified. Note that the amino acid sequences of mouse and rat Snapin are identical. Such an interaction was verified by co-transforming the identified pACT2-Snapin construct (full-length or the truncated Snapin33–136) with the original N1–160 bait into yeast Y187 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, co-transformation of the Snapin variant and N1–160 led to expression of the reporter gene (β-galactosidase), confirming the interaction between Snapin and N1–160 in yeast. In vitro binding of the recombinant N1–160 and Snapin was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation using an anti-ACVI antibody (AC6N). As expected, Snapin, but not an unrelated UORF5 protein, was co-immunoprecipitated with N1–160 (Fig. 1B). This interaction between N1–160 and Snapin was specific because in the absence of N1–160, no Snapin was detected in the immunoprecipitated complex (Fig. 1B). Moreover, full-length ACVI prepared from Sf21 cells also bound Snapin (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that ACVI interacts with Snapin through direct interaction at its N-terminal domain. To define the Snapin-interacting site of N1–160, we performed in vitro binding analyses of the recombinant Snapin and various lengths of the N-terminal domain of ACVI (Fig. 2A). Recombinant proteins were produced using the in vitro TnT system in the presence of [35S]methionine. Complex formation was identified by immunoprecipitation using antiserum (AC6N) against N1–160. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, the fragment comprising amino acids 1–86 (N1–86) was effectively co-immunoprecipitated with the recombinant Snapin as were the full-length N terminus (N1–160) and N1–123. The Snapin-interacting region of N1–160 therefore might reside in the region containing amino acids 1∼86. We next performed experiments to determine what portion on Snapin N1–160 was bound using the in vitro binding assay as described above. Five recombinant proteins comprising different portions of mouse Snapin (amino acids 26∼136, 33∼136, 51∼136, 1∼95, and 1∼115, designated SNP26–136, SNP33–136, SNP51–136, SNP1–95, and SNP1–115, respectively; Fig. 2B) were prepared in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, N1–160 immunoprecipitated all of the Snapin variants examined, except for SNP51–136. Since SNP33–136 retained the ability to interact with N1–160, amino acids 33∼51 of Snapin appeared to be crucial for the interaction with N1–160. Furthermore, addition of a synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 33∼51 of Snapin (designated S33–51) abated the interaction between Snapin and N1–160 (Fig. 2, D and E), confirming that the interactive domain of Snapin with N1–160 resides in the region containing amino acids 33∼51 of Snapin. The peptide containing amino acids 118∼136 of Snapin (designated S118–136) did not exert a significant effect on the binding of Snapin to N1–160 and thus served as a control peptide in this experiment (Fig. 2, D and E). Collectively, the ACVI-binding region of Snapin is located within amino acids 33∼51, a region different from that which was used to interact with SNAP25 (12Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or SNAP23 (24Buxton P. Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Colocalization of ACVI and Snapin—We previously demonstrated that in the brain, ACVI is expressed in most areas examined and is present in cells with a neuronal phenotype (10Liu F.C. Wu G.C. Hsieh S.T. Lai H.L. Wang H.F. Wang T.W. Chern Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since the regional expression of Snapin in the central nervous system (CNS) has not yet been reported, we first set out to examine the expression of Snapin in the brain. Detailed analysis revealed that similar to the expression of ACVI in the brain, Snapin was widely expressed in many brain areas with different intensities (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S-1B-G). Double immunohistochemical staining further demonstrated that ACVI was colocalized with Snapin in the adult rat brain (Supplemental Materials, Fig. S-1H-M), and in primary hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3). Importantly, depolarization of these hippocampal neurons by external high K+ (56 mm, 5 min) did not alter the colocalization of ACVI and Snapin (Fig. 3, D–N), which could readily be observed in somas and proximal dendrites. Consistently, in vitro binding of ACVI and Snapin determined by co-immunoprecipitation could be observed both in the absence (Fig. 1C), and presence of calcium (data not shown). Interactions between ACVI and Snapin therefore appeared to be independent of the neuron's activity. The ACVI and Snapin comp"

As antigen-presenting cells (APC) are of crucial importance for the regulation of immunity, in this study we wanted to define the role of platelet factor 4 (PF-4) as one of the major platelet-derived chemokines on the transition of monocytes into APCs. Our experiments show that within 3 days PF-4 in conjunction with IL-4 induces a rapid differentiation of monocytes into APC. These PFAPC (PF-4/IL-4 differentiated APC) display unique phenotypical and functional characteristics setting them apart from macrophages and conventional dendritic cells. Functional studies revealed that PFAPC preferentially stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes and lytic NK activity while they induced only moderate cytokine responses. Beyond day 3 of differentiation, PFAPC became less immunostimulatory and maintained their capacity to phagocytose particulate material even after LPS-induced maturation. These experiments uncover a previously unknown role for the platelet-derived CXC-chemokine PF-4 in differentiation of human APC. Our data further support the newly discovered function of platelets in immunomodulation and provide new evidence for a rapid transition of monocytes into APC under the influence of inflammatory stimuli."

Here we discovered three new conserved regulators of eIF2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. cdc123, homolog of mammalian D123, is a new cell division cycle mutant with a G2 delay at permissive temperature and a terminal, mating-proficient G1 arrest point. Cdc123 protein is regulated by nutrient availability. CHF1 and CHF2, homologs of mammalian checkpoint forkhead associated with RING genes, are required for G2 delay and G1 arrest of cdc123-4 and promote G1 delay when over-expressed. Cell cycle delaying activity and the natural instability of Chf1 and Chf2 depend on the integrity of both domains and association with Cdc123. Genetic analysis maps the Chf1 forkhead associated domain-binding site to the conserved Thr-274 of Cdc123, suggesting that mammalian D123 is a key target of Chfr.

Loss of cdc123 activity promotes Chf1 and Chf2 accumulation and Gcd11 depletion, accounting for the essentiality of Cdc123.

Although nutrient limitation arrests yeast cells in early G1 prior to a great deal of protein synthesis and pheromone treatment arrests haploids at late G1, many of the connections between nutritional signaling and pheromone signaling and the potential for specific translational requirements in late G1 remain to be explored. In this study we discover a new conserved cdc gene that is nutritionally regulated at the protein level whose mutants arrest, like cdc28 mutants, as large unbudded cells at the pheromone-sensitive stage in late G1. In addition, reminiscent of many cdc28 alleles and like cdc2 mutants in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and other systems, cdc123-4 mutants have a G2 delay phenotype in addition to a G1 block. We show that Cdc123 protein (GenBank™ accession number BK005577) is depleted in nutritionally arrested cells but present in dividing cells and in pheromone-treated cells and that it functions to reduce the level of Chf1 and Chf2 (GenBank™ accession numbers BK005578 and BK005579). Chf1 and Chf2 are the two yeast homologs of the human checkpoint forkhead associated (FHA) 1The abbreviations used are: FHA, forkhead associated; Chfr, checkpoint forkhead associated with RING; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase enzyme 3; HA, hemagglutinin; eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2. with RING (Chfr) protein, which is required for G2 arrest in response to microtubule-destabilizing agents (15Scolnick D.M.

Our study provides a fine genetic mapping of the interaction between the FHA domain of Chf1 and the conserved Thr-274 of Cdc123 and shows that this interaction is required for cell cycle delay by Chf1 and RING-dependent destruction of the checkpoint proteins themselves. This result is interesting not only in identification of a specific functional target of the Chfr-homologous FHA domain but also because the finding runs counter to the expectation that a RING protein bound to a phosphoprotein would tag the phosphoprotein for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Because deletion of chf1 and chf2 relieved the G2 cell cycle delay and G1 cell cycle block but not the essential function of cdc123, we looked for an essential target of Cdc123 regulation and discovered that Gcd11 (22Harashima S.

The data indicate that mating-proficient arrest of cdc123 is achieved by Chf-dependent alteration of eIF2γ abundance, thus connecting the nutritional and pheromone control of START with regulation of translational initiation. Plasmid Constructions—New plasmids are summarized Table I. All plasmids were made by cloning PCR products using restriction sites incorporated into the primer sequences indicated in Table II. Yeast genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR unless stated otherwise. The yeast CDC123 (YLR215C) gene was amplified with primers 4952 and 4953. The DNA fragment obtained in this reaction was cloned into vector pRS414 to create plasmid pB119. Plasmid pB121 was obtained by cloning of the BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pB119 into vector pRS416. The NdeI site was created in the pB119 plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis using primer 4960. This restriction site was used to insert a linker obtained by annealing and ligating oligonucleotides 5112 and 5113 to generate plasmid pB179 that expresses a 3xFLAG-Cdc123 fusion protein. Human D123 coding sequences were amplified from cDNA made from HeLa cells with primers 5106 and 5107. Plasmid pB174 was made by cloning of this PCR product into BamHI and XhoI sites of the p425GAL1 vector. Plasmid pB319 was obtained by cloning the CDC123 gene from pB179 into vector pRS416. C-terminal HA-tagged alleles of CHF1 and CHF2 were made by PCR with primers 7055 and 7236 (CHF1) or 7009 and 7235 (CHF2). The products of the yeast genomic DNA amplification with these pairs of primers were cloned into vector p425GAL1, and the resulting plasmids were named pB313 and pB312, respectively. These plasmids were used to create RING domain mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pB312 and mutagenic primer 7129 were used to create plasmid pB332 that carries the CHF2 gene with two point mutations, C451S and H456A. Plasmid pB333, containing a chf1-C345S, H350A allele, was obtained by mutagenesis of the pB313 plasmid with mutagenic primer 7128. Primers 7055 and 7008 were used to amplify the CHF1 gene, which was then cloned into p425GAL1 to generate plasmid pB299. pB299 was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using primer 7128 that resulted in plasmid pB331, carrying chf1-C345S, H350A. Plasmid pB323 contains the CHF2 gene cloned as a PCR product obtained with primers 7003 and 7005 in vector p425GAL1. This plasmid and primer 7129 were used to generate plasmid pB334 containing the chf2-C451S, H456A allele. The G192E substitution in the FHA domain of CHF1 was generated from plasmids pB299 and pB313 with primer 7110 resulting in plasmids pB403 and pB405. Plasmids pB404 and pB406, containing the chf1-S220A, H223L allele, were obtained by mutagenesis of plasmids pB299 and pB313 with primer 7111. chf1 alleles were amplified from plasmids pB331, pB403, and pB404 by PCR with primers 7008 and 7010, and the products of these reactions were cloned into plasmid pACT2 and named pB396, pB408, and pB409, respectively. Plasmid pB310 was obtained by cloning of the PCR fragment generated with primers 7008 and 7010, containing wild-type CHF1, into the pACT2 vector. To make plasmid pB271, CDC123 was amplified with primers 7073 and 7074 and cloned into vector pOBD22. Plasmid pB424 carrying the 3XFLAG-cdc123-T274A allele was made using mutagenic primer 7303 and single-stranded DNA obtained from plasmid pB179. The tag-free cdc123 allele of plasmid pB424 was amplified with primers 7073 and 7074 and cloned into plasmid pOBD22. This plasmid was named pB426 and was used for two-hybrid assays. The HA-tagged allele of GCD11 was created by two-step PCR. In the first step, the fragment of yeast genomic DNA was amplified with primers 7796 and 7797. The product of this reaction was re-amplified with primers 7796 and 7798 and cloned between SacI and XhoI sites of plasmid pRS416. The resulting plasmid, pB463, contains the GCD11 promoter controlling expression of GCD11 with two C-terminal HA epitopes. To create plasmid pB232, the GCD11 open reading frame was amplified using primers 7830 and 7831. The product of this reaction was cloned in plasmid p425GAL1 using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites incorporated in the primers. Plasmid pB295 carrying the CDC123 gene under GAL1 promoter control was created by cloning the PCR product generated with primers 7832 and 7833 between BamHI and XhoI sites of plasmid p425GAL1. Plasmid pB350 was made by replacing the GAL1 promoter in plasmid pB313 with the CHF1 promoter amplified with primers 7045 and 7046. Replacement of the GAL1 promoter in plasmid pB312 with the PCR product generated in a reaction with primers 7047 and 7048 yielded plasmid pB351 that contains the CHF2 gene controlled by its native promoter.Table IPlasmids generated in this studyNameCloned geneVectorpB119CDC123pRS414pB121CDC123pRS416pB174HumanD123 cDNAp425GAL1pB1793xFLAG-CDC123pRS414pB232GCD11p425GAL1pB271CDC123pOBD22pB295CDC123p425GAL1pB299CHF1p425GAL1pB310CHF1pACT2pB3113xFLAG-CDC123pRS415pB312CHF2-2xHAp425GAL1pB313CHF1-2xHAp425GAL1pB3193xFLAG-CDC123pRS416pB323CHF2p425GAL1pB331chf1-C345S, H350Ap425GAL1pB332chf2-C451S, H456A, 2xHAp425GAL1pB333chf1-C345S, H350A, 2xHAp425GAL1pB334chf2-C451S, H456Ap425GAL1pB350CHF1-2xHApRS425pB351CHF2-2xHApRS425pB396chf1-C345S, H350ApACT2pB403chf1-G192Ep425GAL1pB404chf1-S220A, H223Lp425GAL1pB405chf1-G192E, 2xHAp425GAL1pB406chf1-S220A, H223L, 2xHAp425GAL1pB408chf1-G192EpACT2pB409chf1-S220A, H223LpACT2pB4243xFLAG-cdc123-T274ApRS414pB426cdc123-T274ApOBD22pB463GCD11-2xHApRS416pB464cdc123-4pRS414 Open table in a new tab Table IIOligonucleotides used in this study (5′ to 3′)4948CCATTTATGCAGTGGGAAGATTAAGAAGCTAATGATACCGTAACTCCACCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC4949GCGGATATTTTCGATGTCC4950ATACAACAGGGTAATAAAAAGACGAATATATTCAAATGCGGGTTCTAAATCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCGC4951CTCTTCCTTGAAGATTGACG4952GATCGGATCCTTACCTGACGATTATCAAGTG4953CTAGGAATTCTTGACGTTGAACTAGAAGAAG4958CAGTTGACACATATGAAGAAGGAGCATGTGCTTCACTGC4959CACAGTGTCGACTCAGTCGTCCTCCTGCTGATTTCTC4960GACATAAATTACTTACATATGTTCTCACAAGAA5088AGATCTCGGATCCAGCCAAATGACGCTG5089CCTTGTTAAGAATTCTTGCACGCATAC5106GGTCATCGCGGATCCATGAAGAAGGAGCATGTGC5107CCAGTACCGCTCGAGTCAGTCGTCCTCCTGCTG5112TATGGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGGC5113TAGGCCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGATGTCATGATCTTTATAATCACCGTCATGGTCTTTGTAGTCCA7002GACTGAATTCTCCCTTGCCCCAGTGTACAC7003CAGTCTCGAGTTAAGGATGGCTATCAACATCC7004ACGAGTTCAATTCTAAGTTACAGAGATGTGAC7005GACTGAATTCATGCCTATATGATTATGTATCG7006GCAACGCATTGTATACGTTTGAAGCTTTCAGCAAAGGATATACCGTGGAAAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC7007GGAGTTCGGTGGTTTTTCTTTATTTTTCAAACTGTGTATTTTCTTTGACCCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG7008TCAGTCTCGAGTCAATCTACTAGGCGAACACC7009GACTGAATTCATGTACACGCCTATCCCTGCTAATACC7010TCGCCCCGGGTCTACTAATACTGTTCCCTC7011ACAGTGTCGATTTCCTGTGCACATACGTTCTGTATAGTGGTTATTCCTGGAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC7012GTGGATGAAGTATCTATAAACGGGGTTAGCCTAATGCTGAAAAGCCCGTGCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG7013CACATACGTTCTGTATAGTGG7014AGACCCTGGTTAGCCACAGAC7045CCAGGGAGCTCTTATGTTCGGTATATACAAGTATGTAGAG7046GGTCCGGATCCAGGAATAACCACTATACAGAACGTATGTG7047GGACCGAGCTCGGAGGGGTGTTCATGCCATGG7048GCCTTCTGCAGCCACGGTATATCCTTTGCTGAAAGCTTC7055GACTGGATCCATATGTCTACTAATACTGTTCCCTC7073CATGACCATGGTCTCACAAGAATATACAAC7074CATGTCTGCAGCTAAGTTTCACTCTCAC7110TCTTTCGGTGTATCTTTCGATGATAATTTGCGA7111AACTTTGAAACACCCAAGGGTCCTGGCTATCACTTTTGATTT7128TCTTACACAACGGAAAGCCCAGCTATGTGCGGATGGTGATATGAAAAT7129TCTTACACAATGAAAAGCCCAACTATGGGCAGATGGTGATATAAAAAT7235CAACTGCAGATGTACCCATACGACGTACCTGATTACGCATATCCGTATGATGTGCCGGACTATGCTTACACGCCTATCCCTGCTAA7236ACGGGATCCATGTACCCATACGACGTACCTGATTACGCATATCCGTATGATGTGCCGGACTATGCTTCTACTAATACTGTTCCCTC7303GTTCCATGAAAATAGCAAAGAATCTGCCTTCCTGGCAAACGGATTTATATC7785ATAAAAAGAGTGTCTAGAAGGGTC7786TATGCTATAAAGAAATTGTACTCCAG7787ATGTCTGCAATTAATCATCTTTGTTTGAAACTTATTTTGGCGAGTTTCGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC7788TTAATATGTTGGTTTACAGACATTTATTAAGACTGTAGAATACTTCGTGACTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG7796GCCGGAGCTCTTCGGCATCTTCAGCTAC7797CATACGGATATGCGTAATCAGGTACGTCGTATGGGTAAGCGATGGGTTCCAATGTAG7798CGCCTCGAGTCATTAAGCATAGTCCGGCACATCATACGGATATGCGTAATCAG7799AATAAACATCGGTACCATCGGTCATGTCGCCCACGGTAAATCCACAGTAGAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC7780TGCTTTTGACCATCTGTTTTGACACCTAATAGACGACGTAGCAAAAAGAGACACGCCATAAAGTGTGGC7801CGAAATTATCAACAGGCAAGCTAC7802GACCATAAGAACTTCATTTGGCTC7830GACTCGGATCCATGAGTGACTTACAAGACC7831AGTCGCTCGAGTTAAGCGATGGGTTCCAATG7832GACATGGATCCATATGTTCTCACAAGAATATACAAC7833GCTGTCTCGAGCTAAGTTTCACTCTCACTATCACTG Open table in a new tab Construction of Yeast Strains—Gene disruptions were made by direct transformation of the appropriate yeast strains with the PCR products (25Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRS400 was used as a template for PCR amplification of the geneticin resistance marker with primers 4949 and 4950. The cdc123-disrupting product from this reaction was used to transform diploid S. cerevisiae strain SEY6210.5. Integration of the marker into the YLR215C locus was confirmed by PCR with primers 4948 and 4951. A resulting cdc123 heterozygous strain BY116 was transformed with the plasmids pB121, pB174, or pB179. Transformants carrying these plasmids were induced to sporulate, and resulting tetrads were dissected using a micromanipulator (26Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Each dissection yielded viable G418-resistant haploids, whereas dissection of nontransformed BY116 did not yield G418-resistant haploids. Dissections were performed on YPD plates, except for the transformant carrying plasmid pB174, which was dissected on YPGal medium. Haploids selected for the further experiments were named BY116a[pB121], BY116a[pB174], and BY116a[pB179]. The strain obtained by screening of the mutagenized CDC123 library for temperature-sensitive mutants was named BY116a [pB464]. The CHF1 gene in strain SEY6210 was replaced by the HIS3 marker amplified from pRS413 with the primers 7011 and 7012. A homologous deletion by recombination was confirmed by PCR with primers 7013 and 7014. This strain was named BY225. Strain BY226 was constructed from strain SEY6211 by CHF2 gene replacement with the TRP1 marker amplified from plasmid pRS414 with primers 7006 and 7007. Proper integration was confirmed with primers 7002 and 7004. A diploid strain heterozygous for both CHF1 and CHF2 was created by mating strains BY225 and BY226. One of the CDC123 gene alleles in a resulting diploid was replaced by a geneticin resistance marker, as described above, to create the triply heterozygous strain BY229. This strain was transformed with plasmid pB319, induced to sporulate, and dissected. One of the haploids obtained from this dissection, with the genotype cdc123::kanMX, chf1::HIS3, chf2::TRP1, carrying plasmid pB319 was named BY232. The GCD11 open reading frame was disrupted in strain BY116 (heterozygous for cdc123::kanMX) by integrative transformation with a DNA fragment obtained by amplification of the HIS3 marker from plasmid pRS413 with primers 7799 and 7800. Correct integration of the marker into the GCD11 locus was confirmed by PCR with primers 7801 and 7802. The resulting strain was transformed with plasmids pB464 and pB463. Selected double transformants were subjected to sporulation and tetrad analysis. This procedure yielded isolates named BY290-1a and BY290-14a with both cdc123 and gcd11 genes disrupted, carrying plasmids pB464 and pB463. Two other strains generated in this procedure, BY290-3a and BY290-4d, are wild type at the CDC123 locus and carry a gcd11::HIS3 mutation covered by plasmid pB463. bar1 deletion was created by transformation of the diploid strain with the PCR product generated with primers 7787 and 7788 using plasmid pRS413 as a template for this reaction. Transformants were tested for integration of the HIS3 marker into the bar1 locus with primers 7785 and 7786. A MATα haploid generated after sporulation of this strain was crossed to strain BY116a carrying plasmid pB464. Sporulation and dissection of the resulting diploid yielded strain BY286 of genotype MATa cdc123::kanMX bar1::HIS3 [pB464] for assays of pheromone sensitivity. Two-hybrid Screening and β-Galactosidase Assays—Two-hybrid screening was performed as described using plasmid pACT2, a yeast cDNA library in λACT2, and yeast strain Y190 (27Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 331-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bait plasmid was created by cloning the CDC123 open reading frame in plasmid pOBD (29Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). To create prey plasmids for β-galactosidase assays, wild-type and mutant CHF1 alleles were cloned into plasmid pACT2. Y190 cells transformed with pairs of bait and prey plasmids were grown on selective liquid media to mid-exponential phase. For assays of β-galactosidase activity, equal numbers of exponentially growing cells were harvested. Assays were performed using 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate and normalized to units/min/ml/OD according to the methods of Guarente (30Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Results are presented as a percentage of the activity in the wild-type CDC123-wild-type CHF1 sample, which, at 14.4 units/min/ml/OD, was the pair of highest interaction. Generation of cdc123 Temperature-sensitive Alleles—To generate a library of cdc123 mutants, the gene was used as a template for error-prone PCR using 100 μm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and 1 mm dCTP, and amplified products were cloned into vector pRS414. The library was selected for complementation at 28 °C, and transformants were screened for temperature sensitivity at 37 °C as described under “Results.” Flow Cytometric Analysis—DNA was stained with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes), and flow cytometry was performed using a Beckman Coulter FACScan instrument as described (31Fortuna M. Sousa M.J. Corte-Real M. Leao C. Salvador A. Sangonetty F. Robinson J.P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Dean P. Orfao A. Rabinovitch P. Stewart C.C. Tanke H. Wheeless L. Current Protocols in Cytometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 11.13.1-11.13.9Google Scholar). Western and Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—A FLAG epitope was inserted at the N terminus of Cdc123. HA epitopes were added to the C termini of Chf1, Chf2, and Gcd11. Strains expressing FLAG-CDC123 and GAL1-driven CHF-HA alleles were used to assay Cdc123-Chf interactions. A strain expressing FLAG-CDC123 and GCD11-HA from native promoters was used to test Cdc123-Gcd11 association. Whole cell extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis. For Western analysis, anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies and secondary rabbit anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Sigma. For co-immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with anti-HA antibodies immobilized on agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline; antigens were eluted with 8 m urea, and Western transfers were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Reactions were developed with chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Sigma). CDC123 Is the Functional and Structural Homolog of Mammalian D123—The human D123-coding sequence was first isolated from a cDNA expression library as a suppressor of the temperature-sensitive mutation in rat cell line 3Y1tsD123, which arrests in G1 phase at restrictive temperature (32Okuda A. Kimura G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mutant D123 protein has an Ala-109 → Val alteration in sequence (32Okuda A. Kimura G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and was reported to result in a polypeptide that is degraded at the restrictive temperature (33Okuda A. Ohtsu M. Kimura G. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) in a lactacystin-sensitive manner (34Okuda A. Ohtsu M. Kimura G. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The D123 gene is expressed in the cytosol of human and rat tissues, with expression in testis being highest (35Onisto M. Zeilante P. Scannapieco P. Pellati D. Pozza M. Caenazzo C. Negro A. Garbisa S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Comparison of human D123 protein with sequences deposited in GenBank™ revealed apparent orthologs in animals, fungi, plants, and protists. An alignment of D123 proteins from human, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Dictyostelium discoideum is presented in Fig. 1. To study function of the 35% identical S. cerevisiae protein, the sequence of which was deposited in GenBank™ (accession number BK005577), we made a geneticin-resistant disruption of the YLR215C gene (hereafter CDC123), in yeast diploid cells to generate strain BY116, heterozygous at cdc123. After meiosis, sporulation and dissection of spores, we found that haploid isolates segregated 2:2 for viability, and none of the viable isolates were geneticin-resistant (Fig. 2A). Examination of the nongrowing isolates revealed micro-colonies of ∼8–16 cells, suggesting, as in the case of CAK1 (36Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Erdjument Bromage H. Tempst P. Morgan D.O. Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), that CDC123 encodes an abundant and/or long lived essential protein that is depleted in mutant cells after three to four divisions. To exclude the possibility that the gene is required for spore germination and is later dispensable, a human D123 cDNA from HeLa cells was amplified and cloned into a yeast vector under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Dissection of the BY116 strain transformed with this plasmid yielded tetrads with four viable progeny (Fig. 2B). In these tetrads, geneticin resistance segregated 2:2, and geneticin-resistant colonies exhibited galactose-dependent growth (Fig. 2C). Additionally, URA3-based plasmid pB121 constructed to express yeast CDC123 from its own promoter, introduced into heterozygous diploids and recovered in cdc123Δ haploids, could not be cured although the same plasmid could be easily lost from CDC123 wild-type cells (data not shown). These results show that the CDC123 gene is essential for viability and that the mammalian D123 gene is a structural and functional homolog of CDC123.Fig. 2CDC123 is a D123 homologous essential gene. A, CDC123 is an essential gene. Dissection of a CDC123/cdc123::kanMX diploid strain yielded two viable geneticin-sensitive spores per tetrad. B, human D123 cDNA complements deletion of yeast CDC123. The cdc123 heterozygous diploid strain transformed with a plasmid expressing GAL1-driven human D123 dissected on galactose plates yielded four viable spores, two of which carry cdc123 deletion and a plasmid with the human D123 cDNA. C, growth of cdc123 deletion isolates depends on human D123 expression. Three independent isolates exhibited galactose-dependent growth.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mutation of cdc123 Results in G2 Delay and G1 Cell Cycle Arrest—To determine the essential function or functions of CDC123, the products of error-prone PCR amplification of the gene were cloned in a yeast vector with a TRP1-selectable marker to generate a mutagenized library. This library was transformed into the cdc123Δ haploid strain carrying plasmid pB121. Transformants were selected on 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for pB121 plasmid loss (38Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), indicating complementation of cdc123Δ at 28 °C, and then screened for temperature sensitivity at 37 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1985425648,"Dorsoventral pattern formation of the optic cup is essential for vertebrate eye morphogenesis and retinotectal topographic mapping. Dorsal and ventral aspects of the eye are distinct at early stages of development; cVax homeodomain protein expression is confined to the ventral optic cup, whereas Tbx5 (T-box transcription factor) expression domain becomes restricted to the dorsal region. Misexpression of cVax or Tbx5 induces profound defects in eye morphology and abnormal visual projections. In the Pax6-/- mutant Tbx5 fails to be expressed, and Vax1 and -2 are abnormally present in the entire optic vesicle. During eye development Pax6 becomes expressed in a gradient at the optic cup stage due to the specific activation of a highly conserved intronic α enhancer in the Pax6 locus. We observed that the highest level of Pax6 in the optic cup corresponds to the boundary between non-overlapping cVax and Tbx5 territories. To further investigate how these transcription factors control the patterning of the eye, we overexpressed Pax6 in the chick optic cup (E2) using in ovo electroporation. We observed that overexpression of Pax6 extends the Tbx5 and Bmp4 domains but reduces the cVax expression domains in the E3 chick eye. This results in an abnormal eye phenotype at E4. In addition, we showed that cVax and Tbx5 interact with Pax6 and modulate in an opposite manner the activity of the Pax6 α enhancer. Moreover, the Pax6/cVax interaction inhibits the transactivation properties of Pax6. These results demonstrate that Pax6 together with cVax and Tbx5 mediate dorsoventral patterning of the eye.

Moreover, the Pax6/cVax interaction inhibits the transactivation properties of Pax6. These results demonstrate that Pax6 together with cVax and Tbx5 mediate dorsoventral patterning of the eye. Formation of the vertebrate eye involves a series of morphogenetic and inductive events that begin with the evagination of the optic vesicles from the forebrain. This is followed by invagination of the optic vesicles to create the optic cups. This results in the formation of two layers giving rise to the retina pigment epithelium, the neural retina, parts of the ciliary body, and a portion of the iris (1Sivak B. Sivak J. Fini M.E. Vertebrate Eye Development. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 1-14Google Scholar). An early and key event in eye development is the establishment of the nasal-temporal and dorsalventral axes in the optic primordium, which is fundamental for the later formation of the retinotectal projections. Development of the dorsoventral polarity has already been initiated in the optic vesicle stage and precedes the onset of neuronal differentiation (2Dutting D. Meyer S.U. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 921-931PubMed Google Scholar, 3Uemonsa T. Sakagami K. Yasuda K. Araki M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At this stage gene expression is restricted along the dorsoventral axis, thus dividing the retina into several domains (4Peters M.A. Cepko C.L. Dev. Biol. 2002; 251: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two transcription factors expressed in a mutually exclusive manner specify the dorsal and ventral compartments of the developing retina; Tbx5, a member of the T-box gene family, is expressed in the dorsal part of the retina in mouse and chicken (5Gibson-Brown J.J. Agulnik S.I. Silver L.M. Papaioannou V.E. Mech. Dev. 1998; 74: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6Gibson-Brown J.J. Agulnik S.I. Silver L.M. Niswander L. Papaioannou V.E. Development. 1998; 125: 2499-2509PubMed Google Scholar). Misexpression of Tbx5 in the developing eye induced dorsalization of the eye and altered projections of retinal ganglion cell axons (7Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Takeuchi J.K. Matsumoto K. Momose T. Uno K. Hoepker V. Ogura K. Takahashi N. Nakamura H. Yasuda K. Ogura T. Science. 2000; 287: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Vax homeodomain protein expression is restricted to the ventral part of the developing eye in mouse (Vax1 and -2) and chicken (cVax) (8Schulte D. Furukawa T. Peters M.A. Kozak C.A. Cepko C.L. Neuron. 1999; 24: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Vax2 inactivation in mouse revealed an important role of this gene in the specification of the ventral optic vesicle (9Barbieri A.M. Broccoli V. Bovolenta P. Alfano G. Marchitiello A. Mocchetti C. Crippa L. Bulfone A. Marigo V. Ballabio A. Banfi S. Development. 2002; 129: 805-813PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mui S.H. Hindges R. O'Leary D.D. Lemke G. Bertuzzi S. Development. 2002; 129: 797-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Misexpression of cVax leads to ventralization of the retina and abnormal retinotectal projections (8Schulte D. Furukawa T. Peters M.A. Kozak C.A. Cepko C.L. Neuron. 1999; 24: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, the correct expression of Tbx5 and cVax is critical for the early determination of the dorsal and ventral compartments of the eye and for the proper development of the retinotectal projections. Pax6 is a highly conserved transcription factor with two DNA binding domains, the paired and the homeodomain, and a transactivation domain (11Martin P. Carriere C. Dozier C. Quatannens B. Mirabel M.A. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Saule S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar, 12Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1531-1540PubMed Google Scholar). Pax6 encodes different proteins through alternative splicing and internal initiations (13Carriere C. Plaza S. Martin P. Quatannens B. Bailly M. Stehelin D. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Three proteins of 48, 46, and 43 kDa contain a paired domain, but two proteins of 33 and 32 kDa are devoid of this DNA binding domain. Pax6 is required for the proper development of the pancreas and the nervous system, where it is known to be critical for eye development (14Chow R.L. Altmann C.R. Lang R.A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 1999; 126: 4213-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Simpson T.I. Price D.J. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Pax6 is expressed in presumptive eye tissues. Both the semi-dominant inheritance pattern of the Pax6 mutant phenotype (16Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 17Hill R.E. Favor J. Hogan B.L. Ton C.C. Saunders G.F. Hanson I.M. Prosser J. Jordan T. Hastie N.D. van Heyningen V.

Rashbass P. van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) indicate that achieving the correct level of Pax6 is important for development of a normal eye. Because in Pax6-/- mice formation of the embryonic eye is disrupted early in development when the optic vesicle fails to form an optic cup (19Grindley J.C. Davidson D.R. Hill R.E. Development. 1995; 121: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the function of Pax6 at these early steps is not well understood. Pax6 is first widely expressed in the optic vesicle. Later, in the optic cup, Pax6 becomes expressed in a distal (high)-proximal (low) gradient due to the specific activity in the retina of a highly conserved intronic enhancer named α (20Plaza S. Dozier C. Langlois M.C. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 892-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Baumer N. Marquardt T. Stoykova A. Ashery-Padan R. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Development. 2002; 129: 4535-4545PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this gradient initiates at the timing of dorsoventral axis formation, at the onset of cVax expression and when Tbx5 becomes restricted to the dorsal part of the retina. In addition, it was recently reported that in the Pax6-/- mouse mutant small eye (Sey), Tbx5 failed to be expressed, whereas Vax1/Vax2 expression extended over the entire optic vesicle (21Baumer N. Marquardt T. Stoykova A. Ashery-Padan R. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Development. 2002; 129: 4535-4545PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of particular interest to investigate the relevance of Pax6 for cVax/Tbx5 expression and its potential role in the dorsoventral patterning of the eye. Overexpression of Pax6 in the chick optic cup using in ovo electroporation extended Tbx5 and Bmp4, reduced cVax expression domains, and caused defects in eye morphology. In addition, we showed that Tbx5 and cVax interact with Pax6 and that they modulate in an opposite manner the activity of the Pax6 α enhancer. Finally, we observed that in the optic cup the highest level of Pax6 expression corresponds to the boundary between the non-overlapping cVax and Tbx5 territories. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Pax6, together with cVax and Tbx5, contributes to the establishment of the dorsoventral axis of the retina. Plasmids—Green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; BHK, baby hamster kidney; TK, thymidine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. was expressed from the pVNC3-EGFP vector. Quail cDNA encoding the Pax6 isoforms such as p46, p48, and p30 (12Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1531-1540PubMed Google Scholar) and the mouse Mitf cDNA were cloned into the pSG5 expression vector (22Planque N. Leconte L. Coquelle F. Martin P. Saule S. J. Biol.

The p46Δ48–211 resulted from a PstI fragment deletion, and the p46Δ170–342 resulted from a KpnI fragment deletion of the pSG5p46 (12Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C. Bailly M. Martin P.

Dozier C. Langlois M.C. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 892-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as GST-p46, paired and homeodomains (24Plaza S. Langlois M.C. Turque N. LeCornet S. Bailly M. Begue A. Quatannens B. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1115-1125PubMed Google Scholar). For the synthesis of GST-cVax, a 983-bp fragment of cVax cDNA, was generated by PCR using the pVNC7cVaxHA vector as a template and primers containing cloning sites (GGGACGTGCAGCCGAATTCCATGTTTGGGAAACAAG and CCGCTCGAGCTTTATTGTTGGTCCGGGAGTAGGG) and cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-3. In Ovo Chick Electroporation—Fertilized white Leghorn chick embryos were incubated at 38 °C in a humid atmosphere for 2 days. DNA (2 μg/μl) was injected into one optic cup of HH stage12–13 (E2) chick embryos. An electric current (5 × 20-V pulses for 50 ms, with an interval of 500 ms between each pulse) was then applied over the optic cup using an ECM 830 BTX electroporator. The untreated optic cup served as an internal control. Expression of GFP was detected with a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica MZFLIII). GFP-positive embryos were processed for in situ hybridization or incubated for a longer period of time. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (25Lecoin L. Sii-Felice K. Pouponnot C. Eychene A. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the Pax6 cDNA was linearized with XhoI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase to generate a RNA probe. Probes for the chick cVax, Tbx5, and Bmp4 genes were kind gifts from Drs. Paola Bovolenta and Maria Marx and were prepared as described (26Logan M. Simon H.G. Tabin C. Development. 1998; 125: 2825-2835PubMed Google Scholar, 27Monsoro-Burq A. Le Douarin N.M. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Simultaneous detection of cVax and Tbx5 transcripts using two-color in situ hybridization was performed by sequential detection of digoxygenin- and fluorescein-labeled probes with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies (28Zuniga A. Haramis A.P. McMahon A.P. Zeller R. Nature. 1999; 401: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). After in toto hybridization treatment, embryos were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, 15% saccharose for 24 h at 4 °C, embedded in phosphate-buffered saline, 15% saccharose, 7.5% gelatin, frozen, and cryostat-sectioned. In Vitro Translation and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assays—The 35S-radiolabeled proteins were translated in vitro using the TNT system (Promega). The GST chimerical proteins were extracted from bacteria after the Amersham Biosciences instructions. The pull-down assays were performed as previously described (22Planque N. Leconte L. Coquelle F. Martin P. Saule S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29330-29337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Percentage of retention was measured for each condition after exposure of the protein gel to a phosphorimaging screen. Cell Cultures and Transfection Assays—Baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Dissociated quail neuroretina cells dissected from 8-day-old quail embryos were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% minimal essential medium vitamins 100×, and 10 μg/ml conalbumin. BHK21 cells transfections were performed with polyethyleneimine (exgen 500, Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim) reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A CMV-LacZ vector was co-transfected for normalization of CAT assays by controlling the β-galactosidase activity. Quail neuroretina cell transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method. CAT assays were performed as previously described (20Plaza S. Dozier C. Langlois M.C. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 892-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of CAT activity were quantified after exposure of the thin-layer chromatograms to a PhosphorImager screen. Overexpression of Pax6 in the Optic Cup Leads to an Abnormal Eye Phenotype—In the Pax6 mutant mouse (Sey), dorsal characteristics of the optic cup are lost at the expense of ventral ones, suggesting that Pax6 may play a role in regulating retinal dorsoventral polarity. To test this possibility we used in ovo electroporation to overexpress different Pax6 constructs in the chick optic cup. These constructs are depicted in Fig. 1A. First, a plasmid carrying the full-length cDNA coding for p46 or p48 and a plasmid carrying the green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were co-electroporated into one optic cup of E2 chick embryos (HH 12–13); the other eye of the same embryo served as a control. This enabled visualization of the electroporation target site by virtue of GFP expression. As a negative control embryos were electroporated with the plasmid carrying GFP alone. 48 h later eyes electroporated with p46 or p48 showed an abnormal phenotype (Fig. 1, B and D); oval-shaped eyes were formed instead of normal round eyes, and Pax6-electroporated eyes were rotated toward the ventral midline and sometimes presented a widened optic fissure (Fig. 1B). This phenotype was not observed after electroporation of GFP alone (Fig. 1C) or microphthalmia (Mitf, another transcription factor important for eye development (Ref. 22Planque N. Leconte L.

To investigate which domain of Pax6 was involved in the eye phenotype, we electroporated different constructs including the p30 Pax6 isoform and two truncated forms of Pax6 (p46Δ48–211 and p46Δ170–342). The same abnormal eye phenotype was observed after electroporation of p30, which is devoid of the paired domain (Fig. 1E). The p46Δ170–342 contains an intact paired domain but is devoid of the homeodomain and part of the transactivation domain, which abolishes transactivation activity (Fig. 1A) (12Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1531-1540PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the same abnormal eye morphology was observed after electroporation of the p46Δ170–342 (Fig. 1F), indicating that the eye phenotype we observed was independent of the transactivation properties of Pax6. Electroporation of the p46Δ48–211, which lacks both in the paired and homeodomain but contains the entire transactivation domain, did not alter eye morphology (Fig. 1G). Taken together these results suggest that, in contrast to the transactivation domain, both of the DNA binding domains in Pax6, namely the paired and the homeodomains, were involved in causing the observed abnormal eye morphology. Overexpression of Pax6 Reduces cVax and Extends Tbx5 and Bmp4 Expression Domains—To address the relationship between this abnormal eye phenotype and the expression profiles of known early markers of dorsoventral polarity, we examined the consequence of overexpressing Pax6 in the optic cup on cVax, Tbx5, and Bmp4 expression. Embryos were sacrificed 24 h after electroporation and analyzed for gene expression by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Electroporation of GFP alone or p46Δ48–211 did not alter the expression domains of cVax, Tbx5, or Bmp4 (data not shown). However, overexpression of the different Pax6 constructs (p30, p46, p48, and p46Δ170–342) caused an expansion of the dorsal markers (Tbx5 and Bmp4) and a reduction of the ventral marker cVax (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Any modification in the gene expression territory was measured using metamorph software. For example, we observed an extension of the Tbx5 territory after overexpression of p46 (compare Figs. 2, A and B) or p30 (compare Figs. 2, C and D). Extension of the Bmp4 expression domain was also observed after p46 overexpression (compare in situ staining in Figs. 2, F and I with E). These extensions correlated with the electroporated retinal domain as indicated by GFP expression (Fig. 2, G and J). Analyses of eye sections confirmed the extension of the Bmp4 expression domain (Fig. 2H). The cVax expression domain was reduced after misexpression of Pax6. Fig. 2, K—P, shows two examples of embryos electroporated with the p46 (Fig. 2, K–M) and the p48 (Fig. 2, N–P) isoforms. Compared with the control eyes, the injected eyes showed a reduction of the cVax expression domain (compare Fig. 2, K and N with L and O). Analyses using serial sections confirmed that cVax expression was reduced and limited to the ventral most region of the retina (Fig. 2M). In the ventral view, intensity of the cVax staining in the optic stalk was reduced in the electroporated side compared with the control side (Fig. 2P). cVax and Tbx5 Proteins Physically Interact with Pax6 Paired and Homeodomains—Because both the Pax-6 paired domain and homeodomain were independently able to alter cVax and Tbx5 expressions patterns, we tested whether Pax6 interacts physically with cVax and Tbx5. To this end we prepared glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with a GST fusion protein containing the full-length Pax6 protein (GST-p46; amino acids 1–416), the full-length Tbx5 protein (GST-Tbx5), or the full-length cVax protein (GST-cVax). Glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to GST alone served as a negative control. No interaction was detected with the radiolabeled GFP protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3) or with the GST alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 1, 5, 8, 11; B, lanes 1 and 4; C, lanes 1 and 5). However, strong protein-protein interactions were observed between Pax6 and cVax (Fig. 3A, lane 6) as well as between Pax6 and Tbx5 (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 12). To identify which domains of Pax6 are required for physical interaction with Tbx5 and cVax, we used GST fusion proteins containing either the paired domain from the p46 (GST-paired; amino acids 3–131) or the p46 homeodomain (GST-homeo; amino acids 224–284). Both the Pax6 paired and homeodomains were independently able to bind the radiolabeled Tbx5 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3) or cVax (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that both domains are involved in Pax6/Tbx5 and Pax6/cVax interactions. Finally, we tested these interactions with the truncated form p46Δ48–211, which did not alter eye morphology and did not change dorsoventral marker expression patterns. Fig. 3C shows that the interactions observed with the p46 wild type protein (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3) as well as with the paired-less proteins (arrowhead) produced by internal initiation (13Carriere C. Plaza S. Martin P. Quatannens B. Bailly M. Stehelin D. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were almost completely lost with the p46Δ48–211 protein (Fig. 3C, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that cVax/Pax6 or cVax/Tbx5 protein-protein interactions do not involve the transactivation domain but require the paired and/or the homeodomains. The Highest Level of Pax6 Expression in the Chick Optic Cup Corresponds to the Boundary between cVax and Tbx5 Territories—It has been previously shown that Pax6 is expressed in a distal (high) proximal (low) gradient in the developing mouse eye. This pattern of expression appears at the optic cup stage and results from the activity of the conserved α enhancer in intron 4 of the Pax6 genomic locus (21Baumer N. Marquardt T. Stoykova A. Ashery-Padan R. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Development. 2002; 129: 4535-4545PubMed Google Scholar). To compare the spatial expression profiles of the early known markers of dorsoventral polarity cVax and Tbx5 with Pax6 in the chick optic cup, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization of E3 chick embryos. As shown in Fig. 4A, Tbx5 and cVax were expressed in non-overlapping domains in the optic cup; Tbx5 was restricted to the dorsal part of the retina, whereas cVax was present in the ventral retina and the optic stalk. In addition, there was a white narrow band at the nasal/temporal level of the retina separating cVax and Tbx5 expression domains (Fig. 4A, arrows). Interestingly, this cVax/Tbx5 boundary corresponded to the highest activity of Pax6 expression in the optic cup (Fig. 4B, arrows). In summary, at the early optic cup stage (HH18–19), the retina is divided into four domains of restricted gene expression along the dorsoventral axis; they are a first dorsal domain where Pax6 and Tbx5 are coexpressed, a second domain where only Pax6 is strongly expressed, a third domain where Pax6 and cVax are coexpressed, and finally, a ventral domain where only cVax is present (Fig. 4C). cVax Represses Whereas Tbx5 Increases Pax6 α Enhancer Activity in Vitro—Because Pax6 activity via the intronic α enhancer contributes to the establishment of Pax6 gradient expression in the mouse retina (21Baumer N. Marquardt T. Stoykova A. Ashery-Padan R. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Development. 2002; 129: 4535-4545PubMed Google Scholar), we next asked whether cVax or Tbx5 could directly modulate Pax6 regulatory sequences. We used two constructs containing the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter driving the CAT reporter gene alone (pTKCAT) or linked to the Pax6 α enhancer (pTKCAT-EP). E8 quail neuroretina cells were transfected with cVax or Tbx5 together with the CAT constructs. Compared with the basal activity observed with the TK promoter alone, transfection of the α enhancer alone resulted in a 4-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig. 5A). The CAT activity of the α enhancer was reduced in presence of cVax in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). By contrast, Tbx5 expression increased the activity of the α enhancer (Fig. 5A). These data show that cVax and Tbx5 were able to modulate Pax6 α enhancer activity but in an opposite way, suggesting that they might contribute to the establishment of the Pax6 gradient. Because cVax and Tbx5 proteins were able to physically interact with Pax6, we then asked whether these interactions could modulate the Pax6 transcriptional activity in vitro. We used as a Pax6 target gene the glucagon promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene (23Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Klages N. Saule S. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4124-4132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). cVax and Tbx5 were cotransfected with Pax6 in BHK21 cells together with the glucagon promoter. Compared with the vector control, Pax6 expression resulted in a 35-fold increase of CAT activity (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection of cVax with Pax6 resulted in a reduction of the Pax6 transcriptional effect in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection of Pax6 with increasing amounts of Tbx5 did not change its transactivation level (Fig. 5B). These data show that cVax, but not Tbx5, was able to repress Pax6 transcriptional activity in vitro. Our data provide evidence that overexpression of Pax6 at the optic cup stage caused dorsalization of the developing eye by up-regulating Tbx5 and down-regulating cVax. Tbx5 and cVax interact with Pax6 and modulate in an opposite manner the activity of the Pax6 α enhancer, which is essential for its gradient expression. Most importantly, the present results suggest that Pax6 is involved in delimiting a boundary between the dorsal and the ventral compartments of the developing eye. Molecular Dorsalization of the Developing Eye after Pax6 Overexpression—In this study we report that overexpression of Pax6 promoted dorsalization of the optic cup; extension of the dorsal markers, Tbx5 and Bmp4, and reduction of the ventral marker cVax were observed in the developing eye after Pax6 overexpression. Consistent with our data, it was previously reported that misexpression of Tbx5 (7Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Takeuchi J.K. Matsumoto K. Momose T. Uno K. Hoepker V. Ogura K. Takahashi N. Nakamura H. Yasuda K. Ogura T. Science. 2000; 287: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or Bmp4 (7Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Takeuchi J.K. Matsumoto K. Momose T. Uno K. Hoepker V. Ogura K. Takahashi N. Nakamura H. Yasuda K. Ogura T. Science. 2000; 287: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29Sasagawa S. Takabatake T. Takabatake Y. Muramatsu T. Takeshima K. Genesis. 2002; 2: 86-96Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) caused dorsalization of the eye. Conversely, misexpression of cVax has been shown to ventralize the retina (8Schulte D. Furukawa T. Peters M.A. Kozak C.A. Cepko C.L. Neuron. 1999; 24: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Previously, BMP4 and the morphogen sonic hedgehog have been involved in patterning the dorsoventral axis of the eye by antagonistic actions (29Sasagawa S. Takabatake T. Takabatake Y. Muramatsu T. Takeshima K. Genesis. 2002; 2: 86-96Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Barbieri A.M. Lupo G. Bulfone A. Andreazzoli M. Mariani M. Fougerousse F. Consalez G.G. Borsani G. Beckmann J.S. Barsacchi G. Ballabio A. Banfi S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 14: 10729-10734Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 31Zhang X.M. Yang X.J. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 271-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observe that Pax6 electroporation produced similar effects to those found after Bmp4 overexpression (29Sasagawa S. Takabatake T. Takabatake Y. Muramatsu T. Takeshima K. Genesis. 2002; 2: 86-96Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or after blocking Sonic hedgehog activity by antibodies (31Zhang X.M. Yang X.J. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 271-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In all cases, the expression of dorsal markers was expanded, whereas ventral markers were reduced, and similar morphological defects (eye deformation and rotation toward the ventral midline) were observed. Interestingly, oval-shaped eyes were also observed after overexpression of Tbx5 (7Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Takeuchi J.K. Matsumoto K. Momose T. Uno K. Hoepker V. Ogura K. Takahashi N. Nakamura H. Yasuda K. Ogura T. Science. 2000; 287: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because of Tbx5 up-regulation and cVax down-regulation in Pax6 misexpressing eyes, the morphological defects that we observe could result from an abnormal development of the dorsal retina at the expense of the ventral retina. In the Pax6-/- mutant mouse (Sey), Tbx5 is no longer expressed, whereas Vax1/Vax2 extend to the entire optic vesicle (21Baumer N. Marquardt T. Stoykova A. Ashery-Padan R. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Development. 2002; 129: 4535-4545PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of Pax6 induces ventralization of the eye, whereas overexpression of Pax6 causes dorsalization of the eye, suggesting that, during normal development, Pax6 may activate Tbx5 and repress Vax. Pax6 Interacts with Tbx5 and cVax for Dorsoventral Patterning of the Eye—What are the molecular mechanisms by which Pax6 regulates Tbx5 and cVax activity? Our data suggest that the observed eye phenotypes arise as a result of Pax6 protein interactions with cVax and Tbx5 rather than by a direct effect of Pax6 on cVax or Tbx5 regulatory sequences. First, we observed that all the Pax6 isoforms we electroporated (p46, p48, and p30) were able to dorsalize the eye. The p46 and p48 paired domains bind distinct DNA sequences, which are also different from the one recognized by the homeodomain (32Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very unlikely that these Pax6 isoforms share the same target genes. Second, the p46Δ170–342, which is no longer able to transactivate (12Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1531-1540PubMed Google Scholar), was still able to dorsalize the eye, suggesting that this phenotype was independent from Pax6 transcriptional activation abilities. Thus, we favored the hypothesis that protein-protein interactions are involved in eye dorsalization. Indeed, we demonstrated that Pax6 protein was able to interact with both Tbx5 and cVax proteins. We observed that the two Pax6 DNA binding domains (paired and homeodomain) were also able to bind both Tbx5 and cVax proteins. Consistent with this, both the p30 isoform, which contains only the homeodomain, and the p46Δ170–342 construct, which contains only the paired domain, were able to dorsalize the eye. In addition, the p46Δ48–211 construct, which lacks both DNA binding domains but contains the entire transactivation domain, did not interact with cVax or Tbx5. We did not observe any abnormal eye phenotypes or alterations in cVax/Tbx5 expression patterns after p46Δ48–211 electroporation. This suggests that these protein-protein interactions occur via the paired, the homeodomain, or both. At the functional level, we showed that Pax6/cVax interaction inhibited Pax6 transactivation properties. Because Pax6 is able to transactivate its own promoters (20Plaza S. Dozier C. Langlois M.C. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 892-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of Pax6 activity through cVax interaction contributes to Pax6 down-regulation, also mediated by the c-Vax repression of the intronic α enhancer in the retina. Pax6/cVax interaction may, therefore, play an important role in the early determination of the dorsal versus ventral retina. A Gradient of Pax6 Expression May Be Required for Establishing Dorsal-Ventral Boundary in the Developing Eye—Pax6 has been shown to be expressed in a gradient in the developing mouse eye after activation of an intronic α enhancer. Before optic cup formation, Pax6 is widely expressed in the optic vesicle and the surface ectoderm. Then, at the optic cup stage, Pax6 becomes expressed in distal high, proximal low gradient (21Baumer N. Marquardt T. Stoykova A. Ashery-Padan R. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Development. 2002; 129: 4535-4545PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is precisely at this stage that Tbx5 and cVax become restricted to the dorsal and ventral part of the retina, respectively. We observed the same expression patterns in the chick optic cup. In the chick eye, Tbx5 expression is first detected throughout the retina at stage 11 then becomes confined to the dorsal part from stage 14 (7Koshiba-Takeuchi K. Takeuchi J.K. Matsumoto K. Momose T. Uno K. Hoepker V. Ogura K. Takahashi N. Nakamura H. Yasuda K. Ogura T. Science. 2000; 287: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast to Tbx5, cVax expression extends from the telencephalic ventral midline toward the optic vesicles, where it is exclusively expressed in the ventral retina from stage 14 (8Schulte D. Furukawa T. Peters M.A. Kozak C.A. Cepko C.L. Neuron. 1999; 24: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, during normal eye development, cVax is never expressed in the dorsal part of the eye. Because in the Pax6 mutant, Vax1 and -2 expression extends over the entire optic vesicle, Pax6 may be involved in restricting Vax expression to the ventral retina, thus inhibiting Vax extension at the dorsal-ventral boundary. Our data support this hypothesis. First, we observed that the highest level of Pax6 gradient expression corresponds to the boundary between dorsal and ventral compartments. Second, Pax6 overexpression in vivo caused cVax repression and Tbx5 up-regulation. Third, cVax inhibited the activity of the α enhancer, which is important for the establishment of a Pax6 gradient in the optic cup. Fourth, we observed an inhibitory interaction at the protein level between cVax and Pax6. These data taken together suggest that the Pax6 gradient of expression would be involved in separating dorsal and ventral compartments of the optic cup. The highest level of Pax6 expression may be required for forming the dorsal/ventral boundary in the developing eye, acting as a barrier between dorsal and ventral determinants by promoting dorsal fate (Tbx5, BMP4) and repressing ventral fate (cVax). Interestingly, Pax6 has been involved in the dorsoventral patterning of several neural tissues including spinal cord (33Ericson J. Rashbass P. Schedl A. Brenner-Morton S. Kawakami A. van Heyningen V.

A. 1999; 96: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For example, transient dorsal expression of Pax6 during pituitary gland development is required for establishing a sharp boundary between dorsal and ventral cell types (35Kioussi C. O'Connell S. St.-Onge L. Treier M. Gleiberman A.S. Gruss P. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These findings highlight the importance of Pax6 in early eye development. The role of Pax6 in morphogenesis and retinal dorsoventral axis formation underlines the fact that Pax6 acts not only as a transcription factor but also through interactions with others transcription factors.

We detected strong EGCase activity in animals belonging to Cnidaria, Mollusca, and Annelida and cloned the enzyme from a hydra, Hydra magnipapillata. The hydra EGCase, consisting of 517 amino acid residues, showed 19.2% and 50.2% identity to the Rhodococcus and jellyfish EGCases, respectively. The recombinant hydra enzyme, expressed in CHOP (Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing polyoma LT antigen) cells, hydrolyzed [14C]GM1a to produce [14C]ceramide with a pH optimum at 3.0-3.5. Whole mount in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical analysis revealed that EGCase was widely expressed in the endodermal layer, especially in digestive cells. GM1a injected into the gastric cavity was incorporated and then directly catabolized by EGCase to produce GM1a-oligosaccharide and ceramide, which were further degraded by exoglycosidases and ceramidase, respectively. However, hydra exoglycosidases did not hydrolyze GM1a directly. These results indicate that the EGCase is indispensable for the catabolic processing of dietary glycosphingolipids in hydra, demonstrating the unique catabolic pathway for glycosphingolipids in the animal.

The ceramide portion of the GSL molecule is embedded in the fluid phase of the plasma membrane, and a sugar chain faces the external environment. Some GSLs are considered to be receptors for microorganisms and their toxins as well as modulators of cell growth and differentiation (1Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Recently, GSLs were found to be enriched with other sphingolipids and cholesterol to form microdomains on ectoplasmic membranes (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8012) Google Scholar). These lipid microdomains, known as detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched domains, glycolipid-enriched membranes, or rafts, assemble receptors and signaling molecules coupled to Src family kinases and G-proteins on their inner surface and mediate cell adhesion, membrane trafficking, and signaling activities (3Hakomori S. Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixCrossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In mammals, after recycling between the plasma membrane and intracellular organs, GSLs are eventually transported to lysosomes where they are all hydrolyzed sequentially from the non-reducing end by exo-type glycohydrolases (4Kolter T. Sandhoff K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1532-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, the catabolic pathway of GSLs in invertebrates has yet been elucidated.Endoglycoceramidase (EGCase, or ceramide glycanase) is a GSL-specific enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage between oligosaccharides and ceramides of various GSLs (5Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme has been found in both prokaryotes (microorganisms) and eukaryotes (invertebrates); i.e. actinomycetes (5Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bacteria (6Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), leech (7Zhou B. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Huang R.T.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12272-12277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), short-necked clam (8Basu S.S. Dastgheib-Hosseini S. Hoover G. Li Z. Basu S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), earthworm (9Li Y.-T. Ishikawa Y. Li S.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and jellyfish (10Horibata Y. Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31297-31304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A previous study has revealed that many opportunistic microbes can produce EGCase, and a relationship between pathogenicity and EGCase is suspected (11Ito M. Komori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12655-12660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the functions of animal EGCases have not yet been clarified.In this study, we cloned a new acidic EGCase from the Hydra magnipapillata and analyzed the function of this animal EGCase. We found that the enzyme, present in endodermal cells, was transiently released into the gastric cavity during the feeding process. The EGCase was able to hydrolyze dietary GSLs to produce oligosaccharides and ceramides. When GM1a 2The abbreviations for gangliosides follow the nomenclature system of Svennerholm (39Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). 2The abbreviations for gangliosides follow the nomenclature system of Svennerholm (39Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). was injected into the gastric cavity, it was incorporated and catabolized directly to ceramide and oligosaccharide. The former was further converted to fatty acid and fatty acid-derived metabolites, whereas the latter was converted to shorter chain oligosaccharides, possibly GM2- and GM3-oligosaccharides. It was, however, noted that GM1a per se was resistant to hydrolysis by hydra exoglycosidases. These results strongly suggest that EGCase is involved in the catabolic processing of dietary GSLs in hydra. This catabolic pathway is completely different from that of mammals, which are likely to be missing the EGCase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—GM1a was prepared from crude bovine brain ganglioside using the sialidase-producing bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. YF-2 as previously described (12Fukano Y. Ito M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1861-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]GM1a, labeled at the fatty acyl chain in ceramide ([14C]stearic acid, d18:1 sphingenine), or sialic acid/GalNAc residues in sugar chain was prepared as described in a previous study (13Mitsutake S. Kita K. Nakagawa T. Ito M. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Globoside was obtained from Iatron Lab. Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). GT1b, GD1a, GD1b, GD3, GM3, asialo-GM1, and lactosylceramide (LacCer) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). GL-4 (Galβ1,6Galβ1,6Glcβ1,1′ Cer) was donated from Dr. M. Hoshi, Keio University, Japan (14Kubo H. Jiang G.J. Irie A. Morita M. Matsubara T. Hoshi M. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). l-5-(GalNAcα1,4GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Manβ1,4Glcβ1,1′ Cer) from larvae of the green bottle fly, Lucilia caesar (15Sugita M.

Sugita, Shiga University, Japan. Neogalatriaosylceramide (TGC; Galβ1,6Galβ1,6Galβ1,1′ Cer) was isolated from a turban shell, Turbo cornutus, by a method described previously (17Matsubara T. Hayashi A. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 and Lubrol PX were obtained from Sigma and Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), respectively. A precoated Silica Gel 60 TLC plate was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All other reagents were of the highest purity available.Hydra Culture—Strain 105, the standard wild-type strain of H. magnipapillata, was used in this study. Animals were cultured in hydra medium (1 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 1 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm MgSO4) at 18 °C using the standard method (18Sugiyama T. Fujisawa T. Dev. Growth Differ. 1977; 19: 187-200Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Freshly hatched brine shrimp (Artemia salina) were fed to hydra three times a week, and the medium was changed daily. Before the experiment, animals were starved for 3 days.EGCase Assay—Ten nanomoles of GM1a (containing 100 pmol of [14C]stearyl-GM1a, 5 nCi) was incubated at 37 °C for a specific period with an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.0, containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. The reaction was stopped by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. After drying, the sample was dissolved in 20 μl of 50% methanol and applied to TLC plates, which were then developed with chloroform/methanol/0.02% CaCl2 (5/4/1, v/v). Radioactive GM1a and ceramide separated by TLC were analyzed with an imaging analyzer (FLA-5000, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and quantified with Image Gauge version 3.0 (Fujifilm). One unit of the EGCase was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the release of 1 μmol of GM1a/min under the conditions described above. A value of 10-3, 10-6, and 10-9 units of enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit, 1 microunit, and 1 nanounit, respectively.For substrate specificity, non-radioactive GSLs (10 nmol of each) were employed. GSLs and oligosaccharides were visualized by spraying the TLC plates with orcinol-H2SO4 regent and scanning them by using a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (Kyoto, Japan) with the reflectance mode set at 540 nm.Ceramidase Assay—The activity of ceramidase was measured using C12-NBD-ceramide (NBD-C12:0, d18:1) as a substrate (19Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 100 pmol of C12-NBD-ceramide was incubated with the enzyme in 20 μl of the indicated buffer containing 0.4% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 16 h. After drying, the sample was dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) and applied to a TLC plate, which was then developed with chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (90/20/0.5, v/v). C12-NBD-fatty acid was separated from C12-NBD-ceramide by TLC and then analyzed and quantified with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (excitation 475 nm, emission 525 nm).Purification of Hydra EGCase—H. magnipapillata (5.2 g) was homogenized in 20 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and Complete™, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), and centrifuged at 10,500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (specific activity, 0.5 milliunit/mg) was then applied to a column of Hi-Trap phenyl-Sepharose (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The enzyme was eluted from the column with the same buffer containing 1% Lubrol PX. The active fractions from the phenyl-Sepharose column were pooled (specific activity, 2.2 milliunits/mg) and subjected to chromatography using Hi-Trap SP-Sepharose (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The enzyme was eluted from the column with the same buffer containing 1.0 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled (specific activity, 16.9 milliunits/mg), and the buffer was replaced with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, using a Centriprep-10 (Millipore). The enzyme was then applied to a TSK gel CM-5PW column (5 × 50 mm, Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) using the BioCAD SPRINT system (Applied Biosystems) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX. The column was washed with the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0 to 0.1 m) in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions showing the enzyme activity were replaced with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, using a Centriprep-10. Characterization of the native hydra EGCase was performed using this final preparation (specific activity, 38.2 milliunits/mg). Throughout the course of purification, specific activity was increased by 76.4 times with 22.8% recovery. The preparation showed no detectable exoglycosidases except β-glucocerebrosidase.Molecular Cloning and Sequencing—Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with a Bigdye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and a DNA Sequencer (model 377A, Applied Biosystems). The initial search for the hydra EGCase cDNA was conducted using PCR. Based on the conserved sequence in microbial and jellyfish EGCases, degenerate primers of both sense and antisense strands were designed. A sense oligonucleotide primer, YLD (5′-CTNGAYATGCAYCARGA-3′), and an antisense primer, YNE (5′-GCRAANGGYTCRTTDAT-3′), were synthesized. PCR amplification was performed using these primers with first strand cDNA as a template in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and their DNA sequences were determined. The PCR products were also labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Ready-To-Go DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used as a probe to screen a hydra cDNA library constructed using Lambda ZAPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Finally, a full-length cDNA clone encoding hydra EGCase was obtained by plaque hybridization. The plasmid containing hydra EGCase was designated pSKHEGC.In Situ Hybridization—Digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes corresponding to the sense and antisense strands of the full-length cDNA of hydra EGCase were prepared using a DIG RNA Labeling Mix (Roche Diagnostics). In situ hybridization of whole mounts was carried out as described previously (20Grens A. Mason E. Marsh J.L. Bode H.R. Development. 1995; 121: 4027-4035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hydra were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after relaxation of the polyps with 2% urethane. Specimens were subsequently treated with ethanol and proteinase K. To stabilize the digested tissues, specimens were re-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then prehybridized in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 200 μg/ml tRNA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% CHAPS, and 100 mg/ml heparin) to block nonspecific hybridization sites. This was followed by hybridization for 16 h with the DIG-labeled RNA probe and subsequent washing in hybridization solution and then in 1× SSC. The specimens were further washed in MAB (100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and pre-blocked for 2 h in MAB with 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics). This was followed by a 16-h incubation at 4 °C in the same solution with anti-DIG antibody (Roche Diagnostics). The specimens were washed eight times with MAB and then briefly in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.5, containing 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Specimens were then stained with BM-purple (Roche Diagnostics).Expression of Hydra EGCase in CHOP Cells—A cDNA fragment encoding the hydra EGCase was prepared by PCR using a 5′ primer containing a Kozak sequence (21Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar) and EcoRI site (5′-GGAATTCACCATGGTAAGCGTCGCACTTAT-3′), a 3′ primer containing an XhoI site (5′-CCCTCGAGTTCTGATAGATGTTTATCACCCA-3′), and pSKHEGC as a template with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and introduced into these sites in the vector of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+)A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). CHOP cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing polyoma LT antigen to support the replication of eukaryotic expression vectors (22Hefferman M. Dennis W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at 105 cells/dish. Transfection with vector alone or vector containing hydra EGCase was performed using Lipofect-AMINE™ Plus (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After 4 h of incubation with the mixture, the cells were grown in fresh medium. After 24 h, cells were harvested and suspended in 100 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The enzyme activity in the cell lysate was measured as described above.Release of EGCase—One-hundred starved hydra were fed brine shrimp, washed, and then cultured in fresh hydra medium (1 ml/well on 6-well plates). After a period of time, 100 μl of the medium was withdrawn and then centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 5 min. The EGCase activity of the supernatant was assayed at 37 °C for 2 h using [14C]stearyl-GM1a as a substrate.In Vivo Digestion of [14C]GM1a in Hydra—50 pmol of [14C]GM1a (2.5 nCi), dissolved in hydra medium (∼1 μl), was injected through the mouth into the gastric cavity of the hydra using a micropipette. Just before the injection, the hydra were fed brine shrimp. After the animals were cultured for a period at 18 °C, total lipids were extracted from 10 animals by homogenization with 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (1/2, v/v). The extract was evaporated dry, redissolved in 20 μl of the same solvent, and analyzed by TLC, using a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (60/35/8, v/v). Radioactive lipids were analyzed by the method described above.Extraction of Glycolipids from Brine Shrimp and Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectrometry—Total lipid was extracted from 13 g of freshly hatched brine shrimp by homogenization with 15 ml of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v). The extraction was repeated twice. Combined extracts were divided into upper and lower phases with Folch's partition (23Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After being evaporated to dryness, the lower phase was incubated in 0.1 m methanolic KOH at 37 °C for 1 h to eliminate glycerolipids. After the removal of salt using Folch's partition, the lipid was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (98/2, v/v) and applied to a column of Sep-Pak plus silica (Waters Co., Milford, MA). GSLs were eluted from the column with methanol. Each fraction was spotted onto a TLC plate, developed in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/0.02% CaCl2 (5/4/1, v/v), and visualized by spraying with orcinol-H2SO4 reagent. For fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, GSLs were purified by TLC. The portions corresponding to the orcnol-H2SO4-positive bands were scraped from the unstained duplicate TLC plate and then extracted with chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v). After removal of the silica by centrifugation, the supernatant was dried under N2 gas. Approximately 10 μg of GSL was mixed with triethyleneglycol as a matrix and subjected to FAB mass spectrometric analysis, which was performed in the negative ion mode.Fatty Acid and Sugar Composition Analysis—The fatty acid and sugar compositions of hydra GSL were analyzed by the methods described previously (24Yamakawa T. Ueta N. Jap. J. Exp. Med. 1964; 34: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yamakawa T. Ueta N. Jap. J. Exp. Med. 1964; 34: 361-374PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, methyl esters of fatty acids and methyl glycosides were obtained by methanolysis of GSLs with 1.0 m anhydrous methanolic HCl at 100 °C for 3 h. Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane, and the methyl glycosides remaining in the methanolic solution were concentrated, N-acetylated, and trimethylsilylated. The fatty acid and sugar compositions were determined separately by GLC on a Shimadzu GC-14A equipped with a fused silica capillary column (DB-1, 0.25 mm × 30 m, J & W Scientific).Preparation of Anti-hydra EGCase Antibody—To obtain the recombinant hydra EGCase, the ORF was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET32b (Novagen, Madison, WI), and introduced into AD494(DE3)pLysS, an Escherichia coli strain, for protein expression. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in 1.5 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 15 μg/ml kanamycin, and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet (inclusion bodies) was lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 8 m urea. The recombinant protein was purified using a Hi-Trap chelating column (Ni2+, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified protein was then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the protein band was extracted from the gel using 20 mm Tri-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1% SDS. Antiserum against recombinant hydra EGCase was obtained from a rabbit immunized with the purified protein.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205964) Google Scholar). The transfer of protein to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was performed using Trans-Blot SD (Bio-Rad) as described previously (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44703) Google Scholar). After treatment with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with anti-hydra EGCase antiserum for 1 h at room temperature. After a wash with T-TBS, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h. After another wash with T-TBS, the ECL reaction was performed for 2-3 min as recommended by the manufacturer, and chemiluminescent signals were visualized with an ECL Mini-camera (Amersham Biosciences).Immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence Microscopy—Hydra were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h after relaxation of the polyps with 2% urethane. The samples were rinsed with PBS and then infiltrated with 20% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. They were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Co., Tokyo, Japan), rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The frozen materials were cut into 9- to 10-μm thick sections using a cryostat (Leica CM1850, Wetzlar, Germany) and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides. After treatment with 5% skim milk in PBS (blocking buffer) for 20 min at room temperature, the samples were incubated with the anti-hydra EGCase antiserum diluted 1:500 with a blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature followed by Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 h. For controls, pre-immune serum was used as the primary antibody. For nuclear staining, SYTOX Green (Invitrogen) was used. To identify more precisely the EGCase-expressing cells, macerated samples were used. Hydra were placed in maceration fluid, acetic acid/glycerol/water (1/1/13, v/v), for 10 min, and then shaken to disperse the cells (28David C.N. Wilhelm Roux Arch. Entw. Mech. Org. 1973; 171: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The suspended cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and spread on a gelatin-coated glass slide. Immunostained samples were observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Digital Eclipse C1, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).Other Methods—The protein content was measured by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Glycopeptidase F treatment was conducted using the purified hydra EGCase as described previously (10Horibata Y. Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31297-31304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Exoglycosidases and sialidase were assayed using p-nitrophenyl glycosides (29Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 702-713Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and 4-methylum-belliferyl-N-acethylneuraminic acid (12Fukano Y. Ito M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1861-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, as the substrate.RESULTSDistribution of EGCase in Animals—The EGCase activity in various invertebrates was examined using [14C]GM1a ([14C]stearic acid, d18:1 sphingenine) as the substrate (Table I). The activity was found to be widely distributed in animals of the phyla Cnidaria, Mollusca, and Annelida. In addition to the animals listed in Table I, we detected EGCase activity in sea sponges, baby octopus, ear shells, etc., but not in mammalian or insect cell lines such as HEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells), COS-1 cells (African green monkey cells), and Schneider 2 cells (Drosophila melanogaster cells) (data not shown). Among the animals tested, we found a relatively high specific activity of EGCase in cnidarians and thus selected H. magnipapillata as a model to study the biological roles of animal EGCase.Table IDistribution of animal EGCasesPhylumGenusCommon namemicrounits/mgCnidariaCyanea nozakiiJellyfish74.7Hydra magnipapillataHydra232.5Aiptasia sp.Sea anemone240.3Entacmaea sp.Sea anemone234.6MolluscaCellana sp.Limpet11.8Batillus sp.Turban shell5.8Meretrix sp.Hard clam4.4Ruditapes sp.Short necked clam4.6AnnelidaMarphysa sp.Marine worm3.2 Open table in a new tab General Properties of the Hydra EGCase—First, EGCase was purified from extracts of H. magnipapillata by conventional column chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The optimum pH of the purified enzyme was found to reside in an extremely acidic range, pH 3.0-4.0, when [14C]GM1a was used as a substrate (Fig. 1A). The enzyme required detergents for the hydrolysis of GSLs. The optimal concentrations of Triton X-100 and Lubrol PX were 0.2% (w/v) and 0.4% (w/v) at pH3.0, respectively, although taurodeoxycholate at 0.1-1% (w/v) strongly inhibited the enzyme activity. Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and EDTA had no significant effects on the activity at 5 mm. Fig. 1B shows the specificity of the purified enzyme for various GSLs. The extent of hydrolysis of GSLs by the enzyme was expressed under different conditions; one expressed the relative initial reaction velocity (30 min, open bar) and the other the degree of hydrolysis after"
https://openalex.org/W1972747200,"An accelerated activity of the GD3 synthase (ST8), with consequent GD3 accumulation, is part of the response to environmental stressors in different cell types. Depending on specific, yet largely undefined, cellular settings, this can be followed by adaptation or apoptosis, the latter mostly due to GD3-induced mitochondrial damage. Here we show that subcellular localization of ST8 could significantly affect the biological outcome of GD3 accumulation. Binding to the molecular chaperone calnexin causes the retention of ST8 within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and prevents its relocalization to the Golgi. Calnexin-dependent ER retention does not affect the activity of ST8; yet the de novo synthesized GD3 largely fails to reach the mitochondria. Accordingly, overexpression of calnexin suppresses the pro-apoptotic activity of ST8, while the loss of calnexin sensitizes the cells to ST8-induced apoptosis. Reconstitution of calnexin confers protection to deficient cells. Thus, calnexin controls the biological outcome of GD3 accumulation and reveals a novel role in the stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2035917312,"To identify molecules that might contribute to V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) trafficking or signaling, we searched for novel interacting proteins with this receptor. Preliminary data, using the V2R C terminus as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, revealed calmodulin as a binding partner. Because calmodulin interacts with other G protein-coupled receptors, we explored this interaction and its possible functional relevance in greater detail. A Ca2+-dependent interaction occurs between calmodulin-linked agarose and the holo-V2R as well as the V2R C terminus. Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis of the V2R C terminus revealed an involvement of an RGR sequence in this interaction. NMR studies showed that a peptide fragment of the V2R C terminus containing the RGR sequence binds to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner with a Kd ≤1.5 μm; concentration-dependent binding of the V2R C terminus to calmodulin-agarose was used to estimate a Kd value of ∼200 nm for this entire C-terminal sequence as expressed in mammalian cells. Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells stably expressing either wild type or a mutant V2R, in which the RGR C-terminal sequence was mutated to alanines (AAA V2R), revealed that the steady-state localization and agonist-induced internalization of the AAA V2R resembled that of the wild type V2R in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells. V2R binding of agonist similarly was unchanged in the AAA V2R, as was the concentration response for arginine vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Most interestingly, AVP-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ observed for the wild type V2R were virtually eliminated for the AAA V2R. Taken together, the data suggest that a C-terminal region of the V2R important for calmodulin interaction is also important in modulation of V2R elevation of intracellular Ca2+, a prerequisite for AVP-induced fusion of aquaporin-containing vesicles with the apical surface of renal epithelial cells.

Zuhlke K. Krause G. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8384-8392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The V2R binds the agonist arginine vasopressin (AVP) and signals through the heterotrimeric protein Gs to promote water reabsorption and concentration of the urine in the collecting duct of the kidney (2Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petaja-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). AVP is a cyclic nonapeptide hormone, 8-arginine vasopressin, that is secreted by the posterior pituitary in response to low urine osmolality or to decreased blood pressure (2Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petaja-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). AVP binds to the V2R on the basolateral surface of the principal cells of the renal collecting duct, couples to Gs, and stimulates adenylyl cyclase. The subsequent increase in intracellular cAMP leads to activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylation of aquaporin-2, and the translocation of pre-formed aquaporin-2-containing vesicles to the apical membrane of the principal cells (3van Balkom B.W.

This translocation appears to involve calcium in some (4Chou C.L. Yip K.P. Michea L. Kador K. Ferraris J.D. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Biol.

Because the calmodulin inhibitor W7 blocks the AVP-induced stimulation of water flow in the toad urinary bladder (7Levine S.D. Kachadorian W.A. Levin D.N. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 67: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the rat inner medullary collecting duct (4Chou C.L. Yip K.P. Michea L. Kador K. Ferraris J.D. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J.

The ultimate insertion of aquaporin 2 water channels into the apical membrane allows the renal epithelial cells to absorb water, which accounts for the antidiuretic effect of AVP. The C-terminal region of the V2R has been shown to be important for agonist-mediated phosphorylation (8Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Eberle A.N. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol.

Consequently, we decided to explore proteins that might interact with the V2R C terminus with the intent of understanding their possible role in V2R trafficking or signaling. Materials—Human wild type (WT) V2R cDNA was graciously provided by Dr. Jürgen Wess. The pEBG-SrfI mammalian GST expression vector was generously supplied by Dr. Yusen Liu (NIA, National Institutes of Health). [2,8-3H]Adenine (30.4 Ci/mmol), 8-arginine [phenylalanyl-3,4,5-3H]vasopressin (60.0 Ci/mmol), [8-14C]cAMP ammonium salt (51.2 mCi/mmol), [methoxy-3H]inulin-methoxy (430 mCi/g) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Additional [2,8-3H]adenine (24.2 Ci/mmol) was purchased from MP Biomedicals. Paraformaldehyde (16% solution, EM grade) was from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Washington, PA). PVDF nylon membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Dowex AG50 W-X4 resin, 40% acrylamide, TEMED, ammonium persulfate were from Bio-Rad. cAMP (sodium salt), alumina, [Arg8]vasopressin (acetate salt), bacitracin, bovine serum albumin, calmodulin-agarose (phosphodiesterase 3′:5′-cyclic nucleotide activator from bovine brain), fetal calf serum, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), probenecid, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and Triton X-100 were from Sigma. The mouse HA.11 monoclonal antibody (5 μg/μl) directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag engineered into the N terminus of the various V2R structures was obtained from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA). Rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (100 μg/ml, clone 3F10) against the HA epitope tag was obtained from Roche Applied Science, and the Alexafluor-488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (2 μg/μl) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Protein A beads were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). EZ-link™ sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-biotin and Immunopure™ immobilized streptavidin were from Pierce. The 12- and 24.5-mm polycarbonate membrane filters (Transwell chambers, 0.4 μm pore size) were obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Aqua-Poly/Mount was from PolySciences Inc. (Warrington, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and trypsin/EDTA were prepared by the Cell Culture Core facility sponsored by the Diabetes Research and Training Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Cell Lines—Permanent clonal MDCKII cell lines expressing HA epitope-tagged WT and mutant V2Rs were developed using the CaPO4 method as described previously (7Levine S.D. Kachadorian W.A. Levin D.N. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 67: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of V2pcD-N-HA and pCMV4N-V2R-AAA (individual cDNAs encoding HA epitope-tagged human WT or mutant (AAA) V2Rs, respectively) were each co-transfected with 2 μg of pRSVneo (cDNA encoding neomycin resistance) into MDCKII cells. Colonies were selected based on resistance to G418, a neomycin analog, and isolated as described previously (7Levine S.D. Kachadorian W.A. Levin D.N. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Investig. 1981; 67: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). G418-resistant colonies were screened for WT or AAA V2R expression by assaying binding of the radioligand [3H]AVP. Parental and stably expressing V2R MDCKII cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Simian kidney fibroblast (COS M6) cells were maintained in supplemented DMEM + 20 mm HEPES. The studies presented were obtained in the WT V2R, clone 61, which expresses the HA epitope-tagged WT V2R at a density of 4.3 ± 1.0 pmol/mg specific [3H]AVP binding per mg of protein, estimated in homologous competition binding studies. Studies with AAA V2R exploited two independent clonal cell lines, clone 5 (6.7 ± 1.5 pmol/mg protein) and clone 11 (3.2 ± 2.0 pmol/mg protein). Generation of cDNAs Encoding GST-V2R-C Terminus—The cDNAs encoding the GST-FLAG-V2R-C terminus constructs in the pEBG-SrfI vector were generated via overlapping PCR extension using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The FLAG tag was inserted immediately 5′ to the V2R C-terminal sequence and downstream of the GST start site and coding sequence. The AAA V2R construct, containing the holo-V2R receptor in pCMV4, was generated using the QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNAs were sequenced in their entirety to confirm that the sequences were correct. Transient Expression Studies—COS M6 cells were seeded the day prior to transfection at a density of 7.5 × 105 (60-mm dish) or 1 × 106 (100-mm dish). On the day of transfection, FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was placed dropwise into a polypropylene tube containing Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. According to the manufacturer's instructions, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was placed into an additional tube, and the FuGENE mixture was placed dropwise on top of the DNA in a ratio of 3 μl of FuGENE to 1 μg of DNA, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and placed onto the cells in their existing culture medium. We used 1 μg of DNA per 60-mm dish and 3 μg of DNA per 100-mm dish, respectively. The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 prior to assessment 48 h post-transfection. Calmodulin-linked Agarose Pull-down Experiments—Cells were placed on ice and washed once with DPBS-CM (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4,1mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3). Cells were extracted into ice-cold dodecyl-β-d-maltoside:cholesteryl hemisuccinate buffer (DβM: CHS: 4 and 0.8 mg/ml, respectively, containing 20% glycerol, 25 mm glycylglycine, 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μm PMSF, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4), sequentially triturated with 22- and 25-gauge needles, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The detergent-solubilized supernatant was precleared with BSA linked to agarose beads and incubated overnight with calmodulin-linked agarose (Sigma) that had been precleared with parental cellular lysate that did not express the V2R or V2R-C terminus. The resin was washed three times with DβM:CHS wash buffer (DβM:CHS-wash: 0.5 and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively, containing 25 mm glycylglycine, 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and eluted into 1× Laemmli buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to PVDF, and blotted for receptor using either the mouse anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:2000) or the mouse anti-HA.11 (Babco; 1:1000) monoclonal antibodies. When binding to calmodulin, agarose was assessed as a function of calcium concentration, and the amount of free calcium present in solution was calculated using the MaxChelator program, version 2.10 (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html). Estimation of V2R-C Terminus Affinity for Calmodulin—Supernatants from COS M6 cells transiently expressing either the WT or AAA GST-FLAG-V2R-C terminus were prepared as described above. The WT V2R or AAA V2R-expressing cells were solubilized by scraping 100-mm dishes (2Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petaja-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D.

(Lond.). 2002; 538: 891-899Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) into 1.5 ml of DβM-CHS extraction buffer. For some experiments, the extract of AAA V2R was concentrated further using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices. Serial dilutions of the WT lysate were performed to obtain a saturation binding curve for binding of the C terminus to a constant quantity of calmodulin-linked agarose, and binding to calmodulin-agarose was performed as described above. The amount of GST-C-terminal protein in the eluate and total fractions was determined quantitatively by comparison to known amounts of bacterially expressed GST. The Western blot bands were quantitated using Scion Image software. NMR Sample Preparation and Spectroscopy—A peptide fragment of the V2R C terminus (339LLSSARGRTPPSLGPQDES357 with the cysteines normally acylated in V2R (Cys-341 and Cys-342) mutated to serine) was ordered from Genemed Synthesis and subsequently purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Purity of the eluted peptide was confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry. The final peptide was lyophilized and resuspended at 10 mg/ml in 500 mm Tris, pH 7.0. A bacterial expression vector for human calmodulin was kindly provided by Eva Thulin (University of Lund, Lund, Sweden) (11Vogel H.J. Lindahl L. Thulin E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 241-246Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli, and the bacteria were grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl. The bacteria were grown and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described previously (11Vogel H.J. Lindahl L. Thulin E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 241-246Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the growth protocol calls for serial dilution of bacteria growing at 30 °C, allowing the bacteria to double prior to each dilution. Following induction at 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacteria are incubated at 37 °C until growth stops. The protein was purified as described previously by Ca2+-dependent binding of calmodulin to phenyl-Sepharose. Samples were loaded in 1 mm CaCl2 and eluted at 1 mm EDTA. NMR samples were prepared by three steps of concentration and resuspension (100-fold dilution at each step) to thoroughly exchange purified calmodulin into 20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, supplemented with either 2 mm EDTA or 20 mm CaCl2. Final samples were adjusted to contain 10% D2O. The calmodulin concentration was determined by A276. Experiments were conducted on a Bruker Avance500 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Two-dimensional 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments were performed at 25 °C, acquiring four scans per increment and 512 points in the indirect (t1) dimension. NMR data were processed and analyzed in XWinNMR (Bruker). For the preliminary titration mentioned in the text (data not shown), the peptide was resuspended at 18.3 mg/ml in 100 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and Ca2+-calmodulin was prepared by thoroughly exchanging 15N-calmodulin into 20 mm bis-Tris, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5. Assessment of Transcellular Leaks of Polarized MDCKII Cells—Integrity of the cell monolayer via [3H]methoxy-inulin leak was accomplished exactly as described previously (12Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polarized Localization of V2R at Steady State—For these studies, the appropriate number of 24.5-mm Transwells of polarized (7 days growth) WT or mutant V2R were biotinylated with NHS-Biotin (1 mg/ml) on the apical or basolateral surface as described previously (12Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were scraped into RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors (100 μm PMSF, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) present, and the extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (detergent-solubilized preparation) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with streptavidin-agarose. The streptavidin-agarose resin was washed 2× with RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors and eluted with SDS sample buffer (1.6% SDS, 8.3% glycerol, 167 mm Tris, pH 6.8) for 10 min at 95 °C, and the eluate was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. The resolved proteins, representing the fate of the V2R at the cell surface at the time of biotinylation, were transferred to PVDF, and the biotinylated, epitope-tagged V2R was identified by Western blot analysis using mouse HA.11 antibody against the HA epitope. Cell Surface Receptor Quantitation via Intact Cell ELISA—MDCKII cells stably expressing WT V2R or AAA V2R were seeded at 1 × 104 cells per well of a 96-well plate 1–2 days prior to the experiment. The medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM 20 min before the assay. Cells were treated with either vehicle alone or with 1 μm AVP and placed in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 throughout the drug treatment. The vehicle was 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% BSA, 1 mg/ml bacitracin. After treatment, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.12 m sucrose in DPBS-CM for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with DPBS-CM for 5 min each and treated with 3% BSA in DPBS-CM to block nonspecific antibody binding for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with 1:500 of anti-rat HA (Roche Applied Science) in 3% BSA in DPBS-CM for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times with DPBS-CM. Cells were incubated with 1:100 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat (Amersham Biosciences) in 3% BSA in DPBS-CM for 1 h at 37 °C. The colorimetric substrate, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Pierce, 1 mg/ml), was added and incubated for 30 min to 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with the addition of an equal volume of 1 m sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 490 nm was determined for each well using a SpectraMAX 190 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). Four replicates of each treatment condition were performed per experiment. Immunolocalization of the Wild Type and Mutant V2R—Stably expressing WT V2R MDCKII cells were grown in clear 12-mm Transwell chambers and maintained for 6–9 days prior to fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were washed in DPBS-CM, rinsed with 50 mm NH4Cl in DPBS-CM for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in DPBS-CM for 15 min at room temperature. Permeabilized cells were washed once with DPBS-CM and incubated with DPBS-CM containing 2% BSA for 30 min. The Transwells were carefully cut away from their plastic support and placed into a 12-well plate for antibody labeling. The cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rat anti-HA monoclonal primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing cells three times in DPBS-CM (10 min/wash), a 1:1000 dilution of Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG in DPBS-CM with 2% BSA was added, and the cells were incubated in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed prior to mounting on glass slides with Aqua-Poly/Mount and covered with a glass coverslip. Slides were stored in the dark until examination with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning inverted microscope in the Vanderbilt Cell Imaging Core Facility. For the AVP-mediated internalization studies, polarized cells were treated either with vehicle alone or with 1 μm AVP, which was added to both the apical and basolateral chambers of the Transwells, and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 throughout the drug treatment. After treatment, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed and labeled for immunofluorescence examination as described. Competition Binding—To assess the potency of AVP in competing for the WT V2R and AAA V2R, [3H]AVP binding assays were performed. Confluent 100-mm dishes of MDCKII cells stably expressing the WT V2R or AAA V2R were placed on ice and washed once with DPBS-CM. The cells were scraped into 15:5:5 buffer (15 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) containing 100 μm PMSF and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15:5:5 buffer by sequential trituration with 22- and 25-gauge needles. Centrifugation and resuspension was repeated one time. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% BSA, and 1 mg/ml bacitracin, which was included to protect the radioligand from proteolysis. Membranes were incubated, with shaking, for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 1.4 nm [3H]AVP. The incubation was terminated by harvesting on a Brandel cell harvester. Nonspecific binding was defined as that binding detected in the presence of 10 μm AVP. The samples were counted using a Packard 1600 TR Tri-Carb scintillation counter. Kd and Bmax values were calculated from these homologous competition binding experiments as described by Limbird and Motulsky (13Limbird L.E. Motulsky H. Conn P.M. Goodman H.M. Handbook of Physiology: The Endocrine System Cellular Endocrinology. Oxford University Press, Inc., Oxford1998: 49-67Google Scholar). cAMP Accumulation—Basal or AVP-mediated cAMP accumulation in intact cells was measured by assessing the conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP in cells prelabeled with [3H]adenine to permit synthesis of [3H]ATP intracellularly. MDCKII cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well. Twenty four hours later, the cells were labeled overnight (12–16 h at 37 °C) in supplemented DMEM containing 6 μCi/ml of [3H]adenine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences or MP Biomedicals). On the day of the assay, cells were placed on a 37 °C plate and rinsed with DPBS-CM, and serum-free DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES was added. Cells were treated with AVP for 15 min, with vehicle alone to obtain basal cAMP levels, or with 10 μm forskolin to assess direct activation of adenylyl cyclase. Reactions were terminated by adding 750 μl of an ice-cold solution containing 12% trichloroacetic acid, 2 mm cAMP, 2 mm ATP, and [14C]cAMP (∼1400 cpm/ml) to permit an assessment of recovery of [3H]cAMP in subsequent purification steps. Cells were then placed on ice for 10 min, after which the reactions were transferred to glass test tubes using disposable transfer pipettes. Each well was washed with 120 μl of DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and combined with its respective harvested sample for a final volume of 2 ml. After neutralization with 120 μl of 5 n NaOH, cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatants were subjected to sequential Dowex and alumina column chromatography to isolate [3H]cAMP (14Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Recovery of [3H]cAMP from other triturated nucleotides during this procedure was corrected based on the recovery of [14C]cAMP tracer in the stop solution. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+—We used a FlexStation II (Molecular Devices) fluorometric imaging plate reader to measure changes in intracellular Ca2+. MDCKII cells stably expressing the WT V2R or AAA V2R were plated in 96-well clear bottom black microplates (Corning Glass) at ∼1 × 105 cells per well and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. On the day of the assay, cells were loaded with Calcium 3 dye (FLIPR Calcium 3 assay kit, Molecular Devices) for 1 h at 37 °C in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS), pH 7.4, containing 0.1% BSA and 2.5 mm probenecid, in the presence (Invitrogen catalog number 14065-056) of 1.26 mm calcium. After loading, cells were washed three times with 1× HBSS, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% BSA and 2.5 mm probenecid lacking calcium (Invitrogen catalog number 14185-052, supplemented with 0.9 mm magnesium). Cells were placed in 1× HBSS with or without calcium as indicated and placed in the FlexStation II for the assay. The machine was used in Flex mode, and the fluorescent intensity was measured from the bottom with the excitation at 485 nm and emission at 525 nm for 90 s at 25 °C. Trituration upon addition of compound during the FlexStation assay had no effect on the position of the AVP concentration-response curve for the WT V2R. The V2R C Terminus Interacts with Calmodulin in Vitro in a Calcium-dependent Manner—To investigate mechanisms involved in the processing and signaling of the V2R, we searched for proteins that could associate with the C terminus of the receptor, as this region had been implicated both in trafficking (9Schulein R. Hermosilla R. Oksche A. Dehe M. Wiesner B. Krause G. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and signaling (15Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies using yeast two-hybrid technology, we identified calmodulin as a potential interacting molecule with the V2R C terminus. Given recent reports that other GPCRs also interact with calmodulin (16Turner J.H. Gelasco A.K. Raymond J.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2156211809,"A rare form of human ACAT1 mRNA, containing the optional long 5′-untranslated region, is produced as a 4.3-kelonucleotide chimeric mRNA through a novel interchromosomal trans-splicing of two discontinuous RNAs transcribed from chromosomes 1 and 7 (Li, B. L., Li, X. L., Duan, Z. J., Lee, O., Lin, S., Ma, Z. M., Chang, C. C., Yang, X. Y., Park, J. P., Mohandas, T. K., Noll, W., Chan, L., and Chang, T. Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 11060–11071). To investigate its function, we express the chimeric ACAT1 mRNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells and show that it can produce a larger ACAT1 protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa on SDS-PAGE, in addition to the normal, 50-kDa ACAT1 protein, which is produced from the ACAT1 mRNAs without the optional long 5′-untranslated repeat. To produce the 56-kDa ACAT1, acat1 sequences located at both chromosomes 7 and 1 are required. The 56-kDa ACAT1 can be recognized by specific antibodies prepared against the predicted additional amino acid sequence located upstream of the N-terminal of the ACAT1ORF. The translation initiation codon for the 56-kDa protein is GGC, which encodes for glycine, as deduced by mutation analysis and mass spectrometry. Similar to the 50-kDa protein, when expressed alone, the 56-kDa ACAT1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is enzymatically active. The 56-kDa ACAT1 is present in native human cells, including human monocyte-derived macrophages. Our current results show that the function of the chimeric ACAT1 mRNA is to increase the ACAT enzyme diversity by producing a novel isoenzyme. To our knowledge, our result provides the first mammalian example that a trans-spliced mRNA produces a functional protein."
https://openalex.org/W2072348008,"CEL-I is a C-type lectin, purified from the sea cucumber Cucumaria echinata, that shows a high specificity for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). We determined the crystal structures of CEL-I and its complex with GalNAc at 2.0 and 1.7 Å resolution, respectively. CEL-I forms a disulfide-linked homodimer and contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds, although it lacks one intramolecular disulfide bond that is widely conserved among various C-type carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). Although the sequence similarity of CEL-I with other C-type CRDs is low, the overall folding of CEL-I was quite similar to those of other C-type CRDs. The structure of the complex with GalNAc revealed that the basic recognition mode of GalNAc was very similar to that for the GalNAc-binding mutant of the mannose-binding protein. However, the acetamido group of GalNAc appeared to be recognized more strongly by the combination of hydrogen bonds to Arg115 and van der Waals interaction with Gln70. Mutational analyses, in which Gln70 and/or Arg115 were replaced by alanine, confirmed that these residues contributed to GalNAc recognition in a cooperative manner.

Carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) have been shown to play important roles in molecular recognition processes in various tissues and body fluids. There are increasing numbers of animal lectins (1Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 2Dodd R.B. Drickamer K. Glycobiol. 2001; 11: 71R-79RCrossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), which are categorized into several families according to their structural homologies. Various proteins that display carbohydrate-binding activity in a Ca2+-dependent manner are classified into the C-type lectin family (3Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They contain C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; CTLD, C-type lectin-like domain; MBP, mannose-binding protein; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; rCEL-I, recombinant CEL-I; DC-SIGN, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin; DC-SIGNR, DC-SIGN-related molecule; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. composed of 110–130 amino acid residues in common. In vertebrate C-type lectins, the C-type CRDs mostly occur as carbohydrate-binding modules linked to other domains with distinct functions. They fall into seven groups (4Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and function through cooperation of the CRDs with other individual domains. In contrast, invertebrate C-type lectins are mostly single-domain proteins. One of their possible roles is thought to be inactivation or opsonization of foreign microorganisms in place of immunoglobulins in vertebrates. There are only limited numbers of C-type CRDs whose tertiary structures have been determined. Mannose-binding protein (MBP) was the first C-type lectin for which a crystal structure was determined (5Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This protein contains an N-terminal collagenous domain, followed by a link domain and a C-type CRD. The latter two domains have been expressed in a recombinant form, and the structure as well as various mutant forms have been analyzed by x-ray crystallography (6Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

In addition to MBP, the crystal structures of CRDs complexed with carbohydrates have been solved for DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR (11Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), P- and E-selectins (12Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 467-479Google Scholar), tunicate lectin TC14 (13.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar), and rattlesnake venom lectin RSL (14Walker J.R. Nagar B. Young N.M. Hirama T. Rini J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3783-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to these lectins, several C-type lectin-like domains (CTLD) without carbohydrate-binding ability have also been found (2Dodd R.B. Drickamer K. Glycobiol. 2001; 11: 71R-79RCrossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These lack the essential residues for carbohydrate binding, and instead many are thought to function as receptors for noncarbohydrate ligands. Although these proteins share only slight sequence similarity (∼20%), their tertiary structures are basically similar to each other (15Swaminathan G.J. Weaver A.J. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.L. Leonidas D.D. Gleich G.J. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26197-26203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We previously isolated four Ca2+-dependent galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins (CEL-I, -II, -III, and -IV) from the marine invertebrate Cucumaria echinata (Holothuroidea) (16Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Based on their amino acid sequences, CEL-I and CEL-IV are clearly categorized into the C-type lectin family, whereas CEL-III is a novel Ca2+-dependent lectin with strong hemolytic activity as well as cytotoxicity (17Oda T. Tsuru M. Hatakeyama T. Nagatomo H. Muramatsu T. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N.

(Tokyo). 1999; 125: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CEL-III shows sequence similarity with β-trefoil lectins, such as the B-chains of ricin and abrin (21Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The similarity of the three-dimensional structure of CEL-III with these proteins has recently been revealed by x-ray crystallographic analysis (22Uchida T. Yamasaki T. Eto S. Sugawara H. Kurisu G. Nakagawa A. Kusunoki M. Hatakeyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37133-37141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CEL-I, which is the smallest lectin in C. echinata, is composed of two identical 16-kDa subunits linked by a single interchain disulfide bond (23Hatakeyama T. Matsuo N. Shiba K. Nishinohara S. Yamasaki N. Sugawara H. Aoyagi H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CEL-I has very high specificity for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and its affinity for GalNAc is ∼1000-fold stronger than that for galactose as judged by hemagglutination inhibition assays. To date, no other C-type lectins with such high specificity for GalNAc have been identified. It is therefore of great interest to clarify the CEL-I-specific carbohydrate-recognition mechanism not only to understand the carbohydrate-recognition mechanism of C-type lectins but also the structural basis to design molecules with novel carbohydrate-specific affinity. We previously obtained single crystals of CEL-I that were suitable for x-ray diffraction studies (24Hatakeyama T. Matsuo N. Aoyagi H. Sugawara H. Uchida T. Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recently, we also succeeded in crystallizing the CEL-I-GalNAc complex. In this report, we describe x-ray crystallographic analyses of CEL-I and the CEL-I-GalNAc complex to elucidate the mechanism of its high specificity for GalNAc along with the site-directed mutagenesis experiments of a recombinant CEL-I (rCEL-I) that was expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Purification of CEL-I—CEL-I was purified from C. echinata according to a previously reported method (19Hatakeyama T. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3560-3564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The proteins extracted from a homogenate of C. echinata were applied to a lactose-Cellulofine column equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, (TBS) containing 10 mm CaCl2. Adsorbed lectins (CEL-I, -III, and -IV) were eluted with TBS containing 20 mm EDTA. The lectins were then separated using a GalNAc-Cellulofine column utilizing the differences in their carbohydrate-binding specificities. After elution of CEL-III with TBS containing 0.1 m lactose, CEL-I and CEL-IV were eluted with TBS containing 20 mm EDTA. CEL-I and CEL-IV were finally separated by gel filtration through Sephadex G-75 in TBS. Crystallizations and Data Collection—The purification and crystallization of native CEL-I have already been reported (24Hatakeyama T. Matsuo N. Aoyagi H. Sugawara H. Uchida T. Kurisu G. Kusunoki M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein solution (5 mg/ml, 2–4 μl) in TBS was mixed with the same amount of reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 60% MPD), and subjected to hanging or sitting drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C. X-ray data collection was performed on beamline BL-18B at the High Energy Acceleration Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan, using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD camera (25Watanabe N. Nakagawa A. Adachi S. Sakabe N. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1995; 66: 1824-1826Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The space group was monoclinic C2 with unit cell parameters of a = 92.4, b = 69.9, c = 76.7 Å, and β = 136.5°. Reduction of a total of 72,844 reflections from CEL-I crystals yielded 19,924 independent reflections with 92.3% completeness for a resolution range of 52.7–2.0 Å and an overall Rmerge of 6.1%. CEL-I-GalNAc complex crystals were prepared under essentially the same conditions as the native crystals except for the addition of 1 mm GalNAc to the samples. Because the complex crystals were initially formed as spherulites, these were used as seeds for a microseeding method. Single crystals of the CEL-I-GalNAc complex grew to sufficient sizes for data collection within one month. Data collection was performed at 100 K using a Rigaku R-AXIS VII imaging plate area detector equipped with a Rigaku FR-E SuperBright rotating-anode generator. Image data were processed by the programs MOSFLM (26Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; : 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (27Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The space group and unit cell parameters of the CEL-I/GalNAc crystals were determined to be P21 and a = 39.6, b = 52.2, c = 136.6, and β = 91.7°, respectively. Assuming two molecules of CEL-I, each composed of a homodimer in the asymmetric unit, the value of the Matthews constant, Vm (28Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar), is 2.20 Å3 Da-1 corresponding to a solvent content of 44.2%. The final data for the CEL-I-GalNAc complex crystals comprised 59,176 independent reflections with 96.3% completeness for a range of 33.8–1.7 Å and an overall Rmerge of 6.2%. The completeness and Rmerge for the highest resolution shell (1.79–1.70 Å) were 84.9 and 16.2%, respectively. Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structures of native CEL-I and the CEL-I-GalNAc complex were solved by the molecular replacement method. The search model for native CEL-I was based on the human lithostathine structure (PDB code 1LIT) (29Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which shares 28% amino acid sequence identity with CEL-I. Molecular replacement calculations were performed using the program AMoRe (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (26Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; : 26Google Scholar). The model was refined using the program CNS (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) with noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. Five percent of the reflections were set aside for Rfree calculations (32Brunger A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 366-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Manual fitting of the model was carried out by the program Xfit (33McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The final R and Rfree factors for all reflections between 52.7- and 2.0-Å resolution for native CEL-I were 0.140 and 0.179, respectively. The structure of the CEL-I-GalNAc complex was also solved by the molecular replacement method using the native CEL-I coordinates as a search model. The positions and orientations of GalNAc in the complex were clearly shown by the Fo - Fc difference Fourier map with a contour level of 3σ. The model was finally refined by the program REFMAC (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) without noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. The final R and Rfree factors between 33.8- and 1.7-Å resolution for the CEL-I-GalNAc complex were 0.158 and 0.186, respectively. The quality of the final models for native and complexed CEL-I was assessed by Ramachandran plots and analysis of the model geometry with the program PROCHECK (35Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D.

The rCEL-I gene was inserted into the pET-3a vector (Novagen), and used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). The proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies, which were solubilized with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 8 m urea and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The solubilized protein was purified by chromatography through a DEAE-Cellulofine column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 4 m urea and elution with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5 m. The rCEL-I was pooled and dialyzed against TBS, and the active protein was separated by affinity chromatography through a GalNAc-Cellulofine column (18Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H.

DNAs encoding mutant proteins, in which Arg115 and/or Gln70 were replaced by Ala (R115A, Q70A and Q70A/R115A), were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using two oligonucleotides (30mers) containing the mutation site and the plasmid containing wild-type rCEL-I DNA as a template. The mutant proteins were purified by the same procedure used for the wild-type protein. The N-terminal sequences of these proteins were confirmed using a Shimadzu PPSQ-21 protein sequencer. Hemagglutination Assay—Serial 2-fold dilutions of a sample (50 μl) were mixed with the same volume of a 5% (v/v) suspension of rabbit erythrocytes in the wells of round bottomed microtiter plates. Incubation was performed in TBS containing 10 mm CaCl2. The extent of agglutination was examined visually after incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The hemagglutinating activity was expressed as a titer, i.e. the reciprocal of the highest dilution producing detectable agglutination. Hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed by incubating 50-μl aliquots of the protein solutions (titer 2) containing various concentrations of carbohydrates with the same volume of a 5% (v/v) suspension of rabbit erythrocytes in TBS containing 10 mm CaCl2. The crystal structure of CEL-I was solved by the molecular replacement method using human lithostathine, which contains a CTLD (29Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as a search model. Native CEL-I is composed of one disulfide-linked homodimer (protomers A and B) in each asymmetric unit (Fig. 1). As shown in other C-type CRDs, the three-dimensional structure of CEL-I consists of two parts, a lower part composed of two α-helices (α1 and α2) and four β-strands (β0, β1, β1′, and β5), and an upper part composed of four β-strands (β2, β2′, β3, and β4), the latter of which contains the calcium-binding sites (Figs. 1 and 2). Regardless of the low sequence similarity (16–30%) with other C-type CRDs and CTLDs, structural comparison with known three-dimensional structures by DALI (37Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) revealed that CEL-I is very similar to long form CTLDs, such as lithostathine (Z = 21.6, r.m.s.d. of 1.7 Å for 128 Cα atoms), the H1 subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Z = 19.6, r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å for 118 Cα atoms), and tetranectin (Z = 19.5, r.m.s.d. of 2.1 Å for 132 Cα atoms). CEL-I also shows similarity with short form CTLDs, such as MBP-A (Z = 17.5, r.m.s.d. of 2.1 Å for 123 Cα atoms) and tunicate lectin TC14 (Z = 15.8, r.m.s.d. of 2.2 Å for 117 Cα atoms). Compared with other CRDs, CEL-I has an insertion (residues 36–41) between α1 and β1′ containing a 310 helix (residues 37–39) (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Ca2+-binding modes of CEL-I.

The colors for the secondary structures are the same as those described in the legend to Fig. 1. Conserved residues are illustrated in red. Conserved residues among both the galactose- and mannose-binding types and the galactose-binding type only of the C-type lectins are shown in yellow and orange, respectively.

The residues that coordinate with carbohydrate-binding Ca2+ ions are boxed in blue. This figure was drawn by the program ALSCRIPT (50Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) and manually modified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There are two intramolecular disulfide bonds in CEL-I (Cys3–Cys14 and Cys31–Cys135). The bond between Cys31 and Cys135 is equivalent to a widely conserved disulfide bond among CTLDs, whereas that between Cys3 and Cys14 is only observed in long form C-type CRDs (38Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). However, CEL-I does not have a disulfide bond connecting β3 and the loop between β4 and β5, which is well conserved in CTLDs. In CEL-I, the corresponding cysteine residues are replaced by Tyr111 and Ala127 (Fig. 3). The space resulting from the lack of this disulfide bond is filled by Tyr111, which may contribute to the stabilization of the protein structure instead of the corresponding disulfide bond. The two identical protomers of CEL-I are linked by an interchain disulfide bond between the Cys36 residues (Fig. 4A). In addition to this disulfide bond, there are several interactions between the two subunits around the N-terminal (residues 1–4), C-terminal (residues 137–140), and insertion loop (residues 36–41) (Fig. 5). Eight hydrogen bonds are present between the two protomers (Gln2–Gln2, Gln2–Gly11, Glu140–Thr5, Tyr34 (protomer A)–Thr38 (protomer B) and Thr38 (protomer A)–Ser35 (protomer B)). In particular, Gln2 appears to be especially important for dimeric interactions, because the Oϵ-1 and Nϵ-2 atoms of its side chain in one subunit make hydrogen bonds to the main-chain amide group of Gln2 and the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly11 in the other subunit, respectively (Fig. 5A). There are also hydrophobic interactions between the two subunits through Pro4, Leu39, Val41, Leu137, and Phe139 (Fig. 5B). Among the available C-type lectin crystal structures, only tunicate lectin TC14 has a homodimeric structure composed of two C-type CRDs (39Poget S.F. Legge G.B. Proctor M.R. Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The two subunits of the TC14 homodimer associate with each other through noncovalent interactions between β-strands and α-helices (Fig. 4B), because two N-terminal β-strands (β1) make an anti-parallel β-sheet, and two α-helices (α2) associate by hydrophobic interactions. Recently, another C-type CRD linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds has been reported in the decameric structure of rattlesnake venom lectin RSL (14Walker J.R. Nagar B. Young N.M. Hirama T. Rini J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3783-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the coagulation factor-binding proteins also form a disulfide-linked dimer composed of CTLDs, which have long loops to make dimeric interactions (40Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Koizumi M. Kano H.

They are bound in a similar way to those of MBP-A (6Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), lung surfactant protein D (42Kjell Håkansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B.

Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). CA1 is coordinated by the side chains of Asp77, Glu81, Asn104, and Asp110, the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Glu109, and one molecule of water (Fig. 2A). CA2 is coordinated by the side chains of Gln101, Asp103, Glu109, Asn123, and Asp124 and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp124 (Fig. 2B). In addition, two hydroxyl groups of MPD, used as a precipitant for crystallization, coordinate with CA2. They also form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Gln101, Asp103, Glu109, and Asn123, and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp124. CA3 shares the side chains of Glu81 and Asp110 with CA1, and the other ligands for CA3 are the main-chain carbonyl group of Gly93 in the symmetry-related protomer B (only for CA3 in protomer A) and three water molecules (Fig. 2A). There are two CEL-I homodimer molecules (the subunit structure is designated 1A/1B and 2A/2B for each molecule) in the asymmetric unit of the CEL-I-GalNAc complex crystal. Four bound GalNAc molecules coordinate to CA2 with their 3-OH and 4-OH in place of the two hydroxyl groups of MPD found in the native CEL-I crystal (Fig. 6A). These hydroxyl groups also form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Gln101, Asp103, Glu109, and Asn123. This binding mode is basically consistent with those of the carbohydrate complexes of MBP-C (9Ng K.K. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the GalNAc-binding mutant of MBP (10Kolatkar A.R. Leung A.K. Isecke R. Brossmer R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19502-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). Although the indole rings of Trp105 in protomers 1B and 2B are flipped relative to those in protomers 1A and 2A, because of the hydrogen-bonding with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Gln101 in the symmetry-related molecule of protomers 1B and 2B, the Trp105 residues in all protomers make van der Waals contact with the C-6 atom of GalNAc, thereby stabilizing the binding of GalNAc. Tryptophan residues have been found to stabilize the binding of carbohydrates in the Gal/GalNAc-recognizing C-type CRDs (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). However, the interaction between Trp105 and the C-6 atom of GalNAc appears to be relatively weak in the case of CEL-I, compared with that of Trp189 in the GalNAc-binding mutant of MBP, which makes van der Waals contacts with the C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 carbon atoms of GalNAc (Fig. 6B). In the mutant MBP, five residues (192–196) inserted as a glycine-rich loop (7Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appear to lead to closer contact between Trp189 and GalNAc. In the case of the CEL-I-GalNAc complex, there are two hydrogen bonds between the guanidium group of Arg115 and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetamido group of GalNAc (Fig. 6C). An arginine residue (Arg122) corresponding to Arg115 in CEL-I has been found in starfish (Asterina pectinifera) lectin, which also specifically binds to GalNAc (43Kakiuchi M. Okino N. Sueyoshi N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Kawabata S. Yamaguchi K. Ito M. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, the acetamido group of GalNAc also makes van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Gln70 and Asn123 (Fig. 6C). Therefore, these interactions are assumed to be closely related to the high affinity binding of GalNAc to CEL-I. CEL-I binds to the β-anomer of GalNAc, except for protomer 1B which preferentially binds the α-anomer because of a hydrogen bond between 1-OH of the bound GalNAc and Asp83 in protomer 2A. In protomers 1A and 2A, the terminal NH2 group of the side chain of Arg115 also makes a hydrogen bond with 1-OH of GalNAc, which preferentially stabilizes the binding of the β-anomer of GalNAc (Fig. 6C). Because Asn123 is essential as a ligand for CA2, we constructed mutants of rCEL-I, in which Arg115 and/or Gln70 were replaced by alanine (R115A, Q70A, and Q70A/R115A), to evaluate the contributions of these residues to GalNAc recognition. As reported previously, the wild-type rCEL-I expressed in E. coli cells exhibited a very similar, although slightly lower affinity, carbohydrate-binding specificity to the native protein in hemagglutination inhibition assays (36Hatakeyama T. Shiba K. Matsuo N. Fujimoto T. Oda T. Sugawara H. Aoyagi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the carbohydrate-binding specificity of the CEL-I mutants through the inhibition of hemagglutination by several simple carbohydrates. As shown in Table II, hemagglutination was inhibited by galactose-related carbohydrates in the wild-type as well as the mutant rCEL-I. In particular, GalNAc exhibited much stronger inhibition than the other carbohydrates (more than 250-fold in the case of the wild-type). However, inhibition by GalNAc decreased to ∼1/8, 1/32, and 1/64 for the R115A, Q70A, and Q70A/R115A mutants, respectively, compared with the wild-type. On the other hand, other galactose and galactose-containing carbohydrates showed only slight changes in their inhibitory profiles, compared with the wild-type. This confirms that Arg115 and Gln70 make significant contributions to the recognition of GalNAc. In particular, Gln70 appears to be more important than Arg115 despite hydrogen bonds between the latter and GalNAc. As shown in Table II, the Q70A/R115A mutant still had the same affinity for Gal as well as a moderately high affinity for GalNAc. This indicates that Gln70 and Arg115 have little influence on the recognition of the galactose moiety and also suggests that other residue(s), such as Asn123, may be involved in recognizing the acetamido group of GalNAc in addition to Gln70 and Arg115.Table IICarbohydrate-binding specificities of wild-type and mutant CEL-I, as evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition assay The values in parentheses denote the ratio to those for the wild-type.CarbohydrateMinimum concentration of carbohydrate to inhibit hemagglutinationWild-typeR115AQ70AQ70A/R115AmmGalNAc0.00310.0244 (8)0.0977 (32)0.195 (64)d-Galactose6.2525 (4)6.25 (1)NDaND, not determined.

Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and its complex structure with GalNAc was reported (10Kolatkar A.R. Leung A.K. Isecke R. Brossmer R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19502-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Its preferential affinity for GalNAc compared with that for Gal is achieved by van der Waals contact between the methyl group of the acetamido group of GalNAc and the Cϵ-1 and Nϵ-2 atoms of His202, which was introduced in place of threonine, the corresponding amino acid in rat hepatic lectin. This MBP mutant attained a 60-fold higher affinity for GalNAc than for Gal, indicating that such van der Waals interactions are very important. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, the orientation of GalNAc bound to CEL-I is very similar to that in the GalNAc-binding mutant of MBP. In the case of CEL-I, the methyl group of the acetamide of GalNAc makes van der Waals contact with Gln70 as mentioned above. Therefore, it appears that Gln70 may play a similar role to His202 in the GalNAc-binding mutant of MBP. On the other hand, Gln113, which is located at the corresponding position to His202 in the MBP mutant, may have the potential to interact with the methyl group of GalNAc, although a mutational analysis investigating this was not performed in the present study. CEL-I exhibits strong cytotoxicity (36Hatakeyama T. Shiba K. Matsuo N. Fujimoto T. Oda T. Sugawara H. Aoyagi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which suggests an actual biological role for this protein as a defense toxin against predators. The toxicity is inhibited in the presence of GalNAc suggesting that it is mediated by binding to specific carbohydrate chains on the cell surface. One probable mechanism is that the binding of CEL-I to cell surface carbohydrate chains triggers intracellular signaling, leading to cell death. An identification of the natural carbohydrate ligands for CEL-I that are present on the target cell surface seems to be important for understanding the cytotoxicity at the molecular level. Further investigation of the involvement of the residues around the carbohydrate-binding site of CEL-I using recombinant proteins should provide important clues regarding the recognition mechanism for natural ligands on the target cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W2096421326,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide mainly present in sensory nerve fibers, which is present in almost all organs, but it is also found in cultured rat type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEII). Our data have previously shown that CGRP may play an important role in inflammation as an immunomodulator. Proinflammatory factor IL-1beta induces CGRP release from neuron-derived sources. However, whether IL-1beta can induce CGRP secretion from a nonneural source, AEII cells, is not known. In the present study, we demonstrated that human AEII A549 cells expressed beta-CGRP, and IL-1beta (0.001-50 ng/ml) directly increased CGRP secretion from these cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The mRNA level of beta-CGRP was also elevated by IL-1beta (1 ng/ml). In addition, we found that IL-1beta-induced CGRP production was mediated through the PKC-p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Furthermore, IL-1beta-induced chemokines MCP-1 and IL-8 were partially inhibited by exogenous hCGRP (0.1-10 nM) and potentiated by hCGRP8-37 (0.1-10 nM), a CGRP1-receptor antagonist. In addition, the CGRP-inhibited chemokine effect was partially reduced by Rp-cAMP, a cAMP-PK inhibitor. These results suggest that AEII-derived CGRP may act in an autocrine/paracrine mode and play an important inhibitory role in the local area in lung inflammatory diseases."

Disruption of all four upstream AUGs (QM) results in 2–3-fold higher levels of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT<sub>1</sub>R) densities in transiently transfected rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A10 cells) and stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cells expressing QM have 5-fold higher levels of angiotensin II-induced inositol phosphate production than wild type (WT). Polysome analysis showed that QM mRNA is present in heavier fractions than the WT transcript, and 5.7-fold more AT<sub>1</sub>R protein is produced by <i>in vitro</i> translation from QM transcripts compared with WT transcripts. The AT<sub>1a</sub>R comprises 3 exons. Exon 3 (E3) encodes the entire open reading frame and 3′-untranslated region. Exons 1 and 2 (E1 and E2) and 52 nucleotides of E3 encode the 5′-LS. The AUGs in both exons contribute to the inhibitory effect on AT<sub>1</sub>R expression but not to the same degree. Disruption of the AUGs in exon 2 (DM2) relieves half of the inhibition, whereas disruption of the AUGs in exon 1 (DM1) is without effect. Disruption of the AUGs in exon 2 results in levels of receptor expression and translation that are indistinguishable from the alternative splice variant E1,3, which we previously showed was more efficiently translated than the E1,2,3 transcript. Individual mutations revealed that only the fourth AUG increased AT<sub>1</sub>R translation. In conclusion, all four AUGs present in the 5′-LS function cumulatively to suppress AT<sub>1a</sub>R expression and signaling by inhibiting translation. These data also show that both AUGs in E2 contribute to the inhibitory <i>cis</i> element present in this alternatively spliced exon."
