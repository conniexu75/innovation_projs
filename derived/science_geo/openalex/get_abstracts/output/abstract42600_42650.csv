https://openalex.org/W1656644300,"Tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, pp60v-src and pp110gag-fes was inhibited in vitro by an isoflavone genistein. The inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP and noncompetitive to a phosphate acceptor, histone H2B. By contrast, genistein scarcely inhibited the enzyme activities of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylase kinase, and the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C. When the effect of genistein on the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was examined in cultured A431 cells, EGF-stimulated serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased. Phosphoamino acid analysis of total cell proteins revealed that genistein inhibited the EGF-stimulated increase in phosphotyrosine level in A431 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2041647537,"Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and B cell stimulatory factor-1 (BSF-1), also known as interleukin-4, are T cell-derived lymphokines that have potent effects on B cell proliferation and differentiation. They are often secreted by distinct T cell clones. It is now shown that IFN-gamma stimulates the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) of the IgG2a isotype and inhibits the production of IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgE. By contrast, BSF-1 has powerful effects in promoting switching to the expression of IgG1 and IgE but markedly inhibits IgM, IgG3, IgG2a, and IgG2b. These results indicate that BSF-1 and IFN-gamma as well as the T cells that produce them may act as reciprocal regulatory agents in the determination of Ig isotype responses. The effects of IFN-gamma and BSF-1 on isotype expression are independent."

The families also gave no evidence for heterogeneity, indicating that a significant proportion of NF cases are due to mutations at a single locus. Further genetic analysis can now refine this localization and may lead to the eventual identification and cloning of the defective gene responsible for this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2039028257,"CD4 functions as the cell-surface receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); however, the mechanism of virus entry into susceptible cells is unknown. To explore this question we used a human T lymphoblastic cell line (VB) expressing high levels of surface CD4. Neutralization of endosomal compartments (pH greater than 6.4) with lysosomotropic agents did not effectively inhibit HIV nucleocapsid entry into the cytoplasm, and virus treated at low pH (5.5) failed to induce rapid cell-to-cell fusion in uninfected cells. Electron microscopy of VB cells acutely exposed to HIV at neutral pH revealed direct fusion of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane within minutes at 4 degrees C. No endocytosed virions were visualized upon rewarming the HIV-exposed cells to 37 degrees C for as long as 60 min. These results indicate that HIV penetrates CD4-positive T cells via pH-independent membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1992707199,"B lymphocytes bearing the Leu-1 cell-surface antigen (Leu-1+), the human equivalent of mouse Ly-1+ B lymphocytes, have been detected in human peripheral blood, but there is little information on their frequency and properties. Analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and double immunofluorescence showed that Leu-1+ B cells are consistently present in the peripheral blood and spleens of healthy subjects and constitute 17.0 +/- 5.0% (mean value +/- standard deviation) and 17.3 +/- 3.9%, respectively, of total B cells. When purified Leu-1+ and Leu-1- B lymphocytes were transformed into immunoglobulin-secreting cells by infection with Epstein-Barr virus and the culture fluids were tested for reactivity with self-antigens, at least two important autoantibodies, antibody to the Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin G (rheumatoid factor) and antibody to single-stranded DNA, were found to be made exclusively by Leu-1+ B cells. It is concluded that the Leu-1+ lymphocytes represent a major subset of the normal human B cell repertoire and include the B cells capable of making autoantibodies similar to those found in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2017995506,"Mutations in gurken and torpedo cause a ventralization in the follicle cell epithelium during Drosophila oogenesis and in the pattern of the embryo that develops in the resultant egg. Both genes lie midway in an epistatic series between fs(1)K10 and dorsal; the mutations block the dorsalization normally observed in K10 eggs but have no effect on the phenotype of embryos derived from dorsal mothers. Analysis of germ-line mosaics demonstrates that both ovarian and embryonic phenotypes will be produced when either the gurken+ gene is removed from the germ line or torpedo+ is removed from the soma. This shows that the dorsoventral pattern of the Drosophila egg chamber depends on the transfer of spatial information from the germ line to the somatic follicle cells, and from somatic cells to the oocyte."

https://openalex.org/W1574035164,"In a previous publication (Narhi, L. O. and Fulco, A. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7160-7169) we described the characterization of a soluble 119,000-dalton P-450 cytochrome (P-450BM-3) that was induced by barbiturates in Bacillus megaterium. This single polypeptide contained 1 mol each of FAD and FMN/mol of heme and, in the presence of NADPH and O2, catalyzed the oxygenation of long-chain fatty acids without the aid of any other protein. We have now utilized limited trypsin proteolysis in the presence of substrate to cleave P-450BM-3 into two polypeptides (domains) of about 66,000 and 55,000 daltons. The 66-kDa domain contains both FAD and FMN but no heme, reduces cytochrome c in the presence of NADPH, and is derived from the C-terminal portion of P-450BM-3. The 55-kDa domain is actually a mixture of three discrete peptides (T-I, T-II, and T-III) separable by high performance liquid chromatography. All three contain heme and show a P-450 absorption peak in the presence of CO and dithionite. The major component, T-I (Mr = 55 kDa), binds fatty acid substrate and has an N-terminal amino acid sequence identical to that of intact P-450BM-3, an indication that this domain constitutes the N-terminal portion of the 119-kDa protein. T-II (54 kDa) is the same as T-I except that it is missing the first nine N-terminal amino acids and does not bind substrate. T-III (Mr = 53.5 kDa) has lost the first 15 N-terminal residues and does not bind substrate. Since trypsin digestion of P-450BM-3 carried out in the absence of substrate yields T-II and T-III but no T-I, it appears that 1 or more residues of the first nine N-terminal amino acids of this protein are intimately involved in substrate binding. Although both the heme- and flavin-containing tryptic peptides retain their original half-reactions, fatty acid monooxygenase activity cannot be reconstituted after proteolysis, and the two domains, once separated, show no affinity for each other. In most respects, the reductase domain of P-450BM-3 more closely resembles the mammalian microsomal P-450 reductases than it does any known bacterial protein."
https://openalex.org/W1966384509,"A small RNA of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi 29 is shown to have a novel and essential role in viral DNA packaging in vitro. This requirement for RNA in the encapsidation of viral DNA provides a new dimension of complexity to the attendant protein-DNA interactions. The RNA is a constituent of the viral precursor shell of the DNA-packaging machine but is not a component of the mature virion. Studies of the sequential interactions involving this RNA molecule are likely to provide new insight into the structural and possible catalytic roles of small RNA molecules. The phi 29 assembly in extracts and phi 29 DNA packaging in the defined in vitro system were strongly inhibited by treatment with the ribonucleases A or T1. However, phage assembly occurred normally in the presence of ribonuclease A that had been treated with a ribonuclease inhibitor. An RNA of approximately 120 nucleotides co-purified with the phi 29 precursor protein shell (prohead), and this particle was the target of ribonuclease action. Removal of RNA from the prohead by ribonuclease rendered it inactive for DNA packaging. By RNA-DNA hybridization analysis, the RNA was shown to originate from a viral DNA segment very near the left end of the genome, the end packaged first during in vitro assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2079725260,"Antibody-producing cells display a special form of regulation whereby each cell produces immunoglobulin from only one of its two sets of antibody genes. This phenomenon, called allelic exclusion, is thought to be mediated by the product of one heavy chain allele restricting the expression of the other. Heavy chains are synthesized in two molecular forms, secreted and membrane bound. In order to determine whether it is specifically the membrane-bound form of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy chain (μ) that mediates this regulation, transgenic mice were created that carry a human μ chain gene altered so that it can only direct the synthesis of the membrane-bound protein. The membrane-bound form of the human μ chain was made by most of the B cells in these animals as measured by assays of messenger RNA and surface immunoglobulins. Further, the many B cells that express the human gene do not express endogenous mouse IgM, and the few B cells that express endogenous mouse μ do not express the transgene. Thus, the membrane-bound form of the μ chain is sufficient to mediate allelic exclusion. In addition, the molecular structures recognized for this purpose are conserved between human and mouse systems."
https://openalex.org/W1504479686,"Effects of changes in intracellular ion concentrations on the interactions of Escherichia coli lac repressor with lac operator mutants and on the interactions of RNA polymerase with various promoters have been investigated in vivo. The intracellular ionic environment was reproducibly varied by changing the osmolality of the 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid minimal growth medium. As the osmolality of the growth medium is varied from 0.1 to 1.1 osmolal, the total intracellular concentration of K+ increases linearly from 0.23 +/- 0.03 to 0.93 +/- 0.05 molal and the total intracellular concentration of glutamate increases linearly from 0.03 +/- 0.01 to 0.26 +/- 0.02 molal. The sum of the changes in the total concentrations of these two ions appears sufficient to compensate for a given change in external osmolality, indicating that K+ and glutamate are the primary ionic osmolytes under these conditions and that these ions are free in the cytoplasm. In support of this, in vivo 39K NMR experiments as a function of external osmolality indicate that changes in the total cytoplasmic K+ concentration correspond to changes in the free cytoplasmic K+ concentration. Extents of interaction of lac repressor and RNA polymerase with their specific DNA sites were monitored by measuring the amounts of beta-galactosidase produced under the control of these sites. For both lac repressor and RNA polymerase, it was found that formation of functional protein-DNA complexes in vivo is only weakly (if at all) dependent on intracellular ion concentration. These results contrast strongly with those obtained on these systems in vitro, which showed that both the equilibria and kinetics of binding are extremely salt-dependent. We discuss several possible mechanisms by which E. coli may compensate for the potentially disruptive effects of these large changes in the intracellular ionic environment."
https://openalex.org/W1964870672,"LEP100 (an integral membrane glycoprotein, Mr = 100,000) occurs in three subcellular compartments: lysosome (approximately 90% of the molecules), endosome (5%-8%), and plasma membrane (2%-3%). Rate constants for movement to and from each compartment have been estimated. The movement of LEP100 from endosomes to lysosomes was blocked by chloroquine, causing redistribution to a new steady state in which about 30% of LEP100 molecules were localized in clathrin-coated patches on the cell surface, while intracellular LEP100 occurred in nearby endocytic vesicles. The cell-surface and endosomal pools of LEP100 remained in rapid equilibrium (t1/2 about 5 min). These results support the existence of a hitherto unappreciated pathway of membrane flow from lysosomes. The lysosome should not be considered simply a terminal target of membrane trafficking."

https://openalex.org/W1604766895,"The peroxidase activity of prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase catalyzes reduction of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl hydroperoxide to 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl alcohol with a turnover number of approximately 8000 mol of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl hydroperoxide/mol of enzyme/min. The kinetics and products of reaction establish PGH synthase as a classical heme peroxidase with catalytic efficiency similar to horseradish peroxidase. This suggests that the protein of PGH synthase evolved to facilitate peroxide heterolysis by the heme prosthetic group. Comparison of an extensive series of phenols, aromatic amines, beta-dicarbonyls, naturally occurring compounds, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indicates that considerable differences exist in their ability to act as reducing substrates. No correlation is observed between the ability of compounds to support peroxidatic hydroperoxide reduction and to inhibit cyclooxygenase. In addition, the resolved enantiomers of MK-410 and etodolac exhibit dramatic enantiospecific differences in their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase but are equally potent as peroxidase-reducing substrates. This suggests that there are significant differences in the orientation of compounds at cyclooxygenase inhibitory sites and the peroxidase oxidation site(s). Comparison of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl hydroperoxide reduction by PGH synthase and horseradish peroxidase reveals considerable differences in reducing substrate specificity. Both the cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities of PGH synthase inactivate in the presence of low micromolar amounts of hydroperoxides and arachidonic acid. PGH synthase was most sensitive to arachidonic acid, which exhibited an I50 of 0.6 microM in the absence of all protective agents. Inactivation by hydroperoxides requires peroxidase turnover and can be prevented by reducing substrates. The I50 values for inactivation by 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid are 4.0 and 92 microM, respectively, in the absence and presence of 500 microM phenol, a moderately good reducing substrate. The ability of compounds to protect against hydroperoxide-induced inactivation correlates directly with their ability to act as reducing substrates. Hydroquinone, an excellent reducing substrate, protected against hydroperoxide-induced inactivation when present in less than 3-fold molar excess over hydroperoxide. The presence of a highly efficient hydroperoxide-reducing activity appears absolutely essential for protection of the cyclooxygenase capacity of PGH synthase. The peroxidase activity is, therefore, a twin-edged sword, responsible for and protective against hydroperoxide-dependent inactivation of PGH synthase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2009553840,"The mechanisms whereby insulin increases diacylglycerol in BC3H-1 myocytes were examined. When [3H]arachidonate labeling of phospholipids was used as an indicator of phospholipase C activation, transient increases in [3H]diacylglycerol were observed between 0.5 and 10 minutes after the onset of insulin treatment. With [3H]glycerol labeling as an indicator of de novo phospholipid synthesis, [3H]diacylglycerol was increased maximally at 1 minute and remained elevated for 20 minutes. [3H]Glycerol-labeled diacylglycerol was largely derived directly from phosphatidic acid. Insulin increased de novo phosphatidic acid synthesis within 5 to 10 seconds; within 1 minute, this synthesis was 60 times greater than that of controls. Thus, the initial increase in diacylglycerol is due to both increased hydrolysis of phospholipids and a burst of de novo phosphatidic acid synthesis. After 5 to 10 minutes, de novo phosphatidic acid synthesis continues as a major source of diacylglycerol. Both phospholipid effects of insulin seem important for generating diacylglycerol and other phospholipid-derived intracellular signaling substances."
https://openalex.org/W2006822971,"It has been proposed that aluminum ion is a contributing factor in a variety of neurological diseases. In many of these diseases, aberrations in the cytoskeleton have been noted. The effects of aluminum ion on the in vitro assembly of tubulin into microtubules has been examined by determining the association constants for the metal ion-guanosine triphosphate-tubulin ternary complex required for polymerization. The association constant for aluminum ion was approximately 10(7) times that of magnesium ion, the physiological mediator of microtubule assembly. In addition, aluminum ion at 4.0 X 10(-10) mole per liter competed effectively with magnesium ion for support of tubulin polymerization when magnesium ion falls below 1.0 millimole per liter. The microtubules produced by aluminum ion were indistinguishable from those produced by magnesium ion when viewed by electron microscopy, and they showed identical critical tubulin concentrations for assembly and sensitivities to cold-induced depolymerization. However, the rate of guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis and the sensitivity to calcium ion-induced depolymerization, critical regulatory processes of microtubules in vivo, were markedly lower for aluminum ion microtubules than for magnesium ion microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2089549234,"When rat skeletal muscle cells were treated with EGTA, an inhibitor of cell fusion, a battery of muscle-specific mRNAs was synthesized but not translated despite the synthesis of many other proteins. Most of the muscle-specific mRNAs were associated with polysomes in fused myotubes, whereas they were found in postpolysomal fractions in EGTA-treated cells. Therefore, in addition to the well-documented transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of muscle-specific genes, translational control of this specific group of genes, presumably involving a Ca2+-dependent process, is also observed in these fusion-blocked cells. These findings and results obtained with other fusion inhibitors demonstrate that three types of muscle-specific gene expression take place in the fusion-blocked cells depending on the inhibitors used: one, neither muscle-specific mRNAs nor proteins are synthesized; two, the mRNAs are synthesized but not translated; and three, both the mRNAs and the proteins are synthesized."
https://openalex.org/W1508418323,"To locate functional domains of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) protein, a cDNA clone encoding biologically active human IL-2 was mutagenized using synthetic oligonucleotides to incorporate defined amino acid substitutions and deletions in the mature protein. The IL-2 analogs were then produced in Escherichia coli and assayed for the ability to induce proliferation of IL-2-dependent cells and the ability to compete for binding to the IL-2 receptor. Our analysis of over 50 different mutations demonstrated that the integrity of at least three regions of the IL-2 molecule is required for full biological activity: the NH2 terminus (residues 1-20), the COOH terminus (residues 121-133), and 2 of the 3 cysteine residues (58 and 105). Deletion of the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids or the COOH-terminal 10 amino acids resulted in the loss of greater than 99% of bioactivity and binding. Amino acid substitutions at specific positions in these regions also resulted in proteins which retained less than 1% activity. The NH2 terminus and an adjacent internal region were recognized by neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies. In combination with the results from epitope competition analysis with neutralizing antibodies, these data are consistent with the IL-2 protein being folded such that the NH2 terminus, the COOH terminus, and the internal 30- to 60-region are juxtaposed to form the binding site recognized by the IL-2 receptor."

Small patches of homozygous arm cells induced by mitotic recombination also form such denticles, indicating that the changes in cellular fate observed in homozygous arm embryos are autonomous at the level of single cells. Clonally derived arm patches do not, however, show the characteristic arm polarity reversals, arguing that this feature of the phenotype depends on cell interactions in fully mutant embryos. Few, if any, clones were found in the posterior-most regions of the naked cuticle, and none were found in the posterior compartments of the thorax."

Two mutants, constructed by in vitro site-specific mutagenesis of Lys158 in rscu-PA to Gly158 (rscu-PA-Gly158) or to Glu158 (rscu-PA-Glu158), were also expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Wild type and mutant rscu-PAs were purified to homogeneity by immunoadsorption on an insolubilized monoclonal antibody raised against natural scu-PA (nscu-PA), followed by gel filtration. The specific activity of the mutant scu-PAs on fibrin plates is very low (less than 1,000 IU/mg) compared to that of the wild type rscu-PA (44,000 IU/mg). The mutants, in contrast to the wild type rscu-PA, are not converted to amidolytically active two chain u-PA (tcu-PA) by plasmin and do not cause lysis of a 125I-fibrin-labeled plasma clot immersed in citrated plasma. However, in a purified system, both rscu-PA-Gly158 and rscu-PA-Glu158 activate plasminogen following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a much lower affinity (Km = 60-80 microM) but with a higher turnover rate constant (k2 = 0.01 s-1) as compared to the wild type rscu-PA (Km = 1.0 microM, k2 = 0.002 s-1). We conclude that conversion of scu-PA to tcu-PA is not a prerequisite for the activation of plasminogen. Substitution of Lys158 by Gly158 or Glu158 does, however, markedly decrease the stability of the Michaelis complex."
https://openalex.org/W1559320406,"Recent work has shown that oocytes of the starfish synthesize (8R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and that this eicosanoid has a potent and highly specific action in induction of oocyte maturation. These striking results prompted us to examine the lipoxygenase activity of eggs of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Four hydroxyeicosanoids were formed in homogenates of sea urchin eggs; their structures and stereochemistry were characterized by high pressure liquid chromatography, UV spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The compounds were identified as (11R)-hydroxy-5,8,12,14-ZZEZ-eicosatetraenoic acid and (12R)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-ZZEZ-eicosatetraenoic acid (from arachidonic acid) and the corresponding (11R)- and (12R)-hydroxy analogs of eicosapentaenoic acid. The formation of these egg products was not blocked by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 microM), and their precise structures are consistent with their formation by a lipoxygenase reaction. Eicosapentaenoic acids with a prochiral tritium label in the 10-D or 10-L position were used to investigate the mechanism of biosynthesis. The formation of (12R)-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid proceeded with the stereoselective abstraction of the 10-D hydrogen from the substrate. This reaction was shown to be opposite to the (12S) oxygenation catalyzed by porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase. These results with S. purpuratus eggs constitute the first demonstration of (11R)- or (12R)-lipoxygenase activity in any cell type or tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1657881138,"In a previous publication (Narhi, L. O., and Fulco, A. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7160-7169) we described the characterization of a 119,000-dalton P-450 cytochrome that is strongly induced by barbiturates in Bacillus megaterium. In the presence of NADPH and O2, this single polypeptide can catalyze the hydroxylation of long-chain fatty acids without the aid of any other protein. The gene encoding this unique monooxygenase (cytochrome P-450BM-3) has now been cloned by an immunochemical screening technique. The Escherichia coli clone harboring the recombinant plasmid produces a 119,000-dalton protein that appears to be electrophoretically and immunochemically identical to the B. megaterium enzyme and contains the same N-terminal amino acid sequence. The recombinant DNA product also exhibits the characteristic cytochrome P-450 spectrum and is fully functional as a fatty acid monooxygenase. In E. coli, the synthesis of P-450BM-3 is directed by its own promoter included in the DNA insert and proceeds constitutively at a very high rate but is not stimulated by pentobarbital. However, when the cloned P-450BM-3 gene, either intact or in a truncated form, is introduced back into B. megaterium via an E. coli/Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector, its expression is constitutively repressed but is induced by pentobarbital. This finding demonstrates that the regulatory region of the P-450BM-3 gene that responds to barbiturates is included in the cloned DNA. The evidence also indicates that pentobarbital cannot directly act on the gene to cause induction but presumably interacts with another component such as a repressor molecule that is present in B. megaterium but is absent in the E. coli clone."
https://openalex.org/W1545293919,"In previous studies, we have shown that the stretch 148-197 of the fibrinogen A alpha chain plays a crucial role in the acceleration of the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)-catalyzed plasminogen activation. In this study we have synthesized parts of A alpha 148-197 and analogues thereof. We found that the peptides with sequences identical with A alpha 148-161 and A alpha 149-161 of human fibrinogen accelerate the plasminogen activation by t-PA, whereas the corresponding peptides in which lysine residues A alpha 157 had been replaced by valine or arginine had no accelerating capacity. Furthermore, succinylation of the lysine residue(s) in the synthesized peptides A alpha 148-161 and A alpha 149-161 leads to loss of accelerating action. These findings show that lysine residue A alpha 157 is crucial for the accelerating action of fibrin on the t-PA-catalyzed plasminogen activation."
https://openalex.org/W1658518175,"We have tested the hypothesis that the mechanism of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and phorbol diester action to decrease the apparent affinity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) phosphorylation site, threonine 654. Protein kinase C-deficient cells were prepared by prolonged incubation of human fibroblasts with phorbol diester. Addition of phorbol diesters to these cells fails to regulate EGF receptor affinity or threonine 654 phosphorylation. In contrast, PDGF treatment of both control and protein kinase C-deficient fibroblasts causes a decrease in the apparent affinity of the EGF receptor and an increase in threonine 654 phosphorylation. Thus, the ability of PDGF or phorbol diester to modulate EGF receptor affinity occurs only when threonine 654 phosphorylation is increased. The stoichiometry of threonine 654 phosphorylation associated with a 50% decrease in the binding of 125I-EGF to high affinity sites was 0.15 versus 0.3 mol of phosphate per mole of EGF receptor when 32P-labeled fibroblasts are treated with PDGF or phorbol diester, respectively. It is concluded that EGF receptor phosphorylation at threonine 654 can be regulated by PDGF independently of protein kinase C, substoichiometric phosphorylation of the total EGF receptor pool at threonine 654 is caused by maximally effective concentrations of PDGF, and different extents of phosphorylation of EGF receptors at threonine 654 are observed for maximally effective concentrations of PDGF and phorbol diester, respectively. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that a specific subpopulation of EGF receptors that exhibit high affinity for EGF are regulated by threonine 654 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1574593230,"Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used to examine the role of insulin receptor phosphorylation in the regulation of insulin receptor internalization in vascular endothelial cells. Association of 125I-insulin in rat capillary and bovine aortic endothelial cells preincubated with PMA was increased by 80 and 64% over control, respectively. The increase was due to enhanced 125I-insulin internalization as opposed to an effect on surface-bound hormone. PMA had no significant effect on 125I-insulin degradation or on release of internalized insulin from the cells. Internalization of 125I-labeled insulin receptor was determined by the resistance of labeled receptor to trypsinization. At 10 degrees C, nearly all of the labeled receptor was sensitive to removal by trypsin, indicating that it was exposed on the cell surface. Exposure of labeled cells to insulin (100 nM) at 37 degrees C resulted in the rapid appearance of trypsin-resistant insulin receptor, indicating receptor internalization. Steady state for receptor internalization was attained at 10-15 min. When surfaced-labeled cells were preincubated with PMA at 37 degrees C, the rate of insulin receptor internalization was increased by 3.6 +/- 0.2-fold and 2.1 +/- 0.5-fold at 1 and 5 min of insulin exposure, respectively (ED50 at 16 nM PMA). This effect of PMA was associated with an increase in serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Thus, PMA increased insulin internalization in the endothelial cells by modulating the insulin-induced internalization of the receptor. The additive effects of PMA and insulin on insulin receptor phosphorylation suggest that the phorbol ester and insulin act via independent signaling mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1792151919,"Abstract Stimulation of secretion in guinea pig exocrine cells is associated with an enhanced synthesis in these cells of 1-O-alkyl-2-sn-acetyl-glycero-3-phosphocholines (PAF) from 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PAF) (Soling, H-D., and Fest, W. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13916-13922). This results from a stimulation of the activity of lyso-1-alkylglycerophosphocholine acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.67). Here we have analyzed the effects of various agonists on the activity of this enzyme in guinea pig parotid gland microsomes. Carbamoylcholine leads within less than 30 s to a 2- to 4-fold activation of lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase, which persists after solubilization of the microsomal enzyme with octyl glucoside. The calcium ionophore A23187 has a similar though smaller effect. Neither isoproterenol (2 X 10(-5) M), which stimulates exocytosis more than carbachol, nor phorbol ester significantly affected lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase activity. Incubation of microsomes from unstimulated parotid gland acini with cAMP-dependent and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase resulted in a 4-fold and 2.9-fold activation of lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase activity, respectively. Protein kinase C had no significant effect. Activation with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was inhibited by 40 microM trifluoperazine. When microsomes from carbachol-stimulated glands were used, in vitro activation of the enzyme by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was almost abolished. Protein phosphatase 2A in vitro strongly reduced lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase activity in microsomes from both stimulated and unstimulated glands, whereas alkaline phosphatase and protein phosphatase 1 had only small effects. Following treatment with protein phosphatase 2A, enzyme activity in microsomes from stimulated glands could be enhanced more than 8-fold by subsequent incubation with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Although unsuccessful attempts have made it impossible so far to demonstrate directly the incorporation of phosphate into lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase, the results reported here strongly suggest that the enzyme in exocrine cells is regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation and that a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is responsible for the activation of the enzyme and type-2 protein phosphatases for its inactivation."

A specialized extracellular matrix, basement membrane, is built around a scaffold of procollagen IV molecules. We report the sequence of a 2.5-kilobase cDNA which contains the carboxyl end of a Drosophila melanogaster procollagen IV. The amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal domain, which forms an essential intermolecular linkage between procollagen IV molecules, is 59% identical in Drosophila and vertebrate procollagens IV, and an additional 17% of residues are conservatively substituted. This implies that the nature of the linkage is also conserved. We suggest that intermolecular junctions through procollagen IV carboxyl domains are fundamental elements of the molecular architecture of Metazoan basement membranes and have been conserved during evolution. The isolation and identification of this basement membrane collagen gene of Drosophila will help in deducing the function of procollagen IV in basement membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1505864298,"Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with specific lesions in the formation of glycoconjugates were tested for their sensitivity to lysis by interferon-boosted human natural killer cells. We report here that the type of asparagine-linked carbohydrate present on target cell glycoproteins determines their susceptibility to natural killer lysis. The targets tested were Chinese hamster ovary parent cells and Lec1, Lec2, and Lec8 mutants. Lec8 and Lec2 cells show an overall reduction of galactose and/or sialic acid in their glycoconjugates due to defects in the translocation of UDP-galactose and CMP-sialic acid, respectively. Due to a specific block in N-linked carbohydrate processing, Lec1 cells produce only high mannose-type oligosaccharides, but their glycolipids are identical to those of the parent. Both Lec2 and Lec8 mutants are more sensitive to natural killer lysis than the parent cells. This is consistent with their extensive reduction in cell surface sialic acid. Furthermore, Lec1 mutants are more susceptible to natural killer lysis than the parent cells. To confirm that the increased natural killer sensitivity of Lec1 cells was due to the modification of N-linked carbohydrate, parent cells were treated with swainsonine, a specific inhibitor of N-linked oligosaccharide processing. Swainsonine-treated parent cells are nearly as sensitive to natural killer lysis as the Lec1 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1547219449,"Swainsonine is a potent inhibitor of lysosomal alpha-D-mannosidase, causes the production of hybrid glycoproteins, and is reported to produce a phenocopy of hereditary alpha-mannosidosis. We now report that the effects of swainsonine administration in the rat are different in two respects from those found in other animals thus far studied. Swainsonine caused the accumulation of oligosaccharide in kidney and urine but not in liver or brain. The accumulated oligosaccharides were mainly Man(alpha 1-3)[Man(alpha 1-6)]Man(beta 1-4)GlcNAc, Man(alpha 1-3)[Man(alpha 1-6)[Man(alpha 1-3)]Man(beta 1-4) GlcNAc, and Man(alpha 1-3)[Man(alpha 1-6)]Man(alpha 1-6)[Man(alpha 1-3)]Man(beta 1-4)GlcNAc. Analogous branched Man4 and Man5 structures are found in pig and sheep tissues, but they are N, N'-diacetylchitobiose derivatives. The substrate specificities of rat kidney lysosomal and cytosolic alpha-D-mannosidases were investigated because in one type of hereditary alpha-mannosidosis, that occurring in man, the major storage products are linear rather than branched oligosaccharides. The lysosomal enzyme showed much greater activity toward linear oligosaccharides than toward the branched oligosaccharides induced in the kidney by swainsonine. On the other hand, cytosolic alpha-D-mannosidase preferred the branched oligosaccharides, a result suggesting that this mannosidase might be inhibitable by swainsonine and that the enzyme might play a normal role in glycoprotein catabolism. Swainsonine was indeed found to inhibit this enzyme at relatively high concentrations (I50 at 100 microM swainsonine), and concentrations of this magnitude were in fact found in the cytosol of kidney of swainsonine-fed rats. The kidney cytosolic alpha-D-mannosidase levels were reduced in these rats and, more important, the accumulated oligosaccharides were present mainly in the cytosol rather than in lysosomes. These results point to possible involvement of cytosolic alpha-D-mannosidase in glycoprotein degradation in the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1499326065,"To determine the functional role of the metal-dependent conformational changes in Factor IX, two populations of conformation-specific anti-Factor IX antibodies were prepared. Anti-Factor IX X Mg(II) antibodies bind to Factor IX in the presence of Mg(II) and other metal ions, but not in the absence of metal ions. Anti-Factor IX X Ca(II)-specific antibodies bind to Factor IX in the presence of Ca(II) and Sr(II), but not in the presence of Mn(II), Mg(II), and Ba(II). In the presence of a metal ion that induces the conformational transition recognized by the anti-Factor IX X Mg(II) antibodies, the concentrations of CaCl2 and SrCl2 needed for the half-maximal binding of the anti-Factor IX X Ca(II)-specific antibodies to Factor IX were reduced 3- and 20-fold, respectively. Factor IX binding to phospholipid vesicles was inhibited by the Fab fragments of the anti-Factor IX X Ca(II)-specific antibodies, but was not inhibited by the Fab fragments of the anti-Factor IX X Mg(II) antibodies. Factor XIa activation of Factor IX was also inhibited by the Fab fragments of the anti-Factor IX X Ca(II)-specific antibodies, but not by the anti-Factor IX X Mg(II) antibodies. These results support the hypothesis that Factor IX undergoes two metal-dependent conformational transitions: FIX----FIX'----FIX*. The first transition (FIX----FIX') is metal-dependent but cation-nonselective; the second transition (FIX'----FIX*) is metal-selective for Ca(II) or Sr(II). The second transition results in the expression of conformational determinants necessary for membrane binding and the Ca(II)-dependent activation of Factor IX by Factor XIa. These results suggest chemical similarity between a surface of a domain of Factor XIa and phospholipid vesicles, both of which interact with Factor IX in the presence of Ca(II)."
https://openalex.org/W1577607250,"Analog inhibition studies of the uptake of proline, serine, and threonine into human fibroblast lysosomes, purified on Percoll gradients, reveal the presence of three new transport systems. These systems fail to show the Na+ requirement usual for the plasma membrane. Proline uptake into fibroblast lysosomes occurs mainly by two routes: a predominant route half-saturating at 0.01 mM, and a lower-affinity route, half-saturating at 0.07 mM. The latter so far appears specific for L-proline and its 3,4-dehydro derivative. The high affinity route has a broad scope, recognizing best, beyond these two amino acids, various unbranched neutral amino acids not over 5 carbons long. Neither system accepts to a significant extent D-proline, hydroxyproline, cationic or anionic amino acids, nor neutral ones with bulky side chains. 2-Aminoisobutyrate and its N-methyl derivative have little effect on proline uptake, in contrast to their effectiveness on its uptake by the intact fibroblast. The rate of lysosomal proline uptake maximizes at about pH 6.4, is inversely related to the osmolarity of the medium, and is unaffected by the extralysosomal presence of MgATP. The competition among alanine, serine, and threonine points to sharing of the broad-scope system for proline, although the main part of their uptake occurs by a third route that rejects amino acids in which the alpha-amino group is methylated."

Polyamines, such as spermidine and spermine, are also good substrates for this enzyme. The pH optimum for aminoacetone oxidation was found to be 8.2. The apparent Km values of the enzyme for aminoacetone and spermidine were 0.009 and 0.095 mM, respectively. The subunit molecular weight of the enzyme was 93,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme was 186,000 by gel filtration. The enzyme is highly sensitive to carbonyl group reagents. The enzyme is not inhibited by monoamine and diamine oxidase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1599563761,"Irradiation of erythrocyte ghosts in the presence of [3H]forskolin resulted in a concentration-dependent, covalent incorporation of radiolabel into several of the major membrane protein bands. Most of the incorporation occurred in four regions of the gel. Peak 1 (216 kDa) was a sharp peak near the top of the gel in the region corresponding to spectrin. Peak 2 appeared to be associated with band 3 (89 kDa), while a third peak occurred around the position of band 4.2 (76 kDa). The fourth region of labeling was a broad area between 43-75 kDa which corresponds to the region of the glucose transporter. Forskolin labeling of this region was inhibited by cytochalasin B and D-glucose, but not L-glucose. Extraction of extrinsic membrane proteins resulted in a loss of radiolabeled protein from the 216- and 76-kDa regions. Treatment of membranes labeled with either cytochalasin B or forskolin with endo-beta-galactosidase resulted in identical shifts of the 43 to 75-kDa peaks to 42 kDa. Similarly, trypsinization of membranes photolabeled with either cytochalasin B or forskolin resulted in the generation of a 17-kDa radiolabeled fragment in both cases. Photoincorporation of [3H]cytochalasin B into the glucose transporter was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled forskolin."
https://openalex.org/W1954391546,"N-Carbamoyl-beta-alanine (NC beta A) amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.6) is regulated in opposing fashion by the substrate, NC beta A and the product, beta-alanine. The native enzyme from rat liver has a molecular weight of 235,000 in the absence of ligands. NC beta A and substrate analogs (N-amidino-beta-alanine, N-carbamoyl-glycine) produced association of the enzyme. beta-Alanine and its analog gamma-aminobutyrate caused dissociation of the enzyme and produced inhibition. Negative cooperativity was observed for the binding of all ligands as measured by the change in polymerization of the enzyme, with an average Hill coefficient (napp) of 0.5. Enzyme that had been dissociated by preincubation with beta-alanine had little or no initial activity; only after a lag of 9 s was a steady state progress curve evident. The existence of a regulatory site is proposed as a model to explain physical and kinetic data. The enzyme activity was highest in rat liver and detectable in kidney; activity was not detected in brain, lung, muscle, or spleen of rat, nor in mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The rat liver enzyme has a pH optimum of 6.8, with a Km of 6.5 microM for NC beta A and a Ki of 1.08 mM for beta-alanine at this pH."
https://openalex.org/W1594597043,"To elucidate possible functions of elevation of endogenous diacylglycerol induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone in pituitary cells, we have studied the actions of two synthetic diacylglycerols, sn-1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), on cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in GH4C1 cells. OAG induced an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i which gradually reached a peak that was twice the basal level after the first min; [Ca2+]i then returned to remain at basal level after 3 min. The increase in [Ca2+]i was dependent on the concentration of OAG added with two apparent potencies; half-maximal actions on [Ca2+]i were observed at 70 nM and greater than 20 microM. The increase in [Ca2+]i induced by OAG was blocked completely by chelating extracellular calcium, or by pretreatment with calcium channel blockers. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which itself induces a rise in [Ca2+]i in these cells that is similar in time course, magnitude, and drug sensitivity to that of OAG, blocked completely the actions of subsequent exposure to OAG. Analogous results were obtained using DiC8, although DiC8 induced a transient inhibition to 75% of basal levels of [Ca2+]i after the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, and DiC8 was less potent than OAG. These data indicated that diacylglycerols induce influx of extracellular calcium in these cells, possibly by activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, diacylglycerols and phorbol esters appear to utilize a common pathway in eliciting these actions on [Ca2+]i, possibly involving activation of a protein kinase C. These actions of diacylglycerol provide a pathway by which thyrotropin-releasing hormone may act to enhance calcium channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1678203602,"Bovine submaxillary mucin was purified and subjected to chemical deglycosylation by treatment at 20 degrees C with either anhydrous hydrogen fluoride or trifluoromethane sulfonic acid. Virtually all of the sialic acid, galactose, fucose, and over 90% of the N-acetylhexosamines were removed by these treatments. The amino acid compositions of the deglycosylated and native mucins were similar indicating that chemical deglycosylation did not cause significant degradation of the protein. Antiserum specific for the deglycosylated bovine submaxillary mucin was produced by immunization of rabbits with the deglycosylated mucin. RNA was isolated from bovine submaxillary glands by extraction with guanidine hydrochloride and further fractionated by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose to yield poly(A)+ mRNA. The poly(A)+ mRNA was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system using [35S]methionine, [3H]leucine, [3H]threonine, [3H]proline, or [3H]serine as radiolabel and the translation products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography before and after immunoprecipitation with the antiserum. A labeled product of molecular weight 60,000 was present in the immunoprecipitates obtained in the absence but not in the presence of the unlabeled competitor deglycosylated mucin. It is concluded that the primary translation product of the bovine submaxillary gland gene is a 60,000-dalton protein and that the monomer subunit of the mucin is about 170,000. Thus, in the native state the mucin consists of several self-associating subunits."

FABMS-determined molecular weights of individual components present in several different enzymatically derived classes of gonococcal monomers revealed that each of these classes was a complex mixture of up to 13 distinct peptidoglycan fragments. These ranged from the predominant disaccharide tetrapeptides possessing reducing or nonreducing 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid ends to relatively minor constituents containing glycine or asparagine in addition to traditional peptidoglycan amino acids, i.e. alanine, glutamic acid, and diaminopimelic acid. FABMS of high performance liquid chromatography-purified monomers yielded some sequence information; however, analysis even of unfractionated peptidoglycan mixtures using a JEOL HX110/HX110 tandem mass spectrometer operating at 10 kV provided unambiguous primary sequence data for the peptidoglycan monomers and defined the position of glycine in four compounds as well as the location of O-acetyl substituents (present on some compounds) on C-6 of the N-acetylmuramic acid residue."

https://openalex.org/W1535670154,"To determine the role of the adenylate cyclase system in potentiation of enzyme secretion, we used cholera toxin to activate adenylate cyclase before examining the effects of agents on chief cell cAMP and pepsinogen secretion. Dispersed chief cells were obtained from guinea pig stomach by fractionation of mucosal cells on a Percoll gradient. Incubation of cells with 100 nM cholera toxin for 90 min and subsequent incubation with carbachol or cholecystokinin resulted in augmentation of cellular cAMP and potentiation of pepsinogen secretion. The rate of increase in cAMP with carbachol or cholecystokinin was similar to that for the potentiated secretory response. To determine the role of changes in cell calcium on these effects, we examined the actions of the ionophore A23187. In cells preincubated with cholera toxin, A23187 augmented cAMP and caused potentiation of pepsinogen secretion. The effects of A23187, carbachol, and cholecystokinin on cells preincubated with cholera toxin were abolished by removing extracellular calcium or by adding the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine. These data indicate that in chief cells preincubated with cholera toxin, secretagogue-induced increases in cell calcium concentration activate calmodulin thereby augmenting levels of cAMP and causing potentiation of pepsinogen secretion. Modulation of adenylate cyclase by changes in chief cell calcium concentration appears to be one mechanism whereby secretagogue interaction can result in potentiation of pepsinogen secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2013992234,"To explore the potential use of retrovirus vectors for the transfer of genomic DNA sequences into mammalian cells, recombinant retroviral genomes were constructed that encode a functionally rearranged murine lambda 1 immunoglobulin gene. Several of these genomes could be transmitted intact to recipient cells by viral infection, although successful transmission depended both on the orientation of the lambda 1 sequences and on their specific placement within vector sequences. The lambda 1 gene transduced by viral infection was expressed in a cell lineage-specific manner, albeit at lower levels than endogenous lambda 1 gene expression in cells from the B-lymphocyte lineage. Vectors yielding integrated proviruses that lacked viral transcriptional enhancer sequences were used to show that neither viral transcription nor the viral transcriptional sequences themselves had any effect on the tissue specificity of lambda 1 gene expression or the absolute amount of lambda 1 transcription. Vector transcription did, however, dramatically decrease the amount of lambda 1 protein that could be detected in tranduced cells. These results suggest that retrovirus vectors may be useful reagents not only for the expression of complementary DNA sequences but also for studies of tissue-specific transcription in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1595826176,"Epithelial cells and some of their transformed derivatives require ethanolamine to grow normally in defined culture medium. When these cells are cultured without ethanolamine, the amount of cellular phosphatidylethanolamine is considerably reduced. Using a set of rat mammary carcinoma cell lines whose growth is responsive (64-24 cells) and not responsive (22-1 cells) to ethanolamine, the biochemical mechanism of ethanolamine responsiveness was investigated. The biosynthesis and metabolism of phospholipid, particularly of those involving phosphatidylethanolamine, were thus compared between the two types of cells. The incorporation of [3H]serine into phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in 64-24 cells was 60 and 37%, respectively, of those in 22-1 cells. However, the activity of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase was virtually the same in these cell lines. When these cells were cultured in the presence of [32P]phosphatidylcholine and [32P]phosphatidylethanolamine, the rate of accumulation of 32P-labeled phosphatidylserine from the radioactive phosphatidylethanolamine was considerably reduced in 64-24 cells compared to that in 22-1 cells, although the rate of synthesis of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from the radioactive phosphatidylcholine was similar between the two cell lines. The rate of labeling phosphatidylcholine from the radioactive phosphatidylethanolamine was also reduced in 64-24 cells, although the difference was not as great as that of phosphatidylserine. Incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylethanolamine was correlated with the concentration of ethanolamine in the culture medium in 64-24 cells, whereas in 22-1 cells the incorporation was not influenced by ethanolamine. Enzyme activities of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway were not significantly different between the two cell lines. The rate of degradation of phosphatidylethanolamine was also similar in these cell lines. These results show that ethanolamine responsiveness of 64-24 cells, and probably other epithelial cells, is due to a limited ability to synthesize phosphatidylserine resulting from a limited base-exchange activity utilizing phosphatidylethanolamine."

The inhibition was dependent on the preincubation time with the serine protease inhibitor and on the concentration of AGEPC and inhibitor. The IC50 value of diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester towards 5 X 10(-10) M AGEPC in serotonin release was 2.2 X 10(-4), 8.0 X 10(-4), and 5.0 X 10(-4) M, respectively. In experiments where platelets were incubated with these inhibitors and then washed with buffer, the inhibition of AGEPC stimulation was not observed. Prostaglandin H2 analog U46619 (10(-6) to 10(-5) M)- and thrombin (0.1 unit/ml)-induced platelet activation were also blocked by 1 mM diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 1 mM N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester. The binding of AGEPC (1.5 X 10(-11) to 9.4 X 10(-10) M) to platelets and the platelet cyclic AMP level were not affected by diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester. However, 1 mM diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 1 mM N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester suppressed 10(-9) M AGEPC-induced breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and formation of phosphatidic acid to 10-12 and 39-42%, 40-kDa protein phosphorylation to 4 and 30%, and arachidonic acid release to 17 and 28% of controls, respectively. On the other hand, 5 mM diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate did not inhibit diacylglycerol production and arachidonic acid release initiated by 2.5 mM deoxycholate treatment, suggesting that receptor-mediated phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 activation were inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor, but the deoxycholate (physicochemical stimulant)-initiated activation was not. AGEPC-induced 20-kDa protein phosphorylation and the inhibitory action of AGEPC on cyclic AMP accumulation were abolished in the presence of diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. However, a tryptic protease inhibitor, 1 mM p-aminobenzamidine and 1 mM benzoyl-l-arginine methyl ester, did not prevent the AGEPC-induced platelet secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1488197581,"Abstract The CO2 adducts resulting from N-, O-, and S-carboxylation of suitable precursors are close analogues of carboxylate substrates in which -NH-CO2-, -O-CO2-, or -S-CO2- replaces -CH2-CO2- in the physiological substrate, -NOH-CO-2 replaces -CHOH-CO-2 and O-CO2- replaces -O-PO3H- R-XH + CO2 in equilibrium with R-X-CO2- + H+ X(-XH = -NH2, -NHOH, -OH or -SH). We find that aconitase catalyzes the CO2-dependent dehydration of N-hydroxy-DL-aspartate and erythro-beta-hydroxyl-L-aspartate with respective kcat values 62 and 90% of kcat for citrate and Km values of 3.6 and 3.2 mM, respectively. The CO2 adducts (carbamates) of the precursors would be structural and stereo analogues of the physiological substrate isocitrate. Detailed kinetic analyses of the behavior of intermediates and products show that aconitase catalyzes the formation of the enzyme-bound CO2 adducts from enzyme-bound precursors and CO2 and directs them, as well as the preformed CO2 adducts, into alpha,beta water elimination reactions formally identical to the isocitrate/cis-aconitate reaction. Six other enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism (succinate thiokinase and isocitrate, glucose-6-phosphate, succinate semialdehyde, glutamate, and malate dehydrogenase) utilize CO2 adducts as reactive substrate analogues. At least one of these (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) catalyzes the formation of the enzyme-bound CO2 adduct (presumed to be D-glucose 6-carbonate in this case) from enzyme-bound precursor (D-glucose) and CO2 in the manner of aconitase. The case of malate dehydrogenase is unique because the reactive malate analogue, -O2C-O-CHOH-CO-2, arises from nucleophilic attack of HCO-3 on the carbonyl of glyoxylate, rather than electrophilic attack of CO2 on the hydrated carbonyl of glyoxylate."
https://openalex.org/W1496062134,"Our previous studies demonstrated that a site-specific cleavage event initiates the degradation of large premature termination polypeptides of beta-galactosidase in Escherichia coli. We have isolated the first cleavage intermediate, the polypeptide, by elution from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The NH2 terminus of this protein, determined by automated Edman degradation, was that of the wild-type molecule and thus established that the first cleavage event was at the COOH-terminal end. The sequence of the COOH-terminal end of the B polypeptide was determined by using the enzyme carboxypeptidase Y. Direct assignment of COOH-terminal residues was made by using o-phthaldialdehyde derivatization and the stoichiometry confirmed by a double-label analysis. The COOH-terminal end of the B polypeptide is at position 837 in the beta-galactosidase sequence. If a single endoproteolytic cleavage event was responsible, the cleavage would have occurred between 2 threonine residues (at positions 837 and 838) that are located within a hydrophobic domain. We have observed other covalent modifications that precede the appearance of the B polypeptide, but these do not appear to participate in signaling the first cleavage event. The structure of the COOH-terminal end of B suggests a high degree of specificity by the initial cleavage enzyme. We propose that this unique site serves as a specific signal and that exposure of this site to the specific cleavage enzyme controls the event initiating the degradation pathway."
