However, the two plastics will not mix together, which limits options for dealing with mixed waste and decreases the value of recycled products. Eagan et al. report the synthesis of multiblock copolymers of i PP and PE by using a selective polymer initiator (see the Perspective by Creton). The high-molecular-weig ht blocks could be used to reinforce the interface between i PP and PE and allow blending of the two polymers. Science , this issue p. 814 ; see also p. 797"

Leuenberger et al. explored thermostability on a proteome-wide scale in bacteria, yeast, and human cells by using a combination of limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry (see the Perspective by Vogel). Their results suggest that temperature-induced cell death is caused by the loss of a subset of proteins with key functions. The study also provides insight into the molecular and evolutionary bases of protein and proteome stability. Science , this issue p. eaai7825 ; see also p. 794"

Bacterially secreted peptides known as PSMs (phenol-soluble modulins) stimulate inflammatory responses, lyse human cells, and contribute to biofilm structuring. PSMα3 is a virulent 22-residue amyloid peptide secreted by Staphylococcus aureus. Tayeb-Fligelman et al. present a high-resolution structure encompassing the full length of the amyloid's sequence. This structure reveals an unexpected departure from the common amyloid cross-β folded architecture. Instead, PSMα3 forms amphipathic α-helices that are folded to stack perpendicular to the fibril axis into sheets. This unusual cross-α structure was important for fibril toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2590662729,"Neurotransmission is based on the exocytic fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) followed by endocytic membrane retrieval and the reformation of SVs. Recent data suggest that at physiological temperature SVs are internalized via clathrin-independent ultrafast endocytosis (UFE) within hundreds of milliseconds, while other studies have postulated a key role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of SV proteins on a timescale of seconds to tens of seconds. Here we demonstrate using cultured hippocampal neurons as a model that at physiological temperature SV endocytosis occurs on several timescales from less than a second to several seconds, yet, is largely independent of clathrin. Clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) of SV membranes is mediated by actin-nucleating formins such as mDia1, which are required for the formation of presynaptic endosome-like vacuoles from which SVs reform. Our results resolve previous discrepancies in the field and suggest that SV membranes are predominantly retrieved via CIE mediated by formin-dependent actin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2590442776,"Synaptojanin 1 (SJ1) is a major presynaptic phosphatase that couples synaptic vesicle endocytosis to the dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2, a reaction needed for the shedding of endocytic factors from their membranes. While the role of SJ1's 5-phosphatase module in this process is well recognized, the contribution of its Sac phosphatase domain, whose preferred substrate is PI4P, remains unclear. Recently a homozygous mutation in its Sac domain was identified in early-onset parkinsonism patients. We show that mice carrying this mutation developed neurological manifestations similar to those of human patients. Synapses of these mice displayed endocytic defects and a striking accumulation of clathrin-coated intermediates, strongly implicating Sac domain's activity in endocytic protein dynamics. Mutant brains had elevated auxilin (PARK19) and parkin (PARK2) levels. Moreover, dystrophic axonal terminal changes were selectively observed in dopaminergic axons in the dorsal striatum. These results strengthen evidence for a link between synaptic endocytic dysfunction and Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2589371597,"Coding of itch versus pain has been heatedly debated for decades. However, the current coding theories (labeled line, intensity, and selectivity theory) cannot accommodate all experimental observations. Here we identified a subset of spinal interneurons, labeled by gastrin-releasing peptide (Grp), that receive direct synaptic input from both pain and itch primary sensory neurons. When activated, these Grp+ neurons generated rarely seen, simultaneous robust pain and itch responses that were intensity dependent. Accordingly, we propose a ""leaky gate"" model in which Grp+ neurons transmit both itch and weak pain signals; however, upon strong painful stimuli, the recruitment of endogenous opioids works to close this gate, reducing overwhelming pain generated by parallel pathways. Consistent with our model, loss of these Grp+ neurons increased pain responses while itch was decreased. Our new model serves as an example of non-monotonic coding in the spinal cord and better explains observations in human psychophysical studies."

https://openalex.org/W2589192637,"Neuronal motor commands, whether generating real or neuroprosthetic movements, are shaped by ongoing sensory feedback from the displacement being produced. Here we asked if cortical stimulation could provide artificial feedback during operant conditioning of cortical neurons. Simultaneous two-photon imaging and real-time optogenetic stimulation were used to train mice to activate a single neuron in motor cortex (M1), while continuous feedback of its activity level was provided by proportionally stimulating somatosensory cortex. This artificial signal was necessary to rapidly learn to increase the conditioned activity, detect correct performance, and maintain the learned behavior. Population imaging in M1 revealed that learning-related activity changes are observed in the conditioned cell only, which highlights the functional potential of individual neurons in the neocortex. Our findings demonstrate the capacity of animals to use an artificially induced cortical channel in a behaviorally relevant way and reveal the remarkable speed and specificity at which this can occur."
https://openalex.org/W2590451633,"Thousands of long intergenic non-protein coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in mammals in genome-wide sequencing studies. Some of these RNAs have been consistently conserved during the evolution of species and could presumably function in important biologic processes. Therefore, we measured the levels of 26 highly conserved lincRNAs in a total of 176 pairs of endometrial carcinoma (EC) and surrounding non-tumor tissues of two distinct Chinese populations. Here, we report that a lincRNA, LINC00672, which possesses an ultra-conserved region, is aberrantly down-regulated during the development of EC. Nevertheless, LINC00672 is a p53-targeting lincRNA acting along with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins as a suppressive cofactor, which locally reinforces p53-mediated suppression of LASP1, an evolutionarily conserved neighboring gene of LINC00672 and putatively associated with increased tumor aggressiveness, during anti-tumor processes. LINC00672 overexpression could lower the levels of LASP1 and slow the development of malignant phenotypes of EC both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, LINC00672 significantly increased the 50% inhibitory concentration of paclitaxel in EC cells and increased the sensitivity of xenograft mice to paclitaxel. These findings indicate that LINC00672 can influence LASP1 expression as a locus-restricted cofactor for p53-mediated gene suppression, thus impacting EC malignancies and chemosensitivity to paclitaxel.

Among the various types of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) have been described as RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides. lincRNAs are also capped, polyadenylated, and often spliced.

Over the past several decades, thousands of lincRNAs have been identified in humans and mice, of which only a few have orthologs outside of these two species (4Khalil A.M. Guttman M. Huarte M.

Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). However, Ulitsky et al. (14Ulitsky I. Shkumatava A. Jan C.H. Sive H. Bartel D.P. Conserved function of lincRNAs in vertebrate embryonic development despite rapid sequence evolution.Cell. 2011; 147: 1537-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) have identified over 550 distinct lincRNAs in zebrafish, among which 26 lincRNAs exhibit both a detectable sequence similar to putative human orthologs and conserved genomic sites throughout vertebrate evolution. High sequence conservation suggests that these lincRNAs may possess conserved structural features, which have conferred crucial functions upon them throughout evolution. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that lincRNAs could regulate the expression of neighboring protein-coding genes by functioning as enhancers or epigenetic regulatory elements (7Ørom U.A. Derrien T. Beringer M. Gumireddy K. Gardini A. Bussotti G. Lai F. Zytnicki M. Notredame C. Huang Q. Guigo R. Shiekhattar R.

A long noncoding RNA maintains active chromatin to coordinate homeotic gene expression.Nature. 2011; 472: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). The relative location of the conserved sequences has led us to believe that these lincRNAs may function predominantly in association with their conserved neighboring protein-coding genes. Although the importance of lincRNAs in normal physiologic processes and disease is increasingly recognized, our knowledge of cancer-related lincRNA, however, remains limited. Therefore, it is particularly important to elucidate the function of these highly conserved lincRNAs and their working mechanism in EC. Here, we report the identification of LINC00672 with highly conserved sequence and genome location, which is significantly down-regulated during the progression of the FIGO stages of EC. In addition, LINC00672 also influences the chemotherapeutic effects of paclitaxel. Biochemical assays have demonstrated that LINC00672 acts as a p53-mediated suppressive cofactor that locally reinforces LASP1 repression during anti-tumor processes. Moreover, LINC00672 expression may impact the IC50 value of paclitaxel and the chemosensitivity of EC cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential clinical value for chemotherapy of EC patients. After the categorization and selection described under “Experimental procedures,” we first performed qRT-PCR analysis to identify the expression patterns of the selected 13 candidate lincRNAs in 104 pairs of EC tissue samples from an Eastern Chinese population (Suzhou center). The results showed that the expression levels of LINC00672 were significantly higher (∼4.15-fold, p < 0.001) in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues than in tumor tissues. No other lincRNAs showed significant difference in expression level between EC and adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 1A). The results were also confirmed in 72 other pairs of EC and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues of a population in southern China (Guangzhou center). The LINC00672 levels were notably higher (∼3.5-fold, p < 0.001) in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues than in tumor tissues (Fig. 1A). A pooled analysis of both the discovery and validation datasets demonstrated that the LINC00672 expression was at a lower level among 68.8% (121/176) of all the EC patients (Fig. 1B). As discovered by Ulitsky et al. (14Ulitsky I. Shkumatava A. Jan C.H. Sive H. Bartel D.P. Conserved function of lincRNAs in vertebrate embryonic development despite rapid sequence evolution.Cell. 2011; 147: 1537-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), the sequence of LINC00672 is detectable and similar to the putative mammalian orthologs that are restricted to a single short region of high conservation, and its genomic location is also conserved (it conservatively neighbors the LASP1 gene in the same orientation throughout species evolution). We then detected LINC00672 in the total RNA of two pairs of human EC tissue samples using Northern blotting (Fig. 1C). To determine the cellular localization of LINC00672, we fractionated EC cell lines into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and thoroughly separated the chromatin of the cells from the nuclear fraction. The data revealed that LINC00672 was strongly enriched in the chromatin fraction of both HEC-1A and Ishikawa cells (Fig. 1D). To further verify the coding potential of LINC00672, we re-analyzed a dataset of human lymphoblastoid cell ribosome sequencing profiling and measured the ribosome occupancy level at the LASP1 gene locus (16Battle A. Khan Z. Wang S.H. Mitrano A. Ford M.J. Pritchard J.K. Gilad Y. Genomic variation. Impact of regulatory variation from RNA to protein.Science. 2015; 347: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 17Guttman M. Russell P. Ingolia N.T. Weissman J.S. Lander E.S. Ribosome profiling provides evidence that large noncoding RNAs do not encode proteins.Cell. 2013; 154: 240-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). As expected, the ribosome profiling reads are highly concentrated within the coding region of the LASP1 gene but not LINC00672 (Fig. 2A). A previous genome-wide analysis of the human p53 transcriptional network (18Sánchez Y. Segura V. Marín-Béjar O. Athie A. Marchese F.P. González J. Bujanda L. Guo S. Matheu A. Huarte M. Genome-wide analysis of the human p53 transcriptional network unveils a lncRNA tumour suppressor signature.Nature communications. 2014; 5: 5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) indicated that LINC00672 might be a p53 transcriptional target. To confirm this possibility, we examined the enrichment of evolutionarily conserved p53-binding motifs in the promoter of LINC00672 and found that the promoter region of LINC00672 contained highly conserved canonical p53-binding motifs. Next, we cloned the proximal promoter region of LINC00672 to construct reporter plasmids (pGL3-LINC00672) and performed luciferase assays in normal EC cells and cells with p53 pharmacologically inhibited (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). As illustrated in Fig. 2B, luciferase activity significantly decreased in the p53-inhibited cells, compared with the control cells. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to determine whether p53 directly binds to the sites containing the consensus motifs in vivo. The results showed significant increases in p53, RNAP II, and P300 enrichment at the site within the promoter of LINC00672. No enrichment was shown at the negative control sites that contain irrelevant regions (Fig. 2C). Finally, we examined LINC00672 expression in the tissues from p53−/− and WT mice. The results also revealed that the absence of p53 influences the expression of LINC00672 in uterus (Fig. 2D). The PhyloP algorithm from UCSC discovered a region of 125 nt from human LINC00672 with deep evolutionary conservation across 100 vertebrates (Fig. 2E), prompting a crucial role of this region. We then used 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to determine the transcriptional initiation and termination sites of LINC00672 (supplemental Fig. 1, A–C). We analyzed the RNA folding potential of the full-length LINC00672 and the 125-nt truncated version of LINC00672 based on the conserved sequence and the compensatory changes in base-wise conservation. The predicted folding structure of LINC00672 greatly changed with the deep conserved 125-nt region removed (supplemental Fig. 1D). We further investigated the effects of LINC00672 on the cell cycle by analyzing PI-stained EC cells with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The representative results of the cell cycle distribution in the empty vector, LINC00672, and LINC00672-mutant lentiviruses transfected EC cells (supplemental Fig. 2C), and the locked nucleic acid (LNA) Gapmers (LNA-based antisense oligonucleotides strategy) targeting LINC00672-treated EC cells are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that LINC00672 overexpression resulted in a significant accumulation of HEC-1A and Ishikawa cells in G2-M phase, whereas there were no significant changes in the number of cells transfected with the truncated version of LINC00672 (removed the 125-nt conserved region) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the treatment of LNAs targeting LINC00672 resulted in a significant decrease in cell number in the G2-M phase (Fig. 3B). Also, we investigated the effects of LINC00672 on EC cell apoptosis, and no significant changes of cell apoptosis were detected (supplemental Fig. 2, D and E). We next examined the effects of LINC00672 on cell proliferation and found that the overexpression of LINC00672 in endometrial cancer cells HEC-1A and Ishikawa substantially reduced cell proliferation. Transfection with the mutant version of LINC00672 makes no significant changes in the control cells (Fig. 3C), but knockdown of LINC00672 by LNA Gapmers significantly increased EC cell proliferation (Fig. 3D). We also performed a colony formation assay using HEC-1A and Ishikawa cells and found that the overexpression of LINC00672 markedly decreased the colony formation ability of endometrial cancer cells. The LNA-mediated knockdown of LINC00672 conspicuously increased EC cells colony formation ability, whereas the impact of truncated LINC00672 transfection on EC cell viability is not significant (Fig. 3, E and F). To investigate the influence of LINC00672 expression on the migration ability of EC cells, we conducted transwell and wound-healing assays, using EC cells with LINC00672 overexpressed and knocked down. As illustrated in Fig. 4, A–D, both the transwell and wound-healing assays demonstrated that the migration capability of HEC-1A and Ishikawa cells was significantly suppressed by LINC00672 overexpression and both assays were stimulated by LINC00672 knockdown. But the mutant version of LINC00672 had no significant impact on the migration and invasion of EC cells. To probe the effects of LINC00672 on cancer cell dynamics in vivo, we injected LINC00672-knockdown cells, LINC00672 up-regulated cells, LINC00672-mutant cells and control cells into the hind flanks of nude mice. We observed that the growth of LINC00672 up-regulated xenografts was significantly inhibited, compared with that of control xenografts. But xenografts of the mutant version of LINC00672 showed no significant difference in the control cells (Fig. 4E). The growth of LINC00672-knockdown xenografts was substantially promoted, compared with that of control xenografts (Fig. 4F and supplemental Fig. 2, F and G). To determine whether the expression pattern of LINC00672 correlated with the expression of LASP1, we detected a negative correlation between the expression levels of LINC00672 and LASP1 in 62 pairs of randomly selected EC tissues (Fig. 5A). To further evaluate the effects of LINC00672 on LASP1 gene expression, we analyzed the expression of LASP1 gene. We found that the expression diminished when LINC00672 was overexpressed. However, it was up-regulated when LINC00672 was knocked down in the EC cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Moreover, there were no significant changes in LASP1 expression in the EC cells transfected with LINC00672-mutant lentivirus. The protein level of LASP1 detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay revealed the same trends in the LINC00672-manipulated EC cells (Fig. 5, D–F). We also measured the expression patterns of three other putative p53 target genes (p21, bax, and gadd45) in LINC00672-manipulated EC cells. The results showed no significant impact of LINC00672 on these genes (supplemental Fig. 2H).

Interestingly, the binding predictions showed that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F and H (hnRNP F and hnRNP H) bind precisely to the ∼125-nt highly evolutionarily conserved sequence in the 5′-portion of LINC00672, and this interaction was specifically identified as NPInter (ncRNA-protein interactions) according to the catRAPID discriminative analysis. To verify this prediction, we performed an RNA-pulldown experiment followed by Western blotting against hnRNP F and hnRNP H. A strong signal for hnRNP F was detected in proteins that were pulled down with the sense strand of LINC00672, as well as hnRNP H, but not hnRNP D and hnRNP I (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, we detected a significant low enrichment of hnRNP F/H, using the mutant version of LINC00672 in the pulldown assays followed by Western blotting, when the ∼125-nt ultraconserved sequence was depleted (Fig. 5G). The results indicated that the 125-nt ultraconserved region of LINC00672 may be a major hnRNP F/H-binding domain and that it is required for this association. To further confirm this interaction, we examined this interaction between LINC00672 and hnRNP F/H by using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). The results showed a significant enrichment of LINC00672 bound to the hnRNP F and H antibody, compared with the nonspecific IgG control antibody (Fig. 5, H and I). It is notable that we did not detect a direct interaction between LINC00672 and p53 (Fig. 5, H and I). Taken together, these results demonstrated a specific association between hnRNP F/H and LINC00672. We next addressed the mechanism by which LINC00672 suppresses LASP1 expression. As p53 has been documented to directly suppress LASP1 (21Wang B. Feng P. Xiao Z. Ren E.C. LIM and SH3 protein 1 (Lasp1) is a novel p53 transcriptional target involved in hepatocellular carcinoma.J.

The pGL3-LASP1 luciferase activities were increased by ∼1.8-fold in the p53-inhibited EC cells (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). As for the plasmid of pGL3-LASP1Δp53RE, no significant differences were detected in p53-inhibited EC cell lines (Fig. 6, A and B). However, several transcriptional co-activators, such as hnRNP K, have been implicated in the regulation of p53 target gene expression; this regulation occurs via the recruitment of p53 and/or via the stabilization of p53 binding (23Jung Y.S.

Consistent with previous data, we detected hnRNPs (including hnRNP F, H, K, D, and I) and p53 at the sites near the LASP1 promoter, including p53REs (Fig. 6C), LINC00672 overexpression, LINC00672 mutant, and LINC00672 knockdown, respectively, and the control cells via ChIP experiments (Fig. 6, D and E). Interestingly, we observed significant enrichments of hnRNP K, hnRNP F, hnRNP H, and p53 at the p53RE regions of the LASP1 promoter in the cells that were transfected with LINC00672 but not in the cells with LINC00672 knockdown. The ChIP data also revealed that the binding of hnRNP K, F, H, and p53 at the LASP1 p53REs was reduced to the control levels in the LINC00672-mutant cells (Fig. 6, D and E), indicating that LINC00672 may be required for the recruitment of hnRNP F, H, K, and p53 to the p53REs of the LASP1 promoter. Moreover, the strength of p53 binding at the LASP1 promoter was significantly diminished in the LINC00672-knockdown cells and elevated in the LINC00672-overexpression cells, but no significant changes were shown in the LINC00672-mutant cells (Fig. 6D). Consistent with the model wherein LINC00672, hnRNP F, H, and K cooperate to assist p53-dependent repression of LASP1 transcription, the knockdown of hnRNP F, H, and K lowered p53 enrichment at the p53RE regions of LASP1 in EC cells (Fig. 6F and supplemental Fig. 2, I and J). Furthermore, the previous reported that hnRNP F could directly interacted with hnRNP K (30Wei C.C. Zhang S.L. Chen Y.W. Guo D.F. Ingelfinger J.R. Bomsztyk K. Chan J.S.

We hypothesized that this seeming paradox could be explained by proteins that bind to and control the local activity or substrate targeting of OGA, thereby resulting in the observed stress-induced elevations of O-GlcNAc. To identify potential protein partners, we utilized BioID proximity biotinylation in combination with stable isotopic labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC).

The associations of OGA with fatty acid synthase (FAS), filamin-A, heat shock cognate 70-kDa protein, and OGT were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. The pool of OGA bound to FAS demonstrated a substantial (∼85%) reduction in specific activity, suggesting that FAS inhibits OGA. Consistent with this observation, FAS overexpression augmented stress-induced O-GlcNAcylation.

The ADAM ( a d isintegrin a nd m etalloproteinase) proteases are involved in ectodomain cleavage of transmembrane proteins, and ADAM17 is known to cleave Nectin-4 in breast cancer. However, the mechanism of Nectin-4 cleavage in ovarian cancer has not yet been determined. Analysis of ovarian cancer gene microarray data showed that higher expression of Nectin-4, ADAM10, and ADAM17 is associated with significantly decreased progression-free survival. We quantified Nectin-4 shedding from the surface of ovarian cancer cells after stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid. We report that ADAM17 and ADAM10 cleave Nectin-4 and release soluble Nectin-4 (sN4). Small molecule inhibitors and siRNA knockdown of both ADAM proteases confirmed these results. In matched samples from 11 high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients, we detected 2–20-fold more sN4 in ascites fluid than serum. Co-incubation of ovarian cancer cells with ascites fluid significantly increased sN4 shedding, which could be blocked using a dual inhibitor of ADAM10 and ADAM17. Furthermore, we detected RNA for Nectin-4, ADAM10, and ADAM17 in primary ovarian carcinoma tumors, secondary omental metastases, and ascites cells isolated from serous ovarian cancer patients. In a signaling pathway screen, lysophosphatidic acid increased phosphorylation of AKT, EGF receptor, ERK1/2, JNK1/2/3, and c-Jun. Understanding the function of Nectin-4 shedding in ovarian cancer progression is critical to facilitate its development as both a serum biomarker and a therapeutic target for ovarian cancer."

Under normoxia, HIFα subunits are hydroxylated at the proline residue and subjected to ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation.

Overall, HIFs play distinct and overlapping functions in various tissue and cell types. In the adult skeletal muscle, exercise induces HIF1α expression, and myofiber-specific disruption of HIF1α results in a decrease in exercise endurance, suppression of oxidative metabolism, and attenuation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)-mediated glucose uptake (23Sakagami H.

Interestingly, HIF1α and HIF2α play distinct roles in fast and slow myofibers. HIF1α plays a role in fast myofiber formation (26Lunde I.G. Anton S.L. Bruusgaard J.C. Rana Z.A. Ellefsen S.

In contrast, HIF2α acts as a positive regulator of slow fiber type through acting downstream of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) (25Rasbach K.A. Gupta R.K. Ruas J.L. Wu J. Naseri E. Estall J.L. Spiegelman B.M. PGC-1α regulates a HIF2α-dependent switch in skeletal muscle fiber types.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21866-21871Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). HIF3α mRNA level is elevated in skeletal muscle after acute exposure to hypoxia or after intermittent hypoxia training, and HIF3α RNAi-treated rats had improved exercise endurance (28Li Q.F. Dai A.G. Differential expression of three hypoxia-inducible factor-α subunits in pulmonary arteries of rat with hypoxia-induced hypertension.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2005; 37: 665-672Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These data suggest that HIFs play key roles in maintaining metabolic and contractile functions of myofibers in adult muscles. Emerging studies also point to a role of HIF1α in muscle progenitors (myoblasts) in vitro. HIF1α protein is stabilized in cultured myoblasts under hypoxia (20Kubis H.P. Hanke N. Scheibe R.J. Gros G.

These results underscore the context-dependent function of HIF1α and further suggest that HIF1α may also function as signaling regulators in addition to their canonical role as a transcription factor (23Sakagami H.

Recently, it was reported that HIF1α inhibited ischemia-induced muscle regeneration through inhibiting Wnt signaling (30Majmundar A.J. Lee D.S. Skuli N. Mesquita R.C. Kim M.N. Yodh A.G. Nguyen-McCarty M. Li B. Simon M.C. HIF modulation of Wnt signaling regulates skeletal myogenesis in vivo.Development. 2015; 142: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Together, despite the wealthy knowledge of HIF1α and HIF2α in post-differentiation myofibers, the function of HIF1α and HIF2α in muscle stem cells in vivo is poorly understood. In this study we used MyoDCre knockin mice to drive co-deletion of HIF1α and HIF2α, in order to determine the function of HIF1α/HIF2α in embryonic myoblasts. We further used tamoxifen-inducible Pax7CreER mice to drive HIF1α/HIF2α deletion in postnatal satellite cells. We provided the first evidence that HIF1α and HIF2α are dispensable for normal development of skeletal muscles but necessary for proper regeneration of adult muscles after acute injury. Therefore, HIFs play context-dependent roles in embryonic myoblasts and postnatal satellite cells. Previous studies have shown that HIF1α are indispensable for embryonic development, and global loss of HIF1α leads to lethality (16Simon M.C. Keith B.

HIF2α-deficient mice develop severe vascular defects and show developmental arrest between E9.5 and E12.5 depending on the genetic background (33Forristal C.E. Wright K.L. Hanley N.A. Oreffo R.O.

Loss of HIF-2α and inhibition of VEGF impair fetal lung maturation, whereas treatment with VEGF prevents fatal respiratory distress in premature mice.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 702-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the specific function of HIFs in muscle development remains unclear. As Pax3Cre-mediated deletion of HIF1α results in apparently normal skeletal muscles (30Majmundar A.J. Lee D.S. Skuli N. Mesquita R.C. Kim M.N. Yodh A.G. Nguyen-McCarty M. Li B. Simon M.C. HIF modulation of Wnt signaling regulates skeletal myogenesis in vivo.Development. 2015; 142: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we sought to examine whether HIF1α and HIF2α play redundant roles in muscle development. To achieve this we developed the HIF1α and HIF2α double knock-out mouse model using the muscle-specific MyoDCre as a driver (MyoD-HIFdKO). Because MyoD is specifically and ubiquitously activated in early embryonic myoblasts, this model should result in deletion of HIF1α and HIF2α in all muscle progenitors and mature myofibers (7Collins C.A. Olsen I. Zammit P.S. Heslop L. Petrie A. Partridge T.A. Morgan J.E. Stem cell function, self-renewal, and behavioral heterogeneity of cells from the adult muscle satellite cell niche.Cell. 2005; 122: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 10Zammit P.S. Golding J.P. Nagata Y. Hudon V. Partridge T.A. Beauchamp J.R. Muscle satellite cells adopt divergent fates: a mechanism for self-renewal?.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the MyoD-HIFdKO mice were born at a normal Mendelian ratio and did not exhibit any morphological abnormality. Specifically, the initial body weight and postnatal growth of MyoD-HIFdKO mice were completely normal (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the weight and size of various muscles were identical between control and MyoD-HIFdKO mice (Fig. 1B). Muscle morphology was also indistinguishable between the two groups (Fig. 1C). Finally, we measured myofiber number and size of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles and did not find any differences between control and MyoD-HIFdKO mice (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that HIF1α and HIF2α are dispensable for skeletal muscle development and postnatal growth under normal oxygen conditions. The normal development and growth of skeletal muscles in the MyoD-HIFdKO mice suggest that coordinated angiogenesis and myogenesis may have ensured adequate oxygen supply and rendered HIF1α and HIF2α dispensable for embryonic myogenesis. By contrast, ischemic low oxygen levels (hypoxia) typically occur after muscle injury and during muscle regeneration (36Merrick M.A. Secondary injury after musculoskeletal trauma: a review and update.J. Athl Train. 2002; 37: 209-217PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, examination of HIF1α and HIF2α expression indicates that HIF1α protein and mRNA levels rise after cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced muscle injury, peaking at 2–3 days post injury (DPI) when active myoblast proliferation occurs (Fig. 2, A and B). However, HIF2α levels decrease dramatically upon injury-induced myofiber degeneration and gradually return to the normal level at the completion of muscle regeneration (Fig. 2C). The in vivo dynamics of HIF1α and HIF2α during muscle regeneration suggest that HIF1α is mainly expressed in myoblasts, but HIF2α is mainly expressed in myofibers. Consistent with this notion, the mRNA level of HIF1α is much higher than that of HIF2α in proliferating myoblasts (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the mRNA level of HIF2α is much higher than that of HIF1α in post-differentiation myotubes (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that regenerative muscles are challenged by hypoxia, and HIF1α and HIF2α may play stage-specific functions in myoblasts and myofibers, respectively. To identify the role of HIF1α and HIF2α in satellite cell-mediated muscle regeneration, we used satellite cell-specific Pax7CreER to drive double knock-out of HIF1α and HIF2α (Pax7CreER-HIFdKO) (8Halevy O.

In this model, HIF1α and HIF2α should be specifically knocked out in satellite cells after tamoxifen induction (i.p. injection). This model also circumvents the cofounding effects of HIF1α/HIF2α KO in myofibers in the MyoD-HIFdKO mice. The control group includes HIF1αf/f HIF2αf/f mice similarly injected with tamoxifen. To confirm the efficiency of tamoxifen-induced knock-out, we measured the HIF1α and HIF2α mRNA levels in satellite cells isolated from tamoxifen-induced mice (supplemental Fig. S1). This analysis showed that HIF1α and HIF2α were efficiently knocked out in myoblasts. After tamoxifen-induced deletion of HIF1α and HIF2α in satellite cells, CTX was injected into tibialis anterior (TA) muscle to induce ischemic muscle injury in both control and Pax7CreER-HIFdKO mice. Samples were collected 7 and 21 days post CTX injection (Fig. 3A; see Fig. 5A). Compared with those of control mice, the CTX-injected TA muscles of Pax7CreER-HIFdKO mice exhibited decreased sizes and significantly lower weights at 7 DPI (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, TA muscles of Pax7CreER-HIFdKO mice were poorly regenerated, manifested by fewer newly regenerated, central nucleated myofibers (Fig. 3D). We also measured the regenerated and non-regenerated areas from cross sections of control mice and Pax7CreER-HIFdKO mice. Pax7CreER-HIFdKO mice exhibited a smaller regenerative area as well as a larger non-regenerative region than the littermate control mice (Fig. 3E). However, no morphological differences were observed in regenerated muscles between the control and Pax7CreER-HIF dKO groups at 21 DPI (see Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, satellite cell-specific HIF1α and HIF2α deficiency delayed muscle regeneration after acute injuries.Figure 5Reduced satellite cell number in skeletal muscles of Pax7Cre-HIFdKO mice 21 days after CTX-induced muscle injury. A, experimental design. Tamoxifen was i.p.-injected daily into Pax7CreERHIF1αf/fHIF2αf/f and HIF1αf/fHIF2αf/f mice for 5 days to activate CreER and induce deletion of HIF1α and HIF2α.

This network, which involves residues Asp-222, His-143, Thr-139, His-189, and structural waters, is located at the edge of PLP opposite the reactive Schiff base. We demonstrate that this hydrogen bond network directly influences the protonation state of the pyridine nitrogen of PLP, which affects the rates of catalysis. We analyzed perturbations caused by single- and double-mutant variants using steady-state kinetics, high resolution X-ray crystallography, and quantum chemical calculations. Protonation of the pyridinyl nitrogen to form a pyridinium cation induces electronic delocalization in the PLP, which correlates with the enhancement in catalytic rate in AAT. Thus, PLP activation is controlled by the proximity of the pyridinyl nitrogen to the hydrogen bond microenvironment.

https://openalex.org/W2590223143,"The developmental mechanisms regulating the number of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) are largely unknown. Here we show that the cleavage plane orientation in murine embryonic radial glia cells (RGCs) regulates the number of aNSCs in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). Randomizing spindle orientation in RGCs by overexpression of Insc or a dominant-negative form of Lgn (dnLgn) reduces the frequency of self-renewing asymmetric divisions while favoring symmetric divisions generating two SNPs. Importantly, these changes during embryonic development result in reduced seeding of aNSCs. Interestingly, no effects on aNSC numbers were observed when Insc was overexpressed in postnatal RGCs or aNSCs. These data suggest a new mechanism for controlling aNSC numbers and show that the role of spindle orientation during brain development is highly time and region dependent."

Moreover, aS forms a covalent adduct with DHA. Here, we provide evidence that His-50 is the main site of this covalent modification.

We show, by mass spectrometry and spectroscopic techniques, that H50Q and aS4ox are modified by DHA, whereas acetyl-aS is not. We correlated this modification with aS structural features, and we suggest a possible functional role of aS in sequestering the early peroxidation products of fatty acids, thereby reducing the level of highly reactive lipid species. Finally, we show that fibrillar aS loses almost 80% of its scavenging activity, thus lacking a potentially protective function.

Each oxidation mechanism yields specific products, in particular hydroperoxides, hydroxide positional isomers, and free radicals that are highly reactive (19Frankel E.N. Chemistry of free radical and singlet oxidation of lipids.Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 197-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The relative susceptibility of PUFAs to oxidation depends on the reaction milieu as well as their inherent structure. The biological role of PUFA peroxidation products has received a great deal of attention because when it was discovered that α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, the advanced lipid peroxidation end products, can react with sulfhydryl groups of proteins, forming stable adducts able to affect several metabolic processes (20Reed T.T. Lipid peroxidationand neurodegenerative disease.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 51: 1302-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation is involved in several human diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, acute lung injury, as well as neurodegenerative disorders including PD (21Tsang A.H. Chung K.K. Oxidative and nitrosative stress in Parkinson's disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), Huntington disease (22Pérez-De La Cruz V. Elinos-Calderón D. Robledo-Arratia Y. Medina-Campos O.N. Pedraza-Chaverrí J. Ali S.F. Santamaría A. Targeting oxidative/nitrergic stress ameliorates motor impairment, and attenuates synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid peroxidation in two models of Huntington's disease.Behav. Brain Res. 2009; 199: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Alzheimer disease (23Galasko D. Montine T.J. Biomarkers of oxidative damage and inflammation in Alzheimer's disease.Biomark. Med. 2010; 4: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore, efforts have been devoted to understanding the mechanism of lipid peroxidation and preventing the deleterious effects of this process. Interestingly, it was shown that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), a product of lipid peroxidation, forms protein adducts in Lewy bodies in neocortical and brain neurons (24Dalfó E. Portero-Otín M. Ayala V. Martínez A. Pamplona R. Ferrer I. Evidence of oxidative stress in the neocortex in incidental Lewy body disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 816-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). 4HNE was also found to alter dopamine transport, contributing to the loss of dopamine, which is a feature of PD (25Morel P. Tallineau C. Pontcharraud R. Piriou A. Huguet F. Effects of 4-hydroxynonenal, a lipid peroxidation product, on dopamine transport and Na+/K+ ATPase in rat striatal synaptosomes.Neurochem. Int. 1998; 33: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the correlation between aS and PUFAs has raised considerable interest. The consequences of aS ability to interact with PUFAs are immediately ascertainable on its structure, because the protein undergoes conformational transition in the presence of fatty acids containing unsaturations (26Broersen K. van den Brink D. Fraser G. Goedert M. Davletov B. α-Synuclein adopts an α-helical conformation in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hinder micelle formation.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15610-15616Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27De Franceschi G. Frare E. Bubacco L. Mammi S. Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. Molecular insights into the interaction between α-synuclein and docosahexaenoic acid.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 94-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It seems that the 1–70 region of aS is mainly involved in the molecular interaction with the fatty acid (27De Franceschi G. Frare E. Bubacco L. Mammi S. Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. Molecular insights into the interaction between α-synuclein and docosahexaenoic acid.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 94-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We, in particular, showed that aS in the presence of DHA acquires α-helical secondary structure and forms, upon incubation, toxic oligomers able to affect membrane permeability (27De Franceschi G. Frare E. Bubacco L. Mammi S. Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. Molecular insights into the interaction between α-synuclein and docosahexaenoic acid.J. Mol.

Polverino de Laureto P. α-Synuclein oligomers induced by docosahexaenoic acid affect membrane integrity.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e82732Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mutual effect between DHA and aS is strongly determined by the protein/lipid ratio. Furthermore, the protein undergoes chemical modifications, such as the formation of a covalent adduct with DHA, methionine (Met) residue oxidation, and carbonylation (29De Franceschi G. Frare E. Pivato M. Relini A. Penco A. Greggio E. Bubacco L. Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. Structural and morphological characterization of aggregated species of α-synuclein induced by docosahexaenoic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22262-22274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The four Met residues (Met-1, Met-5, Met-116, and Met-127) are easily oxidized to sulfoxide and this phenomenon plays an important role in modulating aS membrane binding and aggregation (30Glaser C.B. Yamin G. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Methionine oxidation, α-synuclein and Parkinson’s disease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Methionine sulfoxide reductase reverses oxidized aS suggesting that the protein can contribute to the protection of membrane from oxidative damage (31Maltsev A.S. Chen J. Levine R.L. Bax A. Site-specific interaction between α-synuclein and membranes probed by NMR-observed methionine oxidation rates.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135: 2943-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was observed that 4HNE formed under strong oxidative stress conditions can covalently bind aS, triggering the formation of β-sheet-rich oligomers (32Bae E.J. Ho D.H. Park E. Jung J.W. Cho K. Hong J.H. Lee H.J. Kim K.P. Lee S.J. Lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal promotes seeding-capable oligomer formation and cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18: 770-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between aS structure, its binding to PUFAs, and the role of the chemical modification, is still not clear. It was proposed that aS may act physiologically as a catalytically regenerated scavenger of oxidants in healthy cells (33Schildknecht S. Gerding H.R. Karreman C. Drescher M. Lashuel H.A. Outeiro T.F. Di Monte D.A. Leist M. Oxidative and nitrative α-synuclein modifications and proteostatic stress: implications for disease mechanisms and interventions in synucleinopathies.J. Neurochem. 2013; 125: 491-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show by mass spectrometry analysis that the early radical products of DHA and AA autoxidation react with aS, producing a covalent modification on the protein. Histidine (His) at position 50 seems to be the major target of this reaction and the four Met are oxidized. To understand if the role of His would be specific in this sort of scavenger activity of free radicals, we analyze DHA in the presence of a pathogenic aS variant presenting the H50Q missense mutation (34Proukakis C. Dudzik C.G. Brier T. MacKay D.S. Cooper J.M. Millhauser G.L. Houlden H. Schapira A.H.

Disord. 2013; 28: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Then we evaluated a possible contribution of Met residues by using a completely oxidized aS and to understand the role of the 7 imperfect 11-residue repeats domain, all lysine (Lys) residues were acetylated. Finally, for a correlation with the aggregation state of aS, DHA was also analyzed in the presence of aS fibrils. Our in vitro data suggest that aS might be able to exert a sequestering/scavenging activity versus DHA and AA early radical autoxidation products that is modulated by different factors. First, the mutual structural interaction between aS and PUFAs is an essential prerequisite for this activity, because it provides a stabilizing effect on the fatty acid physical state. Second, His and Lys collaborate in sequestering the early peroxidation products. In this way, the propagation of the oxidative process of fatty acids is hampered, and concentration of the highly reactive species is reduced. DHA and AA samples were incubated at pH 7 and 37 °C under shaking up to 24 h, in the absence and presence of aS (P/lipid molar ratio 1:50). Aliquots from DHA samples were analyzed by direct injection in electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS (Fig. 2). The ESI-MS spectrum of DHA just after its solubilization is reported in Fig. 2A. It presents a specific pattern of several signals (37Murphy R.C. Axelsen P.H. Mass spectrometric analysis of long-chain lipids.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2011; 30: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar): the most peculiar are those at mass/charge values of 329.2, 351.2, and 367.2 corresponding to a protonated molecular DHA (monoisotopic mass 328.2 Da), an adduct with sodium (328.2 Da + 22), and an oxidized form of this adduct (328.2 Da + 22 + 16). Moreover, other minor signals due to in-cone fragmentation (m/z 311.2, 269.2) are also visible. After 24 h of incubation (Fig. 2B), the signals at m/z 329.2, 351.2, and 367.2, characteristics of DHA, disappear and new species are evident in the spectrum at m/z values of 381.3, 397.2, and 415.2 corresponding to hydroperoxide derivatives of DHA, which generate during the propagation phase of the fatty acids autoxidation (Scheme 1). The species at m/z 415.2 is the most intense signal and it has been identified by MS-MS analysis, as a di-hydroperoxide derivative of DHA (Table 1). Then the fatty acid was incubated in the presence of aS recording the mass spectra up to 24 h (Fig. 2D). The 24-h spectrum is quite similar to that obtained at time 0 (Fig. 2, A and C) and the oxidized species do not form in the presence of the protein. As control, DHA upon 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of aS added immediately before the MS analysis, was analyzed to show that the higher molecular weight DHA species are still detectable.Scheme 1Mechanism of non-enzymatic free-radical mediated oxidation of unsaturated lipids. These chain reactions, described in terms of initiation (1), propagation (2), and termination (3), are also defined lipid autoxidation process (19Frankel E.N. Chemistry of free radical and singlet oxidation of lipids.Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 197-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).

In Fig. 2E, the m/z spectrum of AA is reported, where the signals corresponding to molecular AA, its sodium adduct, and its hydroxyl form are evident (m/z 305.3, 327.3, and 343.3). Also the products of partial degradation of AA (37Murphy R.C. Axelsen P.H. Mass spectrometric analysis of long-chain lipids.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2011; 30: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) at m/z 259.2, 269.2, and 287.2 are visible. After 24 h of incubation, AA forms several species including the di-hydroperoxy derivative (m/z 391.3), a sign of autoxidation process (Fig. 2F). In Fig. 2, G and H, the same spectra are recorded in the presence of aS, showing that in this case the early autoxidation products do not form within 24 h of incubation with the protein. In Table 1, the species of DHA and AA identified by MS analysis are listed. The mass analysis of aS samples analyzed in the presence of DHA or AA are reported in Table 2. In particular, species containing oxidations (+16 Da or multiple of 16) and covalent adducts with DHA (+326 Da) or AA (+304 Da) are present. For the purpose of the present work, the samples were analyzed only up to 24 h of incubation, because aS aggregates and forms oligomers upon prolonged incubation in the presence of fatty acids, as previously observed, and other modifications can occur (29De Franceschi G.

Open table in a new tab To identify the site of modification in the aS sequence, fingerprinting analysis by trypsin and endoproteinase GluC was performed. These proteases selectively cleave the peptide bonds involving basic and glutamic acid residues, respectively (Fig. 3). A RP-HPLC fraction enriched of the chemically modified aS with DHA was digested by trypsin, using an enzyme to substrate ratio (E/S) of 1:100, or by GluC, using an E/S of 1:50. The proteolytic fragments were purified by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3, A and B) and identified by MS (Table 3, Table 4). In the tryptic mixture, fragments 1–6, 1–60, 81–140, and 98–140, containing Met residues are present also in oxidized form (+16 Da), whereas fragments corresponding to sequences 1–60, 35–80, 46–80, and 46–58 were found with a mass increase of 326 Da. The residues, susceptible of modification, present in all the detected modified peptides are His and Lys. His as a nucleophile is stronger than Lys, and it is consequently more prone to be modified. To confirm this hypothesis, MS-MS analysis of the modified fragments was performed. In Fig. 3C, the MS-MS spectrum of the peptide-(46–58) + 326, the shortest modified peptide, is reported. The analysis was conducted on its double charged ion at m/z 811.4. The spectrum does not show signals relative to the series of y- or b-ions, but products of partial degradation (m/z 754.33, 762.95, and 781.89) together with a strong ion at m/z 648.39 corresponding to the double charged ion of the peptide-(46–58) without the covalent adduct (Fig. 3C). The species at m/z 781.89 is particularly interesting, because it is produced for removal of the moiety CH2COOH (59 Da), partially confirming the identity of the modified peptide. From the other hand, it was not possible to obtain direct evidence of which specific amino acid has reacted with the fatty acid, because the energy used for the collision of the double charged ions produces ions corresponding to the peptide without modification (m/z 648.39). Indeed, the MS-MS spectrum of the ion at m/z 648.39 confirms the identity of the peptide (Fig. 3D). In the proteolytic mixture of modified aS with DHA by GluC, an increase of 326 Da was found on the mass of peptides corresponding to 36–61 and 29–57 after a 5-min reaction (data not shown) and to 47–57 after a 70-min reaction (Fig. 3B, Table 4). This last peptide, which does not contain Lys, provides direct evidence that His-50 is modified, even if, also in this case, a MS-MS spectrum was not obtained. Moreover, no fragments containing only Lys (and not His) were found modified.Table 3Chemical characterization of fragments corresponding to the peaks of the chromatogram relative to the fragmentation of aS/DHA with trypsin shown in Fig. 3ARTaPeptides are listed in order of retention times (RT).Molecular mass (Da)Peptide speciesdThe modified peptides are highlighted in bold.FoundbExperimental molecular masses determined by ESI-MS.CalculatedcMolecular masses calculated from aS amino acid sequence.min11.2830.43 (±0.01)829.9124–3213.21294.99 (±0.05)1294.6846–581524.16 (±0.01)1523.7444–581620.8 (±0.1)1621.4646–58 + 3261754.37 (±0.02)1754.0244–6013.81179.93 (±0.05)1179.6535–451406.9 (±0.1)1408.6933–4514.1785.88 (±0.11)785.981–6 + 1ox801.78 (±0.12)801.981–6 + 2ox950.7 (±0.1)950.0935–4314.72157.17 (±0.04)2157.4559–8014.9769.88 (±0.1)769.981–61607.16 (±0.01)1606.8481–9715.12148.14 (±0.11)2148.4481–10215.41928.41 (±0.05)1928.1761–8015.61478.05 (±0.04)1478.6681–964923.6 (±0.1)4923.2535–80 + 32617.94847.06 (±0.38)4846.0398–140 + 1ox6150.38 (±0.1)6149.181–606167.3 (±0.5)6165.181–60 + 1ox6472.55 (±0.75)6475.181–60 + 32619.34958.66 (±0.01)4958.2097–14019.94288.74 (±0.34)4288.43103–1404830.5 (±0.1)4830.0398–14021.26434.93 (±0.04)6434.8681–140 + 1ox6451.22 (±0.46)6450.8681–140 + 2ox23.46418.65 (±0.13)6418.8681–14028.23434.52 (±0.05)3434.8946–803760.8 (±0.1)3760.8946–80 + 3263664.32 (±0.01)3664.1844–80a Peptides are listed in order of retention times (R"

https://openalex.org/W2589782040,"Recently, we demonstrated that heat shock protein (HSP)-27 is protective against the development of experimental atherosclerosis, reducing plaque cholesterol content by more than 30%. Moreover, elevated HSP-27 levels are predictive of relative freedom from clinical cardiovascular events. HSP-27 signaling occurs via the activation of NF-kB, which induces a marked up-regulation in expression of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a cytokine that is known to alter ABC transporters involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Therefore, we hypothesized that HSP-27-derived GM-CSF has a potent role in impeding plaque formation by promoting macrophage RCT and sought to better characterize this pathway. Treatment of THP-1 cells, RAW-Blue cells, and primary macrophages with recombinant HSP-27 resulted in NF-kB activation via TLR-4 and was inhibited by various pharmacologic blockers of this pathway. Moreover, HSP-27-induced upregulation of GM-CSF expression was dependent on TLR-4 signaling. Recombinant (r)HSP-27 treatment of ApoE−/− female (but not male) mice for 4 wk yielded reductions in plaque area and cholesterol clefts of 33 and 47%, respectively, with no effect on GM-CSF−/−ApoE−/− mice. With 12 wk of rHSP-27 treatment, both female and male mice showed reductions in plaque burden (55 and 42%, respectively) and a 60% reduction in necrotic core area but no treatment effect in GM-CSF−/−ApoE−/− mice. In vitro functional studies revealed that HSP-27 enhanced the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, as well as facilitated cholesterol efflux in vitro by ∼10%. These novel findings establish a paradigm for HSP-27-mediated RCT and set the stage for the development of HSP-27 atheroprotective therapeutics.—Pulakazhi Venu, V.

https://openalex.org/W2591081286,"Nicotiana benthamiana is employed around the world for many types of research and one transgenic line has been used more extensively than any other. This line, 16c, expresses the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP), highly and constitutively, and has been a major resource for visualising the mobility and actions of small RNAs. Insights into the mechanisms studied at a molecular level in N. benthamiana 16c are likely to be deeper and more accurate with a greater knowledge of the GFP gene integration site. Therefore, using next generation sequencing, genome mapping and local alignment, we identified the location and characteristics of the integrated T-DNA. As suggested from previous molecular hybridisation and inheritance data, the transgenic line contains a single GFP-expressing locus. However, the GFP coding sequence differs from that originally reported. Furthermore, a 3.2 kb portion of a transposon, appears to have co-integrated with the T-DNA. The location of the integration mapped to a region of the genome represented by Nbv0.5scaffold4905 in the www.benthgenome.com assembly, and with less integrity to Niben101Scf03641 in the www.solgenomics.net assembly. The transposon is not endogenous to laboratory strains of N. benthamiana or Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (MP90), which was reportedly used in the generation of line 16c. However, it is present in the popular LBA4404 strain. The integrated transposon sequence includes its 5' terminal repeat and a transposase gene, and is immediately adjacent to the GFP gene. This unexpected genetic arrangement may contribute to the characteristics that have made the 16c line such a popular research tool and alerts researchers, taking transgenic plants to commercial release, to be aware of this genomic hitchhiker."
https://openalex.org/W2591566179,"All-trans-retinoic acid (RA), a bioactive derivative of vitamin A, exhibits diverse effects on gene transcription and non-genomic regulatory pathways. The steady-state levels of RA are therefore tightly controlled, but the mechanisms responsible for RA homeostasis are not fully understood. We report a molecular mechanism that allows cells to maintain a stable rate of RA biosynthesis by utilizing a biological circuit generated by a bifunctional retinoid oxidoreductive complex (ROC). We show that ROC is composed of at least two subunits of NAD+-dependent retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10), which catalyzes the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, and two subunits of NADPH-dependent dehydrogenase reductase 3 (DHRS3), which catalyzes the reduction of retinaldehyde back to retinol. RDH10 and DHRS3 also exist as homo-oligomers. When complexed, RDH10 and DHRS3 mutually activate and stabilize each other. These features of ROC ensure that the rate of RA biosynthesis in whole cells is largely independent of the concentration of the individual ROC components. ROC operates in various subcellular fractions including microsomes, mitochondria, and lipid droplets; however, lipid droplets display weaker mutual activation between RDH10 and DHRS3, suggesting reduced formation of ROC. Importantly, disruption of the ROC-generated circuit by a knockdown of DHRS3 results in an increased flux through the RA biosynthesis pathway and elevated RA levels despite the decrease in RDH10 protein destabilized by the absence of DHRS3, hence demonstrating a loss of control. Thus, the bifunctional nature of ROC provides the RA-based signaling system with robustness by safeguarding appropriate RA concentration despite naturally occurring fluctuations in RDH10 and DHRS3."

Here we show that the expression levels of the disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L) are significantly reduced in the liver of obese mice and humans. Liver-specific knockout or adenovirus-mediated overexpression of DsbA-L exacerbates or alleviates, respectively, high-fat diet-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance in mice. Mechanistically, we found that DsbA-L is localized in mitochondria and that its deficiency is associated with impairment of maximum respiratory capacity, elevated cellular oxidative stress, and increased JNK activity. Our results identify DsbA-L as a critical regulator of mitochondrial function, and its down-regulation in the liver may contribute to obesity-induced hepatosteatosis and whole body insulin resistance.-Chen, H., Bai, J., Dong, F., Fang, H., Zhang, Y., Meng, W., Liu, B., Luo, Y., Liu, M., Bai, Y., Abdul-Ghani, M.

Herein, the sterol-responsive Liver X Receptors (LXRs) play an important role owing to their ability to reduce cellular cholesterol load. In this context, identifying the full set of LXR-regulated genes will contribute to our understanding of their role in cholesterol metabolism. Using global transcriptional analysis we report here the identification of RNF145 as an LXR-regulated target gene. We demonstrate that RNF145 is regulated by LXRs in both human and mouse primary cells and cell lines, and in vivo in mice. Regulation of RNF145 by LXR depends on a functional LXR-element in its proximal promotor. Consistent with LXR-dependent regulation of Rnf145 we show that regulation is lost in macrophages and fibroblasts from Lxrαβ(-/-) mice, and also in vivo in livers of Lxrα(-/-) mice treated with the LXR synthetic ligand T0901317. RNF145 is closely related to RNF139/TRC8, an E3 ligase implicated in control of SREBP processing. However, silencing of RNF145 in HepG2 or HeLa cells does not impair SREBP1/2 processing and sterol-responsive gene expression in these cells. Similar to TRC8, we demonstrate that RNF145 is localized to the ER and that it possesses intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In summary, we report the identification of RNF145 as an ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase that is transcriptionally controlled by LXR."

Therefore, inhibitors of disulfide bond formation enzymes could have profound effects on pathogen virulence. In the Escherichia coli disulfide bond formation pathway, the periplasmic protein DsbA introduces disulfide bonds into substrates, and then the cytoplasmic membrane protein DsbB reoxidizes DsbA's cysteines regenerating its activity. Thus, DsbB generates a protein disulfide bond de novo by transferring electrons to the quinone pool. We previously identified an effective pyridazinone-related inhibitor of DsbB enzymes from several Gram-negative bacteria. To map the protein residues that are important for the interaction with this inhibitor, we randomly mutagenized by error-prone PCR the E. coli dsbB gene and selected dsbB mutants that confer resistance to this drug using two approaches. We characterized in vivo and in vitro some of these mutants that map to two areas in the structure of DsbB, one located between the two first transmembrane segments where the quinone ring binds and the other located in the second periplasmic loop of DsbB, which interacts with DsbA. In addition, we show that a mutant version of a protein involved in lipopolysaccharide assembly, lptD4213, is synthetically lethal with the deletion of dsbB as well as with DsbB inhibitors. This finding suggests that drugs decreasing LptD assembly may be synthetically lethal with inhibitors of the Dsb pathway, potentiating the antibiotic effects."

Small but critical sequence differences in CO1 were observed between gDNA and cDNA from N. plumchrus. Furthermore, careful observation revealed the presence of recombination between sequences in gDNA from N. plumchrus. Moreover, a chimera of the N. cristatus and N. plumchrus sequences was obtained from N. plumchrus gDNA. The observed phenomena can be best explained by the preferential amplification of the nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes from gDNA of N. plumchrus. Two conclusions can be drawn from the observations. First, nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes are pervasive in N. plumchrus. Second, a mating between a female N. cristatus and a male N. plumchrus produced viable offspring, which further backcrossed to a N. plumchrus individual. These observations not only demonstrate intriguing mating behavior in these species, but also emphasize the importance of careful interpretation of species marker sequences amplified from gDNA."

To investigate if Twitter data can be useful for the detection and monitoring of biosecurity events, we adopted a three-step process. First, we confirmed that sightings of two migratory species, the Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa) and the Common Koel (Eudynamys scolopaceus) are reported on Twitter. Second, we developed search queries to extract the relevant tweets for these species. The queries were based on either the taxonomic name, common name or keywords that are frequently used to describe the species (symptomatic or syndromic). Third, we validated the results using ground truth data. Our results indicate that the common name queries provided a reasonable number of tweets that were related to the ground truth data. The taxonomic query resulted in too small datasets, while the symptomatic queries resulted in large datasets, but with highly variable signal-to-noise ratios. No clear relationship was observed between the tweets from the symptomatic queries and the ground truth data. Comparing the results for the two species showed that the level of familiarity with the species plays a major role. The more familiar the species, the more stable and reliable the Twitter data. This clearly presents a problem for using social media to detect the arrival of an exotic organism of biosecurity concern for which public is unfamiliar."

In this paper, we develop a novel nonlinear registration framework based on the diffeomorphic demons, where a reciprocal regularizer is introduced to assume that the deformation between two images is an exact diffeomorphism. In detail, first, we adopt a bidirectional metric to improve the symmetry of the energy functional, whose variables are two reciprocal deformations. Secondly, we slack these two deformations into two independent variables and introduce a reciprocal regularizer to assure the deformations being the exact diffeomorphism. Then, we utilize an alternating iterative strategy to decouple the model into two minimizing subproblems, where a new closed form for the approximate velocity of deformation is calculated. Finally, we compare our proposed algorithm on two data sets of real brain MR images with two relative and conventional methods. The results validate that our proposed method improves accuracy and robustness of registration, as well as the gained bidirectional deformations are actually reciprocal."
https://openalex.org/W2591082334,"The signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized in animals by structurally related NO synthases (NOSs), which contain NADPH/FAD- and FMN-binding domains. During catalysis, NADPH-derived electrons transfer into FAD and then distribute into the FMN domain for further transfer to internal or external heme groups. Conformational freedom of the FMN domain is thought to be essential for the electron transfer (ET) reactions in NOSs. To directly examine this concept, we utilized a Cys-lite neuronal NOS flavoprotein domain and substituted Cys for two residues (Glu-816 and Arg-1229) forming a salt bridge between the NADPH/FAD and FMN domains in the conformationally closed structure to allow cross-domain disulfide bond formation or cross-linking by bismaleimides of various lengths. The disulfide bond cross-link caused a ≥95% loss of cytochrome c reductase activity that was reversible with DTT treatment, whereas graded cross-link lengthening gradually increased activity, thus defining the conformational constraints in the catalytic process. We used spectroscopic and stopped-flow techniques to further investigate how the changes in FMN domain conformational freedom impact the following: (i) the NADPH interaction; (ii) kinetics of electron loading (flavin reduction); (iii) stabilization of open versus closed conformational forms in two different flavin redox states; (iv) reactivity of the reduced FMN domain toward cytochrome c; (v) response to calmodulin binding; and (vi) the rates of interflavin ET and the FMN domain conformational dynamics. Together, our findings help explain how the spatial and temporal behaviors of the FMN domain impact catalysis by the NOS flavoprotein domain and how these behaviors are governed to enable electron flow through the enzyme."

At issue is whether Broad piggybacked on UC’s inventions when its researchers showed that CRISPR worked in human cells, which is critical for making new medicines. The appeal board said no, dismissing UC’s interference complaint. But the board did not rule on the actual claims made by each party, which leaves open the confusing possibility that UC will hold a patent for use of CRISPR in any type of cell and Broad will own the intellectual property to eukaryotic cells alone. Any way about it, companies that have licensed the technology are scrambling to figure out whom they have to pay fees to, and the uncertainly likely will continue unless UC and Broad can agree on a “cross-licensing” settlement that, in effect, shares the patent revenues.

Mast cells are white blood cells that are perhaps best known for their role in allergic responses and asthma. Leoni et al. now show that the enzyme DNMT3A limits mast cell activity following acute and chronic inflammation. Using mice deficient in DNMT3A, the authors found exaggerated mast cell responses to skin allergy. Inactivation of DNMT3A was associated with increased cytokine production, enhanced mast cell degranulation, and aberrant expression of the IQGAP2 scaffold protein. A number of hematological disorders have been associated with mutations in DNA methylation enzymes, and the current studies highlight a broader role for containing immune responses.

Synthetic RNA aptamers can be selected against a target, but it is difficult to integrate these artificial sensors into cells. Porter et al. started with scaffolds derived from two different riboswitches and a ribozyme that all contain a recurrent motif. They made libraries designed to maintain the structure, but with sufficient diversity to select sequences that would bind precursors of serotonin and dopamine. They obtained a diverse set of aptamers that selectively bind their target and can be coupled to a fluorophore binding domain for readout. The suite of aptamers could potentially be combinatorially coupled to communication modules to rapidly screen for sequences with a required activity.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition occurs when epithelial cells lose apicobasal polarity and cell-cell contacts and migrate into surrounding tissues as mesenchymal cells. Migration is crucial for gastrulation, neural tube formation, and cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying loss of polarity and cell movement are poorly understood. Burute et al. show that the centrosome position in epithelial cells changes from the periphery to the center of mesenchymal cells. The change in cell organization results in the transition from apicobasal polarity to front-rear polarity that precedes cell migration. Micropatterned cell culture showed that the mechanism is cell-intrinsic and governed by microtubule reorganization but is not influenced by neighboring cells.

https://openalex.org/W2589370389,"Thomas Schelling, the distinguished economist, died on 13 December 2016 at his home in Bethesda, Maryland. He was 95 years old. Schelling applied his prolific work in game theory to arms control and deterrence, negotiation strategy, and most recently, global warming. His strategic insights made the world a much safer place.

Schelling was born and raised in California, the son of a naval officer and a school teacher. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1944 and earned his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1951. As a young economist, he served first overseas with the Marshall Plan and then in Truman's White House. After a brief sojourn at Yale University, he returned to Harvard as an economics professor in 1958, where he spent decades exploring game theory concepts such as focal points (the solution that seems natural to two parties who seek to cooperate without communication), tacit (unspoken) communication more generally, and the enormous gains that cooperation with one's enemy can produce. In 1990, he joined the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, where he continued to research and to teach until he retired in 2005.

That same year, the Nobel Committee awarded the Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences to Schelling and Robert Aumann, noting the “great relevance [of their game theory work] for conflict resolution and efforts to avoid war.” Surely Schelling's greatest contribution to the world was providing both conceptual and practical recommendations that reduced, over many decades, the likelihood of nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia. His work also shaped his field. Mathematical game theorist and Nobel laureate Roger Myerson observed in a 2009 article in the Journal of Economic Literature that “the development of general models in game theory after 1960 was decisively influenced by Schelling's Strategy of Conflict ,” a book Myerson labeled “one of the most important and influential books in the history of social science.”

Schelling investigated the world around him at a large scale, with his decades-long efforts to avert nuclear war and to curb climate change, and at a small scale, with his analyses of the often counterproductive behaviors of individuals and groups. His prime area of interest was the interactions between parties. Whether his subject was a parent coaxing better behavior from a child, or the forces that produced greater segregation in neighborhoods and high school lunchrooms than most participants desired, or nations trying to eliminate mutually destructive activities (such as the profligate release of greenhouse gases), his goals remained the same. Schelling worked to understand a phenomenon at a fundamental level, to find ways to ensure better outcomes, and to generalize the findings to a broad array of contexts. Paul Samuelson, a fellow economist and Nobel laureate, once remarked that Schelling “couldn't help having original ideas.” His mind nimbly stepped from observation to detection, reflection, and simplification. His analyses invariably ended with generalization to other areas, often illuminating critical policy issues. All was presented in memorable prose.

Schelling's scholarship yielded piercing insights. For instance, parent-child interactions revealed a hidden truth: The key ingredient of a parent's effective threat or promise was to lower one of his or her own payoffs (e.g., by increasing embarrassment should he or she not keep a promise), usually by making a verbal commitment. That would make it worthwhile for the parent to take a previously less attractive action and fulfill an otherwise costly promise when the child complied. Schelling analyzed the parent's need to carry out a threat, because failure to do so would embarrass the parent in the short term and would sap his or her credibility in the long term. Although humans have always made threats and promises, Schelling revealed those tactics' concealed underpinnings. He then parlayed this insight into a discussion of its policy import in numerous other contexts, such as threat credibility in international relations.

At Harvard, Schelling gained recognition as a professor unique in both subject matter and style of thinking, as illustrated in his books. He was a gifted teacher in the classroom and the seminar room, at Harvard and subsequently at the University of Maryland, and to the world through his engaging yet accessible writings. He inspired his students to grapple with the world and to think creatively. Many who came to know him were equally inspired by his remarkable generosity. For example, he often returned students' and colleagues' papers with several pages of helpful, single-spaced comments. As his student, undergraduate and graduate, then long-term colleague and lifetime friend, I benefited often from his generous wisdom.

Schelling's colleagues knew that they should wait until the end of a seminar for the climactic event when he would finally speak. His encouraging smile would be followed by perfect remarks, kind yet penetrating. Schelling's analysis often related the analyzed phenomenon to an everyday situation which, he showed, had parallels to critical international and domestic policy issues and whose outcomes, he demonstrated, could be improved by attention to some aspect of the presenter's analysis. The presenter, though dazzled by the on-the-spot brilliance of this response, would be enriched by an enhanced conceptual model, important illustrations, and useful policy prescriptions.

Although retired, Schelling continued his work until his death. He leaves behind two papers on climate change that he was preparing for publication. His passion, eloquence, and generosity will always be remembered by his colleagues, family, and friends. Millions more may have him and his work to thank for having been spared a nuclear cataclysm.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) show a generally conserved stress response, interacting with specific chaperone proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, studies of the heat shock response (HSR) tend to be performed in unicellular organisms or tissue culture. To test whether the HSR is global or tissue-specific, Ma et al. examined HSR and specificity in muscle and intestine in Caenorhabditis elegans. They observed that the tissue specificity of the HSR was determined by the ratio of the specific proteome of each tissue relative to associated HSP chaperone proteins. On the basis of these findings, the authors suggest that some tissue-specific human disease may be explained by similar mechanisms.

Birdja and Koper show in studies with boron-doped diamond electrodes that aldehydes are the direct product of CO2 reduction and that primary alcohols and carboxylic acids form through Cannizzaro-type disproportionation (thus, methanol and formic acid form from formaldehyde). These reactions are unexpected because they require base, but the HER creates OH− as a by-product, so regions near the electrode can be at high pH. Such reactions are inhibited in buffered electrolytes, which the authors recommend to sort out direct and indirect product formation mechanisms.
