https://openalex.org/W2901817564,"Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infect more than 400 million people each year with dangerous viral pathogens including dengue, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya. Progress in understanding the biology of mosquitoes and developing the tools to fight them has been slowed by the lack of a high-quality genome assembly. Here we combine diverse technologies to produce the markedly improved, fully re-annotated AaegL5 genome assembly, and demonstrate how it accelerates mosquito science. We anchored physical and cytogenetic maps, doubled the number of known chemosensory ionotropic receptors that guide mosquitoes to human hosts and egg-laying sites, provided further insight into the size and composition of the sex-determining M locus, and revealed copy-number variation among glutathione S-transferase genes that are important for insecticide resistance. Using high-resolution quantitative trait locus and population genomic analyses, we mapped new candidates for dengue vector competence and insecticide resistance. AaegL5 will catalyse new biological insights and intervention strategies to fight this deadly disease vector. An improved, fully re-annotated Aedes aegypti genome assembly (AaegL5) provides insights into the sex-determining M locus, chemosensory systems that help mosquitoes to hunt humans and loci involved in insecticide resistance and will help to generate intervention strategies to fight this deadly disease vector."
https://openalex.org/W2898375074,"Innate immune memory is an emerging area of research. However, innate immune memory at major mucosal sites remains poorly understood. Here, we show that respiratory viral infection induces long-lasting memory alveolar macrophages (AMs). Memory AMs are programed to express high MHC II, a defense-ready gene signature, and increased glycolytic metabolism, and produce, upon re-stimulation, neutrophil chemokines. Using a multitude of approaches, we reveal that the priming, but not maintenance, of memory AMs requires the help from effector CD8 T cells. T cells jump-start this process via IFN-γ production. We further find that formation and maintenance of memory AMs are independent of monocytes or bone marrow progenitors. Finally, we demonstrate that memory AMs are poised for robust trained immunity against bacterial infection in the lung via rapid induction of chemokines and neutrophilia. Our study thus establishes a new paradigm of immunological memory formation whereby adaptive T-lymphocytes render innate memory of mucosal-associated macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2900807097,"Introduction Many countries have developed guidelines advocating for responsible reporting of suicidal behaviour in traditional media. However, the increasing popularity of social media, particularly among young people, means that complementary guidelines designed to facilitate safe peer-peer communication are required. The aim of this study was to develop a set of evidence informed guidelines to assist young people to communicate about suicide via social media with the input of young people as active participants of the study. Methods Systematic searches of the peer-reviewed and grey literature were conducted resulting in a 284-item questionnaire identifying strategies for safe communication about suicide online. The questionnaire was delivered over two rounds to two panels consisting of Australian youth advocates; and international suicide prevention researchers and media and communications specialists. Items were rerated if they were endorsed by 70–79.5% of both panels, or if 80% or more of one panel rated the item as essential or important. All items that were endorsed as essential or important by at least 80% of both panels were included in the final guidelines. Results A total of 173 items were included in the final guidelines. These items were organised into the following five sections: 1) Before you post anything online about suicide; 2) Sharing your own thoughts, feelings, or experience with suicidal behaviour online; 3) Communicating about someone you know who is affected by suicidal thoughts, feelings or behaviours; 4) Responding to someone who may be suicidal; 5) Memorial websites, pages and closed groups to honour the deceased. Discussion This is the first study to develop a set of evidence-informed guidelines to support young people to talk safely about suicide on social media. It is hoped that they will be a useful resource for young people and those who support them (e.g., parents, teachers, community workers and health professionals)."
https://openalex.org/W2901241683,"The organization of work has undergone vast transformations over the past four decades in the United States and has had profound impacts on worker health and wellbeing. The profession of commercial truck driving is one of the best examples. Particularly for long-haul truck drivers, changes in work organization have led to disproportionately poor physiological, psychological, and sleep health outcomes.The present study examined disparities in cardiometabolic disease risk among long-haul truck drivers and the general population, and the influence of work organization and sleep in generating these outcomes. Researchers collected survey data from 260 drivers, and blood assay samples from 115 of those drivers, at a large highway truck stop in North Carolina. Comparisons were made for cardiovascular and metabolic risk against the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In addition, logistic regression was used to explore predictive relationships between work organization and sleep and risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease.There were statistically significant mean differences between the long-haul truck driver sample and the NHANES sample for both cardiovascular (3.71 vs. 3.10; p <0.001) and metabolic (4.31 vs. 3.09; p <0.001) disease risk. The truck driver sample was less physically active and had lower HDL cholesterol along with greater levels of smoking, BMI, and metabolic syndrome diagnosis. More years of driving experience and poor sleep quality were statistically significant predictors for both cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk.Study findings implicate elements of the occupational milieu experienced by long-haul truck drivers that induce disproportionate cardiometabolic disease risk. Sleep quality, largely compromised by poor work conditions and workplace environments, plays a significant role in increased risks for cardiometabolic disease. There is an urgent need for longitudinal studies of this critical occupational sector as well as intervention research centered on policy and systems level change."
https://openalex.org/W2901658451,"Oral microbiota consists of hundreds of different species of bacteria, fungi, protozoa and archaea, important for oral health. Oral mycoses, mostly affecting mucosae, are mainly caused by the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. They become relevant in denture-wearers elderly people, in diabetic patients, and in immunocompromised individuals. Differently, bacteria are responsible for other pathologies, such as dental caries, gingivitis and periodontitis, which affect even immune-competent individuals. An appropriate oral hygiene can avoid (or at least ameliorate) such pathologies: the regular and correct use of toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash helps prevent oral infections. Interestingly, little or no information is available on the effects (if any) of mouthwashes on the composition of oral microbiota in healthy individuals. Therefore, by means of in vitro models, we assessed the effects of alcohol-free commercial mouthwashes, with different composition (4 with chlorhexidine digluconate, 1 with fluoride, 1 with essential oils, 1 with cetylpyridinium chloride and 1 with triclosan), on several virulence traits of C. albicans, and a group of viridans streptococci, commonly colonizing the oral cavity. For the study here described, a reference strain of C. albicans and of streptococci isolates from pharyngeal swabs were used. Chlorhexidine digluconate- and cetylpyridinium chloride-containing mouthwashes were the most effective in impairing C. albicans capacity to adhere to both abiotic and biotic surfaces, to elicit proinflammatory cytokine secretion by oral epithelial cells and to escape intracellular killing by phagocytes. In addition, these same mouthwashes were effective in impairing biofilm formation by a group of viridans streptococci that, notoriously, cooperate with the cariogenic S. mutans, facilitating the establishment of biofilm by the latter. Differently, these mouthwashes were ineffective against other viridans streptococci that are natural competitors of S. mutans. Finally, by an in vitro model of mixed biofilm, we showed that mouthwashes-treated S. salivarius overall failed to impair C. albicans capacity to form a biofilm. In conclusion, the results described here suggest that chlorhexidine- and cetylpyridinium-containing mouthwashes may be effective in regulating microbial homeostasis of the oral cavity, by providing a positive balance for oral health. On the other side, chlorhexidine has several side effects that must be considered when prescribing mouthwashes containing this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2901891997,"Malaria parasites remodel their host erythrocytes to gain nutrients and avoid the immune system. Host erythrocytes are modified by hundreds of effector proteins exported from the parasite into the host cell. Protein export is mediated by the PTEX translocon comprising five core components of which EXP2 is considered to form the putative pore that spans the vacuole membrane enveloping the parasite within its erythrocyte. To explore the function and importance of EXP2 for parasite survival in the asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum we inducibly knocked down the expression of EXP2. Reduction in EXP2 expression strongly reduced parasite growth proportional to the degree of protein knockdown and tended to stall development about half way through the asexual cell cycle. Once the knockdown inducer was removed and EXP2 expression restored, parasite growth recovered dependent upon the length and degree of knockdown. To establish EXP2 function and hence the basis for growth reduction, the trafficking of an exported protein was monitored following EXP2 knockdown. This resulted in severe attenuation of protein export and is consistent with EXP2, and PTEX in general, being the conduit for export of proteins into the host compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2901877326,"The present study aimed to investigate the periodontal regenerative effect of enamel matrix derivative (EMD) in diabetes. Thirty-six rats were assigned to streptozotocin-induced diabetes or control (non-diabetic) groups. Three-wall intrabony defects were surgically generated in the bilateral maxilla molar, followed by application of EMD or saline. Primary wound closure and defect fill were evaluated via histomorphological analysis and micro-computed tomography. mRNA expression levels of inflammatory and angiogenic factors in the defects were quantified via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gingival fibroblasts were isolated from control animals and cultured in high-glucose (HG) or control medium. The effects of EMD on insulin resistance and PI3K/Akt/VEGF signaling were evaluated. The achievement rate of primary closure and the parameters of defect fill were significantly higher at EMD-treated site than at EMD-untreated sites in both diabetic and non-diabetic rats, although defect fill in the diabetic groups was significantly lower in the control groups on two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (for both, p<0.05). Newly formed bone and cementum were significantly increased at EMD-treated sites in diabetic rats than at EMD-untreated sites in control rats (for both, p<0.05). Vegf was significantly upregulated at EMD-treated sites in both diabetic and non-diabetic rats (for both, p<0.05). In vitro, insulin or EMD-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly lower in cells cultured in HG medium (p<0.05). EMD-mediated Vegf upregulation was suppressed by the Akt inhibitor wortmannin, although the effect was significantly lower in HG medium (p<0.01). In conclusion, EMD might promote periodontal tissue regeneration via Akt/VEGF signaling, even in a diabetic condition."
https://openalex.org/W2901945356,"Background Prenatal stress affects the health of the pregnant woman and the fetus. Cortisol blood levels are elevated in pregnancy, and fetal exposure to cortisol is regulated by the placenta enzyme 11β-HSD2. A decrease in enzyme activity allows more maternal cortisol to pass through the placental barrier. Combining the fetal and maternal cortisol to cortisone ratio into the adjusted fetal cortisol exposure (AFCE) represents the activity of the enzyme 11β-HSD2 in the placenta. Aim To investigate the effect of prenatal maternal stress on the ratio of cortisol and cortisone in maternal and fetal blood at birth in a normal population. Method Maternal self-reported stress was assessed at one time-point, as late in the pregnancy as convenient for the participant, using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42), Pregnancy Related Anxiety (PRA), and Major Life Events during pregnancy. The study included 273 participants from Copenhagen University Hospital. Maternal and umbilical cord blood was sampled directly after birth and cortisol and cortisone concentrations were quantified using UPLC chromatography. Data were analyzed in a five-step regression model with addition of possible confounders. The primary outcome was AFCE, and plasma concentrations of maternal and fetal cortisol and cortisone were secondary outcomes. Results Significant associations were seen for the primary outcome AFCE and the plasma concentrations of maternal cortisol and fetal cortisone with exposure to Pregnancy Related Anxiety (PRA), though the associations were reduced when adjusting for birth related variables, especially delivery mode. The weight of the placenta affected the associations of exposures on AFCE, but not plasma concentrations of cortisol and cortisone in mother and fetus. Moreover, the study demonstrated the importance of delivery mode and birth strain on cortisol levels right after delivery. Conclusion Our main finding was associations between PRA and AFCE, which shows the effect of maternal stress on placental cortisol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2900813741,"Pollinosis caused by Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) is a widespread social problem in Japan. To date, 23 male-sterile C. japonica trees have been selected in Japan to address pollinosis, from which four male-sterility loci (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4) have been identified from test crossing results. For efficient breeding of male-sterile C. japonica trees, more male-sterile individuals and individuals heterozygous for male-sterile genes are required. Therefore, we aimed to develop DNA markers for marker-assisted selection of four types of male-sterile genes from populations without a family structure. First, for four families exhibiting segregation of each male-sterile locus (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4), genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism and insertion/deletion (indel) genotyping was performed using the Axiom myDesign Targeted Genotyping Array method. Four high-density linkage maps for mapping the MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4 families were constructed, which included 4923, 1722, 1896, and 2247 markers, respectively. In these maps, 15, 4, 2, and 2 markers were located 0.0, 3.3, 1.1, and 0.0 cM from the MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4 loci, respectively. Second, for the markers located 0.0 cM from a male-sterile locus (i.e., MS1 and MS4), to clarify the most tightly linked markers, we calculated the prediction rate of male-sterile gene genotypes from marker genotypes for 78 trees. The markers with the highest prediction rates were AX-174127446 (0.95) for MS1 and AX-174121522 (1.00) for MS4. The AX-174121522 marker was considered to be suitable for selecting trees homozygous or heterozygous for the MS4 gene from plus-trees without a pollination test, which requires a large amount of time and effort. The nearest markers to the male-sterile loci found in this study may facilitate the isolation of male-sterile genes in C. japonica via combination with the draft genomic sequence that is currently being collated."
https://openalex.org/W2901122117,"Objectives Understanding respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) morbidity may help to plan health care and future vaccine recommendations. We aim to describe the characteristics and temporal distribution of children diagnosed with RSV admitted in a Spanish hospital. Methods Descriptive study for which the hospital discharges of children < 5 years of age with RSV infection were analyzed. The information was extracted from the hospital discharge database of a reference pediatric hospital in northern Spain for the 2010–2011 to 2014–2015 RSV seasons. Results Six hundred and forty-seven hospitalizations of children with RSV infection were analyzed, 94% of which occurred between the second week of November and the last week of March. Most children (72%) were under one year of age and 95% were previously healthy infants. Infants born from October to December had the highest risk of hospitalization in the first year of life. The median length of hospital stay of children with and without comorbidities was six and three days, respectively. 6.5% of the hospitalized cases were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit; this percentage was higher among children < 2 months (adjusted odds ratio 4.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.37–12.61) or with comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio 4.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.53–11.28). The case lethality was 0.3%. Conclusions The risk of hospitalizations for RSV is high during the first year of life and increases among infants born in the fall. Being under two months of age and presenting comorbidities are the main risk factors associated to pediatric intensive care unit admission."
https://openalex.org/W2901733509,"Background Most patients with distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma have developed jaundice or cholangitis at the time of initial diagnosis, which can delay surgery. We aim to evaluate the actual EB-RFA ablation volume and validated the clinical feasibility of preoperative endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (EB-RFA) for resectable distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Methods The medical records of patients who underwent EB-RFA from July 2016 to June 2017 at a single tertiary academic medical center were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were patients with resectable distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who required preoperative biliary decompression. Clinical outcomes of EB-RFA were reviewed retrospectively and the surgical specimens were reevaluated. Results Of the eight patients who required a delayed operation, preoperative EB-RFA was successfully performed without serious complications including peritonitis, hemobilia, or perforation. Although curative resection was attempted in all patients, one patient underwent open and closure due to hepatic metastasis. Seven patients underwent curative surgical resection and the histology revealed that median maximal ablation depth was 4.0 mm (range, 1–6) and median effective ablation length (histological ablation length/fluorosocopic ablation length) was 72.0% (range, 42.1–95.3). Conclusions EB-RFA partially ablated human cancer tissue and preoperative EB-RFA might be a safe and feasible in patients with distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who require a delayed operation. Ablation of the target lesion longer than the estimated length by fluoroscopy may improve the efficacy of EB-RFA."
https://openalex.org/W2900969413,"Obesity and loneliness are associated with C-reactive protein (CRP), a predictor of cardiovascular disease. It is unknown whether the co-presence of obesity and loneliness is associated with additional risk for clinically elevated CRP. The present study thus examines their independent and combined effects on elevated CRP in older adults. Data come from 10,912 respondents who completed the 2008 and 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. Loneliness was measured using an 11-item Loneliness Scale and body mass index was calculated from technician measured height and weight. Our primary outcome is high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). Survey-weighted logistic regression models were used to test whether loneliness and BMI category are independent predictors of CRP after adjusting for demographics and other inflammatory-related covariates. In the fully adjusted model for men, obesity (OR = 2.36, p < .0001) was associated with increased odds of hsCRP >3.0. Among females, being overweight (OR = 1.75, p < .0001) or obese (OR = 4.01, p < .0001) were associated increased odds of hsCRP>3.0. Among both men and women, results from fully adjusted models indicated that loneliness was not associated with clinically elevated hsCRP (OR = 1.34, p = .0535; OR = 0.97, p = 0.6776, respectively)."
https://openalex.org/W2901609101,"Objectives To assess the safety and efficacy of percutaneous closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PmVSD) using patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occluders. Background Widespread use of conventional PmVSD closure devices has been limited by unacceptable high rate of complete heart block (CHB). The elegant design of PDA occluders is supposed to ease implantation, increase closure rate and minimize damage to adjacent structures. Thus, PDA occluders may reduce complications, especially the CHB, and offer a good alternative for PmVSD closure. Method From September 2008 to October 2015, patients who underwent attempted percutaneous VSD closure using PDA occluders were included in the study. Patient demographics, echocardiography measurements, procedure details and follow-up data until October 2017 were collected. Results In total, 321 patients with a mean age of 15.5±12.6 years and mean a weight of 33.3±20.5 kg were included in this study. The mean defect size was 4.8±2.1 mm. Implantation was successful in 307 (95.6%) patients. The median follow-up time was 63 months (24 to 108 months). The closure rates were 89.5%, 91.5%, and 99.3% after the procedure 24 hours, 6 months and 2 years, respectively. Major complications occurred in 5 (1.7%) patients during the procedure and follow-up, including persistent CHB in 2 (0.7%) patients and device embolization in 3 (1.0%) patients. No death, disability, or other major complication was detected. Conclusion Percutaneous closure of PmVSD using PDA occluders is feasible, safe and efficacious in selected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2901921948,"The sensorimotor system helps to maintain functional joint stability during movement. After anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction, several sensorimotor deficits may arise, including altered proprioception and changes in neuromuscular control. It is still unknown whether the type of autograft used in the reconstruction may influence knee sensorimotor impairments. The aim of this study was to comparatively assess the effects of the hamstring tendon (HT) and bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) ACL reconstruction techniques on knee sensorimotor control 6-12 months post-operation. A total of 83 male subjects participated in this study: 27 healthy participants, 30 BPTB-operated patients and 26 HT-operated patients. Active joint position sense in 3 ranges of motion (90-60°, 60-30°, and 30-0° of knee flexion), isometric steadiness, and onset of muscle activation were used to compare sensorimotor system function between groups. Both operated groups had a small (< 5°) but significant joint position sense error in the 30-0° range when compared to the healthy group. No significant differences were found between the operated and the control groups for isometric steadiness or onset of muscle activation. The results of this study suggest that operated patients present knee proprioceptive deficits independently of surgical technique. Nevertheless, the clinical implications of this impairment are still unknown. It seems that selected surgical approach for ACL reconstruction do not affect functioning of the sensorimotor system to a large degree."
https://openalex.org/W2949816896,"Adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are important vectors of human disease. The size of the adult female affects her success, fitness, and ability to transmit diseases. The size of the adults is determined during the aquatic larval stage. Competition among larvae for food influences the size of the pupa and thus the adult. In these experiments, the food level (mg/larva) and the density (larvae/vial) both affect intraspecific competition, which shows up as the interaction of the two factors. Furthermore, the total food per vial affects the nature of competition among the larvae, also apparent in the interaction of food and density. Male larvae are affected by the percent of males in the vial, but females are not. Seven biologically significant dependent variables were examined, and the data analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance to gain insight into the relationships among the variables and the effects of these factors on the larvae as they grew in small containers. Male and female larvae compete differently from one another for the particulate yeast cells in this experiment; female larvae outcompete males through larger size and by retaining cells within their gut at low total food levels. Under conditions of more intense competition, the pupal masses of both males and females are smaller, so the effect of competition is a reduced apparent food level. The age at pupation is also affected by food and density. Across the twenty treatment combinations of food/larva and larvae/vial, female larvae grew as though there were six different ecological environments while male larvae grew as though there were only four different environments. No interference competition was observed. Eradication efforts aimed at adult populations of this mosquito may inadvertently increase the size and robustness of the next generation of larvae, resulting in a subsequent adult population increase in the second generation."
https://openalex.org/W2901106450,"The development of gut microbiota during infancy is an important event that affects the health status of the host; however, the mechanism governing it is not fully understood, l-Amino acid oxidase 1 (LAO1) is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of particular l-amino acids and converts them into keto acids, ammonia, and H2O2. Our previous study showed that LAO1 is present in mouse milk and exerts protection against bacteria by its production of H2O2. The data led us to consider whether LAO1, H2O2, or both could impact infant gut microbiota development via mother's milk consumption in mice. Different gut microbiota profiles were observed in the wild-type (WT) and LAO1-knockout mouse pups. The WT pups' microbiota was relatively simple and composed of only a few dominant bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, whereas the lactating knockout pups had high microbiota diversity. Cross-fostering experiments indicated that WT milk (containing LAO1) has the ability to suppress the diversity of microbiota in pups. We observed that the stomach content of pups fed WT milk had LAO1 proteins and the ability to produce H2O2. Moreover, culture experiments showed that Lactobacillus was abundant in the feces of pups fed WT milk and that Lactobacillus was more resistant to H2O2 than Bifidobacterium and Escherichia. Human breast milk produces very little H2O2, which could be the reason for Lactobacillus not being dominant in the feces of breast-fed human infants. In mouse mother's milk, H2O2 is generated from the process of free amino acid metabolism, and H2O2 may be a key player in regulating the initial acquisition and development of gut microbiota, especially growth of Lactobacillus, during infancy.—Shigeno, Y., Zhang, H., Banno, T., Usuda, K., Nochi, T., Inoue, R., Watanabe, G., Jin, W., Benno, Y., Nagaoka, K.

https://openalex.org/W2901802119,"Background Due to the rise in the number of older adults within the population, healthcare demands are changing drastically, all while healthcare expenditure continues to grow. Person-centered and integrated-care models are used to support the redesigning the provision of care and support. Little is known, however, about how redesigning healthcare delivery affects the professionals involved. Objectives To explore how district nurses and social workers experience their new professional roles as case managers within Embrace, a person-centered and integrated-care service for community-living older adults. Methods We performed a qualitative study consisting of in-depth interviews with case managers (district nurses, n = 6; social workers, n = 5), using a topic-based interview guide. Audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results The experiences of the case managers involved four major themes: 1) the changing relationship with older adults, 2) establishing the case-manager role, 3) the case manager’s toolkit, and 4) the benefits of case management. Within these four themes, subthemes addressed the shift to a person-centered approach, building a relationship of trust, the process of case management, knowledge and experience, competencies of and requirements for case managers, and the differences in professional background. Discussion We found that this major change in role was experienced as a learning process, one that provided opportunities for personal and professional growth. Case managers felt that they were able to make a difference, and found their new roles satisfying and challenging, although stressful at times. Ongoing training and support were found to be a prerequisite in helping to shift the focus towards person-centered and integrated care."
https://openalex.org/W2901796600,"Knowledge of the impact of pesticides on predators is crucial for developing integrated pest management (IPM) programs. Amblyseius swirskii (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is a predatory mite used to control several species of pest including Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) and arthropods. T. urticae is a major pest of multiple greenhouse-grown and field crops including apples in Iran. Lethal and sublethal effects of fenpyroximate and thiacloprid were investigated on A. swirskii, using these chemicals separately at recommended rates or in combination at reduced rates. Recommended tested rates of both pesticides negatively influenced the biological parameters of A. swirskii such as the net reproductive rate (R0) and the intrinsic rate of increase (r). However, the combined treatment of the two pesticides at their reduced rates was less hazardous to A. swirskii. Our findings indicate that the combined use of these chemicals may be compatible with IPM programs utilizing A. swirskii as biological control tool against phytophagous mites and other pests. However, semifield and field studies to investigate the effects of reduced rate treatments of fenpyroximate and thiacloprid alone and in combination on T. urticae and A. swirskii are required for developing IPM programs."
https://openalex.org/W2901013192,"Lupus glomerulopathies are classified into various histological patterns, which probably result from different pathophysiological origins. Podocyte injury can be demonstrated in lupus nephritis but its clinical relevance is far little appreciated and is often masked by proliferative lesions and inflammatory cell infiltrations. Two patterns of podocyte lesions may be considered, either occurring in the context of renal inflammation or reflecting podocyte dysfunction in non-proliferative and non-inflammatory glomerulopathies. This distinction remains elusive since no reliable biomarker discriminates between both entities. CMIP was recently found induced in some glomerular disease but its expression in different lupus nephritis classes has not been investigated. Twenty-four adult patients with lupus nephritis, including non-proliferative (n = 11) and proliferative (n = 13) glomerulopathies were analyzed. Clinical, biological and immunological data were compared with immunomorphological findings. We analyzed by quantitative and qualitative methods the expression of CMIP in different histological classes. We found CMIP abundance selectively increased in podocytes in class II and class V glomerulopathies, while in proliferative forms (class III and class IV), CMIP was rarely detected. CMIP was not expressed in cellular crescents, endothelial cells or mesangial cells. CMIP colocalized with some subsets of B and T cells within glomerular or interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates but never with macrophages. Hematuria is rarely present in lupus glomerulopathies expressing CMIP. There was no correlation between classical immunological markers and CMIP expression. Thus, CMIP induction in lupus nephritis seems restricted to non-proliferative glomerulopathies and may define a specific pattern of podocyte injury."
https://openalex.org/W2901126393,"To quantify inequalities in zoster vaccine uptake by determining its association with socio-demographic factors: age, gender, ethnicity, immigration status, deprivation (at Lower-layer Super Output Area-level), care home residence and living arrangements.This population-based cohort study utilised anonymised primary care electronic health records from England (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) linked to deprivation and hospitalisation data. Data from 35,333 individuals from 277 general practices in England and eligible for zoster vaccination during the two-year period (2013-2015) after vaccine introduction were analysed. Logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the association of socio-demographic factors with zoster vaccine uptake for adults aged 70 years (main target group) and adults aged 79 years (catch-up group).Amongst those eligible for vaccination, 52.4% (n = 18,499) received the vaccine. Socio-demographic factors independently associated with lower zoster vaccine uptake in multivariable analyses were: being older (catch-up group: aged 79 years) aOR = 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.85-0.93), care home residence (aOR = 0.64 (95%CI: 0.57-0.73)) and living alone (aOR = 0.85 (95%CI: 0.81-0.90)). Uptake decreased with increasing levels of deprivation (p-value for trend<0.0001; aOR most deprived versus least deprived areas = 0.69 (95%CI: 0.64-0.75)). Uptake was also lower amongst those of non-White ethnicities (for example, Black versus White ethnicity: aOR = 0.61 (95%CI: 0.49-0.75)) but was not lower among immigrants after adjusting for ethnicity. Lower uptake was also seen amongst females compared to men in the catch-up group.Inequalities in zoster vaccine uptake exist in England; with lower uptake among those of non-White ethnicities, and among those living alone, in a care home and in more deprived areas. Tailored interventions to increase uptake in these social groups should assist in realising the aim of mitigating vaccination inequalities. As care home residents are also at higher risk of zoster, improving the uptake of zoster vaccination in this group will also mitigate inequalities in zoster burden."
https://openalex.org/W2901398266,"The prevalence of refractive errors, which closely relates to visual function difficulties, several ocular disorders, and decreased quality of life, varies among countries and populations. One of the highest prevalence of myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] < -0.5 diopters [D], 41.8%) has been reported in an urban city (Tajimi) in central Japan. Here, we assess refractive conditions in a rural southwestern island (Kumejima) of Japan, where a high prevalence of glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma, has been found. In Kumejima, the prevalence of myopia (SE < -0.5 D), high myopia (SE < -5 D), hyperopia (SE > +0.5 D), refractive astigmatism (cylinder > 0.5 D), and anisometropia (difference in SE between eyes > 1.0 D) were 29.5%, 1.9%, 34.1%, 38.8%, and 15.5%, respectively. Myopia decreased with age up to 70 years old but increased slightly thereafter, whereas hyperopia increased up to 70 years old and was unchanged thereafter. The prevalence of astigmatism and anisometropia was higher in older subjects. The prevalence of myopia and high myopia was higher than most of white, Hispanic, and other Asian populations, while was considerably lower than in the urban city of Japan. The high prevalence of hyperopia should be associated with high prevalence of angle closure glaucoma in this island."
https://openalex.org/W2901425078,"Purpose To determine whether glucose variability is altered during delirium days compared to non-delirious days in critically ill patients with and without diabetes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Materials and methods Critically ill patients with delirious and non-delirious days during ICU stay were included from a prospective cohort study which was conducted from January 2011- June 2013. Glucose variability was measured each observation day using various definitions (change in mean glucose, standard deviation, mean absolute glucose, daily delta and occurrence of hypo- and hyperglycemia). Mixed-effects models and generalized mixed-effects models with logit link function were performed to study the association between delirium and glucose variability, adjusting for potential confounders. Results With the exception of the risk of hypoglycemia, delirium was not linked to higher glucose variability using the various definitions of this estimate. For hypoglycemia, we did find an association with delirium in diabetic patients (OR adj.: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.71–6.32, p = 0.005), but not in non-diabetic patients (OR adj.: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.58–2.28, p = 0.689). Conclusions Despite the positive association between delirium and hypoglycemia in critically ill patients with diabetes, delirium was not associated with more pronounced glucose variability. Our findings suggest that glucose levels should be monitored more closely in diabetic patients during delirium at the ICU to prevent hypoglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2900540205,"The above and below-ground biomass (AGB and BGB) relationship is often used to assess the impact of biotic and abiotic effects on the growth and development of individual plants. The AGB and BGB relationship of the same tree species in different habitats can change significantly because of environmental stress. To investigate how the tree size, the biomass allocation and BGB/AGB ratio of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit varied according to spacing and mixed plant patterns in a valley-type savanna of southwest China, we examined the growth of L. leucocephala, and sampled 23 individuals for biomass measurement in each of four treatments (close/wide spacing of Leucaena leucocephala monocultures, mixed plantation of Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus camaldulensis, and mixed plantation of Leucaena leucocephala and Eucalyptus citriodora), and then determined the regression relationships between AGB and BGB of L. leucocephala in different plant stands. Our results indicated that mixed planting significantly reduced all growth metrics for the tree sizes of L. leucocephala and increased the value of BGB/AGB. Changing plant spacing in monocultures had a significant impact on AGB and TB (Total Biomass) of L. leucocephala, but it had no significant effect on the other metrics. Within mixed plant schemes, L. leucocephala significantly reduced the biomass allocation to leaves and small roots and increased the allocation to coarse root biomass. There were no significant differences in tree size and biomass allocation of L. leucocephala between different spacing regimes in monocultures or between different mixtures in mixed plant stands. The correlation between BGB and AGB of L. leucocephala in all plant stands was consistent with the model of allometric growth, and AGB can be used to accurately estimate BGB. Interestingly, the correlations were not exactly the same. BGB and AGB in monoculture showed isometric growth, and their values in mixed plant stands showed allometric growth. BGB also increased faster than AGB. The findings indicated that L. leucocephala allocated more biomass to the root system when it was planted with Eucalyptus."
https://openalex.org/W2900926036,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes a large pool within the global carbon cycle. Changes in land-use/cover strongly drive variation of SOC stocks. We analyzed the changes in four types of land use/cover and their influence on SOC content, density, and regional stocks along the main channel of the Tarim River in China for 2000–2010 obtained from remotely sensed images and field surveys. The areas and structures of the land uses/covers changed greatly during this period. Specifically, the areas of cultivated, industrial and residential, and shrub land increased, particularly cultivated and shrub land. The areas of forestland, grassland, water bodies, and unused land decreased. SOC stocks in forestland, grassland and unused land decreased between 2000 and 2010. The total SOC stock for the forestland shrub land grassland and unused land was lower in 2010 than 2000. Land-use/cover conversion thus affected SOC stocks. Specifically, conversions from forestland to shrub land, forestland to grassland, forestland to unused land, grassland to shrub land, grassland to unused land, and shrub land to unused land decreased the SOC stocks. This study provides a scientific basis for eco-environmental protection in arid areas."
https://openalex.org/W2901613090,"The valley of the Magdalena River is one of the main population pathways in Colombia. The gene pool and spatial configuration of human groups in this territory have been outlined throughout three historical stages: the Native pre-Hispanic world, Spanish colonization, and XIX century migrations. This research was designed with the goal of characterizing the diversity and distribution pattern of Y-chromosome lineages that are currently present in the Tolima and Huila departments (middle Magdalena River region). Historic cartography was used to identify the main geographic sites where the paternal lineages belonging to this area have gathered. Twelve municipalities were chosen, and a survey that included genealogical information was administered. Samples collected from 83 male volunteers were analyzed for 48 Y-SNPs and 17 Y-STRs. The results showed a highly diverse region characterized by the presence of 16 sublineages within the major clades R, Q, J, G, T and E and revealed that 93% (n = 77) of haplotypes were different. Among these haplogroups, European-specific R1b-M269 lineages were the most representative (57.83%), with six different subhaplogroups and 43 unique haplotypes. Native American paternal ancestry was also detected based on the presence of the Q1a2-M3*(xM19, M194, M199) and Q1a2-M346*(xM3) lineages. Interestingly, all Q1a2-M346*(xM3) samples (n = 7, with five different haplotypes) carried allele six at the DYS391 locus. This allele has a worldwide frequency of 0.169% and was recently associated with a new Native subhaplogroup. An in-depth phylogenetic analysis of these samples suggests the Tolima and Huila region to be the principal area in all Central and South America where this particular Native lineage is found. This lineage has been present in the region for at least 1,809 (+/- 0,5345) years."
https://openalex.org/W2901006833,"Prevalence of depression is higher in patients with cancer than in the general population. Sustained systemic inflammation has been associated with depressive behavior and it has been reported that depressed patients commonly display alterations in their immune system. We previously showed that cancer in mice induces a systemic environment that promotes neutrophil activation and leukocytosis. We thus hypothesized that the peripheral systemic response to a solid tumor leads to endothelial activation, which may promote inflammatory changes in the brain with behavioral consequences. Using the Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model, we show that tumor growth induces a progressive increase in peripheral inflammation as observed by elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6). In behavioral studies, tumor-bearing mice showed no sign of motor, coordination or short term working memory deficits as assessed by rotarod, balance-beam, and novel object recognition tests. However, there was an impairment in the grip strength test and interestingly, an anxious and despair-like phenotype in the elevated plus-maze, and tail suspension tests, respectively. Immunostaining of perfused brains revealed fibrin accumulation in the vasculature with some leakage into the parenchyma, a process known to activate endothelial cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the inflamed and prothrombotic systemic environment created by the growth of a peripherally-located solid tumor induces endothelial activation, accumulation of fibrin in the brain and astrocyte activation, perhaps leading to depressive-like behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2901143122,"Epidemiological studies have suggested that coffee consumption is negatively correlated with the incidence of Parkinson’s disease. Coffee contains relatively high levels of β-carbolines, which have been ascribed neuroactive effects in humans however the positive or negative effect has not been confirmed yet. Two ingredients with applications as coffee substitutes—chicory, which is traditionally used in this way, and artichoke—were considered in this study both from the neuroactive point of view but also in relation to the other bioactive compounds that result from their thermal processing. These thermal products are of concern because of their possible toxic properties. The estimated concentration of β-carbolines was high in both materials (1.8 μg/g and 2.5 μg/g harman and 2.9 μg/g and 3.1 μg/g norharman in chicory and artichoke, respectively). Artichoke had more β-carbolines than chicory, and also more all the toxic compounds examined here–acrylamide, carboxymethyllysine, and furans, which were detected in significantly higher concentrations in artichoke, particularly acrylamide. Chicory and artichoke also contain phenolic compounds that possess high antioxidant activity, on a similar level. Artichoke, a new proposed ingredient in coffee substitutes, appears to be a richer source of β-carbolines than the traditionally chicory. Both materials contained high level of undesirable components, such as furan and its derivatives, carboxymethyllysine and particularly acrylamide, much higher in artichoke."

Methods Medical charts of adults with TSC-associated rAML followed at a specialty medical center in the Netherlands (1990–2015). Included patients treated with everolimus (n = 33, of which 27 were included in the kidney size analyses and 27 in the kidney function analyses [21 patients in both]; index date = everolimus initiation) and non-treated patients (n = 39, of which 29 were included in the kidney size analyses and 33 in the kidney function analyses [23 patients in both]; index date = one date among all dates with outcome measurement).Percent change in kidney size and kidney function from the index date to the best measurement in the two years post-index date (best response) compared between patients treated and not treated with everolimus. Results Compared with non-treated patients, significantly more everolimus-treated patients experienced a reduction in the size of their largest kidney in the two years post-index date (85.2% vs. 37.9%, p < 0.01). Also, there was a tendency towards more improvement in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among the everolimus-treated patients (55.6% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.08). Conclusions The study results suggest that everolimus is effective in controlling and even reversing the growth of the kidneys, used as a proxy for rAML size, as well as preserving or improving kidney function in patients with TSC and rAML treated in a real-world, observational setting."
https://openalex.org/W2900469846,"Profiling T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire via short read transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has a unique advantage of probing simultaneously TCRs and the genome-wide RNA expression of other genes. However, compared to targeted amplicon approaches, the shorter read length is more prone to mapping error. In addition, only a small percentage of the genome-wide reads may cover the TCR loci and thus the repertoire could be significantly under-sampled. Although this approach has been applied in a few studies, the utility of transcriptome sequencing in probing TCR repertoires has not been evaluated extensively. Here we present a systematic assessment of RNA-Seq in TCR profiling. We evaluate the power of both Fluidigm C1 full-length single cell RNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq in characterizing the repertoires of different diversities under either naïve conditions or after immunogenic challenges. Standard read length and sequencing coverage were employed so that the evaluation was conducted in accord with the current RNA-Seq practices. Despite high sequencing depth in bulk RNA-Seq, we encountered difficulty quantifying TCRs with low transcript abundance (<1%). Nevertheless, top enriched TCRs with an abundance of 1–3% or higher can be faithfully detected and quantified. When top TCR sequences are of interest and transcriptome sequencing is available, it is worthwhile to conduct a TCR profiling using the RNA-Seq data."
https://openalex.org/W2900893310,"Stroke evolution is a highly dynamic but variable disease which makes clinical decision making difficult. Biomarker discovery programs intended to aid clinical decision making have however largely ignored the rapidity of stroke evolution. We have used gene array technology to determine blood mRNA expression changes over the first day after stroke in rats. Blood samples were collected from 8 male spontaneously hypertensive rats at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 24h post stroke induction by middle cerebral artery occlusion. RNA was extracted from whole blood stabilized in PAXgene tubes and mRNA expression was detected by oligonucleotide Affymetrix microarray. Using a pairwise comparison model, 1932 genes were identified to vary significantly over time (p≤0.5x10-7) within 24h after stroke. Some of the top20 most changed genes are already known to be relevant to the ischemic stroke physiopathology (e.g. Il-1R, Nos2, Prok2). Cluster analysis showed multiple stereotyped and time dependent profiles of gene expression. Direction and rate of change of expression for some profiles varied dramatically during these 24h. Profiles with potential clinical utility including hyper acute or acute transient upregulation (with expression peaking from 2 to 6h after stroke and normalisation by 24h) were identified. We found that blood gene expression varies rapidly and stereotypically after stroke in rats. Previous researchers have often missed the optimum time for biomarker measurement. Temporally overlapping profiles have the potential to provide a biological “stroke clock” able to tell the clinician how far an individual stroke has evolved."
https://openalex.org/W2901434606,"Background Low volume resuscitation (LVR) in shock prevents deleterious effects of crystalloid loading in pre-hospital settings. Polyethylene glycol 20,000 (PEG-20k) based LVR solutions are 20-fold more effective at maintaining perfusion and survival in shock compared to conventional crystalloids. The aim of this study was to determine coagulation and platelet function of whole blood treated with 10% PEG-20k. Methods Citrated blood from volunteers (n = 25) or early admission severely injured trauma patients (n = 9) were diluted 10% with various LVR solutions in a matched design with a paired volume control (saline), and studied using thromboelastography (TEG). Findings In healthy volunteers and patients, 10% PEG-20k significantly increased clot amplification time (k), decreased propagation (angle), maximal clot size and strength (MA), and the overall coagulation index (CI), but not clot initiation (R) or fibrinolysis (Ly30), relative to paired saline dilutional controls. Clinically, K, angle, and MA were just outside of the normal limits in volunteers but not in patients. No statistical differences existed between PEG-20k and Hextend (HES) in either patient population. In a dose response series using volunteer blood, all effects of 10% PEG-20k on TEG were reversed and normalized by lower concentrations (7.5% and 5%). Furthermore, 7.5% PEG-20k produced similar resuscitation effects as 10% PEG in rodent hemorrhagic shock models (n = 5). Conclusions In conclusion, PEG-20k based LVR solutions produced a dose-dependent minor hypocoagulative state, possibly associated with changes in clot propagation and platelet function, which can be reversed by dose reduction in concentration while providing superior LVR, microvascular rescue, and lactate clearance compared to saline or starch."

We investigated the SL biomarker potential regarding virologic endpoints in a prospective subgroup of patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection.From 2009-2016 98 patients with HBeAg-negative HBV infection were prospectively followed over four years. Clinical, laboratory and imaging data were evaluated annually. SLs were assessed in available serum probes via liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry.Of those 98 patients, 10 (10.2%) showed HBV reactivation, 13 (13.2%) lost HBsAg and 9 (9.1%) gained status of HBsAg-/HBsAb-coexistence, whereas 66 (67.3%) had no events. Within the four-year analysis sphingosine (p = 0.020), sphinganine (p<0.001), dhS1P (p<0.001), C16DHC (p<0.01) and C20Cer (p<0.001) showed a significant upregulation in patients without virologic events, C18Cer significantly decreased (p<0.001). At baseline decreased S1P-, dhS1P- and C16Cer-levels were observed in patients with upcoming status of HBsAg-/HBsAb-coexistence.

https://openalex.org/W2901013164,"This study investigated how attending to auditory and visual information systematically changes graph theoretical measures of integration and functional connectivity between three network modules: auditory, visual, and a joint task core. Functional MRI BOLD activity was recorded while healthy volunteers attended to colour and/or pitch information presented within an audiovisual stimulus sequence. Network nodes and modules were based on peak voxels of BOLD contrasts, including colour and pitch sensitive brain regions as well as the dorsal attention network. Network edges represented correlations between nodes’ activity and were computed separately for each condition. Connection strength was increased between the task and the visual module when participants attended to colour, and between the task and the auditory module when they attended to pitch. Moreover, several nodal graph measures showed consistent changes to attentional modulation in form of stronger integration of sensory regions in response to attention. Together, these findings corroborate dynamical adjustments of both modality-specific and modality-independent functional brain networks in response to task demands and their representation in graph theoretical measures."

In this study, we have reported the main characteristics of influenza B virus in Mongolia, including prevalence, lineages, suitability with vaccine strains and drug susceptibility against the virus. 15768 specimens were tested by qPCR for detecting influenza viruses. From positive specimens for influenza B virus, the clinical isolates were isolated using MDCK cells. Sequencing analysis, hemagglutination inhibition assay and Neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) drug susceptibility testing were performed for the clinical isolates. Influenza B virus was around in 3.46% of the samples in Mongolia, and B/Victoria clade-1A and B/Yamagata clade-3 lineages were predominant. Importantly, it was confirmed that the lineages corresponded to the vaccine strains. Moreover, drug susceptibility tests revealed that some Mongolian clinical isolates showed reduced susceptibility to antiviral agents. Interestingly, G104R was identified as a novel mutation, which might have a significant role in drug resistance of the virus. These results describe the characteristics of influenza B viruses that have caused respiratory illness in the population of Mongolia between 2013 and 2017."
https://openalex.org/W2901645466,"Although genes on the human X chromosome reportedly influence tooth crown morphology, little is known about X chromosome activation or inactivation systems relevant to morphological variations. We assessed the relationships between tooth crown size and crown morphological traits in females with Turner syndrome, the variants of which include complete absence of one X chromosome, lack of the short arm (Xp), or duplication of the long arms (Xq), and then estimated the functions of Xp and Xq in the process of unilateral X chromosome inactivation during tooth crown development. The mesiodistal and buccolingual diameters in the maxillary first (M1) and second (M2) permanent molars were compared among X chromosome karyotypes by multiple regression analyses, and their relationships with the development of Carabelli’s cusp and the distolingual cusp were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The crown sizes increased in the order of the 46,X,i(Xq) karyotype, 45,X and 45,X/46,XX karyotypes, and control group. A lower frequency of Carabelli’s cusp and higher frequency of a reduced distolingual cusp in M1 were characteristics of Turner syndrome. The overall M1 and M2 crown sizes differed among the X chromosome karyotypes, whereas a smaller crown size was associated with a reduced distolingual cusp but not with Carabelli’s cusp. Considering the differences in chromosome arrangement among females with Turner syndrome and the process of unilateral X chromosome inactivation, the observed results can be considered in terms of quantity or number of promoters/inhibitors during tooth crown development. The X chromosome karyotypes have a strong influence on the overall crown sizes of the M1 and M2 molars because those karyotypes with variable numbers of active gene regions directly influence tooth germ development in an early stage of human odontogenesis. The later forming cusps, such as the distolingual cusp and Carabelli’s cusp, may be affected by this developmental prerequisite."

The species in the order Beloniformes have commercial importance in recreational fisheries. In order to further clarify the phylogenetic relationship of these important species, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of garfish Hyporhamphus quoyi of Hemiramphidae within Beloniformes. The mitogenome was 16,524 bp long and was typical of other teleosts mitogenomes in size and content. Thirteen PCGs started with the typical ATG codon (with exception of the cytochrome coxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene with GTG). All tRNA sequences could be folded into expected cloverleaf secondary structures except for tRNASer (AGN) which lost a dihydrouracil (DHU) stem. The control region was 866 bp in length, which contained some conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) common to Beloniformes. The phylogenetic relationship between 26 fish Beloniformes species was analyzed based on the complete nucleotide and amino acid sequences of 13 PCGs by two different inference methods (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference). Phylogenetic analyses revealed Hemiramphidae as the sister group to Exocoetidae and it is a paraphyletic grouping.

https://openalex.org/W2900552280,"Environmental heterogeneity can foster opportunistic foraging by mobile species, resulting in generalized resource and habitat use. Determining species’ food web roles is important to fully understand how ecosystems function, and stable isotopes can provide insight into the foraging ecology of bird assemblages. We investigated flexibility of food choice in mangrove bird assemblages of northeast Australia by determining whether species’ carbon and nitrogen isotopic values corresponded to foraging group classification described in the literature, such as groups of species that are omnivorous or insectivorous. Subsequently, we evaluated foraging group isotopic niche size, overlap, degree of individual specialisation, and the probable proportions of coastal resources that contribute to their collective diets. We found that mangrove birds are more opportunistic when foraging than expected from previous diet studies. Importantly, relationships between the dietary diversity of species within a foraging group and isotopic niche size are spatially inconsistent, making inferences regarding foraging strategies difficult. However, quantifying individual specialisation and determining the probable relative contributions of coastal resources to the collective diet of isotope-based foraging groups can help to differentiate between specialised and generalised foraging strategies. We suggest that flexibility in mangrove bird foraging strategy occurs in response to environmental heterogeneity. A complementary approach that combines isotopic analysis with other dietary information (collated from previous diet studies using visual observation or gut content analyses) has provided useful insight to how bird assemblages partition resources in spatiotemporally heterogeneous environments."
https://openalex.org/W2901093244,"Micro-simulation models of risk-factors and chronic diseases are built increasingly often, and each model starts with an initial population. Constructing such populations when no survey data covering all variables are available is no trivial task, often requiring complex methods based on several (untested) assumptions. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the merits of construction methods, and apply this to one specific method: the construction method used in the DYNAMO-HIA model.The initial population constructed using the DYNAMO-HIA method is compared to another population constructed by starting a simulation with only newborns and simulating the course taken by one risk-factor and several diseases. In this simulation, the age- and sex-specific prevalence of the risk-factor is kept constant over time.Our simulations show that, in general, the DYNAMO-HIA method clearly outperforms a method that assumes independence of the risk-factor and the prevalence of diseases and independence between all diseases. In many situations the DYNAMO-HIA method performs reasonably well, but in some the proportion with the risk-factor for those with a disease is under- or overestimated by as much as 10 percentage points. For determining comorbidity between diseases linked by a common causal disease or a common risk-factor it also performs reasonably well. However, the current method performs poorly for determining the comorbidity between one disease caused by the other.The DYNAMO-HIA methods perform reasonably well; they outperform a baseline assumption of independence between the risk-factor and diseases in the initial population. The method for determining the comorbidity between diseases that are causally linked needs improvement. Given the existing discrepancies for situations with high relative risks, however, developing more elaborate methods based on running simulation models to generate an initial population would be worthwhile."
https://openalex.org/W2901589611,"In order to retrieve similar trademarks from large-scale trademark databases, combining the characteristics of trademark images, this paper presents a trademark image retrieval method based on regional and border feature fusion. Based on the target image extraction, the proposed approach describes the target region and border features. The region feature description is mainly based on the concept of partition block statistics. The region is divided into equal-area unit using concentric circles, and feature extraction is performed in each small block unit. For the border feature description, this study first detect corners, and then construct a Delaunay graph and extract features by combining the corner detected and the Delaunay triangulation reconstruction. In the search process, the method also incorporates information such as the trademark's color characteristics, trademark classification, and trademark keywords. The present study carried out image retrieval experiment on CE-SHAPE-1 database containing 1400 MPEG-7 core experimental shape, a classification trademark database containing 2000 images, and a national trademark database containing approximately 4.89 million images. The experimental results show that the proposed approach combines the advantages of region and border feature description, and can choose the best among various local optimizations, which makes the retrieval result more effective, more in line with human visual perception, and improves the retrieval accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2901796102,"The α-zein gene family encodes the most abundant storage proteins of maize (Zea mays) endosperm. Members of this family are expressed in a parent-of-origin manner. To characterize this phenomenon further, we investigated the expression of a subset of α-zein polypeptides in reciprocal crosses between o2 lines that were characterized by a simplified α-zein pattern. Maize lines that suppressed the expression of α-zeins when used as female parents were identified. The suppression was cross-specific, occurring only when specific genetic backgrounds were combined. Four α-zein sequences that were sensitive to uniparental expression were isolated. Molecular characterization of these α-zeins confirmed that their expression or suppression depended on the genetic proprieties of the endosperm tissue instead of their parental origin. DNA methylation analysis of both maternally and paternally expressed α-zeins revealed no clear correlation between this epigenetic marker and parent-of-origin allelic expression, suggesting that an additional factor(s) is involved in this process. Genetic analyses revealed that the ability of certain lines to suppress α-zein expression was unstable after one round of heterozygosity with non-suppressing lines. Interestingly, α-zeins also showed a transgressive expression pattern because unexpressed isoforms were reactivated in both F2 and backcross plants. Collectively, our results suggest that parent-of-origin expression of specific α-zein alleles depends on a complex interaction between genotypes in a manner that is reminiscent of paramutation-like phenomena."

The present study focused on the IPB, based on the Interpersonal Problem Circumplex (IPC), in persons with low back pain and its association with pain, psychological characteristics, and health care utilisation. Methods In a cross-sectional design, individuals with back pain (N = 88) and healthy control persons who matched by age, gender, and educational level (N = 88) were compared with regard to IPB. Furthermore, back pain patients classified by their IPB (N = 24 low, N = 48 moderate, N = 16 high) were compared regarding pain, depression, catastrophising, and health care utilisation. Results In comparison to the healthy reference sample, a significant difference in the interpersonal problems of the low back pain group, with a tendency towards being overly ‘introverted’, ‘exploitable’, and ‘subassertive’, was revealed. In the back pain group, participants with elevated IPB showed significantly higher levels of pain intensity, functional disability, depression, catastrophising, and health care utilisation than participants with IPB in the normal range. Conclusion Application of the Interpersonal Circumplex Model can help to characterize a subgroup of persons with low back pain. Increased general interpersonal problems are associated with elevated burden in pain-related, psychological, and health care-related variables. Future research should focus on the treatment opportunities for this subgroup, as well as on the influence of interpersonal problems during the course of back pain."

Between January 2016 and June 2016, 229 patients underwent preoperative neck CT and subsequent thyroid surgery at five participating institutions. The neck CT images of each patient were retrospectively reviewed and classified into the following four categories: no DTD, indeterminate, suspicious for DTD, and DTD. The results of the CT image evaluations were compared with the histopathological results to determine the diagnostic accuracy of CT at each institution. According to the histopathological results, there were NTP (n = 151), Hashimoto thyroiditis (n = 24), non-Hashimoto lymphocytic thyroiditis (n = 47), and diffuse hyperplasia (n = 7). The CT categories of the 229 patients were ""no DTD"" in 89 patients, ""indeterminate"" in 40 patients, ""suspicious for DTD"" in 42 patients, and ""DTD"" in 58 patients. The presence of two or more CT features of DTD, which was classified as ""suspicious for DTD"" by all radiologists, had the largest area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (Az = 0.820; 95% confidence interval: 0.764, 0.868), with sensitivity of 85.9% and specificity of 78.2%. However, no statistical significance between readers' experience and their diagnostic accuracy was found. In conclusion, evaluations of CT images are helpful for differentiating DTD from NTP."

The self-reported information on risk factors was obtained using standard protocols of the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance. The outcome of interest was self-reported diabetes on medication. Adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factor of diabetes.A total of 31,066 participants aged 18 years and older were included for the analysis. The prevalence of self-reported hypertension was 1.8% (491). Risk factors for diabetes were: age groups: 35-44 years adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.82 (95% CI, 1.07, 7.41), 45-54 years AOR = 6.02 (95% CI, 2.29, 15.83), 55-64 year AOR = 15.7 (95% CI 5.93, 41.55) and >65 years AOR = 19.60 (95% CI, 6.93, 55.71); high school and diploma/certificate education AOR = 2.57, (95% CI 1.62, 4.07) and AOR = 3.92 (95% CI 1.70, 9.07); and urban dwellers AOR = 2.37, (95% 1.58, 3.57); hypertension AOR = 3.3, (95% CI 2.47, 4.41); and fruit servings of 1-3 per week AOR = 1.63 (95% CI 1.15, 2.31).The number of Bhutanese adults with diabetes and co-morbidities associated with it is likely to increase with the ageing of the population, nutrition transition, and high rural-urban migration in the near future. This calls for an urgent need to implement strategies to prevent diabetes in the Bhutanese population targeting risk factors including healthy lifestyle with increased physical activities and reduced smoking. At the same time treating other chronic morbidities including hypertension."

In 2015, women held 39.6% of parliamentary seats in Mozambique, which is above the benchmark of 30% that has been suggested as the turning point for minority representation to move from token status to having a sizable impact. We undertook a study to identify gender-related barriers and facilitators to improving women-centered policies in the health sector. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with 39 individuals (32 women, 7 men) involved at a senior level in policy making or implementation of woman-centric policies within the Mozambique Ministry of Health and affiliated institutions. We used a semi-structured interview guide that included questions on difficulties and facilitating factors encountered in the policy making process, and the perceived role of gender in this process. We used both deductive and inductive analysis approaches, starting with a set of pre-identified themes and expanding this to include themes that emerged during coding. Results Our data suggest two main findings: (1) the women who participated in our study generally do not report feeling discrimination in the workplace and (2) senior health sector perceive women to be more personally attuned to women-centric issues than men. Within our specific sample, we found little to suggest that gender discrimination is a problem professionally for female decision-makers in Mozambique. However, these findings should be contextualized using an intersectional lens with recognition of the important difference between descriptive versus substantive female representation, and whether “percentage of women” is truly the best metric for gaging commitment to gender equality at the policy making level. Conclusions Mozambique’s longstanding significant representation of women may have led to creating an environment that leads to positive experiences for female decision-makers in the government. However, while the current level of female representation should be celebrated, it does not negate the need for continued focus on female representation in decision-making positions."
https://openalex.org/W2901032465,"We analyzed and compared the decision-making processes underlying two approaches that academics might use to decide whether to pursue a professorship or an alternative career: academic coaching (a paid service that supports academics with career-related issues) and decision analysis (a method for applying decision theory to real-world decision problems). To this end, we conducted in-depth expert interviews with seven out of 11 academic coaches known to work in Berlin to examine empirically the career decision-making process that they use. Moreover, we demonstrate theoretically how decision analysis can be applied to an academic’s hypothetical career choice problem. A comparison of the two approaches showed that they both advise (i) structuring the decision problem by dividing it into smaller components, (ii) using the academic’s objectives to generate career alternatives, and (iii) quantifying the uncertainty of decision outcomes using subjective probabilities. Moreover, the observed differences in the way the two approaches structure the decision problem suggest ways in which they could inform each other: (i) they could make use of each other’s techniques to help academics define their objectives and generate career alternatives; (ii) academic coaching could, in addition, use decision trees (a hallmark of decision analysis) to represent the structure of the career decision problem, and use simple measurement scales to quantify how much the career options contribute to the academic’s objectives."
