We retrospectively evaluated treatment outcomes, including change in quality of life scores (St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (QoL)), weight and Aspergillus IgG at 6 and 12 months following initiation of therapy in a cohort of 206 CPA patients referred to the UK National Aspergillosis Centre (NAC), Manchester between April 2013 and March 2015. One hundred and forty-two patients (69%) were azole naïve at presentation and 105 (74%) (Group A) were commenced on itraconazole, 27 (19%) on voriconazole, and 10 (7%) were not treated medically. The remainder (64 patients, 31%) had previously trialled, or remained on, azole therapy at inclusion (Group B) of whom 46 (72%) received itraconazole, 16 (25%) voriconazole, and 2 (3%) posaconazole. Initial therapy was continued for 12 months in 78 patients (48%) of those treated; the azole was changed in 62 (32%) patients and discontinued in 56 (29%) patients for adverse reactions (32, 57%), azole resistance (11, 20%), clinical failure (8, 14%) or clinical stability (5, 9%). Azole discontinuation rates were higher in Group B than in Group A (42% vs. 22%, p = 0.003). For all patients who survived, weight increased (median of 62.2Kg at baseline, to 64.8 at 12 months), mean Aspergillus IgG declined from 260 (baseline) to 154 (12 months) and QoL improved from 62.2/100 (baseline) to 57.2/100 (12 months). At 12 months, there was no difference in median survival between Groups A and B (95% vs. 91%, p = 0.173). The rate of emergence of resistance during therapy was 13% for itraconazole compared to 5% for voriconazole. Bronchial artery embolization was done in 9 (4.4%) patients and lobectomy in 7 (3.2%). The optimal duration of azole therapy in CPA is undetermined due to the absence of evidenced based endpoints allowing clinical trials to be undertaken. However we have demonstrated itraconazole and voriconazole are modestly effective for CPA, especially if given for 12 months, but fewer than 50% of patients manage this duration. This suggests extended therapy may be required for demonstrable clinical improvement."

https://openalex.org/W2797761902,"Identifying essential proteins is very important for understanding the minimal requirements of cellular life and finding human disease genes as well as potential drug targets. Experimental methods for identifying essential proteins are often costly, time-consuming, and laborious. Many computational methods for such task have been proposed based on the topological properties of protein-protein interaction networks (PINs). However, most of these methods have limited prediction accuracy due to the noisy and incomplete natures of PINs and the fact that protein essentiality may relate to multiple biological factors. In this work, we proposed a new centrality measure, OGN, by integrating orthologous information, gene expressions, and PINs together. OGN determines a protein’s essentiality by capturing its co-clustering and co-expression properties, as well as its conservation in the evolution process. The performance of OGN was tested on the species of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Compared with several published centrality measures, OGN achieves higher prediction accuracy in both working alone and ensemble."
https://openalex.org/W2797955269,"Background Small glomerular IgA deposits have been reported in patients with liver cirrhosis, mainly as an incidental finding in autopsy studies. We recently encountered nine cirrhotic patients who presented with acute proliferative glomerulonephritis with unusually large, exuberant glomerular immune complex deposits, in the absence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or monoclonal gammopathy-related kidney disease. Deposits were typically IgA dominant/codominant. Our aim was to further elucidate the etiology, diagnostic pitfalls, and clinical outcomes. Methods We present clinical features and kidney biopsy findings of nine cirrhotic patients with an unusual acute immune complex glomerulonephritis. We also identified native kidney biopsies from all patients with liver cirrhosis at our institution over a 13-year period (January 2004 to December 2016) to evaluate presence of glomerular IgA deposits in them (n = 118). Results Six of nine cirrhotic patients with the large immune deposits had a recent/concurrent acute bacterial infection, prompting a diagnosis of infection-associated glomerulonephritis and treatment with antibiotics. In the remaining three patients, no infection was identified and corticosteroids were initiated. Three of nine patients recovered kidney function (one recovered kidney function after liver transplant); three patients developed chronic kidney disease but remained off dialysis; two patients became dialysis-dependent and one patient developed sepsis and expired shortly after biopsy. Within the total cohort of 118 patients with cirrhosis, 67 others also showed IgA deposits, albeit small; and 42 patients had no IgA deposits. Conclusions These cases provide support to the theory that liver dysfunction may compromise clearance of circulating immune complexes, enabling deposition in the kidney. At least in a subset of cirrhotic patients, a superimposed bacterial infection may serve as a “second-hit” and lead to acute glomerulonephritis with exuberant immune complex deposits. Therefore, a trial of antibiotics is recommended and caution is advised before immunosuppressive treatment is offered. Unfortunately, most of these patients have advanced liver failure; therefore both diagnosis and management remain a challenge."

https://openalex.org/W2797924787,"Spawning ground of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC."
https://openalex.org/W2797987112,"Fibulin-7 (Fbln7) has been identified as the latest member of the fibulin family of secreted glycoproteins in developing teeth, functioning as a cell adhesion molecule and interacting with other matrix proteins, receptors, and growth factors. More recently, we have shown that the C-terminal Fbln7 fragment (Fbln7-C) has antiangiogenic activity in vitro. Fbln7 is also expressed in immune-privileged tissues, such as eye and placenta, but its functional significance is unknown. In the current study, we show that human monocytes adhere to both full-length Fbln7 (Fbln7-FL) and Fbln7-C, in part, via integrins α5β1 and α2β1. Morphologic studies and surface expression analyses of CD14, mannose receptor (CD206), major histocompatibility complex II, and CD11b receptors revealed that both Fbln7-FL and Fbln7-C inhibit M-CSF-induced monocyte differentiation. Fbln7-C had significantly greater negative effects on cell spreading and stress fiber formation, including the production of IL-6 and metalloproteinase-1/-9 compared with Fbln7-FL. Furthermore, in an LPS-induced systemic inflammation model, Fbln7-C and Fbln7-FL reduced the infiltration of immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, to the inflamed peritoneum. Thus, these results suggest that Fbln7 and Fbln7-C could modulate the activity of immune cells and have therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases.-Sarangi, P. P., Chakraborty, P., Dash, S. P., Ikeuchi, T., de Vega, S., Ambatipudi, K., Wahl, L., Yamada, Y. Cell adhesion protein fibulin-7 and its C-terminal fragment negatively regulate monocyte and macrophage migration and functions in vitro and in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2799299295,"Recent research suggests that psychological needs can influence the political attitudes of ordinary citizens, often outside of their conscious awareness. In this paper, we investigate whether psychological needs also shape the spending priorities of political elites in the US. Most models of policymaking assume that political elites respond to information in relatively homogeneous ways. We suggest otherwise, and explore one source of difference in information processing, namely, threat sensitivity, which previous research links to increased support for conservative policy attitudes. Drawing on a sample of state-level policymakers, we measure their spending priorities using a survey and their level of threat sensitivity using a standard psychophysiological measure (skin conductance). We find that, like ordinary citizens, threat sensitivity leads even state-level policymakers to prioritize spending on government polices that are designed to minimize threats."
https://openalex.org/W2798219162,"Management of forest for wood production has altered ecosystem structures and processes and led to habitat loss and species extinctions, worldwide. Deadwood is a key resource supporting forest biodiversity, and commonly declines following forest management. However, different forest management methods affect dead wood differently. For example, uneven-aged silviculture maintains an age-stratified forest with ongoing dead wood production, while even-aged silviculture breaks forest continuity, leading to long periods without large trees. We asked how deadwood-dependent beetles respond to different silvicultural practices and if their responses depend on deadwood volume, and beetles preference for decay stages of deadwood. We compared beetle assemblages in five boreal forest types with different management strategies: clearcutting and thinning (both representing even-aged silviculture), selective felling (representing uneven-aged silviculture), reference and old growth forest (both uneven-aged controls without a recent history [~50 years] of management, but the latter with high conservation values). We collected beetles using window traps and by sieving the bark from experimental logs (bolts). Beetle assemblages on clear-cuts differed from all other stand types, regardless of trapping method or decay stage preference. Thinning differed from reference stands, indicating incomplete recovery after clear-cutting, while selective felling differed only from clear-cuts. In contrast to our predictions, early and late successional species responded similarly to different silvicultural practices. However, there were indications of marginal assemblage differences both between thinned stands and selective felling and between thinned and old growth stands (p = 0.10). The stand volume of early decay stage wood influenced assemblage composition of early, but not late successional species. Uneven-aged silviculture maintained species assemblages similar to those of the reference and old growth stands and might therefore be a better management option when considering biodiversity conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2797990875,"SHetA2 is a small molecule drug with promising cancer prevention and therapeutic activity and a high preclinical safety profile. The study objectives were to perform interspecies scaling and pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling of SHetA2 for human PK prediction. The PK data obtained from mice, rats, and dogs after intravenous and oral doses were used for simultaneous fitting to PK models. The disposition of SHetA2 was best described by a two-compartment model. The absorption kinetics was well characterized with a first-order absorption model for mice and rats, and a gastrointestinal transit model for dogs. Oral administration of SHetA2 showed a relatively fast absorption in mice, prolonged absorption (i.e., flip-flop kinetics) toward high doses in rats, and an early peak followed by a secondary peak at high doses in dogs. The oral bioavailability was 17.7–19.5% at 20–60 mg/kg doses in mice, <1.6% at 100–2000 mg/kg in rats, and 11.2% at 100 mg/kg decreasing to 3.45% at 400 mg/kg and 1.11% at 1500 mg/kg in dogs. The disposition parameters were well correlated with the body weight for all species using the allometric equation, which predicted values of CL (17.3 L/h), V1 (36.2 L), V2 (68.5 L) and CLD (15.2 L/h) for a 70-kg human. The oral absorption rate and bioavailability of SHetA2 was highly dependent on species, doses, formulations, and possibly other factors. The limited bioavailability at high doses was taken into consideration for the suggested first-in-human dose, which was much lower than the dose estimated based on toxicology studies. In summary, the present study provided the PK model for SHetA2 that depicted the disposition and absorption kinetics in preclinical species, and computational tools for human PK prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2796892535,"In this study, we identify the means by which segmentally homologous neurons acquire different neuropeptide fates in Drosophila. Ventral abdominal (Va)-neurons in the A1 segment of the ventral nerve cord express DH31 and AstA neuropeptides (neuropeptidergic fate I) by virtue of Ubx activity, whereas the A2-A4 Va-neurons express the Capa neuropeptide (neuropeptidergic fate II) under the influence of abdA. These different fates are attained through segment-specific programs of neural subtype specification undergone by segmentally homologous neurons. This is an attractive alternative by which Hox genes can shape Drosophila segmental neural architecture (more sophisticated than the previously identified binary “to live” or “not to live” mechanism). These data refine our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2803060539,"Polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (P-SHG) microscopy has evolved as a promising technique to reveal subresolution information about the structure and orientation of ordered biological macromolecules. To extend the adoption of the technique, it should be easily integrated onto commercial laser scanning microscopes. Furthermore, procedures for easy calibration and assessment of measurement accuracy are essential, and measurements should be fully automated to allow for analysis of large quantities of samples. In this paper we present a setup for P-SHG which is readily incorporated on commercial multiphoton microscopes. The entire system is completely automated which allows for rapid calibration through the freely available software and for automated imaging for different polarization measurements, including linear and circular polarization of the excitation beam. The results show that calibration settings are highly system dependent. We also show that the accuracy of the polarization control is easily quantified and that it varies between systems. The accuracy can be tuned by iterative alignment of optics or a more fine-grained calibration procedure. Images of real samples show that the red accuracy of the results is easily visualized with the automated setup. Through this system we believe that P-SHG could develop a wider adoption in biomedical applications."

https://openalex.org/W2798050887,"In political campaigns, perceived candidate credibility influences the persuasiveness of messages. In campaigns aiming to influence people’s beliefs, micro-targeted campaigns (MTCs) that target specific voters using their psychological profile have become increasingly prevalent. It remains open how effective MTCs are, notably in comparison to population-targeted campaign strategies. Using an agent-based model, the paper applies recent insights from cognitive models of persuasion, extending them to the societal level in a novel framework for exploring political campaigning. The paper provides an initial treatment of the complex dynamics of population level political campaigning in a psychologically informed manner. Model simulations show that MTCs can take advantage of the psychology of the electorate by targeting voters favourable disposed towards the candidate. Relative to broad campaigning, MTCs allow for efficient and adaptive management of complex campaigns. Findings show that disliked MTC candidates can beat liked population-targeting candidates, pointing to societal questions concerning campaign regulations."
https://openalex.org/W2796881510,"RING finger protein 4 (RNF4) is a multifunctional small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase (STUbL) ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, and which mainly participates in DNA repair and in chromatin and transcriptional regulation. Although RNF4 has been implicated in hematopoietic disorders, its ontogenic role during hematopoietic development remains undiscovered. We generated a zebrafish rnf4 knockout line by using transcription activator–like effector nucleases technology to address the impact of rnf4 during hematopoiesis. Rnf4-deficient zebrafish embryos exhibited sharply decreased neutrophils numbers during both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. Mechanistic studies revealed that repression of the key granulocytic activator, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (c/ebpα), via promoter hypermethylation by SUMOylated DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was the main cause of impaired granulopoiesis in rnf4-deficient zebrafish. In addition, for the first time, we identified DNMT1 as a potential new STUbL substrate of RNF4, with knockdown of dnmt1 largely restoring primitive and definitive granulopoiesis in raf4-deficient zebrafish. Collectively, RNF4 is indispensable for zebrafish granulopoiesis through regulation of the DNMT1-C/EBPα functional axis.—Wang, L., Liu, X., Wang, H., Yuan, H., Chen, S., Chen, Z., de The, H., Zhou, J., Zhu, J.
