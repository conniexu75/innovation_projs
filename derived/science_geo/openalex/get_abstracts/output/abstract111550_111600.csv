https://openalex.org/W2080592158,"Mice carrying null mutations in the myogenic regulatory factors Myf-5 or MyoD have apparently normal skeletal muscle. To address whether these two factors functionally substitute for one another in myogenesis, mice carrying mutant Myf-5 and MyoD genes were interbred. While mice lacking both MyoD and Myf-5 were born alive, they were immobile and died soon after birth. Northern blot and S1 nuclease analyses indicated that Myf-5(-/-);MyoD(-/-) mice expressed no detectable skeletal muscle-specific mRNAs. Histological examination of these mice revealed a complete absence of skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated an absence of desmin-expressing myoblast-like cells. These observations suggest that either Myf-5 or MyoD is required for the determination of skeletal myoblasts, their propagation, or both during embryonic development and indicate that these factors play, at least in part, functionally redundant roles in myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094111001,"A recently defined family of cytokines, consisting of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), utilize the Jak-Tyk family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. The beta receptor components for this cytokine family, gp130 and LIF receptor beta, constitutively associate with Jak-Tyk kinases. Activation of these kinases occurs as a result of ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor beta components. Unlike other cytokine receptors studied to date, the receptors for the CNTF cytokine family utilize all known members of the Jak-Tyk family, but induce distinct patterns of Jak-Tyk phosphorylation in different cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W1999028040,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, interleukin-11, and ciliary neurotrophic factor bind to receptor complexes that share the signal transducer gp130. Upon binding, the ligands rapidly activate DNA binding of acute-phase response factor (APRF), a protein antigenically related to the p91 subunit of the interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 alpha (ISGF-3 alpha). These cytokines caused tyrosine phosphorylation of APRF and ISGF-3 alpha p91. Protein kinases of the Jak family were also rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated, and both APRF and Jak1 associated with gp130. These data indicate that Jak family protein kinases may participate in IL-6 signaling and that APRF may be activated in a complex with gp130."

https://openalex.org/W2114379433,"A functionally critical position (Q/R site) of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR-B is controlled by RNA editing that operates in the nucleus, since in brain and clonal cell lines of neural origin, unspliced GluR-B transcripts occur edited in the Q/R site CAG codon and, additionally, in intronic adenosines. Transfection of GluR-B gene constructs into PC12 cells revealed that the proximal part of the intron downstream of the unedited exonic site is required for Q/R site editing. This intron portion contains an imperfect inverted repeat preceding a 10 nt sequence with exact complementarity to the exon centered on the unedited codon. Single nucleotide substitutions in this short intronic sequence or its exonic complement curtailed Q/R site editing, which was recovered by restoring complementarity in the respective partner strand. Base conversion in the channel-coding region of GluR-B directed by base paired sequences may be executed by a ubiquitous nuclear adenosine deaminase specific for double-stranded RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2070660603,"We are undertaking a genetic approach to investigate the role that synaptic modulation in the mammalian central nervous system plays in learning and memory and to identify relevant molecular components. We have generated mice deficient in the gamma isoform of protein kinase C (PKC gamma), an enzyme that has previously been implicated in both long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning and memory. These mice have a modified LTP of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We demonstrate that PKC gamma-mutant mice can learn to carry out hippocampus-dependent tasks, although mild deficits are evident. Thus, hippocampal CA1 LTP induced by the conventional tetanic stimulation is not essential for the mice to exhibit spatial and contextual learning. Furthermore, the modification of hippocampal synaptic plasticity correlates with the learning deficits we observe."

https://openalex.org/W2020869636,"Calcium-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) has long been suggested to play an important role in modulating synaptic efficacy. We have created a strain of mice that lacks the gamma subtype of PKC to evaluate the significance of this brain-specific PKC isozyme in synaptic plasticity. Mutant mice are viable, develop normally, and have synaptic transmission that is indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Long-term potentiation (LTP), however, is greatly diminished in mutant animals, while two other forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term depression and paired-pulse facilitation, are normal. Surprisingly, when tetanus to evoke LTP was preceded by a low frequency stimulation, mutant animals displayed apparently normal LTP. We propose that PKC gamma is not part of the molecular machinery that produces LTP but is a key regulatory component."
https://openalex.org/W2092079020,"N-CAM is abundantly expressed in the nervous system in the form of numerous structural variants with characteristic distribution patterns and functional properties. N-CAM-180, the variant having the largest cytoplasmic domain, is expressed by all neurons. The N-CAM-180-specific exon 18 has been deleted to generate homozygous mice unable to express this N-CAM form. The most conspicuous mutant phenotype was in the olfactory bulb, where granule cells were both reduced in number and disorganized. In addition, precursors of these cells were found to be accumulated at their origin in the subependymal zone at the lateral ventricle. Analysis of the mutant in this region suggests that the mutant phenotype involves a defect in cell migration, possibly through specific loss of the polysialylated form of N-CAM-180, which is expressed in the migration pathway. Subtle but distinct abnormalities also were observed in other regions of the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1963868441,"Yeast RNA polymerase II initiation factor b, homolog of human TFIIH, is a protein kinase capable of phosphorylating the C-terminal repeat domain of the polymerase; it possesses a DNA-dependent ATPase activity as well. The 85 kd and 50 kd subunits of factor b are now identified as RAD3 and SSL1 proteins, respectively; both are known to be involved in DNA repair. Factor b interacts specifically with another DNA repair protein, SSL2. The ATPase activity of factor b may be due entirely to that associated with a helicase function of RAD3. Factor b transcriptional activity was unaffected, however, by amino acid substitution at a conserved residue in the RAD3 nucleotide-binding domain, suggesting that the ATPase/helicase function is not required for transcription. These results identify factor b as a core repairosome, which may be responsible for the preferential repair of actively transcribed genes in eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1969390276,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional factor that regulates many aspects of cellular functions. TGF-beta signals through a heteromeric complex of the type I and type II TGF-beta receptors. However, the molecular mechanism of signal transduction by this receptor complex remains unresolved. The type II receptor belongs to a transmembrane receptor serine-threonine kinase family. A new member of this receptor family (R4) was identified and shown to be a functional TGF-beta type I receptor on the basis of its ability to restore a TGF-beta-induced gene response in mutant cell lines lacking endogenous type I receptor. Both ligand binding and signaling of the R4 protein were dependent on the presence of a functional type II receptor. The type I receptor has an intrinsic serine-threonine kinase activity, which was essential for signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2003961668,"The Ca2+-activated K+ current IAHP , which underlies spike frequency adaptation in cortical pyramidal cells, can be modulated by multiple transmitters and probably contributes to state control of the forebrain by ascending monoaminergic fibers. Here, we show that the modulation of this current by norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine is mediated by protein kinase A in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Two specific protein kinase A inhibitors, Rp-cAMPS and Walsh peptide, suppressed the effects of these transmitters on IAHP and spike frequency adaptation. The effects of the cyclic AMP analog 8CPT-cAMP were also inhibited, whereas muscarinic and metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists had full effect. Intracellular application of protein kinase A catalytic subunit or a phosphatase inhibitor mimicked the effects of monoamines or 8CPT-CAMP. These results demonstrate that monoaminergic modulation of neuronal excitability in the mammalian CNS is mediated by protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2030419485,"The relationship between calcium influx and the gating of transmitter release was examined at the release face of a cholinergic presynaptic nerve terminal using a technique that allows the simultaneous recording of both calcium channels at the single-channel level and quantal acetylcholine secretion. Acetylcholine release occurred during large inward calcium currents through many simultaneously open channels but was also gated by very small calcium transients, admitting less than 200 ions, when only one channel was open at a time. These findings provide functional support for a highly structured model of the transmitter release face in which the synaptic vesicle release mechanism is closely tethered to one or more presynaptic calcium channels and the opening of only one of these may be sufficient to trigger quantal secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1487884828,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are obligatory for receptor binding and mitogenic activity of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The capacity of various species of heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) to promote bFGF receptor binding was investigated using both Chinese hamster ovary mutant cells deficient in cell surface HSPG and a soluble bFGF receptor-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein. Highly sulfated oligosaccharides were more effective than medium and low sulfate fractions of the same size oligosaccharide. O-Sulfation in heparin was found to be critical for its capacity to promote binding of bFGF to its receptors. The highest level of bFGF-receptor binding was achieved in the presence of over-sulfated heparin fragments (% sulfur > 14) regardless of whether the N-position was sulfated or acetylated. Unlike receptor binding of bFGF which requires oligosaccharides containing at least 8-10 sugar units, displacement of heparin- or HS-bound bFGF was obtained by oligosaccharides containing as little as four sugar units and by an N-sulfated, O-desulfated heparin fragment (% sulfur = 5.3). A preparation of total cell surface-derived HS induced bFGF receptor binding. A preliminary survey of several defined and affinity purified species of cell surface HSPG, including syndecan, fibroglycan, and glypican failed to identify natural HSPG that promote high affinity receptor binding of bFGF. A similar lack of activity was observed with species of HS isolated from bovine arterial tissue and characterized for their effect on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, most of these species of HS inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the restoration of bFGF-receptor binding induced by heparin or by total HSPG. These results suggest the involvement of defined heparin-like oligosaccharide sequences and unique species of cell surface and extracellular matrix HS in the regulation of bFGF receptor binding and biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W2027310516,"Selective activation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase type I (cAKI), but not type II, is sufficient to mediate inhibition of T cell replication induced through the antigen-specific T cell receptor-CD3 (TCR-CD3) complex. Immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation studies of the molecular mechanism by which cAKI inhibits TCR-CD3-dependent T cell replication demonstrated that regulatory subunit I alpha, along with its associated kinase activity, translocated to and interacted with the TCR-CD3 complex during T cell activation and capping. Regulatory subunit II alpha did not. When stimulated by cAMP, the cAKI localized to the TCR-CD3 complex may release kinase activity that, through phosphorylation, might uncouple the TCR-CD3 complex from intracellular signaling systems."
https://openalex.org/W1966192701,"Activation of transcription initiation by the cI protein of phage lambda is thought to be mediated by a direct interaction between cl and RNA polymerase at the PRM promoter. Two negatively charged amino acid residues in the DNA binding domain of cI play a key role in activation, suggesting that these residues contact RNA polymerase. The subunit of RNA polymerase involved was identified by selecting polymerase mutants that restored the activation function of a mutant form of cI protein. Although previous studies suggest that several activators interact with the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, the results here suggest that cI interacts with the sigma subunit. An arginine to histidine change near the carboxyl terminus of sigma specifically suppresses an aspartic acid to asparagine change in the activation region of cI. This finding supports the direct-contact model and suggests that a cluster of positively charged residues near the carboxyl terminus of sigma is the target of the negatively charged activation region of cI."

https://openalex.org/W2065088295,"Abstract Most retroviruses and retrotransposons express their pol gene as a translational fusion to the upstream gag gene, often involving translational frameshifting. We describe here an unusual translational frameshift event occurring between the GAG3 and POL3 genes of the retrotransposon Ty3 of yeast. A +1 frameshift occurs within the sequence GCG AGU U (shown as codons of GAG3 ), encoding alanine-valine (GCG A GUU). Unlike other programed translational frameshifts described, this event does not require tRNA slippage between cognate or near-cognate codons in the mRNA. Two features distal to the GCG codon stimulate frameshifting. The low availability of the tRNA specific for the hungry serine codon, AGU, induces a translational pause required for frameshifting. A sequence of 12 nt distal to the AGU codon (termed the Ty3. context) also stimulates the event."

https://openalex.org/W1999232665,"Release of GABA from the terminals of hippocampal inhibitory neurons is inhibited by activation of GABAB autoreceptors and mu opioid receptors. However, it is not known whether these presynaptic processes affect all inhibitory synapses equally. We examined the effects of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen and the mu opioid receptor agonist DAGO on postsynaptic currents evoked by minimal stimulation of inhibitory fibers (meIPSCs) in area CA3. Baclofen reversibly depressed approximately half of the meIPSCs evoked in the stratum pyramidale. The remaining meIPSCs were unaffected despite a coincident depression of spontaneous IPSCs. In contrast, all meIPSCs were depressed by DAGO. In addition, minimal stimulation in the stratum radiatum evoked meIPSCs that were always depressed by baclofen. These results indicate that regulation of GABA release by GABAB autoreceptors occurs at a subset of inhibitory synapses and that GABAB-resistant inhibitory synapses are located on pyramidal neuron somata. Hippocampal inhibitory neurons may be heterogeneous with respect to presynaptic receptor-mediated regulation of GABA release."
https://openalex.org/W1970446592,"Interphase cytosol extracts prepared from Xenopus laevis eggs are active in RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcription. Addition of recombinant B1 cyclin to these extracts activates mitotic protein kinases that repress transcription. Affinity-purified p34cdc2-cyclin B kinase (mitosis-promoting factor) is sufficient to effect this repression in a simplified Pol III transcription system. This mitotic repression involves the direct phosphorylation of a component of the Pol III transcription initiation factor TFIIIB, which consists of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and associated Pol III-specific factors. The transcriptional activity of the TFIIIB-TBP fraction can be modulated in vitro by phosphorylation with mitotic kinases and by dephosphorylation with immobilized alkaline phosphatase."

In this report we have investigated the interaction of both proteins using neurite outgrowth and binding assays. Antibody blocking experiments demonstrate that neurite extension of tectal cells on immobilized F11 is mediated by Nr-CAM/Bravo. Binding studies further reveal a direct heterophilic interaction between F11 and Nr-CAM/Bravo. This activity can be mapped to the amino-terminal second or third immunoglobulin-like domain within F11 with domain-specific monoclonal antibodies and deletion mutant proteins expressed on COS cells. Furthermore, perturbation experiments with domain-specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrate that this region is required for adhesion and neurite extension."
https://openalex.org/W1484844655,"The mechanism by which group A streptococci produce the antiphagocytic hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid) capsule is incompletely understood. Enzymes known to be essential for synthesis of this polysaccharide include the membrane-associated hyaluronate synthase as well as those required for production of the substrate sugars UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid. In this study, a Tn916 insertion that inactivates hyaluronate synthetic activity was localized to a gene designated hasA in the hyaluronic acid synthesis operon. This gene has recently been preliminarily identified as the group A streptococcal hyaluronate synthase. The DNA sequence and transcription start site of hasA were determined, and the predicted HasA protein was shown to have characteristics of a membrane protein. Amino acid sequence homology suggests that HasA is related to a family of proteins involved in polysaccharide production and cell differentiation. Finally, in addition to the loss of hyaluronate synthase activity, the hasA::Tn916 insertion was demonstrated to correlate with a loss of UDP-glucuronic acid dehydrogenase activity. These results suggest that the genes required for hyaluronate synthase activity and production of the UDP-glucuronic acid substrate are transcribed as a unit in group A streptococci."

https://openalex.org/W2047590658,"Programmed cell death (PCD) of sympathetic neurons is inhibited by nerve growth factor. However, factors that induce PCD of these cells are unknown. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor, neuropoietic cytokines known to regulate sympathetic neuron gene expression, were examined for effects on survival of cultured sympathetic neurons. Treatment with LIF or ciliary neurotrophic factor caused neuronal death in a dose-dependent fashion. Inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis, or treatment with potassium, all of which prevent PCD after nerve growth factor deprivation, prevented LIF-induced death. The morphologic and ultrastructural characteristics of the neuronal death induced by LIF and by nerve growth factor deprivation were similar. Furthermore, LIF treatment resulted in DNA fragmentation with a characteristic ""ladder"" on Southern blot analysis. These observations suggest that neuron numbers may be regulated by factors which initiate PCD, as well as by factors which prevent it."
https://openalex.org/W1599102178,"In vertebrate organisms, the molecular mechanisms by which extracellular signals regulate mitochondrial function and biogenesis are largely unknown. We have previously identified multiple cis-acting elements in both cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) genes that are likely targets for the regulated expression of respiratory chain components. We now demonstrate that cytochrome c but not COXIV mRNA is induced by cAMP through a mechanism involving transcriptional activation. Maximal induction occurs within 3 h and does not require de novo protein synthesis. The differential response of these genes is mediated by two distinct cAMP response elements (CREs) in the cytochrome c promoter region. Both elements function independently to drive cAMP-dependent expression from a heterologous promoter and within the proper cytochrome c promoter context. In addition, the binding properties of both elements to nuclear factors were characterized by competition DNase I footprinting, methylation interference footprinting, site-directed mutagenesis, and UV-induced DNA-protein cross-linking. The results are all consistent with the specific recognition of both CREs by CRE binding protein (CREB). A highly purified preparation of recombinant CREB formed a specific complex with each of the cytochrome c CREs identical to that formed with a crude nuclear fraction. In addition, the trans-activation of cytochrome c gene expression by recombinant CREB and protein kinase A in transfected cells was completely dependent on functional CREs within the promoter. These results establish that respiratory chain gene expression can be regulated directly by cAMP through a CREB-dependent signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1612440958,"Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is one of the most potent stimulators of bone resorption. However, the early biochemical events elicited by IL-1 receptor binding are not fully understood. Here we show that in human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells the treatment with IL-1 alpha is able to evoke a rapid and transient increase of nuclear phospholipase C (PLC) activity. A parallel decrease of nuclear phosphatidylinositol monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate is observed. All these events are strictly confined to the nuclear compartment without affecting the cytoplasmatic inositol lipid pool. In addition we show that by Western blot analysis with specific monoclonal antibodies the PLC gamma is located both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, while PLC beta appears exclusively localized in the nucleus. Moreover, the increase of PLC activity in response to IL-1 alpha is completely neutralized by monoclonal antibody against the beta-form. While confirming the existence of an autonomous nuclear phosphoinositide signaling system, our data clearly indicate that in SaOS-2 cells one of the earliest events following IL-1 alpha treatment is the breakdown of nuclear phosphatidylinositol monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate because of the activation of a specific nuclear PLC isoform."
https://openalex.org/W1520970475,"It has previously been shown that in fat cells, the intracellular reservoir of the glucose transporter isoform GLUT4 consists of a membrane vesicle population highly enriched in this transporter (approximately 15% of the protein content) that has a relatively simple protein pattern as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (Zorzano, A., Wilkinson, W., Kotliar, N., Thoidis, G., Wadzinski, B. E., Ruoho, A. E., and Pilch, P. F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12358-12363). Upon exposure of adipocytes to insulin, the cell-surface (plasma membrane) content of GLUT4 is dramatically enhanced, and this transporter appears to continually cycle from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. To identify other proteins that may recycle in a similar fashion to GLUT4 and that may participate in the insulin-dependent alteration in the cellular location of GLUT4 and other membrane proteins, we performed immunoadsorption of GLUT4-enriched vesicles together with biotinylation of membranes using a cell-impermeant analog of biotin. We find that immunoadsorbed GLUT4-containing vesicles can be fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The first includes three major glycoprotein components with molecular masses of 110, 160, and 230 kDa and a few minor polypeptides with lower molecular masses. A Triton X-100-resistant fraction consists of GLUT4 and an approximately 25-kDa protein. All three major Triton-soluble proteins (110, 160, and 230 kDa) isolated from the immunoimmobilized vesicles on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose are strongly biotinylated in an insulin-dependent fashion, i.e. they cycle to and from the cell surface in an apparently identical manner to GLUT4. Sequence analysis of two tryptic fragments from p160 reveals that it is a novel protein containing sequence with no homology to known proteins."

ITTX-R was found in both putative stellate and putative pyramidal neurons from the medial entorhinal cortex. ITTX-R is kinetically indistinguishable from ITTX-S, but can be distinguished from ITTX-S based on its enhanced sensitivity to block by Cd2+, La3+, and Zn2+. ITTX-R is kinetically and pharmacologically similar to the TTX-resistant Na+ current found in cardiac muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1979585655,"The pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cell line P19 can differentiate in vitro into neurons and astrocytes. By employing this neural cell differentiation system, we have studied the expression and function of a POU transcription factor implicated in mammalian neurogenesis. When P19 cells differentiated to the neural cells, one of the CNS-specific POU genes (Brn-2) was selectively induced. The induction of Brn-2 was specific to the neural cell lineages and took place at the early stage of differentiation. When the Brn-2 induction was blocked/delayed by antisense RNA, such cells were unable to differentiate to neurons and astrocytes. Instead they differentiated to nonneural cells, including smooth and skeletal muscle cells. Furthermore, with reduced levels of antisense RNA, differentiation to neural cells occurred. These results indicate that Brn-2 is essential for the neural cell differentiation of P19 cells and suggest that Brn-2 is one of the genes required for establishing neural cell lineages in mammals."

The cDNA was identical to that encoding G alpha i2 except that the region encoding for the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids was replaced by a longer region encoding 35 amino acids that have no sequence similarity with G alpha i2 or other members of the G protein family. This alternative spliced product and the corresponding protein (sGi2) were present in several tissues. Specific antibodies revealed that sGi2 was localized in the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in membrane transport. Thus, alternative splicing may generate from a single gene two G protein alpha subunits with differential cellular localization and function."

https://openalex.org/W1548004194,"Tissue factor (TF), an integral membrane protein, is the cofactor for the serine protease, coagulation factor VIIa (FVIIa). Previous studies of the isolated extracellular domain of TF (sTF) reported a kcat for factor X (FX) activation by the sTF.VIIa complex only 4% that of wild-type TF.VIIa and furthermore, a complete inability of sTF to support FVII autoactivation. We now report that in the presence of poly(L-lysine), sTF promoted both FX activation and FVII autoactivation, the latter with an apparent second-order rate constant higher than reported previously for wild-type TF in phospholipid vesicles. This led us to reexamine the cofactor ability of sTF, using high concentrations of phospholipid to promote nearly quantitative binding of sTF.VII(a) complexes to the phospholipid surface. Rate constants for the activation of FX or FVII by sTF.VIIa were similar to those of wild-type TF.VIIa, indicating that the apparent deficiency of sTF is largely attributable to kinetic consequences of relatively weak affinity of FVIIa (and sTF.VIIa) for phospholipid surfaces in these surface-dependent reactions, compared with TF being embedded in the membrane. This supports the notion that sTF recapitulates the protein-protein interactions of wild-type TF with high, and possibly full, catalytic activity. It also provides a biochemical explanation for the specificity of our recently described, sTF-based clotting assay for plasma FVIIa."

When isolated whole or ventral, but not lateral, neural plate fragments from stage 9 embryos were cultured for 4 days in collagen gels, floor plate and neural markers were observed. Our results suggest that floor plate and motor neurons can form in a delayed fashion in vivo after notochord ablation and in vitro from isolated neural plates. This suggests that either there is an early induction of floor plate by the chordamesoderm of Hensen's node, or only limited interactions between the neural plate and notochord immediately after neurulation are required for floor plate determination."

Insulitis developed in both sets of transgenic animals with most of the lymphocytes in the lesion expressing the transgenic beta chain and with depletion of the endogenous TCR V beta genes.

https://openalex.org/W1500367626,"A modified method for the synthesis and separation of endo and exo guanosine 2',3'-cyclophosphorothioate (cGPS) has been developed. The exo diastereoisomer has been co-crystallized with RNase T1. cGPS is known to be a RNase T1 inhibitor but is also a very slow substrate. It was hydrolyzed during the crystallization, leaving 3'-guanylic acid (3'-GMP) in the active site. As a guanosine was also found to be bound in a subsite, the enzyme contains the products of the reaction of guanylyl-3',5'-guanosine. The structure was refined to a resolution of 1.7 A and yielded a final R value of 14.5%. In contrast to previous 3'-GMP complexes of RNase T1, the ribose phosphate moiety of the inhibitor is in contact with all the active site residues. The phosphate forms hydrogen bonds with Asn36, Tyr38, Arg77, His92, and with Asn49 from a symmetry-related molecule. The ribose 2'-OH is hydrogen-bonded to both Glu58 and His40. The interactions in the active site of the present structure are compared to those found in the 2'-GMP complex of RNase T1."
https://openalex.org/W1516064099,"p-Hydroxyphenylacetate-3-hydroxylase purified from Pseudomonas putida is a two-protein enzyme requiring a flavoprotein and a coupling protein for productive hydroxylation (Arunachalam, U., Massey, V., and Vaidyanathan, C. S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25848-25855). This paper presents information on the mechanism of the enzyme from absorbance and fluorescence stopped-flow studies. The reduction of the substrate-free flavoprotein by NADH was slow and was not altered by the presence of the coupling protein. In contrast, the coupling protein has a dramatic effect in the oxidative half-reaction. The flavoprotein when present alone, both in the absence and presence of the aromatic substrate, reacts in a second-order fashion with oxygen to form oxidized flavoprotein, with no indication of flavin-oxygen intermediates. However, an intermediate identified as the C4a-flavin hydroperoxide is stabilized when the flavoprotein-coupling protein complex reacts with oxygen in the absence of the aromatic substrate, p-hydroxyphenylacetate, and at least three flavin-oxygen intermediates, attributed to the anionic (I) and protonated (I*) forms of the flavin hydroperoxide and the hydroxyflavin (III), are formed in the oxidative half-reaction in the presence of the aromatic substrate. A reaction mechanism for the two-protein complex is proposed in which the aromatic substrate has little effect on the rate of reduction of the enzyme flavin but has strict control in the oxidative half-reaction. In this phase the flavin hydroperoxide is remarkably stable in the absence of the substrate but disappears rapidly upon encountering the aromatic substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1579699087,"The insulin receptor mediates a variety of cellular responses to insulin, including glucose transport, endocytosis, and cell proliferation. The role of the insulin receptor in mediating cellular motility has not, however, been extensively investigated. In this report, we demonstrate that chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that normally have low concentrations of insulin receptor display chemotaxis toward insulin after overexpression of the wild type human insulin receptor. Chemotaxis toward insulin proceeded through a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway and required both tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine autophosphorylation of the regulatory region of the beta-subunit. In contrast, the autophosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus of the receptor were not required for chemotactic activity. A mutation in the juxtamembrane region, which disabled tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), also prevented the chemotactic response, suggesting a possible role for IRS-1 in chemotactic signaling. In the absence of insulin receptor, however, the presence of excess transfected IRS-1 was not sufficient to mediate chemotaxis toward insulin. These results demonstrate that the intact insulin receptor can stimulate a chemotactic signaling pathway and that this initial pathway more closely correlates with that for insulin-stimulated cell proliferation than for insulin-stimulated receptor endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1998578057,"Fluorescent x-ray interference patterns have been observed from monolayers of both a metal-containing protein (ferritin) and a nonmetal-containing protein [bovine serum albumin (BSA)] bound on a gold substrate. These interference patterns have been used to determine structure data. The nonmetal-containing protein was first reacted with metal ions by means of a chelate compound to place the necessary chromophore in the molecule. The size of the ferritin core measured by a scanning electron microscope agrees with the value obtained from the x-ray interference experiments. In the BSA molecule, the measured interference fringe is consistent with the model in which the short axes of BSA molecules are perpendicular to the surface substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1491566690,"We report the purification and characterization of glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, the first of five enzymes committed to biosynthesis of CDP-D-abequose from Salmonella enterica strain LT2. The purification was greatly facilitated by using a cloned rfbF gene encoding this enzyme. Pure enzyme was obtained by 64-fold enrichment in three chromatography steps. The NH2-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme was in agreement with the sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the rfbF gene. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis estimated subunit M(r) of 31,000 agrees well with the M(r) of 29,035 calculated from the amino acid composition deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the rfbF gene. The glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase catalyzes a reversible bimolecular group transfer reaction and steady-state kinetic measurements, including product inhibition patterns, indicate that this reaction proceeds by a ping-pong type of mechanism. The Km values for CTP, alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate, CDP-D-glucose, and pyrophosphate are 0.28, 0.64, 0.11, and 1.89 mM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1593825177,"Isotopic labeling of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and EPR spectroscopy have been used to demonstrate that photosystem II contains two redox active tyrosines, D and Z (Barry, B. A. and Babcock, G. T. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 7099-7103; Boerner, R. J. and Barry, B. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17151-17154). Another organic radical, M+, has recently been observed in site-directed mutants in which a non-redox active amino acid is substituted at either the putative D or putative Z sites (Boerner, R. J., Bixby, K. A., Nguyen, A. P., Noren, G. H., Debus, R. J., and Barry, B. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 1817-1823; Noren, G. H., and Barry, B. A. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 3335-3342). Here, we use isotopic labeling to determine the chemical identity of M+. Upon incorporation of perdeuterated tyrosine into photosystem II, the M+ EPR signal narrows to approximately 12-13 G. Labeling with 3,5-deuterated tyrosine results in an isotropic doublet with splittings of 11 G. Our results show that M+ is a tyrosine radical with unique spectroscopic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1525776009,"This study was designed to investigate the function of intravesicular proton on two pH gradient-dependent transport processes, a novel Na-HCO3 cotransport and a Na-H exchange, that are present in basolateral membrane vesicles of rat distal colon. Increasing intravesicular proton concentration saturated 22Na uptake via both Na-H exchange and Na-HCO3 cotransport; reduced the apparent Km for sodium for Na-H exchange from 94.9 to 35.6 mM, without alteration in the Vmax; but enhanced the Vmax for Na-HCO3 cotransport from 4.3 to 11.7 nmol/mg protein.6 s, while not changing the Km for sodium. The effect of a 10-fold proton concentration gradient at two different absolute proton concentrations on both systems was also determined. 22Na uptake via Na-HCO3 cotransport, but not via Na-H exchange, was enhanced at the higher proton concentration, indicating that the magnitude of the proton concentration gradient is primarily responsible for proton stimulation of Na-H exchange, whereas the absolute proton concentration is critical for proton enhancement of Na-HCO3 cotransport. These studies also demonstrate saturation of both transport systems as a function of intravesicular proton concentration without an exponential component. These results indicate that proton stimulated Na-H exchange and Na-HCO3 cotransport are regulated by distinct and separate mechanisms that may reflect their different cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1990851356,"U6 RNA contains two regions that are essential for proper splicing of nuclear precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). A comparison of putative secondary structures of the U6-U4 RNA complexes from different phyla revealed a conserved domain that is similar to the catalytic hammerhead RNA motif. Although no catalytic activity was detected in the mammalian U6-U4 RNA complexes, two nucleotide changes in U6 RNA and one in U4 RNA conferred cleavage activity to the complex. Furthermore, the highly conserved domain of the wild-type complex, without the accompanying flanking regions, cleaved an RNA substrate and exhibited other characteristics of the hammerhead ribozyme. The possible involvement of this structure in pre-mRNA splicing is also discussed."
