https://openalex.org/W3107800096,"Driving the pores away The formation of “keyholes” (vapor-filled depressions) during additive manufacturing leads to porosity, which degrades alloy performance, especially fracture properties, and remains a big challenge for the 3D printing of metals. Zhao et al. used high-speed x-ray imaging to take a detailed look at how keyhole formation connects to porosity in a titanium alloy. They found that instability at the keyhole tip drives pores away to get trapped in the solidification front. Understanding this process and the operating parameters under which it occurs provides a roadmap for avoiding porosity and building high-quality metal parts. Science , this issue p. 1080"

Nevertheless, our understanding of how gut bacteria modulate the immune system remains limited, particularly in humans, where the difficulty of direct experimentation makes inference challenging. Here we study hundreds of hospitalized-and closely monitored-patients with cancer receiving haematopoietic cell transplantation as they recover from chemotherapy and stem-cell engraftment. This aggressive treatment causes large shifts in both circulatory immune cell and microbiota populations, enabling the relationships between the two to be studied simultaneously. Analysis of observed daily changes in circulating neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts and more than 10,000 longitudinal microbiota samples revealed consistent associations between gut bacteria and immune cell dynamics. High-resolution clinical metadata and Bayesian inference allowed us to compare the effects of bacterial genera in relation to those of immunomodulatory medications, revealing a considerable influence of the gut microbiota-together and over time-on systemic immune cell dynamics. Our analysis establishes and quantifies the link between the gut microbiota and the human immune system, with implications for microbiota-driven modulation of immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3109641046,"A dsRNA detector in the immune toolkit Nod-like receptor (NLR) proteins recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns within cells, which triggers the formation of signaling complexes called inflammasomes. These complexes then initiate pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death. Recent work has shown that a rhinovirus protease can activate the human NLRP1 inflammasome, but it was unclear whether this is the only pathogen-derived trigger for NLRP1. Bauernfried et al. report that long, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) generated in the course of Semliki Forest virus infection binds and activates NLRP1 in epithelial cells. dsRNA binding triggered NLRP1 to acquire adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, a common feature of activated NLR proteins. Thus, in addition to its ability to recognize viral protease activity, human NLRP1 can act as a genuine sensor of virus-associated nucleic acids. Science , this issue p. eabd0811"
https://openalex.org/W3109256700,"Limits to the growing season The length of the growing season in temperate forests has been increasing under recent climate change because of earlier leaf emergence and later leaf senescence. However, Zani et al. show that this trend might be reversed as increasing photosynthetic productivity begins to drive earlier autumn leaf senescence (see the Perspective by Rollinson). Using a combination of experimental, observational, and modeling studies based on European forest trees, the researchers conclude that leaf senescence will advance by 3 to 6 days by the end of the 21st century rather than lengthening by 1 to 3 weeks as current phenological models have predicted. In turn, this predicted phenological pattern will limit the capacity of temperate forests to mitigate climate change through carbon uptake. Science , this issue p. 1066 ; see also p. 1030"
https://openalex.org/W3110348288,"The quantum spin properties of nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond enable diverse applications in quantum computing and communications1. However, fluorescent nanodiamonds also have attractive properties for in vitro biosensing, including brightness2, low cost3 and selective manipulation of their emission4. Nanoparticle-based biosensors are essential for the early detection of disease, but they often lack the required sensitivity. Here we investigate fluorescent nanodiamonds as an ultrasensitive label for in vitro diagnostics, using a microwave field to modulate emission intensity5 and frequency-domain analysis6 to separate the signal from background autofluorescence7, which typically limits sensitivity. Focusing on the widely used, low-cost lateral flow format as an exemplar, we achieve a detection limit of 8.2 × 10-19 molar for a biotin-avidin model, 105 times more sensitive than that obtained using gold nanoparticles. Single-copy detection of HIV-1 RNA can be achieved with the addition of a 10-minute isothermal amplification step, and is further demonstrated using a clinical plasma sample with an extraction step. This ultrasensitive quantum diagnostics platform is applicable to numerous diagnostic test formats and diseases, and has the potential to transform early diagnosis of disease for the benefit of patients and populations."
https://openalex.org/W3108158555,"We report a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis, including whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and proteomics and phosphoproteomics profiling, of 218 tumors across 7 histological types of childhood brain cancer: low-grade glioma (n = 93), ependymoma (32), high-grade glioma (25), medulloblastoma (22), ganglioglioma (18), craniopharyngioma (16), and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (12). Proteomics data identify common biological themes that span histological boundaries, suggesting that treatments used for one histological type may be applied effectively to other tumors sharing similar proteomics features. Immune landscape characterization reveals diverse tumor microenvironments across and within diagnoses. Proteomics data further reveal functional effects of somatic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) not evident in transcriptomics data. Kinase-substrate association and co-expression network analysis identify important biological mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This is the first large-scale proteogenomics analysis across traditional histological boundaries to uncover foundational pediatric brain tumor biology and inform rational treatment selection."

To reveal these causes, we used a multi-omics, systems biology analytical approach using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts and data from NASA's GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space to determine transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic responses to spaceflight. Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omics datasets showed significant enrichment for mitochondrial processes, as well as innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions. Importantly, NASA's Twin Study provided a platform to confirm several of our principal findings. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight."

However, such studies may be required to identify pathological gene variants with effects in specific cells along a developmental trajectory. To study the function of genes implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), Jin et al. applied a gene-editing and single-cell–sequencing system, Perturb-Seq, to knock out 35 ASD candidate genes in multiple mice embryos (see the Perspective by Treutlein and Camp).

https://openalex.org/W3107392386,"The generation, control and transfer of triplet excitons in molecular and hybrid systems is of great interest owing to their long lifetime and diffusion length in both solid-state and solution phase systems, and to their applications in light emission1, optoelectronics2,3, photon frequency conversion4,5 and photocatalysis6,7. Molecular triplet excitons (bound electron–hole pairs) are ‘dark states’ because of the forbidden nature of the direct optical transition between the spin-zero ground state and the spin-one triplet levels8. Hence, triplet dynamics are conventionally controlled through heavy-metal-based spin–orbit coupling9–11 or tuning of the singlet–triplet energy splitting12,13 via molecular design. Both these methods place constraints on the range of properties that can be modified and the molecular structures that can be used. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to control triplet dynamics by coupling organic molecules to lanthanide-doped inorganic insulating nanoparticles. This allows the classically forbidden transitions from the ground-state singlet to excited-state triplets to gain oscillator strength, enabling triplets to be directly generated on molecules via photon absorption. Photogenerated singlet excitons can be converted to triplet excitons on sub-10-picosecond timescales with unity efficiency by intersystem crossing. Triplet exciton states of the molecules can undergo energy transfer to the lanthanide ions with unity efficiency, which allows us to achieve luminescent harvesting of the dark triplet excitons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the triplet excitons generated in the lanthanide nanoparticle–molecule hybrid systems by near-infrared photoexcitation can undergo efficient upconversion via a lanthanide–triplet excitation fusion process: this process enables endothermic upconversion and allows efficient upconversion from near-infrared to visible frequencies in the solid state. These results provide a new way to control triplet excitons, which is essential for many fields of optoelectronic and biomedical research. Optically dark (non-emitting) triplet excitons on organic molecules may be rendered bright by coupling the molecules to lanthanide-doped nanoparticles, providing a way to control such excitons in optoelectronic systems."

Extreme episodes of hotter and drier climate over the past 20 years, which are unprecedented in the earlier records, are caused by a positive feedback loop between soil moisture deficits and surface warming and potentially represent the start of an irreversible trend.

https://openalex.org/W3109660817,"When all routes are exceptional The exploration of non-Hermitian physics and parity-time symmetry have provided a route to develop a wealth of exotic physical effects. In such dissipative systems, the balance of gain and loss of the system lead to what are called exceptional points, or “sweet spots,” which relate to optimal device operation or material properties. The ability to tune the gain and loss over a range of system properties leads to exceptional arcs. Tang et al. show that systems can be designed in which the tuning of multiple parameters leads to a crossroads, or nexus, of exceptional arcs. Illustrating the effect in an acoustic system, the same properties should be attainable over various types of dissipative systems and thus provide a versatile route to fine-tune optimal performance of materials and devices.

Zheng et al. identified a new dual-enzyme complex called INTAC, which is composed of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) core enzyme and the multisubunit RNA endonuclease Integrator. Structural and functional studies show that INTAC functions as a noncanonical PP2A holoenzyme that dephosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II to attenuate transcription.

Combining this measurement with the data for the 1S-2S transition, the authors obtained the Rydberg constant with improved accuracy and an independent value for the proton charge radius that favors the data from muonic hydrogen.

https://openalex.org/W3108602834,"<h2>Summary</h2> Surprise signals a discrepancy between past and current beliefs. It is theorized to be linked to affective experiences, the creation of particularly resilient memories, and segmentation of the flow of experience into discrete perceived events. However, the ability to precisely measure naturalistic surprise has remained elusive. We used advanced basketball analytics to derive a quantitative measure of surprise and characterized its behavioral, physiological, and neural correlates in human subjects observing basketball games. We found that surprise was associated with segmentation of ongoing experiences, as reflected by subjectively perceived event boundaries and shifts in neocortical patterns underlying belief states. Interestingly, these effects differed by whether surprising moments contradicted or bolstered current predominant beliefs. Surprise also positively correlated with pupil dilation, activation in subcortical regions associated with dopamine, game enjoyment, and long-term memory. These investigations support key predictions from event segmentation theory and extend theoretical conceptualizations of surprise to real-world contexts."

https://openalex.org/W3108663073,"Factor-dependent transcription termination mechanisms are poorly understood. We determined a series of cryo-electron microscopy structures portraying the hexameric adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) ρ on a pathway to terminating NusA/NusG-modified elongation complexes. An open ρ ring contacts NusA, NusG, and multiple regions of RNA polymerase, trapping and locally unwinding proximal upstream DNA. NusA wedges into the ρ ring, initially sequestering RNA. Upon deflection of distal upstream DNA over the RNA polymerase zinc-binding domain, NusA rotates underneath one capping ρ subunit, which subsequently captures RNA. After detachment of NusG and clamp opening, RNA polymerase loses its grip on the RNA:DNA hybrid and is inactivated. Our structural and functional analyses suggest that ρ, and other termination factors across life, may use analogous strategies to allosterically trap transcription complexes in a moribund state."

We report the discovery of a mitoribosome-associated quality control pathway that responds to interruptions during elongation, and we present structures at 3.1- to 3.3-angstrom resolution of mitoribosomal large subunits trapped during ribosome rescue. Release factor homolog C12orf65 (mtRF-R) and RNA binding protein C6orf203 (MTRES1) eject the nascent chain and peptidyl transfer RNA (tRNA), respectively, from stalled ribosomes. Recruitment of mitoribosome biogenesis factors to these quality control intermediates suggests additional roles for these factors during mitoribosome rescue. We also report related cryo-electron microscopy structures (3.7 to 4.4 angstrom resolution) of elongating mitoribosomes bound to tRNAs, nascent polypeptides, the guanosine triphosphatase elongation factors mtEF-Tu and mtEF-G1, and the Oxa1L translocase."

Adherens junctions transmit forces between cells, but how cells sense and respond to these forces in vivo is not well understood. We identify a mechanotransduction pathway involving the Abl tyrosine kinase and Canoe/Afadin that stabilizes cell adhesion under tension at tricellular junctions in the Drosophila embryo. Canoe is recruited to tricellular junctions in response to actomyosin contractility, and this mechanosensitivity requires Abl-dependent phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine in the Canoe actin-binding domain. Preventing Canoe tyrosine phosphorylation destabilizes tricellular adhesion, and anchoring Canoe at tricellular junctions independently of mechanical inputs aberrantly stabilizes adhesion, arresting cell rearrangement. These results identify a force-responsive mechanism that stabilizes tricellular adhesion under tension during epithelial remodeling."

By single-cell RNA profiling, we observed macrophage hypo-inflammation, Kupffer cell scavenger function defects, cytotoxic T cell expansion, and deficiency of CX3CR1+effector T and natural killer (NK) cells in infants with BA. More importantly, we discovered that hepatic B cell lymphopoiesis did not cease after birth and that tolerance defects contributed to immunoglobulin G (IgG)-autoantibody accumulation in BA. In a rhesus-rotavirus induced BA model, depleting B cells or blocking antigen presentation ameliorated liver damage. In a pilot clinical study, we demonstrated that rituximab was effective in depleting hepatic B cells and restoring the functions of macrophages, Kupffer cells, and T cells to levels comparable to those of control subjects. In summary, our comprehensive immune profiling in infants with BA had educed that B-cell-modifying therapies may alleviate liver pathology."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD; OMIM: 600274) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; OMIM: 105400) are progressive neurological disorders that are characterized clinically by cognitive deficits, language abnormalities, and muscle weakness (Neary et al., 2005Neary D.

Approximately 15,000 individuals die of FTD or ALS in the United States annually (Arthur et al., 2016Arthur K.C. Calvo A. Price T.R. Geiger J.T. Chiò A. Traynor B.J.

Clinical, genetic, and neuropathologic data demonstrate that FTD and ALS are closely related conditions that exist along a spectrum of neurological disease (Lillo and Hodges, 2009Lillo P. Hodges J.R.

Neurosci. 2009; 16: 1131-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Though progress has been made, much remains unclear about the genetic etiology of the FTD/ALS spectrum. Approximately 40% of FTD cases are familial, and causative mutations have been identified, most notably in MAPT, GRN, C9orf72, and VCP (Ferrari et al., 2019Ferrari R. Manzoni C. Hardy J.

The intronic repeat expansion of the C9orf72 gene is the most common cause of FTD and ALS (Majounie et al., 2012Majounie E. Renton A.E. Mok K. Dopper E.G. Waite A. Rollinson S. Chiò A. Restagno G.

Together, these data suggest that repeat expansions play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This type of mutation may be amenable to antisense oligonucleotide therapy, adding further incentive to their identification (Tabrizi et al., 2019Tabrizi S.J. Leavitt B.R. Landwehrmeyer G.B.

From a clinical perspective, the molecular characterization of the genetic causes of disease in a patient helps to establish an accurate diagnosis and genetic counseling of the patients and their families. It is also a necessary first step toward future precision medicine. To explore the genetic architecture of neurodegenerative disorders, we performed whole-genome sequencing in patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS, Lewy body dementia (LBD), and neurologically healthy individuals and systematically assessed the role of previously identified, disease-causing repeat expansions. After quality control, whole-genome sequence data from 2,442 patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS, 2,599 LBD patients, and 3,158 neurologically healthy individuals were available for analysis.

We identified three FTD/ALS patients who carried full-penetrance pathogenic repeat expansions (≥40) in the HTT gene, representing 0.12% of the patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS disorders. The sizes of the detected HTT expansions were 41, 40, and 40 repeats, which are deemed to be fully penetrant (Table 1). In contrast, none of the LBD cases or healthy control subjects carried pathogenic HTT expansions. The lengths of the repeat expansions in these three FTD/ALS patients were confirmed by repeat-primed PCR and cloning and Sanger sequencing (Figures 1A and S1). We did not observe a higher rate of intermediate (27–35) or low-penetrance (36–39) HTT repeat expansions among patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS or LBD compared to control subjects (Figure 1B). Aside from C9orf72 as a common cause of FTD and ALS, none of the other repeat expansions evaluated by the ExpansionHunter–Targeted algorithm displayed a similar pattern of being present in cases and absent in control subjects (see Table S1). For this reason, we focused our efforts on the HTT repeat expansion in FTD/ALS patients.Table 1Pathogenic HTT Repeat Expansions within the Discovery and Replication CohortsDiscovery CohortReplication CohortaThe replication control cohort included 210 neurologically healthy controls, 13,670 population controls from Gardiner et al.

Open table in a new tab To replicate our findings, we assessed the HTT CAG repeat length in an independent cohort of 3,674 patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS spectrum disorders and 210 healthy control participants. We detected an additional five patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS who carried pathogenic HTT repeat expansions, representing 0.14% of this replication cohort (sizes 64, 40, 44, 40, and 41 for patients 4–8 in Table 1). We compared this to published data on the occurrence of HTT repeat expansions in the general population, which was only 0.03% (10 out of 31,373 individuals had ≥40 repeats) (Gardiner et al., 2019Gardiner S.L. Boogaard M.W. Trompet S. de Mutsert R. Rosendaal F.R. Gussekloo J. Jukema J.W. Roos R.A.C. Aziz N.A.

The 100,000 Genomes Project.BMJ. 2016; 353: i1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Overall, the carrier rate among patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS spectrum disorders in the discovery and replication cohorts was 4.4 times higher than that observed among healthy individuals (Fisher’s exact test p value = 2.68 × 10−3; odds ratio, 4.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.56–12.80, Table 1). None of the patients found to carry the HTT full-penetrance expansions had additional disease-causing mutations in 50 other genes implicated in FTD/ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases (see STAR Methods for the gene list). We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the FTD/ALS discovery cohort, and single-variant analysis similarly failed to identify loci that would account for our findings (Figure S2). The FTD/ALS patients carrying HTT full-penetrance repeat expansions harbored several different haplotypes that have previously been associated with this locus (Figure S3). The presence of multiple haplotypes indicated diverse ancestral sources among our samples, making it unlikely that another genetic variant outside of the expansion was causing disease in these patients. Furthermore, we did not detect interruptions within the HTT repeat expansion in any of the patients. We only encountered the loss of the CAA-CAG trailing sequence in a single individual (patient 8; Figure 1D). Additionally, we examined somatic instability across multiple brain regions obtained from the postmortem tissues of two patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS (patients 5 and 8), and from a Huntington’s disease patient carrying 41 CAG repeats (Figure 2). We utilized repeat-primed PCR GeneMapper chromatograms to quantify CAG repeat length distributions, as recently published (Mouro Pinto et al., 2020Mouro Pinto R. Arning L. Giordano J.V. Razghandi P. Andrew M.A. Gillis T. Correia K. Mysore J.S. Grote Urtubey D.M. Parwez C.R. et al.Patterns of CAG repeat instability in the central nervous system and periphery in Huntington’s disease and in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2020; 29: 2551-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Figure S4). The motor cortex and globus pallidus/putamen regions displayed the most instability in patients 5 and 8, whereas the spinal cord was among the most stable. A similar pattern was observed in the Huntington’s disease patient. The range of expansion indices (range, 0.042–0.985) observed in the FTD/ALS patients was also consistent with a study of Huntington’s disease patients carrying lower pathogenic-range HTT repeat expansions (Mouro Pinto et al., 2020Mouro Pinto R. Arning L. Giordano J.V. Razghandi P. Andrew M.A. Gillis T. Correia K. Mysore J.S. Grote Urtubey D.M.

The clinical details of the eight patients carrying the HTT full-penetrance, pathogenic repeat expansions are summarized in Table 2 and described in Methods S1 in Supplemental Information. None of the patients reported choreoathetosis. Four patients reported a family history of neurological disease. Patient 4 (Table 2) was an outlier among the cases we identified as carrying HTT pathogenic repeat expansions. She presented at 17 years of age with cognitive decline, supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, parkinsonism, postural instability, gait disturbance, spasticity, and hyperreflexia in the lower limbs. Treatment with levodopa did not yield a clinical improvement. Genetic screening of HTT performed at the time of presentation was incorrectly reported as normal, and she was initially diagnosed with FTD-progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) despite her young age. A repeat genetic panel conducted several years later to investigate possible causes of young-onset dementia correctly identified an expanded HTT repeat allele. Her diagnosis was updated to young-onset Huntington’s disease (Westphal variant). Her father had presented with a similar syndrome of cognitive decline, gait disorder, and dysarthria in his late 20s and was diagnosed with Huntington’s disease after his daughter’s genetic diagnosis.Table 2Clinical Details of the Eight Patients Carrying a Full-Penetrance Pathogenic HTT Repeat ExpansionPatientCohortCAG Repeats (A1/A2)Clinical DiagnosisAge at Onset (y)SexFamily HistoryPresenting Symptoms1discovery41/21PSP-FTD68Mno–2discovery40/16bvFTD56Fyesbehavioral changes3discovery40/17nfvPPA57Fnolanguage disturbance4replication64/17PSP-FTD17Fyesacademic decline, dysarthria, bradykinesia, and gait disturbance5replication40/15ALS56F––6replication44/28bvFTD44Myespersonality changes and apathy7replication40/19ALS76Myeslower limb weakness8replication41/17ALS61Mnoright foot weaknessClinical diagnoses include progressive supranuclear palsy, FTD type (PSP-FTD); behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD); nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia subtype of FTD (nfvPPA); and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The first patient was a woman carrying 40 HTT CAG repeats who developed ALS symptoms at the age of 56 years and died 11 years later of respiratory failure following a typical course of motor neuron disease (Table 2; patient 5). Postmortem examination showed mild atrophy of the precentral gyrus and thinning of the spinal cord anterior roots. Microscopic examination revealed classical neuropathological features of ALS; there was a loss of the motor neurons of the spinal cord and hypoglossal nuclei (Figures 3A and 3B ). Staining with anti-TDP-43 antibodies showed rare neurons with nuclear to cytoplasmic TDP-43 translocation and occasional neuropil skeins confined to the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9 [BA9]; Figure 3C). Neither aberrant TDP-43 translocation nor ubiquitinated inclusions were detected in the dentate gyrus. Interestingly, dual staining of the prefrontal cortex and striatum using anti-huntingtin/p62 antibodies showed nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates of huntingtin and p62 with the highest density observed in the infragranular layers of the prefrontal cortex (Figure 3D). Ubiquitinated nuclear inclusions were found in the tail of the caudate nucleus (Figure 3H) and the frontal cortex (not shown). However, there was no atrophy, neuronal loss, or active gliosis in the striatum (Figures 3E, 3F, 3H, and 3I). The second brain evaluated postmortem was that of a man carrying 41 CAG repeats in HTT who presented with right foot weakness at age 61 years. He was diagnosed with ALS based on disease progression and electromyography, and he died from respiratory failure 9 years after symptom onset following a typical course of motor neuron disease (patient 8; Table 2). Postmortem examination showed mild atrophy of the precentral gyrus and thinning of the anterior spinal roots. There was otherwise no cerebral cortical or striatal atrophy (Figure 4A) or evidence of neuronal loss or gliosis in the striatum on microscopic examination (Figure 4B). Staining for ubiquitin (Figure 4C) and polyglutamine showed scattered nuclear and cytoplasmic and neuropil aggregates within the striatum (Figure 4D) and motor cortex (Figure 4E). Polyglutamine aggregates were not detected in the spinal cord. There was a marked loss of spinal motor neurons (Figure 4F) and degeneration of the corticospinal tracts. Staining with anti-phospho-TDP-43 antibodies showed ALS-type TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions within some residual motor neurons (Figure 4F, inset). To confirm the specificity of our pathological findings, we examined the prefrontal cortex (BA9) obtained from postmortems of individuals without Huntington’s disease using the anti-huntingtin (2B4) immunostain previously used. These specimens consisted of four neurologically healthy individuals, three patients diagnosed with FTD/ALS, two patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and one patient with diffuse LBD. All 10 cases showed weak cytoplasmic immunostaining within neurons (Figures S5A and S5B) and did not show aggregation as seen in the two ALS cases with CAG expansions (Figures 3 and 4) or in Huntington’s disease patients (Figure S5C). Microscopic examination of the spinal cords of nine patients diagnosed with typical Huntington’s disease did not show spinal motor neuron loss. Our data indicate that pathogenic CAG repeat expansions in HTT can give rise to FTD/ALS syndromes that are clinically distinct from the classical Huntington’s disease syndrome. A careful review of the clinical features of the patients carrying pathogenic HTT expansions confirmed the diagnosis of FTD or ALS in seven out of the eight patients. None of the patients manifested choreoathetoid movements during their illness or reported a family history of Huntington’s disease. Furthermore, the postmortem findings of two of our patients with HTT full-penetrance repeat expansions displayed the classical neuropathologic features of ALS, including loss of motor neurons of the anterior horns and hypoglossal nuclei and the presence of TDP-43-positive inclusions, thereby ruling out mimic syndromes as an explanation of our findings. However, the pathogenic repeat expansions’ effects were corroborated by the occurrence of polyglutamine/huntingtin co-pathology within the frontal lobes. Finally, pathogenic HTT repeat expansions were specific to FTD/ALS cases, as they were not found in a similar-sized cohort of patients diagnosed with LBD. It is possible that the patients carrying a HTT repeat expansion were simply misdiagnosed cases of atypical Huntington’s disease or suffered from two different neurodegenerative diseases by chance, and they would have developed the classic Huntington’s disease symptoms had they lived long enough. We believe that these are unlikely scenarios for several reasons. First, we identified multiple FTD/ALS patients in our discovery cohort following the same clinical pattern and found a similar occurrence rate in our replication cohort. In contrast, full-penetrance pathogenic HTT expansions were not present in our LBD or control whole-genome sequence data. Second, the apparently healthy striatum in both patients who underwent postmortem evaluation diminishes the likelihood of subclinical Huntington’s disease as an explanation for their symptoms. The choreoathetoid movements observed in Huntington’s disease originate from the striatum, and the lack of detectable neuronal loss on general surveys or reactive gliosis in this region of our FTD/ALS patients implies that the motor neuron disease was not masking these symptoms. Third, two of our eight patients lived at least 9 years after symptom onset and did not manifest motor signs of Huntington’s disease during this extended survival period. Fourth, the prevalence rates of FTD (22 per 100,000 population) (Onyike and Diehl-Schmid, 2013Onyike C.U. Diehl-Schmid J. The epidemiology of frontotemporal dementia.Int. Rev. Psychiatry. 2013; 25: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), ALS (6 per 100,000) (Chiò et al., 2013Chiò A. Logroscino G. Traynor B.J. Collins J. Simeone J.C. Goldstein L.A. White L.A.

Wiltshire K. Day L. Dykeman J. Steeves T. Jette N. The incidence and prevalence of Huntington’s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Mov. Disord. 2012; 27: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) indicate that, by chance, there should only be three cases of disease co-occurrence in the entire United States population of 327 million. Instead, we identified eight patients among a moderately sized cohort of FTD/ALS cases (n = 6,116 patients). Finally, the age at onset among our patients overlapped with the predicted age at onset of Huntington’s disease based on their CAG repeat length (Figure 1C). Regardless of the semantic debate as to whether it is correct to designate HTT repeat expansions as a genetic cause of FTD/ALS spectrum disorders, our findings have direct implications for the clinical care of patients presenting with these neurological conditions and the neuropathologic staging of disease.

Their functional synaptic connectivity is largely unknown. Here we studied the membrane properties, synaptic inputs, and sensory responses of these subpopulations in the mouse GPe. We performed <i>in vivo</i> whole-cell recordings in GPe neurons and used optogenetic stimulation to dissect their afferent inputs from the striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Both GPe subpopulations received barrages of excitatory and inhibitory inputs during slow wave activity and responded to sensory stimulation with distinct multiphasic patterns. Prototypic cells synaptically inhibited arkypallidal and prototypic cells. Both GPe subpopulations received synaptic input from STN and striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Although STN and indirect pathway MSNs strongly targeted prototypic cells, direct pathway MSNs selectively inhibited arkypallidal cells. We show that GPe subtypes have distinct connectivity patterns that underlie their respective functional roles."
https://openalex.org/W3110468038,"Transfer across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant hurdle for the development of biopharmaceuticals with therapeutic effects within the central nervous system. We established a functional selection method to identify high affinity single domain antibodies to the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) with efficient biotherapeutic delivery across the BBB. A synthetic phage display library based on the variable domain of new antigen receptor (VNAR) was used for in vitro selection against recombinant human TfR1 ectodomain (rh-TfR1-ECD) followed by in vivo selection in mouse for brain parenchyma penetrating antibodies. TXB2 VNAR was identified as a high affinity, species cross-reactive VNAR antibody against TfR1-ECD that does not compete with transferrin or ferritin for receptor binding. IV dosing of TXB2 when fused to human Fc domain (TXB2-hFc) at 25 nmol/kg (1.875 mg/kg) in mice resulted in rapid binding to brain capillaries with subsequent transport into the brain parenchyma and specific uptake into TfR1-positive neurons. Likewise, IV dosing of TXB2-hFc fused with neurotensin (TXB2-hFc-NT) at 25 nmol/kg resulted in a rapid and reversible pharmacological response as measured by body temperature reduction. TXB2-hFc did not elicit any acute adverse reactions, bind, or deplete circulating reticulocytes or reduce BBB-expressed endogenous TfR1 in mice. There was no evidence of target-mediated clearance or accumulation in peripheral organs except lung. In conclusion, TXB2 is a high affinity, species cross-reactive, and brain-selective VNAR antibody to TfR1 that rapidly crosses the BBB and exhibits a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile and can be readily adapted to carry a wide variety of biotherapeutics from blood to brain."

Serine proteases participate in a wide range of physiological processes, which are regulated by a large family of peptidase inhibitors referred to as serine protease inhibitors (serpins) (Silverman et al., 2001Silverman G.A.

The potential effect of GrB inhibition by Sb9 on both the anti-tumor cellular effectors (such as CL) and immunosuppressive components of the TME is not known (Quail and Joyce, 2013Quail D.F. Joyce J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Aside from the potential for immunomodulation, whether inhibition of Sb9 results in beneficial elimination of tumors either by direct killing or by increased host immunity remains to be determined. In addition to its implications on immune cells and the intrinsic survival of tumor cells, the Sb9-GrB axis can also have a major impact on the tumor stroma as well. Stromal cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), constitute a major cellular component of the diverse TME and play a critical role in tumor development (Kalluri, 2016Kalluri R.

Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Stromal cells can create an optimal milieu by producing numerous growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that promote tumor growth (Nilendu et al., 2018Nilendu P. Sarode S.C. Jahagirdar D.

Here, we show that genetic ablation of Sb9 sensitized tumors to killing by not only CL-derived GrB, but also from endogenously produced GrB, which together resulted in the control of cancer in mice. The role of Sb9 in the anti-tumor host response was examined in Sb9 KO mice, which exhibited increased resistance to tumors. This was a consequence of impaired survival of immunosuppressive TAMs, MDSCs, Tregs, and CAFs in the TME that resulted in increased activity of anti-tumor CL. We developed a specific small molecule inhibitor of Sb9 and showed that treatment of mice could control tumor growth through direct sensitization to GrB and the activation of protective immunity. We examined the expression of Sb9 and GrB in several tumors of human and mouse. Sb9 (Figure 1A) and GrB (Figure 1B) were expressed in primary human and mouse malignant melanoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. We also analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from previous studies (Guo et al., 2018Guo X. Zhang Y. Zheng L. Zheng C. Song J. Zhang Q. Kang B. Liu Z. Jin L.

Sb9 and GrB were detected in these tumor cells, and their expression levels were measured in comparison to tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a positive control (Figure S1A). Additionally, mouse cancer cell lines (B16, mouse melanoma; 4T1, mouse breast cancer; and LLC1, mouse lung cancer) and human cancer cell lines (A375, human melanoma; A549, human lung cancer; and SK-BR3, human breast cancer) also expressed both Sb9 (Figure S1C) and GrB (Figure S1D).

Most GrB+ cells were GFP negative, indicating the presence of tumor-expressed GrB (Figure S1B). Inhibition of GrB by Sb9 via a classic serpin mechanism resulted in an SDS-resistant 62 kDa Sb9-GrB complex in B16 cells (Figures 1C and 1D; Mangan et al., 2016Mangan M.S. Bird C.H. Kaiserman D.

Western blot demonstrated that Sb9 was expressed mainly as a 47 kDa unbound monomer, while a smaller portion of Sb9 formed a 62 kDa Sb9-GrB complex in B16 cells (Figure 1C) (Mangan et al., 2016Mangan M.S.

We observed that almost all of the GrB exists as a 62 kDa complex with Sb9, in contrast to the 26 kDa monomeric GrB found in B16 cells (Figure 1D).

To address the protection of Sb9 from GrB in melanoma cells, we disrupted the SERPINB9 gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We targeted the 20-nucleotide sequence upstream of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in exon 6 of the SERPINB9 gene (Figure S1E). Deletion of Sb9 in the B16 cells was confirmed by western blot (Figure S1F). The complex formation was hampered, suggesting that all GrB in the cell is no longer captured by Sb9. Residual Sb9 protein expression by B16-Sb9 knockout (KO) cells is not an infrequent observation (Figure S1F), due to common tetraploidy in these cells (Kendal et al., 1987Kendal W.S. Wang R.Y.

Methods. 2019; 16: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Sb9 RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining for Sb9 confirmed its lack of expression in B16-Sb9 KO cells (Figures S1G and S1H). However, Sb9 KO did not affect the proliferation of B16 cells, as evidenced by a colony formation assay and the expression of Ki67 gene (Figures S1I and S1J; Li et al., 2015Li L.T. Jiang G. Chen Q. Zheng J.N. Ki67 is a promising molecular target in the diagnosis of cancer (review).Mol. Med. Rep. 2015; 11: 1566-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Sb9 KO resulted in 2-fold increase (p = 0.016) in GrB activity (Figure S1K) and a corresponding 2.3-fold (p = 0.017) increase in GrB-specific apoptosis in B16-Sb9 KO cells compared to B16-wild-type (WT) cells (Figure 1H). Previous studies have reported that interleukin (IL)-2 induces GrB expression in cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and natural killer (NK) CLs (Tamang et al., 2006Tamang D.L. Redelman D. Alves B.N. Vollger L. Bethley C. Hudig D.

We found that the mRNA level of GrB was significantly higher in IL-2-treated B16-WT cells and followed a dose-dependent response (Figure S1L). Additionally, the expression of GrB was also elevated significantly in IL-2-treated B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO cells (Figures 1G and S1O). The cleaved caspase-3 (C-CAS3) expression was higher in B16-Sb9 KO cells compared to B16-WT and increased with IL-2 treatment (Figure S1P). The apoptosis rates (as indicated by the annexin-V+ and viability− population) of B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO cells were significantly higher following treatment with multiple concentrations of IL-2 (Figure 1H), while B16-Sb9 and GrB KO cells showed no IL-2-induced apoptosis (Figure S1M). The GrB inhibitor 368050 also suppressed apoptosis following treatment with IL-2 (Figure S1N). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Sb9 is required to protect tumors from GrB-induced apoptosis. To investigate the role of Sb9 in tumor progression and metastasis in vivo, B16-WT or B16-Sb9 KO cells were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice, then tumor growth was monitored to the size end points. The Sb9-disrupted tumors were ∼4-fold smaller (p = 0.0001) than the B16-WT group at day 27 post-implantation (Figure 2A). The mice reached the size end points at 27 days and 39 days in the B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO, respectively (Figure 2A). We also compared the sizes of B16-Sb9&GrB KO tumors with the B16-WT and B16-Sb9 KO tumors to assess the differential effects of tumor-derived and host-derived GrB in tumor growth. The B16-Sb9&GrB KO tumors grew faster than the B16-Sb9 KO tumors and slower than the B16-WT tumors (Figure S2A). The intermediate protection seen in B16-Sb9&GrB KO mice could be due to exposure to host-derived GrB. No difference was noted in the size of B16-Sb9 KO tumors derived from a single clone or those from a bulk cell population (Figure S2B). Staining of the melanoma sections with the melanoma marker MelanA at day 17 following implantation revealed a much smaller MelanA+ area in the B16-Sb9 KO group than the B16-WT group (Figures 2B and 2C). The median survival time (MST) of mice bearing B16-Sb9 KO tumors was significantly longer (p < 0.0001) than that of mice bearing B16-WT tumors (Figure S2C). B16-Sb9 KO tu"

Scott et al. used long-term data collected during translocations of Mojave Desert tortoises, including animals formerly kept as pets, to test these questions. Although the overall rates of survival for all tortoises at the site (both reintroduced and native) were extremely low, translocated individuals with the highest heterozygosity survived at much higher rates than those determined to be similar to the target population.

As few transcriptional changes underlie this transition, we used single-cell and bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) on human HSCs and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) subsets to uncover chromatin accessibility signatures, one including LT-HSCs (LT/HSPC signature) and another excluding LT-HSCs (activated HSPC [Act/HSPC] signature). These signatures inversely correlated during early hematopoietic commitment and differentiation. The Act/HSPC signature contains CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites mediating 351 chromatin interactions engaged in ST-HSCs, but not LT-HSCs, enclosing multiple stemness pathway genes active in LT-HSCs and repressed in ST-HSCs. CTCF silencing derepressed stemness genes, restraining quiescent LT-HSCs from transitioning to activated ST-HSCs. Hence, 3D chromatin interactions centrally mediated by CTCF endow a gatekeeper function that governs the earliest fate transitions HSCs make by coordinating disparate stemness pathways linked to quiescence and self-renewal."

https://openalex.org/W3107895271,"Many-body physics describes phenomena which cannot be understood looking at a systems' constituents alone. Striking manifestations are broken symmetry, phase transitions, and collective excitations. Understanding how such collective behaviour emerges when assembling a system from individual particles has been a vision in atomic, nuclear, and solid-state physics for decades. Here, we observe the few-body precursor of a quantum phase transition from a normal to a superfluid phase. The transition is signalled by the softening of the mode associated with amplitude vibrations of the order parameter, commonly referred to as a Higgs mode. We achieve exquisite control over ultracold fermions confined to two-dimensional harmonic potentials and prepare closed-shell configurations of 2, 6 and 12 fermionic atoms in the ground state with high fidelity. Spectroscopy is then performed on our mesoscopic system while tuning the pair energy from zero to being larger than the shell spacing. Using full atom counting statistics, we find the lowest resonance to consist of coherently excited pairs only. The distinct non-monotonic interaction dependence of this many-body excitation as well as comparison with numerical calculations allows us to identify it as the precursor of the Higgs mode. Our atomic simulator opens new pathways to systematically unravel the emergence of collective phenomena and the thermodynamic limit particle by particle."

https://openalex.org/W3088198383,"Sea-level rise due to ice loss in the Northern Hemisphere in response to insolation and greenhouse gas forcing is thought to have caused grounding-line retreat of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS)1–3. Such interhemispheric sea-level forcing may explain the synchronous evolution of global ice sheets over ice-age cycles. Recent studies that indicate that the AIS experienced substantial millennial-scale variability during and after the last deglaciation4–7 (roughly 20,000 to 9,000 years ago) provide further evidence of this sea-level forcing. However, global sea-level change as a result of mass loss from ice sheets is strongly nonuniform, owing to gravitational, deformational and Earth rotational effects8, suggesting that the response of AIS grounding lines to Northern Hemisphere sea-level forcing is more complicated than previously modelled1,2,6. Here, using an ice-sheet model coupled to a global sea-level model, we show that AIS dynamics are amplified by Northern Hemisphere sea-level forcing. As a result of this interhemispheric interaction, a large or rapid Northern Hemisphere sea-level forcing enhances grounding-line advance and associated mass gain of the AIS during glaciation, and grounding-line retreat and mass loss during deglaciation. Relative to models without these interactions, the inclusion of Northern Hemisphere sea-level forcing in our model increases the volume of the AIS during the Last Glacial Maximum (about 26,000 to 20,000 years ago), triggers an earlier retreat of the grounding line and leads to millennial-scale variability throughout the last deglaciation. These findings are consistent with geologic reconstructions of the extent of the AIS during the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent ice-sheet retreat, and with relative sea-level change in Antarctica3–7,9,10. Changes in Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet size during ice-age cycles enhance the advance and retreat of the grounding line of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, owing to interhemispheric sea-level forcing."

https://openalex.org/W3109743556,"Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) is a bicomponent leukotoxin produced by 3%-10% of clinical Staphylococcus aureus (SA) strains involved in the severity of hospital and community-acquired infections. Although PVL was long known as a pore-forming toxin, recent studies have challenged the formation of a pore at the plasma membrane, while its endocytosis and the exact mode of action remain to be defined. In vitro immunolabeling of human neutrophils shows that Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETosis) is triggered by the action of purified PVL, but not by Gamma hemolysin CB (HlgCB), a structurally similar SA leukotoxin. PVL causes the ejection of chromatin fibers (NETs) decorated with antibacterial peptides independently of the NADPH oxidase oxidative burst. Leukotoxin partially colocalizes with mitochondria and enhances the production of reactive oxygen species from these organelles, while showing an increased autophagy, which results unnecessary for NETs ejection. PVL NETosis is elicited through Ca2+-activated SK channels and Myeloperoxidase activity but is abolished by Allopurinol pretreatment of neutrophils. Moreover, massive citrullination of the histone H3 is performed by peptidyl arginine deiminases. Inhibition of this latter enzymes fails to abolish NET extrusion. Unexpectedly, PVL NETosis does not seem to involve Src kinases, which is the main kinase family activated downstream the binding of PVL F subunit to CD45 receptor, while the specific kinase pathway differs from the NADPH oxidase-dependent NETosis. PVL alone causes a different and specific form of NETosis that may rather represent a bacterial strategy conceived to disarm and disrupt the immune response, eventually allowing SA to spread."

https://openalex.org/W3107375003,"Mutations in any of the genes encoding the four subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a mitochondrial membrane-bound enzyme complex that is involved in both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport chain, can lead to a variety of disorders. Recognized conditions with such mutations include Leigh syndrome and hereditary tumors such as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), renal cell carcinoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Tumors appear in SDH mutation carriers with dominant inheritance due to loss of heterozygosity in susceptible cells. Here, we describe a mouse model intended to reproduce hereditary PPGL through Cre-mediated loss of SDHC in cells that express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a compartment where PPGL is known to originate. We report that while there is modest expansion of TH+ glomus cells in the carotid body upon SDHC loss, PPGL is not observed in such mice, even in the presence of a conditional dominant negative p53 protein and chronic hypoxia. Instead, we report an unexpected phenotype of nondiabetic obesity beginning at about 20 weeks of age. We hypothesize that this obesity is caused by TH+ cell loss or altered phenotype in key compartments of the central nervous system responsible for regulating feeding behavior, coupled with metabolic changes due to loss of peripheral catecholamine production."

Does this approach link to concerns of the humanities meaningfully? We outline prospects of developing a genuine neurohumanities research program. The brain basis of language, music, and emotion can be studied from the perspective of the psychological and cognitive sciences. Does this approach link to concerns of the humanities meaningfully? We outline prospects of developing a genuine neurohumanities research program. Some experiences are quintessentially human—and are sometimes considered the defining features of being human: the faculty of language, the capability to make or enjoy music, and the experience of emotion. These ubiquitous aspects of human nature are especially tough challenges for artificial systems to capture and simulate, their computational power notwithstanding. (It will be a long, long time before an artificial system “listens” to Kool and the Gang and Messiaen and outputs “wow, both of those pieces gave me goosebumps.”) For more than 2000 years, questions about these domains have been at the core of humanistic inquiry. Many theories (from the eminently plausible to the certifiably insane) have been proposed to account for the origin and nature of these fundamental experiences. With the emergence of neurobiological research in the late 19th century, and the explosion of new approaches in the last 50 years, these topics have been studied with the range of methodologies now available to human neuroscience. But with few exceptions, humanities and neuroscience research have proceeded in parallel, with few points of connection that have yielded major insights. In part the reasons are sociological (scholars in the different intellectual traditions are deeply suspicious of one another), in part methodological (say a close reading of a text versus a high-resolution scan of a synapse), and in part logical (what could the relationship between the relevant concepts from humanities and sciences actually be?). The different cultures and intellectual traditions continue their work in isolation, but the yearning to find accounts of how these fundamental aspects of human experience arise from neural processes is present and increasing. What would a productive neurohumanities research program look like? In the best of all possible worlds, one should learn both something about the domain in question (i.e., language, music, emotion, history, morality, art, etc.) and something principled about neurobiology. The best cognitive neuroscience research manages to illuminate brain organization and function and can adjudicate between interesting theoretical alternatives within a cognitive domain (for review, see Poeppel et al., 2020Poeppel D. Mangun G.R. Gazzaniga M.S. The Cognitive Neurosciences. MIT Press, 2020Google Scholar). A second-best (and still excellent) outcome would be interdisciplinary work that succeeds in making a substantive contribution to neuroscientific questions or to issues raised by the humanistic research. There are such examples: the interdisciplinary field of neuroeconomics, leveraging formalisms from behavioral economics, has yielded important insights into the neural computations underlying evaluations and decisions (Glimcher and Rustichini, 2004Glimcher P.W. Rustichini A. Neuroeconomics: the consilience of brain and decision.Science. 2004; 306: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). A third and decidedly undesirable outcome—and this may be the modal situation—is interdisciplinary cross-sterilization. Rather than synergistic interaction between the questions, methods, and theories at stake, the research succeeds in yielding nothing of consequence to either discipline, or at best, produces descriptively acceptable datasets. So how to proceed? We outline three ideas that in our view merit careful consideration, if the endgame is to stimulate principled research at the intersection of the humanities and neuroscience. How we use language—across contexts ranging from the banal (“pass the salt”) to the exalted (“I thought that love would last forever, I was wrong”) —is an area of inquiry that has been at the center of the humanities. However, not all of language studies are particularly useful when linking to neuroscience. Research that aims to understand how language is represented and computed in the brain has a long history, and there has been remarkable progress (Hagoort, 2019Hagoort P. Human language: From genes and brains to behavior. MIT Press, 2019Google Scholar). That being said, the aspect of language research that has formed the basis for neurobiological studies builds on questions and techniques from computational and psycholinguistics, not questions that arise in a humanities context. The standard research program on brain and language—one which we endorse and which underpins our own work—addresses relatively low-level questions, ranging from topics in speech perception (e.g., how are syllables processed) to word recognition (e.g., where are lexical items stored) to sentence comprehension (e.g., when are syntactic operations executed). These topics can be addressed in a theoretically principled, computationally explicit, and methodologically thorough manner. Broadly speaking, the aim can be characterized as a search for brain mechanisms that make language processing possible. In practice, based on research in linguistics, cognitive science, and psychology, we construct “parts lists” of linguistic primitives (e.g., feature, morpheme, verb phrase, concatenation, etc.) and try to identify linking hypotheses to neurobiological primitives that result from neuroscientific research (e.g., dendrite, cortical column, oscillation, etc.) (Embick and Poeppel, 2015Embick D. Poeppel D. Towards a computational(ist) neurobiology of language: Correlational, integrated, and explanatory neurolinguistics.Lang. Cogn. Neurosci. 2015; 30: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A similarly reductionist research agenda has also been productive in the study of emotion and music. Within affective neuroscience, extensive cross-species research methodically quantifying and manipulating overt emotion-related behaviors (e.g., freezing in rodents) has yielded a detailed model of the neural circuitry underlying the expression of defensive emotional responses. A growing body of research in music cognition has also connected in important ways with neuroanatomy (e.g., are there cortical regions specialized for music) and neurophysiology (e.g., does auditory cortex entrain to beats). The goals typically include questions of this form: how is musical pitch encoded? What are the cerebral structures underlying rhythm perception? Are there differences between musicians and non-musicians in processing harmonic prediction? If we take the (relatively narrow, well-delineated, and actionable) perspective that language, music, and emotion are inherently “concepts of the humanities” that can be explored in productive ways from the vantage points of psychology, computation, neuroscience, then we are basically done! Neurohumanities research is then simply research on concepts traditionally associated with the humanities that are now investigated using the perspectives and methods of these scientific disciplines. Although our own research is relentlessly reductionist and “decompositional” in its approach, and as such, very much in the tradition of the standard research program we outline above, we contend that this is not the type of research agenda that can address the central concerns of a humanities-inspired research program. There is a mismatch in the granularity of the phenomena and concerns. To be sure, a formal analysis of meter in a poem or the goal to capture the “prose rhythm” of a particular writer can closely relate to what psychology and linguistics typically explore. However, the aspects of language that the humanities seek to characterize, in our view, go beyond the pursuits of linguistics, cognitive science, computation, and psychology. Likewise, in the case of emotion, can research programs drawing from studies of animal behavior and physiology lead to models of emotion that connect in a satisfying way to humanistic inquiry into the subjective experience of emotion (LeDoux and Hofmann, 2018LeDoux J.E. Hofmann S.G. The subjective experience of emotion: a fearful view.Curr. Opin. Behav. Sci. 2018; 19: 67-72Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar)? The question we ask ourselves is whether we can expect that by scaling up a research program focused on the neurobiology of simple psychological phenomena, we might eventually reach an understanding of humanistic experience. That is to say, will models of Gabor patch perception ultimately link to and illuminate the appreciation of the subtlety of a complex novel one is reading? Will our understanding of a simple acoustic stimulus scale up to the understanding of word recognition? And will that scale up to an understanding of sentences in a discourse? And—here is a huge step—does that in turn connect to an experience of identification and rapture in reading a Ferrante novel? The standard reductionist research agenda presupposes that studying simpler, smaller things can in some cases ultimately lead to a satisfactory understanding and explanation of complex phenomena. But we have no reason to believe that this is correct, as it’s certainly not true in other domains of the sciences (Anderson, 1972Anderson P.W. More is different.Science. 1972; 177: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). If the formal characterization of the experience will not scale up from the stimulus, a successful neurohumanities research program cannot simply build on experiments from cognitive science and experimental psychology; rather, it must embrace the conceptual infrastructure of the humanities disciplines themselves. If the endgame is to develop a comprehensive understanding of these complex and subtle domains, we must consider the possibility that new insight can be gained by looking toward conceptualizations that the humanities make available and that we ignore at our peril. We suggest that the goal of a neurohumanities research program that genuinely builds on the principles of both intellectual traditions is roughly as follows: The humanities approaches to language, music, or emotion illuminate the rich subjective experiences that depend on properties of the individual, considerations of identity, and cultural context. As a consequence, the research might aim to discover the neural principles that govern the construction of the subjective experience elicited by the natural socio-cultural stimuli that comprise the experience of language, music, and emotion. A neurohumanities research program must negotiate between the desideratum to find regularity—a fundamental attribute of scientific inquiry—and the incorporation of individual experience into explanatory frameworks. There is currently tremendous enthusiasm in the field for using naturalistic materials in cognitive neuroscience experimentation. There has been a considerable amount of research using movies or music, pairing such audiovisual materials with techniques such as functional MRI, patient-based electrocorticography, electroencephalography, etc. (e.g., Baldassano et al., 2017Baldassano C. Chen J. Zadbood A. Pillow J.W. Hasson U. Norman K.A. Discovering event structure in continuous narrative perception and memory.Neuron. 2017; 95: 709-721.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar; Salimpoor et al., 2013Salimpoor V.N. van den Bosch I. Kovacevic N. McIntosh A.R. Dagher A. Zatorre R.J. Interactions between the nucleus accumbens and auditory cortices predict music reward value.Science. 2013; 340: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). There is also a growing body of work using real narratives, on the view that these types of materials capture ecologically valid experience more faithfully (Willems et al., 2020Willems R.M. Nastase S.A. Milivojevic B. Narratives for Neuroscience.Trends Neurosci. 2020; 43: 271-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Will it suffice to proceed with the existing research logic by simply using more complex, naturalistic stimuli? Does measuring the brain responses elicited by such materials provide a natural connection to the humanities by virtue of the materials themselves? In our view, this research is to be lauded for the richness of the stimuli, their evocative properties, and the idiosyncratic personal experience elicited in each listener or viewer. These features of naturalistic stimuli may be necessary in any attempt to link to the concerns of humanities-inspired research. It is undoubtedly a reasonable conjecture that these types of materials yield experiences that are closer to the types of concerns of the humanities in light of such intrinsic properties. That said, now the links to the neurobiological questions are extremely difficult to establish. It is not easy to obtain insight into the biological principles that underlie complex individual experience by looking at the response of virtually the entire brain to such complex materials. The extraordinarily complicated and extensive pattern of neural responses that are generated by, say, several minutes of an emotionally powerful symphony or a film, are very difficult indeed to parse into constituent operations that allow us to interpret the biology in a more principled and mechanistic manner. To be sure, we are—perhaps naively—optimistic that mechanistic progress can be made by studying experimental participants during increasingly natural experiences (Baldassano et al., 2017Baldassano C. Chen J. Zadbood A. Pillow J.W. Hasson U. Norman K.A. Discovering event structure in continuous narrative perception and memory.Neuron. 2017; 95: 709-721.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar; Heller et al., 2020Heller A.S. Shi T.C. Ezie C.E.C. Reneau T.R. Baez L.M. Gibbons C.J. Hartley C.A. Association between real-world experiential diversity and positive affect relates to hippocampal-striatal functional connectivity.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The challenge is to find a balance between the naturalism of the experimental materials and the careful control that permits precise biological interpretation. This is possible, but it requires very thorough characterization of the materials at many levels and very well-developed predictions about how stimulus attributes interact with the brain—without giving in to reductionist predilections. The major challenge is to formulate linking hypotheses that provide a conceptual substrate on the basis of which to design new experiments at the humanities-neuroscience interface. But this is a very deep and difficult problem. How, for example, are we to conceive of the link between the “stuff of thought” (such as “transitive verb” or “harmonic progression” or “feeling of achievement”) and the “stuff of the brain” (like “dendritic spine” or “cortical oscillation”)? The basic concepts, or primitives, are ontologically incommensurable. One critical, intermediate step to a vibrant neurohumanities, therefore, will be the development of linking hypotheses that are equally well motivated from a humanistic perspective and tractable with neurobiological methodology. Because this problem is rather significant even when one looks at well-defined, cognitive science research (i.e., we don’t have an understanding of the experience of joy, so why would it be easy to have an understanding of the experience of rapture in the reading of a book?), the development of linking hypotheses between humanities-based concepts and neuroscience-based ones is even more charged with complexity. What would a serious neurohumanities research program in these domains look like, one that is intellectually sensitive to key concepts of the humanities while simultaneously providing experimental agendas that are actionable given what we know about human neuroscience? We submit that the novel, to-be-developed linking hypotheses embrace the serious study of subjective experience. This must include the study of systematic ways in which subjective experience is influenced by prior knowledge. In the end, the work should seek to provide an account of the biological embedding of an individual’s context and culture. And to make this valuable from the perspective of human neuroscience, the data obtained from experimentation should be more than just another measurement made in response to some stimulus. There should be the ambition to understand the organization of the brain and exactly how it gives rise to rich naturalistic experience. Current progress on the brain basis of language, music, and emotion is exciting and spurs legitimate optimism, but one must bear in mind clear limitations: the insights remain by-and-large correlational, not explanatory. The relation between neuroscience and these three deeply human experiences are increasingly well characterized. The spatial resolution of the imaging methods and the temporal resolution of the recording methods allow ever greater descriptive characterization. However, we still lack the appropriate “conceptual resolution” to develop in a comprehensive, mechanistic, and explanatory fashion how these domains of rich individual experience are implemented in a brain."
https://openalex.org/W3109882894,"Abstract Leukemias are routinely sub-typed for risk/outcome prediction and therapy choice using acquired mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. Down syndrome acute lymphoblastic leukemia (DS‐ALL) is characterized by high frequency of CRLF2 ‐rearrangements, JAK2 ‐mutations, or RAS‐pathway mutations. Intriguingly, JAK2 and RAS -mutations are mutually exclusive in leukemic sub‐clones, causing dichotomy in therapeutic target choices. We prove in a cell model that elevated CRLF2 in combination with constitutionally active JAK2 is sufficient to activate wtRAS. On primary clinical DS‐ALL samples, we show that wtRAS-activation is an obligatory consequence of mutated/hyperphosphorylated JAK2. We further prove that CRLF2-ligand TSLP boosts the direct binding of active PTPN11 to wtRAS, providing the molecular mechanism for the wtRAS activation. Pre‐inhibition of RAS or PTPN11, but not of PI3K or JAK‐signaling, prevented TSLP‐induced RAS‐GTP boost. Cytotoxicity assays on primary clinical DS‐ALL samples demonstrated that, regardless of mutation status, high-risk leukemic cells could only be killed using RAS‐inhibitor or PTPN11-inhibitor, but not PI3K/JAK‐inhibitors, suggesting a unified treatment target for up to 80% of DS‐ALL. Importantly, protein activities-based principal-component-analysis multivariate clusters analyzed for independent outcome prediction using Cox proportional-hazards model showed that protein‐activity (but not mutation-status) was independently predictive of outcome, demanding a paradigm-shift in patient‐stratification strategy for precision therapy in high-risk ALL."

As a guide, we suggest three features of meaningful progress in the collaborative field, the neurohumanities, which we illustrate through a discussion of “neural schemas.” Given the brain’s central role in interactions with the external world, neuroscience is uniquely positioned for scholarly engagement across disciplines. Despite the field’s embrace of multidisciplinarity, recent expansions in neuroscience have occurred primarily through implementation of exciting new technologies, innovative engineering methods, and advances in computational analyses. Far fewer advances been made through fresh intellectual engagement with the diverse and complex issues central to human experience. Here, we argue that the time is right for a closer partnership between specific domains of neuroscience and their counterparts within the humanities, which we define broadly as all aspects of human society and culture, including, language, literature, philosophy, law, politics, religion, art, history, and social psychology. For the humanities, such partnerships can provide potentially richer and deeper insights into how minds create, engage with, and respond to experience. But of equal importance, it would expand the purview of neuroscience beyond the range of well-defined phenomena whose precise mechanisms are currently amenable to reductionist approaches. In addition to the opportunities such partnerships represent for new creative research, we suggest that neuroscience also has a pressing responsibility to engage with the canvas of human experience and problems of critical importance to today’s society, as well as for communicating with a clear objective voice to diverse audiences across professional, cultural, and national boundaries. There are several potential barriers to the broadened partnership we encourage. From some neuroscientists, there is skepticism for working on “soft” questions with methods that cannot provide insights of sufficient mechanistic depth and precision, perhaps in part because of a paucity of accepted animal models that permit exploring this broader landscape. In the humanities, there is also some pushback against the neuro-turn (a hyphenated “neuro” prefix placed before art, literature, law, economics, theology, philosophy, feminism, etc.), in particular against the confident tone of preliminary neuroscientific studies of artistic, literary, or cultural phenomena, which arguably provide ornamentation more than actionable, decisive, or transformative insight (Dumit, 2015Dumit J. The Fragile Unity of Neuroscience.in: Pluth D.E. Neuroscience & Critique: Exploring the limits of the neurological turn J. Routledge, NY2015Google Scholar). Overcoming these barriers and criticisms requires an appreciation of current limitations in both domains and, significantly, a healthy dose of mutual respect. However, it is equally important to agree on features that would indeed represent real collaborative progress in the neurohumanities. We suggest that genuine progress in the development of the hybrid field of neurohumanities would be reflected by the three primary characteristics that we describe below (see Figure 1), each of which is illustrated through examples discussed in this volume (Dudai, 2020Dudai Y. In Search of the Cultural Engram.Neuron. 2020; 108 (this issue): 600-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar; Hartley and Poeppel, 2020Hartley C. Poeppel D.

Can Neuroscience Change the Way we View Morality?.Neuron. 2020; 108 (this issue): 604-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Increased discourse and communication across disciplines is critical. One mechanism for increased communication would be to map the terminology or concepts in one discipline onto the other, for instance, in linguistics and music, as discussed in the accompanying article by Hartley and Poeppel (Hartley and Poeppel, 2020Hartley C. Poeppel D. Beyond the Stimulus: A Neurohumanities Approach to Language, Music, and Emotion.Neuron. 2020; 108 (this issue): 597-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). A parallel strategy would be to agree on specific neural parameters as objective, quantitative measures of complex, qualitative concepts. An example might be to build on innovative paradigms from neuroscience in which neural signals can be derived, not from structured and controlled laboratory contexts, but from naturally unfolding stimuli—e.g., fast electroencephalographic evoked responses during attentional engagement to carefully chosen film segments or comprehension of selected written/spoken passages of text. For the arts and humanities, the availability of such objective neural measures would enable new, experimental approaches to literature and the arts, potentially leading to more effective compositional techniques for prose and theater. Simultaneously, by responding to challenges entailed in convincingly mapping noisy brain signals onto the nuances, complexities, and range of real-life human experiences, such a partnership could lead to deeper and richer neuroscience. An additional goal of the neurohumanities should be to clearly connect biological processes in individual brains to phenomena of interest to the humanities. One example is the discovery of hippocampal or cortical replay as a potential basis for planning and evaluating future courses of action. Another could be elucidating the relevance of orthogonal memory storage mechanisms for the contextual memory recall that underlies individual and group decisions. Yet another is the development of studies that potentially dissociate two systems for empathy in the brain, emotional (“I feel what you feel”) and cognitive (“I understand what you feel”), to examine how different empathic responses may be generated by art, prose, or discourse. Projects that connect hypothesis-based laboratory studies to real-life human experiences studied by a broader scholarly community may eventually provide mechanistic frameworks for a deeper understanding of social behavior. Meaningful progress should stimulate new actions. It could drive experimental tests of theories, stimulate implementation of new methodologies, or significantly influence policy. A prominent successful example is the influence on judicial treatment of eye-witness testimony of recent insights into how memories are significantly reconstructed and modified during recall. Another example is the effect that has been exerted on medical ethics and policy by technologies enabling monitoring and interpretation of brain responses of comatose patients to sensory stimuli. Scholarly work that could be included under the heading neurohumanities is already represented in several forms at a variety of academic and research institutions around the globe. A growing number of institutions, including Caltech, the Max Planck Institute, Columbia University, UC Santa Barbara, NYU, and Trinity College Dublin, have, in recent years, created structures that bring together multiple aspects of the neurohumanities. That said, perhaps because research in this area is rarely integrated and organized under a single umbrella, a large segment of both the neuroscience and the humanities/arts communities around the world do not yet appreciate the potential of this emerging field, the power it can bring to interdisciplinary inquiry, and the opportunities it offers for new understanding. To provide a sense of the insights and issues that intersect throughout this series of NeuroViews, in the following paragraphs, we will briefly highlight some of the key elements in each of the essays to follow. In their essay, Iigaya, O’Doherty, and Starr address the issue of neural mechanisms that endow us all with the capacity to make aesthetic judgments (Iigaya et al., 2020Iigaya K. O’Doherty J.P. Starr G.G. Progress and promise in neuroaesthetics.Neuron. 2020; 108 (this issue): 594-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Outlining recent attempts to build a framework for the aesthetic experience starting from visual input, they make the case that human aesthetic experiences engage neural circuits known to be involved in reward processing. They raise the fundamental question of why some experiences are assigned high aesthetic value while other experiences are not and suggest that a combination of neuroimaging and computational approaches offer promising paths of inquiry to address this deep problem. Noting that the “aesthetic experience” is likely to be a non-unitary multidimensional process, they further discuss how different forms of such an experience might engage differential neural systems. They conclude by emphasizing how and why progress in understanding the field of neuroaesthetics requires active collaboration between neuroscientists and colleagues in the arts and humanities. The next NeuroView considers both the promises and pitfalls of a neurohumanities approach in the exploration of language, music, and emotion (Hartley and Poeppel, 2020Hartley C. Poeppel D. Beyond the Stimulus: A Neurohumanities Approach to Language, Music, and Emotion.Neuron. 2020; 108 (this issue): 597-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). They propose that, although these three areas of inquiry have traditionally been the province of the humanities, with the remarkable technical and conceptual advance of neuroscientific inquiry, these fundamental areas are now also available to modern human neuroscience. The authors provide clear examples of promising advances at the intersection of neuroscientific and humanistic exploration of these three areas of study. They argue that progress in theoretical, computational, neuroimaging, and psychological experimental approaches have allowed linguistics, music, and emotion to become key components of modern cognitive neuroscience. But the authors also add an important cautionary note about the current limitations of these approaches because they remain “largely correlational, but not explanatory.” Thus, Hartley and Poeppel emphasize the need for greater “conceptual resolution” to provide a platform for comprehensive, mechanistic explanations of these critical domains of human experience. The third NeuroView addresses the critical issue of memory, placing it in the broad context of cultural memory, that is, memories that are accumulated across individuals and generations (Dudai, 2020Dudai Y. In Search of the Cultural Engram.Neuron. 2020; 108 (this issue): 600-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Dudai argues that human cultures can store distributed representations of behaviorally relevant experiences over broad expanses of time (on the scale of centuries and millennia), thereby providing an extraordinary expansion of the notion of an “engram,” typically thought of as the memory of events experienced by a single individual. This broad and creative view permits the very concept of memory as an “encoded experience” to overcome the limited lifespan of an individual or a generation of individuals. Dudai argues that considering cultural memory in this fashion broadens the conceptual reach of the general field of memory by seeking to identify mechanisms that permit the transmission of memory across such a vast temporal expanse. In his review, he suggests several imaginative paradigms to explore this type of memory, which he proposes is transmitted by considering human cultures as “biocultural superorganisms.” He ends his review by discussing the critical point that the search for the cultural engram, as he proposes it, provides a clear example of a critical area of inquiry that is best advanced by scholarly partnerships between neurosciences and the humanities. In the final NeuroView, Kelly and O’Connell highlight how neuroscience is positioned at the forefront of a “new science of morality” that seeks to uncover the origins of our unique capacity for making decisions about complex concepts such as rights, justice, and duty (Kelly and O’Connell, 2020Kelly C. O’Connell R. Can Neuroscience Change the Way we View Morality?.Neuron. 2020; 108 (this issue): 604-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). They point out that this nascent discipline departs from the general question posed by traditional philosophical discourse, leaving aside questions about what we “should” do to examine what humans “actually” do when making a moral decision. The authors outline studies that have revealed considerable overlap in the neural circuitry supporting moral and non-moral decisions, suggesting that human morality does not arise from a single specialized neural module but from an array of domain-general perceptual, cognitive, and socioemotional processes. They also highlight how the adoption of modern neuroscientific methods is making it possible to parse and measure the appraisal dimensions and computations that inform our moral choices and thus to test and refine theoretical models—some of which build directly on progress in philosophy. Finally, they argue that, in order for neuroscience to connect with the kinds of moral decisions we face in everyday life, the field should strive to implement more naturalistic paradigms and to address the pivotal role that identity, stories, and context play in our moral development. To highlight the point that the chosen topics in this series represent but a small cross section of possible areas for the neurohumanities, we here describe another example of how our own research area, the neuronal mechanisms of memory, could be expanded to address a pressing issue for the humanities today, namely the fragmentation of society into siloes of subcultures. We suggest that broad use of the term and concept of “neural schemas” will enhance communication, helping to bring neuroscientists, social psychologists, and philosophers of mind together to address the fundamental and contemporary problem of social polarization in ways that also advance these respective disciplines. Neuroscientists appreciate that reductionist approaches used to decipher molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms of learning and memory can only inadequately address the nuances of human memory. The gap is in part due to the obvious difficulty in modeling the complexity of human memory tasks, but more fundamentally, it is because investigations of experimentally naive animals ignore the fact that perception, learning, memory, and behavior are enormously influenced by prior knowledge (Tse et al., 2007Tse D. Langston R.F. Kakeyama M. Bethus I. Spooner P.A. Wood E.R. Witter M.P. Morris R.G. Schemas and memory consolidation.Science. 2007; 316: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). This is critical because a key element of cognitive development is the creation and deployment of schemas (neurally encoded frameworks that organize knowledge according to contexts, categories, and rules that enhance the efficiency of new learning). Memory schemas account for the increased ability of an experienced student to comprehend new scientific information or the relative ease with which an expert musician can learn to play a new instrument. Although the engagement of memory schemas facilitates encoding of schema-congruent information, at the same time, by facilitating selective perception and recall of schema-consistent information, it can result in incomplete and inaccurate models of the world (Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017Gilboa A. Marlatte H. Neurobiology of Schemas and Schema-Mediated Memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2017; 21: 618-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although for most tasks, efficiency more than makes up for inaccuracy, this may not be true in contemporary social interactions. Over the course of a lifetime, schemas created through personal, social, and cultural experience (memories gained largely through narrative) create strong expectations of the world to which an individual belongs (Bartlett, 1932Bartlett F.C. Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Cambridge University Press, 1932Google Scholar). These high-level schemas may therefore underlie our sense of individual identity. In relatively homogeneous societies, shared cultural schemas may be beneficial, but in heterogenous groups, the same higher-level schemas may lead to phenomena such as ingroup-outgroup recognition, threat perception, and conflicts that fuel many of today’s societal tensions (Mitchell et al., 2006Mitchell J.P. Macrae C.N. Banaji M.R. Dissociable medial prefrontal contributions to judgments of similar and dissimilar others.Neuron. 2006; 50: 655-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Thus, studies of how schema are encoded, regulated, and modified, as well as ways in which schemas result in selective perception and learning, represent a major frontier in neuroscience with clear conceptual connectivity to the humanities. The concept of schematic knowledge has recently begun to be investigated via the use of tools and approaches of cognitive and systems neuroscience, yielding several highly interesting insights. Higher-level schema, including those associated with cultural memories, appear to involve subregions of the prefrontal cortex (Gagnepain et al., 2020Gagnepain P. Vallee T. Heiden S. Decorde M. Gauvain J.L. Laurent A. Klein-Peschanski C. Viader F. Peschanski D. Eustache F. Collective memory shapes the organization of individual memories in the medial prefrontal cortex.Nat. Hum. Behav. 2020; 4: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar; Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017Gilboa A. Marlatte H. Neurobiology of Schemas and Schema-Mediated Memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2017; 21: 618-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In support of this view, fMRI signals in these regions report schema activation, and localized lesions in these regions, while impairing schematic generalization, also remarkably improve accurate recall of detail (Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017Gilboa A. Marlatte H. Neurobiology of Schemas and Schema-Mediated Memory.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2017; 21: 618-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is most likely significant that these brain regions are also activated during higher-level functions including aesthetics, morality, value judgement, decision making, narrative comprehension, and ingroup-outgroup responses, each of which are strongly influenced by frameworks of prior cultural knowledge. More provocative observations suggest that schema activation can be regulated, for example by context or attention, pointing to the existence of neural pathways that may suppress schema activation and, by enhancing prediction error signals in the hippocampus, facilitate new learning of schema-dissonant information as well as their subsequent assimilation into broadened schemas (Liu et al., 2019Liu Y. Dolan R.J. Kurth-Nelson Z. Behrens T.E.J. Human Replay Spontaneously Reorganizes Experience.Cell. 2019; 178: 640-652.e14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; van Kesteren et al., 2012van Kesteren M.T. Ruiter D.J. Fernandez G. Henson R.N. How schema and novelty augment memory formation.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 211-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These pioneering studies of schema could lead to many actionable outcomes. First, they could advance research addressing unanswered questions with respect to the neuroscience of schematic memory. How are rules and categories extracted from multiple experiences and represented in higher levels of the cortex (Liu et al., 2019Liu Y. Dolan R.J. Kurth-Nelson Z. Behrens T.E.J. Human Replay Spontaneously Reorganizes Experience.Cell. 2019; 178: 640-652.e14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)? What is the mechanism by which schema activation filters new information? How can schema activation be regulated volitionally or through context in order to support learning of novel (schema incongruent) information? When appropriately contextualized, answers to these fundamental questions will have direct relevance to cultural and situational elements of literature, art, music, and multiple other fields of the arts and humanities. Second, transdisciplinary studies of schema could result in changes to social practices and policy. Understanding how schema activation may be regulated by emotional or social contexts could facilitate the development of new educational, clinical, and discursive practices to reduce “schema overreliance” and allow assimilation of novel viewpoints. Moreover, by elaborating common biological mechanisms that underlie the sense of human identity, neurohumanities has the opportunity to provide a measured and shared scientific language to explain our differences, equally relevant to different identities and points of view, and in doing so, plays an important hand in guiding policies that help create more connected societies. In our brief remarks above, we emphasize the need to forge closer partnerships between specific domains of neuroscience and their counterparts within the humanities. We advance the argument that such partnerships will not only be mutually beneficial but also create a new dimension of important and impactful scholarly activity. The growth of this field requires expanding the perspective within each broad discipline, for instance increased cross talk between neuroscientists working on human and (non-human) animal behavior, as well as support from academics, funding agencies, leading journals, and other stakeholders for early foundational work whose impact has yet to be fully demonstrated. We hope that this NeuroView series will provide strong support and clear justification for the importance and promise of this emerging field. We acknowledge key support for development of the neurohumanities from a Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund award to Trinity College Dublin. We thank the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and Trinity Long Room Hub for facilitating formative conversations and many colleagues, including Richard Morris, Asaf Gilboa, Marlieke van Kesteren, Paul Dockree, and Ian Robertson, for useful discussion."

During my 7-month internship, my colleagues in the lab told me I would be an author when they wrote up the work. A few months ago, I was shocked to learn that the resulting paper had already been accepted for publication—and that my contribution had been relegated to the acknowledgments section. This was my wake-up call about the need to speak up for myself regarding authorship, and to speak out against the unfair convention of diminishing the contributions of undergrads and technicians to scientific research. > “When I insisted that I should be an author … they told me I had ‘just’ been a technician.” As an undergraduate, I was just excited to be involved in science and making discoveries. I was oblivious to the true currency of science: publications. I dived into my assigned project to develop and optimize a cell culturing system, then collected as much preliminary data as I could. In a conversation with the principal investigator and postdoc I worked with, they mentioned that I would be the first or second author when they published the work, but we didn't get into specifics. After leaving the lab, I was in contact with the postdoc and the graduate student who took over the project, eager to be a co-author on my first paper. Then, I got some bad news: The cell lines I had been working with were contaminated. The graduate student had repeated my experiments—based on the protocol I had written, methods I had taught him, and observations and interpretations I had shared—and he was able to replicate the phenomena I had observed. He assured me that my contributions were still recognized and that I would be third author on the eventual paper. I went on to start graduate school myself. I occasionally checked in with the graduate student and postdoc about the project and offered to help write the manuscript. When the student told me that he was postponing submission for personal reasons, I decided to back off, expecting that they would reach out when they needed my input. Eventually, after not hearing anything from them for more than a year, I emailed to check in. That's when I learned that the paper had already been written, submitted, and accepted for publication—and I had been excluded from the process and the author list. Instead, I was acknowledged “for preliminary studies and technical expertise.” When I insisted that I should be an author, as we had discussed, they told me I had “just” been a technician. Most journals' policies state that authorship should be based on making a significant contribution to the conception or design of the work, or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data. Authors may also be required to help write the manuscript, but guidelines from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors—which the journal that published this paper adheres to—state that this requirement is not meant to disqualify individuals who otherwise meet the criteria. Based on that definition, my contributions did merit authorship. I was hurt to see my work being trivialized—in large part, I believe, because I had done it as an undergraduate technician. I now work in a different discipline, so I hope I can share my story without jeopardizing my future career. In retrospect, I should have initiated explicit conversations about authorship from the beginning, with all members of the project. Before I left the lab, I should have written up my results and methods in a format that could readily be included in the eventual paper. But the community needs to address a broader problem: the convention of excluding undergraduate students and technicians from authorship lists. A researcher's title doesn't make their contribution any less significant. Junior researchers are often critical to a project's success, and we need to make sure that everyone who contributes gets the credit they deserve."
