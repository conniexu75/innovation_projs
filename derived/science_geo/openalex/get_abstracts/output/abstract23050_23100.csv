https://openalex.org/W2094795801,"Recent experiments, advances in theory, and analogies to other complex systems such as glasses and spin glasses yield insight into protein dynamics. The basis of the understanding is the observation that the energy landscape is complex: Proteins can assume a large number of nearly isoenergetic conformations (conformational substates). The concepts that emerge from studies of the conformational substates and the motions between them permit a quantitative discussion of one simple reaction, the binding of small ligands such as carbon monoxide to myoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2167119720,"Fragile X syndrome results from mutations in a (CGG)n repeat found in the coding sequence of the FMR-1 gene. Analysis of length variation in this region in normal individuals shows a range of allele sizes varying from a low of 6 to a high of 54 repeats. Premutations showing no phenotypic effect in fragile X families range in size from 52 to over 200 repeats. All alleles with greater than 52 repeats, including those identified in a normal family, are meiotically unstable with a mutation frequency of one, while 75 meioses of alleles of 46 repeats and below have shown no mutation. Premutation alleles are also mitotically unstable as mosaicism is observed. The risk of expansion during oogenesis to the full mutation associated with mental retardation increases with the number of repeats, and this variation in risk accounts for the Sherman paradox."

https://openalex.org/W2089882643,"Retroviral DNA integration involves a coordinated set of DNA cutting and joining reactions. Linear viral DNA is cleaved at each 3' end to generate the precursor ends for integration. The resulting recessed 3' ends are inserted into target DNA by a subsequent DNA strand transfer reaction. Purified HIV-1 integration protein carries out both of these steps in vitro. Two novel forms of the dinucleotide cleaved from HIV-1 DNA were identified and one, a cyclic dinucleotide, was used to analyze the stereochemical course of viral DNA cleavage. Both viral DNA cleavage and DNA strand transfer display inversion at chiral phosphorothioates during the course of the reaction. These results suggest that both reactions occur by a one-step mechanism without involvement of a covalent protein-DNA intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2021828774,"The current view of how steroid hormone receptors affect gene transcription is that these receptors, on binding ligand, change to a state in which they can interact with chromatin and regulate transcription of target genes. Receptor activation is believed to be dependent only on this ligand-binding event. Selected steroid hormone receptors can be activated in a ligand-independent manner by a membrane receptor agonist, the neurotransmitter dopamine. In vitro, dopamine faithfully mimicked the effect of progesterone by causing a translocation of chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) from cytoplasm to nucleus. Dual activation by progesterone and dopamine was dissociable, and a serine residue in the cPR was identified that is not necessary for progesterone-dependent activation of cPR, but is essential for dopamine activation of this receptor."

The normal lyt-10 cDNA codes for a 98 kd protein which displays amino-terminal homology with the rel (DNA-binding) domain of the NF-κB-rel family of transcription factors and carboxy-terminal homology with the NF-κB p50 precursor protein, including the putative proteolytic cleavage domain (poly-G) and the ankyrin-like repeat domains. The lyt-10 protein can bind to κB sequences in vitro, although with different specificity from NF-κB p50, and in vitro DNA-binding is activated by removal of the ankyrin domain. Chromosomal translocation generates an lyt-10-Cα1 fusion gene coding for a protein that retains the rel effector domain, lacks the ankyrin regulatory domain, and binds κB sequences in vitro, suggesting its constitutive activation in vivo. Analogous rearrangements of the lyt-10 gene have been found in an additional three cases of lymphoid neoplasia. The lyt-10 gene defines a new subfamily (rel/poly-G/ankyrin) of NF-κB-rel transcription factors with potential for oncogenic activation in human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1995762555,"RABIES infection of domestic and wild animals is a serious problem throughout the world. The major disease vector in Europe is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and rabies control has focused on vaccinating and/or culling foxes. Culling has not been effective, and the distribution of live vaccine baits is the only appropriate method for the vaccination of wild foxes1. Although some European countries have conducted field vaccination campaigns using attenuated rabies virus strains2-5, their use has not been extensively approved because they retain pathogenicity for rodents and can revert to virulence6,7. These strains cannot be used in North America because they are pathogenic for the striped skunk(Mephitis mephitis)8 and are ineffective in the racoon (Procyonlotor)9. We have constructed a recombinant vaccinia virus10, VVTGgRAB, expressing the surface glycoprotein (G) of rabies virus (ERA strain)11–13. The recombinant was a highly effective vaccine in experimental animals11–13, in captive foxes14,15 and in racoons9. We report here the results of a large-scale campaign of fox vaccination in a 2,200 km2 region of southern Belgium, an area in which rabies is prevalent. After distribution, 81% of foxes inspected were positive for tetracycline, a biomarker included in the vaccine bait and, other than one rabid fox detected close to the periphery of the treated area, no case of rabies, either in foxes or in domestic livestock, has been reported in the area."

https://openalex.org/W2095606352,"Peptides corresponding to the proposed coated pit internalization signal of the native low density lipoprotein receptor, NPVY, take up in aqueous solution a reverse-turn conformation with the Asn in position i and the Tyr in position i + 3. By contrast, peptides derived from receptors that are defective for endocytosis do not adopt the reverse turn. These internalization-defective receptors include those with a nonaromatic residue substituted for the Tyr and those with Asn----Ala or Pro----Ala substitutions. While the tendency of an Asn-Pro sequence to induce a reverse turn was anticipated, the structural importance of an aromatic residue in position i + 3 was not. The sequences associated with the internalization signal thus appear to play a critical conformational role that is required for endocytosis, probably by enabling binding to adaptor molecules. With the results presented in the accompanying paper on lysosomal acid phosphatase, we now have direct evidence for previous proposals of a general correlation of internalization signals with a turn conformational motif."
https://openalex.org/W1513220709,"The alternatively spliced type III connecting segment (IIICS) region of fibronectin contains two distinct sites that support the adhesion of melanoma cells. These sites are contained within the synthetic peptides CS1 and CS5 (residues 1-25 and 90-109 of the IIICS, respectively). Recently, the cellular receptor for the CS1 site has been identified as the integrin heterodimer alpha 4 beta 1. In this report, we have investigated the role of the CS5 sequence in melanoma cell adhesion and the identity of its receptor. Adhesion to CS5, when presented to cells as an immobilized IgG conjugate, was blocked by antifunctional monoclonal antibodies directed against either the alpha 4 or beta 1 integrin subunits, but not by antibodies against other subunits, implying that alpha 4 beta 1 is also the receptor for CS5. In peptide inhibition experiments, CS5 was inhibitory for melanoma cell spreading on both CS5-IgG and CS1-IgG conjugates; conversely, CS1 inhibited spreading on both CS1-IgG and CS5-IgG. In both cases, peptide inhibition could be outcompeted by increasing the concentration of substrate-bound conjugate. These results suggest that CS1 and CS5 are recognized by the same or overlapping sites on alpha 4 beta 1. The minimal active sequence within CS5, the tetrapeptide Arg-Glu-Asp-Val (REDV), is somewhat related to the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) sequence that represents a major active site in the central cell-binding domain (CCBD) of fibronectin. When RGDS peptide homologues were tested for their ability to inhibit spreading of melanoma cells on CS1- and CS5-IgG conjugates, GRGDS, GRGES, and REDV were found to be inhibitory, while GRDGS had no effect. In contrast, spreading on a fibronectin fragment containing the CCBD was inhibited by GRGDS only. GRGDS was also able to elute alpha 4 beta 1 specifically from a CS1 affinity column, confirming directly that alpha 4 beta 1-IIICS interactions are sensitive to peptides containing this recognition motif. Because the minimal active sequence within CS1 is the tripeptide Leu-Asp-Val (LDV; Komoriya et al., manuscript submitted for publication), these findings together define a new adhesive recognition sequence, X-Asp-Y, used by alpha 4 beta 1 for binding to fibronectin. The central aspartate residue in this tripeptide is almost always essential, but some flexibility in the amino acid residues at X (glycine, leucine, or glutamic acid) and Y (serine or valine) is tolerated. Potential models for the interaction of the IIICS region with alpha 4 beta 1 are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2132170925,"We have analyzed the interaction of the general RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIID with its DNA-binding site, the TATA box (consensus sequence TATAAAA). We have demonstrated that TFIID, unlike most sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, interacts primarily within the minor groove of the DNA helix. This was established by a novel approach involving complete replacement of the thymines and adenines in the TATA box with cytosines and inosines, respectively. This substitution exchanged the major groove of TATAAAA for that of the sequence CGCGGGG, without altering the surface of the minor groove. The unusual DNA-binding properties of TFIID revealed by this study have important implications for TFIID specificity and function and, more generally, for sequence-specific recognition by DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2008917724,"In mammals, retinol is the precursor for retinoids, which affect various aspects of morphogenesis and development. However, B lymphocytes, although retinol-dependent, do not use retinoic acid as mediator. Retinol is metabolized by B lymphocytes and other cell lines to optically active 14-hydroxy-4,14-retro-retinol; it is this compound that mediates the growth control. Thus another second messenger molecule, in addition to retinoic acid and retinal, is derived from retinol."
https://openalex.org/W2050960932,"For rapid endocytosis lysosomal acid phosphatase requires a Tyr-containing signal in its cytoplasmic domain, as do cell surface receptors mediating endocytosis and clustering in coated pits. To determine the structure of the internalization signal an 18 amino acid peptide representing the cytoplasmic tail of lysosomal acid phosphatase was analyzed by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Part of the peptide, 5-PPGY-8, forms a well-ordered beta turn of type I in solution. Our result and data on the structure of the endocytosis signal of the low density lipoprotein receptor reported by Bansal and Gierasch in the accompanying paper represent experimental determinations of the three-dimensional structure of protein transport signals and suggest that the essential aromatic amino acid of internalization signals is recognized by a putative cytoplasmic receptor in the structural context of a tight turn."
https://openalex.org/W2057153975,"TFIID binding in the minor groove of DNA at the TATA element was demonstrated by methylation interference and hydroxyl radical footprinting assays, and by binding studies with thymine analog substituted oligonucleotides. These results provide an explanation for TFIID-dependent DNA bending at the TATA element. TFIID binding shows phosphate contacts with the same residues that were found to be essential for TFIID interactions by methylation and thymine-specific modification interference assays. Based on previous studies implicating residues conserved between the direct repeats in DNA binding, as well as models of prokaryotic DNA binding proteins, these results also suggest a model in which the direct repeats of TFIID form two basic antiparallel beta ribbon arms that could contact DNA through the minor groove."
https://openalex.org/W1984739916,"The development of the Drosophila R7 photoreceptor cell is determined by a specific inductive interaction between the R8 photoreceptor cell and a single neighboring precursor cell. This process is mediated by bride of sevenless (boss), a cell-surface bound ligand, and the sevenless (sev) tyrosine kinase receptor. The boss ligand is expressed specifically on the surface of the R8 cell, whereas the sev receptor is expressed on 5 cells contacting the developing R8 cell and other cells not in contact with R8. By altering the spatial and temporal expression of boss, we demonstrate that sev-expressing cells that do not contact R8 can assume an R7 cell fate. By contrast, the sev-expressing precursor cells to the R1–R6 photoreceptor cells that do contact R8 are nonresponsive to the inductive cue. Using the rough and Nspl mutations, we demonstrate that an early commitment to an R1–R6 cell fate blocks the pathway of sev activation in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2100507403,"Chemotaxis of the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii to chitin oligosaccharides has been described (Bassler, B. L., Gibbons, P. J., Yu, C., and Roseman, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24268-24275). Some steps in catabolism of the oligosaccharides are reported here. GlcNAc, (GlcNAc)2, and (GlcNAc)3 are very rapidly consumed by intact cells, about 320 nmol of GlcNAc equivalents/min/mg of protein. (GlcNAc)4 is utilized somewhat more slowly. During these processes, there is virtually no release of hydrolysis products by the cells. The oligosaccharides enter the periplasmic space (via specific porins?) and are hydrolyzed by a unique membrane-bound endoenzyme (chitodextrinase) and an exoenzyme (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase; beta-Glc-NAcidase). The genes encoding these enzymes have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The chitodextrinase cleaves soluble oligomers, but not chitin, to the di- and trisaccharides, while the periplasmic beta-GlcNAcidase hydrolyzes the GlcNAc termini from the oligomers. The end products in the periplasm, GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 (possibly (GlcNAc)3) are catabolized as follows. (a) Disaccharide pathway, A (GlcNAc)2 permease is apparently expressed by Vibrio furnissii. Translocated (GlcNAc)2 is rapidly hydrolyzed by a soluble, cytosolic beta-GlcNAcidase, and the GlcNAc is phosphorylated by an ATP-dependent, constitutive kinase to GlcNAc-6-P. (b) Monosaccharide pathway, Periplasmic GlcNAc is taken up by Enzyme IINag of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system, yielding GlcNAc-6-P, the common intermediate for both pathways. Finally, GlcNAc-6-P----Ac- + GlcNH2-6-P----Fru-6-P + NH3. (GlcNAc)2 is probably the true inducer of the chitin degradative enzymes described in this report and, depending on its concentration in the growth medium, differentially induces the periplasmic and cytosolic beta-GlcNAcidases. The disaccharide pathway appears to be the most important when the cells are confronted with low concentrations of the oligomers (e.g. in chemotaxis swarm plates). The relative activities of the induced enzymes suggest that the rate-limiting steps in oligosaccharide catabolism are the glycosidase activities in the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1565223565,"The gene encoding for an extremely thermostable oligo-1,6-glucosidase from Bacillus thermoglucosidasius KP1006 (DSM2542, obligate thermophile) was sequenced. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gene (1686 base pairs) corresponded to a protein of 562 amino acid residues with a Mr of 66,502. Its predicted amino acid composition, Mr, and N-terminal sequence of 12 residues were consistent with those determined for B. thermoglucosidasius oligo-1,6-glucosidase. The deduced sequence of the enzyme was 72% homologous to that of a thermolabile oligo-1,6-glucosidase (558 residues) from Bacillus cereus ATCC7064 (mesophile). B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase contained 19 prolines. Eighteen of these were conserved at the equivalent positions of B. thermoglucosidasius oligo-1,6-glucosidase. This enzyme contained 14 extra prolines besides the conservative prolines. The majority of extra prolines was replaced by polar or charged residues (Glu, Thr, or Lys) in B. cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase. The extra prolines were responsible for the difference in thermostability between these two enzymes. We suggested that 11 of the extra prolines in B. thermoglucosidasius oligo-1,6-glucosidase occur in beta-turns or in coils within the loops binding adjacent secondary structures."
https://openalex.org/W1479894082,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease optimally catalyzes in the pH range of 4-6 in contrast to nearly all of the other eukaryotic aspartic proteases, which catalyze best in the pH range of 2-4. A possible structural reason for the higher optimal pH of HIV-1 protease is the absence of a hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group of active-site Asp25, which is nearly universally present in others. To investigate this hypothesis, we have mutated residue 28 in HIV-1 protease from alanine to serine. Both the wild-type and the mutant A28S enzymes have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli using a chemically synthesized gene and purified for a comparative study in enzyme kinetics. The kcat and Km values were determined by a radiometric assay for the wild-type enzyme from pH 3.2 to 7.0, and for the mutant enzyme from pH 3.2 to 6.0. The low pK values of the active site of the free enzyme, pKe1, are 3.3 and 3.4 for the wild-type and mutant enzymes, respectively. The low pK values of the active site of the enzyme bound to substrate, pKes1, are 5.1 and 4.3 for the wild-type and mutant enzymes, respectively. The high pK values of the free enzyme, pKe2, are 6.8 and 5.6, and the corresponding ones for the substrate-bound enzyme, pKes2, are 6.9 and 6.0 for the wild-type and mutant enzymes, respectively. The lowering of pK values in mutant HIV-1 protease indicates that the hydroxyl group of Ser28 forms a new hydrogen bond to active-site Asp25 to increase its acidity."

https://openalex.org/W1673140692,"Chitin turnover is essential for recycling carbon and nitrogen in marine ecosystems. A key step in this process is the adhesion of marine bacteria to chitin-containing particulates. Vibrio species were therefore surveyed for their ability to bind to immobilized carbohydrates, and one, Vibrio furnissii, adhered to glycosides of three sugars, N-acetylglucosamine (the preferred ligand), D-mannose, and D-glucose. A single Ca(2+)-requiring lectin is responsible for binding to the three sugars. Cells adhering to the chitin analogue divided at the same rate as cells in liquid culture. The first progeny of adherent cells continued to bind to the beads, but the population gradually shifted to a large fraction of free swimming cells, a process that may be necessary for colonization. Metabolic energy is required for cell adhesion to the glycosides, and transient (or no) adhesion occurred in incomplete growth media. The results were explained by studying met and pro mutants. Both the initiation and maintenance of lectin-mediated adhesion requires continuous protein synthesis; expression of lectin activity is a major priority of these cells and functions under conditions adequate for minimal protein synthesis, but insufficient to support cell growth. The adhesion/deadhesion apparatus is apparently used to continuously monitor the nutrient status of the environment, i.e. as a nutrient sensorium. In incomplete medium, cells deadhere, presumably to migrate to a more favorable environment."
https://openalex.org/W1598613626,"A cDNA clone complementary to an interferon (IFN)-induced mRNA was isolated and used to characterize the regulation of expression of its RNA by the IFNs and to identify the protein its RNA encodes. This cDNA hybridizes to IFN-induced 3.1- and 2.3-kilobase mRNAs that are synthesized in response to both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma induces the sustained accumulation of these mRNAs while IFN-alpha induces their transient accumulation. Cycloheximide (50 micrograms/ml) failed to inhibit the induction of these mRNAs by either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, suggesting that their induction does not require de novo protein synthesis. DNA sequence analysis of this cDNA reveals that it encodes a protein of Mr 53,168 that has sequence homology with and the biological activity of a tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzymatic activity that has been demonstrated to play a role in and be modulated by the growth of cells. Elevated levels of this enzyme may be involved in the cell growth inhibitory activity of the IFNs."
https://openalex.org/W1679034178,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to study the cysteine residue involved in the assembly of human acetylcholinesterase (HuAChE) catalytic subunits. Substitution of the cysteine at position 580 by alanine resulted in impairment of interchain disulfide bridge formation; the mutagenized enzyme (C580A) was secreted from recombinant cells in the monomeric form and failed to assemble into dimers. The mutant monomeric HuAChE did not differ from the native oligomeric enzyme neither in rate of catalysis nor in affinity to acetylthiocholine. Mutant monomers were also shown to retain the acetylcholinesterase characteristic sensitivity to high substrate concentrations. The mutation did not seem to affect the efficiencies of either synthesis or secretion of recombinant HuAChE polypeptides, as was demonstrated in cell lines derived from human embryonic kidney (293 cells) as well as from a human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH). Furthermore, the mutation did not lead to an increase in accumulation of intracellular HuAChE polypeptides, suggesting that export of acetylcholinesterase from cells may not be coupled to subunit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1603553262,"Human aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) and aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) are implicated in the development of diabetic complications by a variety of mechanisms, and a number of drugs to inhibit these enzymes have been proposed for the therapy and prevention of these complications. To probe the structure and function of these two enzymes, we used site-directed mutagenesis in the cDNAs of both enzymes to replace lysine 262 with methionine. Wild-type and mutant enzymes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by anion exchange and affinity chromatography. N-terminal sequence analysis, Western blots, and kinetic studies confirmed the identity of the recombinant wild-type enzymes with the native human placental and liver enzymes. Recombinant aldose reductase (hAR) and aldehyde reductase (hGR) have apparent kinetic constants virtually identical to their respective native enzymes. The mutant aldose reductase (hARK262 greater than M) shows a 66-fold increase in Km for NADPH with respect to the wild type (1.9 +/- 0.4 microM versus 125 +/- 14 microM), whereas the Km for DL-glyceraldehyde increased 35-fold (20 +/- 2 versus 693 +/- 41 microM). The same constants for the mutant aldehyde reductase (hGRK262 greater than M) increased 97- and 86-fold, respectively (from 2.0 +/- 0.4 to 194 +/- 16 microM and from 1.6 +/- 0.4 to 137 +/- 3 mM). These results indicate that lysine 262 in aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase is crucial to their catalytic activity by affecting co-factor binding."
https://openalex.org/W1555521195,"Abstract The adhesion/deadhesion apparatus of the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii (Yu, C., Lee, A., Bassler, B. L., and Roseman, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24260-24267) probably catalyzes the first step in colonizing chitin. Evidence is presented here for a second step, chemotaxis to chitin hydrolysis products. V. furnissii swarms toward chitin oligomers (GlcNAc)n, n = 1-6, at initial concentrations as low as 10 microM. A modified capillary assay was used for quantitation; the cells exhibit low level constitutive taxis to GlcNAc but not to the oligosaccharides. A mutant defective in the GlcNAc receptor (IINag of the phosphotransferase system) showed inducible taxis to the oligosaccharides. Two (or more) independently inducible receptors with overlapping specificities recognize (GlcNAc)n, n = 2-4. (GlcNAc)5 and (GlcNAc)6 were inactive in the capillary assay; expression of this receptor(s) apparently require special induction conditions. The (GlcNAc)n, n = 1-4, chemoreceptors of V. furnissii may be the most potent reported for bacteria. L-Amino acids were weak, constitutive attractants; glutamine, not known to be an attractant in other bacteria, was the most effective amino acid. The most potent receptor in Escherichia coli, Tar (aspartate), is not expressed in V. furnissii. The chemotactic responses were greatly affected by growth and induction conditions and the presence of nutrients in the assay media. Taxis to GlcNAc and GlcNAc oligomers was optimally induced by growth in lactate medium containing 0.6 mM sugar, while growth on the sugar per se resulted in poor taxis. Chemotaxis to the sugars increased 2- to 3-fold when the cells were starved. Nutrients in the assay medium, especially compounds that feed into or are part of the Krebs cycle, were potent inhibitors of taxis to the sugars and Gln. With the exception of isocitrate, inhibition of taxis correlated with the rate of oxidation of these compounds. The results suggest a link between catabolism and taxis in this organism, i.e. interactions or cross-talk between systems that are regulated by protein phosphorylation (Stock, J. A., Ninfa, A. J., and Stock, A. M. (1989) Microbiol. Rev. 53, 450-490)."

Transfection of PSA-3 cells with a cDNA expression library of CHO-K1 (the parent of PSA-3) yielded a phosphatidylserine-prototrophic transformant with normal phosphatidylserine synthase I activity. Using a cDNA segment retrieved from the transformant as a probe, a cDNA clone (pssA) responsible for phosphatidylserine prototrophy was isolated from the original cDNA library by colony filter hybridization. Introduction of the pssA cDNA into PSA-3 cells restored the phosphatidylserine content, and the resultant transformant exhibited 15-fold higher specific phosphatidylserine synthase I activity than CHO-K1 cells. The nucleotide sequence of the pssA cDNA contained a single long open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 471 amino acid residues with several putative membrane-spanning domains. Our results indicated that the pssA cDNA encodes an integral membrane protein essential for phosphatidylserine synthase I activity."

WBAI is a dimer with two binding sites. The titration calorimetry yielded single-site binding constants ranging from 0.56 +/- 0.14 x 10(3) M-1 for Gal at 323.15 K to 7.2 +/- 0.5 x 10(3) M-1 for GalNAc at 298.15 K and binding enthalpies ranging from -28.0 +/- 2.0 kJ mol-1 for GalNAc at 298.15 K to -14.3 +/- 0.1 kJ mol-1 for methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside at 322.65 K. The denaturation transition consisted of two overlapping peaks over the pH range 5.6-7.4. Fits of the differential scanning calorimetry data to a two-state transition model showed that the low temperature transition (341.6 +/- 0.4 K at pH 7.4) consisted of two domains unfolding as a single entity while the higher temperature transition (347.8 +/- 0.6 K at pH 7.4) is of the remaining WBAI dimer unfolding into two monomers. Both transitions shift to higher temperatures and higher calorimetric enthalpies with increase in added ligand concentration at pH 7.4. Analysis of the temperature increase as a function of added ligand concentration suggests that one ligand binds to the two domains unfolding at 341.6 +/- 0.6 K and one ligand binds to the domain unfolding at 347.8 +/- 0.6 K."
https://openalex.org/W1540279731,"We have previously used monoclonal antibodies to identify an epitope on the heavy chain of factor XIa that is a substrate-binding site for factor IX (Sinha, D., Seaman, F.S., and Walsh, P.N. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 3768-3775; Baglia, F.A., Sinha, D., and Walsh, P.N. (1989) Blood 74, 244-251). To define the factor XIa domain that binds factor IX, we have now screened a panel of factor XI heavy chain-derived synthetic peptides for their capacity to inhibit the formation of an activation peptide reflecting factor IX activation by factor XIa. Peptide Asn145-Ala176 (which is located in the second tandem repeat or A2 domain of the factor XI heavy chain) is a competitive inhibitor of factor IX activation by factor XIa with a Ki of 30 nM, whereas structurally similar peptides in the A1, A3, and A4 domains were required at 10-1000-fold higher concentrations for similar effects, and a synthetic peptide identical with a highly homologous region of the heavy chain A2 domain of prekallikrein (Tyr143-Ala176) had no effect on factor IX activation by factor XIa. Because detailed structural information is lacking, a potential three-dimensional structure for the factor XI A2 domain was calculated based on its sequence information in conjunction with previously determined structural constraints. The resulting structure depicted three juxtaposed beta-stranded stem-loops that, based on biological information, constitute a candidate surface for contact with factor IX. The A2 model was therefore used as a template in the rational design of three synthetic peptides (Ala134-Ile146 (peptide a), Leu148-Arg159 (peptide b), and Ile160-Leu172 (peptide c]. When peptides a and b or a and c were added together and the activation of factor IX by factor XIa was examined, a synergistic inhibitory effect was observed, compared with each peptide added individually, whereas peptides b and c showed additive effects. Our data suggest that the sequence of amino acids from Ala134 through Leu172 of the heavy chain of factor XI contains three antiparallel beta-strands connected by beta-turns that together comprise a continuous surface utilized for the binding of factor IX."

We show that the smallest, a 10-kDa component of three enzymes (A10, B10, and C10), is heterogeneous. In each case, it can be resolved into two distinct polypeptides (alpha and beta) by reverse-phase chromatography. A10 alpha, B10 alpha, and C10 alpha were indistinguishable on the basis of their electrophoretic and chromatographic behaviors, characteristic silver staining, and tryptic peptide analysis. All three polypeptides are blocked at their amino termini. By the same criteria, A10 beta, B10 beta, and C10 beta were also indistinguishable. The amino-terminal sequence of A10 beta and C10 beta corresponded to that of subunit B10 recently cloned by Woychik and Young (Woychik, N. A., and Young, R. A. (1990) J. Biol.

Thus, the three forms of RNA polymerase share two additional and distinct polypeptides, ABC10 alpha and ABC10 beta, that therefore can be considered bona fide subunits of these enzymes. Interestingly, these two subunits bind zinc."
https://openalex.org/W1528254880,"Scavenger receptors have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and other macrophage-associated functions. The structures and processing of type I and type II bovine macrophage scavenger receptors were examined using polyclonal anti-receptor antibodies. Pulse/chase metabolic labeling experiments showed that both types of scavenger receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells behaved as typical cell surface membrane glycoproteins. They were synthesized as endoglycosidase H-sensitive precursors which were converted to endoglycosidase H-resistant mature forms expressed on the cell surface. The reduced precursor and mature forms were doublets on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, primarily because of heterogeneous N-glycosylation. The approximate molecular sizes were: type I precursor, 65/63 kDa; type I mature, 82/76 kDa; type II precursor, 57/53 kDa; and type II mature, 72/65 kDa. During post-translational processing, the cysteine-rich C terminus (SRCR domain) of some of the type I receptors was proteolytically removed to form a relatively stable, approximately 69-kDa degradation product. Type II receptors differ from type I receptors in that they do not have SRCR domains and an analogous proteolytic cleavage was not observed. Several experiments provided strong evidence that the Gly-X-Y-repeat domains in the scavenger receptors oligomerize into collagenous triple helices. For example, alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl, an inhibitor of the collagen-modifying enzymes prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases, interfered with both the kinetics and nature of post-translational receptor processing, and both precursor and mature forms of the receptors in intact cells could be cross-linked with difluorodinitrobenzene into reduction-resistant trimers. In intact cells, precursor receptor trimers (type I, 198 kDa; type II, 176 kDa) were assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum by the noncovalent association of monomers and Cys83-disulfide-linked dimers (type I, 129 kDa; type II, 119 kDa). When cells were lysed in the absence of the sulfhydryl trapping agent iodoacetamide, oxidation of the side chain of Cys17 in the cytoplasmic domain leads to the artifactual formation of reduction-sensitive covalently linked trimers. The approximate masses of the mature dimer and trimer forms were 162 and 237 kDa for type I receptors and 147 and 219 kDa for type II receptors. Cys83-disulfide-linked dimer formation was not required for function because mutant receptors (Cys83----Gly83) assembled into trimers of noncovalently associated monomers and exhibited normal receptor activity. Treatment of cells with difluorodinitrobenzene cross-linked some of the receptors into complexes larger than trimers, raising the possibility that the trimers may assemble into higher order oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W1823002270,"Vomeromodulin, a novel glycoprotein of lateral nasal gland, has been cloned by differential hybridization from nasal/olfactory tissue. The 2.2-kb mRNA directs the in vitro synthesis of a 60-kDa primary translation product in reticulocyte lysates. Differential sensitivity to endoglycosidases indicates that vomeromodulin is posttranslationally modified in vivo by N-glycosylation to form a 70-kDa glycoprotein of the complex type. Immunocytochemical localization with two different antipeptide antisera demonstrates that vomeromodulin is abundant in the lateral nasal glands and is also present in the posterior septal and vomeronasal glands. Most striking is the observation that it is highly concentrated in the mucus of the vomeronsal organ of Jacobson but is not detectable in the mucus of the main olfactory neuroepithelium. Evaluation of mRNA and protein distribution by Northern and Western analyses, respectively, indicates that vomeromodulin is absent from 15 other tissues. The glandular and mucosal distribution of this glycoprotein implies a transport function that may be related to the mechanisms by which pheromones of low volatility gain access to their receptors in the vomeronasal organ. These observations support our hypothesis that vomeromodulin participates in perireceptor events that facilitate the process of pheromone access and detection.—Khew-Goodall, Y.; Grillo, M.; Getchell, M.

https://openalex.org/W1536215014,"To test the idea that the in vitro motility assay is a simplified model system for muscle contraction, the MgATP-dependent movement of actin filaments by thiophosphorylated smooth muscle myosin was characterized in the presence of the products MgADP and inorganic phosphate. The dependence of actin filament velocity on MgATP concentration was hyperbolic with a maximum velocity of 0.6 micron/s and an apparent Km = 40 microM (30 degrees C). MgADP competitively inhibited actin movement by MgATP with a Ki = 0.25 mM. Inorganic phosphate did not affect actin filament velocity in the presence of 1 mM MgATP, but competitively inhibited movement in the presence of 50 microM MgATP with a Ki = 9.5 mM. The effects of ADP and Pi on velocity agree with fiber mechanical studies, confirming that the motility assay is an excellent system to investigate the molecular mechanisms of force generation and shortening in smooth muscle. The rate at which rigor cross-bridges can be recruited to move actin filaments was observed by initiating cross-bridge cycling from rigor by flash photolysis of caged MgATP. Following the flash, which results in a rapid increase in MgATP concentration, actin filaments experienced a MgATP-dependent delay prior to achieving steady state velocity. The delay at low MgATP concentrations was interpreted as evidence that motion generating cross-bridges are slowed by a load due to a transiently high percentage of rigor cross-bridges immediately following MgATP release."
https://openalex.org/W1511456917,"During reaction with [14C]iodoacetamide at pH 6.3, radioactivity was incorporated primarily into a single Klebsiella aerogenes urease peptide concomitant with activity loss. This peptide was protected from modification at pH 6.3 by inclusion of phosphate, a competitive inhibitor of urease, which also protected the enzyme from inactivation. At pH 8.5, several peptides were alkylated; however, modification of one peptide, identical to that modified at pH 6.3, paralleled activity loss. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and composition of the peptide containing the essential thiol was determined. Previous enzyme inactivation studies of K. aerogenes urease could not distinguish whether one or two essential thiols were present per active site (Todd, M. J., and Hausinger, R. P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10260-10267); we conclude that there is a single essential thiol present and identify this residue as Cys319 in the large subunit of the heteropolymeric enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1521156920,"Glycophorin A, the most abundant sialoglycoprotein on human red blood cells, carries several medically important blood group antigens. To study the role of glycosylation in surface expression and antigenicity of this highly glycosylated protein (1 N-linked and 15 O-linked oligosaccharides), glycophorin A cDNA (M-allele) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Both wild type CHO cells and mutant CHO cells with well defined glycosylation defects were used. Glycophorin A was well expressed on the surface of transfected wild type CHO cells. On immunoblots, the CHO cells expressed monomer (approximately 38 kDa) and dimer forms of glycophorin A which co-migrated with human red blood cell glycophorin A. The transfected cells specifically expressed the M blood group antigen when tested with mouse monoclonal antibodies. Tunicamycin treatment of these CHO cells did not block surface expression of glycophorin A, indicating that, in the presence of normal O-linked glycosylation, the N-linked oligosaccharide is not required for surface expression. To study O-linked glycosylation, glycophorin A cDNA was transfected into the Lec 2, Lec 8, and ldlD glycosylation-deficient CHO cell lines. Glycophorin A with truncated O-linked oligosaccharides was well expressed on the surface of ldlD cells (cultured in the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine alone), Lec 2 cells, and Lec 8 cells with monomers of approximately 25 kDa, approximately 33 kDa, and approximately 25 kDa, respectively. In contrast, non-O-glycosylated glycophorin A (approximately 19-kDa monomers) was poorly expressed on the surface of ldlD cells cultured in the absence of both galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine. Thus, under these conditions, in the absence of O-linked glycosylation, the N-linked oligosaccharide itself is not able to support appropriate surface expression of glycophorin A in transfected CHO cells."
https://openalex.org/W1564886898,"Previous investigations have indicated that the suppression of proliferation by transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 is often lost upon cellular transformation, and that proliferation of some tumors is stimulated by TGF-beta. The present study provides the first observation of a link between TGF-beta 1 regulation of this process and alterations in the expression of ribonucleotide reductase, a highly controlled rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis. A series of radiation and T24-H-ras-transformed mouse 10T1/2 cell lines exhibiting increasing malignant potential was evaluated for TGF-beta 1 induced alterations in ribonucleotide reductase M1 and M2 gene expression. Early increases in M1 and/or M2 message and protein levels were observed only in malignant cell lines. The TGF-beta 1 induced changes in M1 and/or M2 gene expression occurred prior to any detectable changes in the rates of DNA synthesis, supporting the novel concept that ribonucleotide reductase gene expression can be elevated by TGF-beta 1 without altering the proportion of cells in S phase. T24-H-ras-transformed 10T1/2 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the coding region of TGF-beta 1 under the control of a zinc-sensitive metallothionein promoter. When these cells were cultured in the presence of zinc, a large induction of TGF-beta 1 message was observed within 1 h. Both M1 and M2 genes were also induced, with increased mRNA levels appearing 2 h after zinc treatment, or 1 h after TGF-beta 1 message levels were clearly elevated. In total, the data suggests a mechanism of autocrine stimulation of malignant cells by TGF-beta 1, in which early alterations in the regulation of ribonucleotide reductase may play an important role."
https://openalex.org/W1552013715,"The biosynthesis and post-translational maturation of PC2, a neuroendocrine-specific Kex2-like endoprotease, following expression in Xenopus oocytes is described. The initial translation product was a 75-kDa membrane-associated protein which was released from the oocytes as a glycosylated 71-kDa protein. During extended chase periods, the extracellular 71-kDa protein was converted to a mature 68-kDa product. A deletion mutant lacking a putative COOH-terminal amphipathic helix was still membrane-associated, suggesting that this domain was not essential for attachment of PC2 to membranes. Two putative proregion cleavage site mutants were also constructed. Conversion of the 75-kDa peptide to the 71-kDa peptide involved cleavage at the sequence Lys-Arg-Arg-Arg (amino acids 78-81), since mutation of this sequence to Lys-Val-Arg-Leu resulted in the secretion of the 75-kDa peptide. Extracellular conversion of the 71-kDa peptide to the 68-kDa peptide involved cleavage at the sequence Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg (amino acids 106-109), since deletion of this tetrabasic sequence resulted in secretion of the 71-kDa peptide without further conversion to the 68-kDa form. Finally, a mutation which changed a catalytically important Asp to Asn did not affect processing of proPC2. These results may be relevant to our understanding of mechanisms in the intracellular sorting and maturation of proPC2 in neuroendocrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593771465,"Using Helix pomatia lectin as a specific probe for terminal, nonreducing N-acetylgalactosamine residues, glycoprotein precursors bearing newly initiated O-linked oligosaccharides have been localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi cisternae. This pattern contrasts with the detection of the terminal disaccharide galactose beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine by Arachis hypogaea lectin in middle and trans-Golgi compartments, which are considered elongation sites for O-glycosylation. Distribution of H. pomatia ligands in the endoplasmic reticulum is confined to specialized regions or subcompartments in both human colonic adenocarcinoma cells and cultured chicken chondrocytes. Since in cartilage, chondrocytes contain H. pomatia-binding sites exclusively concentrated in cis-Golgi cisternae, primary cultures of this cell type have been used to study those conditions that promote initiation of O-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. A correlation has been found between the age of the culture and the extent of reactivity of the endoplasmic reticulum with either H. pomatia lectin or antibody against the sequence GalNAc alpha-serine/threonine (Tn antigen). Cells showing an extensive reaction are not hindered in their secretory activity and still maintain the chondrocyte phenotype. Taken together the results suggest that the intracellular distribution of the glycosylation enzymes is not only cell type-specific as previously shown (Roth, J., Taatjes, D. J., Weinstein, J., Paulson, J. C., Greenwell, P., and Watkins, W. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14307-14312) but it might also vary depending on the stage of cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2065308646,"Guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of Ras is increased by interaction with Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) or with the GAP-related domain of the type 1 neurofibromatosis protein (NF1-GRD), but Ras is not affected by interaction with cytoplasmic and membrane forms of Rap-GAP; Rap1A, whose effector function can suppress transformation by Ras, is sensitive to both forms of Rap-GAP and resistant to Ras-GAP and NF1-GRD. A series of chimeric proteins composed of portions of Ras and Rap were constructed; some were sensitive to Ras-GAP but resistant to NF1-GRD, and others were sensitive to cytoplasmic Rap-GAP but resistant to membrane Rap-GAP. Sensitivity of chimeras to Ras-GAP and cytoplasmic Rap-GAP was mediated by amino acids that are carboxyl-terminal to the effector region. Residues 61 to 65 of Ras conferred Ras-GAP sensitivity, but a larger number of Rap1A residues were required for sensitivity to cytoplasmic Rap-GAP. Chimeras carrying the Ras effector region that were sensitive only to Ras-GAP or only to cytoplasmic Rap-GAP transformed NIH 3T3 cells poorly. Thus, distinct amino acids of Ras and Rap1A mediate sensitivity to each of the proteins with GAP activity, and transforming potential of Ras and sensitivity of Ras to Ras-GAP are at least partially independent properties."
https://openalex.org/W1489022720,"The region of the Xenopus laevis estrogen receptor responsible for interaction with DNA, the DNA binding domain (DBD), has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli using a T7 RNA polymerase expression system. Extracts from cells transformed with the DBD expression vector contain a single protein which reacts with polyclonal antibodies to estrogen receptor and exhibits sequence-specific binding to a DNA fragment containing a consensus estrogen response element. The DBD protein has been purified to near homogeneity. Determination of the rotational relaxation time of the dansylated DBD by fluorescence polarization and size fractionation by Superdex column chromatography indicate that the DBD is a monomer in solution. The DBD forms a single protein-estrogen response element complex in gel mobility shift assays at DBD concentrations of 18-3,600 nM, suggesting that the DBD is bound to both halves of the palindromic estrogen response element. To investigate the ability of the DBD expressed in bacteria to activate gene expression, we have developed a simple liposome-based system for delivery of protein into cultured cells. Transfected DBD protein elicited large, concentration-dependent increases in transcription of an estrogen receptor regulated reporter gene. These data demonstrate that the bacterially expressed DNA binding domain, which represents a small portion of the Xenopus laevis estrogen receptor, retains significant ability to activate transcription of an estrogen-responsive promoter in vertebrate cells."
https://openalex.org/W1514093779,"Thrombospondin (TS) is a multidomain, adhesive glycoprotein that associates with cells through multiple cell attachment sites. One of these has been located in or near the globular COOH-terminal region of TS by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) C6.7, which inhibits the attachment of human melanoma cells (G361) to TS. The epitope for C6.7 lies within the last 122 residues of the COOH-terminal domain of TS. This domain is distant from two known cell attachment sites in TS, namely the NH2-terminal heparin-binding domain and the CSVTCG sequences in the type I repeats, but is close to the RGDA sequence, an integrin-dependent cell attachment site. In order to separate the adhesive activity of the TS COOH-terminal domain from that of the RGD sequence, we have expressed the COOH-terminal 212 amino acids (residues 941-1152) of TS in Escherichia coli using the expression vector pRIT2T. The resultant fusion protein is effective in supporting G361 cell attachment even though it lacks the RGD sequence. In addition, the expressed protein inhibits adhesion of G361 cells to intact TS. mAb C6.7 blocks adhesion to the expressed TS COOH-terminal domain whereas GRGDSP and VTCG peptides are not inhibitory. These results show that the TS COOH-terminal domain contains a separate cell adhesion site, defined by mAb C6.7, that is distinct from the other adhesion sites of TS."
https://openalex.org/W1554303172,"Site-specific degradation of DNA was achieved by the use of DNA oligonucleotides covalently tethered to phenazine 5,10-di-N-oxide. When annealed to a complementary DNA target strand, the antisense oligonucleotide effected alkylation of guanosine residues in proximity to the phenazine di-N-oxide prosthetic group. Admixture of dithiothreitol to the formed duplex resulted in reductive activation of the phenazine di-N-oxide moiety with concomitant generation of diffusible oxygen radicals; the latter effected strand scission of the target DNA oligonucleotide. Several parameters of DNA degradation were studied, including the effect on DNA degradation of chain length in the tether connecting the oligonucleotides and prosthetic group, the relative efficiencies of DNA cleavage when the prosthetic group was in the middle or at the end of the antisense oligonucleotide, and the effect of O2 on DNA degradation. Also studied was the actual chemistry of DNA oligonucleotide degradation and the ability of individual diastereomers of the modified oligonucleotides to mediate degradation of the target DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1594958162,"Analysis of intracellular localization of protein kinase C (PKC) in a lymphoblastoid B cell line shows that anti-human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II antibodies induce an increase of cytosolic and membrane PKC activities. This phenomenon is both time- and dose-dependent. The maximal PKC activation was observed after exposure to 12.5 micrograms/ml antibody for 30 to 45 min. Unlike TPA, no translocation of the cytosolic PKC was observed at any time following exposure to the anti-HLA class II antibodies. We observed a good correlation between the [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding activity and the enzymatic activity of PKC. Using a panel of antibodies specific for the HLA class II isotypes (DP, DQ, DR), we demonstrated that PKC activation via HLA class II molecules is not restricted to one isotype. We also showed by Western blot analysis that the increased PKC activity correlates with a quantitative increase of PKC. The increase of PKC activity induced by anti-HLA class II antibodies was completely abolished by the treatment with actinomycin D, a transcriptional inhibitor, or cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor. Finally, Northern blot analysis revealed that anti-HLA class II antibodies induce an increase of the PKC alpha and PKC beta mRNAs levels which are significant after 20 min of stimulation and rose to a maximum after 60 min. In summary, our results show that increased PKC activity induced by HLA class II antibody is regulated at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1557592212,"Abstract The human transferrin gene enhancer is composed of two functional domains (A and B). We have previously shown that domain A is able to mediate enhancer activity in transient expression experiments. Here, we show that multimers of the domain A single enhanson coupled to a canonical TATA box are sufficient to promote transcription in vitro with liver nuclear extracts. Gel mobility shift assays reveal the binding of two liver nuclear factors to this enhanson, and methylation interference experiments show that the motif 5'-TGTTTGCTTT-3' is the target site for these factors. This was confirmed by the use of mutants in gel retardation assays and transient expression experiments. The two proteins interacting with the decanucleotide have been purified from rat liver nuclear extracts by DNA affinity chromatography. The purified proteins named enhancer-binding protein (EBP)-45 and EBP-40 appear as single polypeptide bands with respective molecular masses of 45 and 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The TGTTTGC motif was found to be important for the hepatocyte-specific expression of several genes; and in some cases, it was demonstrated that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) is able to bind to this sequence. In vitro experiments show that EBP-45 and EBP-40 are different from C/EBP; they also show that the two proteins interact with the TGTTTGC motif present in control regions of other hepatic genes, such as the mouse albumin enhancer eH and hepatitis B virus enhancer E elements."
https://openalex.org/W1548145439,"Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) is a protein that forms a very tight complex with ribonucleases (RNases) of the pancreatic type. RI contains 30 thiol groups, some of which are important for the enzyme-inhibitor interaction. To examine which thiols are affected by the binding of RNase, differential labeling experiments were performed. Reaction of porcine RI with the cysteine-specific labeling reagent 4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-iodoacetamido-2'-sulfonic acid resulted in labeling of an average of 7.4 of the 30 cysteinyl residues. Binding of bovine pancreatic RNase A caused a 3.2-fold reduction in the extent of modification. Peptide mapping showed that in free RI, Cys-57, -371, and -404 were labeled to the greatest extent (yield, 0.4-0.6 mol/mol). RNase A did not protect Cys-57 against modification, whereas the labeling of Cys-371 and -404 was reduced by more than 90%. A second group of residues was labeled to a lesser extent in free RI (yield, 0.04-0.2 mol/mol). Within this group 11 residues were protected by RNase A by more than 90%, 2 were not affected at all, and 7 were protected between 10 and 90%. Seven cysteinyl residues in RI that were protected in the RI.RNase A complex were no longer protected in the RI.S-protein complex. These residues were mainly present in the N-terminal region of RI. However, when the S-peptide was included to yield the RI.RNase S complex, the same pattern of labeling was obtained as with the RI.RNase A complex. Addition of the S-peptide alone had no effect on the labeling. The implications of these observations with respect to RNase binding areas of RI are discussed in relation to the results obtained from the analysis of active RI molecules that contain deletions."
https://openalex.org/W1939967765,"Methylation of ribose moieties appears to be an essential post-transcriptional event in ribosomal RNA maturation. Although the sites of ribose methylation have been identified, the components involved in the 2'-O-methylation of precursor ribosomal RNA in mammalian cells have not yet been elucidated. To investigate the involvement of a recently isolated nucleolar 2'-O-methyltransferase in this process, an in vitro synthesized 28 S rRNA transcript containing a unique tandem triple 2'-O-methylated ribose site was used as a substrate. Activity assays demonstrated that this transcript served as a substrate for the nucleolar 2'-O-methyltransferase. The distribution of incorporated methyl groups was determined by hydrolyzing the 2'-O-methylated transcript with RNase followed by chromatography of the digested products on an anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography column. Results showed one unique RNase-resistant 2'-O-methylated product, a tetramer. The position of the tetrameric sequence in the 28 S rRNA transcript was determined using RNase protection analysis which mapped the methylations to a 20-nucleotide region spanning the unique tandem triple 2'-O-methylated ribose site in 28 S rRNA. To confirm the absolute specificity of methylation, direct sequence analysis was carried out on the tandem triple 2'-O-methylated tetramer. The sequence determined for the tetramer, AmGmCmA, corresponded exactly with that reported from in vivo studies. These findings demonstrate that the purified nucleolar 2'-O-methyltransferase can accurately methylate at a specific site of an in vitro derived preribosomal RNA transcript and support the proposed involvement of this nucleolar enzyme in ribosomal RNA maturation."

In the present study we have demonstrated that erythropoietin's signal is transduced rapidly to the cytosol resulting in specific phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Erythropoietin treatment of Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells previously labeled with [32P]orthophosphate results in a rapid increase in phosphorylation of two cytosolic proteins, designated pp96 and pp80, and a decrease in phosphorylation of another protein, designated pp90. The relative molecular mass and pI of pp80 are virtually identical to those reported for the protein kinase C substrate p80, or MARCKS protein. Treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate also increases pp80 but not pp96 phosphorylation, suggesting that erythropoietin triggers a protein kinase C-dependent pathway to pp80 and a protein kinase C-independent pathway to pp96. The effect of erythropoietin on pp96 phosphorylation was also shown in nontransformed erythroid cells isolated from the spleens of phenylhydrazine-treated mice. In contrast, almost no 32P labeling of pp80 or pp90 was detected, and pp80 and pp90 protein were nearly absent from these normal cells. These differences in expression and phosphorylation of erythropoietin-sensitive phosphoproteins may be related to the growth factor independence or dependence of the erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1510300926,"A radiation suicide procedure was used to isolate cells with either constitutive or temperature-sensitive (ts) defects in the receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Mutagen-treated Chinese hamster ovary cells maintained at 34 degrees C (permissive temperature) were shifted to 39.5 degrees C (nonpermissive temperature) for 14-26 h and incubated at 39.5 degrees C for an additional 6-8 h with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate LDL. Wild-type cells internalized this lipoprotein via LDL receptors and accumulated [3H]cholesteryl linoleate (1.5-2 dpm/cell). Radiolysis during 80 days of frozen storage killed most of these cells (radiation suicide). Receptor-deficient cells were identified by screening the surviving cells for their inability to internalize and accumulate 125I-LDL using a replica plating assay. From 3.6 x 10(7) tritium-labeled cells, two clones fell into previously defined constitutive and ts complementation groups (ldlA and ldlG, respectively). Another constitutive and two other ts mutants defined two new complementation groups, ldlI (constitutive) and ldlH (ts). This increases to nine the current number of recessive, LDL receptor-deficient, Chinese hamster ovary complementation groups. All of the mutants with ts defects in LDL endocytosis exhibited ts conditional-lethal phenotypes. At the nonpermissive temperature, the rates of loss of LDL receptor activity (t 1/2 = 10-14 h) were significantly faster than the rates of loss of protein synthesis (t 1/2 greater than 24 h), suggesting that the temperature sensitivity of receptor activity was not simply due to the metabolic collapse of dying cells. Detailed analysis of these new classes of mutants should help define gene products and functions required for LDL receptor activity."
