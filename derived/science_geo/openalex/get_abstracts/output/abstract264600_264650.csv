https://openalex.org/W1979766340,"The (14)C production rate in the upper atmosphere changes with time because the galactic cosmic-ray flux responsible for (14)C production is modulated by the changes in solar wind magnetic properties. The resulting changes in the atmospheric (14)C level are recorded in tree rings and are used to calculate past (14)C production rates from a carbon reservoir model that describes terrestrial carbon exchange between the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. These past (14)C production rate changes are compared with (14)C production rates determined from 20th-century neutron flux measurements, and a theory relating (14)C production and solar variability, as given by geomagnetic Aa indices and sunspot numbers, is developed. This theory takes into account long-term solar changes that were previously neglected. The 860-year (14)C record indicates three episodes when sunspots apparently were absent: A.D. 1654 to 1714 (Maunder minimum), 1416 to 1534 (Spörer minimum), and 1282 to 1342 (Wolf minimum). A less precisely defined minimum occurred near A.D. 1040. The part of this record after A.D. 1645 correlates well with the basic features of the historical record of sunspot numbers. The magnitude of the calculated (14)C production rates points to a further increase in cosmic-ray flux when sunspots are absent. This flux was greatest during the Spörer minimum. A record of approximate sunspot numbers and Aa indices for the current millennium is also presented."

In the presence of some component of the host tissue, up to 40 percent of the labeled algal photosynthate is liberated primarily as glycerol. Excretion of glycerol by the algae in situ and its control and utilization by the host may represent a mechanism by which zooxanthellae contribute to produtctivity of coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2063208753,"Micropaleontological studies of carbonaceous chert from the Fig Tree Series of South Africa (> 3.1 × 109 years old) revealed the presence of spheroidal microfossils, here designated Archaeosphaeroides barbertonensis, interpreted as probably representing the remnants of unicellular alga-like organisms. The presumed photosynthetic nature of these primitive microorganisms seems corroborated by organic geochemical and carbon isotopic studies of the Fig Tree organic matter, and is consistent with the geologically and mineralogically indicated Early Precambrian environment. These alga-like spheroids, together with a bacterium-like organism previously described from the Fig Tree chert, are the oldest fossil organisms now known."

This print allows positive, rapid location of uranium-bearing phases in the rock and accurate determination of uranium abundances."
https://openalex.org/W1991724052,"Mössbauer absorption spectrography can be used to establish the presence of Fe(2)+ and Fe(3)+ in clay minerals. In the sheet structure silicates, octahedrally coordinated iron can be distinguished from tetrahedrally coordinated iron. Siderite and goethite, common contaminants of the clay minerals, can usually be detected. Goethite has a well-organized structure, though, owing to its fine grain size, it may appear to be amorphous to x-rays. The various families of clay minerals show minor differences in isomer shift and quadrupole splitting values, caused by variations in the character of the octahedral layer."
https://openalex.org/W2093874188,"A bathymetric and geophysical survey of the Red Sea rift valley between 21 degrees 10' and 21 degrees 30'N has defined three separate pools of hot brines. The brines and their associated heavy metals are believed to be periodically discharged from the eastern side of the largest deep, Atlantis II. Cores taken from the flanks of the deeps show repetitive cycles of sedimentation of hydrous amorphous iron oxides which fill most of Atlantis II Deep."

https://openalex.org/W2101357488,"Complex structures in Upper Huronian (Lower Proterozoic) quartzite north of Lake Huron are interpreted as probable metazoan fossils aged between 2 and 2.5 × 109 years. They are preserved as sand casts in the form of curved spindles having inclined lateral corrugations, axial marking, and apparent bilateral symmetry."

https://openalex.org/W2017438010,"About 80 percent of women trained in science or engineering are in the labor force, but many are employed outside of their fields. Most who withdraw from the labor force do so temporarily, and about half do not take a career break even when they have small children. Factors affecting labor force participation are student status, highest degree level, parental status and age of children, and field of degree. Employment opportunities are restricted in some fields, and women have higher unemployment rates and lower earnings than men. Some policy changes would improve opportunities for women, and better data are needed to monitor their participation in science and technology."
