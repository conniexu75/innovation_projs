https://openalex.org/W2572951874,"A study of how temperature and water availability fluctuations affect the carbon balance of land ecosystems reveals different controls on local and global scales, implying that spatial climate covariation drives the global carbon cycle response. It has not been clear to what extent temperature and water availability control the yearly variations in the global land carbon sink. Here, Martin Jung et al. have studied the effect of changes in temperature and water availability on gross primary productivity, terrestrial ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem exchange. They reveal that, at the global scale, interannual changes in the land carbon sink are mostly driven by temperature fluctuations, as a result of two compensatory water effects. However, water availability is found to be a predominant driver at the local scale. Large interannual variations in the measured growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) originate primarily from fluctuations in carbon uptake by land ecosystems1,2,3. It remains uncertain, however, to what extent temperature and water availability control the carbon balance of land ecosystems across spatial and temporal scales3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we use empirical models based on eddy covariance data15 and process-based models16,17 to investigate the effect of changes in temperature and water availability on gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at local and global scales. We find that water availability is the dominant driver of the local interannual variability in GPP and TER. To a lesser extent this is true also for NEE at the local scale, but when integrated globally, temporal NEE variability is mostly driven by temperature fluctuations. We suggest that this apparent paradox can be explained by two compensatory water effects. Temporal water-driven GPP and TER variations compensate locally, dampening water-driven NEE variability. Spatial water availability anomalies also compensate, leaving a dominant temperature signal in the year-to-year fluctuations of the land carbon sink. These findings help to reconcile seemingly contradictory reports regarding the importance of temperature and water in controlling the interannual variability of the terrestrial carbon balance3,4,5,6,9,11,12,14. Our study indicates that spatial climate covariation drives the global carbon cycle response."
https://openalex.org/W2572707648,"Andrew Feinberg, Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue and colleagues describe the epigenomic reprogramming that occurs during pancreatic cancer progression. They also show that hematogenous metastases co-evolve a dependence on the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) and that oxPPP inhibition reverses chromatin reprogramming and blocks tumorigenic potential. During the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), heterogeneous subclonal populations emerge that drive primary tumor growth, regional spread, distant metastasis, and patient death. However, the genetics of metastases largely reflects that of the primary tumor in untreated patients, and PDAC driver mutations are shared by all subclones. This raises the possibility that an epigenetic process might operate during metastasis. Here we report large-scale reprogramming of chromatin modifications during the natural evolution of distant metastasis. Changes were targeted to thousands of large chromatin domains across the genome that collectively specified malignant traits, including euchromatin and large organized chromatin histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-modified (LOCK) heterochromatin. Remarkably, distant metastases co-evolved a dependence on the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP), and oxPPP inhibition selectively reversed reprogrammed chromatin, malignant gene expression programs, and tumorigenesis. These findings suggest a model whereby linked metabolic–epigenetic programs are selected for enhanced tumorigenic fitness during the evolution of distant metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2576896693,"Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue and colleagues report a detailed analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from primary and metastatic tumors in four patients with pancreatic cancer. They find that in each patient primary tumors and metastases have identical mutations in known driver genes. The extent of heterogeneity among driver gene mutations present in naturally occurring metastases—that is, treatment-naive metastatic disease—is largely unknown. To address this issue, we carried out 60× whole-genome sequencing of 26 metastases from four patients with pancreatic cancer. We found that identical mutations in known driver genes were present in every metastatic lesion for each patient studied. Passenger gene mutations, which do not have known or predicted functional consequences, accounted for all intratumoral heterogeneity. Even with respect to these passenger mutations, our analysis suggests that the genetic similarity among the founding cells of metastases was higher than that expected for any two cells randomly taken from a normal tissue. The uniformity of known driver gene mutations among metastases in the same patient has critical and encouraging implications for the success of future targeted therapies in advanced-stage disease."
https://openalex.org/W2579374544,"The genome of the Southern Ocean phytoplankton Fragilariopsis cylindrus differs markedly from the genomes of its more temperate relatives, with divergent alleles being differentially expressed in environmentally specific conditions such as freezing and darkness. Diatoms are the main primary producers in the Southern Ocean, but how they have adapted to an environment with such extremes of light and temperature has remained unknown. Here Thomas Mock et al. report the genome sequence of a cold-adapted diatom from the Southern Ocean, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, and compare this 'psychrophile' with diatoms that evolved in temperate oceans. They find that its genome contains highly diverged alleles that are differentially expressed across environmental conditions. The Southern Ocean houses a diverse and productive community of organisms1,2. Unicellular eukaryotic diatoms are the main primary producers in this environment, where photosynthesis is limited by low concentrations of dissolved iron and large seasonal fluctuations in light, temperature and the extent of sea ice3,4,5,6,7. How diatoms have adapted to this extreme environment is largely unknown. Here we present insights into the genome evolution of a cold-adapted diatom from the Southern Ocean, Fragilariopsis cylindrus8,9, based on a comparison with temperate diatoms. We find that approximately 24.7 per cent of the diploid F. cylindrus genome consists of genetic loci with alleles that are highly divergent (15.1 megabases of the total genome size of 61.1 megabases). These divergent alleles were differentially expressed across environmental conditions, including darkness, low iron, freezing, elevated temperature and increased CO2. Alleles with the largest ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions also show the most pronounced condition-dependent expression, suggesting a correlation between diversifying selection and allelic differentiation. Divergent alleles may be involved in adaptation to environmental fluctuations in the Southern Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2579563793,"Underpinning the vision of precision medicine is the concept that causative mutations in a patient's cancer drive its biology and, by extension, its clinical features and treatment response. However, considerable between-patient heterogeneity in driver mutations complicates evidence-based personalization of cancer care. Here, by reanalyzing data from 1,540 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we explore how large knowledge banks of matched genomic-clinical data can support clinical decision-making. Inclusive, multistage statistical models accurately predicted likelihoods of remission, relapse and mortality, which were validated using data from independent patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Comparison of long-term survival probabilities under different treatments enables therapeutic decision support, which is available in exploratory form online. Personally tailored management decisions could reduce the number of hematopoietic cell transplants in patients with AML by 20-25% while maintaining overall survival rates. Power calculations show that databases require information from thousands of patients for accurate decision support. Knowledge banks facilitate personally tailored therapeutic decisions but require sustainable updating, inclusive cohorts and large sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2576072275,"Ashlee Earl and colleagues analyze whole-genome sequences from 5,310 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from five continents. They find that resistance to isoniazid arises before rifampicin resistance across all of the lineages, geographical regions and time periods. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), caused by drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is an increasingly serious problem worldwide. Here we examined a data set of whole-genome sequences from 5,310 M. tuberculosis isolates from five continents. Despite the great diversity of these isolates with respect to geographical point of isolation, genetic background and drug resistance, the patterns for the emergence of drug resistance were conserved globally. We have identified harbinger mutations that often precede multidrug resistance. In particular, the katG mutation encoding p.Ser315Thr, which confers resistance to isoniazid, overwhelmingly arose before mutations that conferred rifampicin resistance across all of the lineages, geographical regions and time periods. Therefore, molecular diagnostics that include markers for rifampicin resistance alone will be insufficient to identify pre-MDR strains. Incorporating knowledge of polymorphisms that occur before the emergence of multidrug resistance, particularly katG p.Ser315Thr, into molecular diagnostics should enable targeted treatment of patients with pre-MDR-TB to prevent further development of MDR-TB."
https://openalex.org/W2543278732,"Stem cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are expected to reach clinical trials soon. Most of the approaches currently under development involve transplantation of immature progenitors that subsequently undergo phenotypic and functional maturation in vivo, and predicting the long-term graft outcome already at the progenitor stage remains a challenge. Here, we took an unbiased approach to identify predictive markers expressed in dopamine neuron progenitors that correlate with graft outcome in an animal model of Parkinson's disease through gene expression analysis of >30 batches of grafted human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived progenitors. We found that many of the commonly used markers did not accurately predict in vivo subtype-specific maturation. Instead, we identified a specific set of markers associated with the caudal midbrain that correlate with high dopaminergic yield after transplantation in vivo. Using these markers, we developed a good manufacturing practice (GMP) differentiation protocol for highly efficient and reproducible production of transplantable dopamine progenitors from hESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2544973020,"Stem cell engineering and grafting of mesencephalic dopamine (mesDA) neurons is a promising strategy for brain repair in Parkinson's disease (PD). Refinement of differentiation protocols to optimize this approach will require deeper understanding of mesDA neuron development. Here, we studied this process using transcriptome-wide single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse neural progenitors expressing the mesDA neuron determinant Lmx1a. This approach resolved the differentiation of mesDA and neighboring neuronal lineages and revealed a remarkably close relationship between developing mesDA and subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons, while also highlighting a distinct transcription factor set that can distinguish between them. While previous hESC mesDA differentiation protocols have relied on markers that are shared between the two lineages, we found that application of these highlighted markers can help to refine current stem cell engineering protocols, increasing the proportion of appropriately patterned mesDA progenitors. Our results, therefore, have important implications for cell replacement therapy in PD."

USA. 2015; 112: 15672-15677Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As these cultures presumably contain a mixture of cell types, single-cell resolution studies are essential to characterize the cell types produced in culture and to determine how they compare to primary developing tissue. Here, we present a study of early human brain cell-type development using single-cell transcriptomics and a two-dimensional in vitro brain development model. We demonstrate the biological relevance of our cell types by comparison to primary tissues from atlas data and cortical cells from mid-gestation human fetal embryos. We computationally identify cell types, predict their lineage relationships using a Bayesian lineage algorithm, and experimentally confirm the predictions using two independent clonal analysis techniques. Our lineage tree captures some of the earliest regional patterning events of the brain, including the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-signaling-dependent separation of cortical from mid/hindbrain cell types and the appearance of forebrain neurons that resemble some of the earliest formed neurons of the brain. These data constitute a deep and broad interrogation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) neural differentiation and highlight key steps in regional patterning and lineage specification. We developed and standardized an in vitro model of human cortical development based on the neuralization of hESCs, adapted from previous protocols (Chambers et al., 2009Chambers S.M. Fasano C.A.

At the end of CI (day 12), pluripotency markers were completely lost, most cells expressed both PAX6 and FOXG1, and 92% ± 3% co-express PAX6 and SOX2, suggesting efficient telencephalic induction (Figures 1B and S1A–S1C). By the end of PE (day 26), 11% ± 2% of cells expressed the cortical intermediate progenitor marker EOMES (TBR2) (Figures 1B and S1D).

In addition, we observed putative glial and outer radial glial cells marked by HOPX and GFAP (Figures 1B and S1E) (Pollen et al., 2015Pollen A.A. Nowakowski T.J. Chen J. Retallack H.

Neuronal activity of day 54 cells was confirmed using calcium imaging and pharmacological blocking experiments with tetrodotoxin (TTX), an action potential generation inhibitor.

We profiled the different stages of our in vitro differentiation protocol and established its reproducibility (Figures 1D and S1B–S1F) across replicate differentiations and cell lines (H1 and H9) by analyzing populations of cells from each time point (∼1 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells per sample) using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, flow cytometry, and immunostaining. Developing cortex markers EMX2, PAX6, and LHX2 appeared between days 6 and 12 (Figures 1E, S1A, and S1G). Additionally, markers of ganglionic eminences (DLX1, ASCL1, and GAD1) as well as mid/hindbrain (EN2, PAX7, and TFAP2B) were observed. Analysis by flow cytometry showed 7% ± 3% of SOX2+ cells lack PAX6 at day 26 (Figure S1A), suggesting non-cortical identity. Immunostaining corroborated the presence of SOX2+PAX6− cells at day 26 as well as the expression of TFAP2B, TH, GAD67, and PBX3 in cultured neurons at day 54 (Figures 1B and S1H). These results indicate a high degree of cellular heterogeneity and led us to transcriptionally profile single in vitro-derived cells through differentiation.

Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) to fuse citrine fluorescent protein to endogenous SOX2 (a marker of progenitors) or DCX (a marker of immature neurons) in order to isolate both live progenitors and neurons (Figure 1F, S2A, and S2B). SOX2Cit/+ cells exhibited near-uniform reporter expression in 93% ± 1% of hESCs (n = 3), which decreased to 51% ± 3% (n = 3) citrine-positive cells by day 54 of differentiation (Figures 1G and S2C). In DCXCit/Y cells, the citrine reporter was not detected in hESCs but increased to 50% ± 8% (n = 6) of cells at day 54. Both reporters mimicked expression of the endogenous protein, and produced neurons with the same markers as the parental H1 line (Figures S2D and S2E). Additionally, reporter lines were generated and validated for the early neurogenesis markers OTX2 and PAX6 (Figures S2F–S2K). These lines constitute an important set of tools for dissecting human neurogenesis. A method based on multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq (CelSeq; Hashimshony et al., 2012Hashimshony T. Wagner F. Sher N. Yanai I. CEL-Seq: single-cell RNA-Seq by multiplexed linear amplification.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 666-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) was used to profile cells at multiple time points (days 0, 12, 19, 26, 40, and 54) (Figure 2A). We isolated both progenitor-enriched (DCXCit− and SOX2Cit+) and neuron-enriched cells (DCXCit+ and SOX2Cit−), resulting in 4,368 cells harvested from two to six independent differentiations per time point (Figures 2B and S3A). We recognized, as others have (Paul et al., 2015Paul F. Arkin Y. Giladi A. Jaitin D.A. Kenigsberg E. Keren-Shaul H. Winter D. Lara-Astiaso D. Gury M. Weiner A. et al.Transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage commitment in myeloid progenitors.Cell. 2015; 163: 1663-1677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), some well-to-well mixing was present that could lead to spurious appearance of cell types or frequencies, and we implemented a strategy that substantially reduced such technical artifacts (Figure S3B; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Following batch correction, we analyzed cells with >20,000 transcripts as assessed by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) (n = 2,684) and normalized the data by subsampling to 20,000 UMIs (Figures S3C and S3D). Single-cell data were evaluated for mapping to genome and transcriptome, inclusion of UMIs represented by single reads, sensitivity, linearity of amplification, number of genes detected, and the 3′ read bias by library (Figures S4A–S4F). We included UMIs represented by only one read, although others have removed them to reduce spurious UMIs (Zeisel et al., 2015Zeisel A. Muñoz-Manchado A.B. Codeluppi S. Lönnerberg P. La Manno G. Juréus A. Marques S. Munguba H. He L. Betsholtz C. et al.Brain structure. Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2015; 347: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar), since we saw no increased fidelity upon their removal (Figure S4B). Principal-component analysis (PCA) separated progenitors and neurons by principal component 1 (PC1) and further separated differentiation phase by PC2 (Figure 2C). Genes with variance greater than technical noise (estimated by External RNA Control Consortium [ERCC] spike-in controls; Figure S4H; Table S1) were used to drive iterative cell clustering at each time point using gene modules derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA; Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B.

Robustness of cell clusters was determined through bootstrapping, where a random 80% of cells from each time point were re-clustered 100 times (Figures 2D and S4I). In total, 41 cell-type clusters were observed: 14 neural progenitor, 5 transitional, 19 neuronal, and 3 non-neural cell types (Figures 2E and 2F). Cell types are named by time point of origin; whether they are a progenitor (P), transitional (T), neuronal (N) or other tissue (O) cell type; and where necessary, the most specifically expressed gene for that cell type (e.g., D54_N_NEUROD6). Lastly, we generated a “constellation diagram” that shows cell types, relative frequency per time point, average co-clustering, and frequency of inter-cluster mixing during bootstrapping analysis (Figure 2F). Within progenitor and neuronal cell types found at and after day 26, we observed co-expression of markers suggestive of telencephalic identity (LHX2, FOXG1, and FEZF2; Hanashima et al., 2004Hanashima C.

At day 26, a progenitor cell type emerged that expressed markers suggestive of mid/hindbrain identity (PTX3 and POU3F2; Figures 2E, 2F, and S5A). At days 40 and 54, we observed additional progenitor and neuronal cell types expressing mid/hindbrain markers such as TFAP2B, PAX3, ROBO3, and HOXB2, but not LHX2 (Figures 2E, 2F, and S5A). Thus, our differentiation method furnishes a combination of forebrain and mid/hindbrain cell types. To independently validate key features of the gene expression data, we generated a dataset using SmartSeq2 (that has no multiplexing of samples; see below) and also conducted immunostaining. By both RNA-seq and immunostaining, LHX2 and POU3F2 showed little expression overlap within neural progenitors at day 26, and this segregation persists within neurons at day 54 (Figures 3A and 3B ). In contrast EOMES and TBR1 are frequently co-expressed in day 26 and day 54 neurons in all datasets (Figures 3C and 3D). To establish the nature of our cell types, we compared our cells to primary brain cell expression datasets. EOMES expression is frequently used as a marker of intermediate progenitor cells (Qian et al., 2016Qian X. Nguyen H.N. Song M.M. Hadiono C. Ogden S.C. Hammack C. Yao B. Hamersky G.R. Jacob F.

Dev. 1999; 84: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Consistently, expression of Eomes and Tbr1 is apparent in the same layer of early-borne mouse neurons at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) and E13.5, but not at E15.5 (Figure 3E). Among genes selectively expressed in LHX2+ rather than POU3F2+ neurons at days 40 and 54, 56% of those present in the Developing Mouse Brain Atlas (Thompson et al., 2014Thompson C.L. Ng L. Menon V.

These data suggest that some cultured neurons correspond to preplate or other early neuronal cell types. We compared the single-cell transcriptomes of day 54 cells to the BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain (Miller et al., 2014Miller J.A. Ding S.L. Sunkin S.M. Smith K.A. Ng L. Szafer A.

Aiona K. et al.Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain.Nature. 2014; 508: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) and the Developing Mouse Brain Atlas. We focused on the conserved co-expressed gene modules identified by WGCNA (Langfelder and Horvath, 2007Langfelder P. Horvath S. Eigengene networks for studying the relationships between co-expression modules.BMC Syst. Biol. 2007; 1: 54Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) that distinguished both the hESC-derived cell types and brain regions (gene modules shown in Table S1). Statistical significance of the assessed conserved gene modules was based on permutation analysis (Langfelder et al., 2011Langfelder P. Luo R. Oldham M.C. Horvath S. Is my network module preserved and reproducible?.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7: e1001057Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). We estimated the similarity between differentiated day 54 neurons and brain regions by comparing the Spearman correlation coefficient based on these conserved co-expressed gene modules (Table S1). Neuron clusters D54_N_NEUROD6 and D54_N_PPP1R17 (marked by LHX2 and TBR1) showed strong correlation to cortex but weak correlation to mid/hindbrain regions in both mouse at E13.5 and human at post-conception week (PCW) 15–16 (Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, POU3F2+ neuron clusters D54_N_HOX5, D54_N_ROBO3, D54_N_KLHL1, and D54_N_ZFHX3 showed weak correlation to cortex but strong correlation to mid/hindbrain, while D54_N_TRH correlated best to diencephalon (forebrain) and midbrain. Finally, neuron cluster D54_N_DLX1 showed high correlation to the ganglionic eminences (Figures 4A and 4B). Antibody staining of human mid-gestational (122–132 days post-conception [dpc]) brain tissue showed that LHX2 is a marker of human cortical, but not hindbrain, progenitors (Figure 4C). Markers associated with the LHX2-expressing neuronal cell types D54_N_NEUROD6, D54_N_PPP1R17, BCL11B+, and NFIA+NeuN+ were highly expressed in the cortical plate and intermediate zone of the cortex, respectively, but not in hindbrain cells (Figure 4D). In contrast, markers of the POU3F2-expressing neuron clusters, TFAP2B and ROBO3, were present in hindbrain, but not cortex (Figure 4D). Thus, the POU3F2-expressing neurons likely correspond to posterior brain neuron types, wh"
https://openalex.org/W2578261095,"Jens Lykke-Andersen, Frank Baas, Joseph Gleeson and colleagues report that mutations in the 3′ exonuclease TOE1 cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 7. They further show that these mutations result in the accumulation of incompletely processed small nuclear RNAs, leading to severe, early-onset neurodegeneration. Deadenylases are best known for degrading the poly(A) tail during mRNA decay. The deadenylase family has expanded throughout evolution and, in mammals, consists of 12 Mg2+-dependent 3′-end RNases with substrate specificity that is mostly unknown1. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 7 (PCH7) is a unique recessive syndrome characterized by neurodegeneration and ambiguous genitalia2. We studied 12 human families with PCH7, uncovering biallelic, loss-of-function mutations in TOE1, which encodes an unconventional deadenylase3,4. toe1-morphant zebrafish displayed midbrain and hindbrain degeneration, modeling PCH-like structural defects in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that TOE1 associated with small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) incompletely processed spliceosomal. These pre-snRNAs contained 3′ genome-encoded tails often followed by post-transcriptionally added adenosines. Human cells with reduced levels of TOE1 accumulated 3′-end-extended pre-snRNAs, and the immunoisolated TOE1 complex was sufficient for 3′-end maturation of snRNAs. Our findings identify the cause of a neurodegenerative syndrome linked to snRNA maturation and uncover a key factor involved in the processing of snRNA 3′ ends."
https://openalex.org/W2575955257,"The huge proportion of child marriage contributes to high rates of pregnancies among adolescent girls in Bangladesh. Despite substantial progress in reducing maternal mortality in the last two decades, the rate of adolescent pregnancy remains high. The use of skilled maternal health services is still low in Bangladesh. Several quantitative studies described the use of skilled maternal health services among adolescent girls. So far, very little qualitative evidence exists about attitudes and practices related to maternal health. To fill this gap, we aimed at exploring maternal health care-seeking behavior of adolescent girls and their experiences related to pregnancy and delivery in Bangladesh.A prospective qualitative study was conducted among thirty married adolescent girls from three Upazilas (sub-districts) of Rangpur district. They were interviewed in two subsequent phases (2014 and 2015). To triangulate and validate the data collected from these married adolescent girls, key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with different stakeholders. Data analysis was guided by the Social-Ecological Model (SEM) including four levels of factors (individual, interpersonal and family, community and social, and organizational and health systems level) which influenced the maternal health care-seeking behavior of adolescent girls. While adolescent girls showed little decision making-autonomy, interpersonal and family level factors played an important role in their use of skilled maternal health services. In addition, community and social factors and as well as organizational and health systems factors shaped adolescent girls' maternal health care-seeking behavior.In order to improve the maternal health of adolescent girls, all four levels of factors of SEM should be taken into account while developing health interventions targeting adolescent girls."
https://openalex.org/W2577681251,"Recent evidence has implicated the transmembrane co-receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in cancer progression. Primarily known as a regulator of neuronal guidance and angiogenesis, NRP1 is also expressed in multiple human malignancies, where it promotes tumor angiogenesis. However, non-angiogenic roles of NRP1 in tumor progression remain poorly characterized. In this study, we define NRP1 as an androgen-repressed gene whose expression is elevated during the adaptation of prostate tumors to androgen-targeted therapies (ATTs), and subsequent progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of NRP1, we demonstrate that NRP1 regulates the mesenchymal phenotype of mCRPC cell models and the invasive and metastatic dissemination of tumor cells in vivo. In patients, immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays and mRNA expression analyses revealed a positive association between NRP1 expression and increasing Gleason grade, pathological T score, positive lymph node status and primary therapy failure. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of several large clinical prostate cancer (PCa) cohorts identified NRP1 expression at radical prostatectomy as an independent prognostic biomarker of biochemical recurrence after radiation therapy, metastasis and cancer-specific mortality. This study identifies NRP1 for the first time as a novel androgen-suppressed gene upregulated during the adaptive response of prostate tumors to ATTs and a prognostic biomarker of clinical metastasis and lethal PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2577503603,"The bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase-4 (PFKFB4) controls metabolic flux through allosteric regulation of glycolysis. Here we show that p53 regulates the expression of PFKFB4 and that p53-deficient cancer cells are highly dependent on the function of this enzyme. We found that p53 downregulates PFKFB4 expression by binding to its promoter and mediating transcriptional repression via histone deacetylases. Depletion of PFKFB4 from p53-deficient cancer cells increased levels of the allosteric regulator fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, leading to increased glycolytic activity but decreased routing of metabolites through the oxidative arm of the pentose-phosphate pathway. PFKFB4 was also required to support the synthesis and regeneration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in p53-deficient cancer cells. Moreover, depletion of PFKFB4-attenuated cellular biosynthetic activity and resulted in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and cell death in the absence of p53. Finally, silencing of PFKFB4-induced apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells in vivo and interfered with tumour growth. These results demonstrate that PFKFB4 is essential to support anabolic metabolism in p53-deficient cancer cells and suggest that inhibition of PFKFB4 could be an effective strategy for cancer treatment."

We assessed the effect of intensive blood pressure (BP) and/or lipid lowering on cognitive outcomes in patients with recent stroke in a pilot trial. Methods In a multicentre, partial-factorial trial, patients with recent stroke, absence of dementia, and systolic BP (SBP) 125–170 mmHg were assigned randomly to at least 6 months of intensive (target SBP <125 mmHg) or guideline (target SBP <140 mmHg) BP lowering. The subset of patients with ischaemic stroke and total cholesterol 3.0–8.0 mmol/l were also assigned randomly to intensive (target LDL-cholesterol <1.3 mmol/l) or guideline (target LDL-c <3.0 mmol/l) lipid lowering. The primary outcome was the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). Results We enrolled 83 patients, mean age 74.0 (6.8) years, and median 4.5 months after stroke. The median follow-up was 24 months (range 1–48). Mean BP was significantly reduced with intensive compared to guideline treatment (difference –10·6/–5·5 mmHg; p<0·01), as was total/LDL-cholesterol with intensive lipid lowering compared to guideline (difference –0·54/–0·44 mmol/l; p<0·01). The ACE-R score during treatment did not differ for either treatment comparison; mean difference for BP lowering -3.6 (95% CI -9.7 to 2.4), and lipid lowering 4.4 (95% CI -2.1 to 10.9). However, intensive lipid lowering therapy was significantly associated with improved scores for ACE-R at 6 months, trail making A, modified Rankin Scale and Euro-Qol Visual Analogue Scale. There was no difference in rates of dementia or serious adverse events for either comparison. Conclusion In patients with recent stroke and normal cognition, intensive BP and lipid lowering were feasible and safe, but did not alter cognition over two years. The association between intensive lipid lowering and improved scores for some secondary outcomes suggests further trials are warranted. Trial Registration ISRCTN ISRCTN85562386"
https://openalex.org/W2578611388,"Abstract Aberrant regulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling has a crucial role in the onset and progression of cancers, where the effects are not always predictable depending on tumor context. In melanoma, for example, models of the disease predict differing effects of the WNT/β-catenin pathway on metastatic progression. Understanding the processes that underpin the highly context-dependent nature of WNT/β-catenin signaling in tumors is essential to achieve maximal therapeutic benefit from WNT inhibitory compounds. In this study, we have found that expression of the tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), alters the invasive potential of melanoma cells in response to WNT/β-catenin signaling, correlating with differing metabolic profiles. This alters the bioenergetic potential and mitochondrial activity of melanoma cells, triggered through regulation of pro-survival autophagy. Thus, WNT/β-catenin signaling is a regulator of catabolic processes in cancer cells, which varies depending on the metabolic requirements of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2576881285,"Genome editing using transcription-activator like effector nucleases or RNA guided nucleases allows one to precisely engineer desired changes within a given target sequence. The genome editing reagents introduce double stranded breaks (DSBs) at the target site which can then undergo DNA repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed recombination (HDR) when a template DNA molecule is available. NHEJ repair results in indel mutations at the target site. As PCR amplified products from mutant target regions are likely to exhibit different melting profiles than PCR products amplified from wild type target region, we designed a high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) for rapid identification of efficient genome editing reagents. We also designed TaqMan assays using probes situated across the cut site to discriminate wild type from mutant sequences present after genome editing. The experiments revealed that the sensitivity of the assays to detect NHEJ-mediated DNA repair could be enhanced by selection of transfected cells to reduce the contribution of unmodified genomic DNA from untransfected cells to the DNA melting profile. The presence of donor template DNA lacking the target sequence at the time of genome editing further enhanced the sensitivity of the assays for detection of mutant DNA molecules by excluding the wild-type sequences modified by HDR. A second TaqMan probe that bound to an adjacent site, outside of the primary target cut site, was used to directly determine the contribution of HDR to DNA repair in the presence of the donor template sequence. The TaqMan qPCR assay, designed to measure the contribution of NHEJ and HDR in DNA repair, corroborated the results from HRMA. The data indicated that genome editing reagents can produce DSBs at high efficiency in HEK293T cells but a significant proportion of these are likely masked by reversion to wild type as a result of HDR. Supplying a donor plasmid to provide a template for HDR (that eliminates a PCR amplifiable target) revealed these cryptic DSBs and facilitated the determination of the true efficacy of genome editing reagents. The results indicated that in HEK293T cells, approximately 40% of the DSBs introduced by genome editing, were available for participation in HDR."
https://openalex.org/W2575478987,"Variation in host responses to pathogens can have cascading effects on populations and communities when some individuals or groups of individuals display disproportionate vulnerability to infection or differ in their competence to transmit infection. The fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been detected in almost 700 different amphibian species and is implicated in numerous global amphibian population declines. Identifying key hosts in the amphibian-Bd system–those who are at greatest risk or who pose the greatest risk for others–is challenging due in part to many extrinsic environmental factors driving spatiotemporal Bd distribution and context-dependent host responses to Bd in the wild. One way to improve predictive risk models and generate testable mechanistic hypotheses about vulnerability is to complement what we know about the spatial epidemiology of Bd with data collected through comparative experimental studies. We used standardized pathogen challenges to quantify amphibian survival and infection trajectories across 20 post-metamorphic North American species raised from eggs. We then incorporated trait-based models to investigate the predictive power of phylogenetic history, habitat use, and ecological and life history traits in explaining responses to Bd. True frogs (Ranidae) displayed the lowest infection intensities, whereas toads (Bufonidae) generally displayed the greatest levels of mortality after Bd exposure. Affiliation with ephemeral aquatic habitat and breadth of habitat use were strong predictors of vulnerability to and intensity of infection and several other traits including body size, lifespan, age at sexual maturity, and geographic range also appeared in top models explaining host responses to Bd. Several of the species examined are highly understudied with respect to Bd such that this study represents the first experimental susceptibility data. Combining insights gained from experimental studies with observations of landscape-level disease prevalence may help explain current and predict future pathogen dynamics in the Bd system."

In this study, we report the emergence, mixed infection, and genetic characterization of 15 novel field PEDV variants with large genomic deletions. The sizes of deletion varied between 582 nt (194 aa) and 648 nt (216 aa) at positions 28–714 (10–238) on the S gene (protein). Among 17 PEDV samples isolated from individual pigs, all of them contained at least two distinct genotypes with large genomic deletions, and 94.1% of them were found to consist of strains with an intact S gene. These variants were found in eight primary and nine recurrent outbreaks, and they might be associated with persistent PEDV infection in the farms. Full-length S and ORF3 genes of eight variants derived from 2 samples were characterized. This is the first report of mixed infections caused by various genotypes of PEDV and would be important for the studies of viral isolation, pathogenesis, and molecular epidemiology of the disease."

The present study was conducted to provide the current baseline data on prevalence of IPIs, anaemia, malnutrition and associated risk factors among the indigenous communities in Sarawak, situation at northwest Borneo island of Malaysia. A cross sectional study was conducted among the longhouses communities. Stool samples were obtained and examined for the presence of IPIs using microscopy technique. Haemoglobin measurement was done using a portable haemoglobin analyzer. Malnutrition (i.e., stunting, underweight and wasting) was assessed using the WHO Anthro software. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software. A total of 341participants took part in this study. The overall prevalence of IPIs was 57.5%. Multivariate analysis indicated that the absence of toilets (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1–2.7; p = 0.002) and close contact with animals (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.3–2.9; p = 0.027) as significant predictors for IPIs. The incidence of anaemia was 36.4%. The incidence of underweight, wasting and stunting were 22.2%, 5.6% and 35.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low level of parental education attainment (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.2–3.0; p = 0.006) was identified as significant predictor for anaemia. The incidence of wasting was significantly associated with mild anaemia (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.9–1.7; p = 0.024). Low household income was identified as significant predictor for stunting (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 9.8–22.2; p = 0.001) and underweight (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 5.6–18.7; p = 0.037), respectively. Essentially, the present study highlighted that intestinal parasitic infections, anaemia and malnutrition are still prevalent among rural indigenous community in Sarawak. Improvement of socioeconomic status, periodic mass deworming, iron supplementation and health education program should be included in the control and prevention of public health strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2579390626,"Tree mortality due to warming and drought is a critical aspect of forest ecosystem in responding to climate change. Spatial patterns of tree mortality induced by drought and its influencing factors, however, have yet to be documented at the global scale. We collected observations from 248 sites globally where trees have died due to drought and then assessed the effects of climatic and forest factors on the rate of tree mortality. The global mean annual mortality rate was 5.5%. The rate of tree mortality was significantly and negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation (P < 0.01). Tree mortality was lowest in tropical rainforests with mean annual precipitation >2000 mm and was severe in regions with mean annual precipitation <1000 mm. Mortality rates varied amongst species. The global annual rate of mortality was much higher for gymnosperms (7.1%) than angiosperms (4.8%) but did not differ significantly between evergreen (6.2%) and deciduous (6.1%) species. Stand age and wood density affected the mortality rate. Saplings (4.6%) had a higher mortality rate than mature trees (3.2%), and mortality rates significantly decreased with increasing wood density for all species (P < 0.01). We therefore concluded that the tree mortality around the globe varied with climatic and forest factors. The differences between tree species, wood density, stand density, and stand age should be considered when evaluating tree mortality at a large spatial scale during future climatic extremes."
https://openalex.org/W2576039938,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a member of the Birnaviridae family, is responsible for a devastating immunosuppressive disease affecting juvenile domestic chickens. IBDV particles are naked icosahedrons enclosing a bipartite double-stranded RNA genome harboring three open reading frames (ORF). One of these ORFs codes for VP5, a non-structural polypeptide dispensable for virus replication in tissue culture but essential for IBDV pathogenesis. Using two previously described recombinant viruses, whose genomes differ in a single nucleotide, expressing or not the VP5 polypeptide, we have analyzed the role of this polypeptide during the IBDV replication process. Here, we show that VP5 is not involved in house-keeping steps of the virus replication cycle; i.e. genome transcription/replication, protein translation and virus assembly. Although infection with the VP5 expressing and non-expressing viruses rendered similar intracellular infective progeny yields, striking differences were detected on the ability of their progenies to exiting infected cells. Experimental data shows that the bulk of the VP5-expressing virus progeny efficiently egresses infected cells during the early phase of the infection, when viral metabolism is peaking and virus-induced cell death rates are as yet minimal, as determined by qPCR, radioactive protein labeling and quantitative real-time cell death analyses. In contrast, the release of the VP5-deficient virus progeny is significantly abridged and associated to cell death. Taken together, data presented in this report show that IBDV uses a previously undescribed VP5-dependent non-lytic egress mechanism significantly enhancing the virus dissemination speed. Ultrastructural analyses revealed that newly assembled IBDV virions associate to a vesicular network apparently facilitating their trafficking from virus assembly factories to the extracellular milieu, and that this association requires the expression of the VP5 polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2575594193,"Melanoma tumors usually retain wild-type p53; however, its tumor-suppressor activity is functionally disabled, most commonly through an inactivating interaction with mouse double-minute 2 homolog (Mdm2), indicating p53 release from this complex as a potential therapeutic approach. P53 and the tumor-promoter insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) compete as substrates for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, making their relative abundance intricately linked. Hence we investigated the effects of pharmacological Mdm2 release from the Mdm2/p53 complex on the expression and function of the IGF-1R. Nutlin-3 treatment increased IGF-1R/Mdm2 association with enhanced IGF-1R ubiquitination and a dual functional outcome: receptor downregulation and selective downstream signaling activation confined to the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. This Nutlin-3 functional selectivity translated into IGF-1-mediated bioactivities with biphasic effects on the proliferative and metastatic phenotype: an early increase and late decrease in the number of proliferative and migratory cells, while the invasiveness was completely inhibited following Nutlin-3 treatment through an impaired IGF-1-mediated matrix metalloproteinases type 2 activation mechanism. Taken together, these experiments reveal the biased agonistic properties of Nutlin-3 for the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, mediated by Mdm2 through IGF-1R ubiquitination and provide fundamental insights into destabilizing p53/Mdm2/IGF-1R circuitry that could be developed for therapeutic gain."
https://openalex.org/W2575984014,"Multiple signaling pathways that promote tumor cell metastasis are differentially activated in low/non-metastatic and metastatic tumor cells, resulting in the differential expression of metastasis-related genes. The underlying mechanism may involve the alterations of the intrinsic negative regulation in tumor cells. Here we report that the differential expression of interleukin-37b (IL-37b) in tumor cells alters the intrinsic negative regulation of signaling pathways, resulting in the difference of metastatic capacity. IL-37b could bind Smad3 and suppress Smad pathway by interfering with the formation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3/4 complex. In turn, Smad3 could function as a co-regulator, enabling IL-37b to suppress multiple non-Smad pathways. IL-37b-Smad3 translocated into nucleus to upregulate the expression of non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPNs), thus promoting dephosphorylation to suppress the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways such as ERK, p38 MAPK, JNK, PI3K, NF-κB, and STAT3 pathways. Intriguingly, 13 of 17 PTPNs, most of which are metastasis suppressors, were downregulated in metastatic tumor cells because of the low expression of IL-37b. The marked decrease of intracellular IL-37b attenuated the intrinsic negative regulation in tumor cells, resulting in the enhanced activation of multiple signaling pathways and the increased capacity of invasiveness and metastatic colonization. Consistently, low expression of IL-37b in tumors was significantly associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. Taken together, these findings reveal that intracellular IL-37b is a critical factor in the negative regulation of multiple signaling pathways that modulate the expression of metastasis-related genes, and suggest that IL-37b expression in tumor cells can potentially be a histopathological prognostic parameter for cancer patients and a therapeutic target for preventing tumor metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2576843518,"Pregnant women with diabetes may have underlying beta cell dysfunction due to mutations/rare variants in genes associated with Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). MODY gene screening would reveal those women genetically predisposed and previously unrecognized with a monogenic form of diabetes for further clinical management, family screening and genetic counselling. However, there are minimal data available on MODY gene variants in pregnant women with diabetes from India. In this study, utilizing the Next generation sequencing (NGS) based protocol fifty subjects were screened for variants in a panel of thirteen MODY genes. Of these subjects 18% (9/50) were positive for definite or likely pathogenic or uncertain MODY variants. The majority of these variants was identified in subjects with autosomal dominant family history, of whom five were in women with pre-GDM and four with overt-GDM. The identified variants included one patient with HNF1A Ser3Cys, two PDX1 Glu224Lys, His94Gln, two NEUROD1 Glu59Gln, Phe318Ser, one INS Gly44Arg, one GCK, one ABCC8 Arg620Cys and one BLK Val418Met variants. In addition, three of the seven offspring screened were positive for the identified variant. These identified variants were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In conclusion, these findings in pregnant women with diabetes, imply that a proportion of GDM patients with autosomal dominant family history may have MODY. Further NGS based comprehensive studies with larger samples are required to confirm these finding."
https://openalex.org/W2573258573,"Due to the ubiquity of mobile phones around the globe, studies are beginning to analyze their influence on health. Prior work from developed countries highlights negative mental health outcomes related to overuse of mobile phones. However, there is little work on mental health impacts of mobile phone use or ownership in developing countries. This is an important gap to address because there are likely variations in mental health impacts of mobile phones between developing and developed countries, due to cultural nuances to phone use and distinct variations in financial models for obtaining mobile phone access in developing countries. To address this gap, this study analyzes survey data from 92 households in sparse, rural villages in Uganda to test two hypotheses about mobile phone ownership and mental health in a developing country context: (i) Mobile phone ownership is higher among more privileged groups, compared to less privileged groups (ie, wealth and ethnicity); and (ii) mobile phone ownership is positively associated with a culturally-relevant indicator of mental health, 'feelings of peace'. Results indicate that households with mobile phones had higher levels of wealth on average, yet no significant differences were detected by ethnicity. As hypothesized, mobile phone ownership was associated with increased mental well-being for persons without family nearby (in the District) (p = 0.038) after adjusting for wealth, ethnicity and amount of land for crops and land for grazing. Mobile phone ownership was not significantly associated with increased mental well-being for persons with family nearby. These findings are consistent with studies of mobile phone use in other sub-Saharan African countries which find that phones are important tools for social connection and are thus beneficial for maintaining family ties. One might infer then that this increased feeling of mental well-being for persons located farther from family stems from the ability to maintain family connections. These findings are quite different from work in developed countries where mobile phone use is a source of technology-related stress or technostress."
https://openalex.org/W2574716662,"Background Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after bridging thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is a devastating complication. We aimed to assess whether the additional administration of aspirin during endovascular intervention increases bleeding rates. Methods We retrospectively compared bleeding complications and outcome in stroke patients who received bridging thrombolysis with (tPA+ASA) and without (tPA-ASA) aspirin during endovascular intervention between November 2008 and March 2014. Furthermore, we analyzed bleeding complications and outcome in antiplatelet naïve patients with those with prior or acute antiplatelet therapy. Results Baseline characteristics, previous medication, and dosage of rtPA did not differ between 50 tPA+ASA (39 aspirin naïve, 11 preloaded) and 181 tPA-ASA patients (p>0.05). tPA+ASA patients had more often internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion (p<0.001), large artery disease (p<0.001) and received more often acute stenting of the ICA (p<0.001). 10/180 (5.6%) tPA-ASA patients and 3/49 (6.1%) tPA+ASA patients suffered a sICH (p = 1.0). Rates of asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic bleeding complications and outcome did not differ between both groups (p>0.1). There were no differences in bleeding complications and mortality among 112 bridging patients with antiplatelet therapy (62 preloaded, 39 acute administration, 11 both) and 117 antiplatelet naïve patients. In a logistic regression analysis, aspirin administration during endovascular procedure was not a predictor of sICH. Conclusion Antiplatelet therapy before or during bridging thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke did not increase the risk of bleeding complications and had no impact on outcome. This finding has to be confirmed in larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W2573793075,"Lyme disease is a major vector-borne bacterial disease in the USA. The disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, and transmitted among hosts and humans, primarily by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). The ~25 B. burgdorferi genotypes, based on genotypic variation of their outer surface protein C (ospC), can be phenotypically separated as strains that primarily cause human diseases—human invasive strains (HIS)—or those that rarely do. Additionally, the genotypes are non-randomly associated with host species. The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which phenotypic outcomes of B. burgdorferi could be explained by the host communities fed upon by blacklegged ticks. In 2006 and 2009, we determined the host community composition based on abundance estimates of the vertebrate hosts, and collected host-seeking nymphal ticks in 2007 and 2010 to determine the ospC genotypes within infected ticks. We regressed instances of B. burgdorferi phenotypes on site-specific characteristics of host communities by constructing Bayesian hierarchical models that properly handled missing data. The models provided quantitative support for the relevance of host composition on Lyme disease risk pertaining to B. burgdorferi prevalence (i.e. overall nymphal infection prevalence, or NIPAll) and HIS prevalence among the infected ticks (NIPHIS). In each year, NIPAll and NIPHIS was found to be associated with host relative abundances and diversity. For mice and chipmunks, the association with NIPAll was positive, but tended to be negative with NIPHIS in both years. However, the direction of association between shrew relative abundance with NIPAll or NIPHIS differed across the two years. And, diversity (H') had a negative association with NIPAll, but positive association with NIPHIS in both years. Our analyses highlight that the relationships between the relative abundances of three primary hosts and the community diversity with NIPAll, and NIPHIS, are variable in time and space, and that disease risk inference, based on the role of host community, changes when we examine risk overall or at the phenotypic level. Our discussion focuses on the observed relationships between prevalence and host community characteristics and how they substantiate the ecological understanding of phenotypic Lyme disease risk."

https://openalex.org/W2578210191,"Large cancer projects measure somatic mutations in thousands of samples, gradually assembling a catalog of recurring mutations in cancer. Many methods analyze these data jointly with auxiliary information with the aim of identifying subtype-specific results. Here, we show that somatic gene mutations alone can reliably and specifically predict cancer subtypes. Interpretation of the classifiers provides useful insights for several biomedical applications. We analyze the COSMIC database, which collects somatic mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as well as from many smaller scale studies. We use multi-label classification techniques and the Disease Ontology hierarchy in order to identify cancer subtype-specific biomarkers. Cancer subtype classifiers based on TCGA and the smaller studies have comparable performance, and the smaller studies add a substantial value in terms of validation, coverage of additional subtypes, and improved classification. The gene sets of the classifiers are used for threefold contribution. First, we refine the associations of genes to cancer subtypes and identify novel compelling candidate driver genes. Second, using our classifiers we successfully predict the primary site of metastatic samples. Third, we provide novel hypotheses regarding detection of subtype-specific synthetic lethality interactions. From the cancer research community perspective, our results suggest that curation efforts, such as COSMIC, have great added and complementary value even in the era of large international cancer projects."

https://openalex.org/W2571744805,"Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype is a major factor leading to many human cancers. Mechanisms of HPV entry into host cells and genome trafficking towards the nucleus are incompletely understood. Dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) was identified as a cellular gene required for HPV infection in HeLa cells on a siRNA screen study. Here, we confirm that DCT knockdown significantly decreases HPV infection in the human keratinocyte HaCaT cells as was observed in HeLas. We investigated the effects of DCT knockdown and found that DCT depletion caused increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, DNA damage and altered cell cycle in HaCaT cells. We observed increased viral DNA localization at the endoplasmic reticulum but an overall decrease in infection in DCT knockdown cells. This observation suggests that viral DNA might be retained in the ER due to altered cell cycle, and viral particles are incapable of further movement towards the nucleus in DCT knockdown cells."
https://openalex.org/W2577696934,"A moving model test method based on stagnation pressure measurements is proposed to measure the train aerodynamic drag coefficient. Because the front tip of a high-speed train has a high pressure area and because a stagnation point occurs in the center of this region, the pressure of the stagnation point is equal to the dynamic pressure of the sensor tube based on the obtained train velocity. The first derivation of the train velocity is taken to calculate the acceleration of the train model ejected by the moving model system without additional power. According to Newton's second law, the aerodynamic drag coefficient can be resolved through many tests at different train speeds selected within a relatively narrow range. Comparisons are conducted with wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations, and good agreement is obtained, with differences of less than 6.1%. Therefore, the moving model test method proposed in this paper is feasible and reliable."
https://openalex.org/W2572331534,"We have previously reported that the absence of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) affects both dengue virus (DENV) infection and innate immune responses in vitro. Here we aimed to define SK1-dependancy of DENV-induced disease and the associated innate responses in vivo. The lack of a reliable mouse model with a fully competent interferon response for DENV infection is a challenge, and here we use an experimental model of DENV infection in the brain of immunocompetent mice. Intracranial injection of DENV-2 into C57BL/6 mice induced body weight loss and neurological symptoms which was associated with a high level of DENV RNA in the brain. Body weight loss and DENV RNA level tended to be greater in SK1-/- compared with wildtype (WT) mice. Brain infection with DENV-2 is associated with the induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression including viperin, Ifi27l2a, IRF7, and CXCL10 without any significant differences between WT and SK1-/- mice. The SK2 and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels in the brain were unchanged by DENV infection or the lack of SK1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of a cellular infiltrate in DENV-infected brain with a significant increase in mRNA for CD8 but not CD4 suggesting this infiltrate is likely CD8+ but not CD4+ T-lymphocytes. This increase in T-cell infiltration was not affected by the lack of SK1. Overall, DENV-infection in the brain induces IFN and T-cell responses but does not influence the SK/S1P axis. In contrast to our observations in vitro, SK1 has no major influence on these responses following DENV-infection in the mouse brain."
https://openalex.org/W2572399462,"Lysine decarboxylase (LDC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of l-lysine to produce cadaverine, an important industrial platform chemical for bio-based polyamides. However, due to high flexibility at the pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) binding site, use of the enzyme for cadaverine production requires continuous supplement of large amounts of PLP. In order to develop an LDC enzyme from Selenomonas ruminantium (SrLDC) with an enhanced affinity for PLP, we introduced an internal disulfide bond between Ala225 and Thr302 residues with a desire to retain the PLP binding site in a closed conformation. The SrLDCA225C/T302C mutant showed a yellow color and the characteristic UV/Vis absorption peaks for enzymes with bound PLP, and exhibited three-fold enhanced PLP affinity compared with the wild-type SrLDC. The mutant also exhibited a dramatically enhanced LDC activity and cadaverine conversion particularly under no or low PLP concentrations. Moreover, introduction of the disulfide bond rendered SrLDC more resistant to high pH and temperature. The formation of the introduced disulfide bond and the maintenance of the PLP binding site in the closed conformation were confirmed by determination of the crystal structure of the mutant. This study shows that disulfide bond-mediated spatial reconstitution can be a platform technology for development of enzymes with enhanced PLP affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2573011923,"The tumour suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that controls cellular stress responses. Here, we dissected the transcriptional programmes triggered upon restoration of p53 in Myc-driven lymphomas, based on the integrated analysis of p53 genomic occupancy and gene regulation. p53 binding sites were identified at promoters and enhancers, both characterized by the pre-existence of active chromatin marks. Only a small fraction of these sites showed the 20 base-pair p53 consensus motif, suggesting that p53 recruitment to genomic DNA was primarily mediated through protein-protein interactions in a chromatin context. p53 also targeted distal sites devoid of activation marks, at which binding was prevalently driven by sequence recognition. In all instances, the relevant motif was the canonical unsplit consensus element, with no clear evidence for p53 recruitment by split motifs. At promoters, p53 binding to the consensus motif was associated with gene induction, but not repression, indicating that the latter was most likely indirect. Altogether, our data highlight key features of genome recognition by p53 and provide unprecedented insight into the pathways associated with p53 reactivation and tumour regression, paving the way for their therapeutic application."

This study aimed to determine the best ECG electrodes positioning method and the most reliable calculation of mean cardiac axis (MEA) in equines.We evaluated the electrocardiographic profile of 53 clinically healthy Thoroughbreds, 38 males and 15 females, with ages ranging 2-7 years old, all reared at the São Paulo Jockey Club, in Brazil. Two ECG tracings were recorded from each animal, one using the Dubois lead positioning system, the second using the base-apex method. QRS complex amplitudes were analyzed to obtain MEA values in the frontal plane for each of the two electrode positioning methods mentioned above, using two calculation approaches, the first by Tilley tables and the second by trigonometric calculation. Results were compared between the two methods.There was significant difference in cardiac axis values: MEA obtained by the Tilley tables was +135.1° ± 90.9° vs. -81.1° ± 3.6° (p<0.0001), and by trigonometric calculation it was -15.0° ± 11.3° vs. -79.9° ± 7.4° (p<0.0001), base-apex and Dubois, respectively. Furthermore, Dubois method presented small range of variation without statistical or clinical difference by either calculation mode, while there was a wide variation in the base-apex method.Dubois improved centralization of the Thoroughbreds' hearts, engendering what seems to be the real frontal plane. By either calculation mode, it was the most reliable methodology to obtain cardiac mean electrical axis in equines."

Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secreting T helper (Th1) and IL-17 secreting T helper (Th17) cells are critical for several autoimmune diseases. To assess the inhibitory effect of a given compound on autoimmune disease, we screened many compounds with an in vitro Th differentiation assay. BJ-3105, a 6-alkoxypyridin-3-ol analog, inhibited IFN-γ and IL-17 production from polyclonal CD4+ T cells and ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD4+ T cells which were activated by T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. BJ-3105 ameliorated the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model by reducing Th1 and Th17 generation. Notably, Th cell differentiation was significantly suppressed by BJ-3105 treatment without inhibiting in vitro proliferation of T cells or inducing programmed cell death. Mechanistically, BJ-3105 inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK and its downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) that is critical for Th differentiation. These results demonstrated that BJ-3105 inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT in response to cytokine signals and subsequently suppressed the differentiation of Th cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2572481580,"Identification of epitopes targeted by antibodies (B cell epitopes) is of critical importance for the development of many diagnostic and therapeutic tools. For clinical usage, such epitopes must be extensively characterized in order to validate specificity and to document potential cross-reactivity. B cell epitopes are typically classified as either linear epitopes, i.e. short consecutive segments from the protein sequence or conformational epitopes adapted through native protein folding. Recent advances in high-density peptide microarrays enable high-throughput, high-resolution identification and characterization of linear B cell epitopes. Using exhaustive amino acid substitution analysis of peptides originating from target antigens, these microarrays can be used to address the specificity of polyclonal antibodies raised against such antigens containing hundreds of epitopes. However, the interpretation of the data provided in such large-scale screenings is far from trivial and in most cases it requires advanced computational and statistical skills. Here, we present an online application for automated identification of linear B cell epitopes, allowing the non-expert user to analyse peptide microarray data. The application takes as input quantitative peptide data of fully or partially substituted overlapping peptides from a given antigen sequence and identifies epitope residues (residues that are significantly affected by substitutions) and visualize the selectivity towards each residue by sequence logo plots. Demonstrating utility, the application was used to identify and address the antibody specificity of 18 linear epitope regions in Human Serum Albumin (HSA), using peptide microarray data consisting of fully substituted peptides spanning the entire sequence of HSA and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-HSA (and mouse anti-rabbit-Cy3).

https://openalex.org/W2573507933,"Background Although dementia is associated with both global and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes, little is known about cerebral perfusion in the early pre-clinical stages of cognitive decline preceding overt cognitive dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of early sub-clinical cognitive decline with CBF. Materials and Methods The study participants were recruited from a cohort of Danish men born in 1953. Based on a regression model we selected men who performed better (Group A, n = 94) and poorer (Group B, n = 95) on cognitive testing at age 57 than expected from testing at age 20. Participants underwent supplementary cognitive testing, blood sampling and MRI including measurements of regional and global CBF. Results Regional CBF was lower in group B than in group A in the posterior cingulate gyrus and the precuneus. The associations were attenuated when corrected for global atrophy, but remained significant in regions of interest based analysis adjusting for regional gray matter volume and vascular risk factors. No influence of group on global CBF was observed. Conclusions We conclude that early sub-clinical cognitive decline is associated with reduced perfusion in the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus independently of regional atrophy and vascular risk factors, but cannot be statistically separated from an association with global atrophy."

However, monitoring the humoral immune system after transplantation with standard techniques in the clinical routine is imprecise. Here, we performed sequencing of mononuclear bone marrow cells to characterize the VH1-repertoire of switched B cells of healthy volunteers and patients undergoing HSCT. Analysis of healthy bone marrow donors and patients showed virtually no clonally related sequences between individuals. Interestingly, clonally related sequences were present in pre- and post-transplantation bone marrow of patients undergoing HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia treatment. We consistently observed such related B cell clones, irrespective of conditioning regimen, donor source or time post transplantation. In general, repertoire diversity was lower in post-HSCT as compared to pre-HSCT samples. However, post-HSCT repertoires retained highly mutated sequences, despite immunosuppressive therapy and presence of T cell deficiency after HSCT. These observations identify key properties of the recovering B cell compartment and provide a conceptual framework for the surveillance of humoral immunity after allogeneic transplantation."

Rapid and reliable diagnostic tests are therefore essential to identify infections and to guide the appropriate clinical responses at the point-of-care. Existing tools, including RT-PCR and enzyme immunoassays, pose several limitations based on the significant time, equipment and expertise required to elicit results. Immunochromatographic assays available for use at the point-of-care have poor sensitivity and specificity, especially for genogroup I noroviruses, thus requiring confirmation of results with more sensitive testing methods. Therefore, there is a clear need for novel reagents to help achieve quick and reliable results. In this study, we have identified two novel single-chain antibodies (scFvs)-named NJT-R3-A2 and NJT-R3-A3-that effectively detect GI.1 and GI.7 virus-like particles (VLPs) through selection of a phage display library against the P-domain of the GI.1 major capsid protein. The limits of detection by each scFv for GI.1 and GI.7 are 0.1 and 0.2 ng, and 6.25 and 25 ng, respectively. They detect VLPs with strong specificity in multiple diagnostic formats, including ELISAs and membrane-based dot blots, and in the context of norovirus-negative stool suspensions. The scFvs also detect native virions effectively in norovirus-positive clinical stool samples. Purified scFvs bind to GI.1 and GI.7 VLPs with equilibrium constant (KD) values of 27 nM and 49 nM, respectively. Overall, the phage-based scFv reagents identified and characterized here show utility for detecting GI.1 and GI.7 noroviruses in multiple diagnostic assay formats with strong specificity and sensitivity, indicating promise for integration into existing point-of-care tests to improve future diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2577801454,"Background In terminal failing hearts ventricular assist devices (VAD) are implanted as a bridge to transplantation. Endothelin receptor (ETR) antagonists are used for treatment of secondary pulmonary hypertension in VAD patients. However, the cardiac ETR regulation in human heart failure and during VAD support is incompletely understood. Methods In paired left ventricular samples of 12 dilated cardiomyopathy patients we investigated the density of endothelin A (ETA) and B (ETB) receptors before VAD implantation and after device removal. Left ventricular samples of 12 non-failing donor hearts served as control. Receptor quantification was performed by binding of [125I]-ET-1 in the presence of nonselective and ETA selective ETR ligands as competitors. Additionally, the ETR mRNA expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time-PCR. Results The mRNA of ETA but not ETB receptors was significantly elevated in heart failure, whereas total ETR density analyzed by radioligand binding was significantly reduced due to ETB receptor down regulation. ETA and ETB receptor density showed poor correlation to mRNA data (spearman correlation factor: 0.43 and 0.31, respectively). VAD support had no significant impact on the density of both receptors and on mRNA expression of ETA whereas ETB mRNA increased during VAD. A meta-analysis reveals that the ETA receptor regulation in human heart failure appears to depend on non-failing hearts. Conclusions In deteriorating hearts of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy the ETA receptor density is not changed whereas the ETB receptor is down regulated. The mRNA and the proteins of ETA and ETB show a weak correlation. Non-failing hearts might influence the interpretation of ETA receptor regulation. Mechanical unloading of the failing hearts has no impact on the myocardial ETR density."
