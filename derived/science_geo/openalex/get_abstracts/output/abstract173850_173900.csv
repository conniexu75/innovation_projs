https://openalex.org/W2109794889,"Recent reports have suggested that mammalian stem cells residing in one tissue may have the capacity to produce differentiated cell types for other tissues and organs 1-9. Here we define a mechanism by which progenitor cells of the central nervous system can give rise to non-neural derivatives. Cells taken from mouse brain were co-cultured with pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Following selection for a transgenic marker carried only by the brain cells, undifferentiated stem cells are recovered in which the brain cell genome has undergone epigenetic reprogramming. However, these cells also carry a transgenic marker and chromosomes derived from the embryonic stem cells. Therefore the altered phenotype does not arise by direct conversion of brain to embryonic stem cell but rather through spontaneous generation of hybrid cells. The tetraploid hybrids exhibit full pluripotent character, including multilineage contribution to chimaeras. We propose that transdetermination consequent to cell fusion 10 could underlie many observations otherwise attributed to an intrinsic plasticity of tissue stem cells 9."

The head domain of talin binds to several integrin β tails and activates integrins. This head domain contains a predicted FERM domain composed of three subdomains (F1, F2, and F3). An integrin-activating talin fragment was predicted to contain the F2 and F3 subdomains. Both isolated subdomains bound specifically to the integrin β3 tail. However, talin F3 bound the β3 tail with a 4-fold higher affinity than talin F2. Furthermore, expression of talin F3 (but not F2) in cells led to activation of integrin αIIbβ3. A molecular model of talin F3 indicated that it resembles a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. PTB domains recognize peptide ligands containing β turns, often formed by NPXY motifs. NPX(Y/F) motifs are highly conserved in integrin β tails, and mutations that disrupt this motif interfere with both integrin activation and talin binding. Thus, integrin binding to talin resembles the interactions of PTB domains with peptide ligands. These resemblances suggest that the activation of integrins requires the presence of a β turn at NPX(Y/F) motifs conserved in integrin β cytoplasmic domains.

Normal functioning of the >20 human integrins often requires dynamic cellular regulation of integrin ligand binding affinity (integrin activation). Activation of integrins is important in many biological processes, including cell migration, hemostasis, extracellular matrix assembly, tumor metastasis, and the immune response (1Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 2Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H.

Integrin αβ heterodimers generally possess two short cytoplasmic domains (tails). The integrin β tail plays a central role in the activation process, probably by undergoing regulated interactions with certain cytoplasmic proteins (1Hughes P.E. Pfaff M.

Talin is an abundant and widely expressed 250-kDa integrin β tail-binding protein implicated in integrin activation (4Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Talin is composed of a 50-kDa head and 205-kDa rod domain. The head domain contains a major integrin-binding site (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

The capacity of this fragment to activate integrin αIIbβ3 is lost when the head domain is deleted from it or when the β3 cytoplasmic domain is truncated (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J.

Talin binding to integrin β tails can be regulated via calpain proteolysis (6Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or through the binding of phosphoinositides (8Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of either talin and/or integrin (9Beckerle M.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C.A. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar) could provide additional mechanisms for regulation of integrin-talin interactions. Thus, the talin head domain is implicated in integrin activation, and modulation of its binding to integrins is likely to contribute to the regulation of integrin activation. The talin head domain contains a predicted FERM domain (bandfour-point-one/ezrin/radixin/moesin homology domain) (11Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). FERM domains are found in a number of proteins and often mediate their interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins (12Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Edwards S.D. Keep N.H.

Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) reveal a very similar overall fold. The FERM domain consists of a trefoil arrangement of three subdomains, each showing similarity to known domains. The first subdomain, F1 (using the nomenclature of Pearson et al. (17Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar)), contains a five-stranded β sheet with an α helix running across it and is similar to ubiquitin. The F2 subdomain is entirely α helical with a short linker region and shows similarity to the acyl-CoA-binding protein. The F3 subdomain is a sandwich of two orthogonal antiparallel β sheets followed by an α helix; this fold is found in a number of structures, including the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB)1 and pleckstrin homology domains. In this study, we have localized a principal integrin β tail-binding site of talin to the predicted 96-residue PTB-like subdomain within the talin FERM domain and shown that expression of this PTB-like F3 subdomain leads to integrin activation. Furthermore, like other PTB domain ligands, the capacity of the β3tail to bind the talin PTB-like domain depends on the integrity of a β turn-forming NPXY motif. These similarities between integrin binding to talin and PTB domain-ligand interactions suggest that activation of integrins by the talin PTB-like F3 subdomain requires a stable β turn at NPX(Y/F) motifs conserved in many integrin β cytoplasmic domains.

The anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibodies PAC1 and anti-LIBS6 and the αIIbβ3-specific antagonist Ro43-5054 have been described previously (3O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol.

The 5′-primer was designed to allow introduction of an N-terminal hemagglutinin tag during expression in mammalian cells. A cDNA for the mouse Dok PTB domain (amino acids 149–256; entry TrEMBL (accession number P97465)) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pCMV-Tag3 (Stratagene) to allow expression of an N-terminally c-Myc-tagged protein. Recombinant model proteins of integrin cytoplasmic tails and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O.

Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy revealed that integrin tail model proteins varied by <0.1% from the predicted molecular mass for the non-phosphorylated proteins (19Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, GST was removed by addition of thrombin (∼1 unit/mg of protein) and mixing overnight at room temperature.p-Aminobenzamidine beads (Sigma) and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were then added to the mixture to remove the thrombin and GST. Proteins were dialyzed in running buffer (75 mm NaCl, 1.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 2.2 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4). Affinity chromatography was performed using recombinant integrin tails bound to His-Bind resin (Novagen) as previously described (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). 5 μl of coated beads and 1 μg of purified GST fusion protein were routinely used. Bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. SPR analysis was performed as previously described using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (6Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, sufficient streptavidin to generate an increase of ∼500 resonance units was coupled to activated CM5 sensor chips (6Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recombinant β3 tails were biotinylated on a unique cysteine residue and immobilized on sensor chips via a biotin-avidin linkage (6Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Tails were immobilized at a level previously determined to minimize mass transport artifacts. The binding of a range of concentrations of purified recombinant talin subdomains to the β3-coated chip was then analyzed. Analyte was injected using the KINJECT command specifying a 90 s association phase and a 40 s dissociation phase. Following completion of KINJECT, dissociation was followed for at least another 60 s. The use of KINJECT delays removal of the injection needle and so minimizes instrument noise at the start of the dissociation phase; however, a change in resonance units can be detected when the needle is removed following completion of the KINJECT dissociation phase 130 s after the start of the injection. The chip surfaces were regenerated with 2 m NaCl between experiments. All parameters were measured at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in running buffer. Sensorgrams were analyzed, and rate constants were calculated as previously described (6Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The kinetic data were interpreted in the context of a first-order kinetic model: A + B = AB (23Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 24Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). For such a model, the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants are described by Equation 1. dAB/dt=konA·B−koffAB(Eq. 1) Equation 1 can be expressed with the parameters used in SPR analysis as follows (Equation 2), dR/dt=konC·Rmax−(konC+koff)·R(Eq. 2) where R is the response in resonance units at timet, Rmax is the maximum response at saturating concentrations of analyte, and C is the concentration of the analyte solution. Hence, the gradient of the dR/dt versus R plot, −ks, is described by Equation 3. ks=konC+koff(Eq. 3) The dissociation rate constant value obtained from Equation 3may not be reliable for low ranges (26Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar); therefore, koff values were calculated from the dissociation phases of the sensorgrams using Equation 4, ln(R/R0)=−koff(t−t0)(Eq. 4) where R0 represents the response in resonance units at the start of dissociation, t0. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, was then determined from the ratio of these two kinetic constants (koff/kon).Kd was also calculated from Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding using Equation 5, Req/C=Rmax/Kd−Req/Kd(Eq. 5) where Req is the response in resonance units at equilibrium. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing integrin αIIbβ3 (3O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding Tac-α5 (1 μg) and talin fragments (3 μg) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 24 h later, three-color flow cytometry was performed as described previously (3O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 5Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended and stained with PAC1 and then washed and stained with biotinylated anti-Tac monoclonal antibody 7G7B6. Bound PAC1 and 7G7B6 were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (BioSource, International) and streptavidin-conjugated R-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Inc.), respectively. 5 min prior to analysis, propidium iodide (2 μg/ml final concentration) was added. Cells were washed and analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD PharMingen). PAC1 binding to live (propidium iodide-negative) transfected (7G7B6-positive) cells was assessed. αIIbβ3 activation was quantified as an activation index defined as (F −F0)/(Fmax −F0), where F is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding, F0 is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of the αIIbβ3 antagonist Ro43-5054 (1 μm), and Fmax is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of the αIIbβ3-activating monoclonal antibody anti-LIBS6 (2 μm). The percentage change in activation index (AI) following transfection was calculated as 100 × (AI − AI0)/(AI0), where AI0 = AI in cells transfected with the control vector. Three-dimensional homology models of the F3 subdomain of talin were made using the program Modeler 4 (27Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). Initial sequence alignments made with ClustalW (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) were manually edited to match the hydrophobic residues that constitute the core of the subdomain limiting the presence of insertions to the loops. The crystal structures of moesin, radixin, and band 4.1 (14Han B.G. Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Edwards S.D. Keep N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7061-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Hamada K. Shimizu T.

Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) were used as templates independently or combined. The quality of the models was assessed with the program WHAT IF (29Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 1: 99-104Google Scholar). A talin fragment that contains the head domain (talin-(1–1071)), but not one that lacks the head domain (talin-(434–1071)), can activate αIIbβ3 integrins (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). To determine whether a portion of the talin head domain was sufficient for these functions, we analyzed a fragment of the talin head containing Glu186–Gln435 that binds to the integrin β1D tail (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Talin-(186–435) bound to the β3 (but not αIIb) tail (Fig.1A), and binding was inhibited by a Tyr-to-Ala mutation in the first NPXY motif, β3(Y747A) (Fig. 1A). This integrin-binding fragment of the head domain was sufficient to activate αIIbβ3 integrins in CHO cells (Fig.1B). The magnitude of activation was comparable to that observed for the previously described talin-(1–1071) fragment (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) (mean increase in activation index = 76% (p = 0.001) versus 65% (p = 0.0003)). Furthermore, a fragment of talin that lacks this region (talin-(434–1071)) had no effect on the activation state of αIIbβ3 (mean change in activation index = 3%, p > 0.7) (Fig. 1B). The expression of talin-(186–435), talin-(1–1071), and talin-(434–1071) was confirmed in immunoblots of the transfected cells (data not shown). Thus, expression of a 250-amino acid β3 tail-binding fragment of the talin head domain is sufficient to induce αIIbβ3 activation. As described above, we have localized an integrin-binding and -activating fragment of the talin head to residues 186–435. This fragment contains part of a predicted FERM domain (11Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). FERM domains are found in a large number of proteins; however, the overall sequence identity is often low (12Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). BLAST analysis of the talin head domain revealed highly significant similarity to consensus FERM domain sequences (Conserved Domain Database sequences CD:pfam00373 and CD:smart-00295) generated using the Pfam and SMART programs (score 243, E = 2 × 10−65; and score 153, E = 2 × 10−38 , respectively). Individual BLAST comparison of the talin head domain with the sequences of crystallized moesin, radixin, and band 4.1 FERM domains demonstrated 25, 25, and 20% identities and 46, 47, and 37% similarities, respectively. These similarities establish significant (E = 4 × 10−10, 4 × 10−10, and 3 × 10−6, respectively) homology of this region of talin to these FERM domains. FERM domains are composed of three subdomains (F1, F2, and F3) (14Han B.G. Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Edwards S.D. Keep N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7061-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Hamada K. Shimizu T.

Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To identify the boundaries of the subdomains within the talin FERM domain, we aligned the talin head domain sequence with other FERM domains (Fig.2). Superposition of the moesin secondary and tertiary structural elements (17Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) allowed us to predict that the mouse talin F2 subdomain extends from Ser206 to Leu305 and the F3 subdomain from Gly309 to Ser405 (numbered according to Swiss Protein Database entry TALI_MOUSE (accession number P26039)). Superposition of the moesin structure on multiple alignments of FERM domains generated by ClustalW (16Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and hydrophobic cluster (12Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) analyses predicted very similar domain boundaries for the talin F2 and F3 subdomains. Therefore, three sequence alignments predicted identical boundaries for the talin F2 and F3 subdomains and indicated that talin-(186–435) contains all of the F2 and F3 subdomains, but only the last predicted β strand of the F1 subdomain. This suggested that the F2 and/or F3 subdomain might be responsible for β tail binding and integrin activation. As described above, a talin fragment containing both predicted F2 and F3 subdomains bound integrin β cytoplasmic domains. We therefore prepared individual F2 (talin-(206–305)) and F3 (talin-(309–405)) subdomains. Affinity chromatography revealed that both F2 and F3 subdomains bound the β3 tail (Fig.3A). As observed for larger talin fragments, both F2 and F3 exhibited greatly reduced binding to the β3(Y747A) tail and almost undetectable binding to the αIIb tail (Fig. 3A). Both talin F2 and F3 subdomains also bound to the β1A and β1D integrin cytoplasmic tails, and binding was reduced by Tyr-to-Ala mutations in the first NPXY motif of these tails (data not shown). The binding was not due to a nonspecific interaction with the β tail, as purified GST did not bind (data not shown). Furthermore, removal of the GST moiety by thrombin digestion did not impair the ability of either the F2 or F3 subdomain to bind to β3tails (see below). Thus, both predicted F2 and F3 subdomains of the talin FERM domain bound specifically to the β3 tail. We examined the real-time binding of each of these subdomains to the β3 tail by SPR. SPR analysis was performed using biotinylated β3 tail model proteins immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (coupling level of 500 resonance units), and the data were analyzed in the context of a first-order kinetic model (A + B = AB) (6Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These analyses revealed typical association and dissociation phases for both talin F2 and F3 subdomains (Fig. 3B). Under similar conditions, no binding of talin-(1–280) or talin-(1–186) was detected, consistent with their lack of interaction in affinity chromatography experiments (5Calderwood D.A. Zent R.

Furthermore, as previously observed for the talin head domain (6Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Data were analyzed using Equations (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5), defined under “Experimental Procedures.” The association rate constantkon was obtained from Equation 3 (Fig.4B) using the association phase of the curve, and the dissociation rate constantkoff was obtained from the dissociation phases of the sensorgrams using Equation 4 (23Schuck P.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Using this method, rather than BIAevaluation software, the r2 values reported in Fig. 4 provide a measure of the goodness of fit (25O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). As recommended by the manufacturer (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden), data collected 10 s after injection start or stop were excluded from the analysis to avoid sample dispersion effects. At the ligand coupling level used, koff values (calculated from Equation 4) were independent of the concentration of analyte (talin F2 or F3 subdomain) used (Fig. 4A). This indicates negligible rebinding of analyte during the dissociation phase. Plots ofksversus analyte concentration (Fig.4B) were also linear. This is consistent with a simple first-order interaction and facilitates calculation ofkon from Equation 3. These analyses allowed us to calculate that talin F3 bound the β3 tail with a 4-fold higher affinity than talin F2 (Kd = 130 ± 10 and 540 ± 40 nm, respectively), primarily due to a markedly reduced on-rate for talin F2 ((3.9 ± 0.2) × 103m−1 s−1) relative to F3 ((3.3 ± 0.1) × 104m−1 s−1) (Table I).

The mechanism involves a massive light-dependent translocation of the photoreceptor-specific G protein, transducin, between the functional compartments of rods. To characterize the mechanism, we developed a novel technique that combines serial tangential cryodissection of the rat retina with Western blot analysis of protein distribution in the sections. Up to 90% of transducin translocates from rod outer segments to other cellular compartments on the time scale of tens of minutes. The reduction in the transducin content of the rod outer segments is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the amplification of the rod photoresponse, allowing rods to operate in illumination up to 10-fold higher than would otherwise be possible."

We show that Dliprin-α and Dlar are required for normal synaptic morphology. We also find that synapse complexity is proportional to the amount of Dlar gene product, suggesting that Dlar activity determines synapse size. Ultrastructural analysis reveals that Dliprin-α and Dlar are required to define the size and shape of the presynaptic active zone. Accordingly, there is a concomitant decrease in synaptic transmission in both mutants. Finally, epistasis analysis indicates that Dliprin-α is required for Dlar's action at the synapse. These data suggest a model where Dliprin-α and Dlar cooperate to regulate the formation and/or maintenance of a network of presynaptic proteins."

We show that GRIP binds to the liprin-α/SYD2 family of proteins that interact with LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) and that are implicated in presynaptic development. In neurons, liprin-α and LAR-RPTP are enriched at synapses and coimmunoprecipitate with GRIP and AMPA receptors. Dominant-negative constructs that interfere with the GRIP-liprin interaction disrupt the surface expression and dendritic clustering of AMPA receptors in cultured neurons. Thus, by mediating the targeting of liprin/GRIP-associated proteins, liprin-α is important for postsynaptic as well as presynaptic maturation."

The best known examples are high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides, and colossal magnetoresistance in manganese oxides ('manganites'). All of these materials undergo a range of order-disorder transitions associated with changes in charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom. Measurements of such order are usually made by diffraction techniques, which detect the ionic cores and the spins of the conduction electrons. Unfortunately, because such techniques are only weakly sensitive to valence electrons and yield superpositions of signals from distinct submicrometre-scale phases, they cannot directly image phase coexistence and charge ordering, two key features of the manganites. Here we present scanning tunnelling microscope measurements of the manganite Bi1-xCaxMnO3. We show that charge ordering and phase separation can be resolved in real space with atomic-scale resolution. By taking together images and current-voltage spectroscopy data we find that charge order correlates with both structural order and the local conductive state (either metallic or insulating). These experiments provide an atomic-scale basis for descriptions of manganites as mixtures of electronically and structurally distinct phases."
https://openalex.org/W2126721293,"Imprinted genes are expressed differently depending on whether they are carried by a chromosome of maternal or paternal origin. Correct imprinting is established by germline-specific modifications; failure of this process underlies several inherited human syndromes. All these imprinting control defects are cis-acting, disrupting establishment or maintenance of allele-specific epigenetic modifications across one contiguous segment of the genome. In contrast, we report here an inherited global imprinting defect. This recessive maternal-effect mutation disrupts the specification of imprints at multiple, non-contiguous loci, with the result that genes normally carrying a maternal methylation imprint assume a paternal epigenetic pattern on the maternal allele. The resulting conception is phenotypically indistinguishable from an androgenetic complete hydatidiform mole, in which abnormal extra-embryonic tissue proliferates while development of the embryo is absent or nearly so. This disorder offers a genetic route to the identification of trans-acting oocyte factors that mediate maternal imprint establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2002478276,"Kainate receptors (KARs) on CA1 pyramidal cells make no detectable contribution to EPSCs. We report that these receptors have a metabotropic function, as shown previously for CA1 interneurons. Brief kainate exposure caused long-lasting inhibition of a postspike potassium current (I(sAHP)) in CA1 pyramidal cells. The pharmacological profile was independent of AMPA receptors or the GluR5 subunit, indicating a possible role for the GluR6 subunit. KAR inhibition of I(sAHP) did not require ionotropic action or network activity, but was blocked by the inhibitor of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), or the PKC inhibitor calphostin C. These data suggest how KARs, putatively containing GluR6, directly increase excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells and help explain the propensity for seizure activity following KAR activation."

Here we show that striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is a component of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complex. Functionally, exogenous STEP depressed NMDAR single-channel activity in excised membrane patches. STEP also depressed NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents whereas inhibiting endogenous STEP enhanced these currents. In hippocampal slices, administering STEP into CA1 neurons did not affect basal glutamatergic transmission evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation but prevented tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP). Conversely, inhibiting STEP in CA1 neurons enhanced transmission and occluded LTP induction through an NMDAR-, Src-, and Ca2+-dependent mechanism. Thus, STEP acts as a tonic brake on synaptic transmission by opposing Src-dependent upregulation of NMDARs."

Activity in the superior parietal lobe (SPL) increased proportionally to viewpoint disparity during mental rotation, but not during object recognition. In contrast, the fusiform gyrus was preferentially recruited in a viewpoint-dependent manner in recognition as compared to mental rotation. In addition, independent of the effect of viewpoint, object recognition was associated with ventral areas and mental rotation with dorsal areas. These results indicate that the similar behavioral effects of viewpoint obtained in these two tasks are based on different neural substrates. Such findings call into question the hypothesis that mental rotation is used to compensate for changes in viewpoint during object recognition."

NSF and PICK1 bind the AMPAR GluR2 subunit and are involved in trafficking of AMPARs. Here, we show that GluR2, PICK1, NSF, and α-/β-SNAPs form a complex in the presence of ATPγS. Similar to SNARE complex disassembly, NSF ATPase activity disrupts PICK1-GluR2 interactions in this complex. α- and β-SNAP have differential effects on this reaction. SNAP overexpression in hippocampal neurons leads to corresponding changes in AMPAR trafficking by acting on GluR2-PICK1 complexes. This demonstrates that the previously reported synaptic stabilization of AMPARs by NSF involves disruption of GluR2-PICK1 interactions. Furthermore, we are reporting a non-SNARE substrate for NSF disassembly activity."

These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro; Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA), supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (for HepG2 and NIH3T3) or 20% (for Caco-2) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The human colon cancer-derived cell line T-84 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) with the antibiotics described above and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. A degenerate primer approach with primers 5′-TGG ATG GA(A/G) TGT GC(A/T/G/C) AC(A/T/G/C) CA(C/T)-3′ and 5′-GA GCA (G/A)GA (A/G)AA GCA (A/T/G/C)AG (A/G/T/C)AT(G/T/A)AT (A/G/T/C)CC-3′, corresponding to the mouse claudin-2 sequence, was used to amplify 407 bp of the open reading frame of human claudin-2. Data base searches with the putative human claudin-2 sequence identified several human claudin-2 expressed sequence tag clones, which were used to complement the 5′ and 3′ sequence. Additional PCR with the primers 5′-GCT TCT ACT GAG AGG TCT G-3′ and 5′-TTC TTC ACA CAT ACC CTG-3′, and DNA sequencing was utilized to confirm the expression of the full-length human claudin-2 sequence in T-84 cells. DNA and amino acid sequence of human claudin-2 has been submitted to GenBankTM and is available under the accession numberAF250558. The GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to isolate the 5′-flanking region of the human claudin-2 gene. In brief, the first PCR was performed with gene-specific primer 1 (5′-CAA AAG CCC CAG AAG GCC TAG GAT GTA G-3′; +30 to +57 relative to the adenosine of the methionine start codon of the human claudin-2 cDNA; GenBankTM accession numbersAF250558 or AF177340) and adaptor primer 1. The second PCR was done with gene-specific primer 2 (5′-GGC AGA CCT CTC AGT AGA AGC GTC TTC-3′; −27 to −1; corresponding to the 493–519 sequence of AF177340) and adaptor primer 2. The longest PCR fragment was purified and subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was designated as pCR-hCL2p and sequenced. The KpnI/XhoI fragment of pCR-hCL2p was subcloned into the KpnI/XhoI site of the pGL3B vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Various length fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the human claudin-2 gene were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGL3B. To obtain the −62 construct, theHindIII/XbaI fragment from the −84 construct was ligated to the EcoRI/HindIII-digested −84 construct with complementary 38-base oligonucleotides (designated as −62wt, from −62 to −31; sense, 5′-AAT TCA TAT TTA ATC TGG TTT ATG GAT TTT TTT TAG GT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTA GAC CTA AAA AAA ATC CAT AAA CCA GAT TAA ATA TG) with 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XbaI overhangs (underlined). To make mutant claudin-2 promoter constructs, mutated 38-base oligonucleotides were substituted for the wild type sequence. For Mut1, Mut2, and Mut1 + 2, 5′-AAT TCA TAT TTA ATC TGG TGG CTG GAT TTT TTT TAG GT-3′, 5′-AAT TCA TAT TTA ATC TGG TTT ATG GAT TTT TTG GCG GT-3′, and 5′-AAT TCA TAT TTA ATC TGG TGG CTG GAT TTT TTG GCG GT-3′ were used, respectively. (Only sense strands are shown; nucleotide substitutions are indicated with bold type.) For reporter assays, a DNA transfection mixture was prepared consisting of 1 μg of the reporter construct and 20 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega) as an internal control. The cells were split onto 6-well plates 18 h before transfection. The cell confluency at transfection was 40–60%. The individual DNA mixtures were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For cotransfection experiments, 0.5 μg of the expression vector was transfected along with reporter vectors. pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) was used to equalize the amount of transfected DNA. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a luminometer. Transfection efficiencies were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity of the pRL-CMV vector, and the results are expressed as the mean relative luciferase activity ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Nuclear proteins were prepared as previously described (33Awane M. Andres P.G., Li, D.J. Reinecker H.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5337-5344PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic fractions obtained during this procedure were separated for Western blot analysis. The double-stranded oligonucleotides, −62wt, Mut1, Mut2, and Mut1 + 2, were used as probes or cold competitors to analyze the interaction between Cdx protein and DNA. The HNF-1 wild type probe from −67 to −51 of the human claudin-2 gene sequence consisted of complementary 29-nucleotide oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-AAT TCC TGG TCA ATA TTT AAT CTG T-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTA GAC AGA TTA AAT ATT GAC CAG G-3′) with 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XbaI overhangs (underlined). Mutant HNF complementary oligonucleotides were as follows: sense, 5′-AAT TCC TAA TTC AGG TTT AAT CTG T-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTA GAC AGA TTA AAC CTG AAT TAG G-3′ (nucleotide substitutions are indicated with bold type). The probes were labeled with Klenow enzyme by fill-in incorporation with nucleotide triphosphates, including [α-32P]dATP. The binding reaction was performed as previously described (34Traber P.G., Wu, G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For a competition assay, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction. To perform supershift assay, the binding mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μl of antibodies. The samples were fractionated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. The resultant DNA-protein complexes were detected by autoradiography. The protein concentration of each sample was quantified by the Bradford method. The samples were electrophoresed through a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 10% dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), followed by the incubation for 3 h at room temperature with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 1:1000. After washing in PBS-T for 30 min, the blots were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature. The hybridized bands were detected by an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated from tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (30 μg) was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Magna NT, MicroSeparations Inc., Westbrough, MA) by capillary blotting. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Rediprime random primer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized with radiolabeled probes in Quickhyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 65 °C for 1 h. The membranes were washed with 0.1% SDS, 2× sodium chloride sodium citrate buffer at room temperature for 15 min and at 65 °C for 10 min. The blots were analyzed by autoradiography. The probes used to detect claudin-1, claudin-2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were described previously (3Kinugasa T. Sakaguchi T., Gu, X. Reinecker H.C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1001-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Other probes were: Cdx1, a 0.9-kbHindIII/XbaI fragment of pRc/CMV-Cdx1; Cdx2, a 0.9-kb HindIII fragment of pRc/CMV-Cdx2; and HNF-1α, a 0.4-kb SmaI fragment of pBJ5mHNF1α. The HNF-1α probe derives from a unique sequence in HNF-1α cDNA and does not cross-hybridize with HNF-1β. Northern blots were densitometrically analyzed, and gene-specific mRNA expression levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression levels in the same samples and expressed as the mean density/area calculated from three independent experiments. Mice carrying the HNF-1α null allele were obtained from Dr. Frank J. Gonzalez (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (35Lee Y.H. Sauer B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3059-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Homozygous HNF-1α null and wild type littermates were obtained by mating heterozygous carriers. All of the animal experiments were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and protocols approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at our institute. The liver and kidney were removed and washed with ice-cold PBS. Segments of 2 cm from the most proximal jejunum and the most distal ileum were collected. For immunostaining, small tissue blocks were mounted in OCT compound and frozen in dry ice-ethanol. For RNA extraction, small pieces of tissues were snap frozen at −80 °C. 4-μm-thick cryosections of frozen tissues were prepared. The sections were air-dried and fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min followed by rehydration in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min as previously described (2Rahner C. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The sections were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h at 20 °C and incubated with primary antibodies or normal rabbit serum diluted at 1:100 with blocking solution for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the slides were incubated at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted at 1:500 with blocking solution for 1 h in the dark and analyzed with an AX-70 Olympus fluorescent microscope. The 5′-flanking region of the claudin-2 gene isolated from the human genomic library and T-84 cell-derived claudin-2 cDNA sequence were confirmed by sequence comparison with the human genomic clone AL158821. A BLAST search revealed that the gene encoding human claudin-2 is located on chromosome X, mapping to q22.3–23. The claudin-2 mRNA expressed in T-84 cells contains an open reading frame of 693 bp. Human and mouse claudin-2 have a high sequence identity of 87% on the mRNA level and 93% identity on the amino acid level. Comparison with the mouse claudin-2 promoter in genomic data bases revealed that the promoters of the human and mouse claudin-2 genes possess a remarkable homology of 84% for the region of −1 to −400 (Fig. 1). The mouse claudin-2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AK004990) recovered by cap trapping revealed the putative transcriptional start site at 152 bp upstream of the translational start codon. The transcriptional initiation site is located within a consensus initiator element (Inr; NCANNNNN) (36Suzuki Y. Tsunoda T. Sese J. Taira H. Mizushima-Sugano J. Hata H. Ota T. Isogai T. Tanaka T. Nakamura Y. Suyama A. Sakaki Y. Morishita S. Okubo K. Sugano S. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The promoters of the human and mouse claudin-2 genes have no TATA box near the putative transcriptional initiation site (Fig. 1). However, a CAAT box is located at −60 to −63 bp, and two E boxes (CANNTG) are located at −198 to −195 bp and −67 to −62 bp (Fig. 1), suggesting that regulatory elements to initiate gene transcription are present. The human claudin-2 promoter contains two sites for the intestine-specific homeodomain protein family Cdx (18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), designated CdxA and CdxB (Fig. 1). The promoter has also binding sites for HNF-1 and HNF-3β (38Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), as well as putative AP-1- (39Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2247-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), NF-κB- (40Gilmore T.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 841-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and GATA-binding (41Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) sites. Particularly, the first Cdx-binding site CdxA and the HNF-1-, HNF-3β-, and GATA-binding sites are conserved in human and mouse claudin-2 promoters (Fig. 1). To identify the regions involved in regulating claudin-2 gene transcription, sequentially deleted 5′-flanking regions (−1041, −393, −84, −62, and −31 to +148) were cloned into the reporter plasmid pGL3B. Reporter constructs were transfected into intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, hepatic cell line HepG2, or fibroblast cell line NIH3T3. In Caco-2 cells the claudin-2 promoter fragments containing −1040 to −62 bp of the 5′-flanking region induced a 18–29-fold increase in relative luciferase activity above that observed after transfection with the control null reporter construct (Fig.2). In contrast, the same promoter regions achieved only a 7–11-fold increase when transfected into HepG2 and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2). Removal of the putative AP-1 site and the NF-κB site decreased the promoter activity slightly. Disruption of the HNF-1-binding site in the −62-bp construct did not alter the promoter activity significantly in Caco-2 cells. However, removal of the Cdx-binding sites resulted in a loss of promoter activity in Caco-2, HepG2, and NIH3T3 cells (Fig.2). To examine the function of the two Cdx sites, mutations were introduced into CdxA (Mut1), CdxB (Mut2), or both (Mut1 + 2) (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, mutation in the CdxA (Mut1) or CdxB (Mut2) site decreased the promoter activity to 30 and 61% of that observed with −62 wild type construct, respectively. When both sites were mutated (Mut1 + 2), promoter activity was decreased to 15% of the wild type construct, comparable with the −31 construct lacking both Cdx sites. Next we determined the ability of Cdx1 and Cdx2 to activate the claudin-2 promoter. As shown in Fig.4A, Cdx2 but not Cdx1 protein was detectable in nuclear proteins from Caco-2 cells. Transient expression with either Cdx1 or Cdx2 alone or in combination resulted in the strong expression of these proteins in the nuclei of Caco-2 cells 48 h after transfection (Fig. 4A). Ectopic expression of Cdx1 did not alter the expression level of Cdx2, nor did Cdx2 overexpression induce Cdx1 protein expression in the nuclei (Fig.4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, Cdx1 overexpression resulted in a 3.5-fold increase of the promoter activity driven by the −62 construct containing both intact Cdx sites in Caco-2 cells (92-fold relative to the activity of null pGL3B vector). In contrast, Cdx2 overexpression increased the activity of the same construct up to 6.7-fold (177-fold of null pGL3B vector activity). Overexpression of Cdx1 and Cdx2 together did not significantly increase the activity above the values achieved by Cdx2 alone (Fig.4B). Although mutation of either the CdxA (Mut1) or CdxB (Mut2) site retained the ability to respond to Cdx2 overexpression, promoter activities induced by Cdx2 overexpression were less than 25 and 43% of that observed in −62 construct, respectively. Similarly, Mut1 and Mut2 constructs were less sensitive to Cdx1 overexpression. In the absence of both Cdx sites neither Cdx1 nor Cdx2 overexpression induced a significant induction of reporter gene transcription in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4B). The ability of Cdx2 to induce a stronger induction of claudin-2 promoter activity in comparison with Cdx1 was specific for Caco-2 cells. As demonstrated in Fig.4C, Cdx1 and Cdx2 enhanced claudin-2 promoter activity in fibroblasts 2.7- and 2.8-fold, respectively, whereas Cdx1 induced a 2.9-fold and Cdx2 induced a 6.7-fold higher promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. To further define the interaction between Cdx2 and the two Cdx sites, EMSA and supershifts were performed with nuclear proteins from Caco-2 cells. These experiments were carried out in post-confluent Caco-2 cells because it was shown that specific Cdx-DNA complexes can be obscured by unspecific binding of unknown peptides in nuclear proteins from preconfluent Caco-2 cells (22Fang R. Santiago N.A. Olds L.C. Sibley E. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, three DNA-protein complexes (A, B, and C) were observed when binding reactions were carried out with radiolabeled wild type oligonucleotide containing both intact Cdx sites (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Unlabeled Mut2 oligonucleotide with an intact CdxA but a mutated CdxB competed with the formation of all three complexes, whereas unlabeled Mut1 oligonucleotide with a mutated CdxA but an intact CdxB prevented only the formation of complex B (Fig.5A, lanes 3 and 4). In supershift assays, anti-Cdx2 antibody shifted only complex A to reveal two distinct Cdx2-containing protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 5A, lane 7). In contrast, anti-Cdx1 antibody did not affect the mobility of the complexes (Fig. 5A, lane 6). The Cdx2-containing complex A was also formed with radiolabeled Mut2 oligonucleotide used as a probe (Fig. 5A, lane 10), suggesting that this complex is preferentially formed with CdxA. Complex B did not form on the Cdx sites because this complex was detected and consequently competed by all three mutated oligonucleotides (Fig. 5A, lanes 3–5, 9, 11, and 13). Mutation in the CdxA site greatly reduced the formation of complex C, suggesting the that formation of complex C is dependent on this site (Fig. 5A, lanes 8 and 12). Within the SI gene promoter two adjacent Cdx consensus sites may be able to direct the formation of Cdx2 homodimers (18Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We therefore further characterized t"
https://openalex.org/W2076583332,"A unique feature of the olfactory bulb circuit is the long projection of the mitral cell lateral dendrites. Through dendrodendritic reciprocal synapses, these dendrites connect one olfactory glomerular module to hundreds of others; but the functional principles governing these extensive lateral interactions remain largely unknown. Here we report that the spatial extent of action potential propagation in these dendrites is dynamically regulated by inhibitory synapses distributed along the dendrites. The extent of propagation determines the spatial pattern of Ca2+ influx and thus the range and number of dendrodendritic synapses to be activated. Accordingly, network control of spike traffic in the mitral cell lateral dendrites can mediate dynamic interaction with different combinations of glomerular modules in response to different odorants."
https://openalex.org/W2126167700,"Recently it has been shown that the potent apoptotic agent ceramide activates a mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and promotes dephosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2 (Ruvolo, P. P., Deng, X., Ito, T., Carr, B. K., and May, W. S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 20296–20300). In cells expressing Bcl2, dephosphorylation of Bcl2 appears to be required for ceramide-induced cell death because treatment of cells with low doses of the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid blocks Bcl2 dephosphorylation and promotes cell survival. Furthermore, the non-phosphorylatable (i.e. PP2A-resistant) gain-of-function S70E mutant Bcl2 can protect cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis. These findings support a model whereby Bcl2 function is regulated by PP2A. PP2A is a heterotrimer that contains a catalytic C-subunit, a structural A-subunit, and a regulatory B-subunit. The A- and C-subunits are fairly conserved and ubiquitously expressed, and they form the catalytic complex of the phosphatase. In contrast, there are at least three families of diverse B-subunit molecules that vary in expression temporally and by tissue type. It is hypothesized that ceramide regulates PP2A via the B-subunit. Thus, understanding the mechanism of how PP2A regulates Bcl2 phosphorylation status and how ceramide might regulate this process requires identification of the regulatory B-subunit of PP2A that comprises the Bcl2 phosphatase. Results indicate that the B56 α-subunit is a candidate regulatory subunit of the physiologic Bcl2 phosphatase since (a) B56 α associates with Bcl2 as evidenced by pull-down experiments, (b) B56 α co-localizes with Bcl2 in mitochondrial membranes, (c) ceramide promotes translocation of B56 α to mitochondrial membranes, and (d) overexpression of B56 α promotes mitochondrial PP2A activity and Bcl2 dephosphorylation and potentiates cell killing with ceramide. These findings suggest a role for B56 α in regulating the Bcl2 phosphatase. Recently it has been shown that the potent apoptotic agent ceramide activates a mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and promotes dephosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2 (Ruvolo, P.

The non-phosphorylatable (i.e. PP2A-resistant) gain-of-function S70E mutant Bcl2 can protect cells from ceramide-induced apoptosis at concentrations of ceramide (i.e. >10 μm) where wild-type Bcl2 is not phosphorylated and fails to protect cells from ceramide-induced killing (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This finding strongly suggests that dephosphorylation of Bcl2 is required for ceramide-induced cell death in cells expressing Bcl2. Because ceramide production is a nearly universal component of apoptosis (13Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Smyth M.L. Obeid L.M.

Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Identification of the PP2A isoform(s) that is the physiologic Bcl2 phosphatase will be critical for determining the mechanism by which PP2A regulates Bcl2 function. PP2A is a major protein serine/threonine phosphatase that participates in many signaling pathways in mammalian cells (18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). It is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (the 36-kDa C-subunit PP2A/C), a structural subunit (the 65-kDa A-subunit PP2A/A), and a regulatory subunit (the B-subunit PP2A/B, which can vary in size from 50 to 130 kDa). The catalytic and structural subunits are evolutionary conserved (18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 19Orgad S. Brewis N.D. Alphey L.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). There are two highly homologous isoforms each of the C-subunit (98% amino acid homology between α and β isoforms) (18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 19Orgad S. Brewis N.D. Alphey L. Dudai Y. Cohen P.T.

Hemmings B.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7215-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the A-subunit (87% amino acid homology between α and β isoforms) (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 15Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). The A- and C-subunits are ubiquitously expressed (22Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Baumgartner S. Bilbe G. Ohkura H. Glover D.M. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and they form a catalytic complex (PP2A/AC) that interacts with at least three families of regulatory subunits (B, B56, and PR72/130) and tumor antigens (e.g.SV40 small T antigen) (18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The regulatory B-subunits of PP2A are expressed differentially by tissue and temporally during development (18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 23Mayer R.E. Hendrix P. Cron P. Matthies R. Stone S.R. Goris J. Merlevede W. Hofsteenge J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2578-2588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, PP2A substrate specificity appears to be determined by the B-subunit (27Cegielska A. Shaffer S. Derua R. Goris J. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4616-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Finally, there is evidence that the regulatory B-subunits may target the PP2A catalytic complex to intracellular sites such as microtubules (28Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) or the nucleus (29McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). These features of the PP2A regulatory B-subunits suggest that it is the B-subunit that defines PP2A isoforms and their physiologic roles. Thus, identification of the B-subunit(s) that makes up the physiologic Bcl2 phosphatase will elucidate the mechanism by which PP2A regulates Bcl2 function. All reagents used were purchased from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. REH and HL60 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 + 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The B56 α cDNA-containing pCMV plasmid was introduced into HL60 cells by electroporation (200-V, 975-microfarad capacitance) and selected and maintained in the above medium plus 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were treated with increasing doses of C2-ceramide (Calbiochem) or etoposide (Sigma) for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion, and apoptosis was analyzed using a DNA laddering method as described previously (30Ruvolo P.P. Gao F. Blalock W.L. Deng X. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11754-11765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and the phosphorylation status of Bcl2 was determined by immunoprecipitation as described previously (1Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed in a 12% acrylamide, 0.1% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −80 °C. The same blot was used for Western blotting using an anti-Bcl2 antiserum (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (1Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of cells was performed as described previously (1Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, cells were treated with 25 μm C2-ceramide for 3 h prior to fractionation. Cells were swelled in ice-cold hypotonic Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min, aspirated repeatedly through a 25-gauge needle (25 strokes), and centrifuged at 200 × g to pellet nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet the heavy membrane fraction containing mitochondria. Western blotting was performed as described previously (1Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) using antibodies to Bcl2 (DAKO), prohibitin (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ), and the following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): anti-B56 α, -PP2A/A, -PP2A/C, and -actin. Protein phosphatase activity of mitochondrial membrane fractions was determined as described previously (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Generation of free PO4 from the phosphopeptide RRA(pT)VA (where pT is a phosphorylated threonine) was measured using the molybdate-malachite green-phosphate complex assay as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Mitochondrial membranes were prepared as described above. The phosphatase assay was performed in a PP2A-specific reaction buffer (final concentration: 50 mmimidazole (pH 7.2), 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.02% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) using 100 μmphosphopeptide substrate and 2 μg of protein isolated from the mitochondrial membrane fraction. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature molybdate dye was added, and free phosphate was measured by optical density at 590 nm. A standard curve with free phosphate was used to determine the amount of free phosphate generated. Phosphatase activity was defined as pmole of free PO4 generated/μg of protein/min. Cells were treated with methanol to permeabilize and fix the cells. Fixed cells were adhered to a microscope slide using polyethyleneimine. The cells were washed and blocked with sera from the host animal of the secondary antibody to be used, and then primary antibody was added. Finally, an Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody was added, and cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope and photographed with a Hammamatsu digital camera in black and white. False color, deconvolution, and enhancement were accomplished with Openlab 3.0.4 and Photoshop 6.0. The B56 α antibody and PP2A/A antibody are both goat polyclonal sera from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Bcl2 antibody used is the mouse monoclonal antibody from DAKO. Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-goat serum and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-mouse serum (both from Molecular Probes) were used. Alexa Fluor 488 appears green, and Alexa Fluor 594 appears red when observed using a fluorescent microscope. To determine subcellular regions of protein co-localization, individual red- and green-stained images derived from the same field were merged using Photoshop 6.0. Areas of protein co-localization appear yellow. B56 α is up-regulated by ceramide in HL60 cells, although other B regulatory subunit genes are not. 2P. P. Ruvolo, W. Clark, T. Flagg, C. Mitchell, R. Ferguson, and W. S. May, unpublished data. If B56 α is part of the Bcl2 phosphatase, up-regulation of this PP2A-subunit may explain one way in which ceramide might induce dephosphorylation of Bcl2 in HL60 cells (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In a model where B56 α is the active B-subunit of the physiologic Bcl2 phosphatase, one would predict that B56 α would associate with Bcl2. Other subunits of the PP2A heterotrimer have been shown to associate with Bcl2 (11Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both the structural A-subunit and catalytic C-subunits of PP2A are co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl2 in pull-down experiments (11Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To determine whether B56 α co-immunoprecipitates with Bcl2, pull-down experiments using the Bcl2 antibody were performed. REH cells were used because these cells appear to have high levels of the Bcl2 phosphatase. Despite expressing high levels of Bcl2 protein, little if any Bcl2 is phosphorylated in REH cells (1Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid, however, induces phosphorylation of Bcl2 in REH cells, suggesting that PP2A is at least in part responsible for the hypophosphorylated status of Bcl2 in these cells. 3P. P. Ruvolo, W. Clark, and W. S. May, unpublished data. As shown in Fig.1, B56 α but not B α/β co-immunoprecipitates with Bcl2 using Bcl2 antisera. Both B-subunit proteins are present in the total lysate of REH cells (Fig. 1). Thus, B56 α is a candidate B-subunit comprising the physiologic Bcl2 phosphatase. A possible mechanism for how ceramide might activate the Bcl2 phosphatase is by promoting the translocation of PP2A to the mitochondrial membranes where the protein phosphatase would be expected to dephosphorylate Bcl2. Because the regulatory B-subunit has been implicated in modulating PP2A subcellular localization (28Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 29McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), it is possible that B56 α might recruit PP2A to subcellular locations where Bcl2 is functional. Although Bcl2 sometimes is found in nuclear membranes and in the endoplasmic reticulum (31Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3530) Google Scholar, 32Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is strong evidence that suppression of apoptosis by Bcl2 requires mitochondrial localization (33Petit P.X. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Minotte B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Only Bcl2 that is targeted to mitochondrial membranes can efficiently suppress apoptosis following serum deprivation in both Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and Rat-1/Myc cells (34Zhu W. Cowie A. Wasfy G.W. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4130-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the majority of Bcl2 found in REH and HL60 cells is located in the mitochondrial membranes (1Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). If ceramide activates the Bcl2 phosphatase via mitochondrial PP2A translocation, we would expect B56 α to translocate to the mitochondrial membranes in response to ceramide. Immunofluorescence was used to examine the effect of ceramide on B56 α co-localization with Bcl2 in REH cells (Fig.2). REH cells express basal levels of B56 α, whereas HL60 cells only express B56 α after ceramide treatment.3 REH cells were treated with 25 μmdihydroceramide or 10 μm C2-ceramide for 1 h. Subcellular distribution of B56 α and Bcl2 was then examined by immunofluorescence and compared with untreated cells (Fig.2). A mouse monoclonal antibody against human Bcl2 (DAKO) and a goat polyclonal B56 α antibody (Santa Cruz) was used so that cells could be simultaneously stained, and co-localization was examined using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-goat serum and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-mouse serum (both from Molecular Probes). Alexa Fluor 488 appears green, and Alexa Fluor 594 appears red when observed using a fluorescent microscope. As shown in Fig. 2, the majority of Bcl2 is non-cytosolic because it is distributed in small organelles (presumably mitochondria) as exhibited by the sharp punctate staining pattern, and ceramide has no effect on the subcellular distribution of Bcl2. The inactive ceramide analog, dihydroceramide, had no effect on subcellular localization of either B56 α or Bcl2 (Fig. 2). As seen in Fig. 2, B56 α is still localized primarily in the cytosol in the presence of dihydroceramide. Although the majority of B56 α is cytosolic in untreated cells, ceramide promotes co-localization of B56 α with Bcl2. B56 α in untreated cells displays a diffuse staining pattern, however, after ceramide treatment, and the staining pattern of B56 α suggests a movement from the cytosol to organelles as the staining pattern becomes less diffuse and more punctate (Fig. 2). Furthermore, ceramide appears to promote a fair degree of co-localization with Bcl2 as evidenced by merging optical fields stained with both Bcl2 (red) and B56 α (green) antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2, ceramide-treated cells display significant regions of the cell that are stained yellow. The yellow staining pattern represents areas where Bcl2 and B56 α are co-localized. In contrast, merged images of untreated cells or cells treated with dihydroceramide display significantly less yellow staining (Fig. 2). To determine the effect of ceramide on translocation of the PP2A catalytic complex (A- and C-subunits), we examined the effect of ceramide on subcellular distribution of the structural A-subunit (PP2A/A) in REH cells. Similar to B56 α, the majority of PP2A/A was cytosolic in untreated cells; however, after ceramide treatment the cells showed a more punctate pattern of PP2A/A staining (Fig.3). As observed in Fig. 3, there was significantly more co-localization of Bcl2 and PP2A/A in ceramide-treated cells (as evidenced by the significant increase in the yellow staining pattern) compared with untreated cells. This finding suggests that ceramide promotes translocation of the PP2A catalytic complex, possibly through B56 α in the case of the Bcl2 phosphatase. To confirm the results obtained by immunofluorescence, subcellular fractions were isolated as described previously (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The subcellular fractions include heavy membrane, light membrane, cytosol, and nuclear membrane fractions. The heavy membrane fraction contains mitochondrial membranes and is the predominant subcellular locale for Bcl2 in REH and HL60 cells (1Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Prohibitin, a mitochondrial protein, was used as a control (Fig. 4). A nuclear contaminant of prohibitin was observed and likely represented protein from undisrupted cells that were spun down with nuclei. No prohibitin was found in light membrane or cytosolic fractions, which suggests that these fractions are fairly free of mitochondrial membrane proteins. Prior to ceramide treatment, B56 α was found in the heavy membrane and light membrane fractions as well as in the cytosol (Fig. 4). It is not surprising that there was some basal level of B56 α existing in the heavy membrane fraction that contained mitochondrial membranes because REH cells exhibited little if any basal level of phosphorylated Bcl2 (1Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, after ceramide treatment cells showed significantly more B56 α in the heavy membrane fraction compared with untreated cells. These data suggest that ceramide promotes translocation of B56 α from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane fraction and support the findings by immunofluorescence that ceramide promotes greater co-localization of B56 α with Bcl2 (Fig. 2). Because protein was loaded in SDS-PAGE by amount (40 μg/fraction) rather than by cell equivalents, the protein detected by Western blotting in each fraction represents a different percentage of protein isolated. The amount of protein loaded in the heavy membrane fraction represents ∼20% of total protein recovered, whereas the protein detected in the cytosolic fraction is <1% of cytosolic protein recovered. Meanwhile, the amount of protein loaded in the light membrane fraction represents ∼40% of total protein recovered, whereas the protein detected in the nuclear fraction is ∼25% of nuclear protein recovered. Thus, although the density of the detected B56 α bands in the heavy membrane and cytosol fractions is similar in untreated cells (Fig. 4), the majority of B56 α protein in untreated cells is cytosolic. A possible mechanism to explain how ceramide might promote B56 α mitochondrial translocation may involve increased expression of the protein in response to ceramide. As noted earlier, B56 α is up-regulated by ceramide in HL60 cells.2 As shown in Fig.5, REH cells treated with 10 μm C2-ceramide for 3 h expressed more B56 α compared with untreated cells although there was no difference in the expression of actin. Interestingly, ceramide treatment had no effect on expression of PP2A/A (Fig. 5). Simple overexpression of B56 α cannot completely explain ceramide-mediated translocation of the protein to the mitochondrial membrane. Although there was clearly more B56 α in the heavy membrane fraction of ceramide-treated cells (as displayed in Fig. 4), there appears to be little difference in the amount of B56 α found in light membrane fractions of treated compared with untreated cells. Still, it will be important to determine the exact mechanism by which ceramide promotes B56 α mitochondrial translocation. We have demonstrated previously that although HL60 cells exhibit little (if any) mitochondrial PP2A activity, ceramide robustly promotes mitochondrial PP2A activity in HL60 cells (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To determine whether ceramide promotes mitochondrial localization of PP2A, HL60 cells were treated with ceramide, and PP2A expression was observed in subcellular fractions as described above (Fig. 4). In untreated HL60 cells little (if any) PP2A/C was found co-localized with Bcl2 in the mitochondrial membrane-containing heavy membrane fraction (Fig.6). Fig. 6 demonstrates that ceramide has little effect on Bcl2 subcellular localization. However, treatment of HL60 cells with C2-ceramide promoted localization of PP2A/C to mitochondrial membranes. The level of PP2A/C in the heavy membrane fraction of ceramide-treated cells was more than twice that of untreated cells relative to the level of mitochondrial Bcl2 as determined by densitometry of the respective bands in Fig. 6. Ceramide-induced translocation of PP2A to the mitochondrial membranes was consistent with the promotion of mitochondrial PP2A activity by ceramide as has been reported recently (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). HL60 cells treated with ceramide showed a roughly 7-fold increase in PP2A activity in isolated mitochondrial membranes (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The B56 α-subunit gene under the cytomegalovirus promoter was stably transfected into HL60 cells. Introduction of exogenous B56 α did not affect the viability of HL60 cells (data not shown). Two transfectants were obtained (i.e. clone 3 and clone 9), and both clones demonstrated higher levels of B56 α as observed in Western blot analysis of total protein lysates (Fig.7). Overexpression of B56 α resulted in greater mitochondrial PP2A activity (Fig.8). Subcellular fractions containing mitochondrial membranes were isolated, and in vitro PP2A assays were performed as described previously (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cells expressing exogenous B56 α displayed almost twice the basal level of mitochondrial PP2A activity compared with parental HL60 cells as shown in Fig. 8.Figure 8Overexpression of B56 α promotes mitochondrial PP2A activity in HL60 cells. Protein (2 μg) from isolated mitochondria was used in an in vitrophosphatase assay, and free PO4 was measured by optical density at 590 nm as described previously (11Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A standard curve with free phosphate was used to determine the amount of free phosphate generated. Phosphatase activity was defined as pmol of free PO4 generated/μg of protein/min. Error barsrepresent the mean ± S.D. from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Introduction of B56 α into HL60 cells resulted in reduced levels of basal Bcl2 phosphorylation (compare untreated parent and clone samples in Fig. 9). Furthermore, as shown in Fig.9, Bcl2 dephosphorylation was accelerated by ceramide in HL60 cells expressing exogenous B56 α. This finding suggests that B56 α overexpression promotes activity of the Bcl2 phosphatase in a ceramide-responsive manner. Consistent with previous findings correlating Bcl2 phosphorylation status and sensitivity to ceramide in HL60 cells (12Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the B56 α transfectants were more sensitive to stress induced by ceramide treatment compared with parental cells. HL60 cells overexpressing B56 α were ∼9× more sensitive to ceramide than HL60 parental cells (Fig. 10). The IC50 for ceramide in parental HL60 cells was approximately 18 μm whereas clone 9 B56 α transfectant cells displayed an IC50 of 2 μm as derived from the curve in Fig. 10. In addition, B56 α transfectant cells were at least 3× more sensitive to the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (Fig. 7). The IC50 value for parental HL60 cells treated with etoposide (after 24 h) was 14 μm, whereas clone 3 and clone 9 demonstrated IC50 values of 4 and 1 μm, respectively. These results strongly suggest that overexpression of B56 α in HL60 cells promotes mitochondrial PP2A activity resulting in reduced levels of phosphorylated (i.e. functional) Bcl2, which leads to greater chemosensitivity.Figure 10Overexpression of exogenous B56 α potentiates cell killing by ceramide. HL60 parental cells and B56 α transfectant clone 9 cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of ceramide. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining.

Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The B-subunit best defines each specific PP2A isoform because it is the most diverse subunit (18Mumby M.C.

Although there are only two variants each of the A- and C-subunits, there are at least three families of B-subunits (B, B56, and PR72/130) that are each composed of multiple isoforms (18Mumby M.C.

In addition, the B-subunit determines PP2A specificity and therefore defines the PP2A substrate target (27Cegielska A. Shaffer S. Derua R. Goris J. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4616-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It is likely, however, that physiologic specificity of the target depends more on PP2A localization than on contributions from the B-subunit because the AC catalytic complex of PP2A alone has phosphatase activity (18Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). It is possible that the regulatory B-subunit recruits PP2A catalytic core complex to sites of activity (28Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 29McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The B α-subunit is involved in translocation of PP2A to microtubules (28Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), whereas members of the B56 family are involved in nuclear translocation (29McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It is yet to be determined whether B-subunit molecules chaperone the PP2A/AC catalytic core to the mitochondria. However, findings reported here suggest that B56 α promotes mitochondrial PP2A activity, suggesting that perhaps mitochondrial PP2A activity is mediated by this B-subunit (Fig. 8). Thus, it is possible that PP2A substrates may be targeted by localization of the enzyme via the B-subunit. There is evidence that PP2A regulatory B-subunits are potential ceramide targets (35Dobrowsky R.T. Kamibayasha C. Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that ceramide may activate PP2A via the regulatory B-subunit. Data presented here demonstrate that ceramide induces PP2A/A (Figs. 3 and 6) and B56 α (Figs. 2 and 4) translocation to mitochondrial membranes where Bcl2 is present. Interestingly, the various B-subunit family members, despite a lack of sequence similarity between the families, recognize similar segments of the structural A-subunit of PP2A (37Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). The regulation of PP2A activity by the regulatory B-subunits is thus more complicated than binding to the PP2A catalytic complex. Recent studies have shown that post-translational modification of PP2A results in both positive and negative regulation of the enzyme (37Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the catalytic C-subunit results in PP2A inactivation (38Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). On the other hand, serine phosphorylation of at least one B-subunit (B56 α) appears to promote PP2A activity (39Xu Z. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5285-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Most of the members of the B56 regulatory subunit family (with the exception of the γ1 isoform) are phosphoproteins (29McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of B56 α has been shown to promote in vivo PP2A activity, at least where eukaryotic initiation factor 4E is the substrate (39Xu Z. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5285-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). How phosphorylation of B56 proteins may affect PP2A activity is not clear. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the B56 proteins does not affect their ability to bind the catalytic AC complex (29McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of B56 α has been shown to promote in vitro phosphatase activity (39Xu Z. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5285-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the effect of phosphorylation of B56 proteins on subcellular localization has not been investigated. It is possible that phosphorylation of the various B56 family members promotes translocation. The concept that ceramide can promote mitochondrial translocation of B56 α (see Fig. 2) represents indirect evidence for this notion. It is possible that ceramide promotes phosphorylation of B56 α. Ceramide has recently been found to activate the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR (30Ruvolo P.P. Gao F. Blalock W.L. Deng X. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11754-11765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Importantly, PKR recently has been shown to be a B56 α kinase (39Xu Z. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5285-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, ceramide may activate PKR resulting in B56 α phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation. A mechanism whereby PKR may regulate Bcl2 dephosphorylation via B56 α has yet to be demonstrated and is currently under investigation. Still, it is tempting to speculate that PKR and the PP2A isoform that dephosphorylates Bcl2 are functionally linked through ceramide and B56 α."

Hepatocytes are polarized epithelial cells that possess well defined canalicular and basolateral plasma membranes and are capable of rapidly transporting large volumes of water (1Meier P.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1988; 8: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bile consists of 99% water, and water transport by hepatocytes is thought to occur passively in response to local, transient, osmotic gradients generated by the active transport of osmotically active solutes, especially bile acids (2Meier P.J. Stieger B. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 89-93PubMed Google Scholar). Two pathways exist by which water could potentially move from blood to bile across the hepatocyte epithelial barrier: a paracellular pathway through the tight junctions between adjacent hepatocytes and a transcellular pathway across hepatocytes. Furthermore, transcellular water movement across individual hepatocytes could theoretically occur either by diffusion through the lipid portion of the sinusoidal and canalicular hepatocyte plasma membranes or through aquaporin water channels, proteins that span the plasma membrane and allow for bi-directional, passive flux of water in response to solute-induced osmotic gradients. The quantitative contributions of these potential pathways (i.e. paracellularversus transcellular) and mechanisms (i.e.diffusion versus channel-mediated) of water transport in hepatocytes are currently unclear.The aquaporins (AQPs)1 are a family of integral membrane proteins of ∼28 kDa, most of which function as water-selective channels. To date, 10 AQPs, numbered 0–9, have been cloned in mammals. These proteins exist in cells as homotetramers, and water molecules move bidirectionally through the central pore of each monomer in response to osmotic gradients (3Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heymann J.B. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Water channels have been shown to be expressed in many epithelial cells; typically, one or more specific AQP exists in a particular water-transporting epithelial cell and is either constitutively expressed or regulated, often by agonist-induced trafficking from an intracellular vesicular compartment to the plasma membrane allowing for rapid changes in membrane permeability, depending upon physiological needs (e.g. AQP2 in response to ADH in the tubule epithelia of the collecting duct of the kidney) (4Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 5King L. Yasui M. Agre P. Mol. Med.

LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 545-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).We originally reported that AQP1, AQP2, and AQP4 were not expressed in hepatocytes and suggested that transmembrane water transport is mainly via a non-channel-mediated pathway in the basal state (i.e.in the absence of a choleretic stimulus) (8Yano M.

Although our more recent studies, as well as those of others, have shown evidence for the presence and agonist-induced trafficking of AQP8 in hepatocytes, a comprehensive study of the expression, subcellular localization, and trafficking of all of the AQPs in hepatocytes is lacking (9Elkjaer M. Vajda Z. Nejsum L. Kwon T. Jensen U. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Elkjaer M.L.

Furthermore, the functional involvement of AQPs in canalicular water movement has not been demonstrated. The expression of multiple, differentially localized and trafficked AQPs in hepatocytes would support the notion that channel-mediated, transcellular water movement is an important mechanism for canalicular bile secretion. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to determine the expression, subcellular localization, and trafficking of AQPs in hepatocytes and to assess their role in canalicular bile formation.DISCUSSIONThe major findings reported here relate to the expression and subcellular localization of aquaporin water channels in rat hepatocytes and their possible role in canalicular bile secretion. Using molecular, biochemical, and morphological approaches in both highly purified rat hepatocytes and whole rat liver, we showed that: (i) the message and protein of three (AQP0, AQP8, and AQP9) of the 10 known AQPs are expressed in hepatocytes in variable amounts (AQP8 ≫ AQP9 > AQP0); (ii) AQP9 is found principally on the basolateral hepatocyte membrane, whereas AQP0 and AQP8 are principally localized intracellularly and to a lesser degree on the canalicular plasma membrane; (iii) AQP0 and AQP8 are expressed to a larger degree in hepatocytes surrounding the central vein, whereas AQP9 is uniformly distributed within the hepatic lobule; (iv) the amount of AQP8 in the canalicular plasma membrane markedly increases after exposure of hepatocytes to a choleretic agonist; and (v) two inhibitors of AQPs block agonist-induced (but not basal) canalicular secretion in isolated hepatocyte couplets. Our results are consistent with the notion that AQPs play a role in agonist-induced canalicular bile secretion by hepatocytes.AQPs have a wide range of tissue distribution in mammals, but their expression is most notably associated with tissues involved in the rapid transport of large volumes of water such as kidney, eye, brain, secretory glands, and more recently, colon (4Borgnia M.

Nielsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Some epithelial cells express more than one AQP with the different AQP homologues existing at different subcellular locations. Also, some AQPs undergo agonist-induced exocytic insertion and endocytic retrieval into and out of the plasma membrane as a mechanism for regulating AQP-mediated water transport. For example, the principle cells of the collecting duct in the kidney contain AQP2 in intracellular vesicles and AQP3 and AQP4 on their basolateral plasma membrane in the basal state; after exposure to vasopressin, the amount of AQP2 (but not AQP3 or AQP4) in the apical plasma membrane is increased via insertional exocytosis promoting reabsorption of water within this segment of the nephron (6Verkman A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1126-1135PubMed Google Scholar). After withdrawal of vasopressin, AQP2 molecules are removed from the apical plasma membrane by endocytosis. Similarly, the cells of the salivary and lacrimal glands contain AQP5 at the apical domain and AQP3 or AQP4 at the basolateral domain (4Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 5King L. Yasui M. Agre P. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 60-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). AQP5 in the salivary gland, which is normally sequestered in intracellular vesicles, redistributes to the apical plasma membrane upon stimulation by the neurotransmitter, epinephrine (24Ishikawa Y. Showronski M.T. Inoue N. Ishida H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, we have demonstrated that AQP4 is constitutively expressed on the basolateral membrane of cholangiocytes, whereas AQP1, normally residing in intracellular vesicles, undergoes secretin-induced exocytic insertion into the apical cholangiocyte membrane (15Marinelli R. Tietz P. Pham L. Rueckert L. Agre P. LaRusso N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 39: G280-G286Google Scholar, 25Marinelli R.A. Pham L. Agre P. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, a generalizable model accounting for the physiological role of AQPs in water-transporting epithelia is developing in which multiple, differentially localized, constitutively expressed or trafficked AQPs function together to facilitate regulated transcellular water movement in water-transporting epithelia in both the basal and stimulated states.d-cAMP has been shown to stimulate canalicular bile secretion in the perfused rat liver (27Hayakawa T. Bruck R., Ng, O. Boyer J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G727-G735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in isolated rat hepatocyte couplets (28Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1600-1611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that cAMP stimulates the canalicular targeting of vesicles containing the Cl−/HCO3− (29Benedetti A. Strazzabosco M., Ng, O. Boyer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the bile salt export pump (28Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1600-1611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the organic anion transporter, Mrp2 (30Roelofsen H. Soroka C. Keppler D. Boyer J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Soroka C. Pate M. Boyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26416-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), processes that may underlie the choleretic effect of cAMP. In this study, we showed that d-cAMP stimulated the insertion of AQP8-containing vesicles into the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. We propose that this process facilitates the movement of water coupled to the secretion of osmotically active solutes and, in turn, the elaboration of canalicular bile.We found that AQP0 was present in hepatocytes and was localized principally to intracellular vesicles and that, unlike AQP8, this localization was unaffected by d-cAMP. This protein had previously been thought to be expressed exclusively in the lens fiber cells of the eye where it functions as a water channel of low permeability but also as a structural protein important in cell-cell adhesion (32Fotiadis D. Hasler L. Muller D. Stahlberg H. Kistler J. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The significance of AQP0 expression in hepatocytes is currently unclear, but we speculate that its role may be unrelated to canalicular bile secretion.Recently, we showed that AQP8 is localized largely to intracellular vesicles within isolated hepatocytes in the unstimulated state and was redistributed to the hepatocyte plasma membrane via stimulation with d-cAMP (11Garcia F. Kierbel A. Larocca M. Gradilone S. Splinter P. LaRusso N. Marinelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12147-12152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our results here extend these findings by demonstrating that the canalicular membrane is the specific domain of the plasma membrane into which the insertion of AQP8 occurs. This mechanism of regulation may allow hepatocytes to quickly and selectively increase the osmotic permeability of their canalicular plasma membrane in response to a choleretic stimulus. AQP8 expression has also been demonstrated on the luminal side of seminiferous tubules, the apical membrane of pancreatic acinar cells, and in both absorptive epithelia of the colon and acinar cells of the salivary gland; whether AQP8 in these tissues is also regulated by a trafficking mechanism has not been explored (10Elkjaer M.L.

Tamamoto T. Arch. Histol.

Vajda Z. Nejsum L. Kwon T. Jensen U. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our results support this topography using multiple experimental techniques, but also show that AQP9 localization does not change in response to a choleretic stimulus. This constitutively basolateral localization of AQP9 is thought to facilitate trans-basolateral water movement, a critical component of transcellular movement of water across hepatocytes. Other studies have shown AQP9 to be expressed in epididymus, testis, spleen, and brain, but the subcellular location of AQP9 in these cell types is unclear.Historically, water transport in hepatocytes has been assumed by many to occur via a paracellular pathway (i.e. between cells). This assumption was based on evidence involving tight junction penetration of nonaqueous substances and on in vitroelectrical resistance measurements suggesting that hepatocytes are “leaky epithelia” (37Boyer J.

More recently, we suggested that transcellular water movement might account for the high osmotic permeability coefficient of isolated hepatocytes (i.e. P f = 66.4 × μm/s) we previously observed from careful measurements. This value is actually higher, for example, than that of cholangiocytes (i.e. P f= 50.0 × μm/s), which we have shown to transport water via a transcellular, channel-mediated pathway (20Cova E. Gong A. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Roberts S. Yano M. Ueno Y. Pham L. Alpini G. Agre P. LaRusso N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13009-13013Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that the transcellular mechanism by which hepatocytes transported water was mainly via a non-channel-mediated pathway (i.e. via the lipid phase) in the basal state (8Yano M. Marinelli R. Roberts S. Balan V. Pham L. Tarara J. deGroen P. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6702-6707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on careful measurements demonstrating a temperature dependence of hepatocyte membrane permeability and on an apparent lack of water channel expression. The calculated activation energy (E a) from these experiments was 12.8 kcal/mol (outside of the typical range for channel-mediated transport) and was decreased to 3.6 kcal/mol in the presence of amphotericin B, a substance that forms artificial water channels in plasma membranes. Our functional studies here using AQP inhibitors also support the concept that transcellular water transport by hepatocytes in the basal state occurs mainly via a non-channel-mediated pathway. Our discovery of the expression of three water channels with distinct subcellular locations within hepatocytes and our data demonstrating that the insertion of AQP8 into the canalicular plasma membrane can be stimulated by a choleretic agonist suggest that water transport across the hepatocyte epithelial barrier in response to a choleretic stimulus (as opposed to the basal, unstimulated state) is due to a transcellular pathway facilitated by the regulated and constitutive expression of AQP8 and AQP9, respectively. The role of AQP0, which appears to be localized primarily in intracellular vesicles, remains obscure. Indeed, we have now demonstrated that in addition to the diffusional and paracellular routes, a regulated, channel-mediated component for water transport by hepatocytes also exists (Fig. 8). The quantitative contributions of these various pathways to total canalicular bile secretion is under active investigation.In summary, our findings show that hepatocytes express multiple differentially localized and differentially trafficked AQPs, a pattern increasingly being recognized in water transporting epithelial cells. Although hepatocyte water movement appears to be non-channel-mediated in the basal state, d-cAMP-induced water secretion can be abrogated by inhibitors of AQPs. The data suggest that water channels play an important role in the transcellular transport of water during primary bile secretion by the hepatocyte. Further studies will be necessary to determine the quantitative contribution of channel-mediated water movement relative to diffusion across and movement between hepatocytes, as well as the exact role and mechanism of regulation for each AQP homologue. Primary bile is secreted by hepatocytes at the bile canaliculus and is modified via absorption and secretion of water, ions, and solutes by cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells that line the intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatocytes are polarized epithelial cells that possess well defined canalicular and basolateral plasma membranes and are capable of rapidly transporting large volumes of water (1Meier P.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1988; 8: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bile consists of 99% water, and water transport by hepatocytes is thought to occur passively in response to local, transient, osmotic gradients generated by the active transport of osmotically active solutes, especially bile acids (2Meier P.J. Stieger B. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 89-93PubMed Google Scholar). Two pathways exist by which water could potentially move from blood to bile across the hepatocyte epithelial barrier: a paracellular pathway through the tight junctions between adjacent hepatocytes and a transcellular pathway across hepatocytes. Furthermore, transcellular water movement across individual hepatocytes could theoretically occur either by diffusion through the lipid portion of the sinusoidal and canalicular hepatocyte plasma membranes or through aquaporin water channels, proteins that span the plasma membrane and allow for bi-directional, passive flux of water in response to solute-induced osmotic gradients. The quantitative contributions of these potential pathways (i.e. paracellularversus transcellular) and mechanisms (i.e.diffusion versus channel-mediated) of water transport in hepatocytes are currently unclear. The aquaporins (AQPs)1 are a family of integral membrane proteins of ∼28 kDa, most of which function as water-selective channels. To date, 10 AQPs, numbered 0–9, have been cloned in mammals. These proteins exist in cells as homotetramers, and water molecules move bidirectionally through the central pore of each monomer in response to osmotic gradients (3Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heymann J.B. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Water channels have been shown to be expressed in many epithelial cells; typically, one or more specific AQP exists in a particular water-transporting epithelial cell and is either constitutively expressed or regulated, often by agonist-induced trafficking from an intracellular vesicular compartment to the plasma membrane allowing for rapid changes in membrane permeability, depending upon physiological needs (e.g. AQP2 in response to ADH in the tubule epithelia of the collecting duct of the kidney) (4Borgnia M.

We originally reported that AQP1, AQP2, and AQP4 were not expressed in hepatocytes and suggested that transmembrane water transport is mainly via a non-channel-mediated pathway in the basal state (i.e.in the absence of a choleretic stimulus) (8Yano M.

Although our more recent studies, as well as those of others, have shown evidence for the presence and agonist-induced trafficking of AQP8 in hepatocytes, a comprehensive study of the expression, subcellular localization, and trafficking of all of the AQPs in hepatocytes is lacking (9Elkjaer M.

Furthermore, the functional involvement of AQPs in canalicular water movement has not been demonstrated. The expression of multiple, differentially localized and trafficked AQPs in hepatocytes would support the notion that channel-mediated, transcellular water movement is an important mechanism for canalicular bile secretion. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to determine the expression, subcellular localization, and trafficking of AQPs in hepatocytes and to assess their role in canalicular bile formation. DISCUSSIONThe major findings reported here relate to the expression and subcellular localization of aquaporin water channels in rat hepatocytes and their possible role in canalicular bile secretion. Using molecular, biochemical, and morphological approaches in both highly purified rat hepatocytes and whole rat liver, we showed that: (i) the message and protein of three (AQP0, AQP8, and AQP9) of the 10 known AQPs are expressed in hepatocytes in variable amounts (AQP8 ≫ AQP9 > AQP0); (ii) AQP9 is found principally on the basolateral hepatocyte membrane, whereas AQP0 and AQP8 are principally localized intracellularly and to a lesser degree on the canalicular plasma membrane; (iii) AQP0 and AQP8 are expressed to a larger degree in hepatocytes surrounding the central vein, whereas AQP9 is uniformly distributed within the hepatic lobule; (iv) the amount of AQP8 in the canalicular plasma membrane markedly increases after exposure of hepatocytes to a choleretic agonist; and (v) two inhibitors of AQPs block agonist-induced (but not basal) canalicular secretion in isolated hepatocyte couplets. Our results are consistent with the notion that AQPs play a role in agonist-induced canalicular bile secretion by hepatocytes.AQPs have a wide range of tissue distribution in mammals, but their expression is most notably associated with tissues involved in the rapid transport of large volumes of water such as kidney, eye, brain, secretory glands, and more recently, colon (4Borgnia M.

Some epithelial cells express more than one AQP with the different AQP homologues existing at different subcellular locations. Also, some AQPs undergo agonist-induced exocytic insertion and endocytic retrieval into and out of the plasma membrane as a mechanism for regulating AQP-mediated water transport. For example, the principle cells of the collecting duct in the kidney contain AQP2 in intracellular vesicles and AQP3 and AQP4 on their basolateral plasma membrane in the basal state; after exposure to vasopressin, the amount of AQP2 (but not AQP3 or AQP4) in the apical plasma membrane is increased via insertional exocytosis promoting reabsorption of water within this segment of the nephron (6Verkman A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1126-1135PubMed Google Scholar). After withdrawal of vasopressin, AQP2 molecules are removed from the apical plasma membrane by endocytosis. Similarly, the cells of the salivary and lacrimal gl"

Here, we report that one of these subunits, TRPL, is translocated back and forth between the signaling membrane and an intracellular compartment by a light-regulated mechanism. A high level of rhabdomeral TRPL, characteristic of dark-raised flies, is functionally manifested in the properties of the light-induced current. These flies are more sensitive than flies with no or reduced TRPL level to dim background lights, and they respond to a wider range of light intensities, which fit them to function better in darkness or dim background illumination. Thus, TRPL translocation represents a novel mechanism to fine tune visual responses."

Briefly, peritoneal lavage was performed with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After the lavage fluid was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, the cells were cultured in Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The non-adherent cells were removed by extensive washing. The adherent cells were collected by dispersion with 0.53 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution, re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, seeded at 1 × 106 cells onto a glass coverslip (13-mm diameter) in 24-well plates, and cultured for 18 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (HBSA2+) and incubated with 2.5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the presence of 2.5 mm probenecid for 30 min at 37 °C. After the cells were labeled, the coverslips were washed and placed in a diagonal position in a standard 1-cm square methacrylate cuvette containing 2 ml of HBSA2+. The cuvette was fitted with a rubber O-ring to position the coverslip just above a magnetic stirring bar. The cells were stimulated with LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) or ATP (Sigma). Fluorescence output was measured with excitation at 340 and 380 nm in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-4500, Japan), and the relative ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm was recorded. Assays of the cellular response to LTC4 were performed in the presence of 50 mmserine-borate to inhibit the conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 (28Tate S.S. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4806-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Each mouse received an intravenous injection of 0.5% Evans blue dye (10 ml of dye solution/kg of body weight) in PBS immediately before the intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of zymosan A suspension (1 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma). Mice were euthanized by CO2 before and 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the injection of zymosan A and underwent peritoneal lavage with 4 ml of cold PBS. Each peritoneal lavage fluid was divided equally into two tubes, 2 ml for Evans blue dye extravasation and cell counts and 2 ml for the myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. Cells were sedimented from the lavage fluid by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and Evans blue dye extravasation was assessed by light spectrophotometry of the supernatants at 610 nm. The cell pellets were suspended in 100 μl of PBS, and the cells were counted. Cells (2 × 104) were cytospun onto a glass slide, stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL), and analyzed for cell types. The total neutrophils in the lavage fluid were calculated from the percentage of the cell type and the total cell count. The cell pellets from 2 ml of the lavage fluid were suspended in 200 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) with 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma), frozen and thawed three times, and sonicated at level 3 for 1 min at 4 °C with a Branson sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT). The supernatants of the cell extracts were assayed for MPO as described (29Bradley P.P. Priebat D.A. Christensen R.D. Rothstein G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 78: 206-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3036) Google Scholar, 30Rao T.S. Currie J.L. Shaffer A.F. Isakson P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Prostaglandins. 1985; 30: 769-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of diluted samples were added to a 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 190 μl of assay buffer containing 0.167 mg/ml of o-dianosidine (Sigma) and 0.0005% hydrogen peroxide. The rate of change of absorbance at 405 nm was monitored in kinetic mode, and Vmax was calculated by a plate reader (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA). Levels of MPO were determined from the calibration curve with human neutrophil MPO (Sigma) as a standard. The LTC4S(−/−) and LTC4S(+/+) male mice (7Kanaoka Y. Maekawa A. Penrose J.F. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22608-22613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) used for the MPO assay and cell counts were from the intercrossing of LTC4S(+/−) males and females that had been backcrossed to the C57BL/6 strain at the N5 generation. Mice received intradermal injections of 25 ng of mouse monoclonal anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE in 25 μl of saline in the right ear and 25 μl of saline only in the left ear. After 20 h, mice were injected intravenously with 100 μg of DNP-human serum albumin and 1% Evans blue dye in 100 μl of PBS. The mice were euthanized 15 and 30 min after the intravenous injection, and a 6-mm-diameter disc of tissue was obtained from the center of each ear. Each disc was incubated in 200 μl of formamide at 55 °C for 48 h. Extravasation of Evans blue dye was quantitated by spectrophotometric analysis of the formamide extracts at 610 nm, and vascular permeability enhancement was calculated as the net difference between the sensitized and control ears. The results of the experiments were expressed as means ± S.E. Student's t test was used for the statistical analysis in cases in which the variance was homogeneous, and Welch's test was used when the variance was heterogeneous. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The targeting vector was designed so that the neo gene insertion interrupts the coding region that is common to the long and short isoforms of the mouse CysLT1R gene (Ref. 20Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Lam B.K. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2256-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A). Out of 31 embryonic stem cell clones that survived in the presence of G418 and ganciclovir, two were identified as targeted clones by Southern blot analysis for the 4.8-kilobase (kb) band. The embryonic stem cell clones were microinjected into BALB/c-derived blastocysts. Two male chimeric mice (>70% chimerism by coat color) were obtained from each clone and bred to C57BL/6 females. Since the CysLT1R gene is on the X chromosome, heterozygotes obtained at F1 generation were female. The heterozygous females were bred to C57BL/6 males to obtain CysLT1R(−) males. These CysLT1R(−) males were further bred to CysLT1R(+/−) females. Southern blot analysis of ScaI-digested DNA from the progeny demonstrated a 4.8-kb band for the disrupted gene and a 4.0-kb band for the wild-type gene; it also revealed that the ratio was 1:1 for CysLT1R(−) and CysLT1R(+) males and for CysLT1R(−/−) and CysLT1R(+/−) females, respectively, as illustrated for one litter (Fig. 1B). The CysLT1R(−) males and CysLT1R(−/−) females developed normally and were fertile. Since mouse CysLT1R mRNA is most abundantly expressed in the lung (20Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Lam B.K. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2256-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we examined whether homologous recombination by the targeting vector disrupted expression of the CysLT1R mRNA in the lung. By Northern blot analysis with total RNAs, CysLT1R mRNA was not detected in CysLT1R(−) mice, whereas mRNAs with sizes of 1.4 and 4.0 kb were detected in the lung of CysLT1R(+) mice (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that the transcript from the recombinant allele is unstable due to displacement of 278 bp of the coding region by the neo gene. To seek functional evidence of the effect of the CysLT1R gene disruption, we utilized cysLT-evoked intracellular calcium mobilization in peritoneal macrophages, which expressed both CysLT1R and CysLT2R mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR (24Ogasawara H. Ishii S. Yokomizo T. Kakinuma T. Komine M. Tamaki K. Shimizu T. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18763-18768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The macrophages from wild-type mice showed a rapid intracellular calcium flux in response to stimulation with 1 × 10−6m LTD4 (Fig. 2A), a lesser signal in response to 1 × 10−6m LTC4(Fig. 2B) or LTE4 (data not shown), and no response to LTB4 (data not shown). The preference for LTD4 is consistent with the ligand profile obtained with Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing either the long or the short isoform of the mouse CysLT1R cDNA (20Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Lam B.K. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2256-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, the macrophages from the CysLT1R(−) mice did not show an intracellular calcium flux in response to stimulation with either 1 × 10−6m LTD4 (Fig. 2C) or LTC4 (Fig. 2D). That macrophages from the CysLT1R(−) mice showed a prominent intracellular calcium flux to ATP indicates that the signal transduction mechanism for intracellular calcium flux is intact. These results indicate that CysLT1R is the major receptor for cysLTs in peritoneal macrophages. That LTD4 can stimulate rat alveolar macrophages in vitro to increase the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, has suggested a priming function of the cysLTs (32Ménard G. Bissonnette E.Y. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mouse alveolar (33Rouzer C.A. Scott W.A. Hamill A.L. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp.

More recently, CysLT1R expression has been recognized on human alveolar macrophages (16Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q., Im, D.-S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M. Coulombe N. Abramovitz M. Figueroa D.J. Zeng Z.

A. 2001; 98: 7964-7969Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) by immunodetection. Moreover, LTC4 and LTD4 can stimulate interleukin (IL)-4-primed human mast cells to transcribe and release cytokines, such as IL-5, TNF-α, and MIP-1β. The CysLT1R antagonist, MK-571, not only blocks this induction of proinflammatory cytokines by exogenous cysLTs, but also partially inhibits their expression followed by FcεRI-mediated activation, revealing that CysLT1R mediates both innate and adaptive immune responses (38Mellor E.A. Austen K.F. Boyce J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The close developmental relationship of mast cells and monocytes (39Kempuraj D. Saito H. Kaneko A.

Blood. 1999; 94: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that CysLT1R may have a similar effector function for macrophages. Furthermore, CysLT1R expression can be up-regulated by IL-4 and IL-13 in human peripheral blood monocytes (41Thivierge M. Staňková J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2855-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and by IL-5 in eosinophil-differentiated HL-60 cells (42Thivierge M. Doty M. Johnson J. Staňková J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5221-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These findings imply that CysLT1R may contribute to the cellular phase of a Th2 cell-driven inflammatory response by augmenting production of inflammatory cytokines by immune effector cells. We examined the role of CysLT1R in the in vivo monocyte/macrophage-dependent inflammatory response to zymosan A-induced peritoneal inflammation (30Rao T.S. Currie J.L. Shaffer A.F. Isakson P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 917-925PubMed Google Scholar,31Doherty N.S. Poubelle P. Borgeat P. Beaver T.H. Westrich G.L. Schrader N.L. Prostaglandins. 1985; 30: 769-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Plasma protein extravasation assessed 30–240 min after zymosan A injection was significantly suppressed in CysLT1R(−) mice at all time points as compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. 3A). This result was essentially identical to that obtained with LTC4S null mice, which lack the capacity to generate cysLTs (7Kanaoka Y. Maekawa A. Penrose J.F. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22608-22613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We also examined neutrophil infiltration, which is generally apparent at 120 min and peaks at 240 min after the injection of zymosan A (25Shi Z.-Z. Han B. Habib G.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,30Rao T.S. Currie J.L. Shaffer A.F. Isakson P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

As assessed at these time points with either neutrophil counts or MPO activity, there was no significant difference in neutrophil infiltration between CysLT1R(−) and (+) mice (Fig. 3B, left). The findings were similar for the LTC4S(−/−) mice (Fig. 3B, right), which do not generate cysLTs but do provide LTB4 (7Kanaoka Y. Maekawa A. Penrose J.F. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22608-22613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because of a study showing that plasma protein extravasation in response to zymosan A-induced intraperitoneal inflammation is intact while neutrophil accumulation is attenuated in γ-glutamyl leukotrienase null mice (25Shi Z.-Z. Han B. Habib G.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), our results could imply that the LTC4-CysLT1R signal is sufficient to increase vascular permeability but not for neutrophil-directed function. However, our additional finding that intraperitoneal neutrophil accumulation is intact in LTC4S null mice 120 and 240 min after zymosan A injection suggests that cysLTs are not critical to this response in our strains. Our results indicate that a cysLT-CysLT1R-initiated stimulus plays a major role in the early phase of plasma protein extravasation, but not in the neutrophil infiltration that follows in a later phase of zymosan A-induced peritoneal inflammation. Because we previously demonstrated that the edema induced in the ears of LTC4S null mice by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis is reduced by 50% as compared with their wild-type littermates (7Kanaoka Y. Maekawa A. Penrose J.F. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22608-22613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we next determined whether the CysLT1R is critical to the alteration of vascular permeability in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis by using CysLT1R-deficient mice. Preliminary experiments revealed that a change of ear thickness after the antigen challenge is more difficult to detect in C57BL/6 mice than in BALB/c or FVB mice, and therefore we used Evans blue dye extravasation to detect the plasma protein leakage induced by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (44Feinberg J.G. Nature. 1961; 191: 712Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 45Inagaki N. Goto S. Nagai H. Koda A. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1984; 74: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 46Inagaki N. Goto S. Yamasaki M. Nagai H. Koda A. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1986; 81: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Evans blue dye extravasation in the ear of CysLT1R-deficient mice was reduced by ∼50% at 15 min and by ∼80% at 30 min after antigen challenge as compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the increased vascular permeability mediated by cysLTs in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis significantly involves their action through the CysLT1R. We produced CysLT1R-deficient mice by using C57BL/6 strain-derived embryonic stem cells because the X-linked location of the gene allowed generation of strain purity for F1heterozygous females. Another advantage of using the C57BL/6 strain for phenotypic analyses of the gene-disrupted mice could be the recent finding that in this strain the expression levels of CysLT1R and CysLT2R are higher than in the 129 strain (24Ogasawara H. Ishii S. Yokomizo T. Kakinuma T. Komine M. Tamaki K. Shimizu T. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18763-18768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We then demonstrated that CysLT1R is the major functional CysLT receptor on peritoneal macrophages by the intracellular calcium mobilization assay. Finally, our in vivo findings with the CysLT1R gene-disrupted mice reveal a major role for the cysLTs-CysLT1R signal in innate and adaptive immune responses of vascular permeability enhancement during zymosan A-induced peritoneal inflammation and IgE-mediated, mast cell-dependent local anaphylaxis. We thank Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for providing C57BL/6 mouse embryonic stem cells, Dr. Arlene Sharpe and Lina Du (Brigham and Women's Hospital) for blastocyst injection of the embryonic stem cell clones, and Dr. Daniel Friend (Brigham and Women's Hospital) for cytological analysis of the peritoneal lavage fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2083417353,"The interfacial sequence DKWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK, preceding the transmembrane anchor of gp41 glycoprotein subunit, has been shown to be essential for fusion activity and incorporation into virions. HIV(c), a peptide representing this region, formed lytic pores in liposomes composed of the main lipids occurring in the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), envelope, i.e. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC):sphingomyelin (SPM):cholesterol (Chol) (1:1:1 mole ratio), at low (>1:10,000) peptide-to-lipid mole ratio, and promoted the mixing of vesicular lipids at >1:1000 peptide-to-lipid mole ratios. Inclusion of SPM or Chol in POPC membranes had different effects. Whereas SPM sustained pore formation, Chol promoted fusion activity. Even if partitioning into membranes was not affected in the absence of both SPM and Chol, HIV(c) had virtually no effect on POPC vesicles. Conditions described to disturb occurrence of lateral separation of phases in these systems reproduced the high peptide-dose requirements for leakage as found in pure POPC vesicles and inhibited fusion. Surface aggregation assays using rhodamine-labeled peptides demonstrated that SPM and Chol promoted HIV(c) self-aggregation in membranes. Employing head-group fluorescent phospholipid analogs in planar supported lipid layers, we were able to discern HIV(c) clusters associated to ordered domains. Our results support the notion that the pretransmembrane sequence may participate in the clustering of gp41 monomers within the HIV-1 envelope, and in bilayer architecture destabilization at the loci of fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2149946849,"In the Drosophila circadian clock, daily cycles in the RNA levels of dclock (dClk) are antiphase to those of period (per). We altered the timing/levels of dClk expression by generating transgenic flies whereby per circadian regulatory sequences were used to drive rhythmic transcription of dClk. The results indicate that posttranscriptional mechanisms make substantial contributions to the temporal changes in the abundance of the dCLK protein. Circadian regulation is largely unaffected in the transgenic per-dClk flies despite higher mean levels of dCLK. However, in per-dClk flies the duration of morning activity is lengthened in light-dark cycles and light pulses evoke longer lasting bouts of activity. Our findings suggest that, in addition to a role in generating circadian rhythms, dCLK modulates the direct effects of light on locomotion."

A conformational switch in the I domain allosteric site (IDAS) and in CD18 regulates LFA-1 affinity for endothelial ligands including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). We examined the dynamics of CD18 activation in terms of the efficiency of neutrophil capture of ICAM-1, and we correlated this with the membrane topography of 327C, an antibody that recognizes the active conformation of CD18 I-like domain. Adhesion increased in direct proportion to chemotactic stimulus rising 7-fold over a log range of interleukin-8 (IL-8). A threshold dose of ∼75 pm IL-8, corresponding to ligation of only ∼10–100 receptors, was sufficient to activate ∼20,000 CD18 and a rapid boost in the capture efficiency on ICAM-1. This was accompanied by a rapid redistribution of active LFA-1, but not Mac-1, into membrane patches, a necessary component for optimum adhesion efficiency. Shear-resistant arrest on a monolayer of ICAM-1 was reversed within minutes of chemotactic stimulation correlating with a shift from high to low affinity CD18 and dispersal of patches of active CD18. Mobility of active CD18 into high avidity patches was dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and not F-actin polymerization.

This cascade of cell responses that hinge on activation of CD18 is critical to neutrophil arrest on the endothelium as evidenced by leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) patients who manifest a diminished or absent immune response at sites of inflammation (12von Andrian U.H.

An increase in avidity of LFA-1 on lymphocytes has been shown to support cell rolling on a cellular substrate of ICAM-1 in the shear field of a parallel plate flow chamber (16Sigal A. Bleijs D.A. Grabovsky V. van Vliet S.J. Dwir O. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Alon R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Published data also indicate that firm adhesion of neutrophils to ICAM-1 involves a cooperative and sequential process of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18)-dependent capture followed by Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18)-mediated stabilization (17Hentzen E.R. Neelamegham S. Kansas G.S. Benanti J.A. McIntire L.V. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. Blood. 1999; 95: 911-920Crossref Google Scholar). This occurs within seconds of chemotactic stimulation of cell suspensions sheared in a cone-plate viscometer over a range of stress typical of blood flow in the microcirculation (∼0.2–1.5 dynes/cm2) (17Hentzen E.R. Neelamegham S. Kansas G.S. Benanti J.A. McIntire L.V. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. Blood. 1999; 95: 911-920Crossref Google Scholar). Studies in the microcirculation have corroborated the flow chamber data revealing that LFA-1 is sufficient for the transition from leukocyte rolling to arrest in the inflamed microcirculation of the mouse (18Henderson R.B.

Blood. 2002; 99: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Leukocyte stimulation by chemokines triggers a high affinity conformation and an increase in the lateral mobility of CD18, resulting in formation of receptor clustering on the membrane (20Constantin G. Majeed M. Giagulli C. Piccio L. Kim J.Y. Butcher E.C. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Both of these mechanisms can elicit the arrest of circulating lymphocytes (20Constantin G. Majeed M. Giagulli C. Piccio L. Kim J.Y. Butcher E.C. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). LFA-1 occurs at the I domain metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) (21McDowall A. Leitinger B. Stanley P. Bates P.A. Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27396-27403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An allosteric shift in LFA-1 to a conformation that supports high affinity ligand binding was recently shown to localize to a site spatially distinct from the MIDAS, which is denoted the IDAS (15Lupher M.L., Jr. Harris E.A. Beals C.R. Sui L. Liddington R.C. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A.

This allosteric shift in the LFA-1 heterodimer resulted in a 6-fold increase in the Kd of binding of soluble LFA-1 to ICAM-1 (15Lupher M.L., Jr. Harris E.A. Beals C.R. Sui L. Liddington R.C. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Binding of a unique CD18 mAb 240Q was also found to induce a high affinity conformation of LFA-1. A CD18 I-like domain (βI) mAb, 327C, was shown to report on the active conformation induced by soluble ICAM-1, IDAS activating mutation or 240Q (14Beals C.R. Edwards A.C. Gottschalk R.J. Kuijpers T.W. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6113-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Lupher M.L., Jr. Harris E.A. Beals C.R. Sui L. Liddington R.C. Staunton D.E. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The induction of the βI domain 327C epitope was blocked by a small molecule diarylsulfied inhibitor that binds to the IDAS (14Beals C.R. Edwards A.C. Gottschalk R.J. Kuijpers T.W. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6113-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus the IDAS conformation switch is conformationally linked to CD18 βI domain conformation. In addition, regulation at the IDAS is dominant to cellular activation of LFA-1 (15Lupher M.L., Jr. Harris E.A. Beals C.R. Sui L. Liddington R.C. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Taken together the data support a mechanism by which cellular activation of an LFA-1 high affinity state that supports cell adhesion is regulated by a conformational switch(s) at the IDAS and βI domain (22Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher M.L., Jr. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite a wealth of evidence indicating that conformational activation of β2 integrin plays a central role in neutrophil recruitment during acute inflammation, the precise mechanisms that lead from GPCR signaling to shear-resistant arrest are not entirely known. For example, the relations between IL-8 receptor ligation, the rate of activation of CD18, and the dynamics of neutrophil adhesion have not been systematically studied. Yet, formation of bonds in sufficient numbers may provide a critical gatekeeper in regulating the efficiency of the transition from cell rolling to shear-resistant arrest, a prerequisite for transendothelial migration (24Jung U. Norman K.E. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Beaudet A.L. Ley K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined neutrophil capture and firm adhesion to ICAM-1 via LFA-1 and Mac-1 in response to stimulation with IL-8 and allosteric activation by mAb 240Q. To examine the process of collisional capture of neutrophils, a flow cytometric based assay was employed to detect adhesion of fluorescent microbeads coated with ICAM-1. The strength and stability of neutrophil adhesion to an ICAM-1-expressing cellular substrate was imaged in a parallel plate flow chamber as a function of applied shear stress. By correlating the dynamics of adhesion with the expression and membrane distribution of mAb 327C reporting on activated CD18, we show that IL-8 stimulation regulates neutrophil recruitment on ICAM-1 through changes in LFA-1 affinity and membrane mobility. Whole blood was obtained from healthy adult individuals by venipuncture into sterile syringes with heparin (10 units/ml of blood, Elkins-Sinn, Inc., Cherry Hill, NJ) using the University of California, Davis, approved human subjects protocol (Protocol Identification 993120). Neutrophils were isolated from whole blood using a one-step Ficoll-Paque density gradient (Mono-Poly Resolving medium, ICN, Aurora, OH, or PMN, Robbins Scientific Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) following the manufacturers' protocols. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood using a one-step sodium metrizoate/Ficoll density gradient (Lympho Sep, ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol with the following modification. Blood was diluted 2-fold with PBS prior to layering on the separation media. Following isolation, neutrophils were washed once with HEPES buffer (10 mm KCl, 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mmMgCl2, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and PBMC were washed 3 times with PBS by centrifugation at 300 × g for 8 min. The PBMC or neutrophils were resuspended in HEPES buffer (∼2.5 × 107 cells/ml). Endotoxin was removed from the buffer by affinity chromatography over polymyxin B-Sepharose (Pierce). Neutrophils and PBMC were maintained at room temperature in a calcium-free HEPES buffer. Neutrophils were assessed by trypan blue exclusion and deemed to be >98% viable. Following cell isolation, neutrophils were found to remain unactivated at room temperature for ∼4 h after separation. The criteria was that incubation for 20 min at 37 °C yielded less than 10% of Mac-1 up-regulation. Transfected L cells expressing human ICAM-1, as described by Gopalan et al. (25Gopalan P.K. Smith C.W., Lu, H. Berg E.L. McIntire L.V. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 367-375PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in a modified RPMI media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 50× HAT solution (Sigma). These transfected L cells expressed ∼600 ICAM-1 sites/μm2. Transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human Mac-1 (CHO-Mac-1), as described by Tim A. Springer (26Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and generously provided by Celetta G. Callaway (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), were maintained in a modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 16 μmthymidine, 0.1 μm methotrexate, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. CHO-K1 cells (ATCC CCL-61), also provided by Celetta G. Callaway, were maintained in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were detached by incubation in 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA, washed, and resuspended in HEPES buffer. Recombinant human ICAM-1/Fc was produced at the ICOS Corp. (Bothell, WA), as described previously (22Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher M.L., Jr. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). IL-8 (72 amino acid) was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Adhesion blocking monoclonal antibodies, R15.7 (anti-CD18) and R3.1 (anti-LFA-1), were generously provided by Dr. Robert Rothlein (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Ridgefield, CT). 2LPM19c (anti-Mac-1) was purchased through Dako (Carpenteria, CA). For inhibition of adhesive function, blocking antibodies were used in the following concentrations: R15.7 and R3.1 at 10 μg/ml and 2LPM19c at 6 μg/ml (27Neelamegham S. Taylor A.D. Burns A.R. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. Blood. 1998; 92: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stacker S.A. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). Activating antibody 240Q (ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA), which binds CD18 and induces an active conformation (22Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher M.L., Jr. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), was used at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 5 μg/ml representing 3–30% binding of total CD18, respectively. Adhesion blocking and activating antibodies were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with cells unless otherwise noted. Antibody 327C (ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA) binds CD18 at the I domain and reports on a neoepitope expressed on the active binding site and was used at 10 μg/ml (15Lupher M.L., Jr. Harris E.A. Beals C.R. Sui L. Liddington R.C. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 327C was labeled with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) following the manufacturer's protocol. For immunofluorescence studies, we used PE anti-human CD11a (BD PharMingen), anti-Mac-1 mAb 2LPM19c-RPE (Dako, Carpenteria, CA), or biotinylated 327C followed by neutravidin FITC (Pierce) at 1:75 dilution. To study the effect of CD18 mobility on neutrophil adhesion, neutrophils were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.1% Me2SO (vehicle control), cytochalasin B (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA), or wortmannin (Alexis Corp.) or LY294002 (Alexis Corp.) diluted in 0.1% Me2SO. Cytochalasin B disrupts the formation of F-actin, whereas wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit PI(3)K activity. Neutrophil adhesion to ICAM-1 was measured in a parallel plate flow chamber that produces a uniform laminar flow field as described previously (29Abbassi O. Kishimoto T.K. McIntire L.V. Anderson D.C. Smith C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2719-2730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, L cells expressing ICAM-1 were grown to confluence on 35 mm untreated glass cover slips, washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS containing 11 mm glucose, and mounted on the flow chamber as described previously (25Gopalan P.K. Smith C.W., Lu, H. Berg E.L. McIntire L.V. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 367-375PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils (1.5 × 106) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 240Q at indicated concentrations, incubated for an additional 2 min at 37 °C, then stimulated with IL-8 at indicated concentrations, and injected as a bolus into the flow chamber. Neutrophils were allowed to sediment to the monolayer in the absence of shear stress. Shear stress was initially set at 0.1 dyne/cm2 for an additional minute to promote interactions with the monolayer substrate and then ramped to 4 dynes/cm2 to assess the strength and stability of adhesion. Image sequences were captured (in a phase separated field of view) for 30 s (4 frames/s) throughout the period of applied shear using a Nikon TE200 inverted microscope equipped with a Plan Fluor 20× objective and a cooled CCD camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN). Images were compiled directly into digital sequences using a frame grabber (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and then analyzed using Image Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The number of adherent neutrophils per field of view was quantitated by identifying their phase-bright appearance in the same focal plane as the monolayer (Fig. 1 a). Adherent neutrophils were defined as those neutrophils that moved less than one cell diameter in 30 s. This fraction of arrested cells was normalized to the average of the total number of neutrophils, both adherent and rolling, present in the field of views of the first two time points (0.1 dyne/cm2 time samples). To provide a quantitative measure of CD18-dependent capture of ICAM-1, fluorescent latex beads (1 μm diameter, Fluospheres, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) coated with protein A were derivatized with recombinant human ICAM-1/Fc. Beads were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS without calcium and magnesium (Invitrogen), resuspended in HEPES buffer, and incubated in a sonic bath for 1 h with a saturating concentration (15 μg/ml) of ICAM-1/Fc to allow for both dispersion and coating of beads. In order to block nonspecific adhesion, blocked (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to the bead solution (20% by volume) for 30 min with sonication. The density of ICAM-1/Fc on the surface of the beads has been determined previously (30Seo S.M. McIntire L.V. Smith C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1568-C1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to contain ∼25 binding sites/μm2. Beads were added to the samples at 2 × 107 beads/ml (20 beads per neutrophil). To examine specific adhesion via the β2 integrins, neutrophils were mixed with fluorescent beads with ICAM-1/Fc derivatized to their surface. Sample volumes of 250 μl (HEPES buffer, 1.5 mm CaCl2) contained 1 × 106 neutrophils/ml, 2 × 107 beads/ml, LDS-751 (8 ng/ml, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to label neutrophils, and a small magnetic stir bar. Adhesion blocking antibodies and/or 240Q were preincubated for 10 min with the cell suspension without beads. For samples stimulated with IL-8, stimulus was added just after the beads, and the suspension was then placed immediately on the sample injection port of the FACScan flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). Samples were maintained at 37 °C within a mixing chamber with a magnetic motor as described previously (31Tsang Y.T.M. Neelamegham S., Hu, Y. Berg E.L. Burns A.R. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4566-4577PubMed Google Scholar). The magnetic motor coupled with the magnetic stir bar created a shear field (shear stress ∼1.0 dyne/cm2) within the test tube and initiated collisional interactions of relatively brief contact duration (∼25 ms). Neutrophil capture of ICAM-1-coated beads was continuously monitored at low flow. Neutrophils were distinguished by their characteristic forward and right angle light scatter properties and gated in order to exclude unbound beads. Neutrophil-bead adhesion was quantitated by green bead fluorescence on fluorescence histograms. Quantal increases in fluorescence appeared as peaks in the fluorescence histogram corresponding to populations of neutrophils binding increasing numbers of beads (31Tsang Y.T.M. Neelamegham S., Hu, Y. Berg E.L. Burns A.R. Smith C.W. Simon S.I. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4566-4577PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish relative levels of bead capture within the stimulated neutrophil population, neutrophil-bead interactions were quantitated as the average number of beads per neutrophil according to Equation 1, beads/neutrophil=∑i=16i×NBiN+∑j=16NBjEquation 1 where N represents the number of nonadherent neutrophils, and NBi represents the number of neutrophil-bead aggregates bound to between 1 and 6 or more beads. mAb 327C has been reported previously (15Lupher M.L., Jr. Harris E.A. Beals C.R. Sui L. Liddington R.C. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to recognize the active conformation of CD18 associated with LFA-1 function in phorbol ester or T cell receptor cross-link-stimulated primary human lymphocytes. To determine the kinetics of CD18 activation, neutrophils and PBMC were mixed with 327C-Alexa and examined for 10 min with the flow cytometer under conditions of stimulation by soluble ICAM-1/Fc (150 μg/ml), 240Q, or IL-8 using identical stimulation protocols as the bead adhesion assay. Additional experiments examining the transience of active CD18 expression after IL-8 stimulation were conducted where 327C-Alexa was added to unfixed samples at indicated times after stimulation by 1 nm IL-8. All samples were washed, resuspended, and analyzed on the FACScan flow cytometer. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined for the neutrophil population at indicated time points. Receptor expression in terms of sites/cell was determined by comparing the MFI of bound 327C to Quantum Simply Cellular beads (FCSC, San Juan, Puerto Rico) which contain five bead sets with increasing numbers of goat anti-mouse-binding sites on their surface. From this analysis, a linear relation between MFI and receptor expression was determined for each directly conjugated antibody bound to cells and the calibration bead set. To observe colocalization of either LFA-1 or Mac-1 with 327C, neutrophils (1 × 106/ml) were stimulated with IL-8 or 240Q and incubated at room temperature for 2 min with biotinylated 327C (10 μg/ml) and either anti-LFA-1-PE or anti-Mac-1 (2LPM19c-RPE) according to manufacturer's suggested staining procedure. Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and excess antibody was removed by centrifugation. Following this wash, cells were incubated with neutravidin-FITC for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were centrifuged following staining and resuspended in ice-cold HEPES buffer with 0.1% HSA followed by fixation with an equal volume of freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%. To determine the expression of active CD18 as a function of the time after IL-8 stimulation, neutrophils (1 × 106/ml) were stimulated at time 0 with 1 nmIL-8. Biotinylated 327C (10 μg/ml) was added 2 min prior to each time point. At indicated times, 105 cells were removed and immediately fixed in HEPES buffer containing 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% HSA. Following fixation, neutrophils were incubated with neutravidin-FITC for 20 min at room temperature, washed, and resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde. The labeled cells were imaged using a Nikon TE200 inverted microscope employing an oil immersion 60× Plan-Apo objective and bandpass filters appropriate for FITC or PE labels. Neutrophil intercellular calcium flux was measured using Fluo-3-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Neutrophils (2 × 106 cells) were added to a 1 μm Fluo-3-AM solution in HEPES buffer with 0.1% Me2SO with no calcium or HSA and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in the dark to allow for dye loading. Neutrophils were washed and resuspended in indicator-free HEPES with calcium and HSA and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Neutrophils stimulated with 240Q or R15.7 were allowed to incubate with the noted concentrations of mAb for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Samples were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, maintained at 37 °C with a water jacket, and read on the FACScan flow cytometer. After ∼1 min of reading, the sample tube was removed from the FACScan; stimulant was added at the indicated concentrations (IL-8, 240Q, R15.7, or no additional stimulation), and the sample tube was replaced on the sample injection port of the FACScan and read for an additional ∼3 min. The activated neutrophil population was gated according to the increase in Fluo-3 fluorescence (FL-1) due to intracellular calcium flux that corresponded to two standard deviations above unstimulated neutrophils. Data were independently collected for each experiment, and a mean and S.E. were calculated fo"
https://openalex.org/W2073989193,"Savignygrin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor that possesses the RGD integrin recognition motif, has been purified from the soft tick Ornithodoros savignyi. Two isoforms with similar biological activities differ because of R52G and N60G in their amino acid sequences, indicating a recent gene duplication event. Platelet aggregation induced by ADP (IC50, 130 nm), collagen, the thrombin receptor-activating peptide, and epinephrine was inhibited, although platelets were activated and underwent a shape change. The binding of α-CD41 (P2) to platelets, the binding of purified αIIbβ3 to fibrinogen, and the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen was inhibited, indicating a targeting of the fibrinogen receptor. In contrast, the adhesion of osteosarcoma cells that express the integrin αvβ3 to vitronectin or fibrinogen was not inhibited, indicating the specificity of savignygrin toward αIIbβ3. Savignygrin shows sequence identity to disagregin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor from the tickOrnithodoros moubata that lacks an RGD motif. The cysteine arrangement of savignygrin is similar to that of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor family of serine protease inhibitors. A homology model based on the structure of the tick anticoagulant peptide indicates that the RGD motif is presented on the substrate-binding loop of the canonical BPTI inhibitors. However, savignygrin did not inhibit the serine proteases fXa, plasmin, thrombin, or trypsin.

This is the first report of a platelet aggregation inhibitor that presents the RGD motif using the Kunitz-BPTI protein fold. coagulation factor Xa tick anticoagulant peptide bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor dithiothreitol thrombin receptor-activating peptide fluorescein isothiocyanate size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry untranslated region rapid amplification of cDNA ends root mean square deviation Integrins are a family of adhesion receptors that propitiates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Numerous physiological processes like hemostasis, fertilization, neuron-neuron interaction, and inflammation are mediated by integrins (1Clemetson K.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 499-501Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The functional receptor is expressed as a transmembrane heterodimer consisting of α and β subunits. To date, 17 α and 8 β subunits have been identified and form, in various permutations, more than 20 described integrins (2Plow E.F Cierniewski C.S. Xiao Z. Haas T.A. Byzova T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Different combinations of subunits convey specificity for ligands (collagen-α2β1, fibronectin-α5β1, laminin-α6β1, vitronectin-αvβ3, and fibrinogen-αIIbβ3), although αIIbβ3 can also recognize fibronectin, vitronectin, von Willebrand's factor, and prothrombin (2Plow E.F Cierniewski C.S. Xiao Z. Haas T.A. Byzova T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Most ligands recognized by integrins contain the integrin recognition motif RGD (3Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3841) Google Scholar). Some ligands may also contain other sequences recognized by integrins such as the dodecapeptide sequence HHLGGAKQAGDV from the γ-chain of fibrinogen that binds to αIIbβ3 (4Andrieux A. Hudry-Clergeon G. Ryckewaert J.J. Chapel A. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9258-9265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).αIIbβ3 (GPIIbIIIa) is the major integrin of platelets and the only adhesion receptor capable of mediating platelet aggregation by the binding of fibrinogen or von Willebrand's factor (5Calvete J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 346-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Plow E.F. Cierniewski C.S. Xiao Z. Haas T.A. Byzova T.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On resting platelets, αIIbβ3 exists in an inactive conformation that binds irreversibly to the γ-chain C-terminal dodecapeptide (HHLGGAKQAGDV) of immobilized fibrinogen (5Calvete J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The unactivated form also has a ligand-binding site accessible to small molecules that contain RGD, KGD, RYD, or OrnGD motifs, which are presented on mobile recognition loops protruding 14–17 Å from the protein core (6Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 346-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding site can also be reached by RGD peptides, which extend 11–32 Å from the surface of polyacrylonitrile beads (8Beer J.H. Springer K.T. Coller B.S. Blood. 1992; 79: 117-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the binding pocket in unactivated αIIbβ3 may resemble a narrow cavity buried 10–20 Å below the protein surface (6Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 346-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Upon platelet activation by various agonists, αIIbβ3 undergoes a conformational change that allows the binding of macromolecules that contain the RGD motif. The ligand-binding site is discontinuous and is formed by both αIIb and β3 subunits. A receptor-bound divalent cation within the ligand-binding site interacts with aspartic acid-containing ligands, as found in the RGD motif (2Plow E.F Cierniewski C.S. Xiao Z. Haas T.A. Byzova T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar,5Calvete J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Inhibitors specific for integrins have great potential for the study of integrin function and the development of pharmaceutical compounds (7Plow E.F. Cierniewski C.S. Xiao Z. Haas T.A. Byzova T.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The most extensively characterized natural inhibitors are the snake venom disintegrins that are involved in the maintenance of hemorrhage by the inhibition of platelet aggregation (9Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A. Huang T.F. Holt J.C. Cook J.J. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Platelet aggregation is compromised by the inhibition of fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3, which mediates platelet-platelet interaction. Disintegrins are a family of low molecular mass (5,400–9,000 Da) proteins that contains the RGD motif except for barbourin, which contains the sequence KGD (10Huang T.F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Most disintegrins inhibit platelet aggregation with IC50 values 3,000–30,000× lower (nanomolar concentration range) than the tetrapeptide RGDS (micromolar range) because of the conformation-restricted presentation of the RGD motif (11Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Hsu M.A. Phillips D.R. Fried V.A. Campbell A.M. Nannizzi L. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9359-9362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of the snake venom disintegrins echistatin, kistrin, flavoridin, dendroaspin, and the leech-derived decorsin have been elucidated in solution with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques (12Saudek V. Atkinson R.A. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7369-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Adler M. Lazarus R.A. Dennis M.S. Wagner G.

Science. 1994; 264: 1944-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Disintegrins do not possess a classical secondary structure but rather a dense core consisting of β-turns kept intact by disulfide bonds with a protruding loop region that presents the RGD motif. The sequences flanking the RGD motif as well as the spatial configuration of the RGD motif at the end of the loop have been found to be important contributors to specificity for different integrins (17Scarborough R.M. Rose J.W. Naughton M.A. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Inhibitors unrelated to the disintegrin family but proposed to bind to αIIbβ3 have been described for both hard and soft ticks (18Wang X. Coons L.B. Taylor D.B. Stevens S.E. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17785-17790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Karczewski J. Endris R. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6702-6708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitor variabilin, from the hard tickDermacentor variabilis, contains a RGD motif that is not flanked by cysteine residues, making it unique in this respect (18Wang X. Coons L.B. Taylor D.B. Stevens S.E. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17785-17790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Disagregin from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata contains no RGD sequence, and it was found that the γ-fibrinogen sequence HHLGGALQAGDV competes with its binding to soluble αIIbβ3. This indicates an inhibition mechanism distinct from disintegrins (19Karczewski J. Endris R. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6702-6708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Karczewski J. Connolly T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the coagulation cascade serine proteases of the host have also been described for soft ticks. These include fXa1 (TAP and fXaI) and thrombin (ornithodorin and savignin) inhibitors (21Nienaber J. Gaspar A.R.M.D. Neitz A.W.H. Exp.

All possess the Kunitz bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) fold, although the mechanisms of inhibition differ from those of the canonical BPTI-like inhibitors. Whereas canonical BPTI-inhibitors present a substrate-binding loop to the active site of their respective enzymes, the tick inhibitors insert their N-terminal sequences into the active site (21Nienaber J.

Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). This study describes the platelet aggregation inhibitor savignygrin, from the soft tick Ornithodoros savignyi, that presents its RGD motif on the substrate-binding presenting loop of the canonical BPTI inhibitors. The presence of the RGD motif in the BPTI fold presents a new protein fold that can be manipulated for investigations into integrin structure/function relationships.DISCUSSIONControl of the hemostatic system of the host is essential for successful tick feeding. Efficient inhibitors of the hemostatic system are thus an important part of the feeding strategy of ticks (22Law J.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 64: 87-111Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Soft ticks are a rich source of inhibitors of both blood coagulation and platelet aggregation. Inhibitors of the blood clotting cascade serine proteases fXa and thrombin have been characterized (21Nienaber J. Gaspar A.R.M.D. Neitz A.W.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1999; 93: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Law J.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 64: 87-111Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 23Waxman L.

Apyrase, which inhibits platelet aggregation by the hydrolysis of ADP, has also been investigated (29Mans B.J. Louw A.I. Gaspar A.R.M.D. Neitz A.W.H. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 1998; 22: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Mans B.J. Coetzee J. Louw A.I. Gaspar A.R.M.D. Neitz A.W.H. Exp. Appl.

Collagen-specific platelet aggregation inhibitors and αIIbβ3 agonists have been described (19Karczewski J. Endris R. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6702-6708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Karczewski J. Connolly T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 55Waxman L. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5445-5449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Karczewski J. Waxman L. Endris R.G. Connolly T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This study describes savignygrin, a potent platelet aggregation inhibitor, that is thought to inhibit platelets by targeting the platelet integrin αIIbβ3. This is the first described platelet aggregation inhibitor from soft ticks with an RGD integrin recognition motif that is presented on the canonical substrate-binding presenting loop of the Kunitz-BPTI fold.The different isoforms from O. savignyi were detected in 20 individual ticks analyzed, which indicate that the (+/−) forms are gene duplicates and not allelic variants (results not shown). Interestingly, no isoforms were observed for disagregin, and no difference could be observed in the electrophoretic mobilities under reduced and non-reduced conditions (19Karczewski J. Endris R. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6702-6708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the (+/−) gene duplication is a fairly recent event that occurred after the divergence of these two tick species from a common ancestor. The presence of the A/B conformational isoforms is more problematic, as no sequences were obtained that could explain the differences. However, it is not uncommon to find separation of a single protein into two peaks during RPHPLC. Such 2-peak separations are generally observed for proteins that are stable under reversed-phase chromatography conditions (low pH and high concentrations of organic mobile phase) so that native as well as unfolded forms are present (57Kunitani M. Johnson D. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 371: 313-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Biological activity is not affected by sequence or conformation differences as indicated by similar IC50 values (∼130 nm) for all four isoforms. This could be accounted for in part by the RGD motif that is present in all four isoforms. Platelets are activated by various agonists via specific receptors and distinct pathways culminating in the activation of αIIbβ3, which mediates aggregation through the binding of fibrinogen (6Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 346-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Platelet activation is accompanied by a shape change from a discoid (resting) to a spherical form (activated), the extension of pseudopods, and the aggregation-independent release of platelet granules (58Cattaneo M. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Lecchi A. Bevilacqua C. Packham M.A. Mustard J.F. Blood. 1987; 70: 221-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of platelets preincubated with savignygrin was indicated by a decrease in transmittance during the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by various agonists. Electron microscopic analysis of platelets incubated with savignygrin before activation with ADP confirmed the discoid to spherical shape change associated with activation (59Zucker M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 117-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This suggests postactivation inhibition by the savignygrins and implicates the common denominator of platelet aggregation, the integrin αIIbβ3. The inhibition of the binding of α-CD41-FITC in the presence or absence of ADP strongly suggests that savignygrins bind to resting as well as to activated αIIbβ3. The targeting of αIIbβ3 was further supported by the inhibition of αIIbβ3 binding to fibrinogen. The discrimination observed for savignygrin between αvβ3 and αIIbβ3was also found for disagregin (19Karczewski J. Endris R. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6702-6708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could indicate that BPTI-like inhibitors of platelet aggregation are integrin specific. The BPTI fold might thus be useful to design integrin-specific antagonists.It was shown that disagregin inhibits the binding of echistatin (which contains the RGD motif) to platelets, suggesting an interaction with the RGD-binding site (19Karczewski J. Endris R. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6702-6708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is strongly supported by the presence of an RGD motif in the sequence of savignygrin. Although disagregin has a RED motif, and peptide studies showed that the peptide REDV does not inhibit platelet aggregation, a restricted conformation induced by the three-dimensional structure of disagregin could account for inhibitory activity (60Chen C.S. Papayannopoulos I.A. Timmons S. Chou S.H. Thiagarajan P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1075: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This is supported by the dependence of savignygrin on intact disulfide bonds for the maintenance of an active but restricted biological conformation. BPTI has also been shown to occur as a very disordered polymer in its reduced form, even in the absence of denaturants (61Creighton T.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1978; 33: 231-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The sequence adjacent to the RGD motif of savignygrin (YGCRGDEDA) is similar to that of disagregin (YGCREDDDS), which suggests that the sequence around the RGD motif could have an important effect on its function. Of particular interest is the fact that two downstream residues are negatively charged. It is possible that these residues interact with the receptor-bound cation localized inside the αIIbβ3 ligand-binding site (2Plow E.F Cierniewski C.S. Xiao Z. Haas T.A. Byzova T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 6Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1995; 208: 346-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was also shown that disagregin can inhibit the binding of the dodecapeptide sequence of γ-fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 (20Karczewski J. Connolly T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There might thus be other binding sites for αIIbβ3 apart from the RGD motif in the savignygrins.Secondary structure elements are normally conserved in proteins with the same structural folds. This is exemplified by the conserved areas observed for the predicted β-sheet and α-helix elements in the alignment of disagregin and savignygrin. Of interest is the fact that the region surrounding the RGD/RED motif is the largest conserved stretch between disagregin and savignygrin. However, no consensus secondary structure is predicted in this region. As residues are normally conserved either for structural or functional purposes, this suggests that this region is important for activity. The surface models corroborate this view, as the RGDED forms a continuous binding epitope.The BPTI fold is generally associated with serine protease inhibitors (28Laskowski M., Jr. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). This study indicated that the savignygrins do not inhibit serine proteases. This fits with the specialization of the substrate-binding presenting loop of the savignygrins to target the platelet fibrinogen receptor. Other BPTI-like proteins that do not inhibit serine proteases include a rather large group of toxins found in snake venom, which function by targeting the ion channels of the cardiac and nervous systems (62Pritchard L. Dufton M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).To have any biological significance during tick feeding, bioactive components need to be secreted (22Law J.H. Ribeiro J.M.C. Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 64: 87-111Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Secretory proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum via a hydrophobic signal peptide in their N terminus from where they are transported to the Golgi network and finally secreted by either constitutive or regulated secretion in secretory granules. Extracellular proteins in general are disulfide rich, and disulfide bonds are absent in intracellular proteins because of the reducing environment in the cytoplasm (63Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 64von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 65Fahey R.C. Hunt J.S. Windham G.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1977; 10: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The presence of a signal peptide in the full-length sequences of savignygrin and the fact that all cysteines are involved in disulfide bonds indicate that the savignygrins are targeted to the secretory pathway. No evidence suggesting secretion has yet been described for variabilin or disagregin (18Wang X. Coons L.B. Taylor D.B. Stevens S.E. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17785-17790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Karczewski J. Endris R. Connolly T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6702-6708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Variabilin, a 40 amino acid platelet aggregation inhibitor from the hard tick D. variabilis contains a RGD motif in the last third of its sequence (18Wang X. Coons L.B. Taylor D.B. Stevens S.E. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17785-17790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There is no amino acid sequence similarity between variabilin and savignygrin, and the position of the RGD motif is completely different. This suggests that platelet aggregation inhibitors with RGD-like motifs have evolved after the divergence of hard and soft ticks. This implies that the main tick families have adapted to their blood feeding environments independently.New strategies to investigate integrin-ligand interaction are essential to gain a comprehensive view of αIIbβ3antagonism. This would be useful in the design of a new generation of antithrombotic therapies (7Plow E.F. Cierniewski C.S. Xiao Z. Haas T.A. Byzova T.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Savignygrin and related BPTI-like inhibitors present a new protein fold that can be used in integrin-ligand investigations. The presentation of RGD on the BPTI fold could be useful to engineer novel scaffolds that exhibit both blood coagulation and platelet aggregation inhibitory capabilities. Integrins are a family of adhesion receptors that propitiates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Numerous physiological processes like hemostasis, fertilization, neuron-neuron interaction, and inflammation are mediated by integrins (1Clemetson K.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 499-501Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The functional receptor is expressed as a transmembrane heterodimer consisting of α and β subunits. To date, 17 α and 8 β subunits have been identified and form, in various permutations, more than 20 described integrins (2Plow E.F Cierniewski C.S. Xiao Z. Haas T.A. Byzova T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Different combinations of subunits convey specificity for ligands (collagen-α2β1, fibronectin-α5β1, laminin-α6β1, vitronectin-αvβ3, and fibrinogen-αIIbβ3), although αIIbβ3 can also recognize fibronectin, vitronectin, von Willebrand's factor, and prothrombin (2Plow E.F Cierniewski C.S.

https://openalex.org/W2078325520,"Recent fossil finds and experimental analysis of chick and mouse embryos highlighted the lateral fin fold theory, which suggests that two pairs of limbs in tetrapods evolved by subdivision of an elongated single fin. Here we examine fin development in embryos of the primitive cartilaginous fish, Scyliorhinus canicula (dogfish) using scanning electron microscopy and investigate expression of genes known to be involved in limb positioning, identity and patterning in higher vertebrates. Although we did not detect lateral fin folds in dogfish embryos, Engrailed-1 expression suggests that the body is compartmentalized dorso-ventrally. Furthermore, specification of limb identity occurs through the Tbx4 and Tbx5 genes, as in higher vertebrates. In contrast, unlike higher vertebrates, we did not detect Shh transcripts in dogfish fin-buds, although dHand (a gene involved in establishing Shh) is expressed. In S. canicula, the main fin axis seems to lie parallel to the body axis. 'Freeing' fins from the body axis and establishing a separate 'limb' axis has been proposed to be a crucial step in evolution of tetrapod limbs. We suggest that Shh plays a critical role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1995032342,"The lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B is thought to play a central role in intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation and the onset of experimental pancreatitis. Recent in vitro studies have suggested that this mechanism might be of pathophysiological relevance in hereditary pancreatitis, a human inborn disorder associated with mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene. In the present study evidence is presented that cathepsin B is abundantly present in the secretory compartment of the human exocrine pancreas, as judged by immunogold electron microscopy. Moreover, pro-cathepsin B and mature cathepsin B are both secreted together with trypsinogen and active trypsin into the pancreatic juice of patients with sporadic pancreatitis or hereditary pancreatitis. Finally, cathepsin B- catalyzed activation of recombinant human cationic trypsinogen with hereditary pancreatitis-associated mutations N29I, N29T, or R122H were characterized. In contrast to a previous report, cathepsin B-mediated activation of wild type and all three mutant trypsinogen forms was essentially identical under a wide range of experimental conditions. These observations confirm the presence of active cathepsin B in the human pancreatic secretory pathway and are consistent with the notion that cathepsin B-mediated trypsinogen activation might play a pathogenic role in human pancreatitis. On the other hand, the results clearly demonstrate that hereditary pancreatitis-associated mutations do not lead to increased or decreased trypsinogen activation by cathepsin B.

The cellular mechanisms through which these mutations trigger the onset of pancreatitis are still a matter of debate (for review, see Refs. 10Lerch M.M. Gorelick F.S. Med. Clin. N.

Intuitively, the mutations might lead to a gain of trypsin function either by increased intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation or by an extended activity of trypsin due to impaired inactivation. Trypsin would then, in analogy to the conditions in the small intestine, activate other digestive proteases in a cascade-like fashion and, thus, mediate acinar cell injury. Indeed, investigations into the biochemical properties of hereditary pancreatitis-associated trypsinogen mutants unraveled both possible mechanisms, increased autocatalytic activation (autoactivation) of trypsinogen and decreased autocatalytic degradation (autolysis) of trypsin (3Teich N.

Enhanced autoactivation has been shown for several mutations (D22G, K23R, N29I, N29T, R122H), whereas increased trypsin stability was found for the N29T, R122H, and R122C mutations. In contrast, the clinically relevant and rather common N29I mutation has no effect on trypsin autolysis (12Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It is therefore likely that increased trypsin stability is either an accessory pathway that is present in only certain varieties of hereditary pancreatitis or simply a biochemical epiphenomenon. More recent experiments demonstrated that the surface loop containing Arg-122 in cationic trypsinogen is a low affinity inhibitor of trypsin and might play an important role in stabilizing intrapancreatic trypsinogen against autoactivation, particularly at high zymogen concentrations (16Kukor Z. Tóth M. Pál G. Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6111-6117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Loss of this inhibitory activity due to the R122H mutation might also increase autoactivation of trypsinogen and contribute to the development of hereditary pancreatitis associated with this mutation. A number of reports have challenged the gain-of-function hypothesis and suggested that a loss of trypsin function might impair the inactivation of other digestive enzymes (8Simon P. Weiss U.F. Sahin-Tóth M. Perry M. Nayler O. Lenfers B. Schnekenburger J. Mayerle J. Domschke W. Lerch M.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2002; 282: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Support for this idea comes from the observation that recombinant trypsinogen carrying the R122C mutation exhibits reduced activability (8Simon P. Weiss U.F. Sahin-Tóth M. Perry M. Nayler O.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5404-5410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and that experiments in isolated pancreatic acini and lobules have shown that intracellular trypsin activity is neither required nor involved in trypsinogen activation, and its most prominent role is in autodegradation (17Halangk W. Krüger B. Ruthenbürger M. Stürzebecher J. Albrecht E. Lippert H. Lerch M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This, in turn, would suggest that intracellular trypsin activity has a role in the defense against other, potentially more harmful digestive proteases and that structural alterations that impair the function of trypsin would eliminate a protective mechanism rather than generate a triggering event for pancreatitis (10Lerch M.M. Gorelick F.S. Med. Clin. N. Am. 2000; 84: 549-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All investigators, however, agree that a premature and intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen is an early event in the course of pancreatitis and is critically involved in the disease onset (1Whitcomb D.C.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 293-298PubMed Google Scholar) trypsinogen in vitro. Furthermore, several studies employing animal models of the disease (22Saluja A.K. Donovan E.A. Yamanaka K. Yamaguchi Y. Hofbauer B. Steer M.L. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or cathepsin B-deficient strains of mice (23Halangk M.W. Lerch M.M. Brandt-Nedelev B. Roth W. Ruthenbuerger M. Reinheckel T. Domschke W. Lippert H. Peters C. Deussing J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) demonstrate that cathepsin B plays a critical role in intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation and the onset of experimental pancreatitis. Whether these observations have any relevance for the human pancreas or for the onset of pancreatitis associated with trypsinogen mutations is unknown. In this respect, recent experiments with recombinant human cationic trypsinogen demonstrate that cathepsin B activates the N29I mutant almost 3-fold faster than wild-type trypsinogen, indicating that a pathogenic role for cathepsin B in hereditary pancreatitis is a distinct possibility (15Szilágyi L. Kénesi E. Katona G. Kaslik G. Juhász G. Gráf L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24574-24580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several conditions need to be met before such a mechanism could be regarded of pathophysiological relevance. (i) Cathepsin B has to be intracellularly sorted into the secretory pathway, where it can interact with digestive pro-enzymes. This is clearly the case in the rat (24Tooze J. Hollinshead M. Hensel G. Kern H.F. Hoflack B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 187-200PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit (25Hirano T. Saluja A. Ramarao P. Lerch M.M. Saluja M. Steer M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) pancreas, but it is unknown whether it occurs in the human pancreas. (ii) To activate protease zymogens, cathepsin B has to be present in the secretory compartment as mature, active protease. (iii) To play a relevant role in hereditary pancreatitis, cathepsin B has to activate recombinant trypsinogen with hereditary pancreatitis-associated mutations differently from wild-type trypsinogen. Increased susceptibility of trypsinogen mutants to cathepsin B activation would be consistent with the gain-of-function model, whereas decreased activation by cathepsin B would support the loss-of-function hypothesis. In the present study we have addressed all three issues and found that although cathepsin B is clearly sorted into the secretory compartment of the exocrine pancreas and secreted as an active enzyme, cathepsin B-induced trypsinogen activation is not affected by any of the three hereditary pancreatitis-associated trypsinogen mutations (N29I, N29T, R122H) we have investigated. Cathepsin B was purchased from Calbiochem. This commercial preparation was purified from human liver by high performance liquid chromatography (catalog #219362, lot #B28549; 1.136 mg/ml protein concentration, 22 units/mg protein specific activity, in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 1 mm EDTA; purity >95%). Where indicated, experiments were also carried out with recombinant human cathepsin B, expressed in sf9 insect cells, and purified as described previously (26Steed P.M. LaSala D. Liebman J. Wigg A. Clark K. Knap A.K. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2033-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This enzyme preparation exhibited ∼30% lower specific activity for human trypsinogen substrate than commercial cathepsin B purified from human liver. Before use, cathepsin B was activated with 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT,1 final concentration) for 30 min on ice. Benzamidine-HCl and N-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide were from Sigma, bovine enterokinase was from Biozyme Laboratories (San Diego, CA), [CBZ-Ile-Pro-Arg]2-rhodamine 110 and CBZ-Arg-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), reagent grade bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Biocell Laboratories (Rancho Dominguez, CA), E64d (l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-Leu-3-methylbutylamide-ethyl-ester, lot 0542851) was from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany), and AEBSF (pefabloc, lot B36440) was from Calbiochem. For the detection of cathepsin B three different antibodies were used: AB1, polyclonal cathepsin B antibody, which was a kind gift of Drs. H. Kirschke and E. Weber (Halle/Saale, Germany); AB2, polyclonal (catalog #PC41); and AB3, monoclonal (catalog #IM27L) cathepsin B antibodies obtained from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). A monoclonal antibody directed against anionic trypsinogen was generated as previously described (27Krüger B. Knoll M. Gottschall A. Tessenow W. Meyer U. Dummler W. Fresenius' J. Anal. Chem. 1990; 337: 101Google Scholar). Enzymatic deglycosylation kit #170-6500 was purchased from Bio-Rad. Amino acid residues in the human cationic trypsinogen sequence were denoted according to their actual position in the native, wild-type preproenzyme. A comparison of this numbering system to the classic chymotrypsin numbering can be found in (28Chen J.M. Ferec C. Pfützer R.H. Whitcomb D.C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 277-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the subcellular distribution of cathepsin B in relation to digestive enzymes in the exocrine pancreas, human pancreatic tissue and juice were used with informed patient consent and permission of the Ethics Committees of the Universities of Rostock or Münster. Small blocks of pancreas tissue from organ donors after explantation were fixed in iced 1.5% glutaraldehyde solution and embedded in LR-White resin. Thin sections were subsequently double-labeled as previously reported (29Lerch M.M. Lutz M.P. Weidenbach H. Müller-Pillasch F. Gress T.M. Leser J. Adler G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Lerch M.M. Halangk W. Krüger B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 477: 403-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with polyclonal antibody directed against cathepsin B (AB1, final concentration 200 μg/ml) and monoclonal antibody directed against anionic trypsinogen (final concentration, 100 μg/ml). Antigen detection was achieved with specific secondary antibody coupled to immunogold particles of 15 nm for cathepsin B and of 5 nm for trypsinogen. Control sections were incubated with antibody that had been preincubated with an excess of human cathepsin B or trypsin, respectively, for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate for better contrast and viewed on a Phillips EM 10 or EM 109 electron microscope. To determine the relative content of cathepsin B in secretory granules and lysosomes, the surface labeling over cross-sections of 100 randomly selected organelles was evaluated at high magnification, and the absolute number of 15-nm gold particles was quantitated. Both types of organelles were identified by their typical morphological appearance, and the presence of trypsin in secretory granules and its complete absence in primary lysosomes served as an additional characteristic. Only secretory vesicles with a diameter of >1 μm were used for quantitation to ensure sectioning through the approximate center of the organelle and to avoid underestimation of the cathepsin B content. To establish whether cathepsin B and trypsinogen are secreted by the human exocrine pancreas and appear in the secretory compartment of patients with sporadic pancreatitis or hereditary chronic pancreatitis, informed consent was obtained to collect pancreatic juice during endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a clinical imaging procedure during which the main pancreatic duct is selectively cannulated and collection of pure pancreatic juice is feasible. Two of the patients with chronic pancreatitis carried none of the known gene mutations associated with hereditary pancreatitis, whereas two others were both carriers of the R122H mutation. In the aliquots of pure pancreatic juice, spontaneous trypsin activity as well as enterokinase-activated (0.001 units/ml, 60 min, 37 °C) trypsin activity was determined using the specific fluorogenic substrate [CBZ-Ile-Pro-Arg]2-rhodamine 110 in 100 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm substrate (final concentrations), and 0.1 μg of juice protein in a 150-μl final volume at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm at 37 °C. Initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were measured in arbitrary fluorescence units/min, as previously described (31Krüger B. Albrecht E. Lerch M.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 43-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 32Krüger B. Weber I.A. Albrecht E. Mooren F.C. Lerch M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was then compared with the activity of bovine trypsinogen (Calbiochem #6502, lot B27456, 3194 units/mg) activated with enterokinase (0.001 units/ml, 60 min at 37 °C) as standard, and activity was expressed as units/mg juice protein. Cathepsin B activity in pancreatic juice samples was determined in 0.25 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm specific substrate CBZ-Arg-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin (final concentrations), and 1 μg of juice protein in a final volume of 150 μl at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Where indicated, the serine protease inhibitor pefabloc (0.1 mm final concentration) or the cathepsin B inhibitor E64d (10 mm final concentration) were included in the assays. Cleavage of the cathepsin B substrate was measured for 60 min in a microplate fluorescence reader (SPECTRAmax GEMINI, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), compared with the activity of human cathepsin B (Calbiochem, see above) as standard, and expressed in units/mg of juice protein. To demonstrate the presence of pro-cathepsin B in pancreatic juice, the pro-enzyme was activated to mature cathepsin B by incubating with pepsin (1 mg/ml porcine stomach mucosa pepsin,Calbiochem) in 0.1 m sodium formate buffer at pH 3.0 for 1 h, as described previously (Ref. 33Ren W.-P. Fridman R. Zabrecky J.R. Morris L.D. Day N.A. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and references therein). Pancreatic juice samples were diluted with ice-cold buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (1 ml/mg protein, containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.01 m sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mNaF, 1 mml-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor)) and adjusted to the same volume. Pancreatic tissue and liver tissue was homogenized by 10 strokes in lysis buffer containing 0.25 m sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT using a glass Dounce S homogenizer. Samples were subsequently sonicated twice for 10 s at 30% power setting and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were used in subsequent experiments. Samples were boiled for 5 min in 4× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 12% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol) and electrophoresed on 12 or 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15 μg of protein/lane, Bio-Rad, Criterion precast gel), and proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences). After overnight blocking in 0.2% NET-gelatin (1.5 m NaCl, 0.05 m EDTA, 0.5m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% gelatin) immunoblot analysis was performed with a polyclonal anti-cathepsin B antibody (AB1, 1:10,000 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:15,000 dilution) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, a 1:1 mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was preincubated with cathepsin B antibody (AB3) in 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5. Tissue homogenates were added to the pre-coupled antibody and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotor wheel. Precipitates were washed with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described above. Construction of expression plasmids with wild-type and mutant trypsinogen genes (N29I, N29T, R122H) was previously described (12Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Small scale expression and in vitro refolding of trypsinogen was carried out essentially as previously reported (12Sahin-Tóth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22750-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Concentrations of zymogen solutions were measured from their ultraviolet absorbance using a calculated extinction coefficient of 36,160m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. Unless otherwise indicated, the activation peptide sequence of recombinant zymogen preparations used in this study was Met-Ala-Pro-Phe-(Asp)4-Lys. The standard activation mixture (50 μl) contained 2 μmcationic trypsinogen, 2 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm K-EDTA, 300 μm benzamidine, and 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer at the indicated pH (final concentrations). This mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min, and the reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of activated cathepsin B solution. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C, and at the indicated times, 2.5-μl aliquots were removed for trypsin activity assays. Trypsin activity was determined using the synthetic chromogenic substrateN-CBZ-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (200 μm final concentration) at 405 nm in 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm CaCl2, at 22 °C. First, the specificity of the cathepsin B and trypsin antibodies used for the immunological detection of these enzymes was characterized. We compared two polyclonal (AB1 and AB2 in Fig.1A) and one monoclonal (AB3 in Fig. 1A) anti-human cathepsin B antibody preparations in Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments with homogenized human pancreatic or liver tissue (Fig. 1A). All three antibodies detected two specific bands in pancreatic tissue, and the same two bands were immunoprecipitated from pancreatic or liver homogenates. On the basis of their mobility, the 47- and 32-kDa bands were identified as pro-cathepsin B and the single-chain form of mature cathepsin B, respectively. Subjecting the immunoprecipitated material to enzymatic deglycosylation (Bio-Rad) did not alter the mobility of the two bands, indicating that they do not represent differently glycosylated forms of mature cathepsin B (not shown). Furthermore, treatment of pancreatic homogenates with pepsin, which converts pro-cathepsin B to mature cathepsin B (see Ref. 33Ren W.-P. Fridman R. Zabrecky J.R. Morris L.D. Day N.A. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and references therein), resulted in a 1.5–2-fold increase in cathepsin B activity, confirming the presence of inactive pro-cathepsin B (not shown). It is also noteworthy that mobility of the two immunoreactive bands from pancreas or liver homogenates was essentially identical, suggesting that these two tissues contain the same cathepsin B isoforms. The monoclonal antibody against anionic trypsinogen detected a strong band representing anionic trypsinogen and a second weaker band corresponding to anionic trypsin (Fig. 1B) after isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting of purified anionic trypsinogen or pancreatic juice. This monoclonal antibody does not cross-react with any other pancreatic secretory enzyme or cathepsin B and has been previously been characterized in detail (27Krüger B. Knoll M. Gottschall A. Tessenow W. Meyer U. Dummler W. Fresenius' J. Anal. Chem. 1990; 337: 101Google Scholar). As predicted from previous animal studies, cathepsin B was detected by immunogold electron microscopy in acinar cells of the healthy human pancreas (Fig. 2). Control incubations with the AB1 anti-cathepsin B or anti-trypsinogen antibodies that had been preincubated with their respective antigens resulted in hardly any background gold decoration (Fig. 2A). Cathepsin B appeared in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2B) and in primary and secondary lysosomes (inset in Fig. 2B) but was detected neither in the nucleus nor in the cytosol of acinar cells. A prominent and consistent co-localization with trypsinogen was found in secretory vesicles of acinar cells (Fig. 2, B–D), and abundant cathepsin B was also detected in the acinar cell lumen (Fig.2E) or the pancreatic ducts.

Histone modification by acetylation and deacetylation is a critical control of chromatin structure. In this study, we test the hypothesis that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is physically associated with a basic component of the DNA replication machinery as a mechanism of coordinating histone deacetylation and DNA synthesis. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a sliding clamp that serves as a loading platform for many proteins involved in DNA replication and DNA repair. We show that PCNA interacts with HDAC1 in human cells and in vitro and that a considerable fraction of PCNA and HDAC1 colocalize in the cell nucleus. PCNA associates with histone deacetylase activity that is completely abolished in the presence of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. Trichostatin A treatment arrests cells at the G2-M phase of the cell cycle, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the proper formation of the chromatin after DNA replication may be important in signaling the progression through the cell cycle.

Our results strengthen the role of PCNA as a factor coordinating DNA replication and epigenetic inheritance. Epigenetic markings play an essential role in regulating the gene expression program of vertebrate cells. One of the fundamental challenges of cell division is therefore coordinating the processes of genetic and epigenetic inheritance. The cell must possess multiple mechanisms to coordinate these processes (1Szyf M. Detich N. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 47-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, DNA methylation is coordinated with DNA replication (2Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by physical association of maintenance DNA methyltransferase 1 with the DNA replication fork protein PCNA 1The abbreviations used are: PCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenHDAChistone deacetylaseTSAtrichostatin AGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell-sorting (3Chuang L.S.

The specific targeting of nucleosome assembly to the newly synthesized DNA is achieved by direct interaction of histone chaperone CAF-1 with PCNA (5Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). PCNA is a homotrimeric protein that forms a sliding clamp around DNA and functions as a DNA polymerase processivity factor during replication and nucleotide excision repair. Through its multiple protein-protein interactions, PCNA coordinates events in replication, epigenetic inheritance, repair, and cell cycle control (6Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). A recent study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that several mutations in PCNA decrease silencing at telomeres and at the mating-type HMR locus (7Zhang Z. Shibahara K. Stillman B. Nature. 2000; 408: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the Drosophila PCNA gene mus209 suppress repression in the vicinity of heterochromatin (8Henderson D.S. Banga S.S. Grigliatti T.A. Boyd J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The disruption of epigenetic silencing has been attributed to the inability of some of these mutants to associate with CAF-1. However, synergism of several PCNA mutants with CAF-1 mutants suggested that PCNA may participate in silencing through another factor. During nucleosome assembly, histones H3 and H4 undergo transient acetylation before their deposition onto replicated DNA. In the process of chromatin maturation, newly deposited acetylated histones are generally deacetylated by a mechanism that is poorly understood (9Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether HDAC1 could be involved in this process. HDAC1 is a member of a growing family of proteins that currently consists of 16 isoforms divided into three classes (10Fischer D.D. Cai R. Bhatia U. Asselbergs F.A. Song C. Terry R. Trogani N. Widmer R. Atadja P. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6656-6666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HDACs have been found in multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle, differentiation, and DNA repair. HDAC1 and HDAC2 have been shown to associate with the NuRD nucleosome remodeling complex (11Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) as well as with the mammalian transcription repressor Sin3 and to be targeted to promoter elements to cause transcriptional repression (12Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Recruitment of HDAC1 by retinoblastoma protein (Rb) to E2F1-responsive promoters supports its role in cell cycle regulation (13Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 14Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S., Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In addition, HDAC1 and HDAC2 have been shown to associate with DNA methyltransferase 1 and play a role in transcriptional silencing (15Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 16Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), thereby establishing a link between two major epigenetic modifications: DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. Similar to DNA replication, DNA repair machinery utilizes chromatin remodeling activities to make the DNA more accessible and to reestablish the proper chromatin structure after DNA repair. In accordance, Hus1 and Rad9, two human checkpoint proteins, were shown to form a complex with HDAC1 (17Cai R.L. Yan-Neale Y. Cueto M.A., Xu, H. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27909-27916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, another histone-modifying enzyme, histone acetyltransferase p300, has been shown to form a complex with PCNA and was proposed to play a role in DNA repair after UV-induced DNA damage (18Hasan S. Hassa P.O. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. Nature. 2001; 410: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that similar to DNA methyltransferase 1 and CAF-1, HDAC1 associates with PCNA, which may serve as a recruiting factor for histone deacetylases to the sites of DNA replication and repair. We also tested the hypothesis that disruption of HDAC activity would disrupt cell cycle progression. A549 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (ATCC CCL 185) were grown in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. HEK293 human adenovirus type 5-transformed human embryonal kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. MRHF male human foreskin fibroblasts (72-213A; BioWhittaker) were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. For transient transfections, HEK293 cells were plated 18 h before transfection at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish. 6 μg of pcDNA3-HDAC1-F plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. T. Kouzarides) (15Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) were transfected using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. GST-HDAC1 fusion constructs were a kind gift from Dr. T. Kouzarides (15Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli XA90, induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, and purified following the protocol from Amersham Biosciences, with modifications. To isolate fusion proteins from inclusion bodies, the bacterial pellet was lysed in STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) on ice, lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and incubation was continued for an additional 15 min on ice. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 2%, and the samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm. The supernatants were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the concentrations of the different fusion proteins were estimated by subjecting small portions of the samples to SDS-PAGE. Equal amounts of the fusion proteins were used in the binding assays, whereas glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the binding mixtures to achieve equal amount of beads in the binding reactions. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated in radioimmune precipitation buffer (9.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) with 2 mg of total cell extracts prepared from either A549 or HEK293 cells and pre-cleared with beads alone. The binding reaction was incubated by rocking overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. PCNA was transcribed/translated in vitro using the coupled transcription translation system (Promega) from pHPCNA15 vector (a kind gift from Dr. Edward K. L. Chan) (19Huff J.P. Roos G. Peebles C.L. Houghten R. Sullivan K.F. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We performed pull-down assays with in vitro translated PCNA as described previously (15Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), adding Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in all buffers. Total cell extract was prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunoprecipitations, 2 mg of cell extract were incubated with 10 μl of agarose-conjugated PCNA antibody (PC10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or agarose-conjugated mouse IgG by rocking overnight at 4 °C. Bound complexes were washed four times with 1 ml of PBS (9.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmNaH2PO4, and 150 mm NaCl) and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocking the nonspecific binding with 5% milk, HDAC1, PCNA, and FLAG-tagged proteins were detected using a 1:1000 dilution of HDAC1 antibody (H-51; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a 1:1000 dilution of PCNA antibody (PC-10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a 1:5000 dilution of FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma), respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (A0545; Sigma) and anti-mouse IgG (115035-146; Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at dilutions of 1:5000 and 1:20,000, respectively, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). 1 mg of HEK293 total cell extract was incubated with 10 μl of agarose-conjugated PCNA antibody or agarose-conjugated normal mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of PBS and assayed for deacetylase activity using the HDAC Fluorescent Activity Assay/Drug Discovery Kit (AK-500; BIOMOL Research Laboratories). In short, beads were incubated with 100 μm acetylated substrate in 100 μl of assay buffer containing or lacking 1 μm trichostatin A. Incubation of the reaction at 37 °C for 30 min allowed deacetylation of the substrate, which sensitized it to treatment with the developer and produced a fluorophore detectable on a fluorometric reader (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm). A549 cells were plated on coverslips and grown to 60–70% confluence. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature for 20 min, followed by fixation in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and stained for PCNA, followed by staining for HDAC1. All of the staining steps contained PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100. For PCNA staining, coverslips were blocked with 10% donkey serum for 20 min, incubated with a 1:100 dilution of anti-PCNA antibody (PC-10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 5% serum for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rhodamine Red-X anti-mouse IgG (715-295-150; Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 5% serum for 45 min at room temperature, and washed three times. The coverslips were blocked again with 10% goat serum for 20 min, incubated with a 1:50 dilution of anti-HDAC1 antibody (H-51; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1.5% serum for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, incubated with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2012; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1.5% serum for 45 min at room temperature, and washed three times. The coverslips were mounted onto slides using Immu-mount (Shandon). The staining was analyzed using LSM 510 Laser Scanning Microscopy, version 2.5 (Zeiss). The fields were taken with a magnification of ×63. The inserts were zoomed three additional times. A549 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/100-mm plate. The next day, cells were treated with 1 μm trichostatin A (Sigma) for 6, 12, and 24 h. Control cells and treated cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. The fixed cells were stained for DNA with a 50 μg/ml solution of propidium iodide in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were analyzed for DNA content by FACS. To test the hypothesis that PCNA and HDAC1 are physically associated in human cells, we first tested whether they reside in the same multiprotein complex by coimmunoprecipitation assays. Endogenous HDAC1 protein was coimmunoprecipitated by agarose-conjugated anti-PCNA antibody from two human cancer cell lines (A549 and HEK293) as well as from a non-transformed human fibroblast cell line (MRHF), suggesting that the interaction is not unique to the cancer cells (Fig. 1A). Control immunoprecipitation with an equal amount of agarose-conjugated normal mouse IgG failed to precipitate any HDAC1 (Fig. 1A). To further confirm this interaction, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged HDAC1 (HDAC1-F). Anti-PCNA antibody, but not the control mouse IgG, coimmunoprecipitated HDAC1-F (Fig. 1B). To map the interaction domain of HDAC1, we expressed in bacteria and purified three different fragments of HDAC1 fused to GST (Fig. 2A). We used these fusion proteins to carry out GST pull-down assays from total extracts of A549 and HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Western blot analysis using anti-PCNA antibody revealed that two of the GST fusion proteins (region 1 (amino acids 1–120) and region 2 (amino acids 150–242)), which span the catalytic domain of HDAC1, associate with endogenous PCNA. These regions were previously shown to interact with human Hus1 protein (17Cai R.L. Yan-Neale Y. Cueto M.A., Xu, H. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27909-27916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was proposed that Hus1, Rad1, and Rad9, three checkpoint Rad proteins, form a PCNA-like ring structure around the DNA during repair. In addition, region 2 of HDAC1 has been shown to bind DNA methyltransferase 1 and play a role in transcriptional repression (15Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). To test whether the interaction of PCNA and HDAC1 is direct, we translated PCNA in vitro and carried out GST pull-down assays with purified GST-HDAC1 fusion proteins (Fig. 2D). These experiments confirmed that PCNA interacts directly with region 1 and region 2 of HDAC1 but does not interact with GST alone or with region 3 (amino acids 332–482), which contains a L XC XE-like motif previously shown to interact with Rb (14Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S., Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). To confirm the association of PCNA and HDAC1 in vivo, we carried out colocalization studies in A549 cells (Fig. 3). We stained endogenous PCNA protein with anti-PCNA antibody, followed by a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (red). The same slides were subsequently stained for endogenous HDAC1 protein with anti-HDAC1 antibody, followed by a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (green). Both proteins showed strong nuclear staining, and the merging of confocal images appeared mainly yellow, indicating that PCNA and HDAC1 colocalize in vivo. To test whether PCNA associates with an active histone deacetylase, we immunoprecipitated endogenous PCNA from HEK293 cells using anti-PCNA or a control mouse IgG antibody (Fig. 4). The precipitated complexes were tested for their ability to deacetylate an acetylated histone substrate. We showed that PCNA associates with deacetylase activity and that this activity is completely abolished when the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA; 1 μm,final concentration) is included in the deacetylation reaction, suggesting that the histone deacetylase activity associated with PCNA is completely sensitive to TSA. Because the histone deacetylase activity associated with PCNA is sensitive to TSA, we used TSA to study the functional consequences of inhibition of this activity for the progression of the cell cycle. We treated A549 cells with 1 μm trichostatin A. We followed the cell cycle profile by FACS analysis of control cells and cells treated with TSA for 6, 12, and 24 h (Fig. 5). The normal cell cycle distribution was altered early, after only 6 h, causing the accumulation of cells in G2-M phase. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the maturation of chromatin through deacetylation may be involved in the timing of the events that drive the cells from replication to cell division. Efficient assembly of nucleosomes onto newly synthesized DNA is essential for maintaining proper genome function. Chromatin organization is influenced by variations introduced at the nucleosomal level (20Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). One such variation is the deacetylation of newly assembled nucleosomes, a modification involved in the formation of heterochromatin. The pattern of this modification has to be faithfully inherited during cell division. Studies in yeast (21Ekwall K. Olsson T. Turner B.M. Cranston G. Allshire R.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 1021-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22Grewal S.I. Bonaduce M.J. Klar A.J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 563-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (23Taddei A. Maison C. Roche D. Almouzni G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) show that inhibition of deacetylation leads to severe defects in chromosome stability. However, the mechanism of histone deacetylation after DNA replication remains poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that PCNA associates with histone deacetylase 1. Because PCNA is a resident of the DNA replication fork and plays important roles in recruiting proteins to the fork, this physical linkage between PCNA and HDAC1 can explain the deacetylation of histones immediately after DNA replication. We first show that HDAC1 and PCNA coimmunoprecipitate in two cancer cell lines (A549 and HEK293) as well as in a non-transformed cell line (MRHF) (Fig. 1). This indicates that this interaction is universal and is not confined to the cancer cells that might form aberrant complexes. Second, we utilized GST-HDAC1 fusion proteins expressed and purified from bacteria to pull down PCNA from A549 and HEK cells and show that regions 1 and 2, which span the catalytic domain of the HDAC1, both associate with PCNA (Fig. 2, B and C). These regions have previously been shown to interact with the human Hus1 protein involved in DNA repair (17Cai R.L. Yan-Neale Y. Cueto M.A., Xu, H. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27909-27916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Hus1, Rad1, and Rad9, three checkpoint Rad proteins, form a PCNA-like ring structure around the DNA during repair. Therefore, it is likely that this region of HDAC1 recognizes a ring-like structure around DNA and is thus recruited to sites of DNA replication and repair. Third, region 2 of HDAC1 was shown to bind DNA methyltransferase 1 (15Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), which in turn was shown to bind PCNA (3Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), which raised the possibility that the interaction between HDAC1 and PCNA is indirect, through DNA methyltransferase 1. To exclude this possibility, we studied the interactions between purified GST-HDAC1 and in vitro-translated PCNA. The same two regions that interact with PCNA in nuclear extracts also interact with in vitro-translated PCNA (Fig. 2D), indicating that the interaction between PCNA and HDAC1 is direct and is not mediated by DNA methyltransferase 1. Fourth, to further confirm the association of HDAC1 and PCNA in living cells, we carried out colocalization studies. Double staining of A549 cells with antibodies against endogenous PCNA and HDAC1 indicated that both proteins localize to the nucleus. The merging of images obtained by confocal microscopy showed that the two proteins colocalize in vivo (Fig. 3). Fifth, we demonstrate that PCNA recruits a functional histone deacetylase activity that is inhibited by TSA (Fig. 4). However, because HDAC1 is a member of a large family of histone deacetylases, we do not exclude the possibility that other members of the family also bind to PCNA and contribute to the deacetylase activity in the replication fork. Sixth, to test whether deacetylase activity was necessary for the progression of the replication fork during DNA synthesis, we treated A549 cells with TSA and followed their cell cycle by FACS analysis (Fig. 5). If histone deacetylase activity or the presence of HDAC1 was essential for DNA replication per se or for the progress of the replication fork, then the replication fork should have stalled during the S phase of the cell cycle or at the G1-S boundary after TSA inhibition of HDAC1. In contrast to these predictions, we observed that the cells started to accumulate at the G2-M phase 6 h after TSA treatment (Fig. 5). Whereas we cannot formally exclude the possibility that TSA has other effects that might have caused G2-M arrest, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that histone deacetylase activity is essential for the formation of proper chromatin structure after the synthesis of DNA. A recent study has shown that after DNA replication, PCNA remains associated with DNA and serves as an imprinting factor for the chromatin assembly (5Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). This provides a window of opportunity for PCNA to load HDAC1 and allow it to modulate chromatin, leading to its maturation. Why do cells arrest at G2-M after TSA treatment? It is possible that the disorganized hyperacetylated chromatin interferes either directly with the exit from G2 or indirectly by failing to signal proper progression through the cell cycle to a putative G2-M checkpoint. The G2-M arrest might be induced by a cellular checkpoint that monitors the state of acetylation of the chromatin and guarantees that only cells bearing proper chromatin divide. Such a mechanism might have evolved to guarantee the integrity of the epigenome. This checkpoint might be triggered by the induction of specific genes that are especially sensitive to hyperacetylation of histones and induce G2-M cell arrest. Additional experiments are required to address these questions and define the mechanisms through which the cell coordinates the inheritance of the histone acetylation pattern with cell cycle checkpoints. In summary, our data are consistent with a role for PCNA as a coordinator of DNA synthesis, epigenetic inheritance, and cell cycle control. The interaction of PCNA with HDAC1 as well as with DNA methyltransferase 1 and CAF-1 establishes its role in coupling two important processes, DNA replication and epigenetic inheritance.

Trimeric PP2A consists of a structural A subunit, a catalytic C subunit, and a variable regulatory subunit. Variable subunits (B, B′, and B"" families) dictate PP2A substrate specificity and subcellular localization. B-family subunits contain seven WD repeats predicted to fold into a β-propeller structure. We carried out mutagenesis of Bγ to identify domains important for association with A and C subunits in vivo. Several internal deletions in Bγ abolished coimmunoprecipitation of A and C subunits expressed in COS-M6 cells. In contrast, small N- and C-terminal Bγ deletions had no effect on incorporation into the PP2A heterotrimer. Thus, holoenzyme association of B-family subunits requires multiple, precisely aligned contacts within a core β-propeller domain. Charge-reversal mutagenesis of Bγ identified a cluster of conserved critical residues in Bγ WD repeats 3 and 4. Acidic substitution of paired basic residues in Bγ (RR165EE) abolished association with wild-type A and C subunits, while fostering incorporation of Bγ into a PP2A heterotrimer containing an A subunit with an opposite charge-reversal mutation (EE100RR).

The balance of protein kinase and phosphatase activities toward key proteins is central to many aspects of cellular physiology. Compared with kinases, protein phosphatases have received little attention, and appreciation that they may be just as precisely regulated as the enzymes whose action they oppose is relatively recent. PP2A 1The abbreviations used are: PPprotein serine/threonine phosphatase1The abbreviations used are: PPprotein serine/threonine phosphatase is one of the four major classes of serine/threonine phosphatases that also include PP1, PP2B (calcineurin), and PP2C.

PP2A is a holoenzyme of two or three subunits. A 36-kDa catalytic or C subunit complexes with a 65-kDa scaffolding A subunit to form the AC core enzyme; the core enzyme can bind a third, variable subunit to form the PP2A heterotrimer. In mammals, A and C subunits are each encoded by two highly similar genes (Aα/β and Cα/β), with Aα and Cα isoforms being more abundant. Regulatory subunits are encoded by three multigene families referred to as B, B′, and B"". The B family (also known as PR55) consists of four genes, Bα, Bβ, Bγ, and Bδ, that give rise to proteins with molecular masses of 54–57 kDa (5Healy A.M. Zolnierowicz S. Stapleton A.E. Goebl M.

How regulatory subunits function to mediate the diverse physiological functions of PP2A is poorly understood. There is in vitro evidence that regulatory subunits affect enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of PP2A (33Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Lickteig R.L. Yang S.I. Craft C. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20139-20148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Localization studies have suggested that regulatory subunits target PP2A holoenzymes to distinct subcellular compartments (11McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the scaffolding Aα subunit of PP2A has been solved (34Groves M.R. Hanlon N. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 1999; 96: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), confirming a previous model based on secondary structure prediction and mutagenesis studies (35Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A subunit is a hook-shaped protein made up almost entirely of 15 imperfect repeats, each about 40 amino acids long. Each of these HEAT repeats (named after proteins that contain them: h untingtin, e longation factor,A subunit, and TOR kinase) consists of two antiparallel, amphipathic α-helices. Loops between the two helices (intrarepeat loops) form a continuous ridge along the inside of the hook, providing interaction surfaces for catalytic and regulatory subunits. Regulatory subunits and viral antigens bind to the 10 N-terminal repeats, whereas the catalytic subunit binds via repeats 11–15 (35Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ruediger R. Roeckel D. Fait J. Bergqvist A. Magnusson G. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The PP2A C subunit is thought to have a roughly globular structure similar to that of the related PP1 C subunit (37Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar,38Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Knowing how regulatory subunits fold and interact with the core PP2A dimer is crucial for our understanding of the diverse roles of PP2A in cells. Here, we carry out deletion and site-directed mutagenesis in combination with structure modeling to identify domains and amino acids important for holoenzyme association of B-family regulatory subunits. By complementary charge-reversal mutagenesis, we show that adjacent arginines in Bγ critically interact with adjacent glutamates in the Aα subunit. An amino acid alignment of B-family regulatory subunits from different phyla was submitted to the 3D-PSSM protein fold recognition web server (39Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), which generated a first-round model based on the structure of the Gβ1 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (40Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). This model was globally and locally optimized for bond lengths, angles, and torsions of side chains using the steepest decent algorithm of the Swiss PDB Viewer software (41Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). In addition, breaks in the Cα trace were ligated with a cutoff value of 3.0 Å, and missing hydrogen atoms were added to the model. Ribbon diagrams and surface representations of the optimized B subunit model were rendered, annotated, and analyzed using Rasmol and Swiss PDB Viewer software. The rat cDNA for Bγ was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from rat brain total RNA (Access reverse transcription-PCR kit; Promega, Madison, WI), subcloned into a pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and FLAG epitope tagged at the N terminus by PCR. The Bγ Δ26–38 and Δ379–447 mutants were generated by restriction digestion of the wild-type plasmid with uniquely cutting restriction enzymes, followed by fill-in and recircularization reactions. The Bγ Δ1–20 N-terminal truncation mutant was generated by PCR amplification of the coding sequence with nested primers encoding the FLAG tag and amino acids 21–25 of Bγ. Generation of internal deletion mutants involved PCR amplification of two halves of the Bγ cDNA-containing plasmid, one extending from the 5′ end of the deletion to approximately halfway around the plasmid, and the other extending from the 3′ deletion boundary to the same site in the vector backbone in the opposite direction. Reverse primers annealing to sequences 5′ of the deletion and forward primers annealing to 3′ deletion boundaries also included a unique SacII site encoding a neutral “stuffer” sequence (Ala, Ala-Ala, or Ala-Ala-Gly), and complementary forward and reverse primers annealing to the plasmid backbone introduced a unique AscI site. PCR-generated plasmid halves were digested with SacII and AscI and ligated to produce the complete plasmid carrying the deletion. The Bγ Δ434–447 and Δ440–447 C-terminal truncation mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of residues 434 and 440, respectively, to termination codons. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by whole-plasmid synthesis with complementary primers harboring mutations utilizing Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene), followed by destruction of the template plasmid by digestion with DpnI. All mutations were verified by automated sequencing. All Aα subunit plasmids have been described previously (42Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-M6 cells (43Horowitz M. Cepko C.L. Sharp P.A. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 147-159PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 4.5 g/liter glucose and seeded into 6-well plates for transfection on the next day at ∼80% confluence. Cells were transfected with 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of plasmid DNA. Aα and Bγ subunits plasmids were cotransfected at 1:1 mass ratios. After 36–48 h, cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 250 μl/well immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 μmmicrocystin-LR, 1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine), and sonicated for 2 s at low intensity with a probe tip sonicator. Debris was pelleted (20,000 × g, 15 min), and FLAG-tagged Bγ subunits were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate with 6 μl of anti-FLAG tag antibody (M2) conjugated to agarose (Sigma) by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 3–16 h. In some experiments, 200 μg/ml FLAG epitope peptide was added to the cleared lysate as a specificity control. Immunoprecipitates were washed with 6–8 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and solubilized in SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-FLAG tag (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), mouse anti-EE tag (Babco, Richmond, CA), mouse anti-PP2A catalytic subunit (BD PharMingen), and rabbit anti-ubiquitin (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK). Blots were processed for chemiluminescence detection (Pierce SuperSignal, Pierce, New York, NY), and digital images were captured on a Kodak Imaging Station 440. Signal intensities were quantified by digital densitometry using National Institutes of Health Image software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Mammalian B-family regulatory PP2A subunits (Bα-δ) display high degrees of sequence conservation (>80% amino acid identity). Secondary structure prediction suggests that B-family regulatory subunits are almost entirely composed of β-sheets and turns, whereas the B′ and B"" subunits are mostly α-helical. Thus, PP2A regulatory subunit families have distinct primary and secondary structures. As has been noted previously (44Griswold-Prenner I. Kamibayashi C. Maruoka E.M. Mumby M.C. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), B-family regulatory subunits contain several degenerate WD repeats (four to seven, depending on the isoform and motif search threshold). WD (also called WD40 or Gβ) repeats are loosely defined, ∼40-amino acid sequence motifs that often end with the tryptophan-aspartate (WD) dipeptide (45Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Bγ, a representative member of the B subunit family, aligned by WD repeat motifs is shown in Fig. 1 A. Seven degenerate WD repeats are separated by regions of 13–46 residues in length (c-d loops). The two WD repeat-containing proteins whose three-dimensional structure has been solved to date are the Gβ1 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (40Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) and the p40 subunit of the arp2/3 actin filament branching complex (p40-ARC; Ref. 46Robinson R.C. Turbedsky K. Kaiser D.A. Marchand J.B. Higgs H.N. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Both proteins fold into a seven-bladed β-propeller, a toroid structure in which seven twisted, antiparallel β-sheets are radially arranged around a common center. Each WD repeat contributes the outer (d) β-strand of one propeller blade and the inner three β-strands (a−c) of the next propeller blade (Fig. 1 B). This phase-shift of sequence and structural motifs allows for closure of the torus by a “velcro” mechanism (45Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Sequences preceding the first WD repeat and trailing the last repeat may protrude from the core toroid (Fig. 1 B). Three web-based threading protein fold prediction algorithms (3D-PSSM (39Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), FUGUE (47Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), and 123D (genomic.sanger.ac.uk/123D/123D.html)) identified Gβ1 as the closest structural homolog of PP2A B-family regulatory subunits, despite low sequence similarity (∼15% identity). The structure of B-family regulatory subunits was modeled based on the Gβ1 crystal structure (see “Experimental Procedures”). A ribbon diagram of this model shows the seven-bladed β-propeller fold characteristic of WD repeat-containing proteins (Fig. 1 C). Because PP2A B-family regulatory subunits are larger than Gβ1, portions of the larger loops connecting WD repeats are missing from the model. To define regions and residues in B-family regulatory subunits critical for association with the AC core dimer, we carried out deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the Bγ coding sequence. Mutant Bγ cDNAs carrying an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag were transiently expressed in COS-M6 cells in combination with the scaffolding Aα subunit tagged with a C-terminal EE epitope (42Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-Bγ was immunoprecipitated and washed extensively, and in vivo incorporation into the PP2A heterotrimer was assayed by blotting Bγ immunoprecipitates for transfected Aα and endogenous C subunits. The ability of Bγ mutants to associate with the core enzyme was quantified by densitometry as the ratio of C to Bγ subunit bands in the same lane. In general, mutating Bγ affected Aα and C subunit binding to similar degrees, supporting the notion that regulatory subunits interact with a structural unit of A and C subunits. A schematic diagram of the Bγ deletion and truncation mutants is shown in Fig. 2 A. B subunit family members differ considerably in their first 20–30 residues. Deletion of the variable 20 N-terminal amino acids of Bγ (Δ1–20) had little effect on binding to the A and C subunit (Fig. 2 B), consistent with a role of these residues in mediating isoform-specific functions. This deletion extends into the predicted first (d) β-strand of WD repeat 1, which, according to the crystal structures of Gβ1 and p40-ARC, is critical for closure of the β-propeller core by interacting with the c-strand of WD repeat 7 (see Fig. 1 B). It is conceivable that the FLAG epitope tag can substitute for the 5 residues deleted from WD repeat 1; alternatively, the boundaries of this structural motif in Bγ may require revision. At the C terminus, truncating the 8 amino acids that follow the last WD repeat in Bγ (Δ440–447) had no effect on holoenzyme association. Extending the truncation by just 6 amino acids (Δ434–447) to include the predicted c-strand of WD repeat 7 caused an almost complete loss of A and C subunit binding. Thus, residues 434–439 are required for holoenzyme association, presumably because they interact with N-terminal residues to maintain the toroid structure of Bγ. Four internal deletions throughout the Bγ protein ranging from 12 to 32 residues in length completely abrogated coimmunoprecipitation of A and C subunits (3–7% of wild-type); only the Δ381–401 deletion displayed close to wild-type binding activity (Fig. 2 B). Three of these critical deletions (Δ128–156, Δ259–270, and Δ370–401) are predicted to affect surface-exposed loops connecting WD repeats, whereas Δ26–38 deletes a portion of WD repeat 1 predicted to be buried in the protein. The apparent intolerance of the Bγ core (residues 21–439) to small deletions suggests that the interaction of B-family subunits with the AC dimer requires precise alignment of multiple interacting residues. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to delineate specific sites of holoenzyme interaction. All Bγ residues that were mutated are perfectly conserved in other mammalian B-family isoforms and their orthologs in worms, fruit flies, and yeast. Carrying out similar mutagenesis experiments with the Aα subunit, we had previously identified charged residues in HEAT repeats 3 (Glu100 and Glu101) and 5 (Arg183) important for binding to regulatory subunits and viral tumor antigens (42Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we focused the Bγ mutagenesis on charge-reversal of basic and acidic residues with the goal of identifying electrostatic interactions with the Aα subunit. Three acidic-to-basic mutations of conserved residues in the N-terminal third of Bγ (E66R, EE89RR, and D112K) had no effect on holoenzyme association (Fig. 3). In contrast, four Bγ mutants in WD repeat 3 (RR165EE, D184K, E186R, and DD192RR) and two mutants in the loop connecting WD repeat 3 and WD repeat 4 (D212K and IK213EE) displayed severely reduced binding to A and C subunits (between 2% and 12% of wild-type). Mapping to WD repeat 4, Bγ mutant ED219RR incorporated into the PP2A holoenzyme normally, whereas E223R was defective. Because Bγ Δ259–270 was binding-incompetent (Fig. 2 B), we tested the effect of mutating all acidic residues in this region. Bγ D259R did not bind to the AC dimer, whereas Bγ EE266RR, E269R, and D270R had little or no effect on the ability of Bγ to associate with A and C subunits. Lastly, the E343R mutation in WD repeat 6 had an intermediate effect on the ability of Bγ to incorporate into the PP2A heterotrimer (40% residual binding of the C subunit; Fig. 3). The results of the deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments are summarized in Fig. 3 B. Bγ mutants were classified as critical or noncritical depending on the amount of coimmunoprecipitated C subunit (<15% and ≥40% of wild-type, respectively). Most critical amino acid substitutions cluster in the middle of the molecule (165–259) encompassing WD repeats 3 and 4. Li and Virshup (48Li X. Virshup D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have recently reported that two fragments of B′α can bind to the Aα subunit in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Intriguingly, the corresponding regions in Bα and B""/PR72 also interacted with Aα, even though PP2A regulatory subunit families display little primary amino acid similarity and are classified into different structural families according to protein fold prediction algorithms (39Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 47Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The N-terminal “A subunit binding domain” defined by Li and Virshup corresponds to Bγ residues 172–270, a region that we show here contains many residues necessary for holoenzyme association in vivo. The C-terminal A subunit binding domain encompasses Bγ residues 302–360. We mutated E343 in this region, which, according to Li and Virshup's domain alignment (48Li X. Virshup D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is invariant in B, B′, B"" subunits, and we observed an intermediate effect on PP2A holoenzyme formation. We speculated that evolutionarily conserved and surface-exposed, charged residues of Bγ interact with residues of opposite charge in Aα that we previously identified as critical for regulatory subunit association (Glu100, Glu101, and Arg183; Ref.42Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we coexpressed charge-reversal mutants of the Aα subunit (EE100RR and R183E) with all opposite charge-reversal mutants of the Bγ subunit and tested for complementation, i.e. restoration of holoenzyme assembly by coimmunoprecipitation. We were unable to show association of any of the acidic-to-basic mutants of Bγ with the basic-to-acidic mutant Aα R183E (data not shown). There are three potential reasons for this: 1) we may have not mutated the interacting residue in Bγ, 2) Aα or Bγ mutations, while potentially affecting interacting residues, may introduce structural changes that misalign other important amino acids, and 3) Aα R183 may not interact directly with regulatory subunits. However, when we paired Aα EE100RR with Bγ RR165EE, we observed binding that was comparable to wild-type subunits (Fig. 4). Bγ RR165EE was unable to coimmunoprecipitate another binding-defective, acidic-to-basic Aα mutant, DW139RR (data not shown), demonstrating that the observed complementation is not a consequence of altering the overall charge of the proteins. Thus, PP2A holoenzyme association is critically dependent on electrostatic interactions between adjacent glutamates in the A subunit (Glu100 and Glu101 in Aα) and adjacent arginines in B-family regulatory subunits (Arg165and Arg166 in Bγ). Because the EE100RR mutation in Aα interferes with binding of all regulatory subunit families (42Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that B′ and B"" subunits also interact via basic residues. We reversed the charge of a pair of conserved lysine residues in B′ε that is in a position similar to Bγ Arg165 and Arg166(B′ε KK173DD), but this mutation did not disrupt PP2A holoenzyme assembly (data not shown). Additional studies are necessary to identify points of contact between Aα and B′/B"" subunits. All Bγ mutants could be expressed to similar, high levels in COS-M6 cells, a cell line that supports plasmid replication due to expression of the SV40 large T antigen. Studying the effects of Bγ mutants in the neuronal PC6-3 subline of PC12 cells (49Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which much lower levels of expression can be achieved, we noticed that holoenzyme formation-defective mutants could be expressed to at most 10% of wild-type Bγ levels. This is shown for two mutants in Fig. 5 A. Importantly, expression levels of Bγ RR165EE, but not D212K, could be rescued by coexpression of the complementary Aα EE100RR mutant, indicating that low expression is a consequence of failure to incorporate into the PP2A holoenzyme. To investigate the mechanism of this effect, PC6-3 cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 2 h before immunoblotting. Proteasome inhibition resulted in a massive increase of Bγ protein levels but had no effect on levels of another transfected protein (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα) or the endogenous PP2A C subunit (Fig. 5 B). MG-132 treatment led to the accumulation of higher molecular weight species of Bγ D212K that were immunoreactive for ubiquitin (Fig. 5 C). Similar results were obtained with the RR165EE mutant and wild-type Bγ. It was previously shown that transfected B′ subunits quantitatively incorporate into the PP2A holoenzyme (11McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and that ablation of PP2A A or C subunits by RNA interference decreases the stability of regulatory subunits in Drosophila Schneider cells (25Silverstein A.M. Barrow C.A. Davis A.J. Mumby M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The present results provide further evidence that PP2A subunit expression levels are stringently controlled in cells and suggest ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation as a mechanism for rapid removal of monomeric regulatory subunits. Structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis support the model of PP2A holoenzyme structure shown in Fig. 6. B-family regulatory subunits adopt a β-propeller fold that is found in other proteins engaged in multiple protein-protein interactions (40Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 46Robinson R.C. Turbedsky K. Kaiser D.A. Marchand J.B. Higgs H.N. Choe S. Pollard T.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1679-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). By mutational complementation, we identified electrostatic interactions between two conserved arginines in the outer (d) strand of WD repeat 3 of Bγ and two glutamates in the intrarepeat loop of HEAT repeat 3 of Aα. Previous domain mapping and site-directed mutagenesis of the A subunit (35Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ruediger R.

Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the present data argue for multiple additional contacts between regulatory and scaffolding subunits. Also, regulatory subunit binding to the AC dimer is likely stabilized by direct interactions between B and C subunits, possibly involving the carboxyl-methylated C terminus of the C subunit (50Wu J. Tolstykh T. Lee J. Boyd K. Stock J.B. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5672-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 51Tolstykh T. Lee J. Vafai S. Stock J.B.

Critical amino acids in Bγ are located C-terminal of the A subunit-contacting residues Arg165 and Arg166 and cluster in WD repeats 3 and 4 and the intervening loop. We propose that this region forms extensive contacts with the intrarepeat loops of HEAT repeats 4–7 of the Aα subunit, where many residues important for regulatory subunit binding are localized (42Ruediger R. Fields K. Walter G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 839-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with possible isoform-specific functions, we find that the divergent N-terminal tail of Bγ is expendable for intersubunit interactions. Instead, N-terminal residues of B-family regulatory subunits may determine the subcellular localization of PP2A holoenzymes by interacting with specific anchoring proteins (19Strack S. Zaucha J.A. Ebner F.F. Colbran R.J. Wadzinski B.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 392: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Compatible with this view, the Bγ N terminus faces away from the A subunit in our PP2A holoenzyme model. This report addresses the structural basis of PP2A holoenzyme function but requires ultimate verification and refinement by other methods such as crystallography.

https://openalex.org/W2083264092,"The nanomechanical properties of thin silicon films will become increasingly critical in semiconductor devices, particularly in the context of substrates that consist of a silicon film on an insulating layer (known as silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, substrates). Here we use very small germanium crystals as a new type of nanomechanical stressor to demonstrate a surprising mechanical behaviour of the thin layer of silicon in SOI substrates, and to show that there is a large local reduction in the viscosity of the oxide on which the silicon layer rests. These findings have implications for the use of SOI substrates in nanoelectronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2000388293,"An antiparallel actin dimer has been proposed to be an intermediate species during actin filament nucleation. We now show that latrunculin A, a marine natural product that inhibits actin polymerization, arrests polylysine-induced nucleation at the level of an antiparallel dimer, resulting in its accumulation. These dimers, when composed of pyrene-labeled actin subunits, give rise to a fluorescent excimer, permitting detection during polymerization in vitro. We report the crystallographic structure of the polylysine-actin-latrunculin A complex at 3.5-Å resolution. The non-crystallographic contact is consistent with a dimeric structure and confirms the antiparallel orientation of its subunits. The crystallographic contacts reveal that the mobile DNase I binding loop of one subunit of a symmetry-related antiparallel actin dimer is partially stabilized in the interface between the two subunits of a second antiparallel dimer.

These results provide a potential explanation for the paradoxical nucleation of actin filaments that have exclusively parallel subunits by a dimer containing antiparallel subunits. Actin filament nucleation occurs very slowly de novo, but it occurs rapidly as a necessary step in actin-based motility (1Blanchoin L. Amann K.J. Higgs H.N. Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The formation of a dimer from monomeric subunits is the most thermodynamically unfavorable nucleation step with an estimated equilibrium dissociation constant of 4.6 m (in contrast to 0.6 mm for conversion of dimer to trimer) in a recent molecular dynamic simulation of nucleation (2Sept D. McCammon J.A. Biophys J. 2001; 81: 667-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The formation of an effective nucleus may be accelerated in vivo by an actin-binding protein such as gelsolin, which can stabilize dimeric actin, or by a protein complex such as Arp2/3 that is thought to contain two actin-like molecules constrained in an orientation that promotes nucleation (3Burtnick L.D.

Antiparallel actin dimers have been identified as a precursor to actin filament polymerization by covalent cross-linking during polymerization induced with divalent cations (5Millonig R. Salvo H. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A gelsolin-actin complex capable of nucleating filament growth at the slow growing, pointed end of filaments has also been shown by covalent cross-linking to contain two actin subunits in the antiparallel configuration (6Hesterkamp T. Weeds A.G. Mannherz H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The assumption of an antiparallel configuration of subunits is based on evidence that Cys-374 in the C terminus of actin is the only residue involved in the cross-linking reaction. In contrast, when polymerization is complete, intrafilament cross-linking yields a parallel dimer. More recently, electron microscopy has revealed that newly formed actin filaments show evidence of incorporation of antiparallel dimers. This incorporation results in a branched filament network, implying that the dimers have nucleating activity (7Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of a Listeria model of cell motility using high-resolution laser tracking provides evidence that filaments elongate in 5.4 nm steps, consistent with in vivo incorporation of dimeric actin (8Kuo S.C. McGrath J.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the current work, we provide evidence that polylysine nucleates actin polymerization by enhancing the stability of an antiparallel dimer and that the production of antiparallel dimer induced by polylysine and other nucleation-promoting agents correlates well temporally with filament nucleation. We show that the polylysine-induced dimer accumulates in the presence of latrunculin A, generating a homogeneous complex that can be crystallized. An x-ray structure of an antiparallel dimer is reported that correlates well with the available biochemical data for the solution dimer. Polymerization of pyrene-labeled rabbit muscle actin 1Pyrene-labeled actin is defined as actin labeled on Cys-374 with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide. (4% of actin was labeled except when detecting excimer, in which case 73% was labeled) was measured at 22 °C using a PTI spectrofluorimeter with excitation at 366 nm and emission at 387 nm. Actin in buffer G (0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.01% sodium azide, and 5.0 mm Tris, pH 7.8) was converted to Mg2+-actin by the addition of 125 μm EGTA and 50 μm MgCl2 15 min prior to the initiation of polymerization. For covalent cross-linking, actin, polylysine, and latrunculin A were mixed at the indicated concentrations. Polylysine (Sigma) with low polydispersity (weight-average Mr/number-average Mr is 1.1) had an average of 24 lysine residues.

Samples of 110 μl reached equilibrium in 36 h at 4 °C. Buffer density was 1.0015, and the partial specific volume for the complex was assumed to be that of actin alone, 0.72 ml/g (9Bubb M.R. Spector I. Beyer B.B. Fosen K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For sedimentation velocity, 400-μl samples were loaded into double sector cells at 20 °C. Absorbance scans were obtained at 12-min intervals at 290 nm. Sedimentation coefficients were calculated using the second-moment analysis method (10Schachman H.K. Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1959: 75-81Google Scholar). Theoretical sedimentation coefficients were calculated using HYDROPRO (11Garcia de la Torre J. Carrasco B. Harding S.E. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using the atomic coordinates of the antiparallel dimer or of a compact dimer in which two subunits interact via DNase I binding loop contacts with subdomains 1 and 3 as shown in Fig. 6 A. Crystals of the polylysine-actin-latrunculin A-ATP complex were grown at 4 °C from a solution of equimolar latrunculin A and actin at a concentration of 240 μm with 120 μm polylysine using vapor diffusion. The crystallization buffer contained 1.3 mNH4SO4, 1.0 mm ATP, 3.0 mm MgCl2, and 60 mm imidazole, pH 6.7. The crystals were extremely x-ray sensitive, and the x-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature to 3.5-Å resolution using an R-AXIS IV++ system. Attempted collection of cryogenic data was unsuccessful. A total of 120 diffraction images were collected from eight actin crystals. Data were indexed using HKL software (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar) with a Rmerge of 0.115. The diffraction from these crystals is consistent with the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit cell parameters 101.46, 103.03, and 126.96 Å. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two actin molecules, which results in a Matthews coefficient (VM) of 3.95 Å3/Da and solvent fraction of 70.6%, consistent with our previous report based on crystal density (13Yarmola E.G.

The cross-rotation function search was calculated on a 3° grid with a radius of 40 Å in the 20–3.5 Å resolution range. This search produced a clear solution with the two highest peaks, 11.74 and 11.06 ς, corresponding to two independent G-actin molecules related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis. A translation function search with a proposed structure of rabbit muscle F-actin monomer (16Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W.

The F-actin monomer was selected as a starting point for refinement because the crystallization conditions (3 mmMgCl2) strongly favored conversion of G- to F-actin. A second translation function search for actin dimer composed of the two independent actin monomers had a correlation coefficient of 0.680 and an R-factor of 0.337 at the position x = 0.348, y = 0.276 and z = 0.773. The resulting actin dimer model was refined using crystallography NMR software version 1.1 (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Initially, rigid body refinement was carried out with each monomer defined as an independent rigid body. Procedures carried out with CNS included simulated annealing using a maximum likelihood target function, restrained individual B-factor refinement conjugate gradient minimization, and bulk solvent correction. The model was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.192 and Rfree of 0.252 for all data (50–3.5 Å) (5% of the data were sequestered before molecular replacement and were used for calculation of the Rfree value in CNS refinement). The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. Actin filament nucleation is fast in vitro when a short oligomer of polylysine is present (Fig. 1 A). The effect of polylysine is very potent relative to molecules such as phalloidin or jasplakinolide, which promote nucleation by binding at the interface of three subunits to stabilize a helical actin trimer (Fig. 1 B). Given the enhanced intrinsic stability of trimer relative to dimer, an observed effect greater than that caused by a very high affinity actin-trimer ligand such as jasplakinolide is likely related to modulation of actin dimer formation (9Bubb M.R. Spector I. Beyer B.B. Fosen K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Indeed, if actin is covalently cross-linked during polymerization induced by polylysine, a substantial yield of antiparallel dimers with high electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE is obtained (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the cross-linking results, polylysine, at saturation, changes the slope of a log-log plot of the time required to reach 50% completion of polymerization versus actin concentration from 2.03 for the control data to 1.17. This is most consistent with a change in nucleus size as defined by Oosawa and Asakura (18Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein. Academic Press, New York1975: 28-55Google Scholar) (and also Ref. 19Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from four to two subunits, as might be expected if polylysine enhances the stability of dimeric actin (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the potent actin filament stabilizing compound jasplakinolide changed the slope to 1.56, suggesting a nucleus size of 3, consistent with its known binding location (9Bubb M.R. Spector I. Beyer B.B. Fosen K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar).Figure 2Accumulation of antiparallel actin dimers with latrunculin A. A, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of PDM covalent cross-linking of 3.0 μm Mg2+-actin subunits during the first 12 min of polymerization after addition of 2.0 mmMgCl2 and polylysine. Cross-linking at 0.5:1 ratio of PDM/actin is optimal for detection of antiparallel dimer with or without polylysine (lanes 1 and 2). Cross-linking at a 4:1 ratio of PDM/actin allows detection of intrafilament dimer (43Elzinga M. Phelan J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6599-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with varying polylysine concentrations (lanes 3–5, respectively). When 8 μmlatrunculin A is added to prevent polymer formation, cross-linking at 0.5:1 ratio of PDM/actin yields only antiparallel dimer with 3.0 μm actin and 1.5 μm polylysine (lane 6). Lane 7 is identical to lane 2 except actin was polymerized for 60 min prior to cross-linking.

The solid line shows the best fit to the data assuming actin is dimeric, and the dashed line shows the best fit to monomeric actin. The upper panel shows the distribution of residuals relative to the theoretical curve for dimeric actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The yield of cross-linked antiparallel dimer is substantially higher when polylysine is used to nucleate polymerization than has been previously reported for other polymer-inducing conditions (5Millonig R. Salvo H. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). If cross-linking is performed as the polymerization reaction nears completion then the yield of antiparallel dimer is significantly less, and the major cross-linked product is then an intrafilament dimer with lower electrophoretic mobility. (Lane 7 of Fig. 2 A shows the depletion of antiparallel dimer with time.) Both the cross-linking pattern of mature filaments and the normal appearance of negatively stained polylysine-induced filaments (20Brown S.S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggest that polylysine does not alter filament structure. However, if the actin-monomer sequestering drug latrunculin A (13Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) is added at the initiation of polymerization, polymerization is arrested at the dimeric stage, and the antiparallel dimer accumulates (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). The cross-linking reaction is not 100% efficient, and therefore monomer is expected to be visible on an SDS-denatured gel even if the dimer is homogeneous in solution. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments (performed at 4 °C as previously described (21Terry D.R. Spector I. Higa T. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7841-7845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with a mixture of actin, polylysine, and latrunculin A, at concentrations of 5, 2.5, and 12 μm, respectively) confirm that actin is homogeneously dimeric (Fig. 2 B), even in the presence of high concentrations of divalent cation (2 mm MgCl2). Results of sedimentation velocity experiments (data not shown) performed under identical conditions (except at a temperature of 20 °C) also reveal a homogeneous species with sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 4.81 ± 0.10 S. Because these results show that the actin is dimeric in solution rather than filamentous, the antiparallel cross-link cannot be the result of interfilament cross-linking in a bundle of filaments, as has been speculated to occur in other conditions (7Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cross-linking and sedimentation equilibrium experiments in the presence of excess latrunculin A showed no evidence of dimer formation in the absence of polylysine. The finding that an antiparallel dimer was an intermediate species during polylysine-induced actin polymerization was unanticipated. Given the parallel orientation of subunits in an actin filament, the antiparallel geometry is paradoxical, with a requisite large change in subunit orientation if both subunits are incorporated into a filament. Moreover, in general, conditions that provoke rapid nucleation,e.g. 2.0 mm MgCl2, have previously been associated with relatively lower yields of antiparallel dimer (5Millonig R. Salvo H. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Indeed, because of these considerations, it has been speculated that the antiparallel dimer could be an inert product of a bimolecular reaction mechanism that is independent of actin polymerization (7Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The evidence that ubiquitous antiparallel dimer formation correlates well temporally with nucleation events and the evidence of incorporation during filament polymerization argue that this is not the case (6Hesterkamp T. Weeds A.G. Mannherz H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our new data for polylysine are particularly convincing in this regard, as the apparent abundance of antiparallel dimer during extremely rapid polymerization is difficult to reconcile with the idea that the dimer represents actin diverted to an unpolymerizable state. For more than 20 years since the discovery of the antiparallel actin dimer (5Millonig R. Salvo H. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8228-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) there has been no technique to allow for its detection other than covalent cross-linking, a procedure requiring extended incubation times and high pH levels (5Millonig R. Salvo H. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We now find evidence that pyrene-labeled actin forms an excimer in the antiparallel dimer (and not in F- or G-actin), providing a “real-time” assay for monitoring its formation (Fig. 3 A). Because the presence of excimer implies that the pyrene fluorophores are less than 18 Å apart (23Kim E. Reisler E. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 86: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), this is consistent with the biochemical evidence of antiparallel dimer. Of course, this is not proof that antiparallel dimer is present whenever excimer is detected nor proof of the converse. However, the strong correlation between dimer formation and conditions/times yielding cross-linking of antiparallel dimer suggests that these conclusions are reasonable. Polylysine induces rapid formation of excimer, which decreases in abundance with time (Fig. 3 B). The less potent polycationic nucleating factor, the phosphorylation site domain of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS PSD), causes accumulation of excimer at a slower rate followed by depletion during polymerization (Fig. 3 B). Polymerization of Ca2+-actin is accompanied by the formation of a small amount of excimer during the time interval that corresponds to filament nucleation (Fig. 3 C), providing the first corroborating evidence of antiparallel dimer formation during in vitro polymerization of Ca2+-actin. Dimer homogeneity in the presence of latrunculin A unexpectedly implied that polylysine, even though it strongly promoted two-dimensional polymerization, could be exploited to make crystals of actin. Successful crystallization conditions were as previously reported for a complex of latrunculin A and actin (13Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The use of polylysine led to much more rapid crystallization, occurring in as little as a week at 4 °C compared with 3–5 months in the absence of polylysine at this temperature. These crystals diffracted X-rays to 3.5-Å resolution, and the structure was determined with refinement of the data to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.192 and Rfree of 0.252. Consistent with the biochemical data shown in Fig. 2, the structure reported here is that of an antiparallel dimer (Fig. 4). A disulfide bond can be identified between the Cys-374 residues (Fig. 5). In comparison, previously reported crystallographic structures of actin have either required the presence of an actin-binding protein that prevents polymerization (24Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 25McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G.

Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). These other structures have no demonstrable non-crystallographic actin-actin interactions indicative of oligomerization.

Open table in a new tab The most extensive crystallographic packing interaction involves the DNase I binding loop, with a buried interfacial surface area of 2.5 × 103 Å2. The DNase I binding loop of one subunit of one dimer is sandwiched within a pocket created by two subunits of a second dimer (Fig. 6 A). Within each dimer the interaction confers stability to only one loop; the other one is disordered. The ordered loop has a significantly different conformation compared with prior reported actin structures, indicating extensive flexibility, as had been previously suggested by both electron microscopic and crystallographic data (25McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 26Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 28Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The loop is highly extended with its hydrophobic surface buried within the non-crystallographic dimer interface (Fig. 6 B). The DNase I binding loop conformation reported here is unlike that recently described for the crystal structure of a covalently modified form of ADP-actin that is polymerization incompetent, in which a portion of the loop is α-helical (27Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and also is different from the compact structure identified in a complex of profilin and β-actin (26Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, the conformation of this loop is similar to that for actin subunits in a model of F-actin (29Tirion M.M. ben-Avraham D. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 5-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and, moreover, is similar to that for profilin-bound actin in the open state, a structure hypothesized to be the precursor complex that adds to the barbed end of growing filaments (30Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In light of a previous report that <0.1 kcal/mol might be required for the transition between the two most extreme positions of subdomain 2 shown in Fig. 6 C, the full range of depicted conformations are likely represented in solution (30Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our results, therefore, suggest that the DNase I binding loop is likely molded into the observed conformation by its interaction with an antiparallel actin dimer. Alternatively, dimerization, like many other binding events at the C terminus of actin (31Orlova A. Prochniewicz E. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), may have induced allosteric changes in the conformation of the DNase I binding loop, but this is unlikely because both DNase I binding loops are not similarly structured in this otherwise symmetrical antiparallel dimer. Nucleation of actin polymerization by antiparallel dimer as reported here has been previously observed qualitatively (7Steinmetz M.O. Goldie K.N. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The relationship between the crystallographic and solution structures of antiparallel actin dimer is of interest. The disulfide bond that we observe in the crystallographic structure very likely does not form until after crystallization is complete, given that the PDM cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation data prove definitively that the dimer exists in solution without a disulfide (the PDM reaction requires a reduced cysteine). The flexibility of the C terminus reported by others may account for the observation that a finite length, covalent cross-linking reagent such as PD"
https://openalex.org/W1974041592,"Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3) is an ∼55-kDa protein that functions as a cofactor for Crm1-mediated nuclear export. RanBP3 stimulates export by enhancing the affinity of Crm1 for Ran·GTP and cargo. However, important additional functions for this cofactor may exist. We now report that RanBP3 associates with the Ran-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1). This interaction was stimulated by the addition of Ran; moreover, Ran·GDP, Ran·GTP, and Ran without nucleotide could all stimulate complex formation between RanBP3 and RCC1 even though binding of Ran·GDP to RanBP3 alone was undetectable. RanBP3 could also promote binding of Crm1 to RCC1 in the presence of Ran. Binding of RanBP3 to RCC1 increased the catalytic activity of RCC1 toward Ran, and importantly, the ability of RanBP3 to stimulate RCC1 was not affected by the presence of Crm1. These data indicate that RanBP3 acts as a scaffold protein to promote the efficient assembly of export complexes. By tethering Crm1 to catalytically enhanced RCC1, RanBP3 may lower the entropic barrier for the loading of Ran·GTP onto Crm1. We propose that this provides an additional mechanism by which RanBP3 facilitates export.

Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The NPC contains a central channel that permits transit of cargoes between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The NPC is composed of proteins called nucleoporins that possess binding sites for nuclear transport receptors. These receptors (called importins, exportins, transportins, and karyopherins) are able to bind simultaneously to their cargo and nucleoporins to allow transport from one compartment to the other. nuclear pore complex Ran-binding protein 3 Ran-binding domain regulator of chromosome condensation 1 GTPase-activating protein glutathione S-transferase leucine-rich nuclear export signal 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin The Ran GTPase controls most vectorial transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Like other GTPases, Ran cycles between GDP- and GTP-bound states. A single guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RCC1) and GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) catalyze the Ran GDP/GTP cycle (4Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). These proteins possess distinct subcellular localizations. While RanGAP is localized to the cytoplasm and NPC (6Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), RCC1 is a nuclear protein tethered to chromatin through histones H2A/H2B (6Hopper A.K.

The disparate subcellular localizations of RanGAP and RCC1 predict a steep gradient of Ran·GTP across the nuclear envelope, which is crucial for most forms of nuclear transport. A defining characteristic of β-karyopherin transport receptors is their direct interaction with Ran·GTP. The effect of Ran on the interaction between the receptor and its cargo is dependent upon the nature of the transport receptor. Ran·GTP dissociates cargo from import receptors, while in contrast, Ran·GTP is required for an export receptor to bind its cargo (1Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Upon transit of an export complex into the cytoplasm, hydrolysis of Ran·GTP to Ran·GDP causes release of the cargo from the export receptor. Thus, one essential function of Ran is to regulate the interactions between receptors and cargo in a compartment-specific manner. The best characterized nuclear export receptor is Crm1 (also called exportin-1 or Xpo1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Crm1 is able to associate with Ran·GTP and with cargo proteins harboring a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) (9Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

The Crm1-cargo-Ran·GTP complex translocates across the NPC and is then dissociated by hydrolysis of GTP on Ran, stimulated by RanGAP and other required factors. Recently several cofactors have been identified that enhance nuclear export by Crm1. Nxt1 binds directly to Crm1 and Ran and facilitates the delivery of the export complex to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC (13Black B.E. Holaska J.M. Levesque L. Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another protein, eukaryotic initiation factor-5A, may enhance the affinity of Crm1 for the NES of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 protein Rev (14Hofmann W. Reichart B. Ewald A. Muller E.

Most recently Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3) has been shown to enhance nuclear export mediated by Crm1 (15Lindsay M.E. Holaska J.M. Welch K. Paschal B.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Englmeier L. Fornerod M. Bischoff F.R. Petosa C. Mattaj I.W. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 926-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). RanBP3 binds directly to Crm1, and the Crm1-RanBP3 complex has an enhanced affinity for both Ran·GTP and cargo. The quaternary Crm1-RanBP3-Ran·GTP-NES complex is able to interact with the NPC, mediating transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the absence of Ran·GTP, RanBP3 prevents Crm1 from binding the NPC, thereby preventing futile export events. Here we describe an additional independent mechanism by which RanBP3 may enhance nuclear export by Crm1. We demonstrate that RanBP3 can interact with the Ran exchange factor RCC1 in a Ran-stimulated manner. This interaction increases the catalytic activity of RCC1, accelerating nucleotide exchange by ∼10-fold. The activation of RCC1 by RanBP3 can be amplified by histones H2A/H2B, suggesting that RanBP3 can stimulate RCC1 at the chromatin surface. Furthermore, RanBP3 can promote binding of Crm1 to RCC1, thereby tethering the export receptor to a region of accelerated nucleotide exchange. We propose that RanBP3 acts as a scaffold protein to promote the efficient assembly of Crm1-dependent export complexes. All glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (17Nemergut M.E. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).

Yeast dihybrid mating assays were performed as described previously (15Lindsay M.E. Holaska J.M. Welch K. Paschal B.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Plafker S.M. Macara I.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5502-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, bait plasmids encoding RCC1 or RCC1(D182A) fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 were transformed into HF7c (MATa). Prey plasmids encoding RanBP3 fused to the transactivation domain of VP16 were transformed into W303 (MAT α). The strains were mated and plated on Leu−Trp−His− medium. RCC1-catalyzed exchange assays were performed as described previously (7Nemergut M.E. Mizzen C.A. Stukenberg T. Allis C.D. Macara I.G. Science. 2001; 292: 1540-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant Ran was loaded with [α-32P]GDP or [α-32P]GTP by incubation in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.1) and 1 mmEDTA. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm MgCl2. All exchange assays were performed at 30 °C for 3 min in exchange assay buffer (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.1), 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm GTP or GDP as indicated) containing ∼0.6 nm RCC1. Reactions were stopped by binding to nitrocellulose filters using a vacuum apparatus. After washing the filters with ice-cold buffer (7.5 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 7.5 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 6.8), 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm ATP), the reactions were analyzed by scintillation counting. Dissociation rate constants (koff) were calculated assuming a single exponential decay (ln(Ct /C0) = −koff t, where C0 is the radioactive counts at time 0 and Ct is the counts at time t). RCC1 was visualized using an anti-RCC1 antibody (1:200; N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody (1:20,000; The Jackson Laboratories). RanBP3 was detected using anti-RanBP3 serum. Crm1 was visualized using anti-Crm1 serum (a kind gift of Larry Gerace) (15Lindsay M.E. Holaska J.M. Welch K. Paschal B.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Ran was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-Ran antibody (1:2,000; Transduction Laboratories) and a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:20,000; The Jackson Laboratories). GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose (Pharmacia) in phosphate-buffered saline. After blocking the beads for 1 h at 4 °C in 5% BSA, phosphate-buffered saline (w/v), binding reactions were accomplished in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmGDP or GTP). Wild-type Ran was treated with immobilized GST-RanGAP for 90 min at 25 °C prior to use in binding assays to ensure that all Ran protein was GDP-bound. For all binding reactions, the indicated form of Ran (10 μm), RanBP3 (10 μm), RCC1 (10 μm), or Crm1 (1 μm) was added. For all assays using Crm1, the binding buffer was modified by increasing the NaCl and 2-mercaptoethanol to 300 and 28 mm, respectively. Beads were then washed in binding buffer without BSA. One-half of the total bound proteins and 120 of the total unbound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. RanBP3 has been shown to stimulate Crm1-dependent nuclear export of NES-bearing cargoes in part by increasing the affinity of Crm1 for its substrate (15Lindsay M.E. Holaska J.M. Welch K. Paschal B.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Englmeier L. Fornerod M. Bischoff F.R. Petosa C. Mattaj I.W. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 926-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether RanBP3 has additional distinct functions in nuclear transport. RanBP3 was originally cloned from a yeast two-hybrid screen using RCC1 as bait (20Mueller L. Cordes V.C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which suggested that RanBP3 might play a role in regulating nucleotide exchange on Ran. We first confirmed this interaction using a yeast dihybrid mating assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, RCC1 was able to support growth in a RanBP3-dependent manner. These data suggest that RCC1 and RanBP3 are able to interact. However, RCC1(D182A), a mutant that is unable to interact with Ran and catalyze nucleotide exchange (21Azuma Y. Seino H. Seki T. Uzawa S. Klebe C. Ohba T. Wittinghofer A. Hayashi N. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), did not support growth with RanBP3. Therefore, the RCC1-RanBP3 interaction appears to be dependent upon the ability of RCC1 to interact with Ran. These data are in agreement with those reported previously for RanBP3 (20Mueller L. Cordes V.C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the S. cerevisiae homologue Yrb2p (22Taura T. Schlenstedt G. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31877-31884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ran acts as a bridge to link RCC1 and RanBP3, we first analyzed the ability of RanBP3 to interact with Ran. RCC1 can interact with both Ran·GDP and Ran·GTP (4Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 23Klebe C. Prinz H. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12543-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); in contrast, RanBP3 has been reported to bind specifically, although with low affinity, only to Ran·GTP (20Mueller L. Cordes V.C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test these interactions, GST-tagged RanBP3 (GST-RanBP3) or GST alone was immobilized to GSH beads and incubated with Ran(Q69L) (a mutant Ran locked in the GTP-bound state) (5Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) or wild-type Ran·GDP. As shown in Fig. 1 B, RanBP3 bound Ran(Q69L)·GTP; however, the affinity of RanBP3 for Ran·GDP was too low to be detectable. These data suggest that RanBP3 can only interact directly with Ran·GTP. We were also able to detect a direct interaction between RCC1 and RanBP3 (Fig. 1 C); however, the interaction appeared very weak and only slightly above background. In contrast, the addition of Ran·GTP stimulated binding of RCC1 to RanBP3 by forming a trimeric complex between Ran, RCC1, and RanBP3 as reported previously (20Mueller L. Cordes V.C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly Ran·GDP was also able to form a trimeric complex with RCC1 and RanBP3. Thus, although RanBP3 cannot interact with Ran·GDP directly (Fig. 1 B), it is able to recognize Ran·GDP when bound to RCC1 (Fig. 1 C). Ran depleted of bound nucleotide by treatment with EDTA and alkaline phosphatase could also form a trimeric complex with RCC1 and RanBP3 (data not shown). Therefore, in the presence of RCC1, RanBP3 is able to recognize Ran irrespective of its nucleotide state. RanBP3 contains other domains in addition to the Ran-binding domain (RBD) (15Lindsay M.E. Holaska J.M. Welch K. Paschal B.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine which region of RanBP3 is responsible for the formation of the trimeric complex, we tested two fragments of the protein for binding to RCC1. The isolated RBD (GST-R) bound RCC1 in the presence of Ran·GTP, while a fragment that lacks the RBD (GST-NF) did not bind RCC1 (Fig. 1 D). Therefore, the RanBP3 RBD is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the interaction between RanBP3, Ran, and RCC1. Because RanBP3 can bind several of the putative reaction intermediates of RCC1-catalyzed nucleotide exchange (23Klebe C. Prinz H. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12543-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we asked whether RanBP3 affects the enzymatic activity of RCC1. Ran, preloaded with [α-32P]GDP or [α-32P]GTP, was incubated with a fixed amount of RCC1 in the presence or absence of RanBP3. As shown in Fig. 2, RanBP3 stimulated the catalytic activity of RCC1. RanBP3 increased the dissociation rate constant (koff) for both [α-32P]GDP and [α-32P]GTP, although the effect for GDP appeared more robust. Furthermore, RanBP3 enhanced exchange of [α-32P]GDP for unlabeled GDP (data not shown). Because RanBP3 cannot bind directly to Ran·GDP (Fig. 1 B), these data cannot be explained by product sequestration. Furthermore, RanBP1, a protein that has been reported to inhibit RCC1-catalyzed exchange (24Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), potently inhibited RCC1 within the assay. Thus, although RanBP1 and RanBP3 have similar RBDs, these data indicate that the two RBDs possess distinct biochemical activities (see “Discussion”). Recently histones H2A/H2B have been shown to bind directly to RCC1 and stimulate its catalytic activity (7Nemergut M.E. Mizzen C.A. Stukenberg T. Allis C.D. Macara I.G. Science. 2001; 292: 1540-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Unlike the histone-RCC1 interaction, the interaction between RCC1 and RanBP3 is Ran-stimulated. This difference suggested that the surfaces on RCC1 that are recognized by RanBP3 and H2A/H2B may be distinct, and as such, the effects of these proteins on enhancing nucleotide exchange may be additive. To test this hypothesis directly, we titrated the effect of RanBP3 on RCC1-catalyzed nucleotide exchange in the presence and absence of a saturating amount of histones H2A/H2B (Fig. 2 D). The histones stimulated RCC1 activity at all concentrations of RanBP3, demonstrating that RanBP3 and H2A/H2B have additive effects on RCC1. RanBP3 has been shown to enhance Crm1-dependent nuclear export (15Lindsay M.E. Holaska J.M. Welch K. Paschal B.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Englmeier L. Fornerod M. Bischoff F.R. Petosa C. Mattaj I.W. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 926-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). RanBP3 binds directly to Crm1 and enhances the affinity of Crm1 for both Ran·GTP and cargo. Therefore, since RCC1 can bind RanBP3, it seemed possible that RCC1 might also interact with Crm1 in a RanBP3-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis directly, GST-RCC1 was immobilized to beads and incubated with Crm1 in the presence or absence of Ran and RanBP3. In the absence of these proteins, only background levels of Crm1 were bound to RCC1 (Fig. 3 A). Ran bound RCC1; however, it did not facilitate binding of Crm1. RanBP3 associated with RCC1 in a Ran-stimulated manner (Fig. 1 C). Only when Crm1, RanBP3, and Ran were added could Crm1 associate with RCC1 (Fig. 3 A). Thus, Crm1 is able to bind RCC1 in a Ran-stimulated and RanBP3-dependent manner, indicating that RCC1, Ran, RanBP3, and Crm1 are able to form a quaternary complex. Interestingly, although both Ran·GTP and Ran·GDP were able to stimulate binding of Crm1 to RCC1 in the presence of RanBP3, Ran·GDP appeared more efficient at recruiting Crm1 to RCC1 (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that the Crm1-RanBP3 complex can more efficiently recognize Ran·GDP bound to RCC1 than Ran·GTP. Importantly, when added to exchange assays, Crm1 did not alter the ability of RanBP3 to stimulate RCC1 (Fig. 3 C). RanBP3 is a cofactor for Crm1-dependent nuclear export (15Lindsay M.E. Holaska J.M. Welch K. Paschal B.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and functions by increasing the affinity of Crm1 for both Ran·GTP and cargo. In the absence of Ran and cargo, RanBP3 also inhibits Crm1 from interacting with the NPC, thereby reducing futile cycles of transport. We now find that RanBP3 possesses an independent activity that is mediated through the interaction of the Crm1-RanBP3 complex with RCC1. Crm1-RanBP3 can form a Ran-dependent complex with RCC1. Although Ran is required to recruit RanBP3-Crm1 to RCC1, both Ran·GDP and Ran·GTP are able to facilitate this process. Furthermore, in the presence of the RanBP3-Crm1 complex, the enzymatic activity of RCC1 toward Ran is stimulated. Based on these data, we propose that nuclear RanBP3 acts as a scaffold protein to facilitate efficient loading of Ran·GTP and cargo onto Crm1. RanBP3 functions by binding directly to Crm1. Although the binary Crm1-RanBP3 complex is able to bind both Ran·GTP and cargo (15Lindsay M.E. Holaska J.M. Welch K. Paschal B.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it has been predicted that ∼80% of free nuclear Ran is GDP-bound (32Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and cannot facilitate binding of Crm1-RanBP3 to cargo. In contrast, Ran·GDP can recruit Crm1-RanBP3 to RCC1. This recruitment stimulates the catalytic activity of RCC1, thereby promoting rapid loading of GTP. Conversion of Ran·GDP to Ran·GTP within the Crm1-RanBP3-Ran-RCC1 complex would promote export cargo binding to the Crm1. Release of the Crm1-RanBP3-Ran·GTP-export cargo complex from RCC1 may require additional cellular factors since in vitro binding of cargo is not sufficient to promote disassembly (data not shown). Alternatively no allosteric release mechanism may be necessary if the dissociation rate constant is sufficiently high. Although neither Crm1, RanBP3, nor the Crm1-RanBP3 complex can detectably bind Ran·GDP (Fig. 1 B, data not shown), both RanBP3 and Crm1-RanBP3 can be recruited to RCC1 by Ran·GDP (Figs. 1and 3). These data demonstrate that RCC1 can remodel the structure of Ran·GDP such that it can be recognized by the Crm1-RanBP3 complex. Also, although RanBP3 possesses a RBD similar to that of RanBP1 (20Mueller L. Cordes V.C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), RanBP3 possesses a low affinity for Ran·GTP relative to RanBP1, and while RanBP3 stimulates nucleotide exchange by RCC1, RanBP1 is inhibitory (Fig. 1 C) (24Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, it has been noted that critical residues for Ran binding within the RBD from RanBP1 are not present in RanBP3 (25Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R436-R439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The residues on Ran involved in the GTP/GDP switch may provide the basis for the Ran·GTP-specific binding of RanBP1. Their absence in RanBP3 may account for the ability of RanBP3 to bind Ran·GDP in the presence of RCC1. We note that Nup2p, another protein with a RanBP1-like RBD, also does not inhibit RCC1 (26Denning D. Mykytka B. Allen N.P. Huang L., Al, B. Rexach M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Together these data demonstrate that, while the RBDs from RanBP1 and RanBP3 are similar, they harbor distinct biochemical activities. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of RanBP1 on RCC1 is not intrinsic to all proteins possessing a RanBP1-like RBD (see below). Solution of the three-dimensional crystal structure of the RCC1-Ran complex has provided insight into the enzymatic mechanism of RCC1 (27Renault L. Kuhlmann J. Henkel A. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2001; 105: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). One interesting aspect of the structure is that the C terminus of Ran appears to be deployed, suggesting that RCC1 can activate this conformational switch in Ran. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that RCC1 can enhance nucleotide exchange on a mutant Ran lacking its C-terminal acidic tail (RanΔ211DEDDDL) more rapidly than on wild-type Ran (19Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We suspected that RanBP3 might stimulate exchange by facilitating the C-terminal switch. However, this mechanism is unlikely because RanBP3 is capable of stimulating RCC1-mediated exchange even on RanΔ211DEDDDL (data not shown). Although RCC1 is an essential protein for nuclear transport, it is also essential for nuclear envelope assembly and mitotic spindle formation (28Dasso M. Cell. 2001; 104: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Moore J.D. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 77-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sazer S. Dasso M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1111-1118PubMed Google Scholar). By binding to chromatin, it is believed that RCC1 creates a high concentration of Ran·GTP at the chromatin surface. Interestingly binding of RCC1 to histones H2A/H2B enhances the catalytic activity of RCC1, and RanBP3 can further amplify the effect of histones. Thus, RanBP3 may possess a role in cell cycle progression and nuclear envelope biogenesis. The yeast homologue of RanBP3, Yrb2p, has been implicated in cell cycle progression since disruption of YRB2 results in prolongation of mitosis (31Noguchi E. Saitoh Y. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, a potential role for RanBP3 in the mammalian cell cycle is worthy of future research. We thank L. Gerace for providing the anti-Crm1 serum, D. Görlich for the Ran(Q69L) cDNA, and T. Nishimoto for the RCC1 cDNA. We thank all members of the Macara laboratory for help during all phases of this study."
https://openalex.org/W1977308235,"Shot noise measurements have been used to measure the charge of quasiparticles in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) regime1,2,3. To induce shot noise in an otherwise noiseless current of quasiparticles, a barrier is placed in its path to cause weak backscattering. The measured shot noise is proportional to the charge of the quasiparticles; for example, at filling factor v=1/3, noise corresponding to q=e/3 appears. For increasingly opaque barriers, the measured charge increases monotonically, approaching q=e asymptotically4,5. It was therefore believed that only electrons, or alternatively, three bunched quasiparticles, can tunnel through high-potential barriers encountered by a noiseless current of quasiparticles. Here we investigate the interaction of e/3 quasiparticles with a strong barrier in FQH samples and find that bunching of quasiparticles in the strong backscattering limit depends on the average dilution of the quasiparticle current. For a very dilute current, bunching ceases altogether and the transferred charge approaches q=e/3. This surprising result demonstrates that quasiparticles can tunnel individually through high-potential barriers originally thought to be opaque for them."

The role of inositol phosphates in signaling pathways involved in these changes in gene expression was examined by overexpressing inositol phosphate-metabolizing enzymes and determining effects on ANP, MLC, and 45 S ribosomal gene expression following co-transfection of appropriate reporter gene constructs. Overexpression of enzymes that metabolize inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate did not reduce ANP or MLC responses, but overexpression of the enzyme primarily responsible for metabolism of inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2), inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (INPP), reduced ANP and MLC responses associated with α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated hypertrophy. Similarly overexpressed INPP reduced ANP and MLC responses associated with contraction-induced hypertrophy. In addition, overexpression of INPP reduced the increase in ribosomal DNA transcription associated with both hypertrophic models. Hypertrophied cells from both cell models as well as ventricular tissue from mouse hearts hypertrophied by pressure overload in vivo contained heightened levels of Ins(1,4)P2, suggesting reduced INPP activity in three different models of hypertrophy.

Circulation. 1998; 97: 1890-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Such hypertrophic growth in the in vivo situation is initially advantageous in allowing the heart to compensate for such factors as loss of myocytes or increased aortic pressure. However, sustained hypertrophy eventually leads to the development of heart failure, currently a leading cause of death in western societies (2Lorell B. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3824-3827PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, the mechanisms involved in regulating hypertrophic growth are the subject of intense investigation. Signaling pathways involved in cardiac hypertrophic growth appear to be similar to those that mediate growth and division in other cell types (3Bogoyevitch M. Sugden P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy can be initiated by cytokines, growth factors, or factors that activate G protein-coupled receptors, principally those that activate the Gq class of heterotrimeric G proteins (1Homcy C.J. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1890-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activation of Gq either following receptor activation or directly by the use of constitutively active Gqα mutants leads to hypertrophic responses involving mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as well as monomeric G proteins, although the details of all the intermediates are not fully understood (4Dorn G.W. Brown J.H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Currently the only well established substrates for activated Gqα are the isoforms of PLC-β1 (5Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), thus activation of Gq would be expected to lead tosn-1,2-diacylglycerol generation and protein kinase C (PKC) activation as well as Ins(1,4,5)P3 production and increases in cytosolic Ca2+. While activation of PKC can initiate hypertrophic responses, PKC does not appear to be solely responsible for all aspects of Gq-initiated hypertrophic responses (6Adams J.W. Sah V.P. Henderson S.A. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,7Wu G.Y. Toyokawa T. Hahn H. Dorn G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29927-29930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), implying a role for the inositol phosphate (InsP) arm of the pathway. Recent studies have identified mechanisms whereby raised cytosolic Ca2+ could lead to hypertrophic responses via the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin or possibly via pathways initiated by calmodulin-activated kinase IV (8Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R.

However, Ins(1,4,5)P3 has little effect on global Ca2+ levels in myocardial preparations, and such effects would need to be considered against the large increases and decreases in cytosolic Ca2+ that occur during each beat in contracting myocytes. There is no evidence that Ins(1,4,5)P3 can cause sustained increases in diastolic Ca2+ levels as would be required for calcineurin or calmodulin-activated kinase mechanisms (11Kentish J.C.

We have previously presented evidence that activation of Gq-coupled receptors in cardiomyocytes leads to an InsP response that involves principally the generation of Ins(1,4)P2 from PtdIns(4)P independently of any Ins(1,4,5)P3 production (13Woodcock E.

Such a mechanism might serve to reduce the generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 because that is potentially arrhythmogenic (12Lipp P. Laine M. Tovey S.C. Burrell K.M. Berridge M.J., Li, W. Bootman M.D. Curr.

However, it is also possible that products of these Ins(1,4)P2-generating pathways have a functional significance of their own. In the current paper we present evidence that inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (INPP), the enzyme primarily responsible for metabolism of Ins(1,4)P2, reduces hypertrophic responses in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. This is the first report of a functional importance of Ins(1,4)P2 in cardiac signaling pathways. Neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs) were isolated from 1–3-day-old rats and maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin and 10 μg/ml transferrin exactly as described previously (18Autelitano D.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1515-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 0.1 mm) was included for the first 3 days. INPP was cloned from a human heart cDNA library (Stratagene) by PCR using primers corresponding to positions 1–22 and 1177–2000, sense and antisense, respectively, of the published human INPP cDNA sequence (19York J.D. Veile R.A. Doniskeller H. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5833-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The 5′-primer contained an additional 24 nucleotides coding for the FLAG epitope (Sigma) inserted in-frame between the start ATG and the second codon. The PCR product was ligated into the pCR3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) resulting in the construct pCR3.1-FLAG-INPP that drives expression of FLAG-tagged INPP (sense orientation) under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Plasmids containing full-length antisense inserts were also selected. Orientation of the INPP insert was determined by sequencing and endonuclease mapping. The atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-luciferase plasmid (pANP(−638)LΔ5′), the myosin light chain-2 (MLC)-luciferase plasmid (pMLC(−250)LΔ5′), the AP-1-luciferase plasmid (TRE2PRL(−36)), the CMV-β-galactosidase, and the reporter construct for ribosomal gene transcription, pSMECAT, have been described previously (20Shubeita H.

The pCR3.1 vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene or the β-galactosidase gene was used as control in experiments involving INPP. The expression plasmid encoding the type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (22Laxminarayan K.M. Chan B.K. Tetaz T. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17305-17310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Prof. Christina Mitchell (Monash University). The plasmid encoding the A isoform of Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was obtained from Dr. Christophe Erneux (Free University of Brussels, Belgium). Plasmids encoding constitutively active JNK-1 and c-Jun were obtained from Dr. N. Dhanasekaran (Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA), and the plasmid expressing the AT-1A receptor was supplied by Dr. Walter Thomas (Baker Institute). Samples containing 30 μg of protein were separated electrophoretically on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions and were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) at a dilution of 1 in 2000 or polyclonal anti-rabbit antiserum against INPP at a dilution of 1 in 5000 followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad). Detection was achieved using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The molecular sizes of the immunodetected proteins were verified by comparison to the migration of prestained protein markers (Bio-Rad) electrophoresed in parallel. The entire coding region of the INPP cDNA was amplified using primers that introduced a His6leader after the ATG and then cloned into the inducible bacterial expression vector pET17b (Novagen). Positive clones were verified by sequencing. Recombinant protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified using Ni2+ affinity resins as recommended by the supplier (Qiagen). The purified protein was used to generate antisera in rabbits, and the sera were purified as described elsewhere (23Skinner M.P. Lucas C.M. Burns G.F. Chesterman C.N. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant INPP was confirmed by Western analysis and enzyme assays on transfected cells. CHO cells transfected with pCR3.1-FLAG-INPP (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen) expressed a protein of molecular mass 47 kDa recognized by anti-FLAG antibody that was not observed in cells transfected with pCR3.1-CAT, a construct that expresses the non-mammalian protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Fig.1 A). The identity of the immunoreactive protein as INPP was further verified by blotting with affinity purified anti-INPP antibody that also identified an immunoreactive protein of a size consistent with the molecular mass predicted from the amino acid sequence of INPP. The expression of this protein was increased by transfection with pCR3.1-FLAG-INPP. Transfection of CHO cells with pCR3.1-FLAG-INPP also increased INPP activity, which was measured as previously described (24Inhorn R.C. Bansal V.S. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2170-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). To ensure that overexpression of INPP perturbed InsP metabolism, we transfected HEK-293 cells with Rc/CMV-AT-1Ato overexpress AT-1A receptors as well as with pCR3.1-FLAG-INPP or vector control. Cells were subsequently labeled with [3H]inositol (20 μCi/ml) for 24 h and then stimulated for 20 min with angiotensin II (1 μm) in the presence of LiCl (10 mm). [3H]InsPs were extracted and quantified by HPLC as described below. Overexpression of INPP caused a selective decrease in Ins(1,4)P2 (Fig.1 B). Thus, transfection with pCR3.1-FLAG-INPP causes increased expression of active INPP that leads to reduced Ins(1,4)P2 content. For phenylephrine (PE)-induced hypertrophy, NCMs were plated at 400 cells/mm2 on 35-mm wells and treated with 50 μm PE and 1 μmpropranolol for 40 h. Control cells were treated with propranolol only. Under these conditions cardiomyocytes do not spontaneously contract. For contraction-induced hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes where plated at 1600 cells/mm2. Under these conditions cardiomyocytes spontaneously contract and undergo hypertrophic growth compared with non-contracting cells (25Kent R.L. McDermott P.J. Circ.

Hypertrophy in contraction-arrested cells was initiated by reducing the level of KCl in the medium from 50 to 5 mm. Spontaneous contraction occurred within 1 h of the reduction in KCl.

For producing pressure overload hypertrophy, mice (F1 crosses of C57/SJL strains) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (8 mg/100 g), xylazine (2 mg/100 g), atropine (0.6 mg/100 g), and carprofen (0.5 mg/100 g). The chest was opened along the midline of the upper sternum. The segment of aortic arch between the right innominate and the left main carotid arteries was dissected, and the aortic diameter was narrowed by 70% (28Wang B.H., Du, X.J. Autelitano D.J. Milano C.A. Woodcock E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1079-H1086PubMed Google Scholar). Sham-operated animals underwent a similar operation except that the aortic arch was not constricted. All experiments were carried out 6 weeks after surgery when hypertrophy was well established (28Wang B.H., Du, X.J. Autelitano D.J. Milano C.A. Woodcock E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1079-H1086PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate using cardiomyocytes on 35-mm wells 1 day after isolation. Transient transfection using a total of 4.8 μg of DNA/well was performed by the calcium phosphate method. As described elsewhere, this results in transfection efficiency between 1 and 2% (29Shubeita H.E. Martinson E.A. Vanbilsen M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested into Lysis Buffer containing 0.1 mK2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.9 (luciferase assays) or 0.25 mTris-Cl, pH 8.0 (CAT assays). Luciferase activity was measured in 100 mm Tricine, 10 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 75 μmluciferin, pH 7.8 for 2 min in a Lumat LB9507 Luminometer. CAT activity in cell extracts was measured by the synthesis of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol, analyzed by TLC as described previously (30Hannan R. Stefanovsky V. Arino T. Rothblum L. Moss T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and quantified using a Fujix BAS 1000 phosphorimaging system. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (0.25 mm) as substrate and determining absorbance at 410 nm. Protein concentration was assayed using the Bradford method. To control for any differences in transfection efficiency, data were expressed as luciferase activity relative to the activity of β-galactosidase co-expressed under a CMV promoter. NCMs on 35-mm wells were labeled with [3H]inositol (15 μCi/ml) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and BrdUrd for 48 h. Cells were then washed with non-radioactive medium and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μm propranolol and 10 mm LiCl for 10 min prior to addition of 100 μm norepinephrine (NE) for 20 min. [3H]InsPs were extracted using 5% trichloroacetic acid, 5 mm phytic acid, 2.5 mm EDTA and centrifuged, and the supernatant was extracted with 0.75 volumes of trichloroethane:tri-N-octylamine (1:1, v/v) as described previously (31Arthur J.F. Matkovich S.J. Mitchell C.J. Biden T.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37341-37346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Aqueous phases were treated with proteinase K (2.5 μg/ml), passed through Dowex-50 columns, and lyophilized. [3H]InsPs were separated using anion exchange HPLC and quantified using an on-line β-counter as described previously (32Lin F. Owens W. Chen S. Stevens M. Kesteven S. Arthur J. Woodcock E. Feneley M. Graham R. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mouse left ventricle strips (15–20 mg of tissue) were mounted in 3-ml organ baths in Hepes-buffered Krebs' medium and labeled with [3H]inositol (20 μCi/ml) as described previously (28Wang B.H., Du, X.J. Autelitano D.J. Milano C.A. Woodcock E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1079-H1086PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled strips were stimulated with 100 μm NE in the presence of propranolol and LiCl for 20 min followed by rapid freezing in liquid N2. [3H]InsPs were extracted and quantified as described above. Differences between treatment groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons and accepted as statistically significant at a family error rate of p < 0.05 (individual pairwise comparisons were significant at p < 0.02). Unless otherwise noted, results shown are from representative experiments performed in triplicate that were repeated in independent NCM preparations at least three times. Fetal calf serum specially selected for low endotoxin was obtained from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Parkville, Australia. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Hepes, and other materials for the preparation of cell culture solutions and media were cell culture grade, obtained from Sigma, and dissolved in milliQ H2O. Norepinephrine bitartrate and phenylephrine were purchased from Sigma. [3H]Inositol (18.00 Ci/mmol) was obtained from AmershamBiosciences. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma or BDH/AnalaR and were of analytical reagent grade. NCMs were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Gqα wild type (WT) or Gqα mutants together with the reporter gene ANP-luciferase as a measure of hypertrophic signaling and CMV-β-galactosidase to control for transfection efficiency. 20 h after transfection, PE (50 μm) was added for a further 40 h. Cells were harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. PE caused a substantial increase in ANP expression as indicated by luciferase activity in transfected cells (Fig. 2). As reported previously, the PE response was increased by overexpression of Gqα-WT, while basal activity was not altered (29Shubeita H.E. Martinson E.A. Vanbilsen M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Expression of the constitutively active mutant Gqα(Q209L) increased ANP expression, and there was no further increase with added PE. In marked contrast, Gqα(Q209L) with alanine substitutions D243A, N244E, and E245A (QL,DNE) rendering it unable to stimulate PLC (33Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) had no detectable effect on ANP responses in the presence or absence of PE. Thus both Gq and PLC appear to be involved in mediating ANP responses to PE in cardiomyocytes. PLC activation generates two partially independent signaling pathways, one initiated by sn-1,2-diacylglycerol generation and activation of various isoforms of PKC and the other initiated by Ins(1,4,5)P3 and inositol phosphate metabolites. To examine the contribution of PKCs to PE-induced hypertrophic signaling, cells were treated with the selective PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (1 μm). Isolated NCMs were transfected with ANP- or MLC-luciferase constructs and subsequently treated with PE (50 μm) with or without bisindolylmaleimide (1 μm). As shown in Fig.3, inhibition of PKCs with bisindolylmaleimide did not significantly reduce signaling from PE to either ANP or MLC reporter genes. However, expression of both ANP- and MLC-luciferase was increased by direct activation of PKCs by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 10 μm), although the stimulation was less than with PE, and bisindolylmaleimide (1 μm) was inhibitory. The inactive isomer of bisindolylmaleimide, bisindolylmaleimide 5, was ineffective in reducing the PMA response, attesting to the specificity of the inhibition (Fig.3). Another series of experiments was performed using a reporter construct encoding AP-1 response elements (2XTRE-luciferase) (34Trejo J. Chambard J.C. Karin M. Brown J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4742-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both PE (50 μm) and PMA (10 μm) increased AP-1 activity as indicated by increased luciferase activity, although in contrast to the ANP and MLC responses, PE was relatively weak compared with PMA. Responses to both effectors were inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide (1 μm) (Fig. 3). Thus, PE-stimulated activation of AP-1 response elements requires PKC activity, whereas transcriptional activation of ANP and MLC by PE is PKC-independent in this model (35Morissette M.R. Sah V.P. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1769-H1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of a requirement for PLC activity without PKC involvement suggests a role for the other arm of the PLC response, the inositol phosphates. To investigate the possible role of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the signaling pathways that link α1-adrenergic receptor activation to increased expression of ANP and MLC, Ins(1,4,5)P3-metabolizing enzymes were overexpressed, and responses to PE were evaluated. Pathways involved in the metabolism of Ins(1,4,5)P3 are shown in Fig. 4. Overexpression of the enzyme that phosphorylates Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase (Fig. 4, enzyme 1), did not cause any change in ANP or MLC expression in the presence or absence of PE (Fig. 5, left panels). This argues against a major role for Ins(1,4,5)P3 or InsPs derived from Ins(1,3,4,5)P3, including Ins(1,3,4)P3, and its metabolites. Overexpression of an enzyme that dephosphorylates Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,4)P2, the 43-kDa type 1 Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (Fig. 4, enzyme 2), on the other hand, increased PE-stimulated responses (Fig. 5,right panels). The finding that increased dephosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 actually stimulated ANP and MLC responses could be interpreted as either Ins(1,4,5)P3 or the alternative substrate Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 being inhibitory. However, the lack of effect of overexpression of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase, which reduces Ins(1,4,5)P3 while increasing Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, argues against both possibilities.Figure 5ANP and MLC responses to PE are not reduced by increased metabolism of Ins (1,4,5)P3. NCMs were transfected with ANP- (upper panels) or MLC-luciferase (lower panels) together with plasmids encoding Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase (IP3kinase) or Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (IP3Pase) as indicated. PE (50 μm) was added, and luciferase activity was measured after 40 h. Values shown are luminometer units per unit of β-galactosidase activity, mean ± S.E. of triplicate estimations. The experiment was performed three times with similar results.

To test this possibility, cardiomyocytes were transfected with the enzyme that dephosphorylates Ins(1,4)P2 to Ins(4)P1, INPP (Fig. 4, enzyme 3), together with ANP-luciferase or MLC-luciferase constructs. Overexpression of INPP inhibited both ANP and MLC responses to PE in a dose-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 6 A. To examine the specificity of the observed inhibitory effect of INPP, transcription from ANP and MLC promoters was stimulated by overexpressing constitutively active JNK-1 together with c-Jun. Increased transcription was not inhibited by INPP. This shows that the inhibitory action of INPP targets upstream signaling pathways involved in the hypertrophic response and that INPP overexpression is not generally toxic to the cells. To further establish the specificity of the effect of INPP on hypertrophic signaling, we transfected NCMs with full-length antisense INPP and examined effects on ANP responses to 50 μm PE. Antisense INPP reduced INPP content in CHO cells and increased ANP transcription in the presence and absence of PE, providing further evidence that activity of this enzyme can regulate signaling pathways culminating in ANP transcription (Fig.6 B). To further examine possible cytotoxic effects of INPP overexpression, we transfected NCMs with pCR3.1-FLAG-INPP together with pEGFP-Cl so that transfected cells could be identified by EGFP fluorescence.

Although the specific needs of an intracellular organelle caused massive adaptations of the mitochondria over this time period, mitochondria still resemble their prokaryotic ancestors in many respects. About half of the mitochondrial proteome shows significant homology to bacterial proteins (1Karlberg O. Canback B. Kurland C.G. Andersson S.G. Yeast. 2000; 17: 170-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these conserved proteins fulfill housekeeping functions, such as energy metabolism, DNA replication, or protein synthesis. During evolution, regulatory or accessory components were added together with proteins that mediate the exchange of metabolites and polypeptides with the hosting cell. Upon transition from endocellular bacteria to organelles, most genes were transferred to the nuclear genome. As a consequence, these proteins have to be imported into mitochondria following synthesis in the cytosol and directed to their respective subcompartment: the outer membrane, the intermembrane space (IMS),1 the inner membrane, or the matrix.Proteins destined for the matrix typically carry N-terminal extensions, called presequences, which are proteolytically removed in the matrix following translocation. Presequences have the potential to form amphipathic helices with one face being positively charged and the other being hydrophobic. Import of these proteins is achieved by the translocase in the outer membrane, the TOM complex, and a translocase of the inner membrane, the TIM23 complex (for a review, see Refs. 2Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar and 3Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Curr. Opin.

This was referred to as stop-transfer pathway, and all substrates identified so far are monotopic proteins. Either these proteins carry typical presequences that direct the N terminus into the matrix (6Rojo E.E. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8040-8047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or alternatively, amphipathic helices directly C-terminal to transmembrane domains can function as internal signals that allow import and membrane insertion of loop-like protein structures. Upon arrest of the transmembrane domain in the inner membrane, these proteins acquire an Nout-Cintopology in the membrane (7Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).A second group of inner membrane proteins is inserted from the mitochondrial matrix. These proteins carry presequences that direct them across both mitochondrial membranes. Because protein integration occurs in the same direction as in bacteria, this route was called the conservative sorting pathway (8Hartl F.U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Examples are both monotopic proteins (9Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The insertion of the few examples studied so far was found to depend on the function of Oxa1 (12Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Oxa1 belongs to a ubiquitous protein family that is involved in protein insertion processes into membranes of bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (for a review, see Ref.13Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, a second component, Mba1, that cooperates with Oxa1 in this process (14Preuss M. Leonhard K. Hell K. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was identified in yeast mitochondria. Obviously, membrane proteins synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes also have to be inserted from the matrix. The membrane integration of several, but not all, of these proteins also depends on Oxa1 and Mba1 function (14Preuss M. Leonhard K. Hell K. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Ii M. Mihara K. J. Biol.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).A third class of inner membrane proteins is inserted by a second TIM translocase, the TIM22 complex (19Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Kerscher O. Holder J. Srinivasan M. Leung R.S. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1663-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Substrates of this pathway are members of the solute carrier family and components of the TIM complexes, all proteins for which bacterial homologues were not found. In contrast to the proteins sorted by the two former pathways, TIM22 substrates do not contain amphipathic targeting sequences but instead contain more complex internal signals.Very little is known about the insertion pathways of polytopic inner membrane proteins of prokaryotic origin. Oxa1 is the only example whose import pathway has been studied in some detail (11Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It was suggested that proteins with two membrane-spanning domains of Nin-Cin topology might be integrated into the inner membrane from the IMS side (21Arnold I. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1469-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, a series of import and stop-transfer signals in polytopic proteins might initiate and halt their translocation into mitochondria at the level of the inner membrane, thereby inserting transmembrane domains from the intermembrane space. Thus, bitopic proteins should contain two independent signals: a presequence inserting the N terminus and a loop-forming segment inserting the C terminus of the protein. Such a situation was found for cytochrome c1, which is proteolytically cleaved in the IMS following insertion into the inner membrane resulting in a monotopic Nout-Cintopology (21Arnold I. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1469-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).In this study, we analyzed the insertion pathways of two bitopic proteins, Mrs2 and Yta10. Both of them have close relatives in bacteria. Mrs2 is a Mg2+ transporter that exposes only eight amino acid residues into the IMS (22Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. J. Bio. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Yta10 is an inner membrane protease containing a more complex IMS loop of 89 amino acid residues. Both proteins were found to be first completely imported into the matrix, where they form soluble intermediates that are subsequently integrated into the inner membrane. The efficiency of the membrane insertion of both proteins was influenced by the membrane potential; however, translocation of the longer IMS loop of Yta10 was significantly more dependent on the energetic state of the inner membrane.DISCUSSIONWe have analyzed the intramitochondrial sorting of two bitopic inner membrane proteins: Mrs2, which exposes a short loop of eight residues into the IMS, and Yta10, which contains a much larger IMS loop of 89 residues. Both proteins are synthesized in the cytosol with N-terminal mitochondrial presequences mediating their import into the mitochondrial matrix. We found for both Mrs2 and Yta10 a transient accumulation of the sorting intermediates in the matrix. After longer import periods, the levels of these intermediates declined, and instead, membrane-embedded species appeared. This indicates that the sorting of both bitopic inner membrane proteins can be subdivided into two sequential reactions: (i) import into the matrix and (ii) the insertion of transmembrane segments into and translocation of IMS domains across the inner membrane. Thus, both proteins follow a conservative sorting pathway in which the integration into the inner membrane occurs in the same direction as in bacteria. This is in contrast to what was proposed before, which is an insertion mode from the IMS of bitopic proteins mediated by internal signals (21Arnold I. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1469-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).A conservative sorting mode of precursors of inner membrane proteins has important implications on the evolution of mitochondrial proteins from bacterial ancestors. The addition of a mitochondrial import signal onto the N terminus of the proteins is the only prerequisite for correct protein sorting after gene transfer to the nucleus. This notion is supported by the observation that the fusion of a mitochondrial targeting signal onto CorA, the bacterial homologue of Mrs2, led to proper sorting and function in eukaryotic cells (22Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. J. Bio. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this case, the insertion machinery inherited from bacteria could be used and gradually adapted to the specific needs of an intracellular organelle. In contrast, an insertion mode from the IMS would have required the development of additional internal insertion signals within each sorted polypeptide and the addition of specific components facilitating membrane integration and translocation of matrix domains.What are the components that mediate translocation of loop domains across the inner membrane? It was shown that the inner membrane protein Oxa1 is required for efficient export into the IMS of the N-terminal domain of the mitochondrially encoded Cox2 protein (10Herrmann J.M. Koll H. Cook R.A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27079-27086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as well as of conservatively sorted proteins (9Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In contrast, the export of loop domains of mitochondrial translation products occurs even in the absence of Oxa1, albeit with reduced efficiency (17Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that the function of Oxa1 is dispensable for membrane insertion of the loop domains of Mrs2 and Yta10. Thus, either Oxa1 seems not to be involved in the translocation of loops, or other components functionally overlap with Oxa1 and can take over its function. On the other hand, we cannot completely exclude that in the temperature-sensitive oxa1 strain, Oxa1 is still able to fulfill a role in the insertion of loop domains but is defective for the insertion of N termini.What are the components that mediate Oxa1-independent membrane insertion? It was recently reported that the inner membrane protein Mba1 plays an important role in the Oxa1-independent insertion of mitochondrially encoded proteins (14Preuss M. Leonhard K. Hell K. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, Mrs2 was found to insert in the absence of both Oxa1 and Mba1, and similar steady state levels of Yta10 were found in wild type and Δoxa1 Δmba1mitochondria (not shown). Similarly, in chloroplasts, integration of the bitopic proteins PsbW and PsbX into the thylakoid membrane was found to occur independently of any known translocation component including the plastidal Oxa1 homologue Alb3 (35Woolhead C.A. Thompson S.J. Moore M. Tissier C. Mant A. Rodger A. Henry R. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40841-40846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both PsbW and PsbX, like Mrs2, comtain two transmembrane segments separated by rather short loops of overall negative charge. In Escherichia coli, the bitopic protein M13 Procoat was shown to partition into the membrane in the absence of the Oxa1 homologue YidC, whereas complete membrane translocation of its periplasmic loop required YidC (36Samuelson J.C. Jiang F., Yi, L. Chen M. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A “spontaneous” insertion into the inner membrane of proteins such as Mrs2 cannot be excluded, although the well ordered nature of biological membranes makes a simple phase separation process of hydrophobic protein stretches into the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer unlikely. It is conceivable that the lipid packaging of the membranes has to be somehow disturbed, for example by integrated transmembrane domains of proteins that might serve as entry sites. Accordingly, membrane insertion might not require bona fideprotein translocases but still might have to be assisted by proteinous components. This proposal receives support by the observation that the expression of proteins that are destabilized in the membrane due to the presence of positively charged residues in transmembrane segments relieves the requirement for Oxa1 (37Saint-Georges Y. Hamel P. Lemaire C. Dujardin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13814-13819Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Which energy source provides the driving force for the translocation of loops into the IMS? It has been suggested for bacterial inner membrane proteins that membrane insertion is mainly driven by an electrophoretic effect that allows the vectorial movement of negatively charged loops to the positively charged periplasmic face of the membrane (38Schuenemann T.A. Delgado-Nixon V.M. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6855-6864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This effect might also be the basis for the “positive-inside” rule according to which the charge distribution on both sides of transmembrane domains specifies their orientation. This appears to apply to both bacterial and mitochondrial proteins (39Andersson H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 40Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 41Rojo E.E. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19617-19622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The loops facing the IMS of both Mrs2 and Yta10 are negatively charged (cf. Figs. 1 and 6), and an electrophoretic effect might therefore serve as a driving force for their membrane translocation. In agreement with this assumption, we observed a reduced insertion efficiency at lower energization of mitochondria. The dependence on the membrane potential was by far more pronounced with Yta10, suggesting that larger and more complex loops need a higher membrane potential. We were, however, not able to study the membrane potential dependence of the insertion process in more detail because this reaction could not be experimentally discriminated from the process of mitochondrial import.Is the insertion of negatively charged loops from the matrix a general principle in the biogenesis of inner membrane proteins, or are Mrs2 and Yta10 exceptions? If a conservative pathway is the typical sorting route for inner membrane proteins that are sorted via the TIM23 translocase, IMS loops of these proteins would be predicted to be generally acidic. As shown in Fig. 8, IMS loops of multispanning proteins that are synthesized with an N-terminal presequence consistently show a strong bias toward negative charges (upper row). In contrast, no charge preference was found for IMS loops of inner membrane proteins that are sorted via the TIM22 pathway (lower row). This suggests that the insertion of IMS loops from the matrix is a general principle in the topogenesis of polytopic inner membrane proteins of mitochondria.Although Mrs2 was found to be sorted in a conservative manner, it contains an internal import signal that is able to promote the insertion of the C terminus from the IMS into the matrix. This signal was dispensable for the sorting and function of Mrs2 both in vivo and in vitro. We still cannot exclude that a minor fraction of the Mrs2 precursor might be arrested in the inner membrane upon import and that the internal signal might serve as a substitute that ensures a correct topology of a missorted species. This situation of a precursor that has the potential to insert into the inner membrane both from the matrix and from the IMS might represent an evolutionary transition state. It seems conceivable that during evolution, pathways were established such as that described for cytochromec1 (21Arnold I. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1469-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which was reported to insert into the inner membrane from the IMS.In conclusion, mitochondrial polytopic inner membrane proteins can be subdivided into two groups: proteins that were newly added to the organellar proteome such as carriers and transporters that mediate the exchange of components with the cytosol. These proteins developed internal signals and are inserted from the IMS by a specialized inner membrane translocase, the TIM22 complex. In contrast, proteins that originate from bacterial ancestors obtained a presequence that enabled their targeting to the matrix from where they inserted into the inner membrane on a pathway that existed in bacteria. The biogenesis of these inner membrane proteins is surprisingly similar to that of bacterial proteins, and their membrane integration appears to adhere to the same principles such as the positive-inside rule and the translocation of negatively charged domains by an electrophoretic effect. The identification and characterization of components that assist this membrane integration process will be a major goal in the future. The phylogenetic separation of mitochondria and bacteria took place about 1.5–2 billion years ago. Although the specific needs of an intracellular organelle caused massive adaptations of the mitochondria over this time period, mitochondria still resemble their prokaryotic ancestors in many respects. About half of the mitochondrial proteome shows significant homology to bacterial proteins (1Karlberg O. Canback B. Kurland C.G. Andersson S.G. Yeast. 2000; 17: 170-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these conserved proteins fulfill housekeeping functions, such as energy metabolism, DNA replication, or protein synthesis. During evolution, regulatory or accessory components were added together with proteins that mediate the exchange of metabolites and polypeptides with the hosting cell. Upon transition from endocellular bacteria to organelles, most genes were transferred to the nuclear genome. As a consequence, these proteins have to be imported into mitochondria following synthesis in the cytosol and directed to their respective subcompartment: the outer membrane, the intermembrane space (IMS),1 the inner membrane, or the matrix. Proteins destined for the matrix typically carry N-terminal extensions, called presequences, which are proteolytically removed in the matrix following translocation. Presequences have the potential to form amphipathic helices with one face being positively charged and the other being hydrophobic. Import of these proteins is achieved by the translocase in the outer membrane, the TOM complex, and a translocase of the inner membrane, the TIM23 complex (for a review, see Refs. 2Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar and 3Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Integral inner membrane proteins can be imported on the same pathway and are inserted into the membrane following arrest at the level of the TIM23 complex (4Van Loon A.P. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2441-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Kaput J. Goltz S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 15054-15058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was referred to as stop-transfer pathway, and all substrates identified so far are monotopic proteins. Either these proteins carry typical presequences that direct the N terminus into the matrix (6Rojo E.E. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8040-8047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), or alternatively, amphipathic helices directly C-terminal to transmembrane domains can function as internal signals that allow import and membrane insertion of loop-like protein structures. Upon arrest of the transmembrane domain in the inner membrane, these proteins acquire an Nout-Cintopology in the membrane (7Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A second group of inner membrane proteins is inserted from the mitochondrial matrix. These proteins carry presequences that direct them across both mitochondrial membranes. Because protein integration occurs in the same direction as in bacteria, this route was called the conservative sorting pathway (8Hartl F.U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W.

Both ldlBp and ldlCp are necessary for maintaining normal structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, although the precise function remains to be investigated.Using antibodies against the recombinant Sec34 N-terminal fragment, evidence is presented to support a role for Sec34 in ER-to-Golgi transport in mammalian cells. Significantly, the observation that antibodies against Sec34 could co-immunoprecipitate GTC-90, ldlBp, and others suggests that Sec34, GTC-90, ldlBp, and ldlCp are part of the same protein complex(es) that may regulate diverse aspects of the Golgi functions, including ER-to-Golgi transport.DISCUSSIONSec34, GTC-90, and ldlBp/ldlCp have been independently identified by different approaches. Sec34 was identified based on a genomic approach to search for the mammalian homologue of Sec34p (Ref. 20Suvorova E.S. Kurten R.C. Lupashin V.V. J. Biol.

Ashkenas J. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of the most important discoveries of the present study is that Sec34, GTC-90, and ldlBp/ldlCp are components of the same protein complex(es) (we tentatively refer to this as the Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex). This is based on several lines of observations. Firstly, GTC-90 and ldlBp (as well as Dor1 and Cod1) could be efficiently and specifically co-immunoprecipitated from rat liver cytosol by antibodies against Sec34. Secondly, upon expression by transient transfection, myc-tagged ldlBp, ldlCp, Dor1, Cod1, and Cod2 could be similarly co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Sec34 antibodies. Finally, direct interaction of Sec34 with ldlBp and ldlCp could be demonstrated in the absence of other subunits using in vitro-translated proteins. While this work was in progress, the yeast Sec34p-Sec35p complex was shown to consist of eight subunits: Sec34p, Sec35p, Dor1p, Cod1p, Cod2p, Cod3p, Cod4p, and Cod5p. Mammalian homologues for Dor1p, Cod1p, Cod2p, and Cod4p, but not Cod3p or Cod5p, have been also identified (32Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and GTC-90 appears to be the counterpart of Cod4p. An ∼110-amino acid region of ldlCp was found to be homologous to Sec35p, indicating some relatedness between ldlCp and Sec35p (32Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no homologue for ldlBp was identified in yeast, suggesting either that there is another subunit that remains to be uncovered in the yeast Sec34p-Sec35p complex or that ldlBp could be a functional counterpart of either Cod3p or Cod5p. Although we favor the possibility that ldlBp (980 amino acids for mouse protein and 962 amino acids for human protein) is not a functional counterpart of Cod3p (417 amino acids) or Cod5p (279 amino acids) due to the lack of similarity of their amino acid sequences and the huge differences in sizes, additional studies are needed to establish this point. Because myc-tagged ldlCp can be co-immunoprecipitated with Sec34 upon expression by transient transfection and a direct interaction between Sec34 and myc-ldlCp could be observed, ldlCp is indeed a component of the Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex. Because ldlCp (731 and 738 amino acids for mouse and human protein, respectively) is much larger than Sec35p (275 amino acids), and the observed sequence homology (24% identity over a region of 110 amino acids) is limited, additional evidence is required to resolve whether ldlCp is the structural and/or functional counterpart of yeast Sec35p. The direct interaction of ldlBp or ldlCp with Sec34 suggests that Sec34 harbors structural information for direct interaction with ldlBp and ldlCp in the absence of other subunits.The other potential subunits (Dor1, Cod1, and Cod2) of the mammalian Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex were similarly confirmed immunologically and/or biochemically as components of the Sec34-containing protein complex(es). Both Dor1 and Cod1 were recovered in Sec34 immunoprecipitates. Epitope-tagged versions of Dor1, Cod1, and Cod2, upon expression by transient transfection, could be co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Sec34 antibodies at efficiencies comparable to those observed for ldlBp and ldlCp under similar conditions. In summary, six other proteins (ldlBp, ldlCp, Dor1, Cod1, Cod2, and GTC-90/Cod4) in mammalian cells are shown here to be present in the Sec34-containing protein complex(es), with ldlBp and ldlCp having the ability to interact directly with Sec34. It remains possible that these proteins, together with others that have yet to be discovered, may form distinct complexes or subcomplexes. If we assume that a functional counterpart of ldlBp exists in yeast, then at least two other proteins (Cod3 and Cod5) remain to be discovered for the mammalian complex(es). However, if ldlBp is a functional counterpart of Cod3 or Cod5, then we have uncovered all but one of the components of the mammalian complex.The function of the Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex in mammalian cells remains to be explored. In view of all available results, it could be suggested that the Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex may have a general role in the Golgi apparatus that regulates several trafficking events, including ER-to-Golgi transport, various intra-Golgi transports, and possibly endosome-to-trans-Golgi network traffic. The role of Sec34p and Sec35p in ER-to-Golgi transport has been well established in yeast (9Kim D.W. Sacher M. Scarpa A. Quinn A.M. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Kim D.W. Massey T. Sacher M. Pypaert M. Ferro-Novick S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Using a modified assay that reconstitutes synchronized transport of almost all ER-arrested VSVG to the Golgi, it was shown that anti-Sec34 antibodies could exhibit dose-dependent inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition could be neutralized by a noninhibitory amount of the antigen. We have thus provided evidence that Sec34 plays a similar role in ER-to-Golgi transport in mammalian cells, although the temporal and other mechanistic aspects of its action remain to be explored. Although a role for Sec34p or other subunits in intra-Golgi transport in yeast has yet to be investigated, the purification of GTC-90 complex using an in vitrointra-Golgi transport assay suggests that this complex could be intimately involved in intra-Golgi transport (21Walter D.M. Paul K.S. Waters M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29565-29576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A role for Sec34p in endosome-to-TGN transport has been reported, and this was the basis for which Sec34p was independently identified as Grd20p (41Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4263-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that the role of Sec34p/Grd20p in endosome-to-TGN transport could be due to an indirect effect due to its role in ER-to-Golgi transport (10Kim D.W. Massey T. Sacher M. Pypaert M. Ferro-Novick S. Traffic. 2001; 2: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Van Rheenen S.M. Cao X. Sapperstein S.K. Chiang E.C. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the recent identification of the Sec34p complex and the relatedness of this complex with Ypt6p function indicate that the Sec34p-Grd20p complex might have a direct role in endosome-to-TGN transport (32Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Detailed studies of this complex and its individual subunits using genetic, biochemical, and cell biochemical approaches in both yeast and mammalian cells will provide additional understanding of its function and mechanism as well as the general organization and regulation of Golgi structure and function. Protein transport from the ER1 to the Golgi in mammalian cells involves several key steps (1Allan B.B. Balch W.E. Science. 1999; 285: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2831-2839PubMed Google Scholar). Cargo proteins and components necessary for downstream steps are first exported from the ER exit sites via the action of COPII components (3Tang B.L. Ong Y.S. Huang B. Wei S. Wong E.T., Qi, R.

COPII vesicles and/or clusters of COPII vesicles are believed to undergo homotypic fusion to form pleiotropic transport intermediates (1Allan B.B. Balch W.E.

Using antibodies against the recombinant Sec34 N-terminal fragment, evidence is presented to support a role for Sec34 in ER-to-Golgi transport in mammalian cells. Significantly, the observation that antibodies against Sec34 could co-immunoprecipitate GTC-90, ldlBp, and others suggests that Sec34, GTC-90, ldlBp, and ldlCp are part of the same protein complex(es) that may regulate diverse aspects of the Golgi functions, including ER-to-Golgi transport. DISCUSSIONSec34, GTC-90, and ldlBp/ldlCp have been independently identified by different approaches. Sec34 was identified based on a genomic approach to search for the mammalian homologue of Sec34p (Ref. 20Suvorova E.S. Kurten R.C. Lupashin V.V. J. Biol.

GTC-90 was previously identified as a component of a novel protein complex that participates in intra-Golgi transport using an in vitro biochemical assay (21Walter D.M. Paul K.S. Waters M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29565-29576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ldlBp and ldlCp were originally identified by a genetic approach (22Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S.

Ashkenas J. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of the most important discoveries of the present study is that Sec34, GTC-90, and ldlBp/ldlCp are components of the same protein complex(es) (we tentatively refer to this as the Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex). This is based on several lines of observations. Firstly, GTC-90 and ldlBp (as well as Dor1 and Cod1) could be efficiently and specifically co-immunoprecipitated from rat liver cytosol by antibodies against Sec34. Secondly, upon expression by transient transfection, myc-tagged ldlBp, ldlCp, Dor1, Cod1, and Cod2 could be similarly co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Sec34 antibodies. Finally, direct interaction of Sec34 with ldlBp and ldlCp could be demonstrated in the absence of other subunits using in vitro-translated proteins. While this work was in progress, the yeast Sec34p-Sec35p complex was shown to consist of eight subunits: Sec34p, Sec35p, Dor1p, Cod1p, Cod2p, Cod3p, Cod4p, and Cod5p. Mammalian homologues for Dor1p, Cod1p, Cod2p, and Cod4p, but not Cod3p or Cod5p, have been also identified (32Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and GTC-90 appears to be the counterpart of Cod4p. An ∼110-amino acid region of ldlCp was found to be homologous to Sec35p, indicating some relatedness between ldlCp and Sec35p (32Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no homologue for ldlBp was identified in yeast, suggesting either that there is another subunit that remains to be uncovered in the yeast Sec34p-Sec35p complex or that ldlBp could be a functional counterpart of either Cod3p or Cod5p. Although we favor the possibility that ldlBp (980 amino acids for mouse protein and 962 amino acids for human protein) is not a functional counterpart of Cod3p (417 amino acids) or Cod5p (279 amino acids) due to the lack of similarity of their amino acid sequences and the huge differences in sizes, additional studies are needed to establish this point. Because myc-tagged ldlCp can be co-immunoprecipitated with Sec34 upon expression by transient transfection and a direct interaction between Sec34 and myc-ldlCp could be observed, ldlCp is indeed a component of the Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex. Because ldlCp (731 and 738 amino acids for mouse and human protein, respectively) is much larger than Sec35p (275 amino acids), and the observed sequence homology (24% identity over a region of 110 amino acids) is limited, additional evidence is required to resolve whether ldlCp is the structural and/or functional counterpart of yeast Sec35p. The direct interaction of ldlBp or ldlCp with Sec34 suggests that Sec34 harbors structural information for direct interaction with ldlBp and ldlCp in the absence of other subunits.The other potential subunits (Dor1, Cod1, and Cod2) of the mammalian Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex were similarly confirmed immunologically and/or biochemically as components of the Sec34-containing protein complex(es). Both Dor1 and Cod1 were recovered in Sec34 immunoprecipitates. Epitope-tagged versions of Dor1, Cod1, and Cod2, upon expression by transient transfection, could be co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Sec34 antibodies at efficiencies comparable to those observed for ldlBp and ldlCp under similar conditions. In summary, six other proteins (ldlBp, ldlCp, Dor1, Cod1, Cod2, and GTC-90/Cod4) in mammalian cells are shown here to be present in the Sec34-containing protein complex(es), with ldlBp and ldlCp having the ability to interact directly with Sec34. It remains possible that these proteins, together with others that have yet to be discovered, may form distinct complexes or subcomplexes. If we assume that a functional counterpart of ldlBp exists in yeast, then at least two other proteins (Cod3 and Cod5) remain to be discovered for the mammalian complex(es). However, if ldlBp is a functional counterpart of Cod3 or Cod5, then we have uncovered all but one of the components of the mammalian complex.The function of the Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex in mammalian cells remains to be explored. In view of all available results, it could be suggested that the Sec34-GTC-90-ldlBp complex may have a general role in the Golgi apparatus that regulates several trafficking events, including ER-to-Golgi transport, various intra-Golgi transports, and possibly endosome-to-trans-Golgi network traffic. The role of Sec34p and Sec35p in ER-to-Golgi transport has been well established in yeast (9Kim D.W. Sacher M. Scarpa A. Quinn A.M. Ferro-Novick S. Mol. Biol.

Using a modified assay that reconstitutes synchronized transport of almost all ER-arrested VSVG to the Golgi, it was shown that anti-Sec34 antibodies could exhibit dose-dependent inhibition. Furthermore, the inhibition could be neutralized by a noninhibitory amount of the antigen. We have thus provided evidence that Sec34 plays a similar role in ER-to-Golgi transport in mammalian cells, although the temporal and other mechanistic aspects of its action remain to be explored. Although a role for Sec34p or other subunits in intra-Golgi transport in yeast has yet to be investigated, the purification of GTC-90 complex using an in vitrointra-Golgi transport assay suggests that this complex could be intimately involved in intra-Golgi transport (21Walter D.M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 4263-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that the role of Sec34p/Grd20p in endosome-to-TGN transport could be due to an indirect effect due to its role in ER-to-Golgi transport (10Kim D.W. Massey T. Sacher M.

Detailed studies of this complex and its individual subunits using genetic, biochemical, and cell biochemical approaches in both yeast and mammalian cells will provide additional understanding of its function and mechanism as well as the general organization and regulation of Golgi structure and function.

Using a basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cell line expressing wild-type PAF receptor (PAFR) and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (mPAFR), we have previously demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation mediates desensitization of PAF-induced degranulation. Here, we sought to determine the role of receptor phosphorylation on PAF-induced LTC4 generation and CCL2 production. We found that PAF caused a significantly enhanced LTC4 generation in cells expressing mPAFR when compared with PAFR cells. In contrast, PAF-induced CCL2 production was greatly reduced in mPAFR cells. Pertussis toxin and U0126, which inhibit Gi and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) activation, respectively, caused very little inhibition of PAF-induced CCL2 production (∼20% inhibition). In contrast, these inhibitors almost completely blocked both PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation and LTC4 generation in PAFR cells. However, in mPAFR cells pertussis toxin only partially inhibited PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation. A Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor had no effect on PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation in PAFR cells but completely blocked the response in mPAFR cells. These data demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation, which serves to desensitize PAF-induced LTC4 generation, is required for chemokine CCL2 production. They also indicate a previously unrecognized selectivity in G protein usage and ERK activation for PAF-induced responses. Whereas PAF-induced CCL2 production is, in large part, mediated independently of Gi activation or ERK phosphorylation, LTC4 generation requires ERK phosphorylation, which is mediated by different G proteins depending on the phosphorylation status of the receptor.

However, the chemoattractants formylpeptide and the complement component C3a stimulate ERK phosphorylation via pathways that do not require receptor phosphorylation or β-arrestin recruitment (17Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Gilbert T.L. Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Cimino D.F. Prossnitz E.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that C3a receptor phosphorylation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase provides a stimulatory signal that synergizes with ERK activation to induce chemokine CCL2 (also known as monocytes chemoattractant protein-1 or MCP-1) production (17Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Unlike the C3a receptor, which couples to Gi, the PAF receptor interacts with the Gi and Gq family of G proteins to induce distinct biological responses (4Haribabu B.

In the present study, we sought to determine the roles of receptor phosphorylation, G protein usage, and ERK phosphorylation on PAF-induced LTC4 generation and CCL2 production. For this purpose, RBL-2H3 cells expressing the wild-type PAF receptor (PAFR) and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of PAFR (mPAFR) were used (14Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation, which serves to desensitize PAF-induced LTC4 generation, is required for chemokine CCL2 production. Furthermore, CCL2 production is, in large part, mediated independently of Gi activation or ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, LTC4 generation is dependent on ERK phosphorylation, which is mediated via different mechanisms depending on the phosphorylation status of the receptor.DISCUSSIONPAF plays an important role in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases (31Ishii S.

We have previously utilized RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing PAFR and a cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant receptor (mPAFR) and demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation plays an important role in the desensitization of PAF-induced degranulation (14Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to determine the role of receptor phosphorylation on PAF-induced LTC4 generation and chemokine CCL2 production. Here, we demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation desensitizes PAF-induced LTC4 generation but provides a stimulatory signal for chemokine CCL2 production. We also show distinct differences in both G protein usage and ERK phosphorylation on LTC4 generation and CCL2 production.We recently reported that complement component C3a stimulates CCL2 production via a pathway that requires receptor phosphorylation (17Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Schwarz and Murphy (34Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showed that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus stimulates chemokine gene expression via the activation of a GPCR. However, truncation of the final five amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which contains one serine and two threonine residues, resulted in a significant decrease in chemokine production. These findings suggest that receptor phosphorylation likely provides a general mechanism for stimulating GPCR-induced chemokine gene expression. The receptor phosphorylation-dependent signal that mediates chemokine production is not known. A substantial and growing body of evidence suggests that the interaction of phosphorylated receptors with the adapter molecule β-arrestin leads to the formation of a scaffold in the cytoplasm of cells. This complex directly interacts with Src, raf-1, ERK, c-Jun amino terminal kinase 3 (JNK-3), and a small GTP-binding protein, ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF-6), to induce their activation (20Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

These findings suggest that β-arrestin could be involved in PAF-induced CCL2 production. The demonstration that PAF caused the recruitment of β-arrestin in cells expressing PAFR but not mPAFR is consistent with this notion. It is, however, important to note that the ligand-induced phosphorylation of PAFR and the interaction of the phosphorylated receptor with β-arrestin do not require G protein activation (36Chen Z. Dupre D.J., Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7356-7362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTX, which had no effect on ligand-induced PAFR phosphorylation (4Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C. Richardson R.M. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37087-37092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), caused a substantial inhibition of PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation but had very little effect on CCL2 production. In addition, U0126, which completely blocked PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation, did not cause a substantial inhibition of CCL2 production. These findings suggest that if β-arrestin mediates PAF-induced CCL2 production, it does so via the activation of a pathway that is mostly independent of G protein activation and ERK phosphorylation.We have shown in the present study that when PAFR and mPAFR were expressed at similar levels in RBL-2H3 cells, PAF was able to induce CCL2 production in mPAFR cells but at lower level (Fig. 3). Schwarz and Murphy (34Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) also made a similar observation for a wild-type and a mutant GPCR for a Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus lacking serine and threonine residues at its carboxyl terminus. These findings suggest that receptor phosphorylation alone does not provide a full signal for chemokine production. This contention is supported by the finding that the inhibition of Gαq-mediated responses such as Ca2+ mobilization and PKC activation leads to the inhibition of PAF-induced CCL2 production in PAFR cells. We have previously shown that C3a-induced chemokine production requires the interaction of two signals, one receptor phosphorylation-dependent and the other G protein-dependent (17Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation with PAFR, the G protein-dependent signal for the C3a receptor (C3aR) involves Gi-mediated ERK phosphorylation (17Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GPCR-induced chemokine production is mediated via shared (receptor phosphorylation-dependent) and distinct pathways that differ in the G protein usage of the receptor.The demonstration in the present study that the treatment of cells with U0126 or a Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor leads to a substantial inhibition of PAF-induced LTC4 generation is consistent with the roles of ERK phosphorylation and Ca2+ mobilization on LTC4 generation (7Syrbu S.I.

Although PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation has been studied in some detail, the mechanism of its activation has not been clearly defined (30van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J.

The data presented herein indicate that PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation in RBL-2H3 cells is mediated by different mechanisms, depending on the phosphorylation status of the receptor. For example, PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation in PAFR cells requires activation of a PTX-sensitive G protein. In contrast, this response in mPAFR cells involves both PTX-sensitive as well as PTX-insensitive G proteins. We have previously shown that PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization depends on the activation of Gαq (6Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration that the Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor fluphenazine blocked ERK phosphorylation in mPAFR but not PAFR cells raises the intriguing possibility that receptor phosphorylation modulates the G protein-coupling specificity of PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation.In summary, we have previously shown that receptor phosphorylation mediates the desensitization of PAF-induced degranulation (14Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation also serves to desensitize PAF-induced LTC4 generation but provides a stimulatory signal for chemokine CCL2 production. The activation of many GPCRs leads to LTC4 generation and chemokine gene expression in a variety of cell types (27Hirabayashi T. Kume K. Hirose K. Yokomizo T. Iino M. Itoh H. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Therefore, receptor phosphorylation is likely to have a greater impact on cellular functions than previously recognized.

Unlike the C3a receptor, which couples to Gi, the PAF receptor interacts with the Gi and Gq family of G proteins to induce distinct biological responses (4Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine the roles of receptor phosphorylation, G protein usage, and ERK phosphorylation on PAF-induced LTC4 generation and CCL2 production. For this purpose, RBL-2H3 cells expressing the wild-type PAF receptor (PAFR) and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of PAFR (mPAFR) were used (14Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation, which serves to desensitize PAF-induced LTC4 generation, is required for chemokine CCL2 production. Furthermore, CCL2 production is, in large part, mediated independently of Gi activation or ERK phosphorylation. In contrast, LTC4 generation is dependent on ERK phosphorylation, which is mediated via different mechanisms depending on the phosphorylation status of the receptor. DISCUSSIONPAF plays an important role in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases (31Ishii S. Shimizu T. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 41-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 32Montrucchio G. Alloatti G. Camussi G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1669-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). PAF stimulates chemotaxis and degranulation in leukocytes (6Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D.

We have previously utilized RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing PAFR and a cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant receptor (mPAFR) and demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation plays an important role in the desensitization of PAF-induced degranulation (14Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to determine the role of receptor phosphorylation on PAF-induced LTC4 generation and chemokine CCL2 production. Here, we demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation desensitizes PAF-induced LTC4 generation but provides a stimulatory signal for chemokine CCL2 production. We also show distinct differences in both G protein usage and ERK phosphorylation on LTC4 generation and CCL2 production.We recently reported that complement component C3a stimulates CCL2 production via a pathway that requires receptor phosphorylation (17Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Schwarz and Murphy (34Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showed that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus stimulates chemokine gene expression via the activation of a GPCR. However, truncation of the final five amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, which contains one serine and two threonine residues, resulted in a significant decrease in chemokine production. These findings suggest that receptor phosphorylation likely provides a general mechanism for stimulating GPCR-induced chemokine gene expression. The receptor phosphorylation-dependent signal that mediates chemokine production is not known. A substantial and growing body of evidence suggests that the interaction of phosphorylated receptors with the adapter molecule β-arrestin leads to the formation of a scaffold in the cytoplasm of cells. This complex directly interacts with Src, raf-1, ERK, c-Jun amino terminal kinase 3 (JNK-3), and a small GTP-binding protein, ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF-6), to induce their activation (20Luttrell L.M.

These findings suggest that β-arrestin could be involved in PAF-induced CCL2 production. The demonstration that PAF caused the recruitment of β-arrestin in cells expressing PAFR but not mPAFR is consistent with this notion. It is, however, important to note that the ligand-induced phosphorylation of PAFR and the interaction of the phosphorylated receptor with β-arrestin do not require G protein activation (36Chen Z. Dupre D.J., Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7356-7362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTX, which had no effect on ligand-induced PAFR phosphorylation (4Haribabu B. Zhelev D.V. Pridgen B.C. Richardson R.M. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37087-37092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), caused a substantial inhibition of PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation but had very little effect on CCL2 production. In addition, U0126, which completely blocked PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation, did not cause a substantial inhibition of CCL2 production. These findings suggest that if β-arrestin mediates PAF-induced CCL2 production, it does so via the activation of a pathway that is mostly independent of G protein activation and ERK phosphorylation.We have shown in the present study that when PAFR and mPAFR were expressed at similar levels in RBL-2H3 cells, PAF was able to induce CCL2 production in mPAFR cells but at lower level (Fig. 3). Schwarz and Murphy (34Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) also made a similar observation for a wild-type and a mutant GPCR for a Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus lacking serine and threonine residues at its carboxyl terminus. These findings suggest that receptor phosphorylation alone does not provide a full signal for chemokine production. This contention is supported by the finding that the inhibition of Gαq-mediated responses such as Ca2+ mobilization and PKC activation leads to the inhibition of PAF-induced CCL2 production in PAFR cells. We have previously shown that C3a-induced chemokine production requires the interaction of two signals, one receptor phosphorylation-dependent and the other G protein-dependent (17Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation with PAFR, the G protein-dependent signal for the C3a receptor (C3aR) involves Gi-mediated ERK phosphorylation (17Ahamed J. Haribabu B. Ali H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GPCR-induced chemokine production is mediated via shared (receptor phosphorylation-dependent) and distinct pathways that differ in the G protein usage of the receptor.The demonstration in the present study that the treatment of cells with U0126 or a Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor leads to a substantial inhibition of PAF-induced LTC4 generation is consistent with the roles of ERK phosphorylation and Ca2+ mobilization on LTC4 generation (7Syrbu S.I.

We have previously shown that PAF-induced Ca2+ mobilization depends on the activation of Gαq (6Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2010706444,"Aggrecan, a major structural proteoglycan in cartilage, contains three globular domains, G1, G2, and G3, as well as sequences for glycosaminoglycan modification. A large number of proteases are implicated in aggrecan cleavage in normal metabolism, aging, and arthritis. These proteases are known to cleave at the IGD, KS, and CS domains. Here we report for the first time evidence of cleavage at a novel site, the carboxyl tail of aggrecan. Results from deletion mutants of the tail indicated that the likely cleavage sites were two consensus sequences, RRLXK and RSPR, present in the aggrecan analogs of many species. This was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. A construct containing two G3 domains (G3G3) was also found to cleave between the G3 duplicates. When G3 tail was linked to a glycosaminoglycan-modifying sequence, it was protected from cleavage. Furin inhibitor also reduced the levels of tail cleavage. The carboxyl tails of chicken and human versican were not cleaved, despite the presence of the consensus sequence. Our studies indicate that the basic amino acids present in the tail play an important role in cleavage, and this mechanism is specific to aggrecan.

All are composed of a signal peptide, a globular domain named G1, a large fragment for chondroitin sulfate modification (CS1 sequence), and a globular domain G3 (1Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The G1 domain, which is homologous to link protein, contains one immunoglobulin (IgG)-like domain and two tandem repeat motifs (2Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia. 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Perkins S.J. Nealis A.S.

Aggrecan is unique in containing an additional globular domain G2 that is structurally similar to the tandem repeats of the G1 domain. An inter-globular domain (IGD) is located between the G1 and G2 domains, and a segment modified by keratan sulfate (KS sequence) is situated between the G2 domain and the CS sequence. The G3 domain is composed of one or two alternatively spliced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif(s), one lectin (also called carbohydrate recognition domain or CRD)-like motif, one complement binding protein (CBP)-like motif, and a short C-terminal tail (2Li H.

The structures of these motifs, especially the tail, are highly conserved in aggrecan across species boundaries. In the early stages of cartilage development, versican is the predominant proteoglycan and is believed to play an important role in tissue development. After cartilage maturation, versican is replaced by aggrecan, which facilitates the formation of a matrix network for resilience and load-bearing. Aggrecan processing seems to be regulated, in part, by the G3 domain. This was initially observed in the chicken disorder nanomelia, which produces a lethal phenotype in homozygous form (due to failure of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis) and dwarfism in heterozygote form (7Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Flay N. Kearns A.E. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11105-11112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cartilage of the nanomelic mutant lacks aggrecan in its matrix. It was discovered that the core protein of this mutant aggrecan is truncated as a result of a premature stop codon at the N-terminal side of G3 (2Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, its secretion is hindered and no modification by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains occurs (7Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Flay N. Kearns A.E. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11105-11112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that the G3 and G1 domains play roles in processing of recombinant aggrecan and versican (8Day J.M. Murdoch A.D. Hardingham T.E. J. Biol.

Extensive aggrecan degradation occurs during normal cartilage metabolism, aging, and joint diseases (15Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ilic M.Z. Handley C.J. Robinson H.C. Mok M.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In mature cartilage, up to half of the aggrecan population loses its G3 domain. The other domains are also subjected to cleavage, resulting in the release of degraded fragments in the matrix. The exception is the G1 domain, which is trapped and retained by hyaluronan. Loss of aggrecan is a major feature of cartilage degradation associated with arthritis (6Lohmander L.S. Neame P.J. Sandy J.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 6: 1214-1222Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis, the chondroitin sulfate-bearing sequence of aggrecan, the CS domain, is preferentially released. The synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis and joint injury contains fragments of degraded aggrecan (17Lohmander L.S. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 43: 75-77Google Scholar). A large number of proteases are known to cleave aggrecan, and their target sites are located in the IGD, KS, and CS domains (15Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol.

No protease has yet been reported to cleave inside the globular domains, or in the carboxyl tail. Our preliminary studies suggested that the carboxyl tail of aggrecan is removed during product secretion. After transfecting COS-7 cells with a His-tagged (at the C terminus) G3 construct, we did not detect the His-tagged G3 product in culture medium but detected this product in cell lysate. An antibody against another epitope at the amino region allowed detection of product in both culture medium and cell lysate. Hence, we hypothesized that the G3 tail was removed after product secretion. The present study was designed to determine the mechanism of this process, to identify amino acid motifs that may be involved in this degradation, and to determine whether this process is specific to aggrecan or common to the proteoglycan family.

The G3His construct was generated by linking together the leading peptide (LP) of link protein, aggrecan G3 domain and a His-tag. The leading peptide contained link protein signal peptide and an epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 4B6 (26Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G3KS construct contained the leading peptide, aggrecan G3 domain, aggrecan KS domain, and a His-tag.Figure 6Cleavage of G3 tail inhibited by glycosaminoglycan chains. Cell lysate and culture medium from G3G3 and G3KS were analyzed on Western blot probed with 4B6. The G3G3 products in the lysate had the expected size. However, most of the secreted G3G3 product had a size similar to that of G3His. The faint band at 70 kDa probably represents intact G3G3. The G3KS product also exhibited the expected size, and the smear (the larger sizes) suggested GAG chain attachment to the KS sequence. No cleavage was observed for G3KS product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Human and chicken versican contain the consensus sequence RXXR in their G3 tail but are not cleaved. A, linking native human or chicken versican G3 cDNA with the aggrecan G3 domain produced hvG3aG3 and cvG3aG3 constructs. Two additional constructs (hvRSPRaG3 and cvRSPRaG3) were engineered to contain the consensus sequence RSPR in the tails of human and chicken versican G3 domains. B, cell lysate (L) and culture medium (M) of hvG3aG3, cvG3aG3, cvRSPRaG3, hvRSPRaG3, and G3G3 were analyzed on Western blot probed with 4B6. Little product cleavage was detected in the culture medium from hvG3aG3-, cvG3aG3-, hvRSPRaG3-, and cvRSPRaG3-transfected cells, but the majority (∼90%) of aggrecan G3G3 product was cleaved.C, bovine chondrocytes were transiently transfected with G3G3, G3allmutG3, cvG3aG3, hvG3aG3, and a control vector pcDNA3. Cell lysate (L) and culture medium (M) were analyzed on Western blot probed with 4B6. All constructs were well expressed and secreted. The G3G3 product in the culture medium was completely cleaved, and a small amount of the cell-associated G3G3 product was cleaved. D, the constructs G3His and cvG3ΔEGFHis (from chicken versican G3 domain) were expressed in COS-7 cells. Cell lysate (L) and culture medium (M) were analyzed on Western blot probed with anti-His antibody. Only the His epitope in the secreted product of cvG3ΔEGFHis (but not of G3His) was detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The HisG3 construct was generated by ligating two fragments, the leading peptide containing a His-tag and the G3 domain, into pcDNA3. The leading peptide containing a His-tag was produced using two primers, LP40CHisXhoI and LPNKozakEcoRI (for sequences see Table I), in a PCR using link protein as a template. The PCR product was doubly digested withEcoRI and XhoI, purified, and ligated with the G3 fragment, which was derived by digesting the G3His construct, into pcDNA3.Table ISequence and restriction endonuclease sites for oligonucleotides Open table in a new tab The remaining 39 constructs were based on the G3His construct. They all contain the leading peptide, the CRD and CBP motifs, a modified tail, and the His-tag. Modification of the tail was performed through either systematic incremental deletion, site-directed mutagenesis, or engineering of a potential site for cleavage from other species or proteoglycans into the tail. Ten constructs were made to contain incremental deletion of the tail. Two types of deletion were made. In the first type, the entire tail was incrementally deleted producing 5 constructs (C2, C7, C13, C16, and C20). This type was based on the plasmid Type I (see Fig.2 A). The end of the tail contains a restriction enzyme siteXbaI (encoding two amino acids SR) followed by a His-tag. The original XbaI site on the vector was inactivated by ligation with the restriction enzyme site NheI. The primersNheIHisXbaIXhoI and CRDNXhoI were used in a PCR with aggrecan G3 domain as a template. The product was purified, digested with XhoI andNheI, and inserted into XhoI- andXbaI-digested G3His construct to generate the Type I construct. To generate incremental deletion mutations, two primers were used in each PCR: one complementary to the 5′ terminus of G3 domain (CRDNXhoI) whereas the other was complementary to the desired 3′ region of the tail. For example, primer C2CXbaI and CRDNXhoI were used in a PCR using G3 as template. The PCR product was purified, doubly digested with XhoI andXbaI, and ligated with XhoI- andXbaI-digested Type I plasmid to produce construct C2. Primer C7CXbaI was combined with CRDNXhoI to produce the construct C7. C13CXbaI was used for production of construct C13, whereas C16CXbaI was used for construct C16 and C20CXbaI was used for construct C20 (see Fig.2 B). To produce the second type of incremental deletion, nine amino acids from the extreme 3′-end of the tail were linked to the His-tag in a PCR, using the primers XbaItailHis and pcDNA3XmaI (complementary to nucleotides 2091–2096 of the vector). The PCR product was digested with XbaI andXmaI and inserted into XbaI- andXmaI-digested construct C2 resulting in the construct C2tail. Replacement of the XbaI-XmaI fragment from the construct C7 with the PCR product produced construct C7tail. Constructs C13tail, C16tail, and C20tail were generated in the same way. Another ten constructs contained site-directed mutagenesis in the tail that could be divided into three groups. In Group 1, the first potential consensus sequence (amino acids RRLYKR, see Fig.3 A) was mutated: in each construct, one basic amino acid was mutated to a non-basic amino acid. For example, two primers, CSDFBamHI and CR8PXbaI, were used in a PCR with C13tail as a template. The primer CR8PXbaI generated a single mutation at amino acid C8 (R → P). The PCR product was purified, doubly digested with XhoI and XbaI, and ligated into XhoI- and XbaI-digested vector from the construct C13tail. Using primers CR9PXbaI and CSDFBamHI, we generated a single mutation at amino acid C9 (R → P) and produced the construct CR9P. Likewise, combined with CSDFBamHI, primers CK12AXbaI and CR13SXbaI were used to generate constructs CK12A and CR13S, respectively. In the second group, we linked the second consensus sequence to construct C2tail (see Fig. 3 A). This was performed by using two primers, CSDFBamHI and del8–12, which deleted the first motif, amino acids 8–12, in a PCR with G3 domain as a template. The PCR product was purified, digested withXhoI and XbaI, and ligated into XhoI- and XbaI-digested C2tail. Combined with primer CSDFBamHI, primer delR13SXbaI was used to generate a mutation at amino acid 13 to produce the construct delR13S, and primer delR16PXbaI was used to generate a mutation at amino acid 16 to produce the construct delR16P. In the third group, each construct contained multiple mutations. Construct Muttail was generated in a PCR using two primers, CSDFBamHI and muttailXbaI. The PCR product was inserted intoXhoI- and XbaI-digested construct C20. Construct G3KRTS was generated using two primers CSDFBamHI and G3KRTSXbaI, and, after similar treatment, the PCR product was inserted into XhoI- and XbaI-digested plasmid C20tail. Using a similar method, the primers G3allmutXbaI and CSDFBamHI were used to produce the construct G3allmut (see Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Mutation of all basic amino acid residues completely inhibits tail cleavage. A, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out at multiple sites to remove important basic amino acids in the G3 tail. The first construct (G3KRTS) contained mutations in C12 (K → T) and C13 (R → S). The second construct (G3allmut) contained mutations of 6 amino acids (boldface).B, cell lysate (L) and culture medium (M) from cultures transfected with these two constructs and C2tail (as control) were analyzed on Western blot. 4B6 probing showed that all constructs were well expressed. Probing with anti-His antibody revealed consistent levels of products in cell lysate. However, the amount of secreted products from G3KRTS-transfected was only 10% of that from C2tail-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Four constructs contained consensus sequences obtained from bovine, human, dog, mouse, or rat aggrecan (see Fig. 5). These constructs have similar structure: the putative cleavage motif was engineered into the construct C7tail. For example, the sequence RRLQKR from the first potential cleavage site of rat, human, or dog was linked to 3′ of the construct C2 by using two primers, CSDFBamHI and HuC8–13XbaI, in a PCR. After treatment similar that described above, the PCR product was inserted into XhoI- andXbaI-digested plasmid C7tail to produce the chimeric construct HuC8–13. The sequence RHLQKR (from bovine potential cleavage site) was linked to the 3′ of the construct C7 using the primers BoC8–13XbaI and CSDFBamHI to generate the chimeric construct BoC8–13. The second potential protease site, RSSR, from rat, human, or dog was linked to 3′ of the construct C7 using primers HuC13–16XbaI and CSDFBamHI to produce the chimeric construct HuC13–16. The third potential protease site in human aggrecan, RHPR, was linked to 3′ of the construct C7 using primer HuC16–19XbaI and CSDFBamHI to generate the chimeric construct HuC16–19. Fifteen constructs are based on a G3-G3 duplex. The G3G3 construct was generated by replacing the His-tag in the G3His construct with a G3His fragment (see Fig. 6). Two separate aliquots of the G3His construct were doubly digested with (i) EcoRI and SalI and (ii) XhoI and EcoRI to purify LP60G3 and G3His+pcDNA3, respectively. The two fragments were then ligated together. Ten constructs (C2G3, C7G3, C13G3, CR9PG3, CK12AG3, CR13SG3, G3KRTSG3, G3allmutG3, del8–12G3, huC8–13G3) contained the mutated or truncated G3 in addition to normal aggrecan G3 (see Fig. 8). This was achieved by replacing the junction of the mutated or truncated G3 and pcDNA3 vector (XbaI-ApaI) withXbaI-ApaI-containing normal G3. The latter G3 was obtained in a PCR using aG3NXbaI and aG3CApaI as primers. The cvG3aG3 and hvG3aG3 were produced by linking the chicken versican G3 domain or human versican G3 domain with the normal aggrecan G3 domain as above (see Fig. 9). Generation of chicken versican G3 domain has been described by us previously (27Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33054-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y., Wu, Y. Cao L. Lee V. Chen L. Lin Z. Kiani C. Adams M.E. Yang B.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We used an reverse transcriptase-PCR (with hvG3NXhoI and hvG3CXbaI as primers and glioma total RNA as template) to produce human versican G3 domain. Finally, we engineered the consensus sequence RSPR in the tail of chicken and human versican G3 domains (in constructs cvG3aG3 and hvG3aG3, respectively) using primers cvG3CRSPRXbaI and hvG3CRSPRXbaI in PCR reactions. DNA was amplified in PCRs using pairs of appropriate primers. The reaction mixture (total volume, 100 μl) contained 200 μm dNTPs, 0. 2 μg of each primer, 50 ng of template DNA, 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and the Mg2+-containing buffer. The reactions were carried out at 94 °C for 5 min for one cycle; 94 °C (60 s), 55 °C (60 s), and 72 °C (60 s) for 25 cycles; and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. DNA products were purified then doubly digested with two appropriate restriction endonucleases. The DNA was ligated into the linearized plasmid pcDNA3. The ligation reaction was carried out at 16 °C overnight. The ligation mixture was used for transformation of competent Escherichia colistrain DH5α. After clone selection, all new constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, performed by the Core Molecular Biology Laboratory at York University (Toronto, Ontario). The results were then compared with the published sequence. To analyze gene expression, COS-7 cells or bovine chondrocytes were transfected transiently with recombinant constructs using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, the cultured COS-7 cells or bovine chondrocytes were seeded onto 12-well tissue culture plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well). The cells were allowed to attach and grow overnight in DMEM containing 5% FBS. Cells were transfected once they reached 70% confluence. Lipofectin (2 μl) was incubated with plasmid DNA (∼2 μg) for 15 min in 100 μl of DMEM followed by the addition of 900 μl of DMEM. Concurrently, COS-7 cultures were washed with 2 ml of DMEM. The Lipofectin-DNA mixture was added to the cultures followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 h in an incubator. The DNA-Lipofectin mixture was replaced with 1 ml of DMEM containing 5% FBS. Three days later, culture medium was harvested, and dead and floating cells were removed by centrifugation. Cell lysate in each well was obtained by using 200 μl of lysis buffer. Because the volume of medium in each well is 5-fold the volume of lysis buffer used, the percentage of the portions of cell lysate used in each loading well (see below) represented 5-fold more than that of the medium. Cell lysate and culture medium were subjected to SDS-PAGE in separating gel containing 10–12% acrylamide. The buffer system was 1× TG (Tris-glycine buffer according to Amresco) containing 1% SDS. Separated proteins were transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane in 1× TG buffer containing 20% methanol at 60 V for 2 h in a cold room. The membrane was blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. 0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% nonfat dry milk powder (TBSTM) for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with the monoclonal antibody 4B6 or the anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody in TBSTM. The membranes were washed with TBST (3 × 30-min washes) and then incubated for 2 h with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:50,000 dilution) in TBSTM. After washing as above, the bound antibody were visualized with chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). To compare the G3 tail cleavage, it was necessary to load an equal amount of secreted products to each well on Western blot. To do so, the products of each construct, as well as one control (product of C2tail construct) were pre-analyzed on Western blot probed with 4B6, which is much more sensitive than the anti-His antibody. Equal amounts of gene products, obtained by dilution, were then analyzed for G3 tail cleavage probed with anti-His antibody. Because the affinity of anti-His antibody is much lower than the 4B6 antibody, we had to use larger amounts of products (∼ 3-fold) for anti-His staining. A reduction in the intensity of bands probed with anti-His antibody would suggest G3 tail cleavage. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with G3G3 construct. After overnight incubation, culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5% FBS and furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone. Protease inhibitors Amastatin and E64 were used as controls. Cell lysate and culture medium were harvested and analyzed on Western blot as above. Relative protein concentration was estimated by using a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) according to the manufacturer's instructions for scanning the densities of the signals on the films after Western blot. The relative intensity of each band after Western blot development is shown below the blot. In the case of product cleavage in duplex constructs, both protein bands (undegraded and degraded) were scanned and density was calculated using the following formula: degradation (%) = OD of degraded band/(OD of degraded band + OD of undegraded band). To assess the possibility of cleavage of the C-terminal tail of the chicken aggrecan G3 domain, we initially generated a G3 construct that contains the leading peptide of link protein at the N terminus. This leading peptide harbors the signal peptide and an epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 4B6 (26Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the C-terminal end of G3, a His-tag recognized by anti-His monoclonal antibody was added (G3His, Fig.1 A). After transfection of COS-7 cells with this G3 construct, the 4B6 antibody detected products (∼48 kDa) in both culture medium and cell lysate on Western blot (Fig. 1 B). However, the anti-His antibody failed to detect the product in culture medium, but could detect the product (∼48 kDa) in cell lysate (Fig. 1 C). This suggested that the G3 tail has been removed after product secretion. To test this, we generated another construct (HisG3) containing both the 4B6 epitope and the His-tag at the N-terminal region of the construct. Analysis of cell lysate and culture media from COS-7 cells transfected with HisG3 on Western blot indicated that products of HisG3 (∼48 kDa) were detec"

We have now examined the effects of disrupting these sites on the macroscopic desensitization properties of receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Desensitization was measured by the ability of low concentrations of bath-perfused agonist to reduce the current responses elicited by subsequent challenges with saturating concentrations of GABA. Wild-type receptors were desensitized by pre-perfused muscimol with an IC50∼0.7 μm, which correlates well with the lower affinity sites for this agonist that are measured in direct binding studies. Receptors carrying the β2 Y62S and Y62F mutations desensitized at slightly higher (2–7-fold) agonist concentrations. However, at low perfusate concentrations, the Y62S-containing receptor recovered from the desensitized state even in the continued presence of agonist. The characteristics of desensitization in the wild-type and mutant receptors lead us to suggest that the major role of the high affinity agonist-binding site(s) of the GABAA receptor is not to induce desensitization but rather to stabilize the desensitized state once it has been formed.

The molecular mechanisms by which this occurs have been subject to intense investigation but remain poorly understood (1Edmonds B. Gibb A.J. Colquhoun D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 495-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the general consensus is that agonist-induced conformational changes of the receptor protein induce the initial, if not all, phases of the process (2Ochoa E.R.M. Challopadhyay A. McNamee M.G. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1989; 9: 141-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs)1 are members of a receptor gene family (see Ref. 4Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Möhler H. Sieghart W. Biggio G. Braestrup C. Bateson A.N. Langer S.Z. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar) that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), glycine receptors, and the serotonin type 3 receptor. These receptors are structurally and functionally homologous and desensitize in the continued presence of agonist (5Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H.

Although the precise subunit compositions of native receptors remain to be established, a major subtype in the brain appears to be a combination of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits in a likely stoichiometry of 2:2:1 (7Chang Y.

Radioligand binding studies have revealed the existence of (at least) two classes of agonist recognition sites on a single GABAAR (10Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which differ in affinity by more than 1 order of magnitude (see also Refs. 11Olsen R.W. Bergman M.O.

By using the recombinant rat α1β2γ2 receptor expressed in tsA201 cells, we found two classes of binding sites for [3H]muscimol with Kd values of 8.1 and 430 nm (10Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because higher concentrations of muscimol are required to activate this receptor subtype (EC50 of 7.1 μm when expressed in Xenopus oocytes), sites of still lower affinity may be present (see below). Although the roles of these multiple sites in receptor function require clarification, it is generally accepted that the high affinity binding that is measured under equilibrium conditions reflects binding to a desensitized conformation(s) of the receptor (see Ref. 14Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is assumed that agonist occupancy of these sites in the resting state of the protein induces the conformational changes that lead to this equilibrium desensitized state. One approach to delineate the role of individual sites in receptor function is to use site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt selectively binding domains and to examine the consequences on receptor function. By using this approach, we have recently identified an amino acid residue (Tyr-62) of the β2 subunit of the GABAAR that is important for high affinity agonist binding (10Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue to a phenylalanine (Y62F) caused a significant decrease in agonist affinity, and mutation to a serine (Y62S) led to a loss of measurable high affinity binding sites. In this study, we have expressed recombinant wild-type and mutant GABAA receptors in Xenopus oocytes and have developed methods to study aspects of the desensitization process. Receptors carrying the Tyr-62 mutations retained the ability to be desensitized upon prolonged exposure to agonists but with slightly altered concentration dependence compared with the wild type. At low GABA concentrations (1–10 μm), the Y62S mutant receptor displayed the unusual property of first becoming desensitized but then recovering from desensitization despite the continued presence of agonist. Thus, under these conditions, this receptor (which lacks measurable high affinity agonist-binding sites) seems to be unable to maintain the desensitized state. Therefore, we propose a new model in which the role of the high affinity sites is not to induce desensitization but rather to stabilize the desensitized state once it has been formed. GABAAR β2 subunit mutants were engineered using the Altered Sites II® in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (10Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Mol. Biotech. 2000; 14: 25-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Xenopusoocytes were prepared as described (16Belleli D. Callachan H. Hill-Venning C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Capped cRNA transcripts for GABAAR subunits were prepared from cDNA constructs that were generous gifts from Dr. David Weiss. Oocytes were injected with α1, β2 (or β2 mutants), and γ2L subunit cRNA (1 μg/μl total RNA) in a 1:1:1 ratio in a total volume of 50 nl. Individual oocytes were maintained in 96-well plates at 14 °C in modified Barth's medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmCa(NO3)2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) that was supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Electrophysiological experiments were performed 2–7 days following oocyte injection. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp techniques were carried out using a GeneClamp 500B Amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.) at a holding potential of −60 mV. The microelectrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–2.0 megohms in frog Ringer's medium (120 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). In all experiments, oocytes were continuously bathed in frog Ringer's via a gravity perfusion system at a flow rate of ∼5 ml/min. GABA (Sigma) or muscimol (Sigma) was dissolved in the same medium. The current amplitude elicited by a 30-s application of a saturating concentration of GABA (1 mm) was first stabilized prior to experiments such that a maximum variation of 5% was observed over three successive applications. In desensitization experiments, changes in the current amplitudes elicited by challenge applications of GABA (1 mm) or muscimol (2 mm), i.e.concentrations that elicited a maximal response in all recombinant receptors, were measured. Bath pre-perfusion with lower concentrations of agonist was started after recovery of receptors from the desensitization induced by the challenge application itself. The relative current amplitude used in determination of IC50values for desensitization was defined by the steady state current (I) that was achieved in the presence of the indicated concentration of agonist in the pre-perfusate (see example in Fig. 1). Data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting using Equation 1 (GraphPad Prism Software) as follows: I=Imax/(1+(IC50/[A])n)(Eq. 1) where I is the peak amplitude of the current elicited by a given concentration of agonist ([A]); Imax is the maximum amplitude of the current; IC50 is the concentration required for half-maximal inhibition; and n is the Hill coefficient. The normalized data are presented as percent control to construct concentration-response curves. The assay protocols were optimized to ensure that any observed desensitization was due only to the presence of agonist in the bathing medium and not to other variables. In experiments to measure the effects of frequency of challenge and duration of pre-perfusion on current amplitude, desensitizing GABA concentrations equivalent to their IC50values (determined as above) were used in the pre-perfusion. Where noted in the text, pre-perfusion was started either after washout of the challenge concentration or immediately during the recovery phase from the agonist challenge. Both pre-perfusion protocols gave the same maximum depression of current amplitude under steady state conditions. The rate of recovery from desensitization was measured by first applying a desensitizing concentration of GABA (its Emax or EC50 concentration as noted) and then monitoring the magnitude of the peak current elicited by the same concentration of GABA administered at different time intervals (1–30 min) after the initial challenge. The recovery of the current amplitude as a function of time was fit by a single exponential model (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA; www.graphpad.com) to give estimates of the rate and extent of recovery. Similar experiments were carried out in the presence of bath-perfused GABA (3 μm) to assess the effects of pre-perfusion on the recovery from desensitization. Data were fitted to Equation 2, Recovery=Y0+YR(1−exp(−k*t))(Eq. 2) where YO represents the base-line response to GABA; YR is recovery; kis the rate of recovery; and t is the time. Data were analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance followed by either a post hoc Dunnett's test or Newman-Keuls to determine levels of significance. The data for GABA-mediated current shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were analyzed by a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance to compare the current before and after bath pre-perfusion of the indicated concentration of GABA.FIG. 3Experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 2 were carried out using recombinant GABAARs containing the Y62F (A) and Y62S (B) β2 subunits. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of 3 (Y62F) or 4 (Y62S) independent experiments. Following the third application (*) of GABA, the agonist was pre-perfused at concentrations of 5 and 25 μm,respectively (approximating their IC50 values for desensitization), to examine the effects of time (3 (▪), 6 (○), 9 (♦), and 12 min (■)) on functional recovery of the response from the challenge concentration. Inhibition of GABA-evoked current is significantly depressed during perfusion of agonist, and the Y62S mutant receptor shows accelerated recovery from desensitization induced by the challenge dose itself (see text for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 1A shows representative two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from recombinant wild-type α1β2γ2L receptors expressed inXenopus oocytes. In this experiment, maximally effective concentrations of GABA (1 mm) elicited rapidly desensitizing currents that were reproducible in amplitude when applied at 12-min intervals (Fig. 1; see below). We have previously reported that the EC50 for GABA-activated currents in this receptor subtype is ∼33 μm (10Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After the challenge applications, the oocyte was washed with Ringer's solution for 12 min (to allow recovery from the desensitization induced by the challenge) and then continuously bath-perfused with 10 μm GABA, a concentration which itself evokes a significant current response (<15% of maximum). Subsequent challenges at 12-min intervals showed that the amplitudes of the evoked currents were reduced, declined to steady state levels, and were fully reversible upon washout of GABA from the perfusate. We interpret the observed reduction in current as receptor desensitization induced by GABA in the perfusion medium. Fig. 1B shows the effects of bath perfusion of a lower concentration of GABA (1 μm) which by itself induces only a minimal chloride conductance (<2% of maximum). In contrast to the results in Fig. 1A, there was no diminution of the response to the first GABA challenge; rather a small, but reproducible, increase in the current amplitude was observed. However, upon repeated challenges, the current again declined to a steady state level, and this was fully reversible upon removal of GABA from the perfusate. These data suggest that channel activation may be required before the receptor can desensitize and, furthermore, that the extent of desensitization is dependent on the number of activations (see also Ref. 17Bartrup J.T. Newberry N.R J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 490: 679-690Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Comparison of the data in Fig. 1, A and B, demonstrates that the magnitude of steady state desensitization is also dependent upon the concentration of GABA in the perfusion medium (see below and Fig. 4). The experimental protocol used here to study GABAAreceptor desensitization was adapted from that of Bartrup and Newberry (17Bartrup J.T. Newberry N.R J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 490: 679-690Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) who used whole cell patch clamp techniques to study agonist-induced desensitization of the serotonin type 3 receptor in NG108-15 cells. Because GABAA receptor desensitization has not been quantified previously using the Xenopus oocyte system, we have optimized the experimental procedures to ensure that any desensitization observed was due to the presence of agonist in the perfusate and was not affected by other experimental variables. The data in Fig.2A illustrate the time interval between challenges required to avoid frequency-dependent effects in the wild-type receptor. As in Fig. 1, currents to a maximally effective GABA concentration (1 mm) were recorded at regular time intervals, but in these experiments, this interval was varied between 3 and 12 min as indicated. After the third control challenge, the oocyte was perfused with 3 μm GABA, a concentration that approximates its IC50 for desensitization (see below). Responses to subsequent regular challenges continued to be recorded prior to washout of GABA from the perfusate. In these experiments, perfusion with the lower concentration of GABA was started during the recovery phase from the challenge application, i.e. immediately after receptor activation. Under these conditions, there was an immediate reduction in the current amplitude to the next challenge (cf. Fig.1B), again demonstrating the activation dependence of this phenomenon (see below and also Ref. 17Bartrup J.T. Newberry N.R J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 490: 679-690Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As noted under “Experimental Procedures,” both preperfusion protocols gave the same steady state levels of desensitization. By using a 9- or 12-min interval between challenges, the control responses were reproducible in amplitude, and there was no difference in the magnitude of the inhibition observed during agonist perfusion or in the recovery upon washout (Fig. 2A). A 3-min interval is clearly not suitable for measuring the concentration dependence of desensitization, because the receptor is unable to recover from the desensitization induced by the challenge itself. This is shown by the decrease in the amplitudes of successive control currents prior to inclusion of the lower concentration of GABA in the bath. By using a 6-min interval, there were apparent frequency-dependent effects on washout, i.e. the current did not immediately return to control levels. Similar control experiments have been carried out using muscimol (data not shown). In all cases, a 12-min interval between challenges gave rise to reproducible effects in which the apparent desensitization depends only on the presence of agonist in the perfusion medium and on the number (see e.g. Fig.1B) but not on the frequency of channel activations. The effects of the time of pre-perfusion were also investigated. Fig. 2B shows representative experiments using wild-type receptors. In these experiments, responses to 1 mm GABA were first stabilized; the oocytes were washed and then perfused with 3 μm GABA for different times prior to challenge. Increasing the pre-perfusion time from 1 to 12 min showed that the extent of current depression was dependent upon perfusion time, but there were no significant differences between 9 and 12 min, suggesting that desensitization reaches a steady state within 9 min. This also illustrates that unlike rapid application techniques (18Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1995; 15: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), gravity perfusion requires longer periods of equilibration to achieve a stabilized desensitized state, which is in good agreement with theoretical considerations of Edelstein et al. (19Edelstein S.J. Schaad O. Henry E. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. Biol. Cybern. 1996; 75: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 2 illustrate that a 12-min interval between challenges gives rise to reproducible measurements of desensitization induced by agonist in the pre-perfusate. Both mutant receptors desensitized upon bath perfusion with GABA as shown in Fig. 3. The data shown in this figure were obtained using perfusate GABA concentrations that approximated the IC50 value for desensitization for each receptor (see below). In receptors carrying the β2 subunit Y62F mutation, the desensitization characteristics measured in control experiments (Fig. 3A) were very similar to those of wild-type receptors. However, notable differences were observed using the Y62S mutant (Fig. 3B). For this receptor, few frequency-dependent effects were apparent using challenge intervals varying from 3 to 12 min. This indicates that this receptor recovers more quickly (within ∼3-min) from the desensitization induced by the challenge than does the wild-type receptor. Experiments similar to those illustrated in Fig. 1 were carried out to investigate the effects of agonist concentration on the steady state level of desensitization. Fig.4A shows the concentration dependence of both GABA- and muscimol-induced desensitization of the wild-type receptor, and curve fitting gave apparent IC50values of 3.3 and 0.7 μm, respectively (Table I). In direct binding studies using [3H]muscimol, we have reported that the wild-type receptor expressed in tsA201 cells has (at least) two classes of binding sites with affinities of about 8 nm and 0.43 μm (10Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the latter value is subject to error due to rapid ligand dissociation from lower affinity sites during binding assays (see Ref. 13Agey M.W. Dunn S.M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4200-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the apparent KD value for this population correlates well with the IC50 value for muscimol-induced desensitization. Our preliminary interpretation is that desensitization may be induced by occupancy of the lower affinity binding sites measured in radioligand binding studies.Table IEffects of β2 subunit mutations on the concentration dependence of desensitization for GABA and muscimol using recombinant α1β2γ2 GABAAR expressed in Xenopus oocytesβ2 subunitIC50 (μm ± S.E.)nHMutant, wild-typeGABAWild-type (6)3.3 ± 1.0−0.99 ± 0.161.0Y62F (4)8.2 ± 1.11-ap < 0.05.−1.05 ± 0.072.5Y62S (3)24.7 ± 5.71-bp < 001.−1.03 ± 0.057.5MuscimolWild-type (3)0.7 ± 0.01−0.77 ± 0.081.0Y62F (3)2.1 ± 0.31-ap < 0.05.−0.86 ± 0.073.2Y62S (3)3.8 ± 0.51-bp < 001.−1.32 ± 0.345.71-a p < 0.05.1-b p < 001. Open table in a new tab The Y62F (Fig. 4B) and Y62S (Fig. 4C) mutations altered the concentration dependence for both GABA and muscimol-induced desensitization, the effects being greater in the case of the Y62S substitution (Table I). In both cases, muscimol was more potent than GABA in inducing desensitization. We have reported previously (10Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that muscimol is also more potent in activation of these mutant receptors. During the course of the above experiments, we observed several curious properties relating to the time dependence of desensitization of the Y62S mutant receptor. When the receptor was perfused with low concentrations of GABA (≤10 μm), i.e. below its IC50 for steady state desensitization, the receptor appeared to desensitize and then recover from this desensitization even in the continued presence of the perfused agonist. The representative traces in Fig. 5 illustrate this phenomenon. In these experiments, the wild-type (Fig. 5A) or Y62S (Fig. 5B) receptors were challenged successively with concentrations of GABA equivalent to their EC50 values for activation (see Table I). In control experiments, we have shown that the steady state level of desensitization is independent of whether the EC50 (used in Fig. 5) or Emax (as in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4) concentration of agonist is used as the challenge application (data not shown). When the wild-type receptor was perfused with 3 μm GABA, the currents, as expected from the previous results, declined to a steady state level and returned to control values upon washout. In contrast, the Y62S mutant receptor showed desensitization during the pre-perfusion, but rather than reaching a steady state residual current, the currents began to grow again even in the continued presence of 3 μm GABA in the perfusate. Thus this receptor, which we have shown previously to lack measurable high affinity binding sites (10Newell J.G. Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14198-14204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), appears unable to maintain the desensitized state. Fig. 6 quantifies this recovery phenomenon when the GABA concentration in the perfusate was increased to 10 μm. In the wild type (Fig.6A), the receptor desensitized, and this state was maintained until washout of the GABA from the perfusate. In contrast, the Y62S mutant desensitized but then recovered to control values in the continued presence of perfused GABA (Fig. 6B). The recovery phenomenon in the mutant is concentration-dependent. Although it is clear at low perfusate concentrations, i.e. 3–10 μm (Figs. 5 and 6), it is less obvious at higher concentrations. This is discussed further below.FIG. 6Desensitization of wild-type (A) and Y62S (B) mutant receptors in response to bath-perfused GABA (10 μm). Experiments were carried out as in Fig. 5. After stabilization of the current to the control challenge, the magnitude of the current was measured after maximum desensitization (seen on challenge after the second 9-min application). This is referred to as an amplitude of 1.0, and the magnitude of all other currents is normalized to this current. The amplitude of the current was measured in response to challenges applied after additional perfusion times of 12, 15, and 20 min, and after a 20-min washout period with frog Ringer solution. In wild-type receptors, there is no recovery of IGABA during continuous agonist perfusion. However, receptors expressing Y62S recover to control levels as a function of time even in the presence of GABA. The asterisksdenote currents that are not significantly different from control values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To define further the recovery of GABAARs from desensitization, we have investigated the rate and extent of recovery using wild-type and mutant Y62S receptors. In these experiments, a desensitizing concentration of GABA was applied, and the amplitude of the peak current to a subsequent challenge administered at times varying from 1 to 30 min after the initial application was measured. Fig. 7 shows the complete recovery from desensitization of wild-type (Fig 7A) and mutant (Fig.7B) receptors from successive challenges at their respective EC50 concentrations. The Y62S mutant receptor recovers ∼2-fold faster than the wild type, and curve fitting by a single exponential model (Table II) gave half-times for recovery of 0.8 and 1.5 min, respectively. These results are in agreement with the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3, which show that the mutant receptor recovers more quickly from desensitization induced by the challenge application.Table IIRates of recovery for recombinant GABAAR receptors carrying either the wild-type or mutant β2 subunits when expressed in Xenopus oocytes[GABA challenge]k % min−1 ± S.E.Ymax % ± S.E.α1β2γ2LEC50(3)47.3 ± 4.796.2 ± 2.5EC50 + 3 μm GABA perfusion (3)63.6 ± 8.364.2 ± 1.72-ap < 0.001.α1β2(Y62S)γ2LEC50(3)84.1 ± 9.298.8 ± 1.9EC50 + 3 μm GABA perfusion (3)20.3 ± 2.42-bp < 0.01.92.9 ± 3.42-a p < 0.001.2-b p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Similar experiments were carried out in the presence of 3 μm bath-perfused GABA, i.e. similar to the conditions used in Fig. 5. In the case of wild-type receptors, 3 μm GABA did not significantly alter the rate of recovery, but at longer time intervals, the current induced by the challenge application was reduced, reflecting the ability of the bath perfused GABA to “lock” a proportion of the receptors in a desensitized state. As expected from the previous results, the Y62S mutant receptor displayed different recovery properties (Fig. 7B). The receptor initially desensitized, but despite the continued presence of bath-perfused GABA (3 μm), the magnitude of the currents returned to control levels (Fig 7B) within about 20 min. This again demonstrates that low concentrations of GABA in the perfusate are able to induce desensitization but are unable to maintain the receptor in a desensitized state. First impressions of the data in Fig. 7B suggest that the rate of recovery may be slowed in the presence of GABA in the perfusate. However, this is unlikely to be due to a di"

The N-terminal domain, containing the catalytic and calmodulin-binding domains, is joined to a large RTX (repeats intoxin) domain for membrane translocation (3Coote J.G. FEMS Microbiol.

Immunological evidence indicates that the catalytic domain may be of eukaryotic origin (5Monneron A. Ladant D. d'Alayer J. Bellalou J. Barzu O. Ullman A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but the calmodulin binding domain is bipartite and does not resemble classical calmodulin target sites very closely (6Ladant D.

CyaA, and the related edema factor from Bacillus anthracis, are among the most active adenylate cyclases yet characterized and show the largest known responses to calmodulin (4Glaser P.

CyaA is therefore ideal for evaluating new strategies for assay of adenylate cyclase and calmodulin and calmodulin antagonists (9Goldhammer A.R. Wolff J. Anal.

The fact that the catalytic reaction generates pyrophosphate as a second product has attracted little attention, but offers the possibility of assay by coupled detection of pyrophosphate cleavage; this could, in principle, enable continuous assays to be devised for many other important enzymes.Radiochemical assays for nucleotide cyclases (10Salomon Y.

The aim here was to set up a simple rapid continuous recording method based on conductimetric determination of pyrophosphate cleavage (12Lawrence A.J. Maclean A. Young J. Stevenson R. Biochem. Educ. 1998; 26: 56-62Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) to be readily available for quality control and routine monitoring and which might be useful for assaying calmodulin and its inhibitors. However, the first application of the new method revealed time-dependent features of the kinetics for reactions initiated by addition of calmodulin and drew attention to problems of reaction rate determination at low protein concentration, which had not previously been addressed. Development of the assay method allowed the resolution of various questions relating to the effects of low concentrations of activator.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and PlasmidsAdenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) was produced as a recombinant form after overexpression in Escherichia coli. E. coli BL21/DE3 (F− ompT rB− mB−) was used as host strain for production of recombinant proteins. The CyaA pro-toxin, which has adenylate cyclase enzymic activity, and the CyaC protein required for post-translational acylation and activation of cytotoxic activity were expressed from separate compatible plasmids, pGW44 and pGW54, respectively, each under the control of the inducible T7 RNA polymerase promoter (13Westrop G.D.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Preparation of Adenylate CyclaseRecombinant CyaA proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies inE. coli and extracts of these were prepared in 8m urea as described previously (13Westrop G.D. Hormozi E.K. da Costa N.A. Coote J.G. Parton R. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzyme in the unpurified extract (specific activity in the radiochemical assay ≈100 I.U. per mg of protein (13Westrop G.D. Hormozi E.K. da Costa N.A. Coote J.G. Parton R. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) was purified by anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (14Sakamoto H. Bellalou J. Sebo P. Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13598-13602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), giving a single major band on SDS-PAGE (molecular mass 200kDa) with a specific activity of 600 I.U. per mg of protein (15Hormozi E.K. Parton R. Coote J. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 23: 273-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), comparable with that of a similar preparation described elsewhere (16Hewlett E.L. Gordon V.G. McCaffery J.D. Sutherland W.M. Gray M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19379-19384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time-dependent phenomena described in this paper were observed with both purified and unpurified enzyme preparations.ConductimetryApparatusThis was an eight-cell system (12Lawrence A.J. Maclean A. Young J. Stevenson R. Biochem. Educ. 1998; 26: 56-62Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 17Mezna M. Lawrence A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) modified for control from a PC serial port with automatic balancing and calibration. The sampling period is 1 s per cell, cycling through from one to eight cells. Incomplete assay mixtures (normally 2 ml) reached thermal equilibrium in a period <2 min, and reaction was initiated by addition of up to 20 μl of either enzyme, substrate, or activator. The effects of addition were tested by controls in which the initiating reagent was added to an incomplete reaction mixture in synchrony with the test addition to permit valid blank subtraction. Data processing included blank subtraction, on-screen line drawing routines to measure curve slopes and total changes, and the export of standard format data files.ReagentsInorganic pyrophosphatase from E. coli(Sigma) was dissolved in water at 500 IU per ml (where 1 IU hydrolyzes 1 μmol/min), stored at −20 °C, and thawed and refrozen repeatedly without noticeable loss of activity. Typically, 0.5 IU was used in each assay. Calmodulin was purified from porcine testicular tissue (17Mezna M. Lawrence A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), made up as a stock solution of 7.5 mg/ml in water, and stored at −20 °C.Assay MethodsThe assay buffer was 10 mmBicine/Na+, pH 8.0, with either 1.5 or 2.5 mmMgCl2 degassed on the day of use by heating to >90 °C and exposing to reduced pressure to promote vigorous boiling for > 2 s (18Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). ATP or other potentially unstable reagents were added to the bulk cooled buffer and dispensed in 2-ml aliquots. Where used, CaCl2 or EGTA was included in the assay buffer.CalibrationSolution conductance has a near-linear relationship to concentration for small concentration changes (<5%) (19Lawrence A.J. Moores G.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 24: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because pyrophosphate hydrolysis is effectively irreversible, reactions linked to it become irreversible, and conductance change can then be calibrated in terms of substrate conversion (rather than specific product formation). Changes were determined in arbitrary “local” units for notional conversion of 1 mmsubstrate. Total conductance changes and tangents to curves are measured by an on-screen line drawing routine (12Lawrence A.J. Maclean A. Young J. Stevenson R. Biochem. Educ. 1998; 26: 56-62Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Thus for a substrate concentration of 1 mm giving a total change ofx units and an initial slope of y units per minute, the initial rate is: initial rate = (y/x) μmol/ml/min, which could be used as an internal instrument calibration to display reaction rates in international units.Blank SubtractionThe addition of highly conductive solutions to the conductivity cells causes an initial incremental change in conductance, which stabilizes within 10–20 s, but partially masks the continuous change caused by the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The effect can be almost completely (>95%) abolished by addition of the same reagent to two cells and using one as a blank with the blank subtraction procedure. Because cell recordings are made at 1-s intervals, it is possible to add the reagent sequentially to all cells during at most two recording cycles so that a single blank cell can be used for seven reaction cells.Lag Phase KineticsThe half-time for the duration of lag phases in reaction progress curves was determined by estimating the time at which the tangent to the rate curve reached half its final value. The relaxation time (τ) was calculated from the relationship τ = t 12/lne2.DISCUSSIONThe pyrophosphatase-coupled conductimetric assay for the adenylate cyclase activity of CyaA has been used extensively in our laboratory since its initial development. It offers a large number of practical advantages over the radiochemical methods. Indeed, the only real advantage of the latter is that a lower limit of detection can be achieved, which in practice is rarely required. The obvious benefits of the conductimetric method are in terms of safety, cost, and the ease of data handling, but the greatest advantages are that assays are both simple and rapid and can be available whenever required, for example to monitor the individual steps during a purification procedure. Scientifically, the most useful feature of the methods is the time resolution, which has enabled valuable information to be obtained by analysis of the shapes of reaction progress curves.A number of features of the coupled assay should be noted. First, the coupling enzyme (pyrophosphatase) of the required purity and activity is commercially available at reasonable cost. Second, the specific activity of purified CyaA determined by the coupled assay is very similar to that obtained using radiochemical assay method under the same assay conditions. Third, we have conclusively established that over the range of concentrations of CyaA assayed the coupling step is not rate-limiting. Finally, under any other assay conditions,e.g. in the presence of other metals, it is easy to confirm the validity of the coupled assay method.Conductimetric assays have a multitude of potential uses and provide a method of choice for very many enzymes (12Lawrence A.J. Maclean A. Young J. Stevenson R. Biochem. Educ. 1998; 26: 56-62Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 17Mezna M. Lawrence A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Lawrence A.J. Moores G.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 24: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Besson C. Vessillier S. Gonzales T. Saulnier J. Wallach J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1994; 294: 305-309Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However one enzyme for which this assay method is outstandingly suitable is inorganic pyrophosphatase, where the extension to coupled detection methods has wide ramifications. Condensation reactions in which pyrophosphate is released fall into two classes: those in which a mononucleotide is added to a substrate molecule (e.g. DNA and RNA polymerases) and those in which a so-called high energy intermediate is generated (e.g. aminoacyl-tRNA ligases andS-adenosylmethionine synthetase). In all cases the condensation reactions have low free energy changes and are driven to near-completion by the special conditions operating within the cell. One of these conditions is the biological instability of inorganic pyrophosphate. This molecule is in fact kinetically highly stable, but in the presence of magnesium it is the target for high affinity cytosolic pyrophosphatases. Thus the coupling of pyrophosphate hydrolysis to a suitable detection method provides an assay for the parent enzymes that closely matches the biological function. No problems were encountered in setting up the linked assay for adenylate cyclase, because the kinetic characteristics of inorganic pyrophosphatases make them adaptable to a wide variety of conditions; it is therefore likely that this would be true for most other possible pyrophosphatase-linked assays.The results of this study allow us to present a simple model for the behavior of the CyaA-calmodulin complex. The relatively good agreement between kinetic parameters determined by conventional activity measurements and lag phase analysis and those determined directly from the rates of dissociation indicates that the reaction between CyaA and calmodulin is effectively collision-limited at the protein concentrations used in these (and previous) assays.We have generated the CyaA-calmodulin complex in the presence or the absence of calcium and have shown that both have similar activity at 30 °C, but the former is considerably more active at 37 °C, and this has enabled us to compare the dissociation properties of the two complexes. Our data show that removal of calcium from the medium, which decreases the collision efficiency for reaction between CyaA and calmodulin by more than 30-fold, has no effect on the dissociation rate. The data indicate that the activity of the complexes is determined by a balance between the intrinsic activity and inhibition by a freely exchangeable ion acting outside the calmodulin binding site. In the absence of any indication of inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline-sensitive ions, we assume that the inhibitor is calcium itself, because the calcium inhibition curve (Fig.2 c) climbs sharply as it approaches zero concentration, conditions only found in assays of calcium-containing complexes in a calcium-free medium.In contrast to the unexpected absence of any effect of calcium on the dissociation of the CyaA-calmodulin complex, calcium increases the rate of complex formation >30-fold, which is almost adequate to account for the effect on the apparent binding affinity. In view of the large changes in conformation and properties induced by the binding of calcium to calmodulin, this would appear to be a comparatively small effect on the rate of a collision-limited process. The observations can be rationalized by postulating that the primary interaction of calmodulin with CyaA is made by a part of calmodulin that is not greatly affected by calcium binding and that subsequent exploratory conformational changes take place on a time scale that is very much shorter than the time resolution of these experiments. The affinity of CyaA for calmodulin, even in the absence of free calcium, is such that at concentrations in the order of 10 μm found in eukaryotic cell cytosol (9Goldhammer A.R. Wolff J. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 124: 45-52Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) activation would be rapid and complete.It should be noted that CyaA has many potential analytical uses, which could be exploited by the coupled assay method; these include the determination of calmodulin or calmodulin inhibitors and screening procedures for mutants containing cyaA′ translational fusions. Although the latter approach has been developed to identify genes encoding surface-exposed and secreted proteins inBordetella bronchiseptica (29Tu X. Nisan I. Miller J.F. Hanski E. Rosenshine I. FEMS Microbiol. Letts. 2001; 205: 119-123PubMed Google Scholar), the authors comment that its usefulness is limited by the difficulties posed by the conventional radiochemical assay. Our assay method should be of value in this regard. The catalytic and regulatory properties of CyaA reside in the N-terminal domain (4Glaser P. Elmaoglou-Lazaridou A. Krin E. Ladant D. Barzu O. Danchin A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), while those that contribute to its limited solubility (and hence instability) in aqueous solutions almost certainly reside in the C-terminal domain. Thus, it is probable that the practical utility and mechanistic studies of the system could be greatly increased by use of a truncated N-terminal (and hence presumably water-soluble) protein. This represents a goal for future research. It should be noted that in the case of the edema factor fromBacillus anthracis, the adenylate cyclase activity resides in the C-terminal portion of the exotoxin. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the edema factor in the absence and presence of CaM have given valuable insights into the mechanism of the activation process (8Drum C.L. Yan S.-Z. Bard J.

Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). ATP or other potentially unstable reagents were added to the bulk cooled buffer and dispensed in 2-ml aliquots. Where used, CaCl2 or EGTA was included in the assay buffer.CalibrationSolution conductance has a near-linear relationship to concentration for small concentration changes (<5%) (19Lawrence A.J. Moores G.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 24: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because pyrophosphate hydrolysis is effectively irreversible, reactions linked to it become irreversible, and conductance change can then be calibrated in terms of substrate conversion (rather than specific product formation). Changes were determined in arbitrary “local” units for notional conversion of 1 mmsubstrate. Total conductance changes and tangents to curves are measured by an on-screen line drawing routine (12Lawrence A.J. Maclean A. Young J. Stevenson R. Biochem. Educ. 1998; 26: 56-62Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Thus for a substrate concentration of 1 mm giving a total change ofx units and an initial slope of y units per minute, the initial rate is: initial rate = (y/x) μmol/ml/min, which could be used as an internal instrument calibration to display reaction rates in international units.Blank SubtractionThe addition of highly conductive solutions to the conductivity cells causes an initial incremental change in conductance, which stabilizes within 10–20 s, but partially masks the continuous change caused by the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The effect can be almost completely (>95%) abolished by addition of the same reagent to two cells and using one as a blank with the blank subtraction procedure. Because cell recordings are made at 1-s intervals, it is possible to add the reagent sequentially to all cells during at most two recording cycles so that a single blank cell can be used for seven reaction cells.Lag Phase KineticsThe half-time for the duration of lag phases in reaction progress curves was determined by estimating the time at which the tangent to the rate curve reached half its final value. The relaxation time (τ) was calculated from the relationship τ = t 12/lne2. Bacterial Strains and PlasmidsAdenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) was produced as a recombinant form after overexpression in Escherichia coli. E. coli BL21/DE3 (F− ompT rB− mB−) was used as host strain for production of recombinant proteins. The CyaA pro-toxin, which has adenylate cyclase enzymic activity, and the CyaC"
