https://openalex.org/W2027602831,"Rhenium and osmium concentrations and Os isotopic compositions of eight carbonaceous chondrites, one LL3 ordinary chondrite, and two iron meteorites were determined by resonance ionization mass spectrometry. Iron meteorite (187)Re/(186)Os and (l87)Os/(l86)Os ratios plot on the previously determined iron meteorite isochron, but most chondrite data plot 1 to 2 percent above this meteorite isochron. This suggests either that irons have significantly younger Re-Os closure ages than chondrites or that chondrites were formed from precursor materials with different chemical histories from the precursors of irons. Some samples of Semarkona (LL3) and Murray (C2M) meteorites plot 4 to 6 percent above the iron meteorite isochron, well above the field delineated by other chondrites. Murray may have lost Re by aqueous leaching during its preterrestrial history. Semarkona could have experienced a similar loss of Re, but only slight aqueous alteration is evident in the meteorite. Therefore, the isotopic composition of Semarkona could reflect assembly of isotopically heterogeneous components subsequent to 4.55 billion years ago or Os isotopic heterogeneities in the primordial solar nebula."

Deep-tow high-resolution imagery shows that the crater is cut into a low hill surrounded by near-surface concentric faults. Approximately 2 million cubic meters of ejected sediment forms a peripheral debris field. The low hill and faults may be related to mud diapirism or intrusion of gas hydrates into near-surface sediments. A recent eruption evacuated sediments from the crater, apparently because of release of overpressured petrogenic gas."
https://openalex.org/W2047125841,Phosphate uptake in the obligately marine fungus Thraustochytrium roseum is maximally stimulated by sodium chloride in a range of concentrations (0.2 to 0.4 molar) similar to those commonly encountered in littoral habitats. The effectiveness of sodium chloride for phosphate transport extends beyond its osmotic function and can be attributed specifically to sodium. Increases in respiration in the presence of the salt can be ascribed primarily to an osmotic effect.

At a relatively constant distance of 4500 to 4900 kilometers west of the crest of the East Pacific Rise and of its projection through North America, the typically straight and simple fracture zones branch and become more complex. However, the Clipperton fracture zone, including one branch, follows a great circle for almost 10,000 kilometers, a quarter of Earth's circumference."
https://openalex.org/W2088760760,"Orbiter photographs of the wall of a large circular formation on the moon show that the wall is a convex body resembling a flow of viscous lava. The slopes are less than the angle of repose of dry rock; hence an explanation in terms of mass wastage is hard to support. The viscosity is approximately 10(13) centimeter-gram- second units, indicating an acid lava."

https://openalex.org/W2014681846,"Exchange between calcium from montmorillonite and hydrogen from resin is much slower than exchange between sodium from montmorillonite and hydrogen from resin. Film kinetics are prevailing in both cases, but the location of the rate-determining step is shifted from the Nernst films of the resin particles in the sodium-hydrogen exchange to the Nernst films of the clay particles in the calcium-hydrogen exchange. The increased particle size of the montmorillonite in the calcium state, caused by tactoid formation, appears to be the main reason for the shift."
https://openalex.org/W2015425123,"Recently, a strong research effort has been focused on applications of beat waves in plasma interactions. This research has important implications for various aspects of plasma physics and plasma technology. This article reviews the present status of the field and comments on plasma probing, heating of magnetically confined and laser plasmas, ionospheric plasma modification, beat-wave particle acceleration, beat-wave current drive in toroidal devices, beat wave-driven free-electron lasers, and phase conjugation with beat waves."

https://openalex.org/W4232067268,"The fungicidal activity, mammalian toxicity, and methods of synthesis of phthalimidophosphonothionates, a novel type of organophosphoramide compound, have been investigated. The findings led to development of the compound diethyl phthalimidophosphonothionate as a new bioproduct. This diester protects a variety of crops from certain plant diseases, such as powdery mildew, apple scab, leaf spot, brown rot, and black spot."
https://openalex.org/W2023055423,"Crystals of a fibrous phase of sulfur-selenium obtained at 20 kilobars and 280 degrees C are trigonal, the most probable space groups being P3(1) and P3(2,) with a = 7.85, c = 4.62 +/- 0.01 A. The unit cell contains nine atoms, and the measured density of 3.20 g/cm(3) implies five sulfur and four Se atoms. The structure contains mixed atom helices of 1.54 A pitch and 0.91 A average radius."
https://openalex.org/W2065458029,"Data from two Lunar Orbiter spacecraft have been used to test the significance of corrections to the lunar ephemeris. Range residuals of up to 1700 meters were reduced by an order of magnitude by application of the corrections, with most of the residuals reduced to less than 100 meters. Removal of gross errors in the ephemeris reveals residual patterns that may indicate errors in location of observing stations, as well as the expected effects of Lunar nonsphericity."

https://openalex.org/W1978075684,"If you are looking for a coherent, tidily packaged program, do not bother with the meetings of the American Geophysics Union. Its name suggests at least certain constraints, but in practice there are almost none. This past December's meeting was typical: it included anything natural and nonliving within the gravitational influence of the sun. For good measure the marine biology of the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography was thrown in as well. Here are some selections."

https://openalex.org/W2042396952,"A recent suggestion by G. Chen and W. A. Goddard (1) for electron pairing in high temperature superconducting oxides reintroduced the concept of magnon exchange as a replacement for the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phonon exchange (2). This suggestion received considerable attention because [on the basis of microscopic
calculations (1, 3) for small clusters] it provided precise estimates of the various superconducting transition temperatures T_c in the cuprate ceramics and calculated an
upper bound T^(max)_c = 232 K. We show that, within the Chen-Goddard mechanism, the estimates of T_c are incorrect because Chen and Goddard use an equation for T_c appropriate only for weak coupling and that their T^(max)_c is spurious, as there is no upper bound when the correct expression is used."

https://openalex.org/W2065444143,"The annual meeting of the AAAS, held in San Francisco on 14 to 19 January, attracted the largest turnout for several years. More than 6000 are estimated to have attended. The meeting, which was held in conjunction with the winter meeting of the American Physical Society and the annual meeting of the American Association of Physics Teachers, was reminiscent in some respects of the big AAAS annual gatherings of the late 1960s and early 1970sâ€”even down to the presence of demonstrators, this year from the animal rights movement. Some highlights of the more than 250 sessions:"
