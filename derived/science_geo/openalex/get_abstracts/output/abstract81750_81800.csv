https://openalex.org/W2071219626,"Glucocorticoids stimulate transcriptional initiation within integrated mammary tumor virus (MTV) DNA sequences in infected cells. We report here that production of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) RNA is stimulated as much as 50-fold by the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, when sequences from a particular region of MTV DNA are fused upstream of the normally constitutive tk promoter region. Three cloned fragments of MTV DNA were tested, each itself lacking the sequences required for transcription initiation. We monitored the effects of dexamethasone on the efficiency with which these recombinants transfect a tk- rat cell line to a tk+ phenotype, and measured tk enzymatic activity, the size and abundance of tk mRNA, and the 5' termini of tk transcripts in the transfectants. We conclude that the MTV promoter region contains a ""glucocorticoid response element"" that can be separated from a second element essential for MTV transcription initiation. The hormone response element maps within a 340-base pair MTV DNA fragment that contains specific binding sites for purified glucocorticoid receptor protein in vitro, implying that receptor binding at these sites in vivo may mediate hormone responsiveness. Comparison of several different constructions indicates that the location and orientation of the glucocorticoid response element relative to the transcription start site is not rigidly constrained."

https://openalex.org/W2058727554,"Heparin or a heparin fragment administered with cortisone inhibited angiogenesis, caused regression of large tumor masses, and prevented metastases. Oral administration of heparin resulted in the release of non-anticoagulant heparin fragments in the serum which, in the presence of cortisone, had similar anti-angiogenic and antitumor effects. Of all the heparin fragments tested, the most potent inhibition of angiogenesis in the presence of cortisone was provided by a hexasaccharide with a molecular weight of about 1600."
https://openalex.org/W1995478437,"The ability of purified U1 small nuclear RNA-protein complexes (U1 snRNPs) to bind in vitro to two RNAs transcribed from recombinant DNA clones by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase has been studied. A transcript which contains sequences corresponding to the small intron and flanking exons of the major mouse beta-globin gene is bound in marked preference to an RNA devoid of splice site sequences. The site of U1 snRNP binding to the globin RNA has been defined by T1 ribonuclease digestion of the RNA-U1 snRNP complex. A 15-17-nucleotide region, including the 5' splice site, remains undigested and complexed with the snRNP such that it can be co-precipitated by antibodies directed against the U1 snRNP. Partial proteinase K digestion of the U1 snRNP abolishes interaction with the globin RNA, indicating that the snRNP proteins contribute significantly to RNA binding. No RNA cleavage, splicing, or recognition of the 3' splice site by U1 snRNPs has been detected. Our results are discussed in terms of the probable role of U1 snRNPs in the messenger RNA splicing of eucaryotic cell nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1597666961,"A naturally occurring inducer of terminal differentiation in a murine myelomonocytic leukemia cell line (WEHI-3B) was purified to apparent homogeneity from medium conditioned by lungs from mice injected with bacterial endotoxin. The factor was purified over 400,000-fold by sequential fractionation using salting out chromatography, chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-60 in 1 M acetic acid, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a phenyl-silica column, and high performance liquid chromatography on a gel filtration column. During the first two steps, the differentiation-inducing factor was separated completely from a known proliferative regulator for normal myeloid cells, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, but it co-purified through all remaining steps with a distinct granulocyte-specific colony-stimulating factor. The purified factor showed a single protein band of Mr = 24,000-25,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels coincident with both differentiation-inducing and granulocyte colony-stimulating activity. The granulocyte-specific colony-stimulating factor was active on WEHI-3B cells and normal granulocytic progenitor cells in vitro at the same half-maximally active concentration of 3 X 10(-12) M."
https://openalex.org/W2034280067,"We show that two promoters of different strengths are involved in the tissue-specific expression of the alpha-amylase gene Amy-1a in the parotid gland and the liver of mouse. The weaker of the two promoters directs the synthesis of mRNA with a liver-type leader sequence. This promoter is active in both tissues. A promoter that is about 30-fold stronger is exclusively active in the parotid, where it directs the synthesis of an mRNA with a parotid-specific leader sequence. Neither the parotid nor the liver promoter is used in tissues that do not contain cytoplasmic alpha-amylase mRNAs, such as brain, kidney, and spleen. Nuclear transcripts that are initiated several kilobases upstream of the parotid cap site are detected in several tissues. They are most abundant in brain, and are apparently not processed into alpha-amylase mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1967197264,"One of the first steps in neovascularization is dissolution of the basement membrane at the point of endothelial outgrowth. An assay was developed to determine whether basement membrane collagens (types IV and V) are degraded by endothelial cells migrating toward a chemotactic stimulus. Fetal bovine endothelial cells were placed on one side of a filter containing the collagen substrate, and a chemoattractant derived from retinal extracts was placed on the opposite side. Degradation of both type IV and type V collagens was observed when the retinal factor was placed on the side of the filter opposite the endothelial cells. Metalloproteinases that cleaved type IV and type V collagens could be extracted from the endothelial cells with detergents. Such endothelial cell-associated (possibly membrane-bound) proteinases may locally disrupt the basement membrane and facilitate the outgrowth of capillary sprouts toward the angiogenic stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W2150180945,"We have tested a model for global ribosome biosynthesis by examining the effects of increased gene dosage on the synthesis of rRNA. Increasing gene dosage does not lead to a significant increase in total rRNA transcription; i.e., rRNA synthesis from individual rRNA operons is reduced to keep total rRNA production unchanged. In contrast, when the plasmid-encoded rRNA operons used to increase gene dosage contain deletions within the rRNA coding region, rRNA transcription is gene-dosage-dependent; i.e., rRNA regulation is relieved. We find that the syntheses of most, if not all, tRNAs are also subject to the same controls as rRNA transcription. We conclude that the production of functional rRNA is monitored by the regulatory system that controls rRNA and tRNA transcription. We propose that rRNA and tRNA are negatively controlled by products of rRNA operons and discuss evidence suggesting that ribosomes are the key element involved in the postulated feedback regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2020269400,"A model is presented according to which cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) DNA is replicated via an RNA intermediate. The model explains the typical S1 nuclease-sensitive sites in mature CaMV DNA, the occurrence of the large, terminally redundant transcript, the local separation of CaMV transcription and CaMV assembly, the abundance of knotted CaMV DNA forms, and the high recombination frequency. A site of perfect homology to plant tRNA was detected. Extracts from a mixture of nuclei and inclusion bodies can be separated into fast-sedimenting complexes elongating endogenous CaMV RNA, and slow-sedimenting ones elongating endogenous CaMV DNA. The CaMV DNA synthesis can be partly inhibited both by RNAase and actinomycin D, suggesting the presence of a mixture of RNA- and DNA-templates."
https://openalex.org/W1604499135,"Calcineurin, a calmodulin-binding protein from brain, has been shown to possess a metal ion-dependent and calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase activity towards phosphorylase kinase and inhibitor-1 (Stewart, A. A., Ingebritsen, T. S., Manalan, A., Klee, C. B., and Cohen, P. (1982) FEBS Lett. 137, 80-84). In this report, we show that calcineurin can also dephosphorylate p-nitrophenyl phosphate and free phosphotyrosine. However, calcineurin does not show significant activity towards phosphothreonine, phosphoserine, or several other low molecular weight phosphocompounds tested. As we have found with phosphorylase kinase and phosphocasein, the dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and free phosphotyrosine is stimulated by calmodulin and is metal ion-dependent with the order of efficiency being Mn2+ much greater than Co2+ greater than Ca2+. The dephosphorylation of these substrates appears to be an intrinsic property of calcineurin and is not due to contamination by alkaline phosphatases since the pH optimum for calcineurin activity occurs at a neutral rather than an alkaline pH. The dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate provides an easy, rapid, and accurate method for the quantification of calcineurin activity as well as permitting insight into reaction kinetics. The dephosphorylation of free phosphotyrosine by calcineurin suggests that this compound may be a physiological substrate of calcineurin."
https://openalex.org/W1546045554,"We have isolated a cDNA clone derived from poly(A+) RNA from barley aleurone cells stimulated with gibberellic acid. This cDNA clone contains one open reading frame coding for 438 amino acids. The cloned DNA hybridizes to a poly(A+) RNA species 1550 bases in size, the same size as the most abundant poly(A+) RNA molecules in stimulated cells. RNA complementary to this clone can be translated to make immunoprecipitable alpha-amylase in the wheat germ system and increases about 5-fold in quantity after gibberellic acid stimulation of aleurone cells. In contrast, hybridization experiments using a total cDNA probe demonstrate that the most abundant mRNA population, identical in size with our cloned sequence and presumably that for alpha-amylase, increases at least 17-fold after gibberellic acid stimulation. We therefore infer that there must be at least two populations of alpha-amylase mRNA molecules derived from separate structural genes differently influenced by gibberellic acid in aleurone cells."

https://openalex.org/W1599397384,"Simian virus 40-transformed 3T3 (SV-3T3) cells have been shown to possess on their surfaces binding sites for hyaluronate which mediate the divalent cation independent aggregation of these cells. To further characterize these binding sites, membranes were prepared from SV-3T3 cells and solubilized with the detergent, sodium deoxycholate. The binding activity present in the detergent solution was measured by the addition of [3H]hyaluronate followed by separation of free and bound ligand by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. Using this assay, the soluble hyaluronate-binding protein was compared with the membrane-associated protein in situ. In both cases, binding was found to be saturable, linear with protein content, competitively inhibited by unlabeled hyaluronate and dependent on a minimum of 6 sugar residues of hyaluronate for recognition. However, the solubilized binding protein was found to differ from the membrane-associated protein in the following characteristics: a) the affinity of the interaction with hyaluronate was reduced (the Kd was higher), while the amount of ligand bound at saturation (Bmax) was increased; b) in competition experiments with unlabeled preparations of hyaluronate, the effect that the MWv of the hyaluronate had on its inhibitory potency was greatly reduced; and c) the binding was inhibited to a greater extent by chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. All of these differences can be accounted for by assuming that the detergent solubilization changes the nature of the hyaluronate-binding site interaction from one that is multivalent (i.e. one molecule of hyaluronate is attached to several sites) to one that is monovalent."
https://openalex.org/W1522048024,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulated the phosphorylation of a 170,000-Mr protein in membranes prepared from parental and several variant lines of Swiss 3T3 cells as well as from diploid human fibroblasts. The intensity of the phosphorylation of the 170,000-Mr protein paralleled the number of PDGF receptors present on the various cells. The enhanced phosphorylation was the result of an increase in the amount of phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine present in the 170,000-Mr protein. PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the 170,000-Mr protein was rapid and showed a dose response to PDGF. Down regulation of the PDGF receptor led to a rapid loss in the PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the 170,000-Mr protein. In Swiss 3T3 cell membranes, PDGF as well as epidermal growth factor stimulated the phosphorylation of a synthetic, tyrosine-containing peptide. The effects of the two growth factors were additive, indicating that PDGF and epidermal growth factor stimulate peptide phosphorylation through distinct receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1972491389,"We investigated soybean lectin gene structure and expression in a genetic line that accumulates normal levels of seed lectin (Le+ line) and in a mutant line that produces no detectable seed lectin (Le- line). We found that the nuclear and cytoplasmic lectin RNA levels in Le- embryos are approximately 0.01% of those in Le+ embryos. Runoff transcription experiments with isolated nuclei showed that the reduced RNA levels are caused by decreased lectin gene transcription. Each genetic line contains two lectin genes, L1 and L2. L1 encodes seed lectin, while the function of L2 is unknown. We found that a 3.4 kb DNA segment, consisting of repeated sequences, has been inserted into the L1 gene of the Le- line. We conclude that this insertion results in reduced transcription of the mutant L1 gene, and leads to the lectinless phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1971140410,"Chicken cerebellum expresses a polypeptide antigenically and biochemically related to the alpha subunit of spectrin, an erythrocyte membrane-cytoskeletal protein. Most of this polypeptide is associated with a brain specific spectrin subunit, gamma-spectrin, and is localized in virtually all neuronal cell bodies and processes. Cerebellum also expresses polypeptides antigenically related to the beta subunits of erythrocyte spectrin and these are also found in association with cerebellar alpha-spectrin but are confined to the plasmalemma of the neuronal cell bodies. This suggests that there is a mechanism for segregating different spectrin complexes into distinct membrane domains within a single cell."

https://openalex.org/W144939835,"We have isolated and characterized in detail 15 lambda Charon 4A recombinant bacteriophage containing histone genes from a chicken genomic library. Restriction enzyme-mapping analysis and Southern hybridization to sequenced, homologous histone probes indicate that these genes are not tandemly reiterated within the chicken genome; they usually reside in clusters even though there is no unique array of genes that appears to constitute a typical cluster. Chicken H4 and H1 genes were identified within the genomic recombinants and subsequently sequenced. Extensive regions of homology exist in the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of the chicken H4 gene when compared to H4 genes from other organisms. In addition to the well documented histone-specific domains, two previously unreported regions of homology lie 5' to this gene: an octanucleotide and a pentanucleotide sequence lying 59 and 116 nucleotides upstream from the H4 gene CAP site, respectively. The H1 gene sequence predicts that the H1 polypeptide is 217 amino acids in length. The 5'-flanking domain of this gene contains, in addition to the transcriptional initiation site and the box, two unusual sequences: one is a nonamer which resides 29 nucleotides upstream from the ATA box and is conserved in both the chicken and sea urchin H1 genes, while the other is a GC-rich repetitive sequence element. The majority of the chicken histone genes among the 15 unique lambda recombinant clones are expressed almost exclusively during in ovo development (i.e. from at least 4 days postfertilization up to hatching, about 20-21 days postfertilization) and appear not to be associated with any particular tissue type."
https://openalex.org/W2113228804,"Glycophorin A and B from Cad erythrocyte membranes are the carriers of the blood group Cad determinants. They are characterized by a significant increase in molecular mass, as compared to the corresponding glycophorins from control erythrocytes (Cartron, J.-P., and Blanchard, D. (1982) Biochem. J. 207, 497-504). Lipid-free glycophorin A, purified from Cad red cells, showed an increased GalNAc content in comparison to blood group B, Cad-negative, control cells. Alkaline-borohydride treatment of this Cad glycophorin A released as a predominant species a pentasaccharide; its structure was determined, by methylation analysis and by 500-MHz 1H-NMR studies, to be: (formula; see text) This novel oligosaccharide inhibited strongly the hemagglutination of Cad erythrocytes by the Dolichos biflorus lectin.

https://openalex.org/W1941328510,"We have studied the distribution of mass in several types of intermediate filaments (IF) assembled in vitro, by analyzing scanning transmission electron micrographs (STEM) of unstained specimens imaged in dark-field mode. Bovine epidermal keratin IF, which are obligate heteropolymers, were thus characterized and compared with facultative heteropolymers of vimentin and desmin and with earlier observations of homopolymer vimentin IF. The major components of each type of IF have linear densities of 37 kilodaltons/nm. Minor polymorphic variants are also present in each case, with linear densities of approximately 25 and 48 kilodaltons/nm, respectively. In view of the known subunit masses, these results are consistent with the proposition that at least three IF types (bovine epidermal keratin, vimentin, and desmin) are structurally homologous. For each type of IF studied, measurements taken near the ends of long IF or from short IF tend to have lower densities, characteristic of the least dense polymorphic variant. This form may represent a precursor core structure in the sense of a minimal aggregate of protofilaments sufficiently stable to permit elongation. In the course of in vitro assembly, this form would be maturable to the normal IF structure at 37 kilodaltons/nm by the accretion of further protein. We also find the projected widths of these IF as measured from the STEM images to be significantly greater than the corresponding diameters determined in previous studies by conventional electron microscopy. Whereas the conventional techniques have routinely yielded diameters of 7-11 nm for IF contrasted by heavy metal staining, the STEM images of unstained IF provide estimates of 15 +/- 1 nm for the outer diameter of the major density class for each IF type studied and average values of 13.8 and 16.1 nm for the less dense and more dense variants, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1548037071,"Confluent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts incubated for 72 h with methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin differentiate and acquire phenotypic characteristics of mature adipocytes, including hormone-sensitive cAMP phosphodiesterase activity located in a particulate fraction of homogenates. About 10 days after initiating differentiation, a maximally effective concentration of insulin (100 pM) increased particulate cAMP phosphodiesterase activity 40 to 60% in 8 min; activation persisted for at least 30 min in the presence of insulin. Incubation of adipocytes for 6-8 min with agents that increased cAMP, e.g. 1 microM epinephrine, 0.1 microM isoproterenol, corticotropin (2 mu units/ml), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (15 ng/ml), also increased particulate phosphodiesterase activity 40-60%. Changes in phosphodiesterase activity produced by epinephrine tended to lag behind changes in cAMP. Insulin, epinephrine, and corticotropin increased Vmax, not Km (0.5 microM), for cAMP. Particulate phosphodiesterase activity, solubilized with detergent, eluted in a single peak from DEAE-Bio-Gel. Insulin and epinephrine increased the activity eluted in this peak. Neither insulin nor lipolytic hormones increased activity in soluble fractions from differentiated cells or particulate or soluble fractions from undifferentiated cells. Incubation of adipocytes for 48 h with 1 microM dexamethasone prevented insulin-induced activation of the particulate phosphodiesterase and did not alter basal activity. After incubation for 72 h with 0.1 microM dexamethasone, insulin and epinephrine activation were abolished. These effects of dexamethasone on hormonal regulation of particulate phosphodiesterase activity could account for some of the so-called permissive effects of glucocorticoids on cAMP-mediated processes as well as the anti-insulin effects of glucocorticoids."

https://openalex.org/W1582833331,"A protease inhibitory activity has been detected in the hemolymph of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. The inhibitor possesses many of the characteristics of vertebrate alpha 2-macroglobulin. The inhibitor, found in the high speed supernatant of Limulus plasma, is sensitive to mild acidification, inhibits a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic endopeptidases, and is sensitive to methylamine treatment. Although the inhibitor completely prevents the trypsin-mediated hydrolysis of protein substrates, the hydrolysis of a low molecular substrate by trypsin is unaffected by the inhibitor, a property characteristic of alpha 2-macroglobulin. The striking similarity of the inhibitor to vertebrate alpha 2-macroglobulin, coupled with the fossil record of Limulus, suggests that such protease inhibitors are ancient molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1602465387,"Changes in the level of translatable mRNA coding for glucokinase under different physiological conditions were determined using a reticulocyte lysate translation system and immunoprecipitation. Poly(A+) RNA isolated from livers of rats fed a high carbohydrate diet displayed a 10-fold increase in glucokinase template activity when compared to starved rats. Livers from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats had only 9% of the glucokinase template activity displayed by controls. Administration of insulin to diabetic rats produced an increase in the level of mRNA coding for glucokinase within 20 min and reached a maximum 13-fold increase 1 h following insulin treatment. Under all experimental conditions examined, changes in the level of glucokinase mRNA were accompanied by similar changes in direction and magnitude of enzyme activity and the relative rate of synthesis of the enzyme in vivo. In addition, the developmental appearance of glucokinase activity at the 16th day following birth was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the amount of glucokinase mRNA. Thus, it appears that dietary, hormonal, and developmental changes in the activity of glucokinase arise as the result of changes in the amount of functional mRNA coding for the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1496529909,"Fetal calf liver microsomes were found to be capable of sialylating 14C-galactosylated ovine submaxillary asialomucin. The main oligosaccharide product chain could be obtained by beta-elimination under reductive conditions and was identified as NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAcol (where GalNAcol represents N-acetylgalactosaminitol) by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and methylation. The branched trisaccharide Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)-GalNAcol and the disaccharide NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6GalNAcol were not formed. Very similar results were obtained when asialofetuin and antifreeze glycoprotein were used as an acceptor. When 3H-sialylated antifreeze glycoprotein ([3H]NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc-protein) was incubated with fetal calf liver microsomes and CMP-[14C]NeuAc, a reduced tetrasaccharide could be isolated. The structure of this product chain appeared to be [3H]NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3([14C]NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GalNAcol, as established by means of HPLC analysis, specific enzymatic degradation with Newcastle disease virus neuraminidase, and periodate oxidation. These data indicate that fetal calf liver contains two sialyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the O-linked bisialotetrasaccharide chain. The first enzyme is a beta-galactoside alpha 2 leads to 3 sialyltransferase which converts Gal beta 1 leads to 3 GalNAc chains to the substrate for the second enzyme, a (NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3)GalNAc-protein alpha 2 leads to 6 sialyltransferase. The latter enzyme does not sialylate GalNAc or Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc units but is capable of transferring sialic acid to C-6 of GalNAc in NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc trisaccharide side chains, thereby dictating a strictly ordered sequence of sialylation of the Gal beta 1 leads to 3 GalNAc units in fetal calf liver."
https://openalex.org/W1527783215,"The present study set out to demonstrate the biosynthesis of a prorenin and its processing in the cell, using the richest known natural source of renin, the mouse submandibular gland. Cell-free translation of total poly(A+) RNA or mRNA selected using a renin cDNA yielded Mr = 45,000 preprorenin which in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomal membranes, was converted to Mr = 43,000 prorenin. The latter was seen during in vitro labeling of tissue with [35S]methionine. Prorenin was synthesized first and converted rapidly to Mr = 38,000 single chain renin. Renin was then hydrolyzed slowly to give two chains of Mr = 33,000 and 5,000 held together by disulfide bonds. The Mr = 38,000 and 33,000 species had similar peptide maps. Western blotting of fractions from a pepstatin affinity column identified the separation of prorenin from renin. The results suggested that both single and two-chain renin have an exposed active site. Testosterone stimulated synthesis of prorenin during in vitro labeling of female tissue. Thus, mouse renin is synthesized as a preprorenin (Mr = 45,000) which is converted to a prorenin (Mr = 43,000) and then to renin (Mr = 38,000) by rapid processing within the cell, after which renin is cut slowly to give a two-chain form."
https://openalex.org/W1971949547,"Four facts characterize restrictive recognition of antigen. First, in large measure, allele-specific determinants on R are recognized when R is functioning either as a restricting element (RL) or as an allo-target (or even xeno-target) (RF). Second, there is a high frequency of virgin antigen-responsive t cells with alloreactivity, i.e. anti-RF. Third, there is a strict relationship between the class of effector function and the class of RL recognized (restrictive recognition of antigen, XF) but a relaxed relationship between class of effector function and class of RF recognized (alloreactivity). Fourth, the effector T cell functions anti-RL-dependently when XF is the target (restrictive recognition of antigen) and anti-RL-independently when RF is the target (alloreactivity). From these facts are derived the following conclusions. The T cell uses a dual recognitive, single receptor (Model I, Figure 1). A single germ-line vT locus specifying anti-allele-specific recognition of species R encodes both the anti-R and the anti-X combining sites. A “learning” process (occurring in the thymus) is required to establish the restriction specificity (anti-RL) as well as the effector function/class of RL relationship. The repertoire is derived by somatic mutation of all germ-line VT genes specifying anti-RF (Model IA, Table 3 and Figure 9). Given Model IA (Table 3 and Figure 9), we can account further for the existence of an extensive polymorphism of R and minimal polygeneism, for the high frequency of crossreactivity between anti-XF and RF, and for the physiology and genetics of cell-cell communication in immune responsiveness."

A U2 region is identified as a gene on the basis of near identity of sequence with U2 RNA and capacity to direct the synthesis of U2-like RNA in Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Both U1 and U2 sequences are repeated in the mouse genome, the U2 sequences analyzed here in an inverted repeat arrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2091471768,"CV-1 cells treated with human leukocyte interferon before infection with simian virus 40 (SV40) are protected from virus-induced cytopathic effects. Accumulation of viral mRNA is inhibited markedly. If T antigen is present in interferon-treated cells before infection, viral DNA replication is inhibited only slightly. These results show that many SV40 virions reach the nucleus in a form which can be replicated but not transcribed. Accumulation of SV40 mRNA is not inhibited in cells treated with interferon after infection. Thus the block mediated by interferon is specific for the onset of transcription. Infections with SV40 DNA rather than virions are insensitive to treatment with interferon, showing that the inhibition involves an interaction between viral nucleoprotein complexes and cellular factors."
https://openalex.org/W1601557881,"Previous studies have demonstrated an imbalance in placental levels of the human choriogonadotropin (hCG) alpha and beta subunits. Free alpha subunit was present in first trimester placentae, and the imbalance was accentuated as gestation approached parturition. Two sets of experiments were performed to assess the control on production levels of each subunit. Synthesis of the alpha and beta subunits was assessed by labeling the nascent chains of polysomes derived from first trimester placenta. The products of these reactions were immunoprecipitated with subunit-specific antisera and the labeled subunits were quantitated; the ratio of alpha to beta subunit synthesized was 1.7. To examine whether this imbalanced synthesis reflected differences in the amount of subunit mRNAs, or differing mRNA translational efficiencies, the ratio of the steady state levels of these mRNAs was also determined. Total first trimester placental RNA was hydrolyzed with alkali, 5'-end-labeled with 32P, and hybridized in DNA excess to cloned alpha and beta cDNAs. These experiments demonstrated the presence of twice as much hCG-alpha mRNA as hCG-beta mRNA. In term placenta, the amounts of excess alpha subunit are greater than at first trimester; the ratio of alpha to beta mRNAs in term RNA was about 12:1. Thus, the subunit mRNA levels are independently regulated and their imbalance accounts for differences in the quantities of alpha and beta subunits seen in placental tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1982786884,"We examined expression of the c-myc locus in four cell lines established from bursal lymphomas induced by avian leukosis virus. In all four lines the level of myc-related RNA was elevated. In three lines a majority of the myc-containing RNAs lacked viral-LTR-related sequences, in contrast to results obtained with primary tumors. This suggests that LTR sequences are not required for maintenance of high level c-myc expression. One line, RP9, has a complex pattern of myc RNAs containing LTR sequences, and one of these RNAs is packaged into virions. Using hybrid selection of RNAs with myc DNA, followed by in vitro translation, we detected translation of myc-related proteins from RNA of all four cell lines. The sizes of these proteins differ among the cell lines. The major polypeptides detected were 64, 57, and 54 kilodaltons. Events leading to elevation of c-myc transcription may be accompanied by alterations in mRNA initiation or processing that generate different protein products."
https://openalex.org/W2044137205,"The role of transcription in the development of electrical properties of neuronal membranes has been largely unexplored. To study the molecular events which result in the expression of these properties it is useful to describe the timing of the underlying RNA synthetic events. For example, the timing of the transcription involved in denervation-induced action potentials in frog slow muscle fibres1 and brain extract-induced sodium channels in chick muscle cells2 has been investigated. Previous studies of Xenopus laevis spinal neurones have established that the timing of the development of the neuronal action potential ionic dependence in dissociated cell cultures parallels that seen in vivo3–6. This culture system, therefore, allows the determination of transcription-dependent periods necessary for the development of membrane properties known to have in vivo relevance. In the study described here, actinomycin D was used to examine the timing of the RNA synthetic events necessary for (1) neurite outgrowth and (2) development of the ionic dependence of the action potential. I report that inhibition of transcription at an early stage specifically blocks the appearance of the mature sodium-dependent action potential without affecting either neurite outgrowth or the development of delayed rectification."

In contrast, cholera toxin-stimulated (6 nM, 3 hours) cyclic AMP accumulation was not diminished in cycloheximide-treated cells, and cyclic AMP was only minimally diminished in response to a 30-minute challenge with 10 microM (-)-isoproterenol. These experiments suggest the presence of a previously unrecognized cyclase component, which is essential for forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation and has a shorter half-life than the beta-adrenergic receptor, the guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins, or the cyclase catalytic component."
https://openalex.org/W2019116549,"pCtBR2-2 is a genomic clone from Chironomus tentans that hybridized in situ to Balbiani ring 2 (BR2) on salivary gland polytene chromosome IV. DNA sequencing indicated that the insert contained nearly four copies of a 180 bp tandemly repeated nucleotide sequence that was distinctly different from a previously reported BR2 repeat. Sequence titration experiments detected about 70 copies of the 180 bp repeat per haploid genome, which would correspond to approximately 34% of a 37 kb BR2 gene. Each 180 bp repeat included a conserved 90 bp segment whose sequence was internally nonrepeating (INR), and a variable 90 bp repeated (R) segment comprised of three 30 bp repeats that may have evolved from a 9 bp consensus sequence. Results presented here raise the distinct possibility that other BR genes may contain significantly different repeated sequences that have not been identified."

Clones containing cDNAs to the mRNAs coding for each of the three subunits of a major secretory protein (prostatein) were identified by hybrid-arrested translation. A 457-nucleotide base pair cDNA (E45) and a portion of a 365-base pair cDNA (E85) were analyzed to determine the composite complete DNA coding sequence for the Mr = 14,000 (C3) subunit of prostatein. A sequence of 12-nucleotide bases (TTTGCTGCTATG) in the signal peptide of C3 was noted to be homologous to signal peptide nucleotide sequences reported in cDNAs coding for the other two prostatein subunits, Mr = 6,000 (C1) and 10,000 (C2). Complementary DNA coding for the C3 subunit was used as a hybridization probe to screen an EcoRI rat genomic DNA library. Two unique 12-kilobase genomic clones, each containing mRNA coding sequences within 2.5-3-kilobase fragments, were identified by restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blot analysis. Restriction enzyme sites within the coding regions of both genes were analogous to the cDNA. Differences in restriction enzyme sites in regions of intervening sequences and flanking DNA established the uniqueness of the two genes. It is suggested that both genes may be transcribed in vivo."

This complex migrates anodally, since the hemoglobin is only weakly positively charged at pH 6.2 whereas the carbohydrate carries a net negative charge. Electroendosmosis, on the other hand, proceeds in the cathodal direction. These opposing fluxes separate the hemoglobins in the order of their affinity for agaropectin. An agaropectin binding site was identified on hemoglobin by computer-assisted modeling, and the relation of the site to hemoglobin variants that exhibit abnormal citrate agar mobility was established. The citrate anion is postulated to function as a ""counter ion."" Preliminary evidence indicates that agaropectin has antigelling properties with respect to hemoglobin S."
https://openalex.org/W1504441271,"Abstract Antisera raised in mice to chromatins from different tissues of the chicken reacted preferentially with the chromatin type that was used for immunization. This tissue specificity was also evident in the spectrum of monoclonal antibodies generated when mice were immunized with erythrocyte chromatin. Three erythroid-specific antigens and one antigen that was present in a number of chicken tissues were characterized in further detail. These antigens, which comprised less than 0.1% of the erythrocyte chromatin proteins, were nuclear localized although three were also detected in the cytoplasm. Two of the erythroid-specific antigens existed as multiple polypeptides in isolated chromatin. The multiple chromatin forms of one antigen were derived from a precursor protein that was selectively cleaved within 1 min after erythrocyte lysis. Analysis of this antigen in extracts from erythrocytes and reticulocytes indicated that the cleavage of the precursor protein was developmentally regulated in vivo."

An epitope of the surface antigen was localized by transposon Tn5 mutagenesis mapping of the complementary DNA clone. The Tn5 mutation having the farthest 5′ insert into the complementary DNA portion of the chimeric gene, giving the shortest truncated protein that maintained the ability to bind monoclonal antibody, defined the location of the epitope."
