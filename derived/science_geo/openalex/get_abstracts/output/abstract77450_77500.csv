https://openalex.org/W1518259698,"Abstract Transphosphatidylase activity was recognized in several plant tissues as well as in extracts. It was attributed to phospholipase D. This enzyme was purified 110-fold from Savoy cabbage. The ratio of its hydrolase to its transphosphatidylase activity remained constant throughout the purification. Additional evidence supports the conclusion that both reactions are catalyzed by the same enzyme. Phosphatidylations of ethanol, ethanolamine, and glycerol were readily achieved by incubating phosphatidylcholine and the enzyme in the presence of one of these acceptors. Concentrations of the acceptors required for equality between rates of hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation were 0.7, 0.3, and 1.1%, respectively, for ethanol, ethanolamine, and glycerol. The glycerol configuration in the phosphatidylglycerol thus produced was dl-; phosphatidylation in this case was not stereospecific. Phospholipase D catalyzed exchange between choline and phosphatidylcholine. Its activity was completely inhibited in 10-4 m p-chloromercuribenzoate. The results implicate formation of a phosphothioester linkage in the phosphatidylenzyme complex. The transphosphatidylase function of phospholipase D offers a useful route for synthesis of a variety of phosphatidyl esters."

The B protein was identified as α-lactalbumin, based on the following criteria: substitution in the enzymic rate assays, spectra, immunological titrations, amino acid composition, mobility on starch gel electrophoresis, molecular weight, and cochromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and Sephadex G-100. Thus the biological function of α-lactalbumin is as a natural occurring subunit of lactose synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W2166583557,"General procedures for preparation of lactic dehydrogenases of only the H4 and M4 types are presented. These purified enzymes have only one enzyme band on starch gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of these enzymes are 140,000 to 150,000 g and the sedimentation constants of all the enzymes are in the same range, s020,w = 7.2 to 7.7. It has been concluded that the molecular weights are very similar for all of the enzymes. Amino acid analyses of the enzymes indicate that the H4 and M4 proteins from the same organism are significantly different from each other. Furthermore, there is a close relationship between the amino acid content of either the H4 or M4 enzymes from closely related species. Catalytic properties of the enzymes indicate larger differences among various M4 enzymes than noted previously, although the M4 enzymes were consistently distinct from the H4 enzymes in turnover numbers and Michaelis constants. Optical rotatory dispersion data indicate that the enzymes have similar, but not identical, helical content. Peptide mapping gives patterns consistent with the tetrameric polypeptide structure proposed by several authors."
https://openalex.org/W1568809126,"Abstract Concanavalin A, a globulin found in the jack bean, reacts specifically to form a precipitate with a restricted group of branched polysaccharides. The various parameters optimal for this interaction were investigated by the quantitative precipitin method with a dextran as the precipitating polysaccharide. In this manner, an assay for concanavalin A activity was established. The analogy of this interaction with the antibody-antigen system is striking. A summary of findings follows. 1. Complete precipitation is achieved in 24 hours at 25°. 2. The pH range optimum for the reaction lies between 6.1 and 7.2. 3. The concentration of sodium chloride has no effect on the reaction when the system is buffered at pH 7.0 with phosphate. KI and KCNS, however, are inhibitory. 4. The presence of foreign proteins does not affect the total amount of concanavalin A precipitated. 5. The precipitate formed between concanavalin A and dextran is slightly soluble (1.5 µg of nitrogen per ml) at 25°. 6. More nitrogen is precipitated at 25° than at 0°, the relative amount depending upon the region of the equivalence curve examined."
https://openalex.org/W1594836200,"Abstract A 24-residue peptide, called the fragment, has been isolated from a peptic digest of bovine serum albumin. This peptide has the same terminal sequence, Asp-Thr-, as does bovine serum albumin, and will similarly bind a single ion of copper(II) at its terminal α-amino group. Spectral and titrimetric data are reported which suggest that the Cu(II)-binding site for both albumin and peptide is a chelate locus involving multiple nitrogenous ligands in the neutral pH range. Addition of copper(II) to the peptide decreases the slope of its titration curve in the pH range, 6 to 7, and decreases its catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. These effects lead to the proposal that a histidyl residue occupies position 3 in the peptide chain and that the unique binding site for Cu(II) in both the Asp fragment and intact albumin is the amino-terminal sequence, Asp-Thr-His-. The bulk of the albumin molecule has relatively little influence on the properties of this site."
https://openalex.org/W1605814807,"Lipoproteins of rat plasma have been characterized by lipid analysis, preparative ultracentrifugation, electrophoresis on paper, and immunoelectrophoresis with specific antisera to α-lipoprotein, β-lipoprotein, and whole rat plasma. Similar techniques were used to characterize the lipoproteins released by livers perfused in situ with a suspension of erythrocytes in a medium initially free of rat plasma proteins. Normal rat livers released α-lipoprotein, β-lipoprotein, albumin, and other plasma proteins during the perfusion. When rats were fed orotic acid as 1% of their diet, the plasma β-lipoprotein concentration fell within 7 days to less than 1% of normal. It rebounded to normal within 48 hours following withdrawal of orotic acid or supplementation of the diet with 0.17% of adenine. When perfused in situ, livers from orotic acid-fed rats released α-lipoprotein, albumin, and other plasma proteins but no detectable β-lipoprotein. They released smaller amounts of cholesterol and phospholipid than normal livers and no triglyceride, although they contained 10 times normal amounts of triglycerides. The fatty liver produced in rats by orotic acid appears to result from an inhibition of synthesis or release of hepatic β-lipoprotein, supporting the concept that β-lipoprotein has a specific role in the normal transport of triglyceride out of the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2407778544,"Abstract The isolation of 55 S particles from mitochondria has been reported. Evidence has been presented which emphasizes the importance of adequate control of contamination during preparation of mitochondria. A satisfactory mitochondrial purification method was attained through the use of radioactive microsomal fractions and electron microscopy to assess the contamination of mitochondria and ribosomes isolated from mitochondria prepared by (a) extensive washing by differential centrifugation in various media, (b) purification in continuous sucrose density gradients, and (c) sedimentation through discontinuous density gradients."
https://openalex.org/W1665642577,"Abstract Inhibition by arabinonucleotides of the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides with a partially purified enzyme system from rat tumor was studied. The di- and triphosphates of arabinosyladenine inhibited reduction of all four common ribonucleoside diphosphates to about the same extent; the inhibition appeared to be similar to that given by deoxyadenosine triphosphate at a lower concentration. Nucleotides of arabinosylcytosine inhibited only weakly, to about the same degree as did deoxycytidine triphosphate. It is concluded that inhibition of ribonucleotide reduction probably does not play an important part in the inhibition of DNA synthesis by arabinosylcytosine."
https://openalex.org/W1632131612,"Abstract Cocoonase is a proteolytic enzyme produced by silk moths during adult development and used for softening the end of the cocoon to permit exit of the adult moth. It is deposited on the surface of the galeae (mouth parts) as a partially crystalline deposit. In nature, it is dissolved in a buffer produced by labial glands; for study, it can be picked off the animal in the dry form with forceps. Cocoonase crystals contain an active enzyme (80%) and an inactive protein or peptide or mixture of proteins or peptides (20%). The inactive material is probably derived, at least in part, from the enzyme itself. The active component seems to be a single enzyme as judged by several criteria. It has a molecular weight near 25,000 and an amino acid composition very similar to that of trypsin, except for fewer half-cystine residues. There appears to be only one disulfide bridge. The stability of cocoonase under a variety of conditions is rather different from trypsin, an enzyme which it resembles in other respects. Cocoonase is quite stable to autodigestion at neutral and mildly alkaline pH, but is rapidly deactivated at low pH. It is much less stable than trypsin to heating and to treatment with urea."
https://openalex.org/W1552571410,"Abstract The present studies show that human platelets can incorporate uniformly labeled 14C-l-leucine into trichloracetic acid-precipitable material. This material is digested by Pronase but not by deoxyribonuclease or ribonuclease. Acid hydrolysis of the material liberates a compound with chromatographic properties identical with those of authentic l-leucine. The incorporation of uniformly labeled 14C-l-leucine by platelets is inhibited by puromycin but not by actinomycin D. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first definite demonstration that mammalian platelets can synthesize protein."
https://openalex.org/W1560547243,"A method for the isolation of ribosomes from rat liver mitochondria is reported. These ribosomes have a sedimentation coefficient of 55 S and an average diameter of 145 A in negatively stained preparations. Under the same conditions, 78 S rat liver microsomal ribosomes have an average diameter of about 190 A. The possibility that the 55 S ribosomes originate from the dissociation of contaminating microsomal ribosomes was discounted by showing that conditions used for mitochondrial purification and in the isolation and analysis of mitochondrial ribosomes were sufficient to maintain microsomal ribosomes as 78 S monomers and 114 S dimers. When intact mitochondria were pulse labeled with 14C-leucine in vitro, the 55 S particles acquired label whereas, under the same conditions, microsomal ribosomes did not. The 55 S particle probably represents the monomeric form of the mitochondrial ribosome because (a) it is isolated as the major ribosomal component, (b) its sedimentation coefficient is consistent with the size of native ribosome-like particles observed in mitochondria in situ, and (c) the 55 S ribosomes attain a specific radioactivity 50 times that of the total mitochondrial protein when mitochondria are pulse labeled with 14C-leucine for 5 min in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1543076044,"Abstract Ribosomes in rat liver are present either free or attached to endoplasmic reticulum and in both states exist largely as polyribosomal aggregates. The present communication presents a quantitative study of the distribution of ribosomes between these two states and examines a number of properties of these two groups of ribosomes. It is shown that the base composition and the rate of synthesis of the ribosomal ribonucleic acid of free and membrane-bound ribosomes are the same, and these tindings, along with the results of previous studies of other properties, are consistent with the possibility that there are no intrinsic differences between the ribosomes found in these two states. Since certain conditions are known to produce alterations in the distribution of free and membrane-bound ribosomes which are rapid with respect to the turnover time of ribosomal RNA, it is further suggested that a given ribosome can exist in either state according to the needs of the cell. Although the administration of hydrocortisone in vivo induces acute rises in the levels of certain specific liver enzymes within a few hours, it has no marked effect upon the ratio of free to membrane-bound ribosomes during this period. The ribosomal aggregates obtained by the methods used here are shown to be sufficiently pure to permit the use of ultraviolet absorption as a direct measure of their concentration without applying a correction for ferritin absorption. Homogenization and zone centrifugation do not produce significant artifacts in the determination of the proportions of free and membrane-bound ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1526378809,"A procedure for the isolation of α-gliadin by ultracentrifugation and gel filtration is based on the specific, reversible aggregation of α-gliadin which forms soluble, high particle weight aggregates. Good yields of α-gliadin are obtained which are pure according to the criteria of starch gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. The particle weight of α-gliadin has been estimated to be approximately 50,000 by gel filtration and light scattering."
https://openalex.org/W1502311812,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of a type L Bence-Jones protein (an immunoglobulin λ light chain) has been determined, including the location of the disulfide bridges. λ light chains, like k light chains, are subject to extensive variation in primary structure in the NH2-terminal half, but the COOH-terminal portion appears to be invariant. When aligned to achieve maximum homology, about 40% of the amino acid residues are identical in the sequence of human k and λ chains. Genetic conservation of the main polypeptide chain conformation is reflected in the similar location of the disulfide bridges of k and λ chains and in the similarity in sequence around the half-cystine residues and throughout the entire molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1566971930,"1. The effect of temperature on the conformation of the protease from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus was examined. 2. The thermostable enzyme is stable at room temperature against such denaturing reagents as urea, alcohol, and detergent. 3. However, these reagents accelerate the denaturation of the enzyme by heat. 4. The effect of pH on the stability of the enzyme was examined, and it is suggested that the abnormally ionizing tyrosine residues contribute to the maintenance of the enzyme structure. 5. It is deduced from the physicochemical properties of the heated enzyme that the abnormal ionization and the Cotton effect of the tyrosine residues are due primarily to the hydrogen bonding of the phenol group."
https://openalex.org/W1534145818,"Abstract Tryptic peptides were isolated from the β chains of sheep hemoglobins A, B, and C and placed in linear array through the use of nonuniform radioactive label. Nearly complete sequence analysis indicates that the β chains of hemoglobins A and B contain 145 amino acids while the β chain of hemoglobin C lacks 4 residues in its NH2-terminal portion and contains only 141 amino acids. The sum of differences between the sequences of A and B β chains involves a minimum of 7 residues, the sum between A and C, a minimum of 16 residues, and the sum between B and C a minimum of 21 residues. The β chains of A and C share a common difference with respect to the β chain of B at five sites. It is likely that one or more of these five differences account for the increased oxygen affinity which hemoglobins A and C share when compared with hemoglobin B."
https://openalex.org/W1597549047,"Cocoonase, a proteolytic enzyme produced by silk moths, is active toward a variety of proteins. It also hydrolyzes specifically esters of basic amino acids, thus showing specificity characteristic of trypsin. Kinetic constants for the hydrolysis of synthetic substrates are remarkably similar to those of trypsin and thrombin. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate is a potent inhibitor of cocoonase, suggesting the presence of a serine in the active site. Heavy metal ions and sulfhydryl reagents have little inhibitory effect. 1-Chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone is inhibitory, indicating that histidine may participate in the active site. Soybean trypsin inhibitor blocks the action of cocoonase to a degree intermediate between its actions on trypsin and chymotrypsin. A comparison is made among cocoonase, other insect proteases, and the better known mammalian proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1513471672,"Abstract The role of Mg2+ in the pyruvate carboxylase reaction has been investigated with kinetic methods. The results suggest that Mg2+ has at least two roles in the reaction mechanism; (a) it forms a complex with ATP4- to form the true MgATP2- substrate, and (b) it forms a complex with the enzyme to activate the enxymic reaction. The MgATP2- complex deviates from Michaelis-Menten kinetics in such a way as to indicate a homotropic cooperative effect involving at least 2 molecules of ligand. Excess Mg2+ induced a 3-fold stimulation of enzymic activity at saturating levels of MgATP2-. Excess Mg2+ causes changes in (a) the apparent Km value; (b) the slope of the Hill plot, and (c) the apparent Vmac when MgATP2- is the variable substrate. The apparent Km value for MgATP2- is found to be 6.6 x 10-4 m in the absence of free Mg2+ and 3.2 x 10-4 m in the presence of 1 x 10-3 m MgCl2. The apparent Km value for free Mg2+ is 2.5 x 10-4 m in the presence of 5.6 x 10-4 m MgATP2-. It is concluded that Mg2+ exhibits a heterotropic cooperative effect with respect to MgATP2-. Two possible mechanisms for the binding of Mg2+ and MgATP2- are suggested. Mg2+ may bind either at a specific effector site or, alternatively, at one of the binding sites for MgATP2- which is capable of functioning as an effector site. ATP4- was found to be a partial competitive inhibitor of MgATP2-."
https://openalex.org/W1562331866,"Abstract The pH-dependent second order rate constant for the reaction of fluorodinitrobenzene with the α-amino group of the α chain of human CO-hemoglobin was determined at 25° and a series of pH values from 6 to 8. The pK of this group was calculated from these data to be 6.72 ± 0.03. The pH-independent second order rate constant (the rate constant for the uncharged amino group) was calculated to be 0.236 ± 0.009 m-1 sec-1. The pK values and the pH-independent second order rate constants of the α-amino groups of the peptides valylleucine and valylleucine amide were determined by the same method. For valylleucine the pK was found to be 7.90 ± 0.03 and the pH-independent second order rate constant was 0.062 ± 0.003 m-1 sec-1. These constants for valylleucine amide were found to be 7.65 ± 0.03 and 0.061 ± 0.002 m-1 sec-1. The pK values of the α-amino groups of the peptides determined by this kinetic method were found to be identical with the values independently determined by a potentiometric method. The sum of the rate constants for the reaction of fluorodinitrobenzene with all of the reactive groups of human CO-hemoglobin was also determined at a series of pH values. These data indicate that, in addition to the α-amino group of the α chain, at least two other groups react with this reagent under the conditions employed. One group or set of groups with a pH-independent rate constant lower than that of the α-amino group of the α chain appears to have a pK below 8, while another group or set of groups with a high pH-independent rate constant appears to have a pK above 9."
https://openalex.org/W1633099149,"Abstract The rabbit reticulocyte shows no saturable uptake of glycine or alanine in the absence of Na+. After maturation of the cell to the erythrocyte state, only a trace of this sensitivity can be detected. Other univalent cations show no ability to replace Na+ in the stimulation. The uptake both of glycine and alanine by the reticulocyte corresponds to the Michaelis-Menten equation in the presence of Na+, the effect of increasing [Na+] being primarily to decrease Km, but also to increase Vmax somewhat. The rate of alanine uptake as a function of [Na+] corresponds also to the Michaelis-Menten equation, but, for glycine, correspondence is obtained only if a term in the second power of [Na+] is also included, confirming an observation of Vidaver. The presence of Na+ permits alanine uptake to proceed to steady state distribution ratios above 1, in favor of the cell interior. For alanine, the counter transport phenomenon, in either the inward or outward direction, is dependent on the presence of Na+; for valine, which along with leucine shows a Na+-independent uptake, counter transport is unaffected by the presence of Na+. The presence of ouabain, oligomycin, or puromycin, the latter for extended intervals, does not inhibit the uptake of alanine by the reticulocyte. The origin of the loss of transport systems on maturation of the reticulocyte is discussed in the light of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1537626122,"A guanosine triphosphate-specific acyl coenzyme A synthetase has been purified from extracts of sonically disrupted rat liver mitochondria. This enzyme, which is free of adenosine triphosphate-dependent activating systems and from succinyl-CoA synthetase activity, catalyzes the formation of CoA esters of both long and short chain fatty acids. GTP-specific fatty acid activation is inhibited by orthophosphate and fluoride."
https://openalex.org/W1555652261,"The role of pH, temperature, salt type, and salt concentration on the three possible transformations involving the crystalline, dispersed helical, and randomly coiled forms of collagen has been investigated. The results are given in terms of pseudo phase diagrams where the field of stability of each form is delimited by the curves representing the variation of the three transformation temperatures with salt concentration for a given salt type and pH. The data are adequate to characterize the behavior of the systems corresponding to situations where the solute is an isoelectric protein or a cationic polyelectrolyte. It is shown that a general mechanism for the interaction between salts and proteins based on the previously defined specific (i.e. binding) and diluent effects, is adequate to describe the transformations crystalline form → randomly coiled form, crystalline form → helical form, helical form → randomly coiled form under isoelectric conditions. The polyelectrolyte behavior included the reversal of the orders of effectiveness of anions with respect to the orders observed under isoelectric conditions. This is explained on the basis of an order for binding of the anions to the solute which remains the same irrespective of whether the protein is iso-electric or cationic."
https://openalex.org/W1568560175,"Abstract Long chain fatty acids are oxidized by rat liver mitochondria provided that endogenous adenosine triphosphate is not depleted. If endogenous ATP is depleted, e.g. by 2,4-dinitrophenol, external ATP as well as carnitine is required for fatty acid oxidation. Atractyloside does not block this reaction in media containing orthophosphate buffer. Oligomycin can substitute for carnitine, but the oligomycin-dependent route is inhibited by atractyloside. These experimental situations localize two ATP-dependent fatty acid-activating systems, one of which is linked to carnitine. The dinitrophenol-insensitive, GTP-specific fatty acyl coenzyme A synthetase is active only in the absence of orthophosphate. Inhibition of oxidation of fatty acids by atractylate in phosphate-free media is not relieved with oligomycin or carnitine."
https://openalex.org/W1488089862,"The arginine-rich histone complex from fetal calf thymus was found to contain 12 or more histone components by electrophoretic analysis on polyacrylamide gels. The arginine-rich histone complex was resolved into five distinct peaks b,y exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-100 columns 300 cm in height and 7.6 cm in diameter, with 0.01 m HCl as the eluent. Of the five peaks obtained, two (Peaks 3 and 5) contained arginine-rich histone fractions. Peak 4 contained slightly lysine-rich histones. In Peaks 1 and 2, the arginine and lysine contents were almost equal. The last peak (Peak 5) contained a glycine-rich, arginine-rich histone in high purity as evidenced by electrophoretic homogeneity and peptide mapping."
https://openalex.org/W1550092053,"A simple method is described whereby millimicromole amounts of extensively purified N5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine transmethylase (vitamin B12 transmethylase) can be chemically propylated to yield an inhibited vitamin B12 enzyme which is reactivated with light. The procedure consists of a short incubation of the enzyme with propyl iodide in the presence of reduced flavin mononucleotide and dithiothreitol under hydrogen gas. Formation of a propylated (inhibited) enzyme was correlated with alterations in the visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme. When propyl-1-14C bromide was the alkylating agent a radioactive enzyme was formed which lost radioactivity upon exposure to light. The effects of several reaction parameters on the extent of propylation were examined as was the effect of propylation on four separate transmethylation reactions catalyzed by the vitamin B12 enzyme preparations. Transmethylation reactions which require catalytic amounts of S-adenosylmethionine (AMe) as a cofactor or in which AMe itself is the substrate methyl donor were inhibited by propylation; however, methyl group transfer from methyl-B12 (5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide methyl) to homocysteine was not affected by propylation. Micromolar concentrations of both AMe and N5-methyltetrahydrofolate markedly inhibited propylation as did higher levels of methyl iodide. For the inhibition of propylation by low concentrations of N5-methyltetrahydrofolate a noninhibitory amount of AMe was essential."
https://openalex.org/W1588424578,"A nucleoside diphosphokinase which also catalyzes an adenosine triphosphate-adenosine diphosphate exchange reaction has been extracted from bovine liver mitochondria and purified by conventional methods of protein fractionation. A comparison of the catalytic properties of the two activities indicates that both are catalyzed by the same enzyme, which is different in several respects from the nucleoside diphosphokinase previously isolated by others from rat liver and from erythrocytes. Evidence is presented that the enzyme herein described also catalyzes the dinitrophenol-sensitive ATP-ADP exchange reaction when bound to intact mitochondria and to phosphorylating submitochondrial particles."
https://openalex.org/W1536261037,"In order to investigate the nucleophilic reactivity of the single sulfhydryl group of streptococcal proteinase, the rates of alkylation of this group by chloroacetic acid and chloroacetamide have been studied. The pH dependence of rate constants for alkylation by these two reagents, one anionic and one neutral, were compared with each other and with the pH dependence of rate constants for alkylation of the sulfhydryl of reduced glutathione by the same reagents. The pK of the sulfhydryl group of the enzyme is almost certainly higher than 8.0. The protein sulfhydryl group is 50 to 100 times as reactive as the sulfhydryl in glutathione. The curve of k2 with respect to pH is sigmoid when the protein is alkylated by chloroacetamide and bell-shaped when chloroacetic acid is the alkylating agent. Both reactions lead solely to the formation of the corresponding S-substituted cysteine derivative. The rate curves with respect to pH for the alkylation of reduced glutathione by the two reagents do not show such disparities. The data suggest that the immediate environment of the unusually reactive sulfhydryl group of the enzyme changes from a positive one at pH 4 to a negative one at pH 10. These results show that the ionic environment of the sulfhydryl group in the protein is very complex."
https://openalex.org/W1588389195,"Abstract Phosphoserine aminotransferase has been purified about 500-fold from sheep brain extracts by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sephadex and diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography. On ultracentrifugation, the enzyme migrated in a single peak with a sedimentation constant of 4.2 S. The molecular weight determined by the Trautman modification of the Archibald method is 96,000. The spectrum of the aminotransferase shows an absorption peak at 415 mµ. The enzyme could be inactivated by dialysis against cysteine, and the activity was restored upon incubation with pyridoxal phosphate. This and other evidence suggest that the latter is a coenzyme for this enzyme. The enzyme utilizes glutamic acid preferentially for transamination. The reaction rate with alanine as amino group donor is about 10% of that of glutamate. The optimum activity is at pH 8.15. In characterizing the enzyme, the transamination reaction was followed in both directions and the stoichiometry, the equilibrium constant, and the Michaelis constants for 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (0.25 mm) and glutamate (0.7 mm) have been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1607297970,"Abstract The effect of temperature on the binding of l-thyroxine to human serum albumin and to albumin defatted by the method of Goodman has been studied by equilibrium dialysis. The albumin was first freed of other contaminating thyroxine-binding proteins by zone electrophoresis on a preparative Porath cellulose column. Albumin, both native and defatted, shows only a small temperature dependence of binding. At 30° and 37° (pH 7.4), the constants that best fit the binding data for native albumin are n1 = 0.85 ± 0.15, k'1 = 1.41 x 106 m-1 ± 0.2, n2 = 5 or 6, k'2 = 0.095 x 106 m-1 or 0.067 x 106 m-1. At 6° the constants for native albumin are n1 = 1, k'1 = 1.6 x 106 m-1, n2 = 6, k'2 = 0.05 x 106 m-1. For defatted albumin the primary binding constants at 30° are n1 = 1, k'1 = 1.4 x106m-1. At 6° the primary binding constants for defatted albumin are n1 = 1, k'1 = 1.6 x 106 m-1. The thermodynamic parameters for association at the primary binding site are (a) for native albumin, ΔF° = -8.40 kcal per mole (30°, n1 = 1), ΔH° = -2.02 kcal per mole, ΔS° = +21 e.u.; (b) for defatted albumin, ΔF° = -8.51 kcal per mole (30°), ΔH° = -0.94 kcal per mole, ΔS° = +25 e.u. Chloride ions inhibit thyroxine binding to albumin. At 30° and pH 7.4, thyroxine binding to albumin is reduced by 50% in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl."
https://openalex.org/W2120581661,"Abstract Inorganic pyrophosphatase was purified 1800-fold from human erythrocytes by a procedure involving complete hemolysis of the cells, removal of hemoglobin, ammonium sulfate fractionation, diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography, and gel filtration. Magnesium chloride and 2-mercaptoethanol stabilized the activity. The procedure yielded an enzyme with an optimal pH of 7.7, and an apparent Michaelis constant of 9.7 x 10-6 m. Magnesium was essential for activity with an optimal Mg2+ PPi ratio of 1. These data suggest that the natural substrate for the erythrocyte pyrophosphatase is MgPP2-i. The enzyme showed very strict specificity for inogranic pyrophosphate. Adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, inosine triphosphate, and inorganic tripolyphosphate were not acted upon in the presence of Mg2+ or Zn2+ as activator. Moreover, unlike the mitochondrial and the microsomal pyrophosphatases, the erythrocyte enzyme showed no PPi-glucose transphosphorylase activity. The Arrhenius plot of the erythrocyte pyrophosphatase exhibited a transition at 29° with an activation energy of 8,560 cal per mole above this temperature and 12,900 cal per mole below it. The activity was inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, but was much less sensitive to alloxan, N-ethylmaleimide, and iodoacetamide. In the erythrocyte, inorganic pyrophosphatase probably plays a role in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide formation by hydrolyzing the PPi produced in its three synthetic steps."
https://openalex.org/W1668079603,"Abstract Equilibration of maleate in D2O with a partially purified preparation of maleate hydratase from rabbit kidney resulted in the formation of d-malate containing 1 atom of stably bound deuterium per molecule. The enzyme therefore catalyzes a stereospecific addition to the double bond of maleate. The product of the enzymatic hydration in D2O was examined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, the monodeuteriosuccinate obtained by chemical reduction of the deuterated d-malate was analyzed for its optical rotatory properties. The absolute configuration of the enzymatically deuterated malate was thus established and corresponded to the structure d-malate-3-d-(3-R). It was concluded that the over-all reaction catalyzed by maleate hydratase is trans."
https://openalex.org/W1515178033,"Abstract Construction of a digital computer model based on measured kinetic constants of the pyruvate kinase reaction is described. A model omitting divalent cation activator is shown to behave in agreement with observation, and is then used to clarify the quantitative role of this enzyme in the control of glycolysis. The reaction velocity may increase by a factor of 2 to 4 on going from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. Part of this finding is then verified experimentally. Various inhibitors are included in the model, and new experimental data on inhibition by AMP are presented. The model is then amplified by including the controlling divalent cation activator, magnesium, the physiological concentration of which is low enough to exert strong control on the reaction velocity. This indicates that the powerful adenosine triphosphate inhibition is due both to its chelation of magnesium and to its occupying the enzyme binding site meant for adenosine diphosphate as well as the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphate site. Additional experiments are suggested. The kinetic feasibility of the mechanism proposed by Mildvan and Cohn (16) is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1580578727,"Abstract Hydrogen ion titration curves have been determined for two stoichiometric albumin-detergent complexes, AD11 and AD76, which are formed through interaction between bovine plasma albumin and the detergent sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate. The amphoteric properties of the protein moiety in these two complexes have been compared with one another and with those of the uncombined protein. In this analysis, electrophoretic mobility data were used for making the necessary corrections for electrostatic interaction. Tyrosyl ionization curves were established for all three forms by measuring the change with pH of absorption at 295 mµ. The most significant differences found are in the tyrosyl ionization. For albumin itself, the apparent value of pKint is approximately 11.0, and it is concluded that some masked tyrosyl residues are exposed in a cooperative structural change accompanying the ionization. In the case of AD11, tyrosyl ionization is distinctly hypersharp and the apparent pKint is 11.3, implying that in this form the protein is stabilized against unmasking of the tyrosyl residues. In AD76 the apparent pKint is again near 11.0. The titration behavior of imidazole groups is virtually identical in the native protein and in the AD11 complex. In both cases it is necessary to assume two classes of imidazole groups in order to fit the titration curve. In AD76 the titration of these groups can be fitted adequately with a single pKint of 7.30. Surprisingly, very little difference is seen between the various forms in the titration of the e-amino groups. This fact permits the conclusion that electrostatic interaction between the detergent anions and cationic ammonium groups cannot contribute more than 700 cal to the free energy of binding, whereas the total binding free energy (on the unitary scale) must be of the order of 10,000 cal. The fact that the stoichiometry of the complexes is virtually unaltered over the pH range 6.9 to 11.6, over which range the total number of cationic sites in the protein falls from approximately 100 to 40, supports the conclusion that binding is not primarily electrostatic but is probably due to hydrophobic interactions. To a first approximation, all results suggest that the protein in AD11 is essentially in the native state and in fact is stabilized with respect to the structural alteration which must occur on conversion to AD76."
https://openalex.org/W1546686076,"Abstract Rats were given radioactive l-leucine by intravenous injection. At times ranging from 30 sec to 4 hours after injection, livers were frozen in situ, lyophilized, and separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions in nonaqueous solvents. In each of the fractions thus prepared, the following were determined: (a) concentration of free labeled amino acid, (b) specific activity of the total protein, and (c) specific radioactivity of the lactic dehydrogenase. The injected amino acid entered both the cytoplasm and nucleus very rapidly, reaching a maximum concentration at about 1 min after injection. The level then diminished. Throughout the experimental period, the concentration of free labeled leucine was the same in the nucleus as in the cytoplasm. The curves obtained by plotting specific activity of total protein against time after injection of the labeled amino acid were similar for the cytoplasm and nucleus. After an initial lag of less than 1 min, both curves rose rapidly for 20 min, then leveled off. The similarity between the two curves is interpreted to indicate that protein synthesis occurs in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm, and that the rate of protein synthesis is roughly comparable at these two sites. Such an interpretation depends upon the assumption that movement of proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus is, in general, a slow process, an assumption for which there is considerable evidence in the literature. The curves obtained by plotting specific radioactivity of lactic dehydrogenase against time after injection of the labeled amino acid were again very similar for the cytoplasm and nucleus. As for total protein, both curves rose rapidly for about 20 min, following an initial short lag, then leveled off. The similarity between these two curves suggests that lactic dehydrogenase is synthesized in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm, and that the rate of synthesis is about the same at the two loci. This interpretation depends upon the assumption that movement of the enzyme between the cytoplasm and nucleus occurs slowly."
https://openalex.org/W1482552943,Abstract A new enzyme has been purified from a homogenate of the albumen-secreting region of hen oviduct. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3' -phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to position 6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine moiety of uridine diphosphate N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate.
https://openalex.org/W1506661757,"Abstract Some aspects of the immediate and long term metabolic fate of injected 75Se-selenomethionine were studied in the rat. In addition to the radioselenomethionine, two radioseleno compounds were detected in the precursor amino acid pool of the liver as well as in the hydrolysates of liver proteins and serum albumin. The two compounds had the chromatographic mobility of l-cysteine and l-cystine in two solvent systems. Specific of a sulfur amino acid was defined as the 75Se radioactivity associated with a measured quantity of the chromatographically separated amino acid. The changing specific activity of l-methionine and l-cysteine + l-cystine in the precursor pool, liver protein hydrolysate, and serum albumin resembles a precursor-product relationship. The serum albumin synthesis rates calculated from these curves are consistent with the known turnover rates of serum albumin in the rat. The data suggest the formation in tissues of the radioseleno analogues of l-cysteine and l-cystine. Evidence is presented which indicates the efficient reutilization of one or more of the selenoamino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2119844929,"Abstract The energy-linked accumulation of Mg++ by isolated heart mitochondria has been studied with the use of exogenous adenosine triphosphate as the source of energy. In common with the substrate-supported accumulation of Mg++, the ATP-supported reaction is activated by the addition of Zn++, Cd++, and certain other heavy metal cations under the appropriate conditions. In sharp contrast with the substrate reaction, however, it was found that the ATP-supported reaction is also strongly activated by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (CMS). The combination of Zn++ and CMS strongly inhibits the substrate-dependent accumulation of Mg++, but produces a remarkable enhancement of Mg++ uptake in the presence of ATP. The increased accumulation of Mg++ and the increased ATPase activity which accompanied the accumulation are both inhibited by oligomycin. The accumulation of Mg++ by this pathway is much less sensitive to low levels of dinitrophenol than is the substrate-dependent reaction. When both substrate and ATP are available as energy sources for Mg++ accumulation, and the reaction is activated by Zn++, the uptake of Mg++ is sensitive to dinitrophenol and insensitive to oligomycin. Addition of CMS under these conditions reverses this pattern of inhibition so that the accumulation becomes sensitive to oligomycin but insensitive to dinitrophenol. The available evidence indicates that Zn++ may act directly on the process responsible for the uptake of Mg++, perhaps by altering the permeability of the membrane. The mercurial (CMS), however, appears to have its primary effect on the energy transfer process. Evidence is presented that this reagent blocks energy transfer between the dinitrophenol-sensitive site and the site which energizes the Mg++ uptake process. In addition, CMS may activate mitochondrial ATPase in such a way that more energy is available for the accumulation of Mg++."
https://openalex.org/W1588902860,"Abstract In order to determine why protein synthesis declines with reticulocyte maturation, rabbit reticulocytes separated by age on a density gradient of bovine serum albumin were studied. The ribosomal fraction was identified as the cell fraction largely responsible for this decline. Magnesium ion concentration in the soluble fraction of the cell declines with maturation. This decline may have functional significance, since the cell-free system from old cells showed a greater dependence on added magnesium than did the cell-free system from young cells. In response to added polyuridylic acid, the cell-free system from old cells synthesized polyphenylalanine at a slower rate than did the cell-free system from young cells, even when tested with equal concentrations of ribosomes. This difference was attributed to decreased responsiveness of the ribosomes from old cells to polyuridylic acid. A similar difference in responsiveness to endogenous messenger for hemoglobin would fully account for the observed difference in hemoglobin synthesis. A reticulocyte ribonuclease activity, extracted from the intact cells with a hypertonic solution containing ethylenediaminetetraacetate and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, declines with maturation from the earliest stage studied onward. The difference in activity of young and old cells was not due to a difference in membrane permeability, a deficiency in amino acids or adenosine triphosphate, nor to a diffusable activator or inhibitor of protein synthesis. No difference was found in the effects of heme, protoporphyrin IX, iron, or high and low oxygen tensions in either whole cells or cell fractions, nor in the ribosomal ribonucleic acid to protein ratio."
https://openalex.org/W1574218936,"Abstract Circular dichroism spectra between 185 and 320 mµ were obtained on phosvitin at pH 3.4 and 6.6. A strong negative band at 198 mµ dominates both spectra. At higher wave lengths, a negative shoulder at 225 mµ is present at pH 3.4, although at pH 6.6, two weak bands, one positive, the other negative, are observed at 220 mµ and 233 mµ, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1629582552,"The kinetics and mechanism of action of a partially purified hexokinase from rat skeletal muscle tissue were investigated. The enzyme was isolated after a series of ammonium sulfate fractionations and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. Initial rate experiments revealed a fundamental difference between this enzyme, which is referred to as muscle hexokinase II, and another hexokinase present in muscle tissue. These observations are consistent with the demonstration by Katzen and Schimke of the existence of two hexokinase isozymes in rat skeletal muscle tissue (3). The mechanism of action of muscle hexokinase II appears to be of the rapid equilibrium random type, i.e. random addition of substrates to the enzyme, where all enzyme and substrate interactions equilibrate rapidly relative to interconversion of the central ternary complexes, enzyme-adenosine triphosphate-glucose and enzyme-adenosine diphosphateglucose 6-phosphate. The other hexokinase present in muscle tissue exhibits a reaction mechanism in which a substrate reacts with the enzyme to produce a product prior to the addition of the second substrate. Kinetic experiments with AMP, ADP, mannose, and mannose-6-P suggest that muscle hexokinase II is similar, but not identical, in its mechanism of action to yeast hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and creatine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1492966791,"Abstract A ribonuclease was purified 4,100 times from corn seed meal. The enzyme was homogeneous on analytical gel filtration and has an estimated molecular weight of 23,000 from the gel filtration data. The RNase from Illinois Low Protein corn gave two bands on disc electrophoresis, while the RNase from two hybrids gave only a single band. The amino acid composition of the RNases from the two sources was essentially the same. The RNase liberates cyclic nucleotides from dinucleotides, and is more active on the purine residues. Only purine cyclic nucleotides are hydrolyzed at an appreciable rate."
https://openalex.org/W1586543430,"Abstract Thyroxine added to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in vitro stimulates amino acid incorporation into the lysate protein. In agreement with previous findings in other cell-free preparations, the thyroxine effect is dependent on the addition of mitochondria and an oxidizable substrate to the reaction system. The products of the thyroxine-stimulated amino acid-incorporation reaction include both the α and β chains of hemoglobin. By analysis of both the amino-terminal and the interior valine positions labeled with l-valine-14C during polypeptide chain formation, it was found that the thyroxine stimulation of β chain synthesis involves both chain initiation and completion, i.e. complete synthesis de novo, although the effect on completion is considerably greater than that on initiation. In the case of α chain synthesis, thyroxine stimulated the completion of chains previously begun in vivo without any apparent effect on the initiation of new chains during the incubation. The data suggest that the primary site of the thyroxine stimulation of protein biosynthesis is at a late stage in polypeptide chain elongation, chain termination, or chain release, and that chain initiation may be secondarily increased when the rates of the earlier reactions are favorable."
https://openalex.org/W1924270178,"Abstract The effect of carboxymethylation of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin on the conversion of the protein to the deoxymyoglobin (ferromyoglobin), oxymyoglobin, and carboxymyoglobin forms was studied. Judged by observations on the absorption spectra and on optical rotation at 233 mµ, the conversions to the other heme states were largely unaffected by carboxymethylation to the extent of an average of 7 out of the 12 histidine residues; this left an average of 5 histidine residues unchanged. If the carboxymethylation reaction was carried farther, however, clear evidence of altered properties was obtained. Some evidence was obtained which implied that formation of the carboxymyoglobin derivative could drive the somewhat altered structure back to a form close to the native structure. The course of carboxymethylation of ferromyoglobin and carboxymyoglobin was also followed. In both cases the reaction followed much the same course as that with ferrimyoglobin. Under comparable conditions slightly more histidine residues proved to be modified in the reaction with carboxymyoglobin than with ferrimyoglobin, an observation reflected in a higher content of 1-carboxymethylhistidine. It is suggested that the difference in content of 1-carboxymethylhistidine may imply a greater reactivity of the E7 histidme residue. With the exception of the possibility raised above of a slightly higher reactivity at the nitrogen 1 of a histidine residue in the carboxymyoglobin form, the results indicate very similar reactivity patterns of exposed histidine residues in ferrimyoglobin and in ferromyoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1576592013,"Abstract We have investigated the ability of calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid, subjected to a mild x-irradiation, to prime for the partially purified deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the same tissue. Solutions of 50 to 400 µg per ml of DNA in 10-2 m phosphate or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer, pH 7.0 to 8.0, were exposed to doses up to 2000 r. This treatment had apparently no effect on the primer saturation curves obtained when increasing quantities of DNA were incubated for a standard period with substrates at optimal concentration and in the presence of a constant amount of enzyme. The results have shown that a moderate x-irradiation of isolated mammalian DNA does not cause molecular damages affecting the duplication rate of single stranded DNA chains by a base-pairing mechanism, while it is catalyzed by the DNA polymerase from calf thymus in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1482379637,"Abstract The requirement of a contraction factor such as catalase in adenosine triphosphate-dependent reversal of glutathione-induced swelling of rat liver mitochondria has been re-examined in view of the tiding of Cash and Gardy (11) that commercial samples of reduced glutathione contain sufficient iron, copper, and calcium to account for their swelling activity. Fe++, Cu++, and Ca++, tested in the absence of GSH, were found to cause swelling of rat liver mitochondria in concentrations in which they may be present as contaminants in commercial GSH preparations. However, ATP + Mg++ + bovine serum albumin readily reversed mitochondrial swelling caused by these metals; additions of crystalline catalase were not required, nor did they influence the rate or extent of the reversal significantly. On the other hand, swelling caused by commercial GSH preparations, or by mixtures of GSH and metal ions, was not reversed by ATP, Mg++, and bovine serum albumin unless crystalline catalase was added. Contaminating Fe++, Cu++, or Ca++ ions may therefore be the actual causative agents for mitochondrial swelling produced by commercial GSH preparations. However, if this is the case, the findings show that the presence of GSH so modifies the course of the swelling that it cannot be reversed by ATP + Mg++ + bovine serum albumin unless catalase (contraction factor II) is also present."
https://openalex.org/W1482112852,"Phenazine methosulfate was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of H+ in light-induced H+ transport as well as a competitive inhibitor of orthophosphate in photophosphorylation. Similarly, H+, NH4+, and Pi in the presence of adenosine diphosphate were shown to inhibit competitively light-induced binding of phenazine methosulfate to chloroplasts. Pi, in the absence of ADP or other anions such as acetate, partially inhibits light-induced binding of phenazine methosulfate to chloroplasts. However, this inhibition requires a high concentration of the anions. These observations strengthen the concept, previously proposed, that the energetic event in phosphorylation is the removal of the hydrogen atom, as a proton, from Pi by a light-induced nonspecific anionic site or sites within chloroplasts."

https://openalex.org/W1536566630,"Abstract We studied the time course of 18O exchange between water and inorganic orthophosphate catalyzed by rat skeletal myofibrils during the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate. A lag period of 3 to 4 min occurred, during which Pi liberated from ATP contained only the amount of 18O expected from the hydrolytic reaction. Following this lag period, an exchange of 18O between water and Pi was noted, the rate of this exchange paralleled the rate of the hydrolysis of ATP. The lag period was eliminated in the presence of 1,2-bis(2-dicarboxy methylaminoethoxy)ethane. An exchange of 18O between water and Pi of the medium was detectable in the absence of ATP and, during ATP hydrolysis, at high concentrations of medium Pi (above 30 mm). The predominant exchange reaction observed is one occurring between water and an intermediate in the hydrolysis of ATP by myofibrils. The lag in 18O exchange may be related to the formation of an activated myosin-phosphate intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1523749944,"Abstract Prolonged incubation (6 hours) of adipose tissue from fed and 48-hour-fasted rats resulted in an increased rate of synthesis of fatty acids and glyceride glycerol from glucose uniformly labeled with 14C. However, lipogenesis from acetate-1-14C was increased by prolonged incubation in tissues from fasted animals only. These changes in the rate of lipid synthesis were not attributable to alterations in the content of free fatty acid in the tissue during incubation. The effect of prolonged incubation was demonstrable only in the absence of insulin or when very low concentrations were added. This was masked in the presence of a high concentration of insulin. Prolonged incubation increased the rate of glucose entry, as indicated by the more rapid accumulation of the nonmetabolizable sugar 3-O-methylglucose. It is concluded that the increase in utilization of glucose for lipid synthesis following prolonged incubation can be accounted for by the increased rate of glucose entry into the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1571016839,"Abstract The solubilization of glucose and several related sugars in benzene solutions of rigorously purified phosphatidylcholine has been studied; the equilibrium degree of solubilization has been found to depend on the size of the sugar molecule relative to that of the lecithin micelle, and on the number and the acidity of its free hydroxyl groups. The uptake of glucose increased as the lecithin concentration decreased, achieving a 1:1 molar ratio at a concentration below the critical micelle concentration at which small micelles of lecithin aggregate into larger ones. Osmometric evidence indicated that, at higher concentrations, the glucose was carried within the lecithin micelle. Enthalpy and entropy of solubilization have been evaluated, and are consistent with a mechanism involving hydrogen bonding via the glucose hydroxyl groups. Cholesterol, when present as cosolute, competed for hydrogen bonding sites on the lecithin and thus lowered the degree of solubilization, but in benzene solutions lecithin exhibited a 5:1 preference for glucose hydroxyl over cholesterol hydroxyl."
