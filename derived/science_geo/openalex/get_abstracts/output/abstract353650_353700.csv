https://openalex.org/W2159545748,"Mammalian lungs are branched networks containing thousands to millions of airways arrayed in intricate patterns that are crucial for respiration. How such trees are generated during development, and how the developmental patterning information is encoded, have long fascinated biologists and mathematicians. However, models have been limited by a lack of information on the normal sequence and pattern of branching events. Here we present the complete three-dimensional branching pattern and lineage of the mouse bronchial tree, reconstructed from an analysis of hundreds of developmental intermediates. The branching process is remarkably stereotyped and elegant: the tree is generated by three geometrically simple local modes of branching used in three different orders throughout the lung. We propose that each mode of branching is controlled by a genetically encoded subroutine, a series of local patterning and morphogenesis operations, which are themselves controlled by a more global master routine. We show that this hierarchical and modular programme is genetically tractable, and it is ideally suited to encoding and evolving the complex networks of the lung and other branched organs."
https://openalex.org/W2033518550,"Drosophila endogenous small RNAs are categorized according to their mechanisms of biogenesis and the Argonaute protein to which they bind. MicroRNAs are a class of ubiquitously expressed RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length, which arise from structured precursors through the action of Drosha-Pasha and Dicer-1-Loquacious complexes. These join Argonaute-1 to regulate gene expression. A second endogenous small RNA class, the Piwi-interacting RNAs, bind Piwi proteins and suppress transposons. Piwi-interacting RNAs are restricted to the gonad, and at least a subset of these arises by Piwi-catalysed cleavage of single-stranded RNAs. Here we show that Drosophila generates a third small RNA class, endogenous small interfering RNAs, in both gonadal and somatic tissues. Production of these RNAs requires Dicer-2, but a subset depends preferentially on Loquacious rather than the canonical Dicer-2 partner, R2D2 (ref. 14). Endogenous small interfering RNAs arise both from convergent transcription units and from structured genomic loci in a tissue-specific fashion. They predominantly join Argonaute-2 and have the capacity, as a class, to target both protein-coding genes and mobile elements. These observations expand the repertoire of small RNAs in Drosophila, adding a class that blurs distinctions based on known biogenesis mechanisms and functional roles."
https://openalex.org/W2125734502,"The molecular mechanisms underlying pluripotency and lineage specification from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are largely unclear. Differentiation pathways may be determined by the targeted activation of lineage-specific genes or by selective silencing of genome regions. Here we show that the ESC genome is transcriptionally globally hyperactive and undergoes large-scale silencing as cells differentiate. Normally silent repeat regions are active in ESCs, and tissue-specific genes are sporadically expressed at low levels. Whole-genome tiling arrays demonstrate widespread transcription in coding and noncoding regions in ESCs, whereas the transcriptional landscape becomes more discrete as differentiation proceeds. The transcriptional hyperactivity in ESCs is accompanied by disproportionate expression of chromatin-remodeling genes and the general transcription machinery. We propose that global transcription is a hallmark of pluripotent ESCs, contributing to their plasticity, and that lineage specification is driven by reduction of the transcribed portion of the genome.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are unique in their capacities to self-renew and to initiate differentiation into any cell type of the three germ layers. These opposing abilities are in part brought about by the presence of stem cell-specific factors (Hochedlinger et al., 2005Hochedlinger K. Yamada Y. Beard C. Jaenisch R.

During differentiation, lineage-specific transcription factors activate the expression of specific sets of genes that are required for each specific lineage to form hierarchical transcription networks (Szutorisz and Dillon, 2005Szutorisz H.

Chromatin in pluripotent embryonic stem cells and differentiation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). ESC chromatin is characterized by several specific features, which distinguish it from that of somatic and differentiated cells (Niwa, 2007Niwa H. Open conformation chromatin and pluripotency.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2671-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). ESC chromatin is morphologically distinct in that heterochromatin is organized in larger and fewer domains, which become smaller, more abundant, and hypercondensed as cells differentiate (Aoto et al., 2006Aoto T.

Pathol. 2004; 28: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Another characteristic feature of stem cell chromatin is the altered binding of chromatin proteins (Meshorer et al., 2006Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Architectural chromatin proteins such as the heterochromatin component HP1, the linker histone H1, and core histones display hyperdynamic and looser binding to chromatin in undifferentiated ESCs compared to differentiated cells. Hyperdynamic binding is exclusively found in pluripotent cell types, but not in lineage-committed but undifferentiated cells, indicating that dynamic chromatin is associated with pluripotency rather than differentiation per se (Meshorer et al., 2006Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). ESCs also contain unique histone modification patterns (Spivakov and Fisher, 2007Spivakov M. Fisher A.G. Epigenetic signatures of stem-cell identity.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Extensive regions of the genome are bivalently marked by transcriptionally repressive H3K27me3, but at the same time contain the transcription-associated histone modification H3K4me3 (Azuara et al., 2006Azuara V. Perry P. Sauer S. Spivakov M. Jorgensen H.F. John R.M. Gouti M. Casanova M. Warnes G. Merkenschlager M. et al.Chromatin signatures of pluripotent cell lines.Nat.

Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3740) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these “bivalent” domains silence developmentally regulated genes in ESCs while keeping them poised for activation as cells enter the various differentiation pathways (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M.

Stem cells primed for action: polycomb repressive complexes restrain the expression of lineage-specific regulators in embryonic stem cells.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1411-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Repression of H3K27me3 appears to be mediated by the polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2), which is associated with a significant number of developmental regulators (Boyer et al., 2006bBoyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. et al.Polycomb complexes repress developmental regulators in murine embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2006Lee T.I. Jenner R.G. Boyer L.A. Guenther M.G. Levine S.S. Kumar R.M. Chevalier B. Johnstone S.E. Cole M.F. Isono K. et al.Control of developmental regulators by polycomb in human embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 301-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). A striking commonality among the ESC-specific chromatin properties is that they are all indicative of transcriptionally active chromatin. We have suggested that ESC genomes are globally transcriptionally hyperactive and express large regions of the genome, possibly indiscriminately and at low levels (Meshorer and Misteli, 2006Meshorer E. Misteli T. Chromatin in pluripotent embryonic stem cells and differentiation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Here we have directly tested this hypothesis and demonstrate global, low-level transcriptional activity in the ESC genome. We find elevated levels of total RNA and mRNA in pluripotent mouse ESCs, and we show that undifferentiated ESCs express repetitive sequences, mobile elements, as well as lineage- and tissue-specific genes at low levels. Using whole-genome mouse tiling arrays, we show that a larger fraction of the genome is active in ESCs compared to differentiating cells. The global transcriptional activity of the ESC genome is accompanied by elevated levels of chromatin-remodeling proteins and the global transcription machinery, but not histone-modifying activities. Modulation of several specific chromatin-remodeling activities in ESCs interferes with their proliferation and differentiation. Our results identify global, low-level genome activity as a hallmark of ESC genomes, and they suggest that loss of pluripotency and lineage specification involves reduction of the actively transcribed portion of the genome. ESC chromatin is characterized by several distinct properties. For one, in ESCs, heterochromatin is organized in larger and fewer domains, which become smaller, more abundant, and hypercondensed as cells differentiate (Aoto et al., 2006Aoto T. Saitoh N. Ichimura T. Niwa H. Nakao M. Nuclear and chromatin reorganization in the MHC-Oct3/4 locus at developmental phases of embryonic stem cell differentiation.Dev. Biol. 2006; 298: 354-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Kobayakawa et al., 2007Kobayakawa S. Miike K. Nakao M. Abe K. Dynamic changes in the epigenomic state and nuclear organization of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Meshorer and Misteli, 2006Meshorer E. Misteli T. Chromatin in pluripotent embryonic stem cells and differentiation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2004Park S.H. Kook M.C. Kim E.Y. Park S. Lim J.H. Ultrastructure of human embryonic stem cells and spontaneous and retinoic acid-induced differentiating cells.Ultrastruct. Pathol. 2004; 28: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To characterize the ultrastructure of ESC chromatin, we compared by quantitative electron microscopy undifferentiated mouse R1 ESCs with neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from them by in vitro differentiation (see Figures S1A and S1B available online). Consistent with global decondensation in ESCs, the majority of chromatin appears homogeneous and decondensed in undifferentiated pluripotent cells (Figure S1A, left). In contrast, in R1 NPCs chromatin is heterogeneous in appearance and distinct heterochromatin domains are frequently present (Figure S1A, middle; Meshorer et al., 2006Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). In addition to morphological differences, chromatin in ESCs is molecularly distinguished by a set of bivalent histone modifications of both an active and a repressive state (Azuara et al., 2006Azuara V. Perry P. Sauer S. Spivakov M. Jorgensen H.F. John R.M. Gouti M. Casanova M. Warnes G. Merkenschlager M. et al.Chromatin signatures of pluripotent cell lines.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3740) Google Scholar). To extend these studies, we compared the status of a series of histone modifications in undifferentiated R1 ESCs and NPCs derived from them (Figures S1C and S1D). We find enrichment of several histone marks commonly associated with active chromatin, including H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K36me2, and H3K36me3 in ESCs compared to ESC-derived NPCs (Figures S1C and S1D). The significantly elevated levels of the RNA Pol II-mediated elongation-associated histone modification H3K36me2 (Bannister et al., 2005Bannister A.J. Schneider R. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Spatial distribution of di- and tri-methyl lysine 36 of histone H3 at active genes.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17732-17736Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) (Figure S1C) are further suggestive of increased transcriptional activity in ESCs. The opposite behavior was observed for histone marks associated with transcriptional silencing. H4K20me2 is unchanged, but the heterochromatin-associated modification H3K9me3 is dramatically underrepresented in ESCs (Meshorer et al., 2006Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), consistent with the absence of heterochromatin domains in ESCs (Figures S1A and S1B; Meshorer et al., 2006Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Similarly, a further hallmark of transcriptionally repressed genome regions, DNA methylation of cytidine (5meC) is also significantly reduced in ESCs compared to NPCs (Bibikova et al., 2006Bibikova M. Chudin E. Wu B. Zhou L. Garcia E.W. Liu Y. Shin S. Plaia T.W. Auerbach J.M. Arking D.E. et al.Human embryonic stem cells have a unique epigenetic signature.Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (Figures S1C and S2). The characteristic properties of ESC chromatin, including global decondensation, looser binding of architectural chromatin proteins, and enrichment of active histone modifications, are all hallmarks of transcriptionally active chromatin. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that ESCs are globally transcriptionally more active than differentiated cells (Meshorer and Misteli, 2006Meshorer E. Misteli T. Chromatin in pluripotent embryonic stem cells and differentiation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To directly test this hypothesis, we measured global transcriptional activity by [3H]uridine incorporation (Kimura et al., 2002Kimura H. Sugaya K. Cook P.R. The transcription cycle of RNA polymerase II in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) in undifferentiated ESCs and 7 day NPCs derived from ESCs by in vitro differentiation (Lee et al., 2000Lee S.H. Lumelsky N. Studer L. Auerbach J.M. McKay R.D. Efficient generation of midbrain and hindbrain neurons from mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, Meshorer et al., 2006Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Hyperdynamic plasticity of chromatin proteins in pluripotent embryonic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Strikingly, total RNA and mRNA levels (5%–10% of total RNA) normalized to DNA content were almost 2-fold higher in ESCs compared to NPCs (Figure 1A, p < 0.005 and 0.05, respectively, Mann-Whitney two-tailed test). Higher levels of incorporated [3H]uridine were not due to increased RNA stability in ESCs because RNA decay rates were comparable in ESCs and NPCs as demonstrated by pulse-chase labeling of newly synthesized total RNA (Figure 1B) and mRNA (Figure 1C). The elevated transcriptional activity in undifferentiated ESCs could either be due to the activity of a specific set of genes or might alternatively reflect global activation of the genome in ESCs. To begin to distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the activity status of satellite repeat sequences, LINEs, SINEs, and several retrotransposons (Martens et al., 2005Martens J.H. O'Sullivan R.J. Braunschweig U. Opravil S. Radolf M. Steinlein P. Jenuwein T. The profile of repeat-associated histone lysine methylation states in the mouse epigenome.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), which are normally repressed in differentiated cells. Transcription of all elements, including major and minor satellite repeats, LINEs, and SINEs, was significantly higher in ESCs than in ESC-derived NPCs (Figure 1D; p < 0.05; normalized to the constantly expressed Cyclophilin-B mRNA). While these elements were detected at low levels in NPCs, their expression was increased by 2- to 10-fold in ESCs (Figure 1D). We obtained similar results when undifferentiated ESCs were compared to other cell types, such as MEFs or differentiated C2C12 muscle cells (data not shown). To exclude the trivial possibility that the detection of these transcripts by RT-PCR was due to their expression in only a small subpopulation of cells in the ESC population, we visualized major satellite repeat expression in undifferentiated (Figure 1E, ESC) and differentiated (Figure 1E, NPC) ESCs by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Expression of major satellite repeats was detected in 83 ± 23% of the undifferentiated ESCs but only in 23 ± 11% of NPCs (Figure 1E). When ESCs were pretreated with RNase, the signal was abolished (Figure 1E, +RNase), whereas DNase treatment left the signal intact (Figure 1E, +DNase). These results show that undifferentiated ESCs express regions of the genome that are normally silenced in differentiated cells. To ask whether transcription of silent genome regions was limited to repeat sequences or was a general property of the ESC genome, we probed the transcription status of specific genes using RT-PCR. We selected several tissue-specific genes and genes associated with terminal differentiation, which are not expected to be expressed in undifferentiated ESCs (Table S1). In order to avoid false positives originating from DNA contamination, all PCR primers were designed to flank long introns, so that the genomic products would be significantly longer than the cDNA products (Table S1). Transcripts for 11 out of 12 lineage-restricted genes were detected in undifferentiated ESCs (Figure 1F). The transcription level of these genes was very low, with an estimated 0.25–20 copies per cell as determined by direct comparison with known quantities of plasmid cDNA (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), suggesting their transcription likely occurs stochastically within the population. The low abundance prevented accurate quantification by real-time PCR in most cases, and some required reamplification (Figure S3A). However, in the cases for which we were able to quantitatively compare transcription levels in ESCs, 7 day NPCs, and ESC-derived fully differentiated postmitotic neurons (PMNs) by quantitative real-time PCR, transcription levels decreased during differentiation (Figure S3B). In 7 day NPCs, 8 of 12 genes were still detected, but this number dropped to 5 in PMNs (Figure 1F). As a control, we tested several differentiated cell lines. Most of the genes analyzed were silenced in MEFs and C2C12 muscle cells, except the ones specific to that particular lineage, such as Acta1 and Myogenin in C2C12 cells and SPRR2A in MEFs. Interestingly, comparison with publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by genomic sequencing (ChIP-seq) data (Mikkelsen et al., 2007Mikkelsen T.S. Ku M. Jaffe D.B. Issac B. Lieberman E. Giannoukos G. Alvarez P. Brockman W. Kim T.K. Koche R.P. et al.Genome-wide maps of chromatin state in pluripotent and lineage-committed cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar) revealed that all detected genes (except SPRR2A, for which ChIP data were not available) were marked with higher levels of both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in undifferentiated ESCs than in NPCs, and the H3K27me3:H3K4me3 ratio increased following differentiation (Figures S4A and S4B), supporting increased silencing of lineage-specific genes in the differentiated state. Attempts to detect protein products from these transcripts using western blotting yielded negative results (data not shown). To systematically assess the transcriptional status of the entire genome and to extend our analysis to noncoding genome regions, we used an Affymetrix whole-genome mouse tiling array at 30 bp resolution to compare genome-wide transcription profiles in pluripotent ESCs and in ESC-derived NPCs (see the Experimental Procedures for details). Microarray analysis was validated by the detection of downregulation of several stem cell-specific genes, including Oct4 and Sox15, during differentiation, whereas expression of neuronal genes, including Sox4 and Sox11 (Bergsland et al., 2006Bergsland M. Werme M. Malewicz M. Perlmann T. Muhr J. The establishment of neuronal properties is controlled by Sox4 and Sox11.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3475-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), was increased as confirmed by qPCR (Figures S5A and S5B). The tissue-specific transcripts detected in ESCs by RT-PCR showed low-level or no transcription on the tiling array, indicating the sensitivity limits of the microarray (Figure S5C). A detailed list of gene and transcript lengths, untranslated region (UTR) length, and their average lengths are given in Table S2. To ask whether the genome of undifferentiated ESCs is globally transcriptionally more active, we first compared the number of positive probes on microarrays hybridized with poly(A)+ RNA from ESCs or from ESC-derived 7 day NPCs. We used the number of single positive probes as a general surrogate for transcriptional activity. In support of increased global transcriptional activity in ESCs, the number of positive probes was significantly elevated in ESCs compared to NPCs. While in ESCs, 1,041,879 probes displayed intensity values above threshold (defined as 90% noise level, calculated using the mismatch probes data; see the Experimental Procedures for details); this number was reduced to 838,787 positive probes in NPCs, corresponding to an ∼20% decrease (p < 10−5, two-tailed Student's t test). The number of reduced probes is an underestimate because equal amounts of RNA rather than RNA from equal number of cells were hybridized and only RNAs of more than 200 nt transcripts in length were purified for use in hybridization. In addition, a stringent threshold was used to avoid measurements of false-positive probes. The reduction of detected probes occurred across all regions of the genome, including intergenic (Figure 2A), intronic (Figure 2B), and exonic (Figure 2C) domains. Importantly, the reduction was evident as early as 24 hr after the withdrawal of LIF, demonstrating that the reduction in transcriptional activity is not restricted to a particular lineage and was not due to more rapid proliferation of undifferentiated ESCs, because ESCs after 24 hr withdrawal of LIF are still highly proliferative. The degree of reduction varied among chromosomes but was typically between 20% and 50% in NPCs (Figure 2). Global transcriptional reduction was most prominent in intergenic and intronic regions. In these regions, probe counts were significantly reduced in 9–15 of the 21 chromosomes by 24 hr and in 12–17 of the 21 chromosomes by 7 days. The remaining chromosomes did not show significant changes (Figures 2A and 2B). In exonic regions, 5 chromosomes displayed reductions at the 24 hr time point and 11 chromosomes showed reduced counts in NPCs (Figure 2C). Interestingly, in NPCs 2 chromosomes (1 and 12) showed significantly elevated counts in exonic regions only. These are likely due to a disproportionately high number of differentiation-induced genes on these chromosomes, including Sox11, Sox17, and many others (Table S3). The overall reduction of active probes was not due to elevated levels of ribosomal genes, as the rDNA-bearing chromosomal regions are not represented on the array. To verify that the elevated number of probes in ESCs was not due to increased background noise, we analyzed the distribution of the probes that were exclusively present in ESCs but not in NPCs. Slightly more than 50% of probes were clustered in groups of three or longer, corresponding to 100 bp or longer transcripts (Figure S6). Comparison of the size distribution of the positive probes with a random distribution using computer-assisted statistical simulations suggested that they were contiguous transcripts (p < 10−6). The more global transcriptional activity in ESCs was also evident from inspection of selected intergenic and intronic regions (Figure 3). Some intergenic regions in ESCs exhibited “transcription bursts” displaying intermittent active and silent regions, which were reduced to near threshold levels in NPCs (Figure 3A). In other cases, intergenic regions were active over large contiguous stretches in ESCs and activity was dramatically reduced over the entire region in NPCs (Figure 3B). Some regions were characterized by “transcriptional islands” in which parts of a region were active in both ESCs and NPCs (Figure 3C). Significant transcription occurred in many cases along entire introns in ESCs (Figure 3D) or was often confined to a limited region of varying extent within the intron in ESCs, but was significantly reduced in NPCs (Figures 3E and 3F). These reductions were specific, as numerous intronic regions were more highly expressed in NPCs (Figure 3F). These analyses of intronic and intergenic regions point to a widespread elevated genomic transcriptional activity in undifferentiated ESCs. Inspection of regions that were active both in ESCs and in NPCs often indicated higher transcription levels in ESCs (Figure 3E), suggesting that the increased overall transcription level might not only be due to additional active regions, but also generally higher levels of transcription in constitutively active regions. To test this possibility, we analyzed the expression level of all probes that wer"
https://openalex.org/W2005124332,"Plant stem-cell pools, the source for all organs, are first established during embryogenesis. It has been known for decades that cytokinin and auxin interact to control organ regeneration in cultured tissue. Auxin has a critical role in root stem-cell specification in zygotic embryogenesis, but the early embryonic function of cytokinin is obscure. Here, we introduce a synthetic reporter to visualize universally cytokinin output in vivo. Notably, the first embryonic signal is detected in the hypophysis, the founder cell of the root stem-cell system. Its apical daughter cell, the precursor of the quiescent centre, maintains phosphorelay activity, whereas the basal daughter cell represses signalling output. Auxin activity levels, however, exhibit the inverse profile. Furthermore, we show that auxin antagonizes cytokinin output in the basal cell lineage by direct transcriptional activation of ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR genes, ARR7 and ARR15, feedback repressors of cytokinin signalling. Loss of ARR7 and ARR15 function or ectopic cytokinin signalling in the basal cell during early embryogenesis results in a defective root stem-cell system. These results provide a molecular model of transient and antagonistic interaction between auxin and cytokinin critical for specifying the first root stem-cell niche."

In this work, Okamura et al. show that the Drosophila genome encodes endogenous siRNAs. Derived from long RNA hairpin genes, these siRNAs downregulate protein expression. Their processing pathway from the hairpin into the mature 21-nucleodite long siRNA involves factors of two pathways thought to be distinct. This paper shows that the Drosophila genome encodes endogenous siRNAs. Derived from long hairpin RNA genes, these siRNAs downregulate protein expression. Their processing pathway from the hairpin into the mature ∼21-nucleotide siRNA involves factors of two pathways thought to be distinct. In contrast to microRNAs and Piwi-associated RNAs, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are seemingly dispensable for host-directed gene regulation in Drosophila. This notion is based on the fact that mutants lacking the core siRNA-generating enzyme Dicer-2 or the predominant siRNA effector Argonaute 2 are viable, fertile and of relatively normal morphology1,2. Moreover, endogenous Drosophila siRNAs have not yet been identified. Here we report that siRNAs derived from long hairpin RNA genes (hpRNAs) programme Slicer complexes that can repress endogenous target transcripts. The Drosophila hpRNA pathway is a hybrid mechanism that combines canonical RNA interference factors (Dicer-2, Hen1 (known as CG12367) and Argonaute 2) with a canonical microRNA factor (Loquacious) to generate ∼21-nucleotide siRNAs. These novel regulatory RNAs reveal unexpected complexity in the sorting of small RNAs, and open a window onto the biological usage of endogenous RNA interference in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2027964838,"Proper partitioning of the contents of a cell between two daughters requires integration of spatial and temporal cues. The anaphase array of microtubules that self-organize at the spindle midzone contributes to positioning the cell-division plane midway between the segregating chromosomes. How this signalling occurs over length scales of micrometres, from the midzone to the cell cortex, is not known. Here we examine the anaphase dynamics of protein phosphorylation by aurora B kinase, a key mitotic regulator, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors in living HeLa cells and immunofluorescence of native aurora B substrates. Quantitative analysis of phosphorylation dynamics, using chromosome- and centromere-targeted sensors, reveals that changes are due primarily to position along the division axis rather than time. These dynamics result in the formation of a spatial phosphorylation gradient early in anaphase that is centred at the spindle midzone. This gradient depends on aurora B targeting to a subpopulation of microtubules that activate it. Aurora kinase activity organizes the targeted microtubules to generate a structure-based feedback loop. We propose that feedback between aurora B kinase activation and midzone microtubules generates a gradient of post-translational marks that provides spatial information for events in anaphase and cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2049047355,"A significant fraction of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is transcribed periodically during the cell division cycle, indicating that properly timed gene expression is important for regulating cell-cycle events. Genomic analyses of the localization and expression dynamics of transcription factors suggest that a network of sequentially expressed transcription factors could control the temporal programme of transcription during the cell cycle. However, directed studies interrogating small numbers of genes indicate that their periodic transcription is governed by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). To determine the extent to which the global cell-cycle transcription programme is controlled by cyclin-CDK complexes, we examined genome-wide transcription dynamics in budding yeast mutant cells that do not express S-phase and mitotic cyclins. Here we show that a significant fraction of periodic genes are aberrantly expressed in the cyclin mutant. Although cells lacking cyclins are blocked at the G1/S border, nearly 70% of periodic genes continued to be expressed periodically and on schedule. Our findings reveal that although CDKs have a function in the regulation of cell-cycle transcription, they are not solely responsible for establishing the global periodic transcription programme. We propose that periodic transcription is an emergent property of a transcription factor network that can function as a cell-cycle oscillator independently of, and in tandem with, the CDK oscillator."
https://openalex.org/W2082664445,"FLK1-expressing (FLK1(+)) mesoderm generates blood and vessels. Here, we show that combined BMP, Notch, and Wnt signaling is necessary for efficient FLK1(+) mesoderm formation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Inhibition of BMP, Notch, and Wnt signaling pathways greatly decreased the generation of FLK1(+) mesoderm and expression of the Ets transcription factor Er71. Enforced expression of ER71 in ESCs resulted in a robust induction of FLK1(+) mesoderm; rescued the generation of FLK1(+) mesoderm when blocked by BMP, Notch, and Wnt inhibition; and enhanced hematopoietic and endothelial cell generation. Er71-deficient mice had greatly reduced FLK1 expression, died early in gestation, and displayed severe blood and vessel defects that are highly reminiscent of the Flk1 null mouse phenotype. Collectively, we provide compelling evidence that ER71 functions downstream of BMP, Notch, and Wnt signals and regulates FLK1(+) mesoderm, blood, and vessel development."
https://openalex.org/W2084521437,"Stem cell differentiation involves changes in transcription, but little is known about translational control during differentiation. We comprehensively profiled gene expression during differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into embryoid bodies by integrating transcriptome analysis with global assessment of ribosome loading. While protein synthesis was parsimonious during self-renewal, differentiation induced an anabolic switch, with global increases in transcript abundance, polysome content, protein synthesis, and protein content. Furthermore, 78% of transcripts showed increased ribosome loading, thereby enhancing translational efficiency. Transcripts under exclusive translational control included the transcription factor ATF5, the tumor suppressor DCC, and the beta-catenin agonist Wnt1. We show that a hierarchy of translational regulators, including mTOR, 4EBP1, and the RNA-binding proteins DAZL and GRSF1, control global and selective protein synthesis during ESC differentiation. Parsimonious translation in pluripotent state and hierarchical translational regulation during differentiation may be important quality controls for self-renewal and choice of fate in ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2068499405,"Background Eukaryotic cells are large enough to detect signals and then orient to them by differentiating the signal strength across the length and breadth of the cell. Amoebae, fibroblasts, neutrophils and growth cones all behave in this way. Little is known however about cell motion and searching behavior in the absence of a signal. Is individual cell motion best characterized as a random walk? Do individual cells have a search strategy when they are beyond the range of the signal they would otherwise move toward? Here we ask if single, isolated, Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium amoebae bias their motion in the absence of external cues. Methodology We placed single well-isolated Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium cells on a nutrient-free agar surface and followed them at 10 sec intervals for ∼10 hr, then analyzed their motion with respect to velocity, turning angle, persistence length, and persistence time, comparing the results to the expectation for a variety of different types of random motion. Conclusions We find that amoeboid behavior is well described by a special kind of random motion: Amoebae show a long persistence time (∼10 min) beyond which they start to lose their direction; they move forward in a zig-zag manner; and they make turns every 1–2 min on average. They bias their motion by remembering the last turn and turning away from it. Interpreting the motion as consisting of runs and turns, the duration of a run and the amplitude of a turn are both found to be exponentially distributed. We show that this behavior greatly improves their chances of finding a target relative to performing a random walk. We believe that other eukaryotic cells may employ a strategy similar to Dictyostelium when seeking conditions or signal sources not yet within range of their detection system."
https://openalex.org/W2005995704,"Cancer stem cells, which share many common properties and regulatory machineries with normal stem cells, have recently been proposed to be responsible for tumorigenesis and to contribute to cancer resistance. The main challenges in cancer biology are to identify cancer stem cells and to define the molecular events required for transforming normal cells to cancer stem cells. Here we show that Pten deletion in mouse haematopoietic stem cells leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, followed by acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Self-renewable leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) are enriched in the c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) compartment, where unphosphorylated beta-catenin is significantly increased. Conditional ablation of one allele of the beta-catenin gene substantially decreases the incidence and delays the occurrence of T-ALL caused by Pten loss, indicating that activation of the beta-catenin pathway may contribute to the formation or expansion of the LSC population. Moreover, a recurring chromosomal translocation, T(14;15), results in aberrant overexpression of the c-myc oncogene in c-Kit(mid)CD3(+)Lin(-) LSCs and CD3(+) leukaemic blasts, recapitulating a subset of human T-ALL. No alterations in Notch1 signalling are detected in this model, suggesting that Pten inactivation and c-myc overexpression may substitute functionally for Notch1 abnormalities, leading to T-ALL development. Our study indicates that multiple genetic or molecular alterations contribute cooperatively to LSC transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2094783645,"Self-renewal is a defining characteristic of stem cells; however, the molecular pathways underlying its regulation are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that conditional inactivation of the Pbx1 proto-oncogene in the hematopoietic compartment results in a progressive loss of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) that is associated with concomitant reduction in their quiescence, leading to a defect in the maintenance of self-renewal as assessed by serial transplantation. Transcriptional profiling revealed that multiple stem cell maintenance factors are perturbed in Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs, which prematurely express a large subset of genes, including cell-cycle regulators, normally expressed in non-self-renewing multipotent progenitors. A significant proportion of Pbx1-dependent genes is associated with the TGF-beta pathway, which serves a major role in maintaining HSC quiescence. Prospectively isolated, Pbx1-deficient LT-HSCs display altered transcriptional responses to TGF-beta stimulation in vitro, suggesting a possible mechanism through which Pbx1 maintenance of stem cell quiescence may in part be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2035706478,"Background Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative and cardiac disease, is caused by abnormally low levels of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein. All Friedreich ataxia patients carry a GAA⋅TTC repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene, either in the homozygous state or in compound heterozygosity with other loss-of-function mutations. The GAA expansion inhibits frataxin expression through a heterochromatin-mediated repression mechanism. Histone modifications that are characteristic of silenced genes in heterochromatic regions occur at expanded alleles in cells from Friedreich ataxia patients, including increased trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and hypoacetylation of histones H3 and H4. Methodology/Principal Findings By chromatin immunoprecipitation, we detected the same heterochromatin marks in homozygous mice carrying a (GAA)230 repeat in the first intron of the mouse frataxin gene (KIKI mice). These animals have decreased frataxin levels and, by microarray analysis, show significant gene expression changes in several tissues. We treated KIKI mice with a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, compound 106, which substantially increases frataxin mRNA levels in cells from Friedreich ataxia individuals. Treatment increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in chromatin near the GAA repeat and restored wild-type frataxin levels in the nervous system and heart, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR and semiquantitative western blot analysis. No toxicity was observed. Furthermore, most of the differentially expressed genes in KIKI mice reverted towards wild-type levels. Conclusions/Significance Lack of acute toxicity, normalization of frataxin levels and of the transcription profile changes resulting from frataxin deficiency provide strong support to a possible efficacy of this or related compounds in reverting the pathological process in Friedreich ataxia, a so far incurable neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W1978060081,"The reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) catalyses a series of reactions to convert the single-stranded RNA genome of HIV into double-stranded DNA for host-cell integration. This task requires the reverse transcriptase to discriminate a variety of nucleic-acid substrates such that active sites of the enzyme are correctly positioned to support one of three catalytic functions: RNA-directed DNA synthesis, DNA-directed DNA synthesis and DNA-directed RNA hydrolysis. However, the mechanism by which substrates regulate reverse transcriptase activities remains unclear. Here we report distinct orientational dynamics of reverse transcriptase observed on different substrates with a single-molecule assay. The enzyme adopted opposite binding orientations on duplexes containing DNA or RNA primers, directing its DNA synthesis or RNA hydrolysis activity, respectively. On duplexes containing the unique polypurine RNA primers for plus-strand DNA synthesis, the enzyme can rapidly switch between the two orientations. The switching kinetics were regulated by cognate nucleotides and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a major class of anti-HIV drugs. These results indicate that the activities of reverse transcriptase are determined by its binding orientation on substrates. The human immunodeficiency virus encodes an essential protein called reverse transcriptase, a primary drug target for the treatment of AIDS. It has two activities: synthesis of DNA using the viral RNA genome as a template, and cleavage of a DNA-RNA hybrid. Each activity requires the enzyme to bind to both DNA and RNA. But how does it know which activity to perform on which substrate? The use of single-molecule technology shows that the enzyme binds to RNA and DNA in different orientations, and can flip between these orientations and activities without parting from the substrate. The flipping dynamics are strongly regulated by non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a major class of anti-HIV drug, suggesting a mechanism by which these drugs inhibit viral replication. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is an important drug target. RT has two activities, DNA synthesis, and cleavage of a DNA–RNA hybrid. These activities require that RT bind to both DNA and RNA. Single-molecule technology is used to show that the enzyme binds to RNA and DNA in different orientations, and provide insight into how it can flip between these orientations and activities without dissociating from the substrate."

We implemented a study of the feasibility and efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene to reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households (composed of at least 3 members) where an index subject presented with influenza-like-illness of <48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) surgical face masks or 3) hand hygiene. Households were visited within 36 hours, and 3, 6 and 9 days later. Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture. The primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza (by self-reported symptoms). We randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6%. Clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5% to 18% depending on case definitions. The laboratory-based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms. Adherence to interventions was variable. Conclusions/Significance The secondary attack ratios were lower than anticipated, and lower than reported in other countries, perhaps due to differing patterns of susceptibility, lack of significant antigenic drift in circulating influenza virus strains recently, and/or issues related to the symptomatic recruitment design.

Despite extensive characterization and the predominant nuclear localization of HuR, the idea that this protein functions as splicing regulator remains unclear because no target sequences of HuR have been identified.

HuR siRNA-mediated Depletion Promotes Fas Exon 6 Inclusion—HuR is an RNA-binding protein mainly localized in the nucleus of HeLa cells (>90%), with nucleolar exclusion, whereas TIA-1 and TIAR showed a characteristic nuclear-cytoplasmic localization pattern (Fig. 1, A-C). However, both endogenous and ectopic HuR and TIA-1 proteins showed similar nuclear colocalization (Fig. 1, A-C), suggesting that they might have related functions in nuclear events such as, for example, the control of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. To test this idea, I reduced the abundance of endogenous HuR in HeLa cells (80-90%) by RNA interference, resulting in increased levels of Fas exon 6 inclusion (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 2-4 with lanes 1-3, respectively). In these experiments, to detect reliable differences in exon 6 inclusion, I have used a Fas minigene harboring a mutation at the polypyrimidine tract of intron 5 (Fas U-20C) that increases exon 6 skipping (10Izquierdo J.M.

To exclude off-target siRNA effects, I used an siRNA-resistant variant of HuR, refractory to the siRNA directed to the 3′-untranslated region of HuR, in line with previous data (33Izquierdo J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the resistant protein can provide the full range of their activity even under silencing conditions (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 2, 4, and 5 with lanes 1, 3, and 4, respectively), thus strongly arguing that HuR does promote exon 6 skipping. These results suggest that HuR might function as a Fas exon 6 splicing repressor.FIGURE 2HuR represses Fas exon 6 inclusion through the URE6 exonic silencer.

HuR overexpression over wild type (WT) Fas minigene promoted exon 6 skipping (Fig. 2, C and D, compare lane 1 with lane 4), indicating that HuR down-regulates exon 6 inclusion. Nevertheless, the mutant m0 minigene, with replacement of a uridine-rich sequence on exon 6 (URE6), was fully insensitive to equivalent levels of HuR overexpression (Fig. 2, C and D, compare lane 2 with lane 5). In these studies, TIAR overexpression and the effects on U-20C and mURI6 reporter minigenes were used as positive and negative controls of exon 6 inclusion and skipping, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 3 and 6-9). I conclude that HuR recruitment to the URE6 sequence induces Fas exon 6 skipping. To further document HuR function through the URE6 element, this sequence was substituted for two MS2 stem-loop binding sites in tandem for the bacteriophage MS2 protein (Fas 2xMS2 minigene) (10Izquierdo J.M. Majós N. Bonnal S. Martínez C. Castelo R. Guigó R. Bilbao D. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cotransfection with a plasmid expressing an MS2-HuR fusion protein led to significant exon 6 skipping (Fig. 2E, lane 4), whereas expression of GFP or MS2 proteins did not (Fig. 2E, lanes 1 and 2). As I described previously (10Izquierdo J.M. Majós N. Bonnal S. Martínez C. Castelo R. Guigó R. Bilbao D. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), expression of an MS2-PTB fusion protein also led to efficient exon 6 skipping (Fig. 2E, lane 3). However, the URE6 substitution rendered the minigene insensitive to PTB or HuR overexpression (Fig. 2E, lanes 5 and 6). The simplest interpretation of all these results is that URE6 sequence silences exon 6 inclusion in a HuR-dependent way. Fas Splicing Regulation in Vivo and in Vitro by HuR and TIA-1/TIAR Antagonism—Given that antagonism between TIA-1 and HuB/HuC/HuD proteins has been reported previously (15Zhu H. Hasman R.A. Barron V.A. Luo G. Lou H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 5105-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), in vivo splicing experiments in HeLa cells were performed by cotransfection of WT or m0 Fas minigenes and plasmids expressing GFP, HuR alone, or HuR with TIA-1 or TIAR (Fig. 3). Exon 6 skipping by HuR overexpression was rescued by the simple overexpression of equivalent levels of TIA-1 or TIAR proteins (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 6 and 7), whereas m0 minigene was refractory to the HuR overexpression (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5). These results point to functional antagonism between TIA-1/TIAR and HuR proteins. In vitro splicing assays were then done to assess whether the effects of HuR and TIA-1/TIAR observed ex vivo are direct. In vitro-transcribed RNA corresponding to Fas genomic sequences between exons 5 and 6 plus 30 nucleotides of intron 6 were incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts under splicing conditions. ATP-dependent accumulation of the product containing exons 5 and 6 was observed (Fig. 3C, lane 2). In line with transfection data, the addition of purified recombinant HuR abolished accumulation of 5-6 spliced product (Fig. 3C, lanes 3-5), whereas additional supplementation of purified recombinant TIA-1 or TIAR (data not shown) rescued product accumulation (Fig. 3C, lanes 6 and 7). Most of the effects observed previously (Figs. 2, D and E, and 3B) were detectable and recapitulated with the m0 mutant containing mutation of URE6 sequence. For example, this mutant remained insensitive to HuR excess (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2 and 9 with lane 10). Similarly, the addition of purified recombinant PTB reduced the 5-6 spliced product (Fig. 3C, lane 12), whereas the m0 mutant was insensitive to PTB excess (Fig. 3C, lane 13). Overall, the results recapitulate the effects of cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors observed ex vivo and indicate that HuR acts directly through the exonic silencer URE6. Interaction between HuR and URE6—To confirm that HuR binds to the exonic silencer URE6, RNA binding assays were done. Cross-linking assays with an RNA corresponding to Fas exon 6 (E6 WT) indicated that the addition of purified recombinant HuR supplemented with HeLa nuclear extracts results in a significant increase in HuR cross-linking, without affecting the overall pattern of cross-linking of other proteins (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 3), whereas mutation of the URE6 sequence (E6 m0) reduced HuR cross-linking 5-10-fold (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). This preferential binding to the URE6-containing RNA was also observed in UV-cross-linking plus immunoprecipitation assays. In fact, HuR present in HeLa nuclear extracts was cross-linked to the radioactively labeled WT RNA corresponding to the Fas exon 6 followed by HuR immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B, lane 2), and this cross-linking was significantly reduced by mutation of the URE6 sequence (Fig. 4B, lane 4). These results indicate that HuR binds to the URE6 sequence. Additionally, purified recombinant HuR was incubated with RNAs corresponding to the WT or m0 Fas exon 6 (Fig. 4C). HuR binding was significantly reduced (4-5-fold) by mutation of the URE6 sequence (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1-6 with lanes 7-12). This result indicates that HuR binds directly to URE6. In line with the function of Hu proteins in other RNAs (35Gao F.B. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 579-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fialcowitz-White E.J. Brewer B.Y. Ballin J.D. Willis C.D. Toth E.A. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20948-20959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), my results showed cooperative HuR binding to Fas RNA substrates since the fastest migrating HuR-RNA complexes accumulate according to protein concentration, rather than sequentially (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that the URE6 sequence can function as a high affinity site facilitating HuR recruitment and favoring multimerization. Mechanism of Fas Splicing Regulation by HuR—Fas intron 5 splicing is completely dependent on the presence of the 5′ splice site of intron 6 and downstream sequences as well as recognition of these sequences by U1 snRNP and TIA-1/TIAR, which facilitate exon definition and splicing of the upstream intron (10Izquierdo J.M. Majós N. Bonnal S. Martínez C. Castelo R. Guigó R. Bilbao D. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Given that HuR can form multimers and so alter recognition of the sequences at the 5′ splice site in intron 6, I analyzed the effect on psoralen-mediated cross-linking between U1 snRNA and the 5′ splice site region of Fas exon 6 when adding recombinant purified HuR protein to nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 4D, excess HuR did not diminish but rather increased interaction between U1 snRNA and 5′ splice site (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 1 and 5 with lanes 4 and 8, respectively). This analysis was repeated with PTB as a positive control (Fig. 4D, compare lanes 1 and 5 with lanes 3 and 7, respectively). However, U1 snRNA binding to the 5′ splice site sequence was clearly reduced in extracts with U1 snRNP inactivated by RNase H-mediated digestion of U1 snRNA 5′ end (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 6). I conclude that HuR stabilizes U1 snRNP recruitment to the 5′ splice site of exon 6. I have previously shown that Fas intron 5 splicing was facilitated by an exon definition phenomenon, probably due to stabilization of U2AF binding mediated by U1 snRNP association with the downstream 5′ splice site across the exon (3Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar, 37Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, U2AF65 cross-linking was abolished in the absence of a 5′ splice site (Fig. 4E, lane 6) and in the presence of excess HuR (Fig. 4E, lane 4) at levels equivalent to those corresponding to affinity chromatography U2AF-depleted extract (Fig. 4E, lane 5). U2AF65 cross-linking was also reduced in the presence of PTB (Fig. 4E, lane 3) as well as in extracts in which U1 snRNP was inactivated by RNase H-mediated digestion of U1 snRNA 5′end (Fig. 4E, lane 2). Furthermore, I demonstrated that inhibition of association of U2AF65 with the 3′ splice site by HuR occurs in an URE6-dependent manner since this association is re-established with m0 mutant (Fig. 4F, lanes 1-3). Finally, I tested whether the residual cross-linking of U2AF65 observed in the absence of the 5′ splice site of intron 6 (not mediated by exon definition) was inhibited by HuR. In the absence of intron 6 sequences, U2AF65 cross-linking did not depend on the integrity of U1 snRNA (Fig. 4F, lane 5). Remarkably, U2AF65 cross-linking was completely inhibited by HuR (Fig. 4F, lane 7) but not by PTB (Fig. 4F, lane 6; the stronger background is due to the longer exposure required to detect the low levels of U2AF65 cross-linking in the absence of a 5′ splice site). Taken together, these results indicate that HuR binding to the URE6 element interferes with U2AF65 association with the 3′ splice site region and suggest that HuR inhibition mainly requires the 5′ splice site of intron 6 (i.e. interactions across the exon that stabilize U2AF65 binding to the 3′ splice site on recognition of the 5′ splice site by U1 snRNP) and a direct interaction with the U2AF65 binding site. I conclude that HuR can mediate Fas splicing repression through its capacity to interfere in exon definition. RRM1 and Hinge-RRM3 Domains of HuR Are Necessary and Sufficient to Promote Exon 6 Exclusion—Human HuR protein is made up of two RRMs arranged in tandem near the N terminus followed by a basic hinge domain and a third RRM near the C terminus (14Ma W.J.

https://openalex.org/W2066992828,"Atrazine (ATR) remains a widely used broadleaf herbicide in the United States despite the fact that this s-chlorotriazine has been linked to reproductive abnormalities in fish and amphibians. Here, using zebrafish we report that environmentally relevant ATR concentrations elevated zcyp19a1 expression encoding aromatase (2.2 µg/L), and increased the ratio of female to male fish (22 µg/L). ATR selectively increased zcyp19a1, a known gene target of the nuclear receptor SF-1 (NR5A1), whereas zcyp19a2, which is estrogen responsive, remained unchanged. Remarkably, in mammalian cells ATR functions in a cell-specific manner to upregulate SF-1 targets and other genes critical for steroid synthesis and reproduction, including Cyp19A1, StAR, Cyp11A1, hCG, FSTL3, LHß, INHα, αGSU, and 11ß-HSD2. Our data appear to eliminate the possibility that ATR directly affects SF-1 DNA- or ligand-binding. Instead, we suggest that the stimulatory effects of ATR on the NR5A receptor subfamily (SF-1, LRH-1, and zff1d) are likely mediated by receptor phosphorylation, amplification of cAMP and PI3K signaling, and possibly an increase in the cAMP-responsive cellular kinase SGK-1, which is known to be upregulated in infertile women. Taken together, we propose that this pervasive and persistent environmental chemical alters hormone networks via convergence of NR5A activity and cAMP signaling, to potentially disrupt normal endocrine development and function in lower and higher vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2069278965,"Psychologically, females are usually thought to be superior in interpersonal sensitivity than males. The human mirror-neuron system is considered to provide the basic mechanism for social cognition. However, whether the human mirror-neuron system exhibits gender differences is not yet clear.We measured the electroencephalographic mu rhythm, as a reliable indicator of the human mirror-neuron system activity, when female (N = 20) and male (N = 20) participants watched either hand actions or a moving dot. The display of the hand actions included androgynous, male, and female characteristics. The results demonstrate that females displayed significantly stronger mu suppression than males when watching hand actions. Instead, mu suppression was similar across genders when participants observed the moving dot and between the perceived sex differences (same-sex vs. opposite-sex). In addition, the mu suppressions during the observation of hand actions positively correlated with the personal distress subscale of the interpersonal reactivity index and negatively correlated with the systemizing quotient.The present findings indirectly lend support to the extreme male brain theory put forward by Baron-Cohen (2005), and may cast some light on the mirror-neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders. The mu rhythm in the human mirror-neuron system can be a potential biomarker of empathic mimicry."

Thousands of GPCRs mediate signals through a limited number of G-protein subtypes, such as Gs, Gi/o/t/z, or Gq/11, whose activation in cellular signaling pathways result in up- or down-regulation of cAMP or activation of the phosphoinositol cascade, respectively (2Elefsinioti A.L.

Several GPCR subtypes recognize the same intrinsic ligand such as adrenaline, histamine, or serotonin, and each subtype transduces the same extracellular stimulus to different G subtypes.

Using software based on hidden Markov models, such as 3D-Coffee and PRED-COUPLE, phylogenetic analyses can distinguish the G-protein specificity of each GPCR, and the G-protein subtype coupled to each GPCR can be classified (3Sgourakis N.G.

Bovine rhodopsin couples to transducin Gt, a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein in the Gi/o/t/z subtype, and down-regulates cGMP but not cAMP (31McLauhlin S.K. McKinnon P.J. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1992; 357: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Bovine rhodopsin was previously the only structure-determined GPCR at high resolution in the tetragonal and trigonal crystal forms (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori. T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H.

Recently, the structures of the human β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) coupling to Gs were determined in a complex with a monoclonal antibody Fab fragment to the third cytoplasmic loop (CL3) and a chimeric form whose entire CL3 region was replaced by T4 lysozyme (7Rasmussen S.G.

GPCRs have seven structurally conserved transmembrane helices (TH1–TH7) with various post-translational modifications including N-terminal acetylation, N-glycosylation, palmitoylation, and phosphorylation. Both the N-terminal and the C-terminal tails as well as the extracellular and cytoplasmic loop regions (EL1–EL3 and CL1–CL3, respectively) have low sequence homology. Although the extracellular ligand-binding regions are quite distinct, there is the same amphipathic short helix H8 in both bovine rhodopsin and β2AR (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori. T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar, 8Cherezov V. Rosenbaum D.M.

The GPCR cytoplasmic region, including the C-terminal tail, should have a structure capable of simultaneously discriminating between G-protein subtypes and activating conserved G-proteins. Some activated GPCRs such as BLT1 can promiscuously activate more than two G subtypes, Gi and Gq (3Sgourakis N.G. Bagos P.G. Hamodrakas S.J. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 4101-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Murakami M. Kitahara R. Gotoh T. Kouyama T. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2007; 63: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Squid rhodopsin couples to bovine Gt as well as the intrinsic Gq (11Sail H.R. Michel-Villaz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5111-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Terakita A. Yamashita T. Tachibanaki S. Shichida Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, structural information on novel GPCR recognition and coupling to G subtypes would be indispensable for elucidating the recognition and activation mechanisms for each G-protein. Here, we report the unique crystal structure of Gq coupling rhodopsin from the Japanese flying squid at 3.7 Å resolution in an orthorhombic crystal, as well as confirmation of its chemical structure and post-translational modifications. Purification of Squid Rhodopsin—All procedures were carried out at room temperature in the dark or under dim red light unless otherwise indicated. Squid rhodopsin was prepared from Todarodes pacificus caught in the Japan Sea, using previously described methods (13Kito Y. Seki T. Hagins F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 44-48Google Scholar). Briefly, the rhabdomeric membranes were isolated from squid retina by repetitive sucrose flotation. The membranes were treated with V8 protease (Pierce, 50:1 w/w of rhodopsin:V8 protease) at room temperature for 1 h to remove the unique C-terminal proline-rich extension of the squid rhodopsin. The reaction was terminated by extensive washing with HEPES buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The membranes were solubilized with 2% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside (DDM, Anatrace) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.05% (w/v) DDM). The unbound fraction was collected and applied to a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The rhodopsin was eluted with 0.2 m α-methyl mannoside solution. Fractions containing squid rhodopsin were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A and then concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore). N-terminal Sequencing and Mass Analyses—The identity and integrity of the purified protein were assessed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation and various mass spectrometric analyses, including MALDI-TOF/MS, MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS, nano-liquid chromatographyquadrapole TOF-MS/MS, and high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-iontrap-MS/MS as described in the supplemental materials (14Nakamura T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2558-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. One microliter of protein sample (10 mg/ml) in a solution of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dodecyldimethylamine oxide, 0.03% (w/v) DDM was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 8% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400) and left to equilibrate at 20 °C. Crystals appeared after 5 days and stopped growing within 2 weeks. Structure Determination and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beam line BL45XU at SPring-8. Data were reduced using the program HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP in the CCP4 program suite (16Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using a monomer of the trigonal crystal structure of the bovine rhodopsin (PDB code: 1GZM) (17Li J. Edwards P.C. Burghammer M. Villa C. Schertler G.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 343: 1409-1438Crossref Scopus (676) Google Scholar) as a search model. Refinement and model building were performed iteratively with the programs CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). During refinement, we used grouped, unrestrained B-factor refinement with a single group for the entire molecule. All refinements were carried out with 10% of the reflections for cross validation. Despite the low resolution data and the low sequence homology between squid and bovine rhodopsins (24%), the structure was well refined thanks to the structural similarity of the transmembrane helices and the positions for a disulfide bridge, an 11-cis-retinal chromophore in the Schiff base linkage, and the conserved residues. B-factor sharpening was used to generate detailed maps using the CNS program with Bsharp values ranging from –50 to –150 Å2 (20Brünger A.T. Nature Protocols. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1.

Open table in a new tab Chemical Structure of Squid Rhodopsin—We first confirmed the chemical structure of V8 protease-treated squid rhodopsin. N-terminal sequencing and various MS analyses showed that the squid rhodopsin was cleaved at Glu-373 by the V8 protease, and the polypeptide chain was from Gly-2 to Glu-373 containing a Val to Ile substitution at position 18 with all the expected post-translational modifications. These included N-glycosylation and two palmitoylations, as well as a Schiff-based retinal. The molecular mass of squid rhodopsin was 43,842 Da (calculated molecular mass 43,883) by MALDI-TOF MS analysis (supplemental Fig. 1) (14Nakamura T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2558-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Hara-Nishimura I. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara R. Hara T.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Overall Structure—The overall structure of C-terminal truncated squid rhodopsin is a class A GPCR, with seven transmembrane helices, including the amphipathic short helix H8 and a prominent, well ordered cytoplasmic region (see Fig. 2A). All amino acid residues except the first 2 residues were defined in the structure, with a disulfide bridge between Cys-108 and Cys-186 in the extracellular region, the 11-cis-retinal connected to Lys-305 by the Schiff base, and the two palmitoyl thioesters of Cys-336 and Cys-337. We did not model the N-glycan of Asn-8 in the structure due to vague maps, although there were substantial electron densities in 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps where the glycan would be located (supplemental Fig. 2) (22Takahashi N. Masuda K. Hiraki K. Yoshihara K. Huang H.H. Khoo K.H. Kato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Squid rhodopsin has seven transmembrane helices (TH1–TH7) connected by three extracellular (EL1–EL3) and three cytoplasmic (CL1–CL3) loops with N- and C-terminal tails on the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides of the membrane (Fig. 2A). The transmembrane helices bend around the conserved proline or glycine residues, especially those with adjacent bulky aromatic residues (Fig. 1) (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori. T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar, 8Cherezov V. Rosenbaum D.M.

The amphipathic H8 is located just after TH7 at the putative cytoplasmic surface of the membrane and is a conserved structure in rhodopsin-like GPCRs (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori. T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar, 8Cherezov V. Rosenbaum D.M.

Yokomizo T. Hori T. Miyano M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32049-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The transmembrane helices of squid rhodopsin can be superimposed on those of bovine rhodopsin and human β2AR with the root mean square deviations of 1.5 and 2.2 Å, respectively, indicating that the transmembrane helical architecture of the three GPCRs are well conserved, despite many bends in the helices. The conformation of the N- and C-terminal tails and the CL2, CL3, and EL3 loops differs significantly between bovine and squid rhodopsins, whereas the EL2 conformation is similar to bovine rhodopsin to accommodate the same 11-cis-retinal ligand found in visual chromophores. In the proximal C-terminal tail, squid rhodopsin has a 5-residue insertion between H8 and the palmitoylated cysteines, whereas bovine rhodopsin and β2AR have a palmitoylated cysteine immediately after H8 (Fig. 1) (6Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 8Cherezov V. Rosenbaum D.M. Hanson M.A. Rasmussen S.G. Thian F.S.

In the large helix bundle cavity on the extracellular side, 11-cis-retinal bonds to Lys-305 with a putative protonated Schiff base, which is countered by the hydroxyl group of Tyr-111 as well as sandwiched by the amides of Asn-87 and Asn-185 at both sides of the retinal within hydrogen bond distances from the Schiff base nitrogen atom (21Hara-Nishimura I. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara R. Hara T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The architecture surrounding the Schiff base is consistent with a smaller blue shift upon photoactivation than that of bovine rhodopsin, whose Schiff base is directly countered by the charged Glu-113 (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori. T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Biol. 2004; 11: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The extended TH5 and TH6 and the cytoplasmic loops fold into the compact structure (Fig. 2), although squid rhodopsin has longer helices than bovine rhodopsin and β2AR on the cytoplasmic side (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori. T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Stevens R.C. Science. 2007; 318: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). Squid rhodopsin has a 12-amino-acid insertion in the CL3 region when compared with bovine rhodopsin (Fig. 1) (21Hara-Nishimura I. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara R. Hara T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TH5 elongates to Lys-239 with a bend at His-230 located at the putative cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, in addition to a small bend at Gly-208. TH6 extends from Glu-245 with a bend at Ser-275 before Pro-276 and Tyr-277 (Fig. 2A). In the distal C-terminal tail, the residues from Asp-341 to Asp-347 form an additional short hydrophilic C-terminal helix CH. After helix CH, the C-terminal tail from Lys-348 to Glu-373 (which is the C terminus in the V8-treated sample) interacts closely with the extended TH5/TH6 region. The C-terminal region returns to the putative membrane surface in an extended structure via polar interactions with CL2 (Fig. 2). Therefore, the truncated residual polyproline region may align along the surface of the plasma membrane to form the ordered rhabdomeric structure in squid photoreceptor cells (21Hara-Nishimura I. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara R. Hara T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interaction with G-protein—The cytoplasmic region is folded compactly in squid rhodopsin as described and is thought to interact with the coupling of Gq. The folded region consists of CL2, the helix bundle end of TH5 and TH6 extruded into the cytoplasm as the extended CL3 region, and H8 as well as the distal C-terminal tail including the CH helix. Except for the distal C-terminal tail, these regions interact directly with the respective G-protein in bovine rhodopsin, as shown by peptide competition studies (32König B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kalert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potentials of the cytoplasmic surfaces have a profile characteristic of intracellular GPCR domains (Fig. 2B). The distinct electrostatic profiles between these structures are located around the TH5 intracellular surface region of the putative plasma membrane. Interestingly, the corresponding TH5 region was important to Gi coupling but less so to Gq in BLT1 (28Kuniyeda K. Okuno T. Terawaki K. Miyano M. Yokomizo T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3998-4006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking studies of the active form of bovine rhodopsin showed that the CL3 center residues are located close to the Gt-coupled site (29Cai K. Itoh Y. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 30Itoh Y. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hori. T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar, 6Okada T.

In the trigonal bovine rhodopsin crystal, CL3 adopts an extended helix-like conformation similar to that of squid rhodopsin (Fig. 2B) (17Li J. Edwards P.C. Burghammer M. Villa C. Schertler G.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 343: 1409-1438Crossref Scopus (676) Google Scholar) but not in the tetragonal crystal due to hindrance in the crystal packing by contact with neighboring molecules (5Palczewski K.

The compact hydrophilic intracellular domain of squid rhodopsin on the plasma membrane should participate in recognizing the G-protein during activation. Like other class A GPCRs (26Delos Santos N.M.

https://openalex.org/W2000734457,"Background Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) provide a unique model to study early events in human development. The hESC-derived cells can potentially be used to replace or restore different tissues including neuronal that have been damaged by disease or injury. Methodology and Principal Findings The cells of two different hESC lines were converted to neural rosettes using adherent and chemically defined conditions. The progenitor cells were exposed to retinoic acid (RA) or to human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the late phase of the rosette formation. Exposing the progenitor cells to RA suppressed differentiation to rostral forebrain dopamine neural lineage and promoted that of spinal neural tissue including motor neurons. The functional characteristics of these differentiated neuronal precursors under both, rostral (bFGF) and caudalizing (RA) signals were confirmed by patch clamp analysis. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that our differentiation protocol has the capacity to generate region-specific and electrophysiologically active neurons under in vitro conditions without embryoid body formation, co-culture with stromal cells and without presence of cells of mesodermal or endodermal lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2008044940,"Regulating the choice between neural stem cell maintenance versus differentiation determines growth and size of the developing brain. Here we identify TGF-β signaling as a crucial factor controlling these processes. At early developmental stages, TGF-β signal activity is localized close to the ventricular surface of the neuroepithelium. In the midbrain, but not in the forebrain, Tgfbr2 ablation results in ectopic expression of Wnt1/β-catenin and FGF8, activation of Wnt target genes, and increased proliferation and horizontal expansion of neuroepithelial cells due to shortened cell-cycle length and decreased cell-cycle exit. Consistent with this phenotype, self-renewal of mutant neuroepithelial stem cells is enhanced in the presence of FGF and requires Wnt signaling. Moreover, TGF-β signal activation counteracts Wnt-induced proliferation of midbrain neuroepithelial cells. Thus, TGF-β signaling controls the size of a specific brain area, the dorsal midbrain, by antagonizing canonical Wnt signaling and negatively regulating self-renewal of neuroepithelial stem cells.

Thus, TGF-β signaling controls the size of a specific brain area, the dorsal midbrain, by antagonizing canonical Wnt signaling and negatively regulating self-renewal of neuroepithelial stem cells. The central nervous system (CNS) develops from self-renewing, multipotent neural stem cells that give rise to neural progenitor cells and eventually to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Neural stem cells can undergo symmetric, nonneurogenic divisions that produce two neuroepithelial stem cells and cause horizontal expansion of the proliferative population (Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Alternatively, they engage in asymmetric divisions that are associated with the generation of neuronal progenitors. Moreover, symmetric neurogenic divisions on the basal side of the neuroepithelium can contribute to rapid expansion of neuronal cells (Haubensak et al., 2004Haubensak W. Attardo A. Denk W. Huttner W.B. Neurons arise in the basal neuroepithelium of the early mammalian telencephalon: a major site of neurogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cortical neurons arise in symmetric and asymmetric division zones and migrate through specific phases.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Thus, the number of neural stem cells and their progeny critically depends on when the cells switch from symmetric to asymmetric divisions and on whether or not they exit the cell cycle (Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of neural stem and progenitor-cell proliferation (Unsicker and Krieglstein, 2006Unsicker K. Krieglstein K. Cell Signaling and Growth Factors in Development: From Molecules to Organogenesis. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2006Google Scholar). Manipulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway leads to dramatic changes in neural stem and progenitor populations (Kleber and Sommer, 2004Kleber M. Sommer L. Wnt signaling and the regulation of stem cell function.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In particular, overexpression of Wnts or persistent activation of the downstream signaling component β-catenin in the CNS promotes cell-cycle progression and negatively regulates cell-cycle exit, resulting in horizontal expansion of precursor populations (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A.

McMahon A.P. A mitogen gradient of dorsal midline Wnts organizes growth in the CNS.Development. 2002; 129: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in vivo overexpression of Wnt1 in the midbrain of transgenic mice leads to increased cell proliferation only in the dorsal, but not in the ventral, midbrain (Panhuysen et al., 2004Panhuysen M. Vogt Weisenhorn D.M. Blanquet V. Brodski C. Heinzmann U. Beisker W. Wurst W. Effects of Wnt1 signaling on proliferation in the developing mid-/hindbrain region.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), while in cultures of dissociated ventral midbrain cells Wnt1 is able to enhance proliferation concomitant with downregulation of cell-cycle inhibitor molecules such as p27 (Castelo-Branco et al., 2003Castelo-Branco G. Wagner J. Rodriguez F.J. Kele J. Sousa K. Rawal N. Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Kitajewski J. Arenas E. Differential regulation of midbrain dopaminergic neuron development by Wnt-1, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-5a.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling pathways regulating neural stem and progenitor-cell proliferation might be brain area-specific and influenced by the cellular context. While Wnt and other known signaling factors positively control expansion of neural stem and progenitor pools, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) upregulates cell-cycle inhibitors and counteracts cell-cycle progression in neuroepithelial cells in a context-dependent manner, at least in cultures of dissociated cells or in cortical slice cultures (Seoane et al., 2004Seoane J.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8627-8636Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). TGF-β, which signals through activation of TGF-β receptor type I and II (Tgfbr1 and Tgfbr2) and phosphorylation of the signaling mediators Smad2 and Smad3, elicits multiple cellular responses, including a cytostatic effect on various cell types (Siegel and Massague, 2003Siegel P.M.

Although TGF-β has been associated with neuronal differentiation and survival in the CNS (Brionne et al., 2003Brionne T.C. Tesseur I. Masliah E. Wyss-Coray T.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the function of TGF-β signaling in neural stem and progenitor cells in vivo remains to be determined. Here we show that TGF-β signaling in cells at the apical neuroepithelium represses FGF8 and Wnt1 expression as well as canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and, in the presence of FGF, controls self-renewal of neural stem cells in a region-specific manner. To investigate the role of TGF-β in neuroepithelial cells, we first addressed the expression of TGF-β signaling components in the developing brain. At E12.5, the ligands TGF-β1, -2, and -3 were not detectable in the neuroepithelium. However, the choroid plexus displayed strong TGF-β1 expression (Figure 1A). The receptor Tgfbr2 was broadly expressed throughout the neuroepithelium at E12.5, including in all phosphorylated histone H3 (pHH3)-positive M phase cells (Figures 1B and 1C). Consistent with the hypothesis that TGF-β1 is released from the choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid, phosphorylated (p)Smad2/3 were predominantly found in cells lining the apical side of the developing neuroepithelium (Figure 1D). In contrast, at E12.5, pSmad1/5/8 were not expressed in most of the neuroepithelium but the roof plate (data not shown; Ille et al., 2007Ille F. Atanasoski S. Falk S. Ittner L.M. Marki D. Buchmann-Moller S. Wurdak H. Suter U. Taketo M.M. Sommer L. Wnt/BMP signal integration regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of neuroepithelial cells in the dorsal spinal cord.Dev. Biol. 2007; 304: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The pSmad2/3 localization in cells close to the ventricle corresponds to the site where neuroepithelial stem cells undergo mitosis and presumably choose between symmetrical nonneurogenic and asymmetrical neurogenic cell division (Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Indeed, in both the developing fore- and midbrain at E12.5, the vast majority of these pSmad2/3-positive cells were in M phase, as revealed by coexpression of pHH3 (Figure 1D). To address the role of TGF-β signaling in the developing forebrain in vivo, we used the Cre/loxP system to conditionally ablate exon4 of the Tgfbr2 gene (Leveen et al., 2002Leveen P. Larsson J. Ehinger M. Cilio C.M. Sundler M. Sjostrand L.J. Holmdahl R. Karlsson S. Induced disruption of the transforming growth factor beta type II receptor gene in mice causes a lethal inflammatory disorder that is transplantable.Blood. 2002; 100: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Emx1-Cre-mediated recombination resulted in loss of Tgfbr2 protein in the forebrain neuroepithelium at E12.5 (Figure 2A), consistent with the previously reported activity of Emx1-Cre in the developing cortex from around E9.5 onward, before the onset of neurogenesis (Cappello et al., 2006Cappello S. Attardo A. Wu X. Iwasato T. Itohara S. Wilsch-Brauninger M. Eilken H.M. Rieger M.A. Schroeder T.T. Huttner W.B. et al.The Rho-GTPase cdc42 regulates neural progenitor fate at the apical surface.Nat.

Cortex-restricted disruption of NMDAR1 impairs neuronal patterns in the barrel cortex.Nature. 2000; 406: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, expression of pSmad2/3 in cells lining the ventricle was not affected in the forebrain neuroepithelium, pointing to compensatory signaling mechanisms (Figure 2B). Accordingly, we did not observe any overt cortical phenotype in the mutant (Figure 2C). Notably, the size of the proliferative neuroepithelium was not changed at E18, as visualized by immunohistochemical stainings for the proliferation marker Ki67 and pHH3 as well as for Sox2, a transcription factor associated with maintenance of neural progenitor features (Graham et al., 2003Graham V. Khudyakov J. Ellis P. Pevny L. SOX2 functions to maintain neural progenitor identity.Neuron. 2003; 39: 749-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) (Figures 2D and 2E). Likewise, overt differentiation as assayed by expression of the neuronal marker doublecortin (Dcx) was not altered in the absence of Tgfbr2 in the developing forebrain (Figure 2E). To elucidate the role of TGF-β signaling during mid-/hindbrain development in vivo, we carried out a Wnt1-Cre-mediated deletion of Tgfbr2 (Ittner et al., 2005Ittner L.M. Wurdak H. Schwerdtfeger K. Kunz T. Ille F. Leveen P. Hjalt T.A. Suter U. Karlsson S. Hafezi F. et al.Compound developmental eye disorders upon TGFβ signal inactivation in neural crest stem cells.J.

Inactivation of TGFbeta signaling in neural crest stem cells leads to multiple defects reminiscent of DiGeorge syndrome.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Ablation of Tgfbr2 in the mid-/hindbrain resulted in undetectable levels of Tgfbr2 protein. Unlike in the forebrain, a strong reduction of pSmad2/3 in neuroepithelial cells was observed at E12.5, indicating loss of TGF-β signal transduction to downstream signaling components (Figures 3A and 3B). In Wnt1-Cre/Tgfbr2 mutants, a specific expansion of the mutant isthmal and inferior tectal neuroepithelium was first detectable at E13.5 and prominent at E15, while the anterior dorsal and the ventral midbrain appeared unaffected (Figure 3C). The expansion in the mutant increased with embryonic age, fully covering the cerebellum at E17 (Figures 3F and 3G). In contrast, the morphology of the mutant cerebellum appeared normal throughout embryonic development. At E17, severe deficiencies in craniofacial structures became apparent, which were due to ablation of Tgfbr2 in the neural crest (Figure 3G, arrowhead) (Ittner et al., 2005Ittner L.M. Wurdak H. Schwerdtfeger K. Kunz T. Ille F. Leveen P. Hjalt T.A. Suter U. Karlsson S. Hafezi F. et al.Compound developmental eye disorders upon TGFβ signal inactivation in neural crest stem cells.J.

Inactivation of TGFbeta signaling in neural crest stem cells leads to multiple defects reminiscent of DiGeorge syndrome.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mutant embryos died before birth, most probably due to anomalies in cardiac neural crest derivatives (Wurdak et al., 2005Wurdak H. Ittner L.M. Lang K.S. Leveen P. Suter U. Fischer J.A. Karlsson S. Born W. Sommer L. Inactivation of TGFbeta signaling in neural crest stem cells leads to multiple defects reminiscent of DiGeorge syndrome.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The isthmus organizer located at the mid-/hindbrain boundary controls early development and identity of adjacent mid- and hindbrain areas. At E10.5, the TGF-β pathway, although reduced, was still active in a considerable number of cells (relative number of pSmad2/3-positive cells in control, 100% ± 13.5%; mutant, 44.2% ± 4.2%). Therefore, the alterations in the Tgfbr2 mutant midbrain unlikely originate from disturbed patterning. Indeed, no aberrant morphology was observed in the mutant at E10.5, and at E12.5 we found no change in the expression of the transcription factors otx2 and Pax2 that mark specific domains in the developing mid-/hindbrain (Broccoli et al., 1999Broccoli V. Boncinelli E. Wurst W. The caudal limit of Otx2 expression positions the isthmic organizer.Nature. 1999; 401: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, Rowitch and McMahon, 1995Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Pax-2 expression in the murine neural plate precedes and encompasses the expression domains of Wnt-1 and En-1.Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (see Figure S1 available with this article online). Furthermore, the mutant phenotype did not result from structural disintegration, as both the histological appearance and the cell density were not changed in the mutant midbrain neuroepithelium (Figure 3C; data not shown). Analysis of Ki67 and Sox2 expression at E15 revealed that the affected area in the Wnt1-Cre/Tgfbr2 mutant midbrain was largely composed of proliferative neural progenitors (Figures 3D and 3E). Dcx-expressing neuronal cells were present at the basal side of the mutant neuroepithelium, indicating that differentiation per se was not affected. The neuroepithelial expansion and in particular the increase in absolute numbers of proliferative cells might be due to decreased apoptosis or increased relative proliferation rates at earlier developmental stages. However, no decrease in the number of apoptotic cells was apparent in the mutant at E13, E15, and E17 (data not shown). To test whether absence of TGF-β signaling affects neuroepithelial cell proliferation at early developmental stages, we analyzed the expression of Ki67 and pHH3. Although at E12.5 the area of proliferative neuroepithelial cells was of comparable size in control and mutant midbrain, quantification of proliferative cells by FACS revealed that the relative number of Ki67-positive cells was slightly but significantly enhanced in the mutant (Figure 4A). In addition, quantification of cells expressing Dcx revealed reduced numbers of differentiating neurons (Figure 4B). Thus, absence of TGF-β signaling affects the number of proliferative progenitors. Different cellular processes could lead to an increased pool of proliferative cells in the mutant, which over time would produce the expansion observed in the mutant midbrain neuroepithelium. For instance, Tgfbr2-deficient cells might undergo a shortened cell cycle, resulting in more cycling cells at a given time point. To estimate the cycling time of proliferating cells, we performed cell-cycle FACS analysis in combination with Ki67 staining of dissociated cells from control and mutant dorsal midbrains (Figure 4C). S phase stays relatively constant in mammalian cells, while the length of G1 regulates cell-cycle time (Calegari and Huttner, 2003Calegari F. Huttner W.B. An inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases that lengthens, but does not arrest, neuroepithelial cell cycle induces premature neurogenesis.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4947-4955Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 1995Takahashi T. Nowakowski R.S. Caviness Jr., V.S. The cell cycle of the pseudostratified ventricular epithelium of the embryonic murine cerebral wall.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6046-6057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the relative fraction of proliferating cells that are in S phase at a specific time point is higher in cell populations with shorter cell-cycle time. At E10.5, proliferation and the fraction of cells in S phase was similar in mutant and control embryos (data not shown). However, in the dorsal midbrain at E12.5, the relative fraction of proliferative cells in S phase was significantly increased in the mutant as compared to the control (Figure 4C). To further confirm changes in cell-cycle length in mutant cells, we assessed the cell-cycle time (TC) by cumulative BrdU labeling experiments at E12.5 (Nowakowski et al., 1989Nowakowski R.S. Lewin S.B. Miller M.W. Bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemical determination of the lengths of the cell cycle and the DNA-synthetic phase for an anatomically defined population.J. Neurocytol. 1989; 18: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The cell-cycle time of mutant neuroepithelial cells was drastically reduced (Figure 4C, right panel). Thus, Tgfbr2-mutant neuroepithelial cells divide with a shorter cell-cycle time than do control cells. The increase of proliferative cells in the mutant midbrain could also be caused by mutant neuroepithelial cells preferentially choosing to stay in rather than to exit the cell cycle. To address this possibility, the fraction of cells dividing after BrdU pulse labeling 20 hr earlier was determined. Cells that had left the cell cycle were identified as BrdU positive and Ki67 negative, while cells that remained in the cell cycle were BrdU positive and Ki67 positive. At E12.5, a highly significant decrease of cells exiting the cell cycle was detectable in the mutant as compared to the control (Figure 4D), indicating that TGF-β signal inactivation in dorsal midbrain not only affects cell-cycle length of dividing neural progenitors but also the choice whether or not to exit the cell cycle. In mutants, as in controls, the vast majority of the cells that left the cell cycle adopted a neuronal fate (Figure 4E). Canonical Wnt signaling via the intracellular signaling component β-catenin regulates cell-cycle exit and expansion of progenitor cells in the developing cortex and other brain areas (Kleber and Sommer, 2004Kleber M. Sommer L. Wnt signaling and the regulation of stem cell function.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To test whether midbrain neuroepithelial expansion in the absence of TGF-β signaling is linked to Wnt signaling, we first examined the expression of wnt1 mRNA in control and mutant dorsal midbrains by in situ hybridization at E12.5. Before overt morphological changes, wnt1 was ectopically expressed (Figure 5B) in the domain displaying decreased cell-cycle exit (Figure 4D). Canonical Wnt signaling leads to stabilization of β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus (Reya and Clevers, 2005Reya T. Clevers H. Wnt signalling in stem cells and cancer.Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar). Immunostaining combined with confocal microscopy demonstrated nuclear accumulation of β-catenin specifically in cells populating the region of ectopic wnt1 in E12.5 mutant embryos (Figure 5C). Corresponding control cells lacked nuclear β-catenin and exhibited only the form of the protein associated with cell-cell adhesion complexes. Furthermore, western blot analysis confirmed the presence of activated β-catenin in mutant dorsal midbrains, while it was undetectable in controls (Figure 5D). In culture of neural progenitor cells, the effect of canonical Wnt signaling on proliferation is dependent on the presence of FGF (Israsena et al., 2004Israsena N. Hu M. Fu W. Kan L. Kessler J.A. The presence of FGF2 signaling determines whether beta-catenin exerts effects on proliferation or neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells.Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Consistent with Wnt/β-catenin acting in concert with FGF signaling, fgf8 mRNA was ectopically expressed in the Tgfbr2-deficient dorsal midbrain in the domain of ectopic wnt1 expression (Figure 5A). Thus, TGF-β signal inactivation in the mid-/hindbrain region results in increased wnt1 and fgf8 expression concomitant with nuclear accumulation of activated β-catenin in the dorsal midbrain. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms possibly underlying altered cell-cycle progression in Tgfbr2 mutant midbrain neuroepithelial cells, we performed real-time PCR with a particular focus on cell-cycle regulators. The cell-cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 are known targets of TGF-β signal activity (Seoane et al., 2004Seoane J. Le H.V. Shen L. Anderson S.A. Massague J. Integration of Smad and forkhead pathways in the control of neuroepithelial and glioblastoma cell proliferation.Cell. 2004; 117: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, Siegenthaler and Miller, 2005Siegenthaler J.A. Miller M.W. Transforming growth factor beta1 promotes cell cycle exit through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in the developing cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8627-8636Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, in the Tgfbr2 mutant midbrain, neither the expression of p21 nor of p27 was changed (data not shown). Likewise, expression of the negative cell-cycle regulators PTEN, p19, and p53 was unaltered in the Tgfbr2 mutant midbrain as compared to the control. In contrast, expression of specific positive cell-cycle regulators was upregulated in the mutant (Figures 5E and 5F). In particular, the expression of CyclinD2 and CyclinD1 was significantly increased. CyclinE expression, however, was unaltered. Of the cyclin interaction partners, Cdk4 and a Cdk2 isoform displayed significantly enhanced expression in the mutant. These data point to selective activation of cell-cycle-promoting factors upon inactivation of TGF-β signaling. Moreover, the transcriptional activation of known Wnt targets such as CyclinD1 supports the hypothesis that increased proliferation in neuroepithelial cells lacking Tgfbr2 is mediated by derepressed Wnt signaling. The horizontal expansion and shortening of the cell-cycle length in Tgfbr2-deficient dorsal midbrain conceivably reflects an influence of TGF-β on symmetric stem cell self-renewal, rather than on proliferation of progenitors or cell-lineage decision. To address on the cellular level how loss of TGF-β signaling might influence neural stem and progenitor cells, we cultured neurospheres (Reynolds and Rietze, 2005Reynolds B.A. Rietze R.L. Neural stem cells and neurospheres—re-evaluating the relationship.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) derived from dissociated dorsal midbrains of E12.5 and E15 embryos. Recombination efficiency within neurospheres was assessed by X-Gal staining taking advantage of the Rose26 Cre reporter allele (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar), revealing efficient recombination in virtually all control and mutant spheres (Figure 6A). In agreement with enhanced nuclear β-catenin expression observed in the mutant midbrain in vivo (Figures 5C and 5D), activated β-catenin levels were augmented in Tgfbr2 mutant neurospheres derived from E12.5 and from E15 midbrains (Figure 6B, Figure S2B). Intriguingly, increased formation of mutant spheres occurred only in the presence of FGF, but not in medium containing EGF without FGF (Figure 6C, Figure S2C). Thus, TGF-β signal inactivation leads to canonical Wnt signal activation in neural stem/progenitor cells and to increased sphere formation specifically in the presence of FGF. In order to compare the self-renewal capacity of Tgfbr2 mutant and control stem/progenitor cells, primary spheres were propagated at clonal density. The number of secondary spheres per primary sphere as well as the number of spheres obtained upon serial propagation was significantly increased in mutant cultures, suggesting a higher number of self-renewing neural stem/progenitor cells present in mutant dorsal midbrains at E12.5 as well as at E15 (Figures 6D and 6E; Figure S2D). Strikingly, mutant sphere formation steadily increased with each successive passage, while the number of control spheres remained relatively constant at significantly lower levels over six passages and decreased toward zero in the seventh passage. These data indicate not only a greater number of neural stem cells in primary mutant tissue but also enhanced self-renewal of mutant neural stem cells over time. Besides their ability to self renew, the key characteristic of neural stem cells is tripotency (Reynolds and Rietze, 2005Reynolds B.A. Rietze R.L. Neural stem cells and neurospheres—re-evaluating the relationship.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Upon differentiation, about 70% of control and mutant spheres were tripotent, giving rise to neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, and no significant difference in the overall differentiation potential of control and mutant spheres was observed (Figure 6F). Furthermore, cell-lineage specification within individual differentiating spheres was not changed, since similar percentages of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes were found in mutant and control secondary spheres (Figure 6G). We next addressed whether loss of TGF-β signaling not only affects the self-renewal of stem cells but also the proliferation of stem cell-derived transient amplifying progenitor cells. Since increased proliferation of the latter correlates with sphere size, we compared the diameters of control versus mutant neurosphere populations. Interestingly, the average diameter of mutant primary and secondary spheres derived from either E12.5 or E15 dorsal midbrains was not altered as compared to control spheres (Figures S2E–S2G). Additionally, control and mutant spheres consisted of a similar number of cells throughout several passages (Figure S2H), indicating that in culture proliferation of transient amplifying progenitor cells is not affected by the absence of TGF-β signaling. Since loss of TGF-β signaling significantly enhanced self-renewal of mutant neural stem cells in the presence of FGF, increased TGF-β may elicit the opposite effect.

However, the molecular pathogenesis of this new emerging pathogen is still poorly understood.89K is a newly predicted pathogenicity island (PAI) which is specific to Chinese epidemic strains isolated from these two SS2 outbreaks. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed a unique two-component signal transduction system (TCSTS) located in the candidate 89K PAI, which is orthologous to the SalK/SalR regulatory system of Streptococcus salivarius. Knockout of salKR eliminated the lethality of SS2 in experimental infection of piglets. Functional complementation of salKR into the isogenic mutant DeltasalKR restored its soaring pathogenicity. Colonization experiments showed that the DeltasalKR mutant could not colonize any susceptible tissue of piglets when administered alone. Bactericidal assays demonstrated that resistance of the mutant to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-mediated killing was greatly decreased. Expression microarray analysis exhibited a transcription profile alteration of 26 various genes down-regulated in the DeltasalKR mutant.These findings suggest that SalK/SalR is requisite for the full virulence of ethnic Chinese isolates of highly pathogenic SS2, thus providing experimental evidence for the validity of this bioinformatically predicted PAI."
https://openalex.org/W2112791146,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising new HIV prevention method, especially for women. An urgent demand for implementation of PrEP is expected at the moment efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical trials. We explored the long-term impact of PrEP on HIV transmission in different HIV epidemics.We used a mathematical model that distinguishes the general population, sex workers and their clients. PrEP scenarios varying in effectiveness, coverage and target group were modeled in the epidemiological settings of Botswana, Nyanza Province in Kenya, and Southern India. We also studied the effect of condom addition or condom substitution during PrEP use. Main outcome was number of HIV infections averted over ten years of PrEP use. PrEP strategies with high effectiveness and high coverage can have a substantial impact in African settings. In Southern India, by contrast, the number of averted HIV infections in different PrEP scenarios would be much lower. The impact of PrEP may be strongly diminished or even reversed by behavioral disinhibition, especially in scenarios with low coverage and low effectiveness. However, additional condom use during low coverage and low effective PrEP doubled the amount of averted HIV infections.The public health impact of PrEP can be substantial. However, this impact may be diminished, or even reversed, by changes in risk behavior. Implementation of PrEP strategies should therefore come on top of current condom campaigns, not as a substitution."

In this study, we focus on the role of Notch signaling in governing cell-fate choices in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).

We report here that activation of Notch signaling is required for undifferentiated hESCs to form the progeny of all three embryonic germ layers, but not trophoblast cells. In addition, transient Notch signaling pathway activation enhanced generation of hematopoietic cells from committed hESCs.

Human ESCs can divide indefinitely in culture while retaining their pluripotency to form all the cell types derived from ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm, and trophectoderm (Reubinoff et al., 2000Reubinoff B.E.

A major challenge for the future clinical use of hESCs is to efficiently direct ESC differentiation toward specific cell lineages. In addition, it is essential after a directed differentiation procedure to separate committed progenitor cells from residual pluripotent undifferentiated hESCs that may form tumors (teratomas) after transplantation. The extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms governing cell-fate choices of hESCs remain obscure. Our current knowledge of hESC-fate determination is largely extrapolated from the studies of mouse embryogenesis and murine ESCs (mESCs). Although human and mouse ESCs share similar fundamental properties such as pluripotency and unique transcriptional networking, they differ significantly in several ways (Ginis et al., 2004Ginis I. Luo Y. Miura T. Thies S. Brandenberger R. Gerecht-Nir S. Amit M. Hoke A. Carpenter M.K. Itskovitz-Eldor J. et al.Differences between human and mouse embryonic stem cells.Dev.

For example, LIF/STAT3 signaling that is critical for mESC self-renewal is instead dispensable for propagation of undifferentiated hESCs (Daheron et al., 2004Daheron L. Opitz S.L. Zaehres H. Lensch W.M. Andrews P.W. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Daley G.Q.

Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The roles of other signaling pathways in hESCs remain to be fully determined. The evolutionally conserved Notch signaling pathway plays diverse roles in cell-fate specification in embryogenesis and adult tissues (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Notch signaling: Cell fate control and signal integration in development.Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4670) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there are four Notch receptors (Notch1–Notch4) and numerous transmembrane ligands such as Delta-like (i.e., DLL1 and DLL4) and Jagged (i.e., JAG1 and JAG2). Although Notch signaling in organogenesis and murine tissue-specific adult stem cells has been well studied, its precise roles for ESCs are less understood. The Notch signaling network appears active in undifferentiated mESCs (Lowell et al., 2006Lowell S. Benchoua A. Heavey B. Smith A.G. Notch promotes neural lineage entry by pluripotent embryonic stem cells.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e121https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040121Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). After withdrawal of self-renewal factors such as LIF and BMP4 for mESCs in culture, active Notch signaling directed mESC differentiation toward a neuroectodermal fate (Lowell et al., 2006Lowell S. Benchoua A. Heavey B. Smith A.G.

Multiple Notch receptor and ligand mRNAs are detected in multiple undifferentiated hESCs, such as H1 (Brandenberger et al., 2004Brandenberger R. Khrebtukova I. Thies R.S. Miura T. Jingli C. Puri R.

However, the exact role of Notch signaling in hESCs remains elusive and controversial. Ligand binding to a Notch receptor results in its cleavage by a membrane-associated protease complex (γ-secretase) containing presenilin (Ehebauer et al., 2006Ehebauer M. Hayward P. Martinez-Arias A. Notch signaling pathway.Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: cm7Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Ilagan and Kopan, 2007Ilagan M.X. Kopan R. SnapShot: Notch signaling pathway.Cell. 2007; 128: 1246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The released intracellular domain of the Notch receptor (ICN) is then translocated to the nucleus, where it complexes with the DNA-binding protein CBF1 (CSL, RBPJκ, or RBPSUH), the transactivator Mastermind-like (MAML), and other modulators. The complex then binds to the cognate DNA sequence of CBF1 and regulates the transcription of multiple effector genes, including members of HES/HEY family such as HES1. Notch proteolytic cleavage and signaling can be inhibited by γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), although they are not specific in blocking Notch activation. Use of a dominant-negative form of MAML1 (DNMAML) provides a second means to block Notch/CBF1-mediated signaling. A DNMAML-GFP fusion protein has been shown to efficiently inhibit CBF1-mediated transcriptional activation by all four Notch receptors in vitro (Weng et al., 2003Weng A.P. Nam Y. Wolfe M.S. Pear W.S. Griffin J.D. Blacklow S.C. Aster J.C. Growth suppression of pre-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells by inhibition of notch signaling.Mol. Cell.

Med. 2005; 202: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and is also used in this study. Using genetic approaches and a newer GSI with reduced toxicity, we report here that we have achieved both blockade and conditional activation of Notch signaling in two hESCs. We confirmed that the Notch/CBF1 pathway is not required or activated in undifferentiated hESCs. However, Notch signaling activation is required for hESCs to generate derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers, but not the trophoblastic lineage. Based on these novel observations, we propose a new model for the role of Notch signaling in governing hESC-fate choices. Consistent with previously published data, we observed that many Notch pathway genes are expressed in hESCs (Table S1 and Figure S1 available online). To directly measure endogenous Notch/CBF1-mediated activity in hESCs, we used a luciferase (Luc) reporter system in which Luc transcription is controlled by the canonical CBF1 responsive element (WT-CBFRE). A related reporter with mutated CBFRE (mutCBFRE) was used as a negative control to determine the basal level of transcription in the same cell types studied. The CBF1 activity in differentiated cells (obtained after teratoma formation) was ∼70-fold higher than in undifferentiated cells (Figure 1A). CBF1-mediated activity in undifferentiated and differentiated hESCs was next measured in the presence of GSI-18 that is less toxic than the widely used DAPT (Figure S3). GSI-18 substantially reduced the CBF1-mediated activity of differentiated hESCs, while it had little effect on mutCBFRE reporter activity. Moreover, we analyzed the endogenous expression of major Notch effector genes including four members of the HES/HEY family (Figure 1B and Figure S1). As compared to differentiated cells in teratomas (100%), the expression level of all 4 target genes was lower in undifferentiated hESCs (Figure 1B). The expression of the DNMAML inhibitory transgene further reduced the expression of HEY1 and HEY2, similar to the findings with the CBF1 reporter assay. Therefore, the Notch signaling pathway is inactive or negligibly low in undifferentiated hESCs. To further evaluate the functional status of Notch signaling pathway in undifferentiated hESCs, we tested if the exogenous full-length Notch1 (N1FL) cDNA expression could turn on the CBF1 reporter. There was no evidence of Notch cleavage or activation (CBF1 reporter activity) in hESCs after the transfection of the N1FL cDNA (Figure 1C). However, in the presence of exogenous Notch ligand DLL1, 6-fold increase of CBF1 activity was observed only in hESCs transfected with the N1FL cDNA. Interestingly, functional JAG1 treatment (Figure S2C) did not lead to active Notch1 cleavage. Our data confirm that Notch signaling pathway is inactive in undifferentiated hESCs, but can be activated if both exogenous Notch1 receptor and ligand (DLL1) are provided. Next we examined the kinetics of Notch signaling activation in differentiating hESCs (Figures 1D–1F). A standard method to differentiate ESCs is to form embryoid bodies (EBs) in the presence of serum. First, we transfected a CBFRE-GFP reporter plasmid (Duncan et al., 2005Duncan A.W. Rattis F.M. DiMascio L.N. Congdon K.L. Pazianos G. Zhao C. Yoon K. Cook J.M. Willert K. Gaiano N. et al.Integration of Notch and Wnt signaling in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance.Nat.

Differential Notch signalling distinguishes neural stem cells from intermediate progenitors.Nature. 2007; 449: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) into undifferentiated hESCs, which were subsequently induced to differentiate by EB formation. Positive GFP expression started to appear one day after EB formation and further intensified during the culture (Figure 1D). In contrast, no GFP expression was found if the transfected hESCs were cultured in self-renewal maintaining medium. By western blot, we observed the cleaved Notch1 protein (cN1) peaked on day 2 and diminished on day 3 after EB formation (Figure 1E). In addition, DLL1 protein expression was also elevated 48 hr after differentiation (Figure 1F). These data provide strong evidence that Notch signaling is activated in the initial stage of hESC differentiation. Notch activation at the single-cell level 48 hr after EB formation was also examined by using the anti-cN1 antibody (Figures 1G and 1H). We observed that cN1+ cells were largely lacking Oct4 expression (Figure 1G), whereas many coexpress a lineage-commitment marker Nestin (Figure 1H). The data indicate that Notch activation in hESCs is associated with exiting from the undifferentiated state and differentiation commencement. We next examined directly the effects of Notch signaling blockade on the growth of undifferentiated hESCs (Figures 1I and 1J). As compared to the GFP control, GSI-18-treated or DNMAML-transduced H9 hESCs generated greater numbers of total cells after 5 days of culture and a higher frequency of colony-forming (self-renewing) undifferentiated hESCs, resulting in a total of 2.5-fold more undifferentiated colonies (Figure 1I). Similar results were obtained with the H1 hESC line expressing DNMAML, although the GFP-transduced or parental H1 hES controls also grew quite robust. We further characterized these DNMAML+ cells by examining the expression of undifferentiated ES markers Oct4 and Tra-1-60 (Figure 1J). The percentage of Oct4+Tra-1-60+ cells with DNMAML transduction was comparable to the control hESCs. Moreover, both DNMAML+ H1 and H9 hESCs can be cultured for 30–40 passages and remain phenotypically normal (data not shown). Therefore, the observed low-level Notch/CBF1 activity in undifferentiated hESC populations appears inessential for their self-renewal and is likely derived from a minor fraction of spontaneously differentiating or differentiated progeny in the standard hESC culture. Conversely, we examined the consequence of induced Notch signaling activation in hESCs, either by exposure to the Notch ligand DLL1 or by enforced expression of ICN1 or HES1 transgene (Figure 2). First, hESCs were cocultured with 3T3-DLL1 or control 3T3 cells in undifferentiated hES culture medium (Figure 2A). hESCs cultured on 3T3-DLL1 cells for 4 days generated significantly fewer alkaline phosphatase positive (AP+) undifferentiated colonies (Figure 2A; Figure S4). We further confirmed this observation by culturing hESCs with purified DLL1 (Varnum-Finney et al., 2000Varnum-Finney B. Wu L. Yu M. Brashem-Stein C. Staats S. Flowers D. Griffin J.D. Bernstein I.D. Immobilization of Notch ligand, Delta-1, is required for induction of notch signaling.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified DLL1 as an IgG fusion protein (DLL1ext-IgG) or IgG control was immobilized in Matrigel, which provides a feeder-free substrate. Eight days after treatment, comparable numbers of cells were harvested (Figure S5A). About 13% of DLL1-treated hESCs (GFP+) lost Oct4 expression, whereas only 2% of cells were Oct4 negative in the control IgG group (Figure 2B). The number of undifferentiated hES colonies was reduced by >10-fold after the DLL1 treatment in a more stringent AP+ colony-forming assay (Figure 2C; Figure S4B). We also attempted to obtain stably transduced hESCs using lentiviral vectors coexpressing GFP and either ICN1 or HES1. Although transduced (GFP+) ESCs were observed initially, ICN1-transduced cells (data not shown) and HES1-transduced cells disappeared after a few passages (Figure S6). In contrast, 100% of transduced cells in the control (GFP or ID1) groups remained Oct4+ (Figure S6). To better assess the effects of ICN1 or HES1 overexpression in hESCs, we utilized lentiviral vectors expressing a form of ICN1 as an estrogen receptor (ER) fusion protein (ICN1-ER; Figures S2A and S2B) and HES1-ER (Yu et al., 2006Yu X. Alder J.K. Chun J.H. Friedman A.D. Heimfeld S. Cheng L. Civin C.I. HES1 inhibits cycling of hematopoietic progenitor cells via DNA-binding.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the absence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) induction, ICN1-ER- or HES1-ER-transduced hESCs had normal morphology and similar self-renewal ability comparable to the control GFP vector (Figures 2D–2G). Upon induction with 4HT, however, ICN1-ER+ ESCs lost 92% of their colony-forming ability after one passage (Figure 2D). The Oct4 expression was also diminished in the majority of the ICN1-ER+ cells (Figure 2E). Similarly, activation of HES1 by 4HT in hESs coexpressing HES1-ER and GFP transgenes led to a significant phenotypic change (Figure 2F). Eventually, the majority of cells lost their colony-forming ability after 10 days of 4HT induction (Figure 2G). We monitored closely the numbers of viable and apoptotic cells after Notch activation. Similar numbers of cells were observed in both IgG and DLL1ext-IgG treated hESCs (Figure S5A). The total number of viable cells or the percent viable cells (Annexin−/7AAD−) in the ICN1-ER+ hES group was similar to those of the control groups (Figures S5B and S5C). Thus, the reduction of undifferentiated hESCs after Notch activation primarily results from cell differentiation rather than decreased proliferation or increased apoptosis. Next, we examined the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation commitment of hESCs through EB formation. In the control hESC group (GFP+), the size of aggregates increased with time, and more structured (cystic) EBs were visible after 3 days (Figure 3A). However, hESCs in which Notch signaling was blocked by DNMAML formed cystic EBs poorly, despite the fact that they appeared normal in their undifferentiated hESC state. To exclude the possibility that the observed effects might be due to increased apoptosis in Notch inhibited cells, we examined the cells for signs of apoptosis before and after the switch of culture conditions. No differences were observed in DNMAML+ cells, as compared to controls (Figure 3B). To quantify the spectrum and degree of differentiation, EBs were collected at different stages and analyzed by RT-PCR for the expression of representative markers of various embryonic cell lineages. After 5 days, the levels of PAX6 (ectoderm marker), AFP (endoderm marker), and CD34 and SCL/TAL-1 (mesoderm markers) were sharply elevated in the control hESCs from undetectable at day 0 (data not shown) to levels comparable (or higher for AFP) to those of teratoma cells (Figure 3C). However, the expression of these markers was significantly lower in the DNMAML-transduced group, suggesting that differentiation into the progeny of all three embryonic germ layers is blocked. We also analyzed the expression of NANOG and OCT4 (undifferentiated ESC markers) in these cells. The DNMAML+ cells expressed more than 20-fold higher levels of NANOG or OCT4, as compared to that of the control group, further indicating that blocked Notch activity inhibited ESC differentiation. Similar results were found in both H9 and H1 cells treated with GSIs (Figures 3F and 4A). Inefficient EB formation observed with DNMAML+ hESCs may result from poor cell-cell contact, which in turn might affect differentiation within EBs. Thus, we used a method to generate EBs that forces cell-cell contact in 96-well microtiter plates (Ng et al., 2005Ng E.S. Davis R.P. Azzola L. Stanley E.G. Elefanty A.G. Forced aggregation of defined numbers of human embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies fosters robust, reproducible hematopoietic differentiation.Blood. 2005; 106: 1601-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to the control group, few of DNMAML+ EBs became cystic after 12 days of culture (Figure 3D). This reduced cystic EB formation was also seen in the wild-type hESCs after GSI (GSI-18 or GSI-2) treatment. In the presence of DMSO vehicle alone, 70% of EBs transduced with either control or HES1-ER lentivector was cystic (Figure 3E). However, continuous treatment with a GSI inhibited EB maturation (<10% of total EBs were cystic) in the control group. The inhibition of cystic EB formation by GSI was largely rescued by the HES1 gene expression: ∼50% of the HES1-ER+ EBs remained cystic at the end of a 12 day culture in the presence of 4HT induction. Next, we analyzed the expression of lineage markers of the three embryonic germ layers in the day 12 EBs formed in the presence or absence of GSI, from either control or the HES1-ER-transduced hESCs (Figure 3F). As expected, GSI-treated cells transduced with the control lentivector showed severely reduced expression of all the lineage markers used (AFP, PAX6, CD34, and TAL-1). In contrast, HES1-ER activation by 4HT resulted in the partial restoration of expression of the differentiation markers in GSI-treated cells, suggesting that the observed GSI effect in this system is Notch signaling specific. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Notch signaling is required for lineage commitment to form cell derivatives of the three embryonic germ layers. A pulse of Notch signaling observed within 48 hr of EB differentiation (Figures 1D–1F) may be essential for lineage commitment of hESCs. To test this hypothesis, GSI-18 (or DMSO vehicle) was added into the culture at either the beginning of EB formation or 2 days later. In contrast to the significant changes observed if GSI treatment started at day 0 (Figure 4A), starting GSI treatment at day 2 had little effects on EB maturation or gene expression patterns in EB-derived cells at day 6 (Figure 4B). The data confirmed that a pulse of Notch signaling within first 48 hr of EB formation is required for hESC to differentiate and commit to the three embryonic lineages. High levels of NANOG and OCT4 mRNA expression were detected after differentiation induction in hESCs with reduced Notch activity (Figures 3C and 4A), indicating that some ESCs remained undifferentiated within EBs. We stained day 6 EBs to detect the level of nuclear Oct4 protein (Figure 4C). Significant numbers of Oct4+ cells remained in the DNMAML group. In contrast, only a few scattered Oct4+ cells were observed in control ESC-derived EBs. Next, we assessed the content of remaining undifferentiated hESCs in the DNMAML group during a prolonged differentiation culture. Day 12 EBs were dissociated into single cells and plated on feeder cells in culture conditions designed to maintain undifferentiated hESCs. The number of AP+ colonies derived from the DNMAML+ group was 4-fold higher than that of the control EBCs (Figure 4D), indicating that reduced Notch activity prevented the undifferentiated hESCs from entering differentiation. To induce further in vitro differentiation, day 12 EBs were transferred onto mouse OP9 cells and cultured for an additional 7 days. Then, all cells were harvested for immunostaining for Tra-1-60 (an undifferentiated marker) and Tra-1-85, a marker unique for human cells (Figure 4E). After a two-step, 19 day differentiation, only 11%–13% of untransduced or parental GFP-transduced cells remained Tra-1-60+. In contrast, 54% of DNMAML+ cells still expressed Tra-1-60. Next, we examined whether Notch activation by HES1 overexpression enhanced hematopoietic differentiation after mesoderm commitment (Figure 5). HES1-ER+ EBs aggregated in the presence of 4HT for 12 days generated more hematopoietic colonies than control EBs (Figure 5A). When EB-derived cells were allowed to further differentiate on OP9 stromal cells for 7 days, 39% of the cells in the HES1-ER group were CD34+CD45+. In contrast, only 13% of the cells were CD34+CD45+ in the control (GFP only) group (Figures 5B and 5C). Notably, 4HT was added only during the first stage of differentiation (EB formation) to activate the HES1-ER transgene, but not in the two subsequent hematopoietic assays. If exposure to 4HT was continued during the hematopoietic assays, however, cell proliferation was reduced (data not shown). This is consistent with our previous observation that continued HES1 overexpression inhibited postnatal mouse and human hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation (Yu et al., 2006Yu X. Alder J.K.

Our results demonstrated that controlled activation of Notch signaling can be used to direct differentiation of hESCs to a specific lineage under appropriate culture conditions. In addition to cells derived from the three embryonic germ layers, hESCs can differentiate into trophoblasts by either EB formation (Gerami-Naini et al., 2004Gerami-Naini B. Dovzhenko O.V. Durning M.

Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. BMP4 initiates human embryonic stem cell differentiation to trophoblast.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of Notch signaling in trophoblastic differentiation, we first analyzed the expression of trophectoderm markers (i.e., CDX2, chorionic gonadotropin A and B [CGA, CGB]) within EBs (Figures 6A–6C). Levels of mRNA of these genes were significantly elevated in differentiating DNMAML+ EBCs (H1) compared to the control groups (Figures 6A–6C). Similar results were observed with H9 hESCs, when whole EBs were stained for trophoblastic markers such as TROMA-I (Figure 6D). More TROMA-I+ cells were observed in the peripheral zones of DNMAML+ EBs than that of control EBs (Figure 6D). We also measured by FACS what proportion of the cells in EBs (day 12) expressed trophoblastic markers. TROMA-I or β-hCG was expressed in 5% to 6% of DNMAML+ EBCs. In contrast, <1% of the control EBCs expressed trophoblastic markers (Figure 6E). The effect of Notch blockade on BMP4-induced trophoblastic differentiation was also examined in several transduced hESC lines (Figures 6F–6H). Cells were plated at the same density and induced by BMP4 for 10 days. Supernatants were then collected for measuring β-hCG hormone production by ELISA. Relative to cells transduced with the control lentivector, the HES1+ cells produced only 20% of the hCG protein (Figure 6G). In contrast, hESCs transduced with a HES1 DNA-binding mutant (ΔBHES1) showed normal hCG production. Reduction in hCG production was also observed in ICN1+ ESCs (Figure 6F). Blocking Notch activity using a GSI resulted in a 2-fold increase in hCG production in control cells, but not in ICN1+ cells. We also analyzed hCG levels in the DNMAML+ cells. The DNMAML+ cells produced ∼5-fold higher levels of hCG, as compared to the level measured in control groups (Figure 6H). Together, these results demonstrate that trophoblastic differentiation is inhibited by the activated Notch signaling. We next examined cell-fate choices of hESCs in vivo during teratoma formation from control and DNMAML-transduced hESCs. GFP (control) and DNMAML-transduced ESCs (both"
https://openalex.org/W2106735088,"Background The development of a safe and effective AD vaccine requires a delicate balance between providing an adequate anti-Aβ antibody response sufficient to provide therapeutic benefit, while eliminating an adverse T cell-mediated proinflammatory autoimmune response. To achieve this goal we have designed a prototype chemokine-based DNA epitope vaccine expressing a fusion protein that consists of 3 copies of the self-B cell epitope of Aβ42 (Aβ1–11) , a non-self T helper cell epitope (PADRE), and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22) as a molecular adjuvant to promote a strong anti-inflammatory Th2 phenotype. Methods and Findings We generated pMDC-3Aβ1–11-PADRE construct and immunized 3xTg-AD mouse model starting at age of 3–4 months old. We demonstrated that prophylactic immunizations with the DNA epitope vaccine generated a robust Th2 immune response that induced high titers of anti-Aβ antibody, which in turn inhibited accumulation of Aβ pathology in the brains of older mice. Importantly, vaccination reduced glial activation and prevented the development of behavioral deficits in aged animals without increasing the incidence of microhemorrhages. Conclusions Data from this transitional pre-clinical study suggest that our DNA epitope vaccine could be used as a safe and effective strategy for AD therapy. Future safety and immunology studies in large animals with the goal to achieve effective humoral immunity without adverse effects should help to translate this study to human clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2138373169,"Many biological processes are intrinsically dynamic, incurring profound changes at both molecular and physiological levels. Systems analyses of such processes incorporating large-scale transcriptome or proteome profiling can be quite revealing. Although consistency between mRNA and proteins is often implicitly assumed in many studies, examples of divergent trends are frequently observed. Here, we present a comparative transcriptome and proteome analysis of growth and stationary phase adaptation in Streptomyces coelicolor, taking the time-dynamics of process into consideration. These processes are of immense interest in microbiology as they pertain to the physiological transformations eliciting biosynthesis of many naturally occurring therapeutic agents. A shotgun proteomics approach based on mass spectrometric analysis of isobaric stable isotope labeled peptides (iTRAQ) enabled identification and rapid quantification of approximately 14% of the theoretical proteome of S. coelicolor. Independent principal component analyses of this and DNA microarray-derived transcriptome data revealed that the prominent patterns in both protein and mRNA domains are surprisingly well correlated. Despite this overall correlation, by employing a systematic concordance analysis, we estimated that over 30% of the analyzed genes likely exhibited significantly divergent patterns, of which nearly one-third displayed even opposing trends. Integrating this data with biological information, we discovered that certain groups of functionally related genes exhibit mRNA-protein discordance in a similar fashion. Our observations suggest that differences between mRNA and protein synthesis/degradation mechanisms are prominent in microbes while reaffirming the plausibility of such mechanisms acting in a concerted fashion at a protein complex or sub-pathway level."
https://openalex.org/W2083252919,"Conditional transgenic models have established that tumors require sustained oncogene activation for tumor maintenance, exhibiting the phenomenon known as ""oncogene-addiction."" However, most cancers are caused by multiple genetic events making it difficult to determine which oncogenes or combination of oncogenes will be the most effective targets for their treatment.To examine how the MYC and K-ras(G12D) oncogenes cooperate for the initiation and maintenance of tumorigenesis, we generated double conditional transgenic tumor models of lung adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. The ability of MYC and K-ras(G12D) to cooperate for tumorigenesis and the ability of the inactivation of these oncogenes to result in tumor regression depended upon the specific tissue context. MYC-, K-ras(G12D)- or MYC/K-ras(G12D)-induced lymphomas exhibited sustained regression upon the inactivation of either or both oncogenes. However, in marked contrast, MYC-induced lung tumors failed to regress completely upon oncogene inactivation; whereas K-ras(G12D)-induced lung tumors regressed completely. Importantly, the combined inactivation of both MYC and K-ras(G12D) resulted more frequently in complete lung tumor regression. To account for the different roles of MYC and K-ras(G12D) in maintenance of lung tumors, we found that the down-stream mediators of K-ras(G12D) signaling, Stat3 and Stat5, are dephosphorylated following conditional K-ras(G12D) but not MYC inactivation. In contrast, Stat3 becomes dephosphorylated in lymphoma cells upon inactivation of MYC and/or K-ras(G12D). Interestingly, MYC-induced lung tumors that failed to regress upon MYC inactivation were found to have persistent Stat3 and Stat5 phosphorylation.Taken together, our findings point to the importance of the K-Ras and associated down-stream Stat effector pathways in the initiation and maintenance of lymphomas and lung tumors. We suggest that combined targeting of oncogenic pathways is more likely to be effective in the treatment of lung cancers and lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2072313690,"Oxidative skeletal muscles are more resistant than glycolytic muscles to cachexia caused by chronic heart failure and other chronic diseases. The molecular mechanism for the protection associated with oxidative phenotype remains elusive. We hypothesized that differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) determine the fiber type susceptibility. Here, we show that intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in mice resulted in higher level of ROS and greater expression of muscle-specific E3 ubiqitin ligases, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)/atrogin-1 and muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF1), in glycolytic white vastus lateralis muscle than in oxidative soleus muscle. By contrast, NO production, inducible NO synthase (iNos) and antioxidant gene expression were greatly enhanced in oxidative, but not in glycolytic muscles, suggesting that NO mediates protection against muscle wasting. NO donors enhanced iNos and antioxidant gene expression and blocked cytokine/endotoxin-induced MAFbx/atrogin-1 expression in cultured myoblasts and in skeletal muscle in vivo. Our studies reveal a novel protective mechanism in oxidative myofibers mediated by enhanced iNos and antioxidant gene expression and suggest a significant value of enhanced NO signaling as a new therapeutic strategy for cachexia."
https://openalex.org/W2044611006,"The amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) peptide has been suggested to play a causative role in Alzheimer disease (AD). Neprilysin (NEP) is one of the rate-limiting Abeta-degrading enzymes, and its enhancement ameliorates extracellular amyloid pathology, synaptic dysfunction, and memory defects in mouse models of Abeta amyloidosis. In addition to the extracellular Abeta, intraneuronal Abeta42 may contribute to AD pathogenesis. However, the protective effects of neuronal NEP expression on intraneuronal Abeta42 accumulation and neurodegeneration remain elusive. In contrast, sustained NEP activation may be detrimental because NEP can degrade many physiological peptides, but its consequences in the brain are not fully understood. Using transgenic Drosophila expressing human NEP and Abeta42, we demonstrated that NEP efficiently suppressed the formation of intraneuronal Abeta42 deposits and Abeta42-induced neuron loss. However, neuronal NEP overexpression reduced cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-mediated transcription, caused age-dependent axon degeneration, and shortened the life span of the flies. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of endogenous fly NEP genes and phosphoramidon-sensitive NEP activity declined during aging in fly brains, as observed in mammals. Taken together, these data suggest both the protective and detrimental effects of chronically high NEP activity in the brain. Down-regulation of NEP activity in aging brains may be an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon, which could predispose humans to developing late-onset AD."
https://openalex.org/W2039200189,"Background There have been resurgent efforts in Africa to estimate the public health impact of malaria control interventions such as insecticide treated nets (ITNs) following substantial investments in scaling-up coverage in the last five years. Little is known, however, on the effectiveness of ITN in areas of Africa that support low transmission. This hinders the accurate estimation of impact of ITN use on disease burden and its cost-effectiveness in low transmission settings. Methods and Principal Findings Using a stratified two-stage cluster sample design, four cross-sectional studies were undertaken between March-June 2007 across three livelihood groups in an area of low intensity malaria transmission in South Central Somalia. Information on bed net use; age; and sex of all participants were recorded. A finger prick blood sample was taken from participants to examine for parasitaemia. Mantel-Haenzel methods were used to measure the effect of net use on parasitaemia adjusting for livelihood; age; and sex. A total of 10,587 individuals of all ages were seen of which 10,359 provided full information. Overall net use and parasite prevalence were 12.4% and 15.7% respectively. Age-specific protective effectiveness (PE) of bed net ranged from 39% among <5 years to 72% among 5–14 years old. Overall PE of bed nets was 54% (95% confidence interval 44%–63%) after adjusting for livelihood; sex; and age. Conclusions and Significance Bed nets confer high protection against parasite infection in South Central Somalia. In such areas where baseline transmission is low, however, the absolute reductions in parasitaemia due to wide-scale net use will be relatively small raising questions on the cost-effectiveness of covering millions of people living in such settings in Africa with nets. Further understanding of the progress of disease upon infection against the cost of averting its consequent burden in low transmission areas of Africa is therefore required."
https://openalex.org/W2092981040,"The Janzen-Connell model states that plant-specific natural enemies may have a disproportionately large negative effect on progeny close to maternal trees. The majority of experimental and theoretical studies addressing the Janzen-Connell model have explored how it can explain existing patterns of species diversity in tropical mainland areas. Very few studies have investigated how the model's predictions apply to isolated oceanic islands, or to the conservation management of endangered plants. Here, we provide the first experimental investigation of the predictions of the Janzen-Connell model on an oceanic island, in a conservation context. In addition, we experimentally evaluate the use of ecological analogue animals to resurrect the functional component of extinct frugivores that could have dispersed seeds away from maternal trees.In Mauritius, we investigated seed germination and seedling survival patterns of the critically endangered endemic plant Syzygium mamillatum (Myrtaceae) in relation to proximity to maternal trees. We found strong negative effects of proximity to maternal trees on growth and survival of seedlings. We successfully used giant Aldabran tortoises as ecological analogues for extinct Mauritian frugivores. Effects of gut-passage were negative at the seed germination stage, but seedlings from gut-passed seeds grew taller, had more leaves, and suffered less damage from natural enemies than any of the other seedlings.We provide the first experimental evidence of a distance-dependent Janzen-Connell effect on an oceanic island. Our results potentially have serious implications for the conservation management of rare plant species on oceanic islands, which harbour a disproportionately large fraction of the world's endemic and endangered plants. Furthermore, in contrast to recent controversy about the use of non-indigenous extant megafauna for re-wilding projects in North America and elsewhere, we argue that Mauritius and other oceanic islands are ideal study systems in which to empirically explore the use of ecological analogue species in restoration ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2075832074,"Background In the Neotropics, nearly 35% of amphibian species are threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and habitat split; anuran species with different developmental modes respond to habitat disturbance in different ways. This entails broad-scale strategies for conserving biodiversity and advocates for the identification of high conservation-value regions that are significant in a global or continental context and that could underpin more detailed conservation assessments towards such areas. Methodology/Principal Findings We identified key ecoregion sets for anuran conservation using an algorithm that favors complementarity (beta-diversity) among ecoregions. Using the WWF's Wildfinder database, which encompasses 700 threatened anuran species in 119 Neotropical ecoregions, we separated species into those with aquatic larvae (AL) or terrestrial development (TD), as this life-history trait affects their response to habitat disturbance. The conservation target of 100% of species representation was attained with a set of 66 ecoregions. Among these, 30 were classified as priority both for species with AL and TD, 26 were priority exclusively for species with AL, and 10 for species with TD only. Priority ecoregions for both developmental modes are concentrated in the Andes and in Mesoamerica. Ecoregions important for conserving species with AL are widely distributed across the Neotropics. When anuran life histories were ignored, species with AL were always underrepresented in priority sets. Conclusions/Significance The inclusion of anuran developmental modes in prioritization analyses resulted in more comprehensive coverage of priority ecoregions–especially those essential for species that require an aquatic habitat for their reproduction–when compared to usual analyses that do not consider this life-history trait. This is the first appraisal of the most important regions for conservation of threatened Neotropical anurans. It is also a first endeavor including anuran life-history traits in priority area-selection for conservation, with a clear gain in comprehensiveness of the selection process."

To gain insight into whole saliva enzymatic processes, the in vivo generated peptides in this oral fluid were subjected to nano-flow liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The 182 peptides identified were predominantly derived from acidic and basic proline-rich proteins, statherin, and histatins. The proteolytic cleavages in the basic proline-rich proteins occurred preferentially after a Gln residue with predominant specificity for the tripeptide Xaa-Pro-Gln, where Xaa in the P(3) position was mostly represented by Lys. Using the synthetic substrates Lys-Pro-Gln-pNA and Gly-Gly-Gln-pNA, the overall K(m) values were determined to be 97 +/- 7.7 and 611 +/- 28 microm, respectively, confirming glutamine endoprotease activity in whole saliva and the influence of the amino acids in positions P(2) and P(3) on protease recognition. The pH optimum of Lys-Pro-Gln-pNA hydrolysis was 7.0, and the activity was most effectively inhibited by antipain and 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, was metal ion-dependent, and not inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors. A systematic evaluation of enzyme activities in various exocrine and nonexocrine contributors to whole saliva revealed that the glutamine endoprotease is derived from dental plaque and likely microbial in origin. The P(1) site being occupied by a Gln residue is a nonarchetype with respect to known proteases and indicates the presence of novel glutamine-specific endoprotease(s) in oral fluid."
https://openalex.org/W1968722252,"Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) fails in approximately half of genotype 1 patients. Treatment failure occurs either by nonresponse (minimal declines in viral titer) or relapse (robust initial responses followed by rebounds of viral titers during or after therapy). HCV is highly variable genetically. To determine if viral genetic differences contribute to the difference between response and relapse, we examined the inter-patient genetic diversity and mutation pattern in the full open reading frame HCV genotype 1a consensus sequences.Pre- and post-therapy sequences were analyzed for 10 nonresponders and 10 relapsers from the Virahep-C clinical study. Pre-therapy interpatient diversity among the relapsers was higher than in the nonresponders in the viral NS2 and NS3 genes, and post-therapy diversity was higher in the relapsers for most of HCV's ten genes. Pre-therapy diversity among the relapsers was intermediate between that of the non-responders and responders to therapy. The average mutation rate was just 0.9% at the amino acid level and similar numbers of mutations occurred in the nonresponder and relapser sequences, but the mutations in NS2 of relapsers were less conservative than in nonresponders. Finally, the number and distribution of regions under positive selection was similar between the two groups, although the nonresponders had more foci of positive selection in E2.The HCV sequences were unexpectedly stable during failed antiviral therapy, both nonresponder and relapser sequences were under selective pressure during therapy, and variation in NS2 may have contributed to the difference in response between the nonresponder and relapser groups. These data support a role for viral genetic variability in determining the outcome of anti-HCV therapy, with those sequences that are more distant from an optimal sequence being less able to resist the pressures of interferon-based therapy.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00038974."

Designated VTC5, this enzyme displays substrate specificity and enzymatic properties that are remarkably similar to those of VTC2, suggesting that it may be responsible for residual vitamin C synthesis in vtc2 mutants.

Second, consistent with the sequence relationship of VTC2 as a HIT protein, does this enzyme proceed through a guanylylated histidine intermediate? Third, does the guanylylated intermediate of VTC2 become resolved by simple phosphorolysis (i.e. transfer to phosphate) as we reported (13Linster C.L. Gomez T.A. Christensen K.C. Adler L.N.

For growth on agar-solidified medium, seeds were surface-sterilized (50% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite, 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 10 min with gentle agitation) and then washed 5 times in sterile water. The seeds, resuspended in sterile water, were vernalized for 2 days at 4 °C before being sown on Murashige and Skoog medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.7% (w/v) agar in Magenta G-7 boxes (Sigma). After 10 days of growth at 22 °C under continuous light (∼40 μmol m–2 s–1), plants were harvested, flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at –80 °C until used for protein extraction. Similar GDP-d-Glc and GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase activities were measured in extracts obtained from plants grown under the two conditions described. Japanese mustard spinach (Brassica rapa var. komatsuna), lemon tree (Citrus limon), and maize (Zea mays) leaves were freshly harvested from plants grown in the outside garden of the UCLA greenhouse, whereas tobacco (Nicotiana rustica) leaves were collected from greenhouse grown plants. Kiwifruit leaves were harvested from a female plant purchased at a local nursery. Finally, fresh spinach leaves were purchased at a local supermarket. All the leaves were washed with deionized water and then stored at –80 °C until used for protein extraction. Cloning of A. thaliana VTC2 and VTC5—The A. thaliana VTC2 cDNA was cloned as described in Linster et al. (13Linster C.L. Gomez T.A. Christensen K.C. Adler L.N. Young B.D. Brenner C. Clarke S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18879-18885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A similar approach was taken to clone the A. thaliana VTC5 cDNA. In short, the VTC5 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from the U11937 clone containing the coding sequence of the At5g55120 gene (prepared by the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (18Yamada K.

The resulting DNA was cloned into the Champion pET100/D-Topo vector (Invitrogen), and this plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells. The DNA sequences of both the VTC2 and VTC5 inserts were confirmed. Preparation of VTC2 Mutant Proteins—VTC2 mutants were constructed by the PCR and DpnI method (19Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and DpnI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The pET100/D-Topo plasmid containing the VTC2 coding sequence was used as the mutagenesis template. The sense strand mutagenic primers used for the amino acid substitutions were 5′-CATACTTCAGACTCGATTACAACAGCTTGGG for G224D, 5′-CTATCAATCATCTCAACTTTCAGGCTTATTA for H238N, and 5′-CTATGCAAGAACTATTTGATACTGTTTCAGA for S290F. The underlined nucleotides indicate the mutations, which were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing the mutant cDNAs were used to transform E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells for purification of mutant VTC2 proteins, designated VTC2-G224D, VTC2-H238N, and VTC2-S290F. Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant VTC2, VTC2 Mutants, and VTC5—Recombinant wild-type and mutant VTC2 enzymes as well as wild-type VTC5 protein were overexpressed and purified as described in Linster et al. (13Linster C.L. Gomez T.A. Christensen K.C. Adler L.N. Young B.D. Brenner C. Clarke S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18879-18885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with the exception that the lysis buffer contained 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein concentration was determined using a Lowry assay after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Purified enzyme was stored at –80 °C in 10% glycerol. Activity Assays of Recombinant VTC2, VTC2 Mutants, and VTC5—The phosphorylase activity of recombinant VTC2, VTC2 mutants, and VTC5 was assayed as described in Linster et al. (13Linster C.L. Gomez T.A. Christensen K.C. Adler L.N. Young B.D. Brenner C. Clarke S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18879-18885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In short, GDP formation was measured by anion-exchange HPLC after incubation of recombinant enzyme with various GDP-hexose substrates in a reaction mixture, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm (unless otherwise indicated) sodium phosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions (26 °C) were initiated by the addition of enzyme and stopped after the indicated times by heating at 98 °C for 3 min. To assay the enzymatic activity in the reverse direction, GDP-hexose formation was measured by the same HPLC method after incubation of the enzyme with the indicated hexose 1-phosphate and 5 mm GDP as described above except that sodium phosphate and MgCl2 were omitted from the reaction mixture. The GDP-l-Gal-hexose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase activities of recombinant VTC2 and VTC5 were measured by replacing the sodium phosphate used in the phosphorylase assay by the indicated concentrations of d-Glc-1-P or d-Man-1-P and by monitoring GDP-d-Glc or GDP-d-Man formation by the same anion-exchange HPLC method than the one used for the phosphorylase assay. GDP and GDP-hexose concentrations were calculated by comparing the integrated peak areas with those of standard GDP or GDP-d-Man solutions. The GDP-l-Gal (substrate of the transferase activity) and GDP-d-Glc (product of the transferase activity) peaks partially overlapped. To estimate the total peak area of the GDP-d-Glc (which elutes just before GDP-l-Gal) formed, we generally split the peak at the summit and multiplied the left half-peak area by 2. However, because of an asymmetry of the peaks toward the right, this can lead to an underestimation of the GDP-d-Glc concentrations and, thus, the GDP-l-Gal-d-Glc-1-P guanylyltransferase activities by as much as 35%. Preparation and Assay of Partially Purified Plant Extracts—A. thaliana extracts were prepared from whole plants. All other plant extracts used in this study were derived from leaves. Plant tissue was ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 3 volumes of extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) per gram of extract powder. For extracts prepared from kiwifruit leaves, the extraction buffer was added in a 4:1 (v/w) ratio, and it additionally contained 2% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (Sigma). For all plant tissues, the resuspended powder was then centrifuged for 20 min (4 °C) at 20,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant filtered through one layer of Miracloth. This preparation was either stored at –80 °C or immediately subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. Protein precipitating between 35 and 50% saturating ammonium sulfate (ICN Biomedicals, Ultra Pure) was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. These fractions were desalted on protein desalting spin columns in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (Pierce) immediately before being used for activity measurements. GDP-d-Glc/GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase and GDP-l-Gal-hexose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase activities were assayed as described for recombinant VTC2 and VTC5 proteins, except that NaCl and MgCl2 were omitted from the reaction mixtures. Liquid Column Chromatography Coupled to Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Recombinant wild-type VTC2 (0.28 mg/ml) and VTC2-H238N (0.48 mg/ml) proteins were incubated for 5 min (26 °C) with 21 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and in the absence or presence of 60 μm GDP-d-Glc and then kept on ice until liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis. The samples (100 μl) were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC using a PLRP-S polymeric column with a pore size of 300 Å, a bead size of 5 μm, and 150 × 2.1-mm dimensions (Polymer Laboratories, Amherst, MA). The column was equilibrated in 80% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and 20% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). After a 5-min wash at 20% B, proteins were eluted using a gradient changing from 20% to 60% B in 40 min, with a final increase to 100% B during an additional 5 min, all at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. An API III+ mass spectrometer (PE Sciex) was tuned and calibrated as described previously (20Whitelegge J.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 251: 323-340PubMed Google Scholar) to yield a mass accuracy of 0.02%. VTC2 Point Mutants Lack Enzymatic Activity—Three mutations in the VTC2 gene (vtc2-1, vtc2-2, and vtc2-3) are known to lead to partial vitamin C deficiency in A. thaliana plants (11Conklin P.L. Saracco S.A. Norris S.R. Last R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the vtc2-1 mutation consists in a G to A base change at the predicted 3′ splice site of intron 5, the vtc2-2 and vtc2-3 mutations have been found to correspond to mis-sense mutations leading to G224D and S290F substitutions, respectively (21Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). To test the effect of the latter mutations on enzyme activity, we have introduced them in the VTC2 coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. We have also prepared a mutant allele in which the predicted catalytic residue of VTC2, His-238 (see below), has been replaced by an Asn residue. Overexpression and purification yielded relatively high amounts of the recombinant VTC2-H238N protein (Fig. 1). Production of the VTC2-G224D and VTC2-S290F mutants proved more difficult, and only low amounts of protein could be detected (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE analysis of the pellets and supernatants obtained after centrifugation of the bacterial lysates showed that the VTC2-S290F mutant was mostly insoluble and that the VTC2-G224D mutant appeared to have been entirely degraded (data not shown). With the VTC2-H238N and VTC2-S290F preparations, we detected only very low residual phosphorylase activities both in the presence of GDP-l-Gal and GDP-d-Glc (Table 1). These residual activities were, however, significantly higher than those detected in the presence of the VTC2-G224D preparation and, thus, do not seem to be contributed by bacterial contaminants. The phosphorylase activities of the VTC2-H238N mutant were at least 30,000-fold lower than the wild-type activities. Because of the low level of soluble expression of the VTC2-S290F mutant, we were unable to calculate its activity relative to the wild-type enzyme.TABLE 1Phosphorylase activities of wild-type and mutant VTC2 enzymesSubstratePhosphorylase activity25 μm GDP-l-Gal50 μm GDP-d-Glcnmol min-1 mg protein-1VTC2 (wild type)15,100 ± 2,10014,200 ± 2,100VTC2-H238N0.51 ± 0.070.27 ± 0.05VTC2-S290F0.50 ± 0.120.56 ± 0.09VTC2-G224D0.054 ± 0.0060.013 ± 0.128 Open table in a new tab VTC5 Is a VTC2-paralogous Enzyme—The vtc2-2 and vtc2-3 mutants had previously been shown to contain ∼30 and 50%, respectively, of the ascorbate present in wild-type plants (11Conklin P.L. Saracco S.A. Norris S.R. Last R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The very low activities detected with the VTC2-G224D and VTC2-S290F mutants, thus, raised the question of the origin of these residual vitamin C contents. BLAST searches revealed that the A. thaliana genome encodes a protein sharing high sequence identity with VTC2. We cloned and overexpressed the corresponding gene (At5g55120) and purified the expression product (Fig. 1, lane 2) using the same procedures as those used to produce His-tagged VTC2 (13Linster C.L.

We found that At5g55120 encodes a GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase whose biochemical properties closely resemble those of VTC2 (Table 2) and which might, thus, account for the residual vitamin C levels found in vtc2 mutants. During the course of these studies Dowdle et al. (16Dowdle J. Ishikawa T. Gatzek S. Rolinski S. Smirnoff N. Plant J. 2007; 52: 673-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) also overexpressed At5g55120 and characterized the gene product, which they named VTC5, as a GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase.TABLE 2Comparison of the substrate specificities of A. thaliana VTC2 and VTC5SubstrateKmkcatkcat/KmVTC2VTC5VTC2VTC5VTC2VTC5mms-1m-1 s-1Forward reaction GDP-l-Gal0.0079 ± 0.00110.0083 ± 0.003227 ± 513 ± 23.4 ± 1.1 × 1061.6 ± 0.3 × 106 GDP-d-GlcaFor these substrates the values given for the VTC2 enzyme were taken from Linster et al.

Open table in a new tab We first characterized the substrate specificity of VTC5 for nucleotide sugars. As shown in Table 2, both VTC2 and VTC5 use GDP-l-Gal and GDP-d-Glc with high catalytic efficiencies, although the values obtained for VTC5 are ∼2- and 7-fold, respectively, lower than those calculated for VTC2. GDP-d-Man is a very poor substrate for both enzymes. We could, however, detect significant phosphorylase activities with both enzymes in the presence of GDP-l-Fuc, which is the 6-deoxy derivative of GDP-l-Gal. About 10-fold lower phosphorylase activities were measured in the presence of ∼80 μm GDP-l-Fuc (2.4 ± 0.1 μmol min–1 mg of protein–1 for VTC2 and 1.1 ± 0.1 μmol min–1 mg of protein–1 for VTC5) than in the presence of a near-saturating (∼50 μm) concentration of the physiological substrate GDP-l-Gal (25 ± 5 μmol min–1 mg of protein–1 for VTC2 and 12 ± 1 μmol min–1 mg of protein–1 for VTC5). Similar to the situation with VTC2 (13Linster C.L. Gomez T.A. Christensen K.C. Adler L.N. Young B.D. Brenner C. Clarke S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18879-18885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), no phosphorylase activity could be detected with VTC5 when UDP-d-Glc, UDP-d-Gal, or ADP-d-Glc was used as a substrate (all tested at 0.5 mm; data not shown). Using a mixture obtained by incubation of GDP-d-Man with GDP-d-mannose 3′,5′-epimerase and containing GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal, and GDP-l-gulose in a 82:15:3 ratio, we could not detect any GDP-l-gulose phosphorolysis in the presence of VTC5 and under conditions where about 80% consumption of GDP-l-Gal was observed (data not shown); a similar result was found previously with VTC2 (13Linster C.L. Gomez T.A. Christensen K.C. Adler L.N. Young B.D. Brenner C. Clarke S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18879-18885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We then examined the affinity for phosphate as a substrate. VTC5 showed a 2.5- and 3.5-fold higher affinity for Pi than VTC2 in the presence of GDP-l-Gal and GDP-d-Glc, respectively. Finally, we compared the ability of VTC5 and VTC2 to carry out the reverse reaction (hexose-1-P + GDP → GDP-hexose + Pi). Both enzymes are much more efficient in phosphorolyzing GDP-l-Gal or GDP-d-Glc than in catalyzing the corresponding reverse reactions (Table 2). However, this difference in efficiency for the forward and reverse reactions is more pronounced in the case of VTC2. The specificity constants for the forward reactions with GDP-l-Gal and GDP-d-Glc are ∼26,000- and 14,000-fold, respectively, higher than the ones for the reverse reactions in the case of VTC2, whereas for VTC5 these ratios amount to ∼6400- and 1500-fold, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that VTC2 and VTC5 catalyze similar reactions with similar kinetics. VTC2 Forms a His-238-dependent Guanylylated Intermediate—The alignment of plant VTC2 sequences and their vertebrate and invertebrate homologs revealed the presence of a conserved motif (His-ϕ-His-ϕ-His/Gln, where ϕ is a hydrophobic amino acid) characteristic of the members of the HIT protein superfamily (13Linster C.L.

Wright M.A. Cooney J. Bulley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9534-9539Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). HIT enzymes consist of nucleoside monophosphate hydrolases and nucleoside monophosphate transferases which attack the α-phosphate of the monophosphonucleoside moiety of their substrates by the second His of the HIT motif, forming a covalent nucleotidylylated intermediate (15Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). While the nucleotidylylated intermediate is simply hydrolyzed in the case of HIT hydrolases, this intermediate is stable to water in HIT transferases and awaits reaction with Pi (phosphorolysis) or a specific phosphorylated substrate (transfer). We know that A. thaliana VTC2 requires the presence of Pi to convert its GDP-hexose substrates (GDP-l-Gal and GDP-d-Glc) to GDP and the corresponding hexose 1-phosphates (l-Gal-1-P and d-Glc-1-P, respectively) (13Linster C.L.

Physiological NO signals are transduced through receptors equipped with guanylyl cyclase (GC) activity, leading to the intracellular formation of the effector molecule, cGMP (3Koesling D. Russwurm M. Mergia E. Mullershausen F. Friebe A. Neurochem. Int. 2004; 45: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The discovery in homogenates of a “soluble” GC (4Chrisman T.D. Garbers D.L.

Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1977; 3: 23-35PubMed Google Scholar) was vital for the identification of NO as an endogenous signaling agent. Nevertheless, despite many years of study, the mechanism of NO signal transduction through this pathway and the ways it is regulated remain indistinct. This is disappointing, because, as exemplified by synaptic transmission (6Clements J.D.

In the current scheme (Fig. 1), the NO binding site is a heme prosthetic group, the occupation of which results in disengagement of a coordinating histidine bond, which helps drive a conformational change that propagates to the catalytic domain, resulting in the conversion of GTP into cGMP and pyrophosphate.

Although a good starting point, the two-step reaction ignores many other regulatory mechanisms. As well as being a substrate, GTP has been pictured as facilitating the NO-induced conformational change in a manner that is inhibited competitively by physiological concentrations of ATP (22Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Ruiz-Stewart I. Tiyyagura S.R. Lin J.E. Kazerounian S. Pitari G.M.

An uncompetitive component to the activity of ATP has also been identified (23Ruiz-Stewart I. Tiyyagura S.R. Lin J.E. Kazerounian S. Pitari G.M. Schulz S. Martin E. Murad F. Waldman S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), depicted in Fig. 1 as being at the catalytic site. There are, in addition, sites where allosteric modulators, such as YC-1, act to augment NO-evoked activity (24Friebe A. Koesling D. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) putatively by inhibiting the rate at which the enzymatically active species reverts to its inactive state (20Garthwaite J. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although giving a reasonable empirical description, the resulting phenomenological scheme (Fig. 1) gives little useful information about the underlying mechanisms. In reality, the protein is an enzyme-linked receptor having binding sites for various agonists, antagonists, and modulators and an integral catalytic domain, where substrate and products bind and unbind. We sought here to gather the data necessary for assembling a more complete, mechanism-based model of the receptor-enzyme. Materials—2–4-Carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (CPTIO), diethylamine NONOate, spermine NONOate, purified bovine lung GC (soluble guanylyl cyclase), and BAY 41-2272 were obtained from Axxora (UK) Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). Remaining special chemicals were from Sigma. NONOate stock solutions were made up in 10 mm NaOH on the day of use and kept on ice. Measurement of GC Activity—The purification of the bovine lung protein used and its characteristics have been described in detail (25Russwurm M. Koesling D. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As before (26Bellamy T.C. Griffiths C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31801-31807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the supplied protein (250 μg/ml in 50% glycerol, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm triethanolamine at pH 7.4) was diluted to 5 μg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin and maintained on ice; aliquots were diluted 1:100 in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 μm EDTA, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mm urate, 1000 units/ml superoxide dismutase, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) containing GTP (0.01–1 mm), ATP (0–10 mm), and MgCl2 in concentrations giving 300 μm in excess of the total nucleotide concentration, prewarmed to 37 °C. NO was usually delivered in known, clamped concentrations by adding combinations of the NO donor spermine NONOate and the NO scavenger CPTIO as described (13Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In some experiments (specified under “Results”), a saturating NO concentration was applied using diethylamine NONOate (1 μm). The incubations were at 37 °C and, unless stated otherwise, lasted for 2 min, after which aliquots were removed and inactivated in boiling 50 mm Tris, 4 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.4), and cGMP was subsequently measured by radioimmunoassay. In each experiment, three or four independent runs were carried out for each condition, and the resulting data are presented as means ± S.E. Model Formulation—The model comprised a binding module with a juxtaposed catalytic site. The full binding module (Fig. 2A) is analogous to the cubic ternary complex used for modeling G-protein-coupled receptors (27Weiss J.M. Morgan P.H. Lutz M.W. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 178: 151-167Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The very low activity observed in the absence of NO (see “Results”) allows the binding scheme to be simplified, as shown in Fig. 2B. Catalysis proceeds from the active, NO- and GTP-bound species and is assumed to follow the same mechanism deduced for adenylyl cyclase (28Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), wherein GTP is first split into cGMP and pyrophosphate, and then the products leave one at a time (Fig. 2B). The binding steps are likely to be close to equilibrium when the reaction as a whole is at steady state, so the first aim was to obtain estimates of the equilibrium constants. Using the notation of Colquhoun (29Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) for the cubic ternary complex (Fig. 2A), when activity in the absence of agonist is low (i.e. when the value of E0 in Fig. 2A is small), the EC50 for NO is given by Equation 1, EC50(NO)=KA(1+GKG)1+GKGA+EA(1+GKGA∗)(Eq. 1) where G represents the GTP concentration, and other parameters are as in Fig. 2A. This equation may also be written as follows. EC50(NO)=KA(1+GKG)1+GgKG+EA(1+GKGA∗)(Eq. 2) Abbreviating [NO] as N, the EC50 for GTP is as follows. EC50(GTP)=KG(1+NKA+E0(1+NKA∗))1+NKAG+EG(1+NKAG∗)(Eq. 3) When [NO] is high relative to its binding affinities, and since E0/KA* = EA/KA, EG/KAG* = EAG/KAG, and KA/KAG = g, Equation 3 closely approximates the following. EC50(GTP)=KG(1+EA)g(1+EAG)(Eq. 4) Since EAG = KGAEA/KGA*, Equation 4 may also be written as follows. EC50(GTP)=KGKGA∗(1+EA)EAKG+gKGA∗(Eq. 5) By finding the EC50(NO) at two different concentrations of GTP, equating them using Equation 2 (whence KA cancels out), solving for g, and inserting the result in Equation 5, EA and KGA* cancel out, and the value of KG comes to the following, KG=GE(f−r)+G2r(f−1)E(1−f)+G(1−fr)(Eq. 6) where E represents the EC50(GTP) at high [NO], and f is the factor by which the EC50(NO) increases when [GTP] (G) is reduced by the factor r. In the results, we see that with [GTP] = 1 mm, f = 1.57 when r = 0.1, and the EC50(GTP) at 50 nm NO is 64 μm, giving KG = 187 μm. Having this value and a value of KGA* restricts the values of all of the other equilibrium constants. For example, putting KG = 187 μm and KGA* = 25 μm (see “Results”) into Equation 5 gives the relationship between EC50(GTP), g, and EA. With an EC50(GTP) of 64 μm, g = 2.92 - 4.56EA. Since g must be at least 1 (otherwise NO would become less potent as [GTP] increases, contrary to observation), the maximal value of EA (when g = 1) comes to 0.42, and the maximal value of g (when EA = 0) is 2.92. Estimates of the ranges of NO binding affinities (KA and KAG) are arrived at from Equation 2 using minimum and maximum values of EA and the corresponding values of g (Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of error in the EC50 for GTP on other parametersParameterEC50(GTP) at 50 nm NO55 μm64 μm75 μmKG (μm)170187209KGA (μm)252525g1–3.11–2.91–2.8KGA (μm)55–17064–18775–209KA (nm)2.9–4.52.7–3.82.6–3.4KAG (nm)0.93–4.50.93–3.80.92–3.4EAG≤3.8≤3.1≤2.7EA≤0.56≤0.42≤0.33EA (EAG = 1)0.15–0.450.13–0.390.12–0.33 Open table in a new tab A further constraint comes from measuring the increase in maximal GC activity observed in the presence of an allosteric enhancer (see “Results”); assuming this enhanced response is maximal, the efficacy normally is about 70% of maximum. The main determinant of efficacy is the constant governing the transition of the NO- and GTP-bound species to its active form (EAG in Fig. 2); setting EAG = 1 gives the desired efficacies in the absence and presence of the allosteric enhancer (when the full model is run) and also further restricts the value of the constant for the corresponding GTP-free state (EA; Table 1). Even allowing for errors in the estimation of the EC50(GTP), the range of suitable constants becomes very limited (Table 1). By methodically altering the value of the factor g, the missing equilibrium constants best describing the data in Fig. 4 can easily be found; g = 2.0, KA = 3.65 nm, KAG = 1.83 nm, KGA = 94 μm, and EA = 0.27 give EC50(NO) values of 1.02 and 1.65 nm in the presence of 1 and 0.1 mm GTP, respectively, and an EC50(GTP) of 62 μm in the presence of 50 nm NO. Conversion of GTP into cGMP and pyrophosphate is assumed to follow the corresponding reaction in adenylyl cyclase because of the very similar underlying chemistry and the close homology of the catalytic centers, to the extent that swapping three amino acids is sufficient to convert NO-stimulated GC into NO-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (30Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The kinetics of a soluble form of adenylyl cyclase have been described (28Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and formed the basis of the GC catalytic module (Fig. 2B). A few adjustments were needed to improve thermodynamic balance and for the module to comply with data on GC. First, the maximum activity was raised to 15 μmol/mg/min, which was the typical value found in the present experiments, by increasing the constants for the rate-limiting steps (NR*G to NR*·cG·PPi, and NR*·PPi to NR*). Second, the rate constants for product binding were modified to give the inhibition by cGMP and pyrophosphate measured using recombinant NO-activated GC (31Lee Y.C. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It was necessary to include additional states that bind pyrophosphate to comply with the data (see “Results”); inclusion of these states made no significant difference to the other aspects of the model, so they were omitted for clarity elsewhere. Finally, the product binding and unbinding cycle (the upper right-hand triangle in Fig. 2B) was made to conform to the thermodynamic principle of microscopic reversibility (32Colquhoun D. Dowsland K.A. Beato M. Plested A.J. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3510-3518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This was achieved by increasing the rate constants for the minor product dissociation pathway (NR*·cG·PPi to NR*·cG and then to NR*) by factors of 10, a modification that had little effect on the output of the model. Using the deduced equilibrium constants for the binding module, introduction of catalysis caused a slight mismatch to the data (e.g. the modeled EC50(NO) values in the presence of 1 and 0.1 mm GTP fell to 0.67 and 1.15 nm from 1.02 and 1.65 nm, respectively). This arises because the draining of GTP at the catalytic site pulls the equilibrium in that direction. Changing the value of the factor g from 2.0 to 1.5 and setting the NO binding affinity for the GTP-free species (KA) to 4.23 nm (hence, altering EA to 0.2) gave the values that enabled good fits to all of the data reported here. To interface with the catalytic module, the equilibrium constants for the binding module had to be converted into microscopic rate constants. The bimolecular association rate for NO (3 × 108 m-1 s-1) was assigned from spectroscopic experiments, yielding >>1 × 107 m-1 s-1 at 15 °C (9Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayashi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and >1.4 × 108 m-1 s-1 at 4 °C (10Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). NO dissociation rates were the dissociation constants given in Fig. 2B multiplied by the association rate. The bimolecular association rate for GTP binding was initially set at 1 × 106 m-1 s-1 with dissociation rates then being set by the equilibrium constants. Tests for reactions at equilibrium were made by altering the forward and backward rate constants over a wide range (100–1000-fold, keeping the ratio the same) under conditions of varied NO and GTP concentrations, a discrepancy of 10% in cGMP output between the two extremes signifying a nonequilibrium state. All NO binding steps and most GTP binding steps were effectively at equilibrium. The reactions out of equilibrium were, in order of degree, those represented by the constants KGA*, EAG, and EA in Fig. 2. This arises because these reactions are closest to the catalytic site where GTP is consumed. Assignment of microscopic rate constants for these steps was on the basis of fits to experimental data (see supplemental Fig. S1). For ATP, all of the binding steps were effectively at equilibrium under steady-state conditions; the bimolecular rate constants for ATP binding to the GTP-free and GTP-bound states were set at 5 × 105 and 3 × 105 m-1 s-1, respectively. For allosteric modulation, from the model presented under “Results” (see Fig. 8), the EC50 for the allosteric enhancer (Y) under conditions of high [NO] and [GTP] and when EAGY is >>1 approximates the following, EC50(Y)=KY(1+EAG)EAGY(Eq. 7) where EAG = 1 (see above) and EAGY = KY/KY*, giving KY* = EC50(Y)/2. To complete the binding module, a starting value for EAGY was obtained from the rate of deactivation under conditions of high [NO] and [GTP], which is explicitly dependent on the microscopic rate constants for this step as well as on the rate of NO unbinding (19Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Keeping the forward rate constant unaltered (100 s-1), the deactivation rate constant (about 8 × 10-4 s-1; see “Results”) suggests a value for the backward rate constant of about 0.1 s-1. From this value, EAGY = 1000 and KY is 1000 times the value of KY* (found as above). Fine adjustments were made to obtain the best fits to the data. Microscopic rates for the unbinding of Y were calculated from the equilibrium constants, assuming a bimolecular association rate of 1 × 106 m-1 s-1. Differential equations drawn up to describe the steps in the model were solved using Mathcad 11 or 14 (Adept Scientific, Letchworth, UK). The model output is shown in many of the illustrations in the form of broken lines; conversion of model data (the rate of cGMP formation being in units of s-1) into the experimental units (pmol of cGMP formed/mg/min) assumed a molecular mass of 150 kDa for the NO receptor-enzyme. To facilitate comparison with experimental results, the model data are normalized to the measured activity, which varied from day to day presumably as a result of differences in the amount of active protein. In aiming to formulate a mechanism for NO-stimulated GC activity, the starting point was with the binding of NO and GTP. It was assumed that there is a single NO binding site, because NO concentration-response curves are monophasic with a slope of 1.0 (13Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Wykes V. Garthwaite J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For the same reasons, it was also assumed that there is a single site for GTP binding, which must be at the catalytic site. To be thermodynamically complete, there are eight different states, represented as a cube in Fig. 2A. This representation is analogous to the “cubic ternary complex” used to model G-protein-coupled receptors, where G in Fig. 2A (here standing for GTP) represents the G-protein (27Weiss J.M. Morgan P.H. Lutz M.W. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 178: 151-167Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The module allows for all possible interactions with NO at the ligand binding site and for GTP at the catalytic site and assumes that the interactions are governed by the laws of mass action. It further assumes that the receptor is either inactive or active, the latter states being represented by asterisks in Fig. 2A. Catalysis proceeds from the active GTP-bound states (R*G and NR*G), forming cGMP and pyrophosphate, which then dissociate, either one first followed by the other (as in Fig. 2B). Basal Activity—In the full version (Fig. 2A), catalysis could occur in the absence of NO (from the R*G species); this would represent a basal GC activity analogous to the intrinsic activity of some G-protein-coupled receptors (34Costa T. Cotecchia S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 618-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Usually, basal GC activity is taken to be that measured in the absence of added NO, but environmental NO will always be present in amounts that change with geographical location and time of day (35Friebe A. Malkewitz J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Nature. 1996; 382: 120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The unstimulated activity we recorded varied appreciably, ranging from 50 to 1500 nmol/mg/min, consistent with the fluctuations in environmental NO recorded in the locality (supplemental Fig. S2). To determine the true basal activity, the rate of cGMP formation was measured with increasing concentrations of the NO scavenger, CPTIO (Fig. 3A). On a day when the “basal” activity was fortuitously high (1.5 μmol/mg/min), CPTIO caused a concentration-dependent inhibition (IC50 = 2.3 μm), the activity remaining at the highest CPTIO concentration tested (3 mm) being very low (3 nmol/mg/min). This effect could not be ascribed to an unexpected inhibitory side effect of CPTIO on the receptor-enzyme, because, when the CPTIO concentration was varied 10-fold while maintaining the NO concentration constant (1 nm), there was no significant effect on the rate of cGMP formation (Fig. 3B). It can be concluded, therefore, that the true basal activity is at least 5000-fold lower than is observed maximally in the presence of NO (about 15 μmol/mg/min); accordingly, catalysis from the active unliganded species (R*G) can be disregarded. NO and GTP Binding—The very low activity in the absence of NO also means that the corresponding states in the mechanism (Fig. 2A) can be left aside, leading to the simplified model shown in Fig. 2B. The reactions of the binding module are likely to be close to equilibrium when the reaction as a whole is at steady state (36Cha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 820-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so the next step was to obtain estimates of the equilibrium constants. The best estimate of the binding constant for GTP in the active catalytic site (KGA* in Fig. 2B) is obtained under conditions of maximal activity, which is seen in the presence of a saturating concentration of an allosteric enhancer (see below). The observed value was 25 μm. The EC50 for NO is explicitly dependent on the GTP concentration. By measuring this dependence and also the EC50 for GTP at a high NO concentration, the constant for GTP binding to the unliganded receptor (KG) can be found (see “Experimental Procedures”). Reducing the GTP concentration from 1 mm to 100 μm resulted in only a small rightward shift in the NO concentration-response curve (Fig. 4A), the EC50 increasing from 1.0 to 1.6 nm. This result, together with an EC50 for GTP of 64 μm in the presence of 50 nm NO (Fig. 4B), gives the constant KG = 187 μm. The ranges of possible values for the remaining constants, especially those governing the binding of NO, were then severely restricted (Table 1). Their final values (Fig. 2B) together with those of the underlying forward and backward rates were assigned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Catalysis—Catalysis (Fig. 2B) was assumed to follow the same kinetic mechanism described for adenylyl cyclase (28Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a mechanism that has been well supported by structural information (37Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 205-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Adjustments were made to the kinetics to conform better to thermodynamic principles and the known properties of the NO-stimulated GC (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting maximum cGMP output is 15 μmol/mg/min (100 nm NO, 3 mm GTP), and it exhibits appropriate product inhibition. The IC50 for inhibition by cGMP is 11 mm (100 nm NO), which is essentially identical to the value reported for recombinant GC (31Lee Y.C. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Despite being an effective inhibitor of the NO-activated enzyme, cGMP was found to be much weaker under “basal” conditions and in the presence of YC-1 (IC50 > 50–100 mm). Both of these conditions were associated with relatively low GC activity. Simulating this situation in the enzyme-linked receptor model by progressively lowering the NO concentration duplicates this loss of potency of cGMP and offers an explanation for it (supplemental Fig. S3A). A similar activity dependence is predicted for inhibition by the other product, pyrophosphate, should it bind (in the absence of cGMP) solely to the NO-bound active species (NR* in Fig. 2B). However, inhibition was still observed under conditions of low GC activity (31Lee Y.C. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), a result we have confirmed using a low NO concentration (0.1 nm). 5E. J. Halvey and J. Garthwaite, unpublished observation. Thus, pyrophosphate must be able to inhibit through an additional mechanism, most likely by binding to the same residues in the inactive receptor. By ana"
https://openalex.org/W2027024350,"Many predators display two foraging modes, an ambush strategy and a cruising mode. These foraging strategies have been classically studied in energetic, biomechanical and ecological terms, without considering the role of signals produced by predators and perceived by prey. Wolf spiders are a typical example; they hunt in leaf litter either using an ambush strategy or by moving at high speed, taking over unwary prey. Air flow upstream of running spiders is a source of information for escaping prey, such as crickets and cockroaches. However, air displacement by running arthropods has not been previously examined. Here we show, using digital particle image velocimetry, that running spiders are highly conspicuous aerodynamically, due to substantial air displacement detectable up to several centimetres in front of them. This study explains the bimodal distribution of spider's foraging modes in terms of sensory ecology and is consistent with the escape distances and speeds of cricket prey. These findings may be relevant to the large and diverse array of arthropod prey-predator interactions in leaf litter."
https://openalex.org/W2035741676,"Background Commentators have expressed concern regarding the existence of proper ethics review systems in developing countries. Our aim is to explore the extent with which investigators from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) Region consider several ethical practices in the conduct of their research. Methodology/Principal Findings Investigators from 12 countries in the EM region submitted 143 proposals involving Public Health and Biotechnology & Genomics to a grant scheme funded by the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office of the WHO and the Organization of Islamic Conference Standing Committee for Science and Technological Cooperation in 2006. The grant application included a 1-page questionnaire that asked investigators 1) whether ethical clearance was obtained, 2) whether they plan to obtain informed consent, and 3) whether confidentiality of human subject data would be ensured. The methodologies of the submitted researches were categorized as to whether it involved 1) human subject research (e.g., the prospective collection of biological specimens or the performance of qualitative research), 2) research that could be exempt from ongoing ethics review, and 3) research not involving human subjects. A descriptive analysis was used to analyze the investigators' responses and a chi-square analysis was used to analyze categorical variables. Of the 79 submitted proposals determined to involve “human subjects”, ethical clearance was not obtained in 29%; investigators thought that informed consent was not needed in 29%; and investigators did not mention that they would ensure confidentiality of the obtained data in 8% of the studies. The magnitude of these deficiencies was similar regardless of study design type, i.e., prospective collection of biological samples and qualitative research methods. Conclusion/Significance These results suggest that attention to ethical safeguards is not optimal among investigators in the EM Region. Further guidelines for strengthening ethical review systems, as well as enhanced educational training in concepts of research ethics for investigators are warranted in this region."

Using both Jurkat T and EA.hy926 endothelial cells as well as site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the ability of alpha4beta1 integrins to recognize the trimeric EMILIN1 gC1q domain mainly depends on a single glutamic acid residue (Glu(933)). Static and flow adhesion of T cells and haptotactic migration of endothelial cells on gC1q is fully dependent on this residue. Thus, EMILIN1 gC1q-alpha4beta1 represents a unique ligand/receptor system, with a requirement for a 3-fold arrangement of the interaction site."
https://openalex.org/W1987332164,"Lysosomes are essential organelles for intracellular degradation and are generally sequestered near the cell center to receive vesicles with contents targeted for destruction. During ascorbic acid (AA)-induced differentiation of osteogenic cells (Beck, G. R., Jr., Zerler, B., and Moran, E. (2001) Cell Growth Differ. 12, 61-83), we saw a marked increase in total lysosome organelles in osteoblastic cells, in addition to an enhanced endocytic rate. Interestingly, lysosomes were dispersed toward the cell periphery in differentiating osteoblasts. We determined that lysosome dispersion in differentiated osteoblasts required intact microtubules for long range transport and was dependent on kinesin motors but did not involve cytosolic acidification. Impairment of lysosome dispersion markedly reduced AA-induced osteoblast differentiation. Lysosomes were not secreted in differentiated osteoblasts, implicating them instead in intracellular degradation. We assayed the degradative capacity and saw a significant increase in DQ-ovalbumin fluorescence in differentiated osteogenic cells compared with undifferentiated control cells. Osteogenic cells are specialized for type I collagen production, and we noted enhanced secreted and intracellular collagen in AA-differentiated osteoblasts versus control cells. Importantly, osteoblasts displayed procollagen-containing vesicles that were distributed throughout the cytoplasm, a portion of which colocalized with lysosomes. Treatment of cells with 2,2′-dipyridyl to inhibit procollagen trimerization enhanced colocalization of lysosomes with procollagen-containing organelles, implicating dispersed lysosomes in collagen processing in osteogenic cells.

Proper organelle positioning is essential in all eukaryotic cells for inter-organelle trafficking, protein targeting, cellular homeostasis, and response to extracellular stimuli (2Wada M. Suetsugu N. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The intracellular organellar architecture is dictated by the protein scaffold of the cell, namely the cytoskeleton. The major cytoskeletal component that dictates the final location of organelles is the microtubule (MT) 3The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; AA, ascorbic acid; LAMP1, lysosomal associated membrane protein 1; RILP, Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceintetrakis (acetoxymethyl) ester; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EEA1, early endosomal antigen-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. cytoskeleton (3Cole N.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), with intermediate filaments also playing a role for certain organelles (4Carmo-Fonseca M. David-Ferreira J.F. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1990; 3: 115-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MTs are long polarized polymers that interact indirectly with organelles through motor and adaptor proteins (5Caviston J.P. Holzbaur E.L.F. Trends Cell Biol. Membr. Dyn. 2006; 16: 530-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The relative abundance and/or activity of motor proteins on the organelles is believed to determine whether the organelle will be positioned in the cell center (toward the MT minus ends) or toward the plasma membrane (at MT plus ends). Organelles, such as mitochondria and melanosomes, are held toward the cell periphery through the actions of the kinesin motor (6Rodionov V.I. Gyoeva F.K. Tanaka E. Bershadsky A.D. Vasiliev J.M. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Rodionov V. Gyoeva F. Gelfand V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas the minus end-directed motor, dynein, is responsible for holding the nucleus, Golgi complex, lysosomes, and recycling endosomes within the cell interior (8Lin S. Collins C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 125-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although most eukaryotic cells have a similar spatial organization of organelles, there are cell-specific differences in organelle quantities and positioning. The relative abundance of organelles can vary from cell to cell as required for cell specializations. For instance, changes in the amount and morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria occur during development, suggesting that the amount and structure of these organelles are both temporally and spatially regulated (9Cech S. Sedlackova M. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 230: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In certain circumstances, organelle positioning and abundance can change within the same cell in response to receptor signaling events. Reorganization of the Golgi occurs during cell migration and phagocytosis as well as during the course of muscle cell differentiation in vitro (10Lu Z. Joseph D. Bugnard E. Zaal K.J.M. Ralston E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Eng E.W. Bettio A. Ibrahim J. Harrison R.E. Mol. Biol.

In the majority of eukaryotic cells, lysosomes are situated near the cell center. The molecular mechanism that clusters lysosomes around the nucleus has been elegantly described. Specifically, the presence of the small GTPase Rab7 on late endosomes/lysosomes recruits an effector, Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), that mobilizes dynein on lysosomal membranes to induce translocation of these organelles to a perinuclear location (13Jordens I. Fernandez-Borja M. Marsman M. Dusseljee S. Janssen L. Calafat J. Janssen H. Wubbolts R. Neefjes J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1680-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 14Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Lysosomes are the penultimate organelle in the endocytic pathway and the central site for intracellular degradation in eukaryotic cells (15Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysosomes also participate in the heterophagy of phagosomal components and can degrade intracellular proteins and cytoplasmic organelles through a process known as autophagy (16Luzio, J. P., Pryor, P. R., and Bright, N. A. (2007) 8, 622-632Google Scholar). Recently, attention has turned toward the role of lysosomes in mediating degradation of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates, notably within neurological disorders (17Martinez-Vicente M. Cuervo A.M. Lancet Neurol. 2007; 6: 352-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization stages are characterized by dramatic changes in both gene expression and cellular architecture (1Beck Jr., G.R. Zerler B. Moran E. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 61-83PubMed Google Scholar, 18Billiard J. Moran R.A. Whitley M.Z. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Gillis K. Brown E.L. Komm B.S. Bodine P.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite recent advances in the understanding of functional aspects of osteoblast differentiation, particularly how proteins are deposited and mineralized, there has been little reported on the intracellular changes that underlie osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we investigated organelle distribution in osteoblasts during differentiation. We observed a dramatic redistribution of lysosomes following 5 days of ascorbic acid (AA) treatment. We employed multiple fluorescent technologies, including confocal, epifluorescence, and total internal reflection fluorescent (TIRF) microscopy to delineate the mechanism of lysosome dispersion and its function during osteoblast differentiation. A clear understanding of intracellular vesicle trafficking in osteogenic cells is essential to resolve the cellular defects underlying bone-wasting disorders. Reagents and Antibodies—Fetal bovine serum and RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm HEPES (HPMI) were purchased from Wisent Inc. α-Minimal essential medium without ascorbic acid, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Alexa Fluor 555 dye, Alexa Fluor 546 transferrin, DQ-ovalbumin, Alexa Fluor 488 dextran, tetramethylrhodamine-dextran, and 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceintetrakis (acetoxymethyl) ester (BCECF-AM) were from Invitrogen. FuGENE-6 was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Antibodies were obtained as follows. Rat polyclonal antibody (ID4B) against lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and anti-kinesin blocking antibody (SUK4) were from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Anti-early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1) (N-19) goat polyclonal IgG antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), cathepsin D mouse polyclonal antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody was from Sigma. Type I collagen antibodies that recognized procollagen and secreted forms were obtained from Jaro Sodek (University of Toronto). All fluorescently labeled and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The Pierce chemiluminescence kit was obtained from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Osteoblast Treatments—MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 was obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cell line was routinely cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Primary osteoblasts from mouse calvaria were isolated from 2-4-day-old CD1 mice pups based on described techniques (19Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Antosz M.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 20Salim A. Nacamuli R.P. Morgan E.F. Giaccia A.J. Longaker M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40007-40016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 5 days in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 1 × 10-9 m prostaglandin E2, 1 × 10-8 m dexamethasone, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (100 μg/ml penicillin plus 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). For differentiation, MC3T3-E1 and CD1 primary osteoblasts were grown with 50 μg/ml AA added to medium. Other substances used to differentiate MC3T3-E1 cells were 1 μm statin (21Maeda T. Matsunuma A. Kurahashi I. Yanagawa T. Yoshida H. Horiuchi N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 458-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and 20 μm myricetin (22Hsu Y.-L. Chang J.-K. Tsai C.-H. Chien T.-T.C. Kuo P.-L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected using the FuGENE-6 protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA constructs used were LAMP1-GFP, RILP-GFP, monomeric red tubulin, and KIF3A-DN-GFP. For cytoskeleton analysis, control and 5-day AA-differentiated osteoblasts were treated with 10 μm nocodazole, 20 μm taxol, and 20 μm cytochalasin D for 30 min. To inhibit procollagen peptide hydroxylation, control and AA-treated MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated with 0.3 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl for 1 h. For microinjection experiments, AA-treated MC3T3-E1 cells plated on 25-mm round coverslips were transferred to a stainless steel chamber, bathed in HPMI medium, and mounted on an inverted microscope stage. A 1:1 mixture of monoclonal anti-kinesin SUK4 antibody (4.3 mg/ml) and Alexa Fluor 555 dye in microinjection buffer was microinjected into MC3T3-E1 cells at room temperature using FemtoJet 5247 V1.06, Inject-Man NI 2, and sterile Femtotips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were allowed to recover in a humidified 37 °C CO2 incubator in media for 2 h prior to analysis. Immunostaining and Picrosirius Red Staining—Control and AA-treated MC3T3-E1 and primary osteoblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 100 mm glycine for another 20 min at room temperature. They were then blocked in 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature prior to staining with primary antibodies (anti-α-tubulin (1:10,000), anti-LAMP1 ID4B (1:4), anti-type I collagen (1:50), and EEA1 antibody (1:50)) for 1 h. Cells were subsequently washed and incubated with compatible fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) and/or phalloidin (1:500) for detection. The cells were then incubated in PBS with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:10,000) for 10 min for nuclear staining. Images were taken using an inverted Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with differential interference contrast and epifluorescence optics along with Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc.) and postprocessed using Axiovision and Adobe Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems, Inc.). Whole neonatal mouse calvarial bones, partially cleaned by gently teasing away surrounding soft tissues, were also immunostained using a standard immunostaining protocol, except that the incubation times for permeabilization, blocking, and primary and secondary antibodies were increased to 1 h, 2 h, overnight, and 1 h, respectively. The calvariae were stained with anti-LAMP1 antibodies and phalloiden and mounted onto a coverslip, and confocal Z-stacks were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Picrosirius Red staining was performed as previously described (23Tullberg-Reinert H. Jundt G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Collagen secretion in differentiated (50 μg/ml of AA) and control undifferentiated MC3T3-E1 cells was analyzed after 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days in culture. Cells were fixed with Bouin's fluid for 1 h and stained with 100 mg/ml Sirius red dye in saturated aqueous picric acid for 1 h with mild shaking and washed thoroughly with 0.01 n hydrochloric acid to remove any nonspecific staining. The slides were then mounted on glass slides and viewed under a bright field Zeiss microscope with a color AxioCam HRm camera. Images were taken with a ×40 oil immersion objective. Determination of Perinuclear Belt of Clustered Lysosomes for Quantification—For lysosome dispersion, we first established a “perinuclear belt” of fixed and defined dimensions in control (undifferentiated) osteoblasts and then counted the total number of lysosomes outside the belt. Initially, to establish the perinuclear belt, we examined TIF images of LAMP1 immunostaining from 50 randomly selected undifferentiated cells (with perinuclear clustered lysosomes) and measured the area around the nucleus that contained the majority of the lysosomes. This region was determined to be an almost circular area around the typically oval-shaped nucleus with a small radius equal to 0.5R (R being the largest radius of the oval cell nucleus) and a big radius equal to 1.3r (r being the small radius of the cell nucleus). Nuclei were identified by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Once this perinuclear belt size was determined, it was used for all subsequent quantification of lysosomes in control and differentiated osteoblasts. The number of lysosomes residing outside the lysosome belt was counted using ImageJ, a Java-based image-processing package from the National Institutes of Health. Experimental Manipulation of Cytosolic pH—Low confluence osteoblasts were grown on 25-mm coverslips in control or differentiation medium for 5 days. They were then washed in regular Ringer's solution, pH 7.4 (155 mm NaCl, 5 mm KC1, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm, MgCI2, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 5 or 10 mm glucose, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and incubated in either prewarmed alkalinized Ringer's solution, pH 7.9 (NH4Cl (10-30 mm) in normal bicarbonate-free Ringer's), or acetate Ringer's solution, pH 6.7 (80 mm NaCl, 70 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaC12, 1 mm MgC12, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.9, 5 or 10 mm glucose), in a 37 °C incubator for 15 min (24Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, blocked, and immunostained for LAMP1 as described above and imaged using epifluorescence microscopy. Measurements of Intracellular pH in Osteoblasts—Low confluence MC3T3-E1 cells were grown on 25-mm glass coverslips for 5 days in control and differentiating media containing 50 μg/ml AA. Measurements of intracellular pH were done according to established methodology using a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye (25Green J. Yamaguchi D.T. Kleeman C.R. Muallem S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A stock solution of the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF-AM at a final concentration of 1 mmol/liter was prepared in DMSO. The osteoblast cells were washed with PBS and incubated in prewarmed isotonic Na+ solution (130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 2 μm BCECF-AM for 20 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with isotonic Na+ solution and mounted on a prewarmed heating stage at 37 °C of a Nikon TMD-Diaphot microscope equipped with a Nikon Fluor oil immersion objective and Hoffman modulation optics with a thermostated Leiden holder. A chopping mirror was used to direct the excitation light alternately to two excitation filters (490BP10 and 440BP10) in front of a xenon lamp. For each coverslip, current measurements over an interval of 60 s were recorded. To minimize dye bleaching and photodynamic damage, neutral density filters were used to reduce the intensity of the excitation light reaching the cells. The excitation light was directed to the cells via a 510-nm dichroic mirror, and fluorescence emission was collected through a 535BP25 filter. Photometric data were acquired at 10 Hz using Oscar software (Photon Technologies Inc.). To determine the cytosolic pH, cells were then incubated in isotonic K+ solutions (143 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES) with known pH gradients of 7.63, 7.35, 6.88, and 6.51 plus 10 μg/ml nigericin. To measure cell pH, a 490:425 ratio signified as y was plotted against the known pH gradient. The linear plot with an equation of y = mx + b was used to calculate the averaged cell intracellular pH signified as x. Quantification of Endocytosis and Lysosomes in Osteoblasts—To label endosomes, control and AA-treated osteoblasts were serum-starved for 1 h. The cells were then incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 546 transferrin for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with cold 1× PBS, pH 4.5, to remove surface-associated Alexa Fluor 546 transferrin. The cells were then washed with regular cold 1× PBS and fixed for quantification. Total lysosome count was tabulated from control and AA-treated cells, which were immunostained with LAMP1. Lysosome number and transferrin uptake were quantified from TIF images of 20 cells for each experiment for three replicate trials. ImageJ was used to quantitate pixels corresponding to total EEA1/LAMP1 in control and AA-differentiated MC3T3-E1 and primary osteoblasts. The cell boundary was established from differential interference contrast images. To determine the levels of endocytosis, control and AA-treated osteoblasts were fixed and immunostained with EEA1 antibody. To analyze catalytic degradation in lysosomes in osteoblasts, glass coverslips or 96-well plates were coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine for 1 h and 2 μl of 1 mg/ml DQ-ovalbumin and allowed to air dry. Primary and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts (with and without 50 μg/ml AA for 5 days) were trypsinized, and equal cell numbers were seeded in the wells (70% confluence) and incubated overnight. The fluorescence emission in fluorescence intensity units was measured by means of ELISA using a FLUOstar OPTIMA luminescence microplate reader with an excitation filter of 485 nm and emission filter of 520 nm. Each value of fluorescence intensity represented a mean value obtained from three independent experiments. To examine the colocalization of degraded DQ-ovalbumin with lysosomes, cells were pulsed with 50 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine-dextran for 2 h, prior to overnight plating on DQ-ovalbumin-coated coverslips. The following day, epifluorescent images of live cells were captured using epifluorescence microscopy. The weighted colocalization coefficient, the sum of intensities of colocalizing pixels relative to the overall sum of pixel intensities above the threshold (or background), was used in confocal slices of untreated and treated MC3T3-E1 cells to determine the relative levels of LAMP1-positive collagen vesicles. The advantage of a weighted colocalization coefficient is that differences in pixel intensity are taken into account (i.e. not all pixels contribute equally to the final colocalization coefficient value). In this regard, collagen vesicles showing a weighted coefficient greater than or equal to 0.3 with LAMP1 were scored as positive within each cell/treatment. TIRF Imaging of Lysosomes—For TIRF imaging of live cells, control and AA-differentiated osteoblasts were grown on 25-mm round glass coverslips for 5 days. On the 4th day, cells were pulsed with 50 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488 dextran for 2 h. Subsequent washes with PBS were performed to remove extracellular residues of dextran. The dextran tracer was chased overnight to late endosomes or lysosomes (26Harrison R.E. Bucci C. Vieira O.V. Schroer T.A. Grinstein S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6494-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated for secretion with 10 μm of ionomycin in a 2 mm calcium buffer for 5 min during imaging. MC3T3-E1 and primary osteoblast cells were imaged using TIRF with an α-Plan-Fluor ×100/1.45 objective, a 488-nm excitation filter, and a 100-milliwatt multilane argon-ion laser and TIRF slider (Zeiss). Images were acquired every second for up to 5 min. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of collagen type I and cathepsin D secreted from control and AA-treated MC3T3-E1 cells, Western immunoblotting was performed on the cell lysate and conditioned media from the cell cultures at day 5 of incubation. Protein was isolated by solubilizing the samples in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 2 μg/ml phosphatases and protease inhibitors. The protein concentration was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 70 μg of protein was boiled in sample buffer consisting of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 60 mm Tris, pH 8.8, and 0.001% bromphenol blue. The proteins were electrophoresed in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. The membranes were blocked in T-TBS (0.1% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) with 5% skim milk powder. After washing in T-TBS, the blots were incubated with anti-collagen antibody (1:1000) or anti-cathepsin D antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed and incubated with anti-sheep or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000), respectively, and positive bands were detected using the Pierce chemiluminescence kit. Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent from MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells. Samples of total RNA (1.5-3 μg) were reverse transcribed, and semiquantitative real time PCR was performed on control, AA-treated, and two RILP-GFP-stable cell populations (27Zhao S. Fernald R.D. J. Comput. Biol. 2005; 12: 1047-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The primers used were as follows: L32-F, 5′-CACAATGTCAAGGAGCTGGAAGT-3′; L32-R, 5′-TCTACAATGGCTTTTCGGTTCT-3′; OCN-F, 5′-CTGACCTCACAGATCCCAAGC-3′; OCN-R, 5′-TGGTCTGATAGCTCGTCACAAG-3′; BSP-F, 5′-CAGGGAGGCAGTGACTCTTC-3′; BSP-R, 5′-AGTGTGGAAAGTGTGGCGTT-3′; ALP-F, 5′CCAACTCTTTTGTGCCAGAGA-3′; ALP-R, 5′-GCTACATTGGTGTTGAGCTTTT-3′; OPN-F, 5′-AGCAAGAAACTCTTCCAAGCAA-3′; OPN-R, 5′-GTGAGATTCGTCAGATTCATCCG-3′; Col1a1-F, 5′-GCTCCTCTTAGGGGCCACT-3′; Col1a1-R, 5′-CCACGTCTCACCATTGGGG-3′. In preliminary experiments, we confirmed linear range of amplification for all primers and products. Real time reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using the MyIQ iCycler system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplimers were quantified in triplicate samples in each of three independent experiments for each gene and normalized to corresponding L32 ribosomal protein values, and these data were then normalized to control untreated cells. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. All experimental data were repeated in at least triplicates, taking into account 20 cells in each treatment (control and AA-treated and drug treatments). To avoid bias in our quantifications, cells from each treatment were randomly picked for imaging, and the resulting images were processed following a “blinded” approach in which the operator was unaware of the sample identity. Statistical comparisons were made by a two-tailed Student's t test. Differences with p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results for PCR analysis were expressed as the mean ± S.E. and analyzed statistically by one-way analysis of variance and a post hoc Bonferroni test. Enhanced Endocytosis and Lysosomes in AA-treated Osteoblasts—AA (reduced vitamin C) has been shown to be essential for the in vitro differentiation of many mesenchyme-derived cell types, including osteoblasts (28Franceschi R.T. Wilson J.X. Dixon S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1430-C1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Undifferentiated osteoblast precursors, following exposure to AA for several days, up-regulate expression of numerous genes that are key for collagen synthesis, the primary role of mature osteogenic cells (29Stains J.P. Civitelli R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 222Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since endocytic organelles had not previously been studied in this cell type, we began our study examining the levels of endocytosis in undifferentiated (control) osteoblast precursors versus osteoblasts that had been differentiated with AA for 5 days. Early endosomes were quantified in fixed cells via immunostaining with an antibody to EEA1. Cells were scored for total EEA1 fluorescence/cell, and AA-treated osteoblasts showed enhanced levels of early endosomes, compared with control cells (Fig. 1A). Uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin was also increased in AA-stimulated cells (not shown), which may reflect AA-mediated up-regulation of transferrin receptors (30Khumalo H. Gomo Z.A. Gangaidzo I.T. Moyo V.M. Mandishona E. Saungweme T. Rouault T.A. Gordeuk V.R. MacPhail A.P. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 1573-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). EEA1 immunostaining revealed enhanced early endosomes in AA-treated osteoblasts. We next investigated the relative abundance of later endocytic compartments, namely lysosomes, during osteoblast differentiation. We quantified the late endocytic compartments by immunostaining control and AA-treated MC3T3-E1 and primary calvarial osteoblast cells with LAMP1, a marker for lysosomes and late endosomes (31Rohrer J.

Fig. 1C shows an epifluorescent image of the LAMP1-positive organelles in control and AA-treated primary osteoblastic cells. Since the osteoblastic cells were extremely flat at this stage, epifluorescence microscopy ably captured the majority of stained organelles in these cells. Quantification of the total fluorescent pixels in TIF images of these cells showed a significant increase in the total number of lysosomes and late endosomes in AA-treated cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, we also noted a striking chan"
https://openalex.org/W2149358259,"Background Myosin VIIA (MyoVIIA) is an unconventional myosin necessary for vertebrate audition [1]–[5]. Human auditory transduction occurs in sensory hair cells with a staircase-like arrangement of apical protrusions called stereocilia. In these hair cells, MyoVIIA maintains stereocilia organization [6]. Severe mutations in the Drosophila MyoVIIA orthologue, crinkled (ck), are semi-lethal [7] and lead to deafness by disrupting antennal auditory organ (Johnston's Organ, JO) organization [8]. ck/MyoVIIA mutations result in apical detachment of auditory transduction units (scolopidia) from the cuticle that transmits antennal vibrations as mechanical stimuli to JO. Principal Findings Using flies expressing GFP-tagged NompA, a protein required for auditory organ organization in Drosophila, we examined the role of ck/MyoVIIA in JO development and maintenance through confocal microscopy and extracellular electrophysiology. Here we show that ck/MyoVIIA is necessary early in the developing antenna for initial apical attachment of the scolopidia to the articulating joint. ck/MyoVIIA is also necessary to maintain scolopidial attachment throughout adulthood. Moreover, in the adult JO, ck/MyoVIIA genetically interacts with the non-muscle myosin II (through its regulatory light chain protein and the myosin binding subunit of myosin II phosphatase). Such genetic interactions have not previously been observed in scolopidia. These factors are therefore candidates for modulating MyoVIIA activity in vertebrates. Conclusions Our findings indicate that MyoVIIA plays evolutionarily conserved roles in auditory organ development and maintenance in invertebrates and vertebrates, enhancing our understanding of auditory organ development and function, as well as providing significant clues for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2095298573,"Function prediction frequently relies on comparing genes or gene products to search for relevant similarities. Because the number of protein structures with unknown function is mushrooming, however, we asked here whether such comparisons could be improved by focusing narrowly on the key functional features of protein structures, as defined by the Evolutionary Trace (ET). Therefore a series of algorithms was built to (a) extract local motifs (3D templates) from protein structures based on ET ranking of residue importance; (b) to assess their geometric and evolutionary similarity to other structures; and (c) to transfer enzyme annotation whenever a plurality was reached across matches. Whereas a prototype had only been 80% accurate and was not scalable, here a speedy new matching algorithm enabled large-scale searches for reciprocal matches and thus raised annotation specificity to 100% in both positive and negative controls of 49 enzymes and 50 non-enzymes, respectively-in one case even identifying an annotation error-while maintaining sensitivity ( approximately 60%). Critically, this Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) pipeline requires no prior knowledge of functional mechanisms. It could thus be applied in a large-scale retrospective study of 1218 structural genomics enzymes and reached 92% accuracy. Likewise, it was applied to all 2935 unannotated structural genomics proteins and predicted enzymatic functions in 320 cases: 258 on first pass and 62 more on second pass. Controls and initial analyses suggest that these predictions are reliable. Thus the large-scale evolutionary integration of sequence-structure-function data, here through reciprocal identification of local, functionally important structural features, may contribute significantly to de-orphaning the structural proteome."

Multiple recent papers describe longer-term outcomes in these patients, and two additional studies offer novel approaches that may lead to autologous sources of transplantable dopamine neurons. Early clinical trials designed to treat Parkinson's disease by transplantation of fetal tissue containing dopamine neuron precursors yielded promising results, but the approach retains several limitations. Multiple recent papers describe longer-term outcomes in these patients, and two additional studies offer novel approaches that may lead to autologous sources of transplantable dopamine neurons. The first clinical trials that used dopamine neuron replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) were carried out in Sweden almost 20 years ago by transplanting aborted fetal brain tissue into the brains of PD patients (Lindvall et al., 1990Lindvall O. Brundin P. Widner H. Rehncrona S. Gustavii B. Frackowiak R. Leenders K.L. Sawle G. Rothwell J.C. Marsden C.D. Science. 1990; 247: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the transferred tissue harbored immature dopamine neurons that integrated into the striatum, produced dopamine, and in some cases were able to replace drug treatments. However, initial optimism faded when subsequent double-blind trials revealed less substantial effects and a few patients developed dyskinesias, or abnormal movements (Olanow et al., 2003Olanow C.W. Goetz C.G. Kordower J.H. Stoessl A.J. Sossi V. Brin M.F. Shannon K.M. Nauert G.M. Perl D.P. Godbold J. Freeman T.B. Ann.

Trojanowski J.Q. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 710-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). Today, only a few clinical trials are still ongoing as the field holds its breath and waits for the answers to many technical questions. Is there an alternative to using fetal tissue? Will the transplanted cells always be susceptible to rejection? Will grafts succumb to the disease process that killed the endogenous dopamine neurons? Can troublesome dyskinesias be avoided? Can dopamine neuron transplants really provide a cure in a complex disease like PD? Five new papers address some of these issues and are the focus of this article. The use of fetal tissue as a cell source for clinical transplantation is not very practical, as developing dopamine neurons are rare and only available from exactly 8-week-old embryos. Cells from younger donors will not be patterned correctly, and older cells will not survive. In the early 1990s, researchers began to ask whether stem cells might offer an alternative. It quickly became evident that, while human cells isolated from the fetal tissue used in clinical transplantation studies could be expanded in culture and survive transplantation into rodent models of PD, they failed to generate significant numbers of dopamine neurons when compared to primary tissues (Svendsen et al., 1996Svendsen C.N. Clarke D.J. Rosser A.E. Dunnett S.B. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 137: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In a seminal publication by McKay and colleagues, this problem was overcome by using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a starting source. Unlike their fetal counterparts, ESCs produce large numbers of functional dopamine neurons that, when transplanted, can restore function in rodent models of PD (Kim et al., 2002Kim J.H. Auerbach J.M. Rodriguez-Gomez J.A. Velasco I. Gavin D. Lumelsky N. Lee S.H. Nguyen J. Sanchez-Pernaute R. Bankiewicz K. McKay R. Nature. 2002; 418: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). This exciting work on ESCs has now been extended in two important ways. First, Studer and colleagues derived murine embryos via nuclear transfer using donor fibroblasts isolated from mice with experimentally induced PD (Tabar et al., 2008Tabar V. Tomishima M. Panagiotakos G. Wakayama S. Menon J. Chan B. Mizutani E. Al-Shamy G. Ohta H. Wakayama T. Studer L. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The resulting blastocysts were used to generate ESCs, which were differentiated into dopamine neurons and transplanted back into the original fibroblast donor mice. Importantly, this study observed improved graft survival and functional recovery when autologous ntESCs were transplanted, suggesting that using exactly matched cells may reduce immune rejection. In an independent, but related, study, Jaenisch and colleagues bypassed the need for nuclear transfer with induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived by the enforced expression of four transcription factors in adult fibroblasts (Yamanaka, 2007Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Existing murine iPS cell lines were differentiated into neural lineages and then dopamine neurons by using established techniques (Wernig et al., 2008Wernig M. Zhao J.P. Pruszak J. Hedlund E. Fu D. Soldner F. Broccoli V. Constantine-Paton M. Isacson O. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5856-5861Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The resulting cells were subsequently transplanted into a rat model of PD, where they elicited functional improvement. In both of these proof-of-principle studies, the authors conclude that dopamine neurons produced from either cloned mouse embryos or reprogrammed skin cells are able to functionally integrate into the brain and release dopamine—perhaps the best obtainable evidence that neurons derived using these methods can mature appropriately. Of course, translating these exciting mouse studies to human PD patients is the next challenge. Certainly, the opportunity to use autologous cells to generate dopamine neurons is appealing, as it would yield transplants with very low rejection levels. Indeed, while human ESC lines have not yet been established by using nuclear transfer techniques, recent observations that iPS cells can be generated from human fibroblasts is encouraging (reviewed in Jaenisch and Young, 2008Jaenisch R. Young R. Cell. 2008; 132: 567-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). However, the logistical challenge of having to produce individual, patient-specific cell lines is daunting, particularly in the case of nuclear transfer, given the number of egg donors that would be required. Furthermore, to date, iPS cell derivation requires the insertion of multiple genes and, when combined with the poorly understood genomic alterations associated with reprogramming, raises important safety issues. Finally, while many PD patients do not bear known mutations for PD, they may still exhibit novel, unidentified susceptibility gene profiles. Thus, an autologous transplant might be at risk of an accelerated course of pathological changes relative to cells from a healthy donor. Beyond the question of the source of dopamine neurons for transplantation, two additional reports of patients receiving fetal tissue grafts address the long-term potential of this therapy paradigm. The studies reveal that some of the surviving dopamine neurons exhibit pathological changes associated with PD (Li et al., 2008Li J.Y. Englund E. Holton J.L. Soulet D. Hagell P. Lees A.J. Lashley T. Quinn N.P. Rehncrona S. Bjorklund A. et al.Nat. Med. 2008; (Published online April 6, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1746Crossref Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, Kordower et al., 2008Kordower J.H. Chu Y. Hauser R.A. Freeman T.B. Olanow C.W. Nat. Med. 2008; (Published online April 6, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). This raises the fascinating possibility that the aging, diseased environment transmits a toxic signal to the grafted neurons, in which case transplanted cells from any source would be equally threatened. However, while these results demonstrate that grafted cells can exhibit PD pathology, only a few neurons appear to be affected. In addition, a third study of other grafted PD patients did not observe any pathology in the transplanted dopamine neurons (Mendez et al., 2008Mendez I. Vinuela A. Astradsson A. Mukhida K. Hallett P. Robertson H. Tierney T. Holness R. Dagher A. Trojanowski J.Q. Isacson O. Nat. Med. 2008; (Published online April 6, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Overall, while the recent human studies offer insight into the potential spread of PD pathology, the jury is still out on the relevance of a few aberrant neurons to this therapeutic approach. Together, it seems that these five studies leave us with an added appreciation for the remaining hurdles that face dopamine neuron replacement therapies for PD. Stem cells certainly offer an ideal source of dopamine neurons, and these latest studies imply that autologous cells may one day be available for transplant therapies, provided the diseased host environment does not prevent their function. But perhaps the taller hurdles lie ahead. The mechanisms underlying dyskinesias that appear in some transplant patients must be elucidated to increase safety. Stem cells may be used to tackle this problem as well, if more defined dopamine populations can be produced, or engineered by using inducible promoters to control dopamine release. In this way, the patient could take a drug to activate dopamine production for better control of neuronal activity. The next hurdle is higher still. Most current transplant strategies for PD deposit the cells ectopically in the striatum, a forebrain structure. While convenient for dopamine neurons to connect to their target, the location of the endogenous, damaged dopamine neurons is buried deep in the midbrain, many centimeters away. In order to restore the original circuit, dopamine neurons must be engrafted back into the midbrain and then undergo long-distance axon regeneration to targets in the striatum. If possible, this approach has the potential to restore physiologically relevant input to the new dopamine neurons and perhaps provide the normal fine control over dopamine release that characterizes this system. However, extensive long-distance axonal outgrowth into the adult brain has been difficult to achieve in other studies. The final hurdle facing dopamine neuron replacement strategies is that PD pathology is not restricted to the loss of dopamine neurons. Many other systems degenerate in PD patients and may need to be addressed in addition to re-establishing dopamine signals in the brain. But dopamine replacement may be only part of the story. Stem cells can also produce astrocytes, which are able to modulate synaptic transmission, toxic glutamate levels, and the blood-brain barrier function. They can also be genetically modified to release powerful drugs within specific brain regions. So, while cures based on dopamine neuron transplantation may not be around the corner, stem cells offer many new potential avenues of therapy for PD patients that may compliment current treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2012808493,"Background High doses of pooled polyclonal IgG are commonly used to treat numerous autoimmune diseases. Their mode of action nevertheless remains only partially explained. At the same time, until now, no early biological marker has been able to predict their efficacy. Methodology/Principal Findings In a first pilot retrospective analysis, we reviewed white blood cell counts and blood smears in consecutive patients with autoimmune disease (n = 202) and non-autoimmune disease (n = 104). Autoimmune patients received either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg, n = 103), plasma exchange (n = 78) or no specific treatment (n = 21). We then prospectively monitored consecutive autoimmune patients with IVIg injection (n = 67), or without any specific treatment (n = 10) using the same routine laboratory tests, as well as flow cytometry. Both retrospective and prospective analyses identified large plasma-cell mobilization exclusively in IVIg-treated autoimmune patients 7 days after initiation of treatment. The majority of IVIg-mobilized plasma cells were immature HLA-DRhigh/CD138low/CXCR4low plasma cells expressing intracellular immunoglobulin G which were neither IVIg- nor human IgG-specific. Importantly, we found a strong negative correlation between the absolute number of IVIg-mobilized plasma cells and time to improve neurological function in both retrospective and prospective studies of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), (r = −0.52, p = 0.0031, n = 30, r = −0.47, p = 0.0028, n = 40, respectively). Conclusions/Significance IVIg promotes immature plasma-cell mobilization in patients with GBS, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, myasthenia gravis and inflammatory myopathy. Prominent day 7 plasma-cell mobilization is a favourable prognostic marker in patients with GBS receiving IVIg treatment."

Fresh embryos resulting from in vitro fertilization, including many of poor quality, can provide sources of human embryonic stem cell lines. We consider why some donate such embryos for this research, address relevant ethical and policy issues, and present core guidelines for fresh embryo donation based on those of Canada. Stem cell investigators have sought to augment the availability and diversity of the pool of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines ever since the initial generation and culture of such lines from human embryos in 1998 (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11509) Google Scholar). They have developed new hESC lines on feeder cells not subject to contamination by animal viruses in order to avoid possible transmission of animal pathogens to patients through transplanted hESCs or their progeny (Amit et al., 2003Amit M. Margulets V. Segev H. Shariki K. Laevsky I. Coleman R. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 2150-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). They have also generated new hESC lines that express more diverse histocompatibility antigens than those currently available so as to have sufficient lines stored to match most patients genetically (Taylor et al., 2005Taylor C.J. Bolton E.M. Pocock S. Sharples L.D. Pedersen R.A. Bradley J.A. Lancet. 2005; 366: 2019-2025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Moreover, they have derived additional hESC lines to address the finding that hESCs accumulate genetic and epigenetic alterations as they are passaged, raising long-term concerns about their suitability for therapeutic use (Maitra et al., 2005Maitra A. Arking D.E. Shivapurkar N. Ikeda M. Stastny V. Kassaue K. Sui G. Cutler D.J. Liu Y. Brimble S.N. et al.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The derivation of new hESC lines from embryos known or likely to carry mutations provides investigators with an opportunity to create research models of many human genetic diseases that could also be employed for screening new drugs (Pickering et al., 2005Pickering S.J. Minger S.L. Patel M. Taylor H. Black C. Burns C.J. Ekonoumou A. Braude P.R. Reprod. Biomed.

Different hESC lines have a range of properties that make some especially useful for particular research purposes, while confident generalizations require experiments on multiple lines. The recent development of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from differentiated human somatic cells (e.g., Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13487) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2008Park I.H. Zhao R. West J.A. Yabuuchi A. Huo H. Ince T.A. Lerou P.H. Lensch M.W. Daley G.Q. Nature. 2008; 451: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar) has not obviated the need for additional hESC lines for research (Hyun et al., 2007Hyun I. Hochedlinger K. Jaenisch R. Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 367-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The random insertion of multiple transgenes, including oncogenes in some instances, into the genome via the sort of retroviral integration that somatic cell reprogramming currently requires may mutate endogenous genes in unpredictable, cell line-specific ways, making it questionable whether the resulting iPS lines can be safely used for clinical purposes (Hyun et al., 2007Hyun I. Hochedlinger K. Jaenisch R. Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 367-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Uncertainty remains about what cell types can be transformed to iPS cells, how pluripotent or tumorigenic the human iPS cell lines are, and whether they are sufficiently proliferative and stable to be useful for therapeutic purposes (Pera, 2008Pera M.F. Nature. 2008; 451: 135-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Developmental biologists depend on hESCs to perform experimental investigations of early embryonic development that may not be possible using iPS cells. Moreover, epigenetic changes that occur during early embryonic development can be recapitulated as hESCs differentiate, but may not even occur in iPS cell lines (e.g., Eiges et al., 2007Eiges R. Urbach A. Malcov M. Frumkin T. Schwarz T. Amit A. Yaron Y. Eden A. Yanuka O. Benvenisty N. Ben-Yosef D. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 568-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For such reasons, research on hESC lines, including new lines, will not be displaced by that on iPS lines in the foreseeable future and remains important for ongoing stem cell research and the development of potential therapies. Fresh embryos have provided a source of hESC lines ever since the inception of hESC research (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11509) Google Scholar). The use of surplus fresh embryos from assisted reproduction technology (ART) clinics for the production of such lines, however, has recently been called into question. At issue is whether fresh embryos provide a useful source of hESC lines, whether donors of surplus fresh embryos have sufficient time to provide an informed consent to such donation, whether it is in the interests of women to forgo freezing such embryos, and whether patients might be pressured into donating surplus fresh embryos by reproductive specialists. Here we address the ethical and policy issues related to the use of fresh human embryos for hESC research, including those of subclinical quality, in excess of patient need derived during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. The major source of new hESC lines internationally has been surplus embryos in excess of clinical need donated by those who have completed an IVF cycle. With controlled ovarian stimulation, more embryos can be generated in one IVF cycle than can be safely transferred without increasing the risks posed to patients and future children (Hoffman et al., 2003Hoffman D.I. Zellman G.L. Fair C.C. Mayer J.F. Zeitz J.G. Gibbons W.E. Turner Jr., T.G. Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and RANDFertil. Steril. 2003; 79: 1063-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In order to reduce these risks, assisted reproduction oversight bodies and professional societies in several countries require or recommend that a limited number of embryos be transferred for implantation in any one IVF cycle (e.g., United Kingdom, Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, 2007United Kingdom, Human Fertilisation and Embryology AuthorityCode of Practice.Seventh Edition. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, London2007Google Scholar; Ministry of Health, Singapore). As a result, some couples and individuals have surplus embryos remaining after the completion of an IVF cycle. Some among them choose to donate these embryos for hESC research. Fresh, as well as frozen, embryos have been included in the cohort of donated embryos. Fresh embryos were among the embryos from which Thomson and colleagues derived the first hESC lines (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11509) Google Scholar) and were also the source of several other lines approved for federally funded research in the United States (see National Institutes of Health). A recent report from the United Kingdom indicates that fresh embryos constitute the preponderance of embryos used for hESC research in that country (Chris O'Toole, Presentation to British Medical Research Council, November 27, 2007). Stem cell lines have also been derived from fresh embryos by investigators in several other countries, including Australia (cell lines initiated in Singapore), Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Recently, the question of whether to allow the donation and use of fresh embryos for the derivation of new hESC lines has been raised in several countries, including Australia (see Australian Senate), Canada (Nisker and White, 2005Nisker J. White A. CMAJ. 2005; 173: 621-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and Switzerland (Jaconi, Human ESC Research in Switzerland). Debate about this issue has primarily focused on concerns about informed consent, the protection of women's interests, and the prevention of conflicts of interests on the part of reproductive specialists treating patients undergoing IVF. International policy approaches to the donation of fresh embryos for this purpose vary considerably. While some jurisdictions allow the donation and use of fresh embryos for stem cell research (see Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Portuguese Law No. 32/2006; South Korean Bioethics and Biosafety Act; Swedish Genetic Integrity Act; UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act), others have restricted the donation of fresh embryos for such research to those not suitable for implantation (see Australian Legislation; Estonian Legislation). Prohibitions regarding the donation and use of fresh embryos are in force in several jurisdictions. These range from general bans on embryo donation (e.g., German Parliament) to provisions restricting the donation and use of embryos to those that are cryopreserved (e.g., Official Gazette of the Hellenic Republic; Japanese Government). To date, Canada is the only country that has adopted a specific and comprehensive model for oversight of research proposals in which hESC lines are to be derived from either surplus fresh or frozen embryos. The Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Guidelines of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (see Canadian Institutes of Health Research) are administered and explicated by its Stem Cell Oversight Committee (SCOC). (Five of the authors of this article are current or former members of the SCOC.) These guidelines permit research to study hESC lines derived from human embryos created but no longer required for reproductive purposes, as well as preexisting hESC lines. They offer a model for ethical oversight of research proposals involving the use of surplus fresh embryos remaining after the completion of IVF treatment in hESC research that could be of assistance to stem cell oversight bodies in other countries. It has been proposed that frozen-thawed embryos are superior to their fresh counterparts as a source of hESC lines (Baylis and McInnes, 2007Baylis F. McInnes C. Women at risk: embryonic and fetal stem cell research in Canada.McGill Health Law Publication. 2007; 1: 53-67Google Scholar). This claim is based on a study in which investigators found that frozen-thawed embryos gave rise to hESC lines at a rate 2.6 times higher than when fresh embryos were used (p = 0.09) (Sjögren et al., 2004Sjögren A. Hardason T. Andersson K. Caisander G. Lundquist M. Wikland M. Semb H. Hamberger L. Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2004; 9: 326-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, because the two cohorts used in this study were dissimilar in quality, these data do not demonstrate the superiority of frozen embryos over fresh embryos. When embryos that had progressed to blastocyst stage were used in this study, the difference in rate of production of hESC lines between fresh (lower quality) and frozen-thawed (higher quality) embryos was eliminated. The definitive study needed to determine whether it is technically preferable to use fresh or frozen-thawed embryos to generate hESC lines would involve a controlled comparison of the use of large samples of both fresh and frozen-thawed embryos of similar quality. Such a study has not been reported in the scientific peer-reviewed literature to date. While it is clear from the above that fresh embryos are an adequate source of hESCs, retrospective consideration of the literature suggests that they may offer technical advantages. There is an extensive literature on efforts to reduce the cellular damage caused by freezing and thawing of embryos, with the goal being to achieve IVF pregnancy rates for surviving embryos comparable to that of fresh embryos (Veeck et al., 2004Veeck L.L. Bodine R. Clarke R.N. Berrios R. Libraro J. Moschini R.M. Zaninovic N. Rosenwaks Z. Fertil. Steril. 2004; 82: 1418-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Approximately 35% of frozen embryos do not survive the freeze-thaw process (Hoffman et al., 2003Hoffman D.I. Zellman G.L. Fair C.C. Mayer J.F. Zeitz J.G. Gibbons W.E. Turner Jr., T.G. Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and RANDFertil. Steril. 2003; 79: 1063-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, more embryos would be required to produce each hESC line from frozen-thawed embryos than from fresh embryos if their rates of production per embryo are the same, as indicated by Sjögren et al., 2004Sjögren A.

A substantial rate of success of production of hESC lines has been reported for fresh blastocysts considered clinically unsuitable for ART based on morphological assessment (Lerou et al., 2008Lerou P.H.

Because about half of the embryos produced for ART are of low morphological quality and are normally discarded, hundreds of thousands are thus potentially available for research (Lerou et al., 2008Lerou P.H. Yabuuchi A. Huo H. Takeuchi A. Shea J. Cimini T. Ince T.A. Ginsburg E. Racowsky C. Daley G.Q. Nat.

With the application of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to IVF embryos, some embryos with a healthy appearance will be discarded for genetic reasons. These embryos can provide excellent sources of hESC cell lines that are useful for research on genetic diseases (e.g., Pickering et al., 2005Pickering S.J. Minger S.L. Patel M. Taylor H. Black C. Burns C.J. Ekonoumou A. Braude P.R. Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2005; 10: 390-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The proven utility of fresh embryos—including those deemed qualitatively unsuitable for clinical use at ART clinics—for the derivation of hESCs provides a rationale for developing policies for the ethical use of fresh embryos. A regulatory framework for the use of these embryos, particularly with regard to obtaining consent of donors, is thus required. Although most couples and individuals undergoing ART choose to freeze all of their surplus fresh embryos (Elford et al., 2004Elford K. Lawrence C. Leader A. Fertil. Steril. 2004; 81: 1154-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Bankowski et al., 2005Bankowski B.J. Lyerly A.D. Faden R.R. Wallach E.E. Fertil. Steril. 2005; 84: 823-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), some decide to freeze only some of them. They can choose to discard the remaining fresh embryos or to donate them for hESC research. (Fresh embryos are not usually donated to others unless they are frozen and quarantined for three months to prevent transmission of disease.) Some choose to donate the remaining fresh embryos for hESC research (Choudhary et al., 2004Choudhary M. Haimes E. Herbert M. Stojkovic M. Murdoch A.M. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Others elect not to freeze any of their remaining fresh embryos and instead donate all of them for hESC research (Choudhary et al., 2004Choudhary M. Haimes E. Herbert M. Stojkovic M. Murdoch A.M. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Lysdahl et al., 2006Lysdahl H. Gabrielson A. Minger S.L. Patel M.J. Fink J. Petersen K. Ebbesen P. Zachar V. Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2006; 12: 119-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). They may do so for one or more of the following reasons. Fresh embryos are transferred, in part, on the basis of their quality, which is assessed according to morphological characteristics, cleavage stage, cleavage rates, degree of cytoplasmic fragmentation, and other factors (Baczkowski et al., 2004Baczkowski T. Kurzawa R. Glabowski W. Reprod. Biol. 2004; 4: 5-22PubMed Google Scholar, Sjöblom et al., 2006Sjöblom P. Menezes J. Cummins L. Mathiyalagan B. Costello M.F. Fertil. Steril. 2006; 86: 848-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Priority for transfer is given to embryos that are considered of optimal quality, as their use results in a higher rate of implantation and successful pregnancy. Some couples and individuals with surplus fresh embryos of suboptimal quality decide not to freeze them because it seems unlikely that they could be used successfully in future IVF cycles. Instead of discarding them, they choose to donate them for hESC research. Others are concerned about the possible damaging effects that the freeze-thaw process might have on surplus embryos and therefore on the health of any children who might result from their use in a subsequent IVF cycle (Svanberg et al., 2001Svanberg A.S. Boivin J. Bergh T. Acta Obstet. Gynecol. Scand. 2001; 80: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For this reason, some among them elect not to cryopreserve surplus embryos for future use and, rather than discard them, donate them all for hESC research. Others undergo IVF treatment in order to avoid knowingly passing a serious genetic disease to their children. In these instances, the resulting embryos are screened by means of PGD and only those that do not carry the disease genotype of concern are transferred. The remaining fresh embryos that are not used for reproductive purposes may provide useful sources of hESCs for research models of the relevant genetic diseases (Barratt et al., 2004Barratt C.L. St. John J.C.C. Afnan M. Lancet. 2004; 364: 115-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, Pickering et al., 2005Pickering S.J. Minger S.L. Patel M. Taylor H. Black C.

Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 568-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar; see also Australian Senate). Some couples and individuals decide to donate them for this purpose. Still other couples and individuals elect to forgo freezing surplus fresh embryos for personal reasons and instead donate all of their remaining fresh embryos for hESC research. Some, for instance, believe that they will be too old to have children in the future and therefore refrain from cryopreserving remaining fresh embryos, regardless of their quality (Dickens and Cook, 2007Dickens B.M. Cook R.J. Int. J. Gynaecol. Obstet. 2007; 96: 67-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Some among them elect to donate them for hESC research. Others cannot meet the financial costs of embryo cryopreservation, annual storage, and the thawing and transfer of embryos in future IVF cycles. They therefore cannot freeze any remaining fresh embryos, no matter what their quality, but some donate them for hESC research (Choudhary et al., 2004Choudhary M. Haimes E. Herbert M. Stojkovic M. Murdoch A.M. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The inability of financially disadvantaged IVF patients and their spouses or partners to freeze their surplus fresh embryos raises wider social issues related to equity of access and resource allocation that are beyond the scope of this article. However, it is important to observe that the use of spare fresh embryos donated by those who cannot afford to freeze them does not involve their financial exploitation by those who request their consent for such donation, since the latter have not placed the former in their economic position. These couples and individuals have been offered ART services to address their childlessness, not in order to harvest their fresh embryos for research. Because they are financially constrained, they have a narrower range of disposition options than those who are not, since they cannot freeze their remaining fresh embryos. To deny them another option, the option of donating these fresh embryos to hESC research, and to force them to discard these embryos or donate them to others who could afford to freeze them in order to protect them from putative exploitation by those seeking their consent for the donation of these embryos for research would be stigmatizing and discriminatory. Some decide not to cryopreserve surplus fresh embryos because they oppose embryo freezing on ethical, religious, and/or cultural grounds, although they may not be opposed to hESC research in itself (Choudhary et al., 2004Choudhary M. Haimes E. Herbert M. Stojkovic M. Murdoch A.M. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 2091-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2005Chen H. Qian K. Hu J. Liu D. Lu W. Yang Y. Wang D. Yan H. Zhang S. Zhu G. Hum. Reprod. 2005; 20: 2201-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For instance, within the Islamic tradition, hESC research is allowed (El-Gendy, 2005El-Gendy A.R. “Transplanting and implanting cells of the brain and nervous system” and “The extent of making use of aborted fetuses, surplus zygotes, and anencephalic babies,” in The International Islamic Code for Medical and Health Ethics. Islamic Organization for Medical Science, Kuwait2005Google Scholar). Certainty of genetic/paternal lineage in this tradition is critical. Consequently, embryo donation to other couples is prohibited (El-Gendy, 2005El-Gendy A.R. “Transplanting and implanting cells of the brain and nervous system” and “The extent of making use of aborted fetuses, surplus zygotes, and anencephalic babies,” in The International Islamic Code for Medical and Health Ethics. Islamic Organization for Medical Science, Kuwait2005Google Scholar). In addition, there is concern about the mistaken use or fraudulent misappropriation of stored embryos. Islamic couples may therefore on religious grounds refuse embryo freezing, but approve fresh embryo donation for hESC research. For these and other reasons, what has been termed “a fair number” of couples and individuals knowingly and voluntarily choose not to freeze their remaining fresh embryos and elect to donate them for hESC research (Barratt et al., 2004Barratt C.L. St. John J.C.C. Afnan M. Lancet. 2004; 364: 115-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Three major ethical concerns have been raised about the use of surplus fresh embryos as a source of hESC lines: whether there is sufficient time for patients and their spouses or partners to make an informed decision to donate such embryos, whether this practice runs contrary to the interests of women who donate such embryos, and whether potential donors might be subjected to undue pressure or coercion from their treating physician to donate fresh embryos. Given the need to obtain and use fresh embryos for hESC research rapidly once they have been developed, some express concern that those who have just completed an egg retrieval for IVF do not have sufficient time (∼3–5 days) to make an informed choice about whether to donate surplus fresh embryos for hESC research (Nisker and White, 2005Nisker J. White A. CMAJ. 2005; 173: 621-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Baylis and McInnes, 2007Baylis F. McInnes C. Women at risk: embryonic and fetal stem cell research in Canada.McGill Health Law Publication. 2007; 1: 53-67Google Scholar; see also Australian Senate). These commentators argue that such couples and individuals must make a hasty decision that they might later come to regret. That couples and individuals might have insufficient time to decide about the disposition of surplus fresh embryos would be of concern if they could only make a choice about the donation of such embryos for hESC research after the completion of an IVF egg retrieval. To avoid the need to make a rapid decision at that time, the Canadian SCOC guidelines require that patients follow a two-stage consent process for determining the disposition of surplus embryos. The first stage of this consent process takes place prior to the initiation of any IVF treatment when couples or individuals meet with a fertility specialist to discuss their situation. They must be informed at this time that fresh embryos might remain at the completion of the upcoming IVF cycle and make a preliminary and revocable decision about the future disposition of such embryos: to cryopreserve them, donate them to another couple, donate them for research, or discard them. The second stage of the consent process outlined in the Canadian guidelines occurs after some embryos have been transferred and patients and their spouses or partners must make a decision about the disposition of any embryos that remain. At this time, patients are required, not just allowed, by the Canadian SCOC guidelines to review their earlier decision and either to confirm or to change it. Only if they choose not to freeze and not to destroy their surplus fresh embryos can they elect to make them available for pluripotent stem cell research. Thus, the final decision to donate surplus embryos for research is not made until after the disposition decision has been made. These stipulations of the Canadian stem cell guidelines honor the right of patients to control the disposition of their surplus embryos and, by instituting a process that gives them a period of time that can amount to several months in which to decide about this, avoid the need for them to make a hasty choice about the disposition of their surplus fresh embryos. Another ethical objection raised against the donation of surplus fresh embryos for hESC research is that to allow this practice would not be in the best interests of women donors, since they would no longer have cryopreserved embryos remaining for subsequent IVF attempts and would thus decrease their future chances of pregnancy (Nisker and White, 2005Nisker J. White A. CMAJ. 2005; 173: 621-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Baylis and McInnes, 2007Baylis F. McInnes C. Women at risk: embryonic and fetal stem cell research in Canada.McGill Health Law Publication. 2007; 1: 53-67Google Scholar). Critics of the use of fresh embryos point out further that women who decide not to cryopreserve surplus embryos and instead choose to donate them for hESC research would have to undergo the onerous process of ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval once again should they undertake additional IVF cycles in the future. This, they maintain, is contrary to the interests of these women. Some among these commentators also hold that because physicians are required by their professional code of ethics to attend to the best interests of their patients, and allowing the donation of surplus fresh embryos to research is not in the best interests of IVF patients, it is contrary to professional ethics to secure the donation of fresh embryos from women for hESC research (Nisker and White, 2005Nisker J. White A. CMAJ. 2005; 173: 621-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, because such patients have decided for medical and/or personal reasons, such as those discussed above, that they will not store embryos surplus to their current reproductive requirements in order to have them available for future IVF treatments, they do not inadvertently narrow their future treatment options by donating their surplus fresh embryos for hESC research. Moreover, the denial of information to patients for fear they might use it to make choices that appear to be against their interests invokes a now-discredited paternalistic approach to patient care that would deny patients the scope to make decisions medically considered contrary to their good (Cohen et al., 2008Cohen C.B. Enzle M.E. Dickens B. Brandhorst B. Clark T. Clute C. Dunstan D. Evans D. Lambert R.D. Langlois S. et al.Health Law Rev. 2008; 16: 86-102Google Scholar). To decide against offering them the option of donating surplus fresh embryos for hESC research would be to deny the moral imperative behind the professional requirement to treat patients with respect. A closely related issue is that patients might feel obliged or pressured to accede to a request from their treating physician to consent to the donation of surplus fresh embryos to stem cell investigators, as such patients are highly dependent on that physician to assist them to have long-desired children (Cohen, 2001Cohen C.B. Leaps and boundaries: expanding oversight of human stem cell research.in: Holland S. Lebacqz K. Zoloth L. The Human Embryonic Stem Cell Debate: Science, Ethics, and Public Policy. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2001: 209-222Google Scholar). This issue is addressed by the Canadian SCOC guidelines through a requirement that members of the health team treating and/or counseling the patient should not be the persons who obtain consent at the time of reconsent. Before treatment begins, patients must make several decisions about the upcoming procedure and the course of treatment, including a decision about the disposition of any embryos that might remain at the completion of the IVF cycle. Receiving and understanding such information necessarily involves an initial interview (or interviews) with the physician responsible for their care. Despite the best intentions, a physician especially interested in promoting hESC research might unduly encourage patients to donate surplus embryos to that research. This possibility must be balanced against the benefit to patients of entering into an open relationship with their physician during the course of the upcoming IVF treatment. That balance weighs in favor of supporting the physician-patient relationship by allowing the treating physician to conduct the initial interview before treatment. The physician has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of patients, and the presumption is that he or she will do so unless the contrary is shown. The possibility that physicians will pressure patients undergoing IVF to donate surplus fresh embryos for hESC research is further lessened by the requirement of the SCOC guidelines that the treating physician should not be a member of the stem cell research team. After embryo transfer, patients and their spouses or partners, including those who have elected not to freeze any remaining embryos, are approached once again about the disposition of these embryos. The Canadian SCOC guidelines require that at this time someone who is not a member of the treatment or counseling team must provide them with information about the options open to them and obtain consent from them for the donation of their surplus embryos, if that is the option they choose. The guidelines do not identify a specific professional who would obtain consent at this time from potential embryo donors to hESC research. In practice, the usual individual to do so would be the director of the human IVF laboratory—a person with knowledge of the proposed research who has no contact with the embryo donors or responsibility for any aspect of their clinical care or for the work of stem cell investigators. The introduction of a third party need not interfere with the relationship between patients and their treating physicians, as they have already addressed most of the treatment-related questions and the question of what to do with surplus embryos is not specifically related to patients' further treatment. Several other bodies also recognize the need to have someone other than the treating physician and team request consent to embryo donation for hESC research, including the Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2004American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Ethics CommitteeFertil. Steril. 2004; 82: S224-S227PubMed Google Scholar) and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority of the United Kingdom (see HFEA). The “Sample Research Consent Form, Embryo Donation for Stem Cell Research” of the International Society for Stem Cell Research indicates that this group takes the same stance when it maintains that “if you are undergoing fertility treatment, your treating physician will not know what you have decided [about embryo donation], unless you choose to provide this information” (see ISSCR). There is growing agreement that a trained and qualified individual with knowledge of the proposed research who understands the risks involved and who is not a member of the IVF treatment team should seek consent for the donation of surplus embryos. Thus, a clear separation is built into these guidelines between members of the IVF treatment team and those who obtain final consent from patients to the donation of embryos for stem cell research, as well as between the treating physician and those who conduct stem cell research. In order to emphasize this, as well as other aspects of the informed consent process, the SCOC has placed on its web site two sample consent forms for the donation of surplus embryos for hESC research that track the Canadian guidelines, one relevant to the donation of cryopreserved embryos and the other to the donation of fresh embryos (see Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Stem Cell Oversight Committee). These reaffirm not only the requirements of these guidelines specifically discussed here, but also several other requirements. Among these are that patients must be informed that no personal identifiers will be provided to stem cell investigators (except if the research involves autologous donation); that they have a right to withdraw at any time before an anonymized cell line is created; that the proposed research could result in the production of a stem cell line that could be maintained for many years, distributed to other parts of the world, and used for various research purposes; and that they will not benefit financially from any further commercialization of cell lines or be able to direct the donation of cell lines to particular individuals. The major ethical and policy issues raised by the donation of surplus fresh embryos for hESC research can therefore be addressed by (1) providing a two-stage consent process that offers an adequate amount of time for couples and individuals to decide about whether to donate such embryos; (2) supporting the right of women undergoing IVF to be informed of the options available, including the option of donating fresh embryos to research, and to decide among them freely on the basis of their beliefs and values; and (3) avoiding the possibility that potential embryo donors might be subjected to undue pressure from treating physicians by specifying that (a) the treating physician and team, as well as the counseling team, are prohibited from requesting the donation of such embryos at the second stage of the consent process and that (b) the treating physician must not be a member of a stem cell research team. These requirements of the Canadian SCOC guidelines, along with several other requirements that they set out, protect the rights and interests of those who elect to make a voluntary and informed choice to donate surplus fresh embryos for hESC research. The option of using surplus fresh embryos of both good and poor quality in research directed toward developing a greater number of hESC lines is attractive because of the demonstrated effectiveness of their use as a source of such lines. Large numbers of fresh embryos that are not clinically useful because of poor assessed quality are potentially available for the production of such lines. The use of fresh embryos for this purpose, however, raises ethical and policy challenges regarding the respectful treatment of those undergoing ART treatment who wish to donate surplus fresh embryos for hESC research; these challenges must be addressed if public confidence in both ART treatment and hESC research is to be maintained."

Elucidation of the recognition mechanism is important for the development of therapeutic or diagnostic agents for ciguatera, and furthermore, analytical reagents and catalysts for the synthesis of other polyether-like compounds. We focused our investigation on anti-ciguatoxin antibody 10C9 and the mechanism by which it recognizes the ABCD-ring and ABCDE-ring fragments of CTX3C (Fig. 1). For that purpose, we determined the crystal structures of 10C9 Fab in the ligand-free form and in complex with CTX3C-ABCD or CTX3C-ABCDE. Comparison of the three structures revealed that recognition of the CTX3C fragments by 10C9 Fab involves three features: a large, deep antigen-binding pocket that captures the fragments, polar residues that form hydrogen bonds with the antigens, and rotational conformational changes that stabilize the complexes. Preparation of Antigen Fragments CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE—The left-hand portions of CTX3C (CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE) were synthesized according to previously described methods (22Hirama M. Oishi T. Uehara H. Inoue M. Maruyama M. Guri H. Satake M. Science. 2001; 294: 1904-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Oishi T. Tanaka S. Ogasawara Y. Maeda K. Oguri H. Hirama M. Synlett. 2001; 2001: 952-954Crossref Google Scholar). CTX3C-ABCDE was conjugated to KLH to yield ABCDE-KLH for immunization of mice to prepare the 10C9 monoclonal antibody (11Oguri H. Hirama M. Tsumuraya T. Fujii I. Maruyama M. Uehara H. Nagumo Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 7608-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Preparation of 10C9 Fab—10C9 IgG was prepared as described previously (11Oguri H. Hirama M. Tsumuraya T. Fujii I. Maruyama M. Uehara H. Nagumo Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 7608-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 10C9 Fab was obtained by papain digestion of 10C9 IgG and purified on a Protein A column (Fab preparation kit; Pierce) followed by cation exchange chromatography (Resource S column; GE Healthcare) and size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad™ 26/60 Superdex 200; GE Healthcare). The purity and homogeneity of the fragment were evaluated by means of SDS-PAGE. Crystallization of Ligand-free 10C9 Fab and Its Complexes with CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE—Purified 10C9 Fab was dialyzed against a stock buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then concentrated to 8 mg ml-1 for crystallization trials. For preparation of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex, the appropriate amount of a 500 μm CTX3C-ABCD solution in DMSO was added to the protein solution (final 10C9 Fab/CTX3C-ABCD molar ratio, 1:1.7), and for preparation of the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex, a 5 mm CTX3C-ABCDE solution in DMSO was added to the protein solution (final 10C9 Fab/CTX3C-ABCDE molar ratio, 1:1.2). The mixtures were subjected to static incubation at room temperature for 1 h prior to crystallization experiment. The initial crystallization conditions were screened by the sparse matrix method at 20 °C using Crystal Screen and Crystal Screen 2 kits (Hampton Research) and Wizard I and Wizard II screening kits (Emerald Biostructures, Bainbridge Island, WA). Crystals of ligand-free 10C9 Fab suitable for data collection were grown from 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 5.2) containing 0.2 m zinc acetate and 15% polyethylene glycol 8000 by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complexes were grown from 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6) containing 0.2 m ammonium sulfate and 30% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000 and from 0.1 m trisodium citrate dehydrate (pH 5.6) containing 20% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, respectively. Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction experiments were performed at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The data set for crystals of ligand-free 10C9 Fab was collected on beamline NW12 under cryogenic conditions (100 K), and the data sets for the complexes with CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE were collected on beamlines 6a and 5a, respectively. Diffraction data for the ligand-free fragment and the two complexes were collected to a maximum resolutions of 2.6, 2.4, and 2.3 Å, respectively. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL-2000 program package (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Data collection and processing statistics are summarized in supplemental Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structures of 10C9 Fab in the ligand-free state and in complexes with CTX3C-ABCD or CTX3C-ABCDE were determined by the molecular replacement method using the program PHASER (25Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The heavy and light chains of 10C9 Fab (Protein Data Bank codes 1HQ4 and 1Z3G, respectively) were used as search models for the heavy and light chains of 10C9 Fab in complex with CTX3C-ABCD. Then, the heavy and light chains of 10C9 Fab in complex with CTX3C-ABCD were subsequently used as search models for 10C9 Fab in the ligand-free state and in complex with CTX3C-ABCDE. The structural coordinates of CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE were modeled manually with the graphical program XtalView (26McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The coordination file, the topology file, and the parameter file for CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE were prepared with the Dundee PRODRG2 Server (available on the World Wide Web). To monitor the quality of refinement, a random 10% subset of all the reflections was set aside for calculation of the Rfree-factor. The positional and individual B-factor refinements of structures in the ligand-free form and in complex with CTX3C-ABCDE were carried out with the program CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The refinement of the structure in complex with CTX3C-ABCD was carried out with the program REFMAC5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Finally, the water molecules were added automatically, and then ligand molecules were placed manually. The crystallographic R and Rfree values of 10C9 Fab in the ligand-free state and in complexes with CTX3C-ABCDE and CTX3C-ABCD converged to 22.0 and 27.0%, 22.8 and 26.9%, and 29.8 and 33.9%, respectively. The stereochemical quality of the final refined models was analyzed with the program PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table 1. Structural Comparison between Ligand-free Fab and Its Complexes—The three-dimensional structures of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complexes were superimposed on the structure of ligand-free 10C9 Fab with the LSQKAB program (part of the CCP4 suite of programs) (30Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations between the complexes and ligand-free 10C9 Fab were calculated with the COMPARE program (also part of the CCP4 suite) (31Acta Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures were generated by the PyMol program, which provides a high quality rendering of three-dimensional structure (available on the World Wide Web). Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—The thermodynamic parameters of the interactions between 10C9 Fab and the two antigen fragments were determined by isothermal titration microcalorimetry with a VP-ITC Micro Calorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). The antigen fragments (∼5 μm in phosphate-buffered saline) were titrated with a 50 μm solution of 10C9 Fab in the same buffer at 25 °C. Thermogram data were analyzed by means of the ORIGIN program (MicroCal). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The thermostabilities of 10C9 Fab in the ligand-free state and in complexes with CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE were evaluated with a VP-DSC Capillary Cell Micro Calorimeter (MicroCal Inc.). 10C9 Fab (20 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) was used for the measurements. The antigen fragments were separately dissolved in DMSO, and the solutions were added to the protein solution (final 10C9 Fab/antigen molar ratio, 1:1.2). The temperature value at the peak partial molar heat capacity was taken as the Tm value for the species. Crystal Structures of 10C9 Fab in the Ligand-free Form and in Complexes with CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE—The crystal structure of ligand-free 10C9 Fab was determined by the molecular replacement method at a resolution of 2.6 Å (supplemental Table 1). The structure shows that 10C9 Fab possess an extraordinarily large and deep pocket (depth, 11 Å) in the interface between the variable heavy and light chains (VH and VL). Aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid residues, such as L-Tyr36, 4Residues are denoted in the following manner: H-Asn58, the asparagine 58 (Kabat number) of the 10C9 Fab heavy chain. H-Ile37, L-Trp91, H-Trp47, and H-Trp103 are present on the surface of the pocket, providing a hydrophobic environment for CTX3C binding. The extraordinary large antigen-binding pocket probably stabilizes CTX3C by sequestering it away from solvent. There are also charged residues, such as L-His34, H-His35A, H-Asn58, L-Arg46, and L-Gln89, in the pocket. Two 10C9 Fab molecules are arranged in an asymmetric unit in the crystal. Some atoms of the side chains in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the heavy chain (CDR-H1, from H-Thr30 to H-Gly32; CDR-H2, from H-His52 to H-Arg54; and CDR-H3, from H-Phe97 to H-Ser99) are disordered and could not be precisely located in either molecule of the asymmetric unit, although atoms of the main chains could be located. These results suggest that the some regions of the CDR loops are flexible in the ligand-free molecule (32Mian I.S. Bradwell A.R. Olson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 133-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 33Vasudevan S. Celikel R. Ruggeri Z.M. Varughese K.I. Kunicki T.J. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition, residues from H-Ser128 to H-Asn133 in the CH1 domain were completely disordered due to the flexibility of the loop. The crystal structures of the 10C9 Fab complexes with CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE were determined at resolutions of 2.4 and 2.3 Å, respectively (supplemental Table 1). In the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex, two molecules are arranged in the asymmetric unit. The electron density map of the variable region of one of the molecules was too poorly defined to build a model due to the high flexibility of the protein. Nevertheless we were able to construct a model of the other molecule, although the residues from L-Ile150 to L-Gln156, from L-Thr180 to L-Tyr192, from H-Gly127 to H-Val136, and from H-Pro184 to H-Ser186 in the constant region of this molecule are also disordered. These structural flexibilities caused high R- and Rfree-factors in the structural refinement procedure. Although we could not build a complete structural model of the constant regions, one of the 10C9 Fab molecule in complex with CTX3C-ABCD was well defined. It is noteworthy to mention that the electron density maps of the CDR loops in the CTX3C-ABCD complex were well defined, whereas the electron density maps of the same regions in the ligand-free form were significantly no islet. This result suggests that the CDR loops are fixed upon binding to CTX3C-ABCD. For the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex, we constructed a structural model for all of the residues except for those in the region (from H-Gly127 to H-Asn133), which is completely disordered. Note that the electron density map of the CDRs was well defined in the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex, as was the case for the CTX3C-ABCD complex. These results suggest that the flexible loops of the CDR are stabilized upon complexation with the antigen fragments. The structures of 10C9 Fab in ligand-free form and in complexes with CTX3C-ABCD and with CTX3C-ABCDE are shown in Fig. 2. Both antigen fragments are longitudinally bound within the pocket with the A-ring directed toward the bottom of the pocket. CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE are buried inside the pocket to a length of ∼10 Å, and the surface areas buried within the cavity are 90 and 80%, respectively. A tail of CTX3C-ABCDE protrudes from the cavity. In ligand-free 10C9 Fab, the pocket is present at the center of the variable region prior to antigen binding, although the entrance of the pocket is very narrow. The antigen-binding pocket is expanded by flipping of the side chain of L-Trp91 at the entrance of the pocket. The crystal structures of both complexes indicate that the indole ring flips around to open the gate for the antigens and provide a large hydrophobic space for them to bind (supplemental Fig. 1). Antigen-Antibody Interactions—In the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complexes, the antigen fragments are positioned identically within the binding pocket (Fig. 3). The numbers of water molecules in the binding pocket are equal for the three crystal structures. Although the positions of the water molecules are not the same in the three 10C9 Fab structures, there are two hydrated water molecules at the interface between the antigen fragment and the antibody in the crystal structures of the complexes, and they bridge the space between the antigen fragments and 10C9 Fab by forming hydrogen bonds. In both complexes, the side chains facing the antigen fragments are almost identical in conformation and orientation, except for H-Asn58. Fig. 4 shows a close-up view of the entrance to the antigen-binding pocket in the two complexes. In the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex, a hydrogen bond between Of of CTX3C-ABCDE and H-Asn58-NH of 10C9 Fab creates a network of hydrogen bonds between H-Asn58, H-Tyr59, and L-Asn94. These interactions are believed to stabilize the complex. In contrast, the network of hydrogen bonds between H-Asn58, H-Tyr59, and L-Asn94 is not present in the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex, due to rotation of the side chain of H-Asn58. The presence of the hydrogen bond between H-Asn58 and CTX3C-ABCDE may explain why the enthalpy of binding is more favorable with CTX3C-ABCDE than with CTX3C-ABCD (Table 1).TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters of the interactions between 10C9 Fab and the antigen fragments N, stoichiometry; Ka, binding constant; ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS, changes in Gibbs energy, binding enthalpy, and entropy, respectively.AntigenNKaΔGΔHΔS× 107 m–1kJ mol–1kJ mol–1kJ mol–1 K–1CTX3C-ABCDE0.94 ± 0.00449.02 ± 1.63–91.0–68.4 ± 0.60–0.076CTX3C-ABCD0.91 ± 0.01691.50 ± 0.38–50.0–45.7 ± 1.21–0.015 Open table in a new tab The interactions between atoms in CTX3C-ABCD and 10C9 Fab and between atoms in CTX3C-ABCDE and 10C9 Fab were evaluated on the basis of the three-dimensional structures (supplemental Fig. 2, supplemental Table 2). Van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds were involved in the direct antigen-antibody interactions in both complexes. The number of hydrogen bonds at the interface between CTX3C-ABCD and 10C9 Fab is nearly equal to the number at the interface between CTX3C-ABCDE and 10C9 Fab; there is a weak hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom of the L-Arg46 side chain in 10C9 Fab and the Oa atom of CTX3C-ABCD (bond distance, 3.4 Å) that is not present in the other complex. Although the numbers of residues interacting with the antigen fragments in the two complexes are nearly identical, the total number of interactions of 10C9 Fab with CTX3C-ABCDE (70 interactions) is larger than the number of interactions with CTX3C-ABCD (55 interactions), which indicates that the conformation of the complex with CTX3C-ABCDE is more complementary than that of the complex with CTX3C-ABCD. In particular, the number of interactions with L-Tyr36 and L-Pro96 (located in framework L2 and CDR L3, respectively) is substantially higher for CTX3C-ABCDE than for CTX3C-ABCD. In contrast, the contribution of L-Trp91 to the antigen-antibody interaction is larger in the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex than in the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex. L-Trp91 interacts mainly with the C- and D-rings of the antigen fragments through van der Waals interactions, which may contribute to keep each antigen fragment on the paratope. Note that not all of the amino acid residues of the flexible loops of the CDRs, which are disordered in ligand-free 10C9 Fab, interact directly with either antigen fragment, although the residues at the bottom of the flexible loops do form direct interactions. Taking all these results together, we conclude that the two antigen fragments are bound in 10C9 Fab in an identical manner, although there are some differences in the number of interactions and in the extent of the hydrogen-bonding network. To investigate how 10C9 was matured, we compared the rearranged sequence of 10C9 with that of the corresponding germ line gene (supplemental Fig. 3). There are seven (H-Gln3, H-Asn34, H-Arg54, H-Thr56, H-Thr61, H-Ser73, and H-Cys94) and eight mutated residues (L-Glu1, L-Leu2, L-Met4, L-Thr7, L-Ser32, L-Val33, L-Pro55, and L-Gly60) in variable regions of heavy and light chains, respectively. Among them, three residues (i.e. H-Asn34, H-Thr61, and L-Pro55) are located in the vicinity of the ligand binding site (supplemental Fig. 4). Although they do not interact with the antigen directly, it is possible that these residues contribute to ligand binding. H-Asn34 would play an important role in capturing the antigen via hydrogen bonding with a water molecule that interacts with both CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE in the antigen binding pocket. Since H-Thr61 forms a hydrogen bond with L-Asn94, it is plausible that H-Thr61 contributes by stabilizing the VH-VL interaction. L-Pro55 seems to fix the loop structure of CDR-L2, which forms the external wall of the antigen binding pocket. Stabilization of the 10C9 Fab Complexes—We carried out an isothermal titration calorimetry study of the associations between 10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE (supplemental Fig. 5). Thermodynamic parameters calculated from the titration curves are presented in Table 1. The isothermal titration calorimetry study indicated that both CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE bind to 10C9 Fab with a 1:1 stoichiometry, a result that agrees with the results of the x-ray crystallographic analysis. The association constants for CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE were estimated to be 1.50 × 107 m-1 and 9.02 × 107 m-1, respectively, indicating that absence of the E-ring reduces the binding affinity by a factor of six. The binding enthalpies for CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE were estimated to be -45.7 and -68.4 kJ/mol, respectively, suggesting that the interaction between 10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCDE is more enthalpically favorable than that between 10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCD. In contrast, the binding entropies for CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE to 10C9 Fab were determined to be -0.015 and -0.076 kJ mol-1 K-1, respectively, suggesting that the interaction between 10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCDE is accompanied by a larger entropic loss due to binding. Although the interactions are enthalpy-driven in both cases, the binding enthalpy for the interaction with CTX3C-ABCDE is ∼20 kJ/mol larger than that with CTX3C-ABCD, which suggests that the enthalpic contribution is significant for CTX3C-ABCDE. In general, favorable entropy increases are caused by the release of water molecules from the interface between two bound species (34Braden B.C. Goldman E.R. Mariuzza R.A. Poljak R.J. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Considering that binding of the antigen fragments did not change the number nor the arrangement of water molecules in the binding pocket, the entropy difference appears to be due to differences in the conformational degrees of freedom in the two complexes (35Finkelstein A.V. Janin J. Protein Engineering. 1989; 3: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) (i.e. there are more degrees of freedom in the complex with CTX3C-ABCD than in the complex with CTX3C-ABCDE). These results suggest that the enhanced binding affinity of the longer antigen (bearing the E-ring) is due to a favorable enthalpy change. To investigate the increases in stability upon ligand binding, we determined the thermostabilities of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complexes and ligand-free 10C9 Fab by differential scanning calorimetry (supplemental Fig. 6). Ligand-free 10C9 Fab exhibited a thermogram with a peak at ∼78 °C, which is a typical Tm value for antigen-binding fragments (36Garber E. Demarest S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Demarest S.J. Chen G. Kimmel B.E. Gustafson D. Wu J. Salbato J. Poland J. Elia M. Tan X. Wong K. Short J. Hansen G. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2006; 19: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Tm value for the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex is nearly identical to that of the ligand-free form, whereas the Tm value for the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex is substantially higher (86.8 °C). These results indicate that the stability of 10C9 Fab is markedly increased upon binding of CTX3C-ABCDE but not CTX3C-ABCD. The interaction of 10C9 Fab with the E-ring may be what leads to the increased thermostability of 10C9 Fab. Induced Fitting Mechanism for the Antigen Fragments—We investigated the conformational changes that 10C9 Fab undergoes upon complexation with the antigen fragments to clarify the difference between the thermostabilities of the two complexes. Fig. 5 shows the structural differences in the variable regions of 10C9 Fab in the ligand-free state and in complexes with the antigen fragments. 10C9 Fab clearly undergoes rotational motion to accommodate the large, rigid polycyclic ethers, and there is a major difference in the degree of movement for the two complexes. In fact, 10C9 Fab seems to require a large motion to capture CTX3C-ABCD. To evaluate the difference between the conformational changes for the two complexes, we calculated the r.m.s. deviations by superimposing the Cα atoms of the VH, VL, CH1, and CL domains of ligand-free 10C9 Fab with those of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complexes (supplemental Table 3). When the VH domain of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex was superimposed on that of the ligand-free form, the r.m.s. deviation of the VL domain was ∼2.5 times that of the VH domain itself, which indicates marked conformational changes in the variable region. In contrast, when the VH domain of the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex was superimposed on that of the ligand-free form, the r.m.s. deviation of the VL domain was only 1.9 times that of the VH domain itself. These results indicate that 10C9 Fab undergoes a large rotational movement of the entire variable region to recognize CTX3C-ABCD but only a moderate movement to recognize CTX3C-ABCDE. To investigate the overall conformational changes in 10C9 Fab caused by binding to the antigen fragments, we also investigated the constant regions of 10C9 Fab. When the CH1 and CL domains of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex were superimposed on the respective domains of the ligand-free form, the r.m.s. deviation of the complementary domain was more than 2 times that of the corresponding domain itself. We believe that the structural change in the variable region of 10C9 Fab upon complexation with CTX3C-ABCD causes a large conformational change in the constant region. In contrast, in the case of the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex, no significant increase in the r.m.s. deviations of the complementary domains was observed. This result suggests that the lower thermostability of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex relative to that of the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex is due to the marked conformational change that occurs in the constant region as a result of the large movement in the variable region of 10C9 Fab upon complexation with CTX3C-ABCD. Contribution of the E-ring to the Stability of the Antigen-Antibody Complex—The crystallographic temperature factors of the Cα atoms in the heavy chains of ligand-free 10C9 Fab and the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complexes were investigated (supplemental Fig. 7). Because the constant region in the light chain of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex is disordered, the temperature factor of the light chain could not be compared with the factors for ligand-free 10C9 Fab and the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex. In both complexes, the B-factor values of the variable regions are lower than the value for the ligand-free 10C9 Fab. In ligand-free 10C9 Fab, there are several regions whose temperature factors are particularly high; all of the regions are CDRs: CDR-H1, Leu20–Thr30; CDR-H2, Tyr50–Arg54, and CDR-H3, Asp95–Asp101. This fact indicates that these loops are flexible (38Haruyama H. Ito S. Miyadai K. Takahashi T. Kawaida R. Takayama T. Hanzawa H. Hata T. Yamaguchi J. Yoshida-Kato H. Ichikawa K. Ohsumi J.

However, these temperature factors are markedly reduced in both complexes, which suggests that the CDRs are well stabilized upon complexation. A large difference in B-factor values between the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab and CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complexes was observed in the constant region (i.e. the temperature factors in the constant region of the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex are markedly increased upon ligand binding, whereas those in the CTX3C-ABCDE complex are decreased). These results suggest that the entire constant region in the CTX3C-ABCD·10C9 Fab complex is perturbed and destabilized compared with the identical region of ligand-free 10C9 Fab, although the constant region of the CTX3C-ABCDE·10C9 Fab complex is well stabilized. The difference between the thermostabilities of CTX3C-ABCD and CTX3C-ABCDE complexes (supplemental Fig. 6) is due to destabilization in the constant region of the CTX3C-ABCD complex. Therefore, it is plausible that the structural difference between the antigen fragments (i.e. the presence or absence of the E-ring) induces large differences in the structure and stability of the complex. Recognition Mechanism for Ladder-like Polycyclic Ether Compounds—Because 10C9 Fab was prepared by immunization of mice with KLH-conjugated CTX3C-ABCDE (Fig. 1) (11Oguri H. Hirama M. Tsumuraya T. Fujii I. Maruyama M. Uehara H. Nagumo Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 7608-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the ligand-binding pocket of 10C9 Fab can be expected to be more suitable for CTX3C-ABCDE than for CTX3C-ABCD, and this expectation is confirmed with the results of our thermodynamic analyses. There are five common features of the interactions between 10C9 Fab and the two antigen fragments: the extraordinarily large and deep antigen-binding pocket, some hydrogen bonds and numerous van der Waals interactions in the antigen-binding site, the contribution of favorable enthalpy upon binding, rotational movement of the variable region upon complexation, and lowering of the B-factor values of the variable region of the complexes. The difference between the two antigen fragments with regard to the antigen-antibody interactions upon complexation is in the degree of structural rearrangement of 10C9 Fab. Upon complexation with CTX3C-ABCD or CTX3C-ABCDE, the entrance to the binding pocket of 10C9 Fab expands, and the structure of the protein adjusts to the antigen fragments by means of a rotational motion in the variable region, which extends to the constant region in the case of CTX3C-ABCD. Conformational rearrangement of 10C9 Fab provides the well established interactions with the antigen fragments. The hydrogen bond between the E-ring of CTX3C-ABCDE and H-Asn58 of 10C9 Fab is important for stabilizing the antigen-antibody complex; the hydrogen bond forms part of an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network that contributes to stable complex formation (Fig. 4). In fact, the thermostability of 10C9 Fab is enhanced by 10 °C upon complexation with CTX3C-ABCDE, and the B-factor values of the heavy chain decrease over the whole structure. In contrast, the incompleteness of the interaction with CTX3C-ABCD, due to the absence of the E-ring, induces a large structural rearrangement of 10C9 Fab in both the variable region and the constant region, which results in increases in the B-factor values of the constant region of the heavy chain. The contribution of the enthalpy upon binding is smaller for CTX3C-ABCD than for CTX3C-ABCDE, and this difference may originate from the distortion of the steric structure of 10C9 Fab in complex with CTX3C-ABCD. Taking all of our results together, we propose that 10C9 Fab recognizes ladder-like polycyclic ethers by means of the mechanism outlined in Fig. 6. 10C9 Fab contains a large, deep pocket to accommodate its large antigens. When CTX3C-ABCDE is inserted into the pocket, it imposes a rotational movement of the variable region of 10C9 Fab, and this movement stabilizes the complex. To bind to the smaller antigen (CTX3C-ABCD), 10C9 Fab must undergo a larger movement in the variable region to recognize the antigen, and this larger movement results in additional structural changes in the constant region, which destabilize the constant region. Our elucidation of the mechanism of the interaction between 10C9 Fab and antigen fragments should contribute to the fundamental understanding of the molecular recognition of polycyclic ether compound by antibodies. Conclusion—In this report, we present the first atomic level description of the mechanical system by which the antibody for polycyclic ether compounds recognizes its antigens. Anti-ciguatoxin antibody 10C9 Fab undergoes a conformational change in the variable region with rotational movement to accommodate the antigens, and this rotational movement sometimes induces additional motion in the constant region, depending on the antigen. The keys for the recognition of a polycyclic ether compound possessing a large, rigid structure like that of CTX3C are the presence of a suitable pocket that can form contacts with the majority of the surface of the antigens, and the presence of polar residues that can form hydrogen bonds with the antigens. We expect our findings to be useful for the development of novel therapeutic agents, analytical reagents, and detection systems for ciguatoxin-like polycyclic ether compounds and for the development of functional antibody-based materials in the fields of chemistry and protein engineering.

https://openalex.org/W2075998784,"Hypersensitive site 5 (5′HS5) of the β-globin Locus Control Region functions as a developmental stage-specific border in erythroid cells. Here, we have analyzed the role of 5′HS5 in the three dimensional organization of the β-gene locus using the Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) technique. The results show that when 5′HS5 is deleted from the locus, both remote and internal regulatory elements are still able to interact with each other in a three-dimensional configuration termed the Active Chromatin Hub. Thus, the absence of 5′HS5 does not have an appreciable effect on the three dimensional organization of the β-globin locus. This rules out models in which 5′HS5 nucleates interactions with remote and/or internal regulatory elements. We also determined the binding of CTCF, the only defined insulator protein in mammalian cells, to 5′HS5 by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We detect low levels of CTCF binding to 5′HS5 in primitive erythroid cells, in which it functions as a border element. Surprisingly, we also observe binding levels of CTCF to 5′HS5 in definitive erythroid cells. Thus, binding of CTCF to 5′HS5 per se does not render it a functional border element. This is consistent with the previous data suggesting that CTCF has dual functionality."

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells that retain properties of tissue-specific stem cells, including the ability to self-renew. In a recent article in Nature, Malanchi et al., 2008Malanchi I. Peinado H. Kassen D. Hussenet T. Metzger D. Chambon P. Huber M. Hohl D. Cano A. Birchmeier W. Huelsken J. Nature. 2008; 452: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar identified a population of CD34+ cells in epidermal tumors that require β-catenin signaling to maintain a CSC phenotype. Tissue-specific stem cells maintain a strictly regulated balance between self-renewal and differentiation to preserve the stem cell pool and give rise to all the cell lineages in the organ. Stem or progenitor cells may serve as cancer-initiating cells, following deregulation of the self-renewal process (Wicha et al., 2006Wicha M.S. Liu S. Dontu G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that cancer-initiating stem cells give rise to cancer stem cells (CSCs), although there is a lack of direct evidence that these are the same cell population. CSCs are a subpopulation of cells within tumors that retain stem cell properties, undergoing long-term self-renewal and driving tumor growth by giving rise to the differentiated cells that comprise the majority of the tumor mass. CSCs have been well-characterized in hematopoietic tumors, where serial transplantation studies in immunocompromised mice demonstrate that grafted CSCs give rise to tumors that maintain the complexity of the primary tumor. More recently, CSCs have been identified in solid tumors including breast, central nervous system, prostate, colon, and pancreas (Ailles and Weissman, 2007Ailles L.E. Weissman I.L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2007; 18: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M. Wicha M.S. Benito-Hernandez A. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (7896) Google Scholar). Mammalian epidermis is a rapidly renewing tissue and is maintained by stem cells that give rise to the differentiated lineages of the interfollicular epidermis, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and sweat glands. The bulge region of the murine hair follicle contains a population of multipotent stem cells capable of giving rise to all of the epithelial cell lineages within the hair follicle during normal hair growth and contributing transiently to the interfollicular epidermis in response to wounding. Whereas most epidermal cells are lost via a process of terminal differentiation, stem cells are long-term tissue residents capable of acquiring multiple genetic mutations over time, which can ultimately lead to tumor formation. There is convincing evidence that murine bulge stem cells are particular targets for carcinogen-mediated tumor initiation (Morris, 2000Morris R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phenotypically conserved stem and progenitor cell markers may be inherited by CSCs from the cell of origin, providing a stem cell identifier shared by normal tissue and multiple cancer histotypes that may arise there. In the murine epidermis, one such candidate marker is CD34, a cell-surface marker that has been used to enrich for multipotent stem cells from the hair follicle bulge (Trempus et al., 2003Trempus C.S. Morris R.J. Bortner C.D. Cotsarelis G. Faircloth R.S. Reece J.M. Tennant R.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Malanchi et al., 2008Malanchi I. Peinado H. Kassen D. Hussenet T. Metzger D. Chambon P. Huber M. Hohl D. Cano A. Birchmeier W. Huelsken J. Nature. 2008; 452: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar have characterized a subpopulation of CD34+ keratinocytes in murine epidermal tumors induced by chemical (DMBA/TPA) carcinogenesis. The percentage of CD34+ keratinocytes was increased in epidermal tumors (papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs]) versus normal epidermis, although it was not clearly demonstrated whether these cells are progeny of pre-existing CD34+ cells or de novo CD34-expressing cells. However, the CD34+ population exhibited phenotypic characteristics of bulge stem cells, including expression of bulge markers and an absence of the differentiation marker keratin 10. Importantly, in contrast to CD34− cells, a subpopulation of CD34+ cells were capable of giving rise to secondary and tertiary tumors that recapitulated the original tumor phenotype upon engraftment into immunocompromised mice (Figure 1B). Taken together, these results indicate that the CD34+ population contains CSCs. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated in maintaining stem cell homeostasis in most epithelial tissues including skin, mammary gland, and intestine. Furthermore, deregulation of this pathway often leads to formation of epithelial cancers (Reya and Clevers, 2005Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar). In the absence of active Wnt signaling, intracellular β-catenin is phosphorylated, targeting it for proteolytic degradation. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling inhibits this degradation, allowing β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus and form complexes with Tcf/Lef family transcription factors to modulate expression of multiple genes. In the skin, high levels of β-catenin lead to hair growth, ectopic hair follicle formation in transgenic mice (Silva-Vargas et al., 2005Silva-Vargas V. Lo Celso C. Giangreco A. Ofstad T. Prowse D.M. Braun K.M. Watt F.M. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and the formation of pilomatriculomas in both mice and man. In contrast, inhibiting β-catenin blocks formation of hair during development (Huelsken et al., 2001Huelsken J. Vogel R. Erdmann B. Cotsarelis G. Birchmeier W. Cell. 2001; 105: 533-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) or disrupts growth of pre-existing hair follicles in the adult. In addition, β-catenin has been implicated in bulge stem cell maintenance/activation. In chemically induced skin tumors, nuclear β-catenin was enriched in CD34+ versus CD34− tumor cells (Malanchi et al., 2008Malanchi I. Peinado H. Kassen D. Hussenet T. Metzger D. Chambon P. Huber M. Hohl D. Cano A. Birchmeier W. Huelsken J. Nature. 2008; 452: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential functional relevance for this pathway. More importantly, deletion of β-catenin in established tumors led to a reduction in the percentage of CD34+ cells, and the tumors regressed, as marked by extensive terminal differentiation (Figure 1B). The skin tumor regression phenotype was recapitulated following β-catenin deletion in another mouse skin tumor model (TG.AC) that expresses activated H-Ras. Taken together, these data suggest that β-catenin is required for Ras-driven skin tumorigenesis, although the mechanism of CSC loss following β-catenin deletion is not yet established. It should be noted that a keratin 14 promoter was used to target an inducible form of Cre recombinase in these mouse models. Since this promoter is active in all undifferentiated epidermal keratinocytes, the modifications in tumor phenotype cannot be solely attributed to deletion of β-catenin within the CSC subpopulation. Finally, Malanchi and colleagues (Malanchi et al., 2008Malanchi I. Peinado H. Kassen D. Hussenet T. Metzger D. Chambon P. Huber M. Hohl D. Cano A. Birchmeier W. Huelsken J. Nature. 2008; 452: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) provide evidence that β-catenin signaling may be functionally relevant in human SCCs. Both nuclear β-catenin and expression of the Wnt/β-catenin target gene conductin were detected in many human SCCs. Following knockdown of β-catenin expression by short hairpin RNA, tumor growth of human SCC13 cell lines was reduced in xenografts, suggesting that β-catenin signaling is required for tumorigenesis. However, as noted by the authors, nuclear β-catenin expression is not strictly a marker of CSCs, and CD34 is not expressed in human SCCs, precluding a CSC analysis of human tumors. In the human hair follicle, CD34 immunoreactivity is found below the bulge; however, there is no evidence that this marker enriches for stem cells. Several markers have been reported to enrich for human interfollicular stem cells, including high expression of β1 integrin, high expression of α6 integrin (in combination with low levels of CD71), and expression of melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan or Lrig1. In the human hair follicle, CD200-positive bulge cells have a high clonogenic-forming capacity in vitro, a characteristic associated with stem cells (Ohyama et al., 2006Ohyama M. Terunuma A. Tock C.L. Radonovich M.F. Pise-Masison C.A. Hopping S.B. Brady J.N. Udey M.C. Vogel J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Therefore, in future studies it will be useful to determine whether any of these markers identify CSCs within human epidermal tumors. In summary, Malanchi and colleagues (Malanchi et al., 2008Malanchi I. Peinado H. Kassen D. Hussenet T. Metzger D. Chambon P. Huber M. Hohl D. Cano A. Birchmeier W. Huelsken J. Nature. 2008; 452: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) elegantly demonstrate that murine cutaneous tumors contain a subpopulation of CSCs that can be enriched by selection for the follicular bulge cell surface marker, CD34. They provide convincing evidence that β-catenin signaling is required for growth of murine squamous cell carcinomas, most likely via the maintenance of CSCs, although the mechanism by which this occurs is still unclear. Finally, they demonstrate that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway also is activated in human malignant SCCs. However, the challenge remains to identify CSCs within human epidermal tumors. These studies are reminiscent of the role that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays in modulating stem cell maintenance and tumorigenesis in the intestinal tract, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeting this pathway may be beneficial in multiple epithelial tissues (Reya and Clevers, 2005Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar)."
