https://openalex.org/W2089082314,"Apoptosis provoked by DNA damage requires the p53 tumor suppressor, but which of the many p53-regulated genes are required has remained unknown. Two genes induced by this transcription factor, noxa and puma ( bbc3 ), stand out, because they encode BH3-only proteins, proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family required to initiate apoptosis. In mice with either noxa or puma disrupted, we observed decreased DNA damage–induced apoptosis in fibroblasts, although only loss of Puma protected lymphocytes from cell death. Puma deficiency also protected cells against diverse p53-independent cytotoxic insults, including cytokine deprivation and exposure to glucocorticoids, the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, or phorbol ester. Hence, Puma and Noxa are critical mediators of the apoptotic responses induced by p53 and other agents."

Using simulations of an atomistic model of water, we relate these frequency fluctuations to intermolecular dynamics. The model reveals that OH frequency shifts arise from changes in the molecular electric field that acts on the proton. At short times, vibrational dephasing reflects an underdamped oscillation of the hydrogen bond with a period of 170 femtoseconds. At longer times, vibrational correlations decay on a 1.2-picosecond time scale because of collective structural reorganizations."
https://openalex.org/W2031261181,"Although critical for development, immunity, wound healing, and metastasis, integrins represent one of the few classes of plasma membrane receptors for which the basic signaling mechanism remains a mystery. We investigated cytoplasmic conformational changes in the integrin LFA-1 (alphaLbeta2) in living cells by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer between cyan fluorescent protein-fused and yellow fluorescent protein-fused alphaL and beta2 cytoplasmic domains. In the resting state these domains were close to each other, but underwent significant spatial separation upon either intracellular activation of integrin adhesiveness (inside-out signaling) or ligand binding (outside-in signaling). Thus, bidirectional integrin signaling is accomplished by coupling extracellular conformational changes to an unclasping and separation of the alpha and beta cytoplasmic domains, a distinctive mechanism for transmitting information across the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1982607030,"Receptors for sex and adrenal steroid hormones are absent from fully sequenced invertebrate genomes and have not been recovered from other invertebrates. Here we report the isolation of an estrogen receptor ortholog from the mollusk Aplysia californica and the reconstruction, synthesis, and experimental characterization of functional domains of the ancestral protein from which all extant steroid receptors (SRs) evolved. Our findings indicate that SRs are extremely ancient and widespread, having diversified from a primordial gene before the origin of bilaterally symmetric animals, and that this ancient receptor had estrogen receptor-like functionality. This gene was lost in the lineage leading to arthropods and nematodes and became independent of hormone regulation in the Aplysia lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2081969319,"Dietary restriction (DR) increases life-span in organisms from yeast to mammals, presumably by slowing the accumulation of aging-related damage. Here we show that in Drosophila , DR extends life-span entirely by reducing the short-term risk of death. Two days after the application of DR at any age for the first time, previously fully fed flies are no more likely to die than flies of the same age that have been subjected to long-term DR. DR of mammals may also reduce short-term risk of death, and hence DR instigated at any age could generate a full reversal of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2069954000,"The measured dispersion of a low-loss, hollow-core photonic band-gap fiber is anomalous throughout most of the transmission band, and its variation with wavelength is large compared with that of a conventional step-index fiber. For an air-filled fiber, femtosecond self-frequency--shifted fundamental solitons with peak powers greater than 2megawatts can be supported. For Xe-filled fibers, nonfrequency-shifted temporal solitons with peak powers greater than 5.5 megawatts can be generated, representing an increase in the power that can be propagated in an optical fiber of two orders of magnitude. The results demonstrate a unique capability to deliver high-power pulses in a single spatial mode over distances exceeding 200 meters."

Mapping and excavation of archaeological structures document pronounced human-induced alteration of the forest cover, particularly in relation to large, dense late-prehistoric settlements (circa 1200 to 1600 A.D.). The findings contribute to debates on human carrying capacity, population size and settlement patterns, anthropogenic impacts on the environment, and the importance of indigenous knowledge, as well as contributing to the pride of place of the native peoples in this part of the Amazon."
https://openalex.org/W2031896641,We report the cancellation of the soliton self-frequency shift in a silica-core photonic crystal fiber with a negative dispersion slope. Numerical and experimental results show that stabilization of the soliton wavelength is accompanied by exponential amplification of the red-shifted Cherenkov radiation emitted by the soliton. The spectral recoil from the radiation acts on the soliton to compensate for the Raman frequency shift. This phenomenon may find applications in the development of a family of optical parametric amplifiers.
https://openalex.org/W2066015597,"Understanding the process of vector transduction has important implications for the application and optimal use of a vector system for human gene therapy. Recent studies with vectors based on adeno-associated virus type 5 (AAV-5) have shown utility of this vector system in the lung, central nervous system, muscle and eye. To understand the natural tropism of this virus and to identify proteins necessary for AAV-5 transduction, we characterized 43 cell lines as permissive or nonpermissive for AAV-5 transduction and compared the gene expression profiles derived from cDNA microarray analyses of those cell lines. A statistically significant correlation was observed between expression of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR-alpha-polypeptide) and AAV-5 transduction. Subsequent experiments confirmed the role of PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta as receptors for AAV-5. The tropism of AAV-5 in vivo also correlated with the expression pattern of PDGFR-alpha."

Though prohibitin has potent transcriptional functions in the nucleus, a mitochondrial role for prohibitin has also been proposed. Here we show that prohibitin is predominantly nuclear in two breast cancer cell lines where it co-localizes with E2F1 and p53. Upon apoptotic stimulation by camptothecin, prohibitin is exported to perinuclear regions where it localizes to mitochondria. The data presented here also show that prohibitin is capable of physically interacting with p53 in vivo and in vitro. Prohibitin was found to enhance p53-mediated transcriptional activity and cotransfection of an antisense prohibitin construct reduces p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Prohibitin appears to induce p53-mediated transcription by enhancing its recruitment to promoters, as detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.

These results suggest that prohibitin is capable of modulating Rb/E2F as well as p53 regulatory pathways. The E2F family of transcription factors play a major role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The E2F family members have been shown to upregulate the expression of many genes involved in G1/S transition and DNA synthesis such as cyclin E, Cdc25A, DHFR, and DNA polymerase α (reviewed in Refs. 1Dyson N.

The Rb family proteins have been shown to suppress E2F-mediated transcription by recruiting a variety of transcriptional co-repressors including HDAC1, DNMT, polycomb proteins as well as chromatin remodeling complexes like Brg and Brm (5Brehm A.

Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); this is achieved through induction of pro-apoptotic genes, including Apaf-1 and p73 (11Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C.

Studies from our laboratory showed that the activity of E2F transcription factors could be repressed by a potential tumor suppressor protein, prohibitin. Prohibitin was found to bind to the pocket domain of Rb family members and contact E2F family members through the marked box domain (15Wang S. Nath N. Adlam M. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3501-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Wang S. Nath N. Fusaro G. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7447-7460Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Though prohibitin was originally cloned based on its ability to induce growth arrest in human fibroblasts, its mode of action has remained unclear (17Nuell M.J. Stewart D.A. Walker L. Friedman V. Wood C.M. Owens G.A. Smith J.R. Schneider E.L. Dell' Orco R. Lumpkin C.K. Danner D.B. McClung J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1372-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 18Jupe E.R.

In addition to our findings on E2F regulation, a protein very similar to prohibitin has been found to regulate estrogen receptor-mediated transcription (19Delage-Mourroux R. Martini P.G. Choi I.

Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that prohibitin localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and inheritance (21Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 22Steglich G. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3435-3442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to study prohibitin-mediated regulation of E2F1 showed that while there are similarities with Rb in the repression patterns, there are significant differences in the mechanisms involved as well as how the two proteins respond to signals. Thus unlike Rb, prohibitin-mediated repression of E2F1 cannot be reversed by the adenovirus E1A protein, nor by cyclin D or E-associated kinase activity (16Wang S. Nath N. Fusaro G. Chellappan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7447-7460Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). While Rb recruits HDAC1 to repress E2F, prohibitin utilizes both HDAC1 and N-CoR for optimum repression of E2F activity (23Wang S. Fusaro G. Padmanabhan J. Chellappan S.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8388-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Chromatin-remodeling proteins like Brg and Brm are implicated in the repression mediated by both the proteins (24Wang S. Zhang B. Faller D.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3019-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We also find that prohibitin, when overexpressed in Ramos B cells, can protect against apoptosis induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (25Fusaro G. Wang S. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4539-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that prohibitin is a regulator of E2F function that aids in decisions between proliferation and apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic activity of E2F1 is negated by the anti-apoptotic activity of Rb (26Hseih J.-K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Like Rb, prohibitin has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in at least two different scenarios: in camptothecin-induced apoptosis as well as growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis (25Fusaro G. Wang S. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4539-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Vander Heiden M.G. Choy J.S. VanderWeele D.J. Brace J.L. Harris M.H. Bauer D.E. Prange B. Kron S.J. Thompson C.B. Rudin C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44870-44876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because of the important points of intersection of the E2F and p53 pathways, and because prohibitin regulates E2F function as well as apoptosis, experiments were designed to determine whether prohibitin and p53 functionally interact. We find that a significant portion of prohibitin is localized in the nucleus of T47D and MCF7 cells, where it co-localizes with both E2F1 and p53. After apoptosis induced by the drug camptothecin, however, these proteins are found mainly in the cytoplasm. We provide evidence that prohibitin can bind p53 and induce p53 transcripitonal activity while an antisense prohibitin construct ablates p53 activity. Overexpression of prohibitin also augmented promoter binding by p53 in vivo, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Conversely, prohibitin inhibited E2F1 binding to a target site in ChIP assays. Based on these results, we propose that prohibitin is a unique regulator of both E2F1 and p53, and may provide a link between proliferatory and apoptotic pathways. Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Transfections—T47D and MCF7 breast carcinoma cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The Ramos B cell lymphoma line was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable cell lines were selected in the presence of 40 μg/ml of G418 (Sigma). MCF7 cells expressing tetracycline-inducible prohibitin were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% tetracyclinefree fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 25 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), and 0.25 μg/ml Blasticidin (Invitrogen). Prohibitin expression was induced by incubation of the cells in 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. The MDM2-CAT reporter and pCMV.p53 vectors have been previously described (28Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D.

Transient transfections of T47D and MCF7 cells were performed by the calcium phosphate method with 2–8 μg of each plasmid DNA as previously described. Transient transfection of 1 × 107 Ramos cells was performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 400 mV. Each reaction contained 2 μg of β-galactosidase to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Assays for β-galactosidase activity and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity were performed 72 h after transfection using standard protocols (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning. 2 Ed. III. Cold Spring Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.59-16.62Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclear and Cytsolic Extracts—Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were made as described in Ref. 38Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar. Asynchronous MCF-7 cells were cultured to 70% confluence and incubated in the presence or absence of 30 μm camptothecin for 4 h at 37 °C. Briefly, the cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in one packed cell volume of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer 1 or NE1 (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cell suspension was passed through a 22-gauge needle five times. Thereafter the cell suspension was spun at 20,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was collected and spun down at 100,000 rpm. This was the cytosolic fraction that was aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in two-third-packed cell volume of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and rotated on ice for 30 min. The nuclear debris was spun down at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against NE1 for 2 h. The dialysate was aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. The purity of the nuclear fraction was assessed by performing a Western blot for PARP, using 50 μg of nuclear extract and cytosolic fraction. Physical interaction between proteins in vivo was analyzed by immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis using 200 μg of extract and 2 μg of the indicated antibody, as described before. In Vitro Binding Assay—GST, GST-p53, and GST-Phb were purified from bacterial cultures and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as previously described (15Wang S. Nath N. Adlam M. Chellappan S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3501-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Beads were then washed three times with PBS, and protein integrity was checked by polyacrylamide gel elecrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. [35S]Methionine-labeled lysates of p53 or prohibitin were made using the rabbit reticulocyte translation system according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). 10 μl of labeled lysates was incubated with an equivalent amount of GST or GST-Phb beads in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm KCI, 500 mm EDTA, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed in binding buffer six times. Bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Drug Treatment, Antibodies, and Immunostaining—The prohibitin monoclonal antibody was purchased from NeoMarkers, Inc. (Freemont, CA). The p53 polyclonal, E2F1 polyclonal and cytochrome c polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. T47D or MCF7 cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine (Sigma) coated 8-well glass chamber slides (10,000 cells per well). Cells were either untreated or treated with 30 μm camptothecin for 4 h (Sigma) unless otherwise indicated. Cells were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 25 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight with appropriate antibodies at 4 °C. After washing, secondary antibody incubation was performed with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor-488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor-546 for 30 min at room temperature. DNA was labeled with Hoechst staining at a final concentration of 0.0025 mg/ml. Cells were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) confocal microscope and areas of co-localization were determined using LSM 510 software (Zeiss). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—One confluent plate of T47D or MCF7 cells (about 3 × 106 cells per plate) were used for each immunoprecipitation reaction, as described previously (23Wang S. Fusaro G. Padmanabhan J. Chellappan S.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8388-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The HA monoclonal, p53 monoclonal, and E2F1 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The prohibitin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Neomarkers, Inc. (Freemont, CA). PCR reactions were then performed using 5 μl of the DNA from the immunoprecipitation reactions or 1 μl of DNA from the input reaction as template. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s; followed by 68 °C for 2 min. The sequences of the PCR primers used in the PCR reactions were as follows: MDM2 promoter (forward primer) 5′-AGTGTGAACGCTGCGCGTAGTC-3′, MDM2 promoter (reverse primer) 5′-CCCACAGGTCTACCCTCCAATC-3′, cdc25A promoter (forward primer) 5′-TCT GCT GGG AGT TTT CAT TGA CCT C-3′, cdc25A promoter (reverse primer) 5′-TTG GCG CCA AAC GGA ATC CAC CAA TC-3′, fos promoter (forward primer) 5′-TGT TGG CTG CAG CCC GCG AGC AGT TC -3′, fos promoter (reverse primer) 5′-GGC GCG TGT CCT AAT CTC GTG AGC AT-3′, MT-1G promoter (forward primer) 5′-TGC GCT CAA GGG ACC TTG CA-3′, MT-1G promoter (reverse primer) 5′-CTC GAG CCC AAC AGC CA-3′. Subcellular Localization of Prohibitin Changes upon Apoptotic Stimulation—Our earlier studies have shown that prohibitin represses E2F-mediated transcription and associates with E2Fs 1–5 in immunoprecipitation-Western blotting experiments. Since E2F1 is predominantly nuclear and other groups have proposed mitochondrial functions for prohibitin, we decided to examine where in the cell prohibitin binds to E2F1. For this purpose, human breast carcinoma T47D and MCF7 cells were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against prohibitin, and its presence detected by a secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor-488, a green fluorochrome. Cells were co-stained with a polyclonal antibody against E2F1 and detected by Alexa Fluor-546, a red fluorochrome. Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. E2F1 localized primarily in the nucleus of healthy cells, as expected (Fig. 1, A and C). Prohibitin also stained in a strikingly nuclear fashion in both cell lines. Discrete yellow or white areas of co-localization could be observed when the images were superimposed (Fig. 1, A and C). Experiments were designed to examine whether the localization pattern of the proteins was altered upon apoptotic stimulation with camptothecin. T47D and MCF7 cells were treated with 30 μm camptothecin for 4 h and the localization of prohibitin and E2F1 was determined by immunostaining as above. Both prohibitin and E2F1 were found primarily in the cytoplasm in both cell lines after treatment (Fig. 1, B and D). In addition, prohibitin staining appeared to occur in perinuclear regions. Almost no areas of co-localization were observed after camptothecin treatment, suggesting that very little, if any, prohibitin is associated with E2F1 in the cytoplasm.(Fig. 1, B and D). It may be concluded that the previously observed binding and functional interaction between E2F1 and prohibitin are predominantly nuclear events in proliferating cells. In response to camptothecin treatment, prohibitin translocates to the cytoplasmic compartment modulating the apoptotic response. Camptothecin Treatment Induces Partial Mitochondrial Localization of Prohibitin—Since it was found that camptothecin treatment induced prohibitin to exit from the nucleus to the perinuclear regions, it was next examined whether prohibitin co-localized to mitochondria in this area. Toward this purpose, cells were stimulated with camptothecin and a double immunofluorescence experiment was conducted to see whether prohibitin co-localized with the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c. The staining pattern was visualized by confocal microscopy. It was found that prohibitin staining was predominantly nuclear in untreated cells while cytochrome c appeared punctate throughout the cytoplasm and was absent in the nucleus (Fig. 2, A and C). Superimposing the images did not reveal any areas of co-localization. However, after camptothecin treatment, a significant amount of prohibitin could be observed outside the nucleus, in a similar staining pattern as cytochrome c. Overlay of these images revealed many areas of co-localization throughout the cytoplasm and in the perinuclear region, in both the cell lines tested (Fig. 2, B and D). These results suggested that prohibitin migrates to the mitochondria only when the cells are subjected to stress. Prohibitin Co-localizes with p53—The preceding experiments suggested that prohibitin underwent a signal-dependent translocation upon apoptotic signaling. Together with our previous results indicating that prohibitin has growth suppressive as well as anti-apoptotic properties, it seemed likely that prohibitin may be interacting with apoptotic proteins as well. Since proteins like DP1 and MDM2 interact with both E2F and p53, experiments were designed to examine whether prohibitin interacts with p53 as well. As a first step, a double immunofluorescence experiment was done on T47D and MCF-7 cells using an anti-prohibitin mouse monoclonal antibody and an anti-p53 rabbit polyconal antibody. Both prohibitin and p53 were predominantly nuclear in both the cell lines; upon superimposing the images, distinct yellow or white areas were observed in the nucleus where prohibitin co-localized with p53 (Fig. 3, A and C). This result suggested a potential physical interaction between these proteins. Though a certain amount of p53 was observed in the cytoplasm, there was minimal colocalization with prohibitin outside the nucleus. It was next examined how the interaction of prohibitin with p53 was affected by camptothecin treatment. Treatment with camptothecin led to prohibitin and p53 exiting the nucleus in both the cell lines tested (Fig. 3, B and D). Camptothecin-induced translocation of p53 to mitochondria has been reported earlier in agreement with our findings (32Marchenko N.D. Zaika A. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both prohibitin and p53 were found to concentrate in perinuclear regions, where they co-localized considerably. This result raised the possibility that prohibitin may be modulating apoptotic processes by affecting p53 function. The co-localization of prohibitin and p53 in T47D cells was examined 2, 4, and 8 h after camptothecin treatment (Fig. 4). It was found that in untreated cells and in the 2 h time point, prohibitin and p53 were found to co-localize in the nucleus (Fig. 4, A and B). After 4 h and 8 h of camptothecin treatment, majority of prohibitin and p53 were in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, C and D) suggesting that the nuclear exit occurs as the cells progress through the apoptotic process.Fig. 4Site of co-localization of prohibitin and p53 in the cell changes upon camptothecin treatment. T47D cells were stimulated with 30 μm camptothecin for 2, 4, or 8 h (B–D) and the localization of prohibitin and p53 detected as in Fig. 3. Yellow and white spots indicate areas of co-localization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Prohibitin and p53 Interact in Vivo—The co-localization of prohibitin with p53 raised the possibility that these two proteins are physically interacting with each other in the cell. This was examined by an immunoprecipitation-Western blot experiment. Cell lysates from MCF-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to p53; anti-HA antibody was used as a negative control and antibodies to E2F1 and Rb were positive controls. As shown in Fig. 5A, prohibitin could be detected by Western blotting in p53, E2F1, and Rb immunoprecipitates, but not in the HA immunoprecipitate. We had shown earlier that prohibitin associates with Rb and E2F1; this experiment shows that prohibitin can associate with p53 as well and the interaction can be observed without overexpressing any component. The time course of association with p53 was next examined. Lysates from MCF-7 cells treated with camptothecin for 4, 8, or 16 h were immunoprecipitated with a p53 antibody and the presence of prohibitin in the immunoprecipitates was examined. It was found that prohibitin could be detected in p53 immunoprecipitates of all four samples (Fig. 5B) suggesting that the magnitude of the interaction does not change significantly during the time points tested. It was next examined whether the two proteins interacted with each other in different compartments of the cell upon camptothecin treatment, as seen in the immunofluorescence experiment. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from control MCF-7 cells or those treated with camptothecin for 4 h and the interaction examined by immunoprecipitation-Western blot experiments. Both prohibitin and p53 were found in the nuclear extract of control cells, but in the cytoplasmic extract of camptothecin-treated cells (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5C, top panel, prohibitin could be observed in p53 immunoprecipitate from the nuclear extract of control cells, but not in the cytoplasmic extract. In contrast, it could be found only in the immunoprecipitate of the cytoplasmic extract from camptothecin-treated cells, not in nuclear extracts. The extracts were tested for cross-contamination by doing a Western blot for PARP, which is a nuclear protein; as shown in Fig. 5C, bottom panel, PARP could be detected only in the nuclear extracts. This experiment shows that though the magnitude of the interaction did not change significantly, the site of interaction in the cell was altered upon camptothecin treatment, in agreement with the co-localization studies. Attempts were then made to examine whether the changes in the localization of prohibitin and p53 correlated with induction of apoptosis by camptothecin. Toward this purpose, PARP cleavage was examined in lysates from MCF-7 cells treated with 30 μm camptothecin for different periods. This is because several convergent studies have shown that lysate protease activity characterized by PARP cleavage is a good marker for caspase activation. PARP cleavage could be observed as early as 4 h after camptothecin treatment (Fig. 5, C and D) indicating onset of apoptosis; significant amount of PARP cleavage was observed within 8 h. The nuclear exit of prohibitin and p53 thus appears to correlate with the onset of camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Prohibitin Interacts with p53 in Vitro—The finding that prohibitin co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated with p53 raised the possibility that these two proteins are interacting directly with each other. As an initial step to investigate this association, in vitro binding assays were performed. First, prohibitin protein was synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and incubated with glutathione S-transferase (GST) beads, or GST-p53 beads; GST-Rb was used as a positive control. The beads were washed extensively and the association of prohibitin was examined by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE. It was found that prohibitin bound to both the GST-p53 and GST-Rb beads efficiently, but there was no binding to the control GST beads (Fig. 6A). The binding was confirmed by performing the experiment in the opposite fashion: p53 protein was labeled with [35S]methionine in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and incubated with control GST or GST-prohibitin (GST-Phb) beads. It was found that p53 could bind to GST-Phb, but not to GST beads (Fig. 6B), which again suggested that these two proteins can interact in vitro. A modified in vitro binding assay was performed to confirm these interactions. GST or GST-Phb beads were incubated with a T47D breast carcinoma cell whole cell extract, and the binding of p53 was assessed by Western blot analysis following SDS-PAGE. p53 associated with GST-Phb beads, but not with GST beads (Fig. 6C, upper panel). To confirm the specificity of the interaction, the blot was stripped and re-probed for c-Myc, which does not bind prohibitin. c-Myc was present in the T47D whole cell extract, but did not bind to GST or GST-Phb beads (Fig. 6C, lower panel). These experiments confirm that p53 and prohibitin can interact in vivo as well as in vitro. Attempts were next made to determine the region of prohibitin, which associates with p53. Deletion fragments of prohibitin were used for this purpose in in vitro binding assays. In vitro synthesized prohibitin corresponding to residues 1–157 bound efficiently to GST-p53, whereas the region spanning residues 116–275 failed to bind (Fig. 6D). These results indicated that the N terminus of prohibitin contains the region necessary for binding to p53. Experiments were then designed to test the functional relevance of this interaction. Prohibitin Enhances p53 Transcriptional Activity—Since prohibitin was found to repress E2F1-mediated transcriptional activity via the recruitment of HDAC1 and N-CoR, experiments were next designed to examine whether proh"

Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins accelerate the deactivation of Galpha subunits to reduce GPCR signaling. Here we identified an RGS protein (AtRGS1) in Arabidopsis that has a predicted structure similar to a GPCR as well as an RGS box with GTPase accelerating activity. Expression of AtRGS1 complemented the pheromone supersensitivity phenotype of a yeast RGS mutant, sst2Delta. Loss of AtRGS1 increased the activity of the Arabidopsis Galpha subunit, resulting in increased cell elongation in hypocotyls in darkness and increased cell production in roots grown in light. These findings suggest that AtRGS1 is a critical modulator of plant cell proliferation."

Activation of PI 3-kinase by oxidative stress and its role in disruption of tight junctions was examined in Caco-2 cell monolayer. The oxidative stress-induced decrease in electrical resistance, increase in inulin permeability, and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 were reduced by a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. Oxidative stress-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and dissociation from the actin cytoskeleton of occludin and ZO-1 were reduced by LY294002.

The disruption of tight junctions plays an important role in the pathogenesis of a number of gastrointestinal diseases (1.Trier J.S. Sleisenger M. Fordstran J. Gastrointestinal Disease.

Studies reported during the past decade show that the tight junctions are composed of at least three types of transmembrane proteins, occludin (3.Anderson J.M. van Italie C.M. Am. J.

In the present study we examined the role of PI 3-kinase in the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junctions in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Results show that: 1) inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity reduces the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junctions; 2) oxidative stress increases the association of PI 3-kinase with occludin, and induces translocation of p85 to the intercellular junction; and 3) occludin interacts directly with p85. This study for the first time shows that PI 3-kinase is associated with occludin in Caco-2 cell monolayers, and plays an important role in the regulation of epithelial tight junctions by oxidative stress.

Cell Culture—Caco-2 and MDCK cells purchased from American Type Cell Collection (Rockville, MD) were grown under standard cell culture conditions as described previously (20.Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on polycarbonate membranes in transwells (6.5 mm, 12 mm, or 24 mm; Costar, Cambridge, MA), and experiments conducted on 11–13 days (6.5 or 12 mm transwells) or 17–19 days (24 mm transwell) after seeding. Treatment with Oxidative Stress—Oxidative stress was induced as previously described (20.Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (Dulbecco's saline containing 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.6% bovine serum albumin) in the absence or presence of a mixture of xanthine oxidase (20 milliunits/ml) and xanthine (0.25 mm) (XO+X) with or without LY294002 (25 μm). Control cell monolayers were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline without XO+X and inhibitors. Measurement of Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TER)—TER was measured as described previously (16.Rao R.K. Baker R.D. Baker S.S. Gupta A. Holycross M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G812-G823PubMed Google Scholar) using a Millicell-ERS electrical resistance system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). TER calculated as ohms/cm2 by multiplying it with the surface area of the monolayer. The resistance of the polycarbonate membrane in transwells (∼30 ohms/cm2) was subtracted from all readings. Unidirectional Flux of Inulin—Transwells with the cell monolayers were incubated under different experimental conditions in the presence of FITC-inulin (0.5 mg/ml) in the basal well. At different times after XO+X treatment, 100 μl each of apical and basal media were withdrawn, and fluorescence measured using a fluorescence plate reader (BioTEK Instruments, Winooski, VT). The flux into the apical well was calculated as the percent of total fluorescence administered into the basal well per hour per cm2 surface area. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—After treatment with XO+X in the absence or presence of LY294002 for varying times Caco-2 cell monolayers (12 mm) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1) at 0 °C for 5 min. Cell monolayers were blocked in 3% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 150 mm NaCl) and incubated for one hour with primary antibodies, rabbit polyclonal anti-occludin, mouse monoclonal anti-p85, and rat monoclonal anti-ZO-1 antibodies, followed by incubation for one hour with secondary antibodies, Oregon Green-conjugated anti-rat IgG, AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. The fluorescence was examined by a confocal laser scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC1024), and images from Z-series sections (1 μm) were collected by using comos (confocal microscope operating system). Images were stacked using the software, Confocal Assistant 4.02, and processed by Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Preparation of Cytoskeletal Fractions—Cell monolayers in transwell (24 mm) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 5 min with lysis buffer-CS (Tris buffer containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml bestatin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin-A, 1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were centrifuged at low speed 15,600 × g for 4 min at 4 °C to sediment the high-density actin cytoskeleton. The pellet was suspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer-CS. Protein contents in different fractions were measured by BCA method (Pierce Biotechnology Inc. (Rockford, IL). Cytoskeletal and Triton-soluble fractions were mixed with equal volumes of Laemmli's sample buffer (2× concentrated) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitation—After XO+X treatment for varying times Caco-2 cell monolayers (24 mm) were washed with ice-cold 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and actin cytoskeleton and Triton-soluble fraction were prepared. Actin suspension was sonicated for 10 s in lysis buffer-CS. Actin lysate and Triton-soluble fraction (1.0 mg protein/ml) were incubated with 2 μg of anti-occludin antibodies at 4 °C for 16 h. Immune complexes were isolated by precipitation using protein A-Sepharose (for 1 h at 4 °C). Washed beads were suspended in 20 μl of assay buffer to measure PI 3-kinase activity, or heated in Laemmli's sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. For tyrosine phosphorylation studies, cytoskeletal fractions were extracted in lysis buffer D (0.3% SDS in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm vanadate and 0.33 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. For co-immunoprecipitation of PI 3-kinase with occludin, cytoskeletal fractions were extracted in lysis buffer N (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% NP40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and cocktail of protease inhibitors as described above for lysis buffers-CS) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cytoskeletal extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of biotin-conjugated anti-Tyr(p) or 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-occludin antibodies. Immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight as described above. Immune complexes were precipitated by incubation for one hour with streptavidin-agarose or protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C. Anti-Tyr(p) immune complexes were immunoblotted for occludin and ZO-1. Anti-occludin immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for occludin and p85 or used for PI 3-kinase assay. Immunoblot analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4–12% gradient) electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes blotted for occludin, ZO-1, and p85 by using specific antibodies in combination with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. The blot was developed using ECL chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). PI 3-Kinase Assay—PI 3-kinase assay was carried out as described by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The occludin immune complexes were incubated in a 50 μl assay system consisting of 25 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 μg of phosphatidylinositol substrate (presonicated), and 150 μm ATP containing 10 μCi [γ-32]PATP. Reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction was stopped by the addition of two volumes of 6 m HCl in methanol. Lipids were extracted with chloroform and then separated by thin layer chromatography on calcium depleted, activated silica gel 60 (Whatman, Maidstone, England) using water/n-propanol/acetic acid (34:65:1, v/v/v) solvent system. TLC plates were exposed to x-ray films to determine the level of incorporation of 32P to substrate. Preparation of GST-C-Occludin and GST-p85—C-terminal tail of chicken occludin as a GST fusion protein, GST-C-occludin, and GST-p85 were prepared in Escherichia coli DH5α cells and purified using glutathione (GSH)-agarose as described previously (5.Martin-Padura L. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Feuscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). cDNA for C-terminal tail of occludin (amino acids 354–503) in pGEX vector was a gift from Dr. J. M. Anderson and A. Fanning, University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC), and the cDNA for p85 in pGEX vector was kindly provided by Dr. Marcello Arsura (Department of Pharmacology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN). Pair-wise Binding Assay—This particular assay detects binding between two individually purified proteins. For this purpose, we generated occludin and p85 as GST fusion proteins (e.g. GST-occludin C-tail, amino acids 354–503; and GST-p85, amino acids 1–724). The GST portion of GST-p85 was clipped off with thrombin. Binding assays were performed using GST-C-occludin and thrombin-cleaved p85, and excess glutathione-Sepharose beads was used to “pull down” the bound complex. Complexes were then immunoblotted for p85. This assay determines direct interaction between two proteins. PI 3-Kinase Activity Is Required for the Oxidative Stress-induced Disruption of Tight Junctions—To determine the role of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of tight junctions, the effect of the LY294002, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, on oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junctions was evaluated. Treatment of cell monolayers with XO+X resulted in a time-dependent decrease in TER (Fig. 1A) and increase in inulin permeability (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment of cell monolayers with LY294002 significantly reduced the XO+X-induced decrease in TER and increase in inulin permeability. The effect of LY294002 on XO+X-induced changes in TER and inulin permeability was concentration-dependent (Fig. 1, C and D). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that XO+X induced a redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 from the intercellular junctions (Fig. 2), which was prevented by pretreatment of cell monolayers with LY294002.Fig. 2Effect of LY294002 on oxidative stress-induced redistribution of occludin and ZO-1. Caco-2 cell monolayers were incubated without (Control) or with XO+X in the absence (XO+X) or presence of 25 μm LY294002 (XO+X + LY294002) for 2 h. Cell monolayers were fixed and stained for occludin and ZO-1 by immunofluorescence method. Confocal fluorescence images were collected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PI 3-Kinase Inhibitor Prevents Oxidative Stress-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Occludin and ZO-1 and Their Dissociation from the Actin Cytoskeleton—Previous studies (20.Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) showed that oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junctions in Caco-2 cell monolayers was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1 and their release from the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of LY294002 on XO+X-induced changes in tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeletal association of tight junction proteins. XO+X treatment resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1 in the actin cytoskeleton, the membrane cytoskeleton, and the Triton-soluble fractions. LY294002 reduced XO+X-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1 in all fractions (Fig. 3A). XO+X also induced a time-dependent reduction in the amounts of occludin and ZO-1 associated with the actin cytoskeleton, which was accompanied by an increase in occludin and ZO-1 in the Triton-soluble fraction (Fig. 3B). LY294002 reduced the XO+X-induced decrease in occludin and ZO-1 in the actin cytoskeleton and their increase in Triton-soluble fractions. LY294002 by itself produced no significant effect on cytoskeletal association or tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1 (data not shown). Oxidative Stress Induces a Rapid Activation of PI 3-Kinase— The above studies indicate that PI 3-kinase activity is required for the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junction. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of XO+X on the localization of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and PI 3-kinase activity in the cytoskeletal fractions. XO+X induced a rapid increase in the amount of PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit associated with the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane cytoskeleton, whereas it was reduced in Triton-soluble fractions (Fig. 4, A and B). XO+X also increased PI 3-kinase activity in the actin cytoskeleton with the maximal increase achieved at 15 min (Fig. 4, C and D). Activity in Triton-soluble fraction was slightly reduced at later time points. Oxidative Stress Increases Association of PI 3-Kinase with the Occludin—A previous study (23.Nusrat A. Chen J.A. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Tom J. Cromwell M. Quan C. Mrsny R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29816-29822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) raised the possibility of association of PI 3-kinase with the tight junction. To determine the interaction of PI 3-kinase with the tight junction complex in Caco-2 cell monolayers we evaluated co-immunoprecipitation of PI 3-kinase with occludin. A considerable amount of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, was co-immunoprecipitated with occludin precipitated from the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 5, A and B). The level of p85 co-immunoprecipitated with occludin was rapidly increased by XO+X treatment. Low levels of PI 3-kinase activity were detected in the immune complexes of occludin prepared from the resting epithelial actin cytoskeleton and Triton-soluble fraction (Fig. 5, C and D). Treatment with XO+X rapidly increased PI 3-kinase activity associated with the immune complexes of occludin prepared from both the actin cytoskeleton and the Triton-soluble fraction. Only trace amounts of PI 3-kinase activity were detected in the immune complexes of occludin prepared from the membrane cytoskeleton (data not shown). PI 3-kinase activity was dramatically low in immune complexes of occludin prepared from the cells treated with XO+X after pretreatment with LY294002 (Fig. 5, E and F). To determine the translocation of PI 3-kinase to the vicinity of tight junction we analyzed the effect of oxidative stress on localization of p85 by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. P85 was predominantly localized in the intracellular compartments at the apical part of the cell (Fig. 6). Treatment with XO+X induced a minor change in the localization of p85 at 5 min, but at 30 and 60 min after treatment p85 was predominantly localized at the intercellular junctions and co-localized with the occludin (Fig. 6). Direct Binding of p85 with Occludin—To determine the direct interaction of C-terminal tail of occludin with p85 we generated recombinant GST-fused C-occludin (C-terminal 150 amino acids) and GST-p85. GST-p85 was cleaved with thrombin, and p85 was incubated with varying concentrations of GST-C-occludin. GST pull-down assay showed that recombinant p85 binds C-occludin in a concentration-related manner (Fig. 7). GST alone showed only a minimal binding to p85. Oxidative Stress Increases Paracellular Permeability in MDCK Cell Monolayer by a PI 3-Kinase-dependent Mechanism—To demonstrate the PI 3-kinase-mediated regulation of tight junction in another epithelial model we evaluated the effect of LY294002 on oxidative stress-induced increase in permeability in MDCK cell monolayers. Incubation of MDCK cell monolayers with XO+X decreased TER (Fig. 8A) and increased inulin flux (Fig. 8B) in a time-dependent manner. This increase in paracellular permeability was associated with reorganization of occludin and ZO-1 from the intercellular junctions (Fig. 8C). Pretreatment of cell monolayers with LY294002 significantly reduced XO+X-induced decrease in TER, increase in inulin permeability and reorganization of occludin and ZO-1 (Fig. 8). Oxidative stress disrupts tight junction- and adherens junction-based cell-cell adhesion in Caco-2 cell monolayer by a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism (20.Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The oxidative stress-induced disruption of the tight junction and the adherens junction is associated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. Recent studies (21.Basuroy S. Sheth P. Kuppuswamy D. Balasubramanian S. Ray R.M. Rao R.K. (2003).J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11916-11924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oxidative stress induces a rapid activation of c-Src, and that c-Src activity is required for the oxidative stress-induced disruption of the tight junction. The present study shows that oxidative stress increases the level of PI 3-kinase associated with the occludin and that PI 3-kinase activity mediates the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junctions in Caco-2 cell monolayers. This is the first evidence for the association of PI 3-kinase with a tight junction protein, and for the role of PI 3-kinase activity in the disruption of epithelial tight junctions. On the contrary a previous study (25.Woo P.L. Ching D. Guan Y. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32818-32828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed that PI 3-kinase activity is required for dexamethasone-induced increase in transepithelial resistance. A significant reduction of oxidative stress-induced decrease in TER, increase in inulin permeability, and redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 by LY294002 indicate that PI 3-kinase activity plays an important role in the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junction in Caco-2 cell monolayer. Previous studies demonstrated that occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin undergo rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine residues during the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junctions (20.Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and that tyrosine phosphorylation reduces the interactions between occludin and ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (26.Kale G. Naren A.P. Sheth P. Rao R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The present study shows that LY294002 reduces oxidative stress-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin and ZO-1. Previous studies (20.Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that occludin and ZO-1 bound to actin cytoskeleton correlates well with the barrier function of the epithelium. Disruption of tight junctions by oxidative stress reduces the amounts of occludin and ZO-1 bound to the actin cytoskeleton, which was prevented by genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The present study shows that LY294002 also reduces the oxidative stress-induced dissociation of occludin and ZO-1 from the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, PI 3-kinase activity is required for the oxidative stress-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and dissociation from the actin cytoskeleton of tight junction proteins, and therefore for the disruption of tight junctions. However, the temporal relationship between oxidative stress effect on tyrosine phosphorylation, release from the actin cytoskeleton, and disruption of tight junction is not clear. Significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and release of occludin from the actin cytoskeleton occurred by 60 min, whereas less than 20% of TER was reduced. It is likely that mechanisms downstream to activation of PI 3-kinase and c-Src and other lateral mechanisms are involved in oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junction. The fast migrating occludin bands that appeared in oxidative stress-treated cells (Fig. 3) are likely a result of proteolytic degradation of occludin. In our previous study (20.Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) we showed that oxidative stress induces proteolytic degradation of occludin, and the low molecular weight degradation products are predominantly present in MCS and TS fractions. The metallo-proteinase inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline, significantly reduced the oxidative stress-induced degradation of occludin. However, this inhibitor did not prevent oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junction, and therefore occludin degradation was considered uninvolved in oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junction and increase in permeability. Additionally, genistein prevented oxidative stress-induced increase in permeability without an effect on occludin degradation. Similarly, the present study shows that LY294002 reduces oxidative stress-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of occludin (Fig. 3A) with no effect on proteolytic degradation of occludin (Fig. 3B). The requirement of PI 3-kinase activity in the regulation of tight junction, and the previous in vitro study that raised the possibility of interaction between the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and the C-terminal sequence of occludin (23.Nusrat A. Chen J.A. Foley C.S. Liang T.W. Tom J. Cromwell M. Quan C. Mrsny R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29816-29822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) suggest that PI 3-kinase may be associated with the tight junction complex in Caco-2 cells, and that oxidative stress may alter this interaction. The present study shows that the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and the PI 3-kinase activity are associated with the immune complexes of occludin prepared from the actin cytoskeleton of the resting epithelium. Oxidative stress rapidly increases the level of regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and the PI 3-kinase activity in the immune complexes of occludin. These results demonstrate that PI 3-kinase does interact with tight junction complex, and it can be increased by physiologic or pathophysiologic conditions such as oxidative stress. This observation was further confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence localization of p85 at the junctions. Oxidative stress increased the localization of p85 at the intercellular junctions, with a concomitant decrease in p85 stain at the intracellular compartments. Double staining for p85 and occludin indicates that p85 is co-localized with occludin. At 5 min of XO+X treatment the PI 3-kinase activity associated with occludin was found to be higher than control in both ACS and TS fraction, suggesting an activation of PI 3-kinase at the early time period. Therefore, it is possible that the initial effect of oxidative stress is activation of PI 3-kinase bound to occludin, which was immediately followed by a translocation of PI 3-kinase into occludin. The binding of PI 3-kinase to occludin does not necessarily mean that it is associated with the tight junction. However, our previous study (20.Rao R.K. Basuroy S. Rao V.U. Karnaky K.J. Gupta A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) showed that oxidative stress-induced increase in paracellular permeability and its reduction by genistein correlated well with the changes in the levels of actin-bound occludin. Changes in occludin present in MCS fraction or TS fraction did not correlate with the permeability changes, which indicated that actin-bound occludin is the pool of occludin that is most relevant t the tight junctions. Therefore, it is likely that PI 3-kinase activity present in occludin immunoprecipitates prepared from the ACS fraction is associated with the tight junction. The rapid increase in the activity of PI 3-kinase in the tight junctions strongly indicates that this pool of PI 3-kinase plays a crucial role in the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junctions. However, it is not clear if the co-immunoprecipitation of p85 with occludin is a direct interaction. As immune complexes of occludin prepared under native conditions are expected to co-precipitate many of the tight junction proteins, it is possible that PI 3-kinase interacts indirectly with the occludin through other proteins. Therefore, we investigated the direct interaction of occludin with p85 by GST pull-down assays using GST-C-occludin and thrombin-cleaved GST-p85. Concentration-related binding of recombinant p85 with recombinant GST-C-occludin demonstrates that p85 directly interacts with the C-terminal tail of occludin. These studies suggest a possibility of direct interaction of p85 with occludin within the cell, and that this interaction is enhanced by oxidative stress. Such an enhancement of interaction between p85 and occludin may involve post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. In summary, this study shows that oxidative stress increases the association of PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit and PI 3-kinase activity with the tight junction protein complex, and that PI 3-kinase activity is required for the oxidative stress-induced disruption of tight junctions."

Consistent with the funneling percept, we show with optical imaging in area 3b of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) that simultaneous stimulation of two fingertips produces a single focal cortical activation between the single fingertip activation regions. Thus, in contrast to traditional views of the body map, topographic representation in the SI reflects the perceived rather than the physical location of peripheral stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2114592600,"Flows of complex fluids need to be understood at both macroscopic and molecular scales, because it is the macroscopic response that controls the fluid behavior, but the molecular scale that ultimately gives rise to rheological and solid-state properties. Here the flow field of an entangled polymer melt through an extended contraction, typical of many polymer processes, is imaged optically and by small-angle neutron scattering. The dual-probe technique samples both the macroscopic stress field in the flow and the microscopic configuration of the polymer molecules at selected points. The results are compared with a recent “tube model” molecular theory of entangled melt flow that is able to calculate both the stress and the single-chain structure factor from first principles. The combined action of the three fundamental entangled processes of reptation, contour length fluctuation, and convective constraint release is essential to account quantitatively for the rich rheological behavior. The multiscale approach unearths a new feature: Orientation at the length scale of the entire chain decays considerably more slowly than at the smaller entanglement length."
https://openalex.org/W2023413594,"Erythrocytic mechanisms involved in malarial infection are poorly understood. We have found that signaling via the erythrocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor and heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Galphas) regulated the entry of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Agonists that stimulate cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production led to an increase in malarial infection that could be blocked by specific receptor antagonists. Moreover, peptides designed to inhibit Galphas protein function reduced parasitemia in P. falciparum cultures in vitro, and beta-antagonists reduced parasitemia of P. berghei infections in an in vivo mouse model. Thus, signaling via the erythrocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor and Galphas may regulate malarial infection across parasite species."

Whereas the object could appear shifted in the direction of the visual motion, the representation of the object in the visual cortex was always shifted in the opposite direction. The results show that the representation of position in the primary visual cortex, as revealed by fMRI, can be dissociated from perceived location."

We report here on the characterization of a novel vertebrate C-P4H α-subunit, α(III), from human, rat, and mouse tissues. The amino acid sequence of the human α(III)-subunit is 35–37% identical to those of the human α(I) and α(II) subunits, and its mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues, but at much lower levels than the α(I) and α(II) mRNAs. Coexpression of recombinant α(III) and PDI polypeptides in human embryonic kidney cells led to the formation of an active enzyme that hydroxylated collagen chains and a collagen-like peptide and appeared to be an [α(III)]2β2 tetramer. Isolation of cDNA Clones—PCR primers 1-α(III) (5′-GTTAGGAATGCAGCACTGTTT-3′) and 2-α(III) (5-GCTGGAGCTGCAGGGTCT-3′) were used to obtain a 162-bp product from a Human Fetal Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences), which was then used to screen a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) lambda cDNA library (Stratagene), 13 positive clones being obtained. The human α(III) cDNA was also analyzed by consecutive overlapping 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions in a Marathon-Ready human total fetal cDNA pool (BD Biosciences), and its 5′-end was obtained by 5′-RACE of HUVEC cDNA using Advantage-GC 2 polymerase (BD Biosciences). HUVEC cDNA was generated using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences), and total RNA isolated from cultured HUVEC cells with the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen). The full-length human α(III) cDNA was cloned into pUC18 in two steps. An α(III) fragment extending from nucleotide 184 to the poly(A) tail was first cloned into pUC18 using the SureClone ligation kit (Amersham Biosciences), after which this construct was digested with BamHI-ApaI and a similarly digested α(III) fragment covering bp 1–418 was ligated to it. The rat and mouse α(III) cDNAs were assembled by consecutive overlapping 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions using various rat and mouse Marathon-Ready cDNA pools (BD Biosciences) as templates and initial 5′- and 3′-RACE primers based on a 169 bp rat sequence (GenBank™ accession number AW921407). DNA sequencing was performed on ABI Prism 377 (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology comparisons were made using the ClustalW service at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Analysis of the Expression of Human α(III) Subunit mRNA—Human MTN Blot (BD Clontech) and Real™ Human Fetal mRNA Blot I and II (Invitrogen) containing 2 μg poly(A)+ RNA per lane were hybridized using ULTRAhyb™ solution under the conditions specified by the manufacturer, with 0.5 μg of a 2250-bp α(III) or a 1440-bp α(I) cDNA fragment as the probe, the blots being exposed for 72 and 4 h, respectively. PCR analysis of the Human MTC Panel I and Human Fetal MTC Panel (BD Clontech) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with the primer pairs α(I)panel-5′ (GAAGGCGAGATTTCTACCATAGATAAAGTC) and α(I)panel-3′ (CCTTGTACGTTGTCAGAATTGGAATGAC), and α(III)panel-5′ (GACATGGGGGATTATTACCATGCCATTC) and α(III)panel-3′ (ACCCAAAACTGGTGACCCTCAACCAC). The amounts of the α(I) and α(III) primers were optimized prior to the analyses to produce similar amounts of DNA from equal amounts of the α(I) and α(III) plasmids under the same PCR conditions. The preincubation was at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 26, 30, 34, 38, and 42 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min, 5-μl aliquots being taken at each point and analyzed on 1% agarose gels. Total RNA from human fetal epiphyseal cartilage was a gift from Dr. E. Vuorio, University of Turku, Finland, while total RNA from human fibroblasts (N-09) was isolated using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Clontech), and PCR analysis as for the MTC panels, using the α(I) and α(III) primers described above and the α(II) primers α(II)panel-5′ (GAGGAGGCCACCACAACCAAGTCA) and α(II)panel-3′ (GACCTTGTGGATCAACAGAAGTTGACTG). Alternative splicing of the α(III) mRNA was analyzed by PCR with various human MTC panel and Marathon-Ready cDNAs (BD Biosciences) as templates. The primer pairs used were α(III)-17 (CTGCGGGACCTGACTAGATTCTAC), spanning the boundary between exons 1 and 2, and α(III)r7 (GTGGTTGACGGTCACGACTTTTGGGT) from exon 9, and α(III)-20 (CCTCTACTGTTCCTATGAGACCAATT) from exon 7 and α(III)-2 (GCTGGAGCTGCAGGGTCT) from exon 13. Expression and Analysis of a Recombinant α(III) Polypeptide in Insect and Mammalian Cells—The full-length human α(III) cDNA was cut into two pieces from pUC18 with BamHI-EcoRI digestion and cloned into a similarly digested baculovirus vector pVL1393 (BD Pharmingen). The α(III) cDNA lacking sequences coding for the signal peptide was generated by PCR and cloned into pACGP67A (BD Pharmingen) in-frame with the GP67 signal sequence. The recombinant baculoviruses were generated and the Sf9 and High Five insect cells were coinfected with viruses encoding the α(III) and PDI polypeptides and analyzed as described previously (17Myllyharju J.

A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors were generated by cloning the full-length PDI cDNA into pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and the full-length α(III) and α(I) cDNAs into pCDNA3.1(+)Hygro vectors (Invitrogen). The pCDNA3.1(+)PDI construct was linearized with BglII, transfected into human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells using PolyFect (Qiagen), and stably transfected cells were selected with 400 μg/ml of Geneticin (Invitrogen). The HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (BioClear) and 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid at 37 °C. The pCDNA3.1(+)Hygro vectors encoding the α(III) and α(I) polypeptides were linearized with BglII and FspI, respectively, transfected into the stable HEK-293 cell line expressing recombinant human PDI, and stable cell lines were selected with 25 μg/ml of hygromycin (Invitrogen). A control cell line was established by stable transfection of pCDNA3.1(+)HygroLacZ (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested at confluency and homogenized in a Triton X-100 buffer (17Myllyharju J.

Soluble and insoluble fractions of the insect and mammalian cell homogenates were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and 8% nondenaturing PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting with a PDI antibody 5B5 (Dako), a polyclonal α(I) antibody K17 (19Veijola J.

Harlow E. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 90-91Google Scholar). P4H activity was assayed by methods based on the formation of 4-hydroxy[14C]proline in a [14C]proline-labeled substrate consisting of nonhydroxylated procollagen polypeptide chains or the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (21Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Km and Ki values were determined as described (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Native immunoprecipitation was performed with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The cell lysates were precleared, immunoprecipitated with 1–5 μg of the antibodies VTT1081 against the α(III) subunit or anti-FLAG (Sigma) as a negative control, and the Sepharose and the bound antibody-protein complexes were washed three times with a Triton X-100 buffer (17Myllyharju J.

N-glycosidase F treatment was carried out according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Gel filtration was performed in a calibrated Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant human type I and II C-P4Hs were expressed in insect cells, and the type I enzyme was purified as described (6Annunen P. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Veijola J. Pihlajaniemi T.

Cloning of the Human, Rat, and Mouse α(III) Subunits—A sequence homology search identified several human ESTs representing a gene product with similarity to the conserved C-terminal regions of the C-P4H α(I) and α(II) subunits. EST AA116081 was used to design primers for the initial 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions and amplification of a 162-bp probe, which was then used to screen a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library, the 5′-end of the cDNA being obtained by 5′-RACE reactions. The cDNA clones cover 43 bp of the 5′-untranslated sequence, a 1635-bp open reading frame, and 591 bp of the 3′-untranslated sequence, with a canonical polyadenylation signal ATTAAA followed 15-bp downstream by a poly(A) tail. A sequence homology search with the human α(III) cDNA identified a 169-bp rat sequence that is 89% identical to the coding nucleotides at the 3′-end of the human sequence. The rat sequence information was used to design primers for 5′-RACE reactions in rat cDNA pools, and 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions in mouse cDNA pools. The cDNA fragments obtained cover the full-length coding sequences of the rat and mouse α(III) subunit cDNAs, including 25 and 13 bp of the 5′-untranslated region, respectively. The human, rat, and mouse α(III) cDNA sequences have been deposited in the GenBank™ with accession numbers AY313448, AY313450, and AY313449, respectively. Amino Acid Sequences of the Human, Rat, and Mouse α(III) Subunits—The human and rat α(III) cDNAs encode polypeptides of 544 amino acids, the mouse polypeptide being two residues shorter. Putative signal peptides (22Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) of 19, 19, and 22 residues are present in the N termini of the human, rat, and mouse α(III) polypeptides, respectively, the lengths of the processed human and rat α(III) subunits thus being 525 amino acids and that of the mouse α(III) 520 amino acids (Fig. 1). The processed human α(III) subunit is slightly longer than the processed human α(I) and α(II), which consist of 517 and 514 residues, respectively (4Helaakoski T. Vuori K. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I.

The human α(III) sequence shows 91 and 94% identity to the rat and mouse sequences, respectively, the latter two being 95% identical. The overall sequence identity between the processed human α(III) and α(I) subunits is 35%, and that between α(III) and α(II) 37% (Fig. 1), while the identity between α(I) and α(II) is higher, 65%. The identity is highest within the catalytically important C-terminal region (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol.

All four critical residues at the catalytic site, the two histidines and one aspartate that bind the Fe2+ atom and the lysine that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate in position +10 with respect to the second iron-binding histidine (1Kivirikko K.I.

The residue that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of 2-oxoglutarate in the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase (FIH) is also a lysine, but it is present in position +15 with respect to the first iron-binding histidine (23Elkins J.M.

Furthermore, a fifth critical residue, a histidine that is probably involved in the binding of the C-1 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate to the Fe2+ atom and the decarboxylation of this cosubstrate (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), is likewise conserved in all the C-P4H α-subunits (Fig. 1). The peptide-substrate binding domain of the C-P4Hs is distinct from the catalytic domain and is located between Phe-144 and Ser-244 in the human α(I) subunit (27Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Hieta R. Kukkola L. Permi P. Pirilä P. Kivirikko K.I. Kilpeläinen I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34966-34974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent NMR studies have shown that this domain is composed of five α helices that can also be accurately predicted (29Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on amino acid sequence (28Hieta R. Kukkola L. Permi P. Pirilä P. Kivirikko K.I. Kilpeläinen I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34966-34974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between the human α(I) peptide-binding domain and the corresponding regions of the human α(II) and α(III) subunits is 57 and 35%, respectively, while that between the α(II) and α(III) polypeptides is 34%. However, all five α helices can be predicted (29Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be located in identical positions in all three polypeptides and to be identical in length, the only exception being the slightly shorter fifth helix in the α(III) polypeptide (Fig. 1). It thus seems probable that the structures of the peptide-binding domains of all three α-subunits are highly similar despite their relatively low overall amino acid sequence identity. Detailed studies to verify this aspect would nevertheless require comparison of the crystal-based structures of complexes of the three domains with a peptide substrate, which is clearly beyond the scope of this study. Expression of the α(III) Subunit mRNA in Various Human Tissues—Expression of the α(III) and α(I) subunit mRNAs was studied by Northern hybridization, the blots being exposed for 72 or 4 h, respectively. The α(III) mRNA was found to be about 2.7 kb in size, whereas the α(I) mRNA is about 3.0 kb (Fig. 2A). The highest α(III) mRNA expression levels were found in the placenta, adult liver, and fetal skin, low levels being detected in the fetal liver, lung and muscle (Fig. 2A). However, as exposure times shorter than 72 h produced no visible bands with the α(III) probe, the relative expression levels of this mRNA must be much lower than those of the α(I) mRNA in all the tissues studied. Expression of the α(III) mRNA was studied further by PCR analysis of human multitissue cDNA panels under conditions that produced similar amounts of DNA from equal amounts of α(III) and α(I) plasmids. The highest α(III) mRNA expression levels were seen in the placenta and fetal kidney, liver and lung (Fig. 2B). The expression levels of the α(III) mRNA were again much lower than those of the α(I) mRNA in all the tissues studied, since no α(III) mRNA was detected in these samples after 34 cycles, whereas the α(I) mRNA was already clearly seen in many tissues after 30 cycles (Fig. 2B).

An exceptionally complete skeleton of Phoberomys pattersoni was discovered in a rich locality of fossil vertebrates in the Upper Miocene of Venezuela. Reliable body mass estimates yield approximately 700 kilograms, more than 10 times the mass of the largest living rodent, the capybara. With Phoberomys, Rodentia becomes one of the mammalian orders with the largest size range, second only to diprotodontian marsupials. Several postcranial features support an evolutionary relationship of Phoberomys with pakaranas from the South American rodent radiation.

A study of the suspended soils of spatially discrete epiphytes or treetop ""islands"" in the canopies of New Zealand rainforest trees revealed that different components of the decomposer community responded either positively or negatively to island size, as well as to the tree species that the islands occurred in. This in turn led to important differences between islands in the rates of ecosystem processes driven by the decomposer biota. This system serves as a model for better understanding how attributes of both real and habitat islands may affect key ecosystem functions through determining the community structure of organisms that drive these functions."
https://openalex.org/W2109640441,"Isoproterenol challenge of Hek-B2 cells causes a transient recruitment of the endogenous PDE4D isoforms found in these cells, namely PDE4D3 and PDE4D5, to the membrane fraction. PDE4D5 provides around 80% of the total PDE4D protein so recruited, although it only comprises about 40% of the total PDE4D protein in Hek-B2 cells. PDE4D5 provides about 80% of the total PDE4D protein found associated with β-arrestins immunopurified from Hek-B2, COS1, and A549 cells as well as cardiac myocytes, whereas its overall level in these cells is between 15 and 50% of the total PDE4D protein. Truncation analyses indicate that two sites in PDE4D5 are involved in mediating its interaction with β-arrestins, one associated with the common PDE4 catalytic region and the other located within its unique amino-terminal region. Truncation analyses indicate that two sites in β-arrestin 2 are involved in mediating its interaction with PDE4D5, one associated with its extreme amino-terminal region and the other located within the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein. We suggest that the unique amino-terminal region of PDE4D5 allows it to preferentially interact with β-arrestins. This specificity appears likely to account for the preferential recruitment of PDE4D5, compared with PDE4D3, to membranes of Hek-B2 cells and cardiac myocytes upon challenge with isoproterenol.

It is now well established that the rapid uncoupling of this response is achieved by the action of the G-protein receptorcoupled kinase 2 (2.Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal tail of the plasma membrane-associated β2AR, allowing the recruitment of β-arrestins from the cytosol (5.Brady A.E. Limbird L.E.

It is this recruitment of β-arrestin, rather than phosphorylation per se, that elicits uncoupling, presumably by sterically blocking coupling of the β2AR to Gs. The importance of β-arrestin interaction to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in vivo has been clearly established in knockout mouse models (8.Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K.

Since they provide the sole route for degradation of cAMP in cells, they are poised to play a key role in controlling cAMP signaling. Multiple genes encode a large superfamily of PDEs, which differ in their regulatory and kinetic properties. Of these, the PDE4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase family (13.Houslay M.D. Prog.

The PDE4 enzyme family is encoded by four genes (PDE4A, -B, -C, and -D), which generate over 16 different isoforms through the use of distinct promoters and alternative mRNA splicing (12.Conti M.

The various PDE4 isoforms, which often have very different patterns of expression in tissues, are each characterized by a unique amino-terminal region. The amino-terminal regions of each of the various PDE4 isoforms have been shown to be involved, in a number of instances, in determining their intracellular targeting and interaction with other proteins. The four PDE4 subfamilies can each be divided into the so-called long isoforms, which possess both the upstream conserved region 1 (UCR1) and upstream conserved region (UCR2) regulatory modules (22.Bolger G.

Recently, a new feature of the G-protein receptor-coupled kinase/β-arrestin desensitization system, associated with the β2AR, has been demonstrated. Both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 have been shown to bind to PDE4 isoforms from all four subfamilies (25.Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E. McLean A.J. Conti M. Houslay M.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This interaction allows β-arrestin to cause an agonist-dependent increase in cAMP degradation in the environs of the β2AR, by recruiting PDE4 isoforms to the β2AR. The recruited PDE4 appears able to regulate the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase at the plasma membrane and thereby regulate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation status of the β2AR itself (25.Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E. McLean A.J. Conti M. Houslay M.D. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Through this action, the recruited PDE4 serves to regulate the ability of the β2AR to switch between activation of adenylyl cyclase through Gs and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase through Gi (26.Baillie G.S. Sood A. McPhee I. Gall I. Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Houslay M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The long PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 isoforms, which differ only in having different unique amino-terminal regions, provide the major PDE4 activity in many cell types. Here we show that PDE4D5 is preferentially recruited over PDE4D3 for interaction with β-arrestins and suggest that this difference is attributable to a subregion found within the isoform-specific amino-terminal region of PDE4D5.

Transfection of Hek293 cells, Hek-B2 cells, and COS1 cells was done using Polyfect (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane Recruitment of PDE4D Isoforms—Hek-B2 cells were stimulated with isoproterenol (10 μm) for the indicated times before being washed three times in ice-cold KHEM buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, 1.92 mm MgCl2). Cells were then harvested and homogenized before being centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 10 min to yield low speed pellet (P1) and supernatant (S1) fractions. The S1 fraction was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to yield a high speed supernatant (S2) and pellet (P2) fraction. Membrane fractions were then washed in KHEM buffer to remove any supernatant. 50 μg of membrane protein from each time point was run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with a monoclonal PDE4D-specific antibody (27.Bolger G.B.

Immunoprecipitation Studies to Evaluate the Interaction of Endogenous β-Arrestin and PDE4D Isoforms in Various Cell Types—Cells were washed in KHEM buffer, harvested, homogenized, and fractionated as described above. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous β-arrestin was done by preclearing the S2 fraction (500-μg protein) with 50 μl of KHEM-washed protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) before the addition of either 5 μl of polyclonal antibody against β-arrestin (A1CT) (25.Perry S.J.

The tubes were incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing for 1 h before the addition of 50 μl of protein A beads. The tubes were mixed for a further 2 h at 4 °C before the beads were pelleted at 1,300 × g for 3 min. The beads were washed three times in KHEM buffer before being boiled in Laemmli buffer (36.Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed.

The immunoprecipitates and lysate (one-twentieth total lysate) were run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the PDE4D monoclonal antibody. Each experiment was carried out on three separate occasions, and the amount of PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 that co-immunoprecipitated with β-arrestin was quantified by densitometry. Immunoprecipitation Studies to Evaluate the Interaction between Recombinant β-Arrestin 2 and PDE4D5 Constructs in Transfected Cells—Hek293 or COS1 cells were co-transfected with one of the following β-arrestin 2 constructs: pcDNA3NARB2FLAG, encoding wild type, carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged β-arrestin 2 or various derivatives of this plasmid that encode truncations or “point” β-arrestin 2 mutants plus one of the following PDE4D constructs: 1) pCIneo-PDE4D3, encoding wild type, carboxyl-terminal VSV-tagged PDE4D3; 2) pcDNAPDE4D5VSV, encoding wild type, VSV-tagged PDE4D5; or 3) various pcDNA3 constructs encoding VSV-tagged, amino-terminal truncated forms of PDE4D5, as described previously by us (32.Yarwood S.J.

However, to ensure that the ratio of the expression of PDE4D5-VSV and β-arrestin 2-FLAG were similar in each cell preparation, we performed parallel transfections in which we varied the amount of plasmid DNA (for both PDE4D5-VSV and β-arrestin 2-FLAG) transfected into the cells. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed with 10 strokes of a 26½-gauge needle in 500 μl of KHEM buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The expression of PDE4D5-VSV and β-arrestin 2-FLAG in each preparation was monitored by immunoblotting with an anti-VSV monoclonal antibody or the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (both from Sigma), and densitometry was used to compare VSV or FLAG immunoreactivity. Cell lysates that contained expression ratios that were equal to or up to 10% greater than the control were selected for immunoprecipitations. For the immunoprecipitations, a volume of each lysate calculated to contain an equal amount of VSV immunoreactive material was then incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h with end-over-end mixing at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in KHEM buffer plus 0.05% Igepal detergent (Sigma). Protein complexes were released by boiling the beads in Laemmli buffer, and the co-immunoprecipitation of transfected PDE4s with β-arrestin 2-FLAG was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-VSV monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG antibody. Expression of Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli—For bacterial expression of PDE4D5, full-length PDE4D5 was cloned into pMALc2 (New England Biolabs) to generate pMALPDE4D5, which expresses MBP-PDE4D5, a fusion between maltose-binding protein (MBP) and PDE4D5 (32.Yarwood S.J.

Full-length human β-arrestin 1 was cloned into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate pGEX-ARB1, which expresses GST-ARB1, a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and β-arrestin 1. Full-length β-arrestin 1 was cloned into pET15b (Novagen) to generate pETARB1, which expresses β-arrestin 1 with hexahistidine fused to its carboxyl-terminal end (His-ARB1). Cultures of E. coli BL21star cells (Invitrogen) containing pMALPDE4D5, pETARB1, pGEX-ARB1, or pGEX-5X-3 were grown to an A600 of 0.6 and then induced with 0.2–1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) and grown for a further 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the bacterial pellets were frozen at –80 °C overnight. His-ARB1 was purified from bacteria expressing pETARB1 using His-Bind Quick Columns (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To purify the other recombinant proteins, the remaining pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold resuspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated 4 × 30 s on ice. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.02%, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was incubated with one-tenth volume of pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for GST fusions or amylose resin (New England BioLabs) for MBP fusions for 1 h end-over-end at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 1 min and washed three times with resuspension buffer. The fusion proteins were eluted by the addition of 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for GST fusions or 10 mm maltose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for MBP fusions. The fusion proteins were dialyzed three times against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol and then stored at –80 °C until required. PDE Assays—PDE activity was assayed as described previously (38.Marchmont R.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 39.Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M.

The addition of 1.2 nm MBP-PDE4D5 was shown to result in PDE activity within the linear range using 1 μm cAMP substrate. 1.2 nm MBP-PDE4D5 was then assayed in the presence of His-ARB1, GST-ARB1, or GST alone at concentrations of 0.3, 3.0, 30, and 300 nm. The effect of adding boiled, denatured fusion proteins was also tested as a control. Determination of the Relative Activity of Endogenous PDE4 Subfamilies in HEK-B2 Cells—The PDE activity of the cell lysates was measured at 1 μm cAMP to give total cAMP PDE activity and also in the presence of 10 μm rolipram to measure total PDE4 activity in the lysate. The relative contributions of the isoforms from each of the four PDE4 subfamilies (PDE4A, -B, -C, and -D, respectively) was determined by immunopurifying them with subfamily-specific monoclonal antibodies (ICOS Corp.). These antibodies are directed against the carboxyl-terminal regions that are conserved within the members of each subfamily but differ between the members of different subfamilies (12.Conti M.

Protein G-agarose beads (50 μl; Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, centrifuged for 1,000 × g for 3 min, washed three times in KHEM buffer, and then assayed for PDE4 activity as described above. In parallel experiments, we determined that no PDE4 activity was associated nonspecifically with the beads when no PDE4 antibody was added.

All mutagenesis and deletion constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to use. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—8% acrylamide gels were used, and the samples were boiled for 5 min after being resuspended in Laemmli buffer (36.Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 685Google Scholar). Gels were run at 8 mA/gel overnight or 50 mA/gel for 4–5 h with cooling. For detection of recombinant PDEs by immunoblotting, 2–50-μg protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using the indicated specific antisera. Labeled bands were identified using peroxidase linked to either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, and the Amersham Biosciences ECL immunoblotting kit was used for visualization. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographs and PhosphorImager plates was used for quantitation.

https://openalex.org/W2147350157,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent phospholipid mediator involved in various disease states such as allergic asthma, atherosclerosis and psoriasis. The human PAF receptor (PAFR) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family. Following PAF stimulation, cells become rapidly desensitized; this refractory state can be maintained for hours and is dependent on PAFR phosphorylation, internalization, and down-regulation. In this report, we characterized ligand-induced, long term PAFR desensitization, and pathways leading to its degradation. Some GPCRs are known to be targeted to proteasomes for degradation while others traffic via the early/late endosomes toward lysosomes. Specific inhibitors of lysosomal proteases and inhibitors of the proteasome were effective in reducing the ligand-induced PAFR down-regulation by 40 and 25%, respectively, indicating the importance of receptor targeting to both lysosomes and proteasomes in long term cell desensitization to PAF. The effects of the proteasome and lysosomal protease inhibitors were additive and, together, completely blocked ligand-induced degradation of PAFR. Using dominant-negative Rab5 and 7 and colocalization of the PAFR with the early endosome autoantigen I (EEAI) or transferrin, we confirmed that ligand-induced PAFR down-regulation was Rab5/7-dependent and involved lysosomal degradation. In addition, we also demonstrated that PAFR was ubiquitinated in an agonist-independent manner. However, a dominant negative ubiquitin ligase (NCbl) reduced PAFR ubiquitination and inhibited ligand-induced but not basal receptor degradation. Our results indicate that PAFR degradation can occur via both the proteasome and lysosomal pathways and ligand-stimulated degradation is ubiquitin-dependent.

Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 41-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). PAF structural requirements are highly specific for its biological actions, which are mediated through the binding and activation of a specific, high affinity PAF receptor (PAFR) on the target cell surface. cDNA cloning from various sources revealed that PAFR belongs to the G-protein coupled receptors family (GPCR) and its signaling is linked to various second messenger systems, including phospholipase A2, C, and D activation (3Nakamura M.

Transgenic mice, which overexpress PAFR spontaneously develop melanocyte tumors and a severe response to lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxin shock. With their enhanced sensitivity to PAF, they also demonstrate bronchial hyperresponsiveness and have problems with fertilization (14Ishii S. Nagase T. Tashiro F. Ikuta K. Sato S. Waga I. Kume K.

The attenuation of GPCR signaling, after stimulation, is known as desensitization and involves several distinct mechanisms. Within seconds after agonist binding, GPCRs become functionally uncoupled from G proteins and rapidly phosphorylated by different kinases. The receptors then undergo endocytosis into endosomes and, for some receptors such as the β2AR, colocalize with the transferrin receptor and the Ras-related rab5 GTPase (16Moore R.H. Tuffaha A. Millman E.E. Dai W. Hall H.S. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After endocytosis, a receptor can be recycled to the cell surface or targeted for degradation. The down-regulation of the total number of receptors after a prolonged treatment with an agonist is thought to mediate long term desensitization. Recent studies have revealed distinct mechanisms implicated in GPCRs degradation. Several receptors are, at least in part, degraded via an endocytosis-independent mechanism (V2R (17Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6476-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), β2AR (18Jockers R. Angers S. Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M.

Although pathways of degradation for some GPCRs are known, the trafficking of the majority of receptors toward degradation is not well described. Following internalization in clathrin-coated vesicles, GPCRs are targeted to the early endosome compartments where Rab4 and Rab5 are implicated in recycling or regulation of the early endocytic pathway, respectively (29Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Rab7 is known to regulate trafficking from early to late endosomes and might be linked to trafficking toward lysosomes (30Mukhopadhyay A. Funato K. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13055-13059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The β2AR can accumulate in perinuclear Rab-11 dependent compartments (16Moore R.H. Tuffaha A. Millman E.E. Dai W. Hall H.S. Dickey B.F. Knoll B.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) while Rab5- and Rab7-dependent trafficking is implicated in κ-opioid receptor trafficking toward degradation (20Li J.G. Benovic J.L. Liu-Chen L.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, monoubiquitination on cytoplasmic lysine residues of the β2AR (23Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and CXCR4 (31Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) promotes their targeting to lysosomes. In the present study, we investigated whether PAF-induced receptor endocytosis is a prerequisite for PAFR down-regulation. Using markers such as labeled transferrin, EEA1, rab5, and rab7 and specific inhibitors, we also examined the trafficking pathways involved in receptor down-regulation and evaluated the role of proteasomes and lysosomes in this phenomenon. The possible agonist-dependent or -independent mono-ubiquitination of PAFR was also assessed since ubiquitination is known to be linked to degradation by both lysosomes and proteasomes.

Then, 115 μCi of Redivue Pro-Mix [35S]methionine was added for 2 h, at 37 °C. Medium was removed, and cells were then incubated for 2 h in DMEM high glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum. Pretreatments and stimulation with methylcarbamyl-PAF (10-6m) were performed for the indicated times. Samples were lysed in 0.9 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% SDS, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 μg/ml AEBSF). The lysate was solubilized by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The precleared lysate was incubated with an anti-c-Myc antibody for 30 min, then 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. After extensive washing with RIPA buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from beads with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were exposed to Hyperfilm MP. Confocal Microscopy Analysis of EEA1—Confocal microscopy analysis was performed as previously described, with some modifications (10Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

The cells were then incubated with goat anti-EEA1 antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, followed by biotin-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies for 1 h, then with a mixture of rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies and streptavidin-FITC for 1 h. After washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides. The cells were analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA) Multi-Probe 2001 confocal argon laser scanning system equipped with a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence inverted microscope. Scanned images were transferred to a Silicon Graphics Indy 4000 workstation equipped with Molecular Dynamics Imagespace analysis software. Confocal Microscopy Analysis of Transferrin—The cells were grown on coverslips (22 mm), 40 h post-transfection, incubated with serumfree DMEM containing PAF 10-7m, anti-cMyc antibodies, 50 μg/ml transferrin-Alexa568 and 0.1% BSA at 4 °C for 1 h, then at 37 °C for indicated times, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature.

The binding assays were done on 5 × 104 cells in a total volume of 0.25 ml of the same buffer, containing 10 nm [3H]WEB2086, at room temperature for 90 min. Binding reactions were stopped by centrifugation. The cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Receptor Sequestration—The evaluation of receptor sequestration was done on COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type receptor and indicated coexpressed proteins, as described previously (32Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to medium or PAF in the presence of [3H]PAF at room temperature for 30 min in following buffer (150 mm choline chloride, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, in presence of 0.25% lipid-free BSA) (33Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then washed twice with the same buffer + 2% BSA and harvested in 0.1 m NaOH. [3H]PAF uptake was then measured by liquid scintillation. Statistics—Student's t test was performed to determine statistical significance. Down-regulation of PAFR Expression—Twenty-four hours post-transfection, COS-7 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h, washed, and then incubated in new medium for indicated times. PAFR was then immunoprecipitated, proteins were separated by electrophoresis, and bands were quantified by densitometric analysis after gels were exposed to film. An 18-h stimulation with a non-hydrolyzable PAF analog, methylcarbamyl-PAF (10-6m), was performed to evaluate the maximum level of receptor degradation. In Fig. 1A, a representative autoradiogram indicates a decreased concentration of receptors after stimulation. Fig. 1B shows the densitometric representation of several experiments (n = 4) and indicates that 42 ± 6.5% receptors disappear in reference to unstimulated cells. To further characterize the down-regulation of PAFR, a time-dependent degradation curve was plotted (Fig. 1C). Basal constitutive degradation could be observed and corresponds to ∼50% of ligand-induced degradation. Approximately 25% more receptors were degraded after 5 h of ligand exposure, and the degradation reached a plateau by 8 h of stimulation. Dynamin-dependent Down-regulation of PAFR—Previous studies showed that PAFR internalization occurs through clathrin-coated pits and is dependent on dynamin (32Le Gouill C. Parent J.L.

Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7356-7362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether internalization was necessary for down-regulation, we analyzed the role of dynamin in the methylcarbamyl-PAF-induced degradation of the receptor. Interestingly, the expression of wild-type dynamin (Dyn1A) increased receptor expression, compared with cells not expressing the construct. An 8-h stimulation with methylcarbamyl-PAF induced receptor down-regulation comparable to control cells (∼40%). However, PAF-stimulated receptor down-regulation was completely inhibited by the dominant-negative dynamin (Dyn1A[K44A]), without a significant change in basal degradation (Fig. 2A). Binding studies indicated that the numbers of receptors on the cell surface did not change significantly in cells expressing wild-type or dominant-negative dynamin (Fig. 2B), but PAF internalization was blocked in cells expressing Dyn1A[K44A] (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that PAF-stimulated PAFR degradation is dependent on internalization. Transferrin Receptor and Early Endosomal Localization of Internalized PAFR—In Fig. 3, we assessed whether PAFR followed the well-established internalization pathway of the transferrin receptor (TfnR). To visualize internalization of PAFR and TfnR simultaneously, cells were prelabeled with transferrin (Tfn) conjugated to Alexa-568, rinsed, and incubated with PAF. Fig. 3, A and B show the basal expression of both TfnR and PAFR, respectively, with no colocalization of transferrin and PAFR (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3, D and E show the transferrin and PAF receptor distribution following stimulation; Fig. 3F illustrates their colocalization. Although transferrin receptor trafficking is known to proceed through early sorting endosomes following internalization, it is also transiting through recycling endosomes (36Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Therefore, localization of the TfnR does not distinguish among segregated endosomal compartments. The Early Endosome Antigen I (EEAI) localizes selectively to early endosomes (38Rubino M. Miaczynska M. Lippe R. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3745-3748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To determine whether PAFR traffics to early endosomes following endocytosis, we assessed its possible colocalization with EEAI. In Fig. 4, A and B, the basal distribution of EEAI and PAFR, respectively, is illustrated. Fig. 4C shows no colocalization without PAF stimulation. Following PAF stimulation, EEAI expression is unchanged (Fig. 4D) while PAFR distribution shows internalization (Fig. 4E). The merging of the images demonstrates colocalization of EEAI and PAFR after 30 min of PAF stimulation (Fig. 4F).Fig. 4Early endosome autoantigen I colocalization with internalized PAFR. 40 h after transfection with PAFR cDNA, COS-7 cells were incubated with or without PAF (10-6m) and anti-c-Myc antibodies, then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde before labeling with anti-EEA1 antibodies. Cells were then incubated with biotin-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies, followed by a mixture of rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies and streptavidin-FITC.

We examined the effects of the proteasome inhibitor PSI and lysosomal enzyme inhibitor EST on methylcarbamyl-PAF induced PAFR degradation. When cells were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor PSI, the level of degradation was diminished by half (p < 0.04), and similar results were obtained with clastolactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). Pretreatment of PAFR expressing COS-7 cells with EST significantly (p < 0.04) decreased receptor degradation, compared with cells without inhibitor (Fig. 5). Chloroquine, another lysosome degradation inhibitor had a similar effect (data not shown). When used together, EST and PSI completely blocked PAF-induced receptor degradation. The inhibitors had no significant effect on receptor expression in unstimulated cells. Rab5 Involvement in PAFR Trafficking—Trafficking of clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane to early sorting endosomes, one of the first steps in the endocytic pathway, is mediated by Rab5 (29Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). We examined the involvement of Rab5 in the targeting of PAFR for degradation (Fig. 6). The coexpression of PAFR and Rab5[WT] induced a massive loss of total receptors, however, PAF still stimulated a further loss of 44 ± 3% of after 8 h. When the PAFR was coexpressed with a dominant negative form of Rab5, Rab5[S34N] (39Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M.

The expression of cell surface receptors (Fig. 6C) and PAFR internalization (Fig. 6D); however, was not changed with Rab5 coexpression indicating that Rab5 did not promote internalization but rather promoted the degradation of intracellular receptors. Rab7 Involvement in PAFR Trafficking—Rab7 is important in membrane transport from early sorting endosome to late endosomes (42Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 43Vitelli R. Santillo M. Lattero D. Chiariello M. Bifulco M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the involvement of Rab7 in PAFR trafficking toward its degradation by coexpression with the wild-type Rab7 or the dominant-negative mutant Rab7[N125I] (Fig. 6B). The total concentration of receptors was decreased with wild-type Rab7 cotransfection but PAF stimulated a further down-regulation of PAFR. The co-expression of the dominant-"

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), increased in the heart following MI, increases matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. Here, we show that OPN alone has no effect on MMP activity or expression. However, it reduces IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP activity and expression in adult rat cardiac fibroblasts. Pretreatment with bovine serum albumin had no effect on MMP activity or protein content, whereas GRGDS (glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine)-pentapeptide (which interrupts binding of RGD-containing proteins to cell surface integrins) and monoclonal antibody m7E3 (a rat β3 integrins antagonist) inhibited the effects of OPN. Inhibition of PKC using chelerythrine inhibited the activities of both MMP-2 and MMP-9. Stimulation of cells using IL-1β increased phosphorylation and translocation of PKC to membrane fractions, which was inhibited by OPN. OPN inhibited IL-1β-stimulated increases in translocation of PKC-ζ from cytosolic to membrane fractions. Furthermore, the levels of phospho-PKC-ζ were lower in the cytosolic fractions of OPN knock-out mice hearts as compared with wild type 6 days post-MI. Inhibition of PKC-ζ using PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate inhibited IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. These observations suggest that OPN, acting via β3 integrins, inhibits IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity, at least in part, via the involvement of PKC-ζ. Thus, OPN may play a key role in collagen deposition during myocardial remodeling following MI by modulating cytokine-stimulated MMP activity.

Because of their ability to initiate and continue the degradation of fibrillar collagens, the gelatinases are considered to play a major role in the remodeling of collagenous ECM (19.Creemers E.E. Cleutjens J.P. Smits J.F. Daemen M.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Since MMPs are capable of degrading ECM, the activity of these enzymes is under strict regulation. Within the heart, MMPs are synthesized by fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, and cardiac myocytes (19.Creemers E.E. Cleutjens J.P. Smits J.F. Daemen M.J. Circ.

Recently, using in vitro cultures of cardiac fibroblasts, Siwik et al. (26.Siwik D.A. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α increase MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activities. However, signaling pathways involved in the regulation of MMP expression and activity have not yet been clarified. In cells of non-cardiac origin, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is suggested to play a critical role in the regulation of expression and activity of MMPs (27.Mackay A.R. Ballin M. Pelina M.D. Farina A.R. Nason A.M. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Invasion Metastasis. 1992; 12: 168-184PubMed Google Scholar). Among the PKC isoforms, the activation of PKC-ζ (atypical isoform) is shown to be essential for MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 secretion in rabbit smooth muscle cells (28.Hussain S. Assender J.W. Bond M.

The data presented here suggest that OPN inhibits IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity via the involvement of PKC-ζ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRat Cardiac Fibroblasts Culture and Treatments—Adult rat cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from the supernatant of adult rat cardiac myocytes as described previously (26.Siwik D.A. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to confluence and serum-starved for 48 h before use. Cells from the first and second passages were used for all of the experiments. The cells were treated with IL-1β (4 ng/ml) for 48 h to measure MMP activity or for 15–30 min to measure activation and translocation of PKC and PKC-ζ. OPN (50–200 nm, purchased from R&D systems), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 100 nm), GRGDS-pentapeptide (100 nm), or monoclonal antibody m7E3 F(ab′)2 (m7E3, 40–160 μg/ml) was added 30 min prior to the addition of IL-1β. The β3 integrin antagonist m7E3, kindly received from Dr. Robert Jordan (Centocor), binds rat β3 integrins and has been shown to inhibit MMP activity and smooth muscle cell migration (29.Bendeck M.P. Nakada M.T. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For experiments testing the role of PKC, cells were pretreated with chelerythrine (1–5 μm) or PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate (50 μm) for 30 min followed by treatment with IL-1β for 48 h.In-gel Zymography—MMP activity in the conditioned media of fibroblasts was measured as described previously (26.Siwik D.A. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The media were collected, centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to remove cells and debris, and lyophilized to dryness. The pellet was resuspended in water, and protein content was determined using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples (500 ng of protein) were loaded under non-reducing conditions onto 4% stacking and 10% separating SDS-polyacrylamide gel polymerized with 1 mg/1 ml gelatin (type A from porcine skin, Sigma) as a substrate and electrophoresed at 15–20 mA. Following electrophoresis, the gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min with gentle shaking followed by a 30-min wash in distilled water. The gels were then incubated overnight at 37 °C in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3), stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and then destained using 7% acetic acid and 40% methanol solution. Clear and digested regions representing MMP activity were quantified using an imaging densitometry (GS 700, Bio-Rad), and molecular weights were estimated using prestained molecular weight markers.Western Blot Analyses—Activation of PKC and PKC-ζ was studied using Western analyses. Total cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and protein contents were measured using the Bradford assay. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (30.Miranti C.K. Ohno S. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10571-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 20 min. The cells were lysed using Dounce homogenization. The lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min. The collected supernatant was considered a cytosolic fraction. The pellet containing membranes was resuspended in the hypotonic buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged again at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected as membrane fraction. Equal amounts of proteins (30 μg) from total cell lysate, cytosolic fractions, or membrane fractions were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then probed with anti-phospho-PKC (pan) or anti-phospho-PKC-ζ (Thr-410, Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies. Anti-phospho-PKC(pan)antibodies used in Western blot recognize α, βI, βII, ξ, ϵ, η, and δ isoforms. The membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies and analyzed as described previously (5.Singh K. Balligand J.L. Fischer T.A. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol.

Protein expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was measured in the conditioned media using monoclonal MMP-2 or MMP-9 antibodies.RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA from cells was extracted using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). RNA was size-fractionated on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Genescreen plus membrane. The blots were hybridized overnight using MMP-2 cDNA as probe as described previously (8.Singh K. Sirokman G. Communal C. Robinson K.G. Conrad C.H. Brooks W.W. Bing O.H. Colucci W.S.

The sham animals underwent the same procedure without ligation of the coronary artery. All of the experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were sacrificed 6 days post-MI. To prepare cytosolic fractions, tissue from non-infarcted left ventricle region was homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij-35, and 0.02% NaN3) using glass homogenizer as described previously (33.Podesser B.K.

The samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 2,500 rpm. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was collected as cytosolic fraction and analyzed by Western blot using anti-phospho-PKC-ζ antibodies. The membrane was then deprobed and reprobed with anti-PKC-ζ (total) antibodies. To prepare total heart lysate, tissue from non-infarcted left ventricle region was homogenized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Equal amounts of proteins from the supernatant were analyzed by Western blot using anti-phospho PKC-ζ and anti-PKC-ζ antibodies.Statistical Analyses—All of the data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc Tukey's test. Probability (p) values of <0.05 were considered to be significant.RESULTSOPN Inhibits IL-1β-stimulated Increases in MMP Activity— In-gel zymography of conditioned media from cardiac fibroblasts showed that IL-1β significantly increases MMP activity, confirming our previous finding (26.Siwik D.A. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with OPN in the presence of IL-1β dose dependently inhibited IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP activity (Fig. 1A). The inhibition in MMP activity was detectable at 50 nm concentration of OPN; however, it was significant at 100 nm. Therefore, a 100 nm concentration was used for further experiments. Treatment of cells with OPN inhibited IL-1β-stimulated (folds change versus control) MMP-2 (bands corresponding to 72/66 kDa; IL-1β, 1.8 ± 0.1; IL-1β+OPN, 1.48 ± 0.1; p < 0.001, n = 12) and MMP-9 (bands corresponding to 95/88 kDa; IL-1β, 3.7 ± 0.4; IL-1β+OPN, 1.4 ± 0.4; p < 0.001, n = 12) activities. OPN alone had no effect on MMP activity. To confirm that the above observations are specific for OPN, cardiac fibroblasts were pretreated with BSA (100 nm) followed by treatment with IL-1β for 48 h. An analysis of conditioned media showed that pretreatment of cells with BSA did not significantly affect MMP-2 (IL-1β, 1.8 ± 0.1; IL-1β+BSA, 1.9 ± 0.2) and MMP-9 (IL-1β, 3.7 ± 0.4; IL-1β+BSA, 3.5 ± 0.2; see Fig. 1) activities.Western blot analyses of the conditioned media demonstrated that IL-1β increases MMP-2 (Fig. 2A) and MMP-9 (Fig. 2B) protein contents by 7.9 ± 0.01- and 10.2 ± 1.7-folds, respectively. Pretreatment with OPN reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels 0.8 ± 0.1- and 1.0 ± 0.1-folds (p < 0.05 versus IL-1β), respectively. Pretreatment with BSA had no significant effect on IL-1β-mediated increases in MMP2 and MMP-9 protein contents.Fig. 2OPN inhibits IL-1β-stimulated MMP protein and mRNA expression. Confluent cultures of cardiac fibroblasts were pretreated with OPN (100 nm) or BSA (100 nm) for 30 min followed by treatment with IL-1β (4 ng/ml) for 48 h. MMP-2 (A) and MMP-9 (B) protein levels in the conditioned media were analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-MMP-2 and anti-MMP-9 antibodies. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. C, total cellular RNAs were analyzed by Northern analysis using MMP-2 cDNA probe.

Therefore, to study the receptor-mediated effects of OPN, cells were pretreated with GRGDS-pentapeptide (100 nm). An analysis of conditioned media showed that pretreatment with GRGDS-pentapeptide significantly inhibits OPN-mediated decreases in MMP-2 (IL-1β, 2.0 ± 0.1; IL-1β+OPN, 1.3 ± 0.1; RGD+IL-1β+OPN, 1.7 ± 0.1-folds) and MMP-9 (IL-1β, 3.5 ± 0.3; IL-1β+OPN, 1.7 ± 0.1; RGD+IL-1β+OPN, 3.2 ± 0.3-folds) activities (Fig. 3). Similarly, OPN-mediated reduction in MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels in the conditioned media was inhibited by pretreatment with GRGDS-pentapeptide (data not shown), suggesting involvement of receptor-mediated signaling in OPN-stimulated regulation of MMP activity.Fig. 3GRGDS-pentapeptide inhibits the effects of OPN on IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP activity. Confluent cultures of cardiac fibroblasts were pretreated with GRGDS-pentapeptide (RGD, 100 nm) for 30 min followed by treatment with OPN protein (100 nm) for 30 min.

To demonstrate that the effects of m7E3 are specific, cells were pretreated with BSA (160 μg/ml) in the presence of OPN (Fig. 4, lane 4).Fig. 4β3 integrin antagonist m7E3 inhibits the effects of OPN on IL-1β-stimulated increases in MMP activity.

https://openalex.org/W1993738349,"Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) is a secreted glycoprotein originally described as a hormone involved in calcium and phosphate homeostasis in bony fishes. We recently identified the mammalian homolog of this molecule to be highly up-regulated in an in vitro model of angiogenesis, as well as focally and intensely expressed at sites of pathological angiogenesis (e.g. tumor vasculature). In the present study, we report that STC1 is a selective modulator of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced endothelial migration and morphogenesis, but not proliferation. STC1 did not inhibit proliferative or migratory responses to vascular endothelial growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor. The mechanism of STC1 inhibitory effects on HGF-induced endothelial migration seem to occur secondary to receptor activation because STC1 did not inhibit HGF-induced c-met receptor phosphorylation, but did block HGF-induced focal adhesion kinase activation. In the mouse femoral artery ligation model of angiogenesis, STC1 expression closely paralleled that of the endothelial marker CD31, and the peak level of STC1 expression occurred after an increase in HGF expression. We propose that STC1 may play a selective modulatory role in angiogenesis, possibly serving as a “stop signal” or stabilizing factor contributing to the maturation of newly formed blood vessels. HGF is a mesenchyme-derived pleiotropic factor with mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic activities on a number of different cell types. HGF effects are mediated through a specific tyrosine kinase, c-met, and aberrant HGF and c-met expression are frequently observed in a variety of tumors. Recent studies have shown HGF to be a potent growth factor implicated in wound healing, tissue regeneration, and angiogenesis.

In a related study, we analyzed the gene expression profile of endothelial cells undergoing HGF- and VEGF-stimulated morphogenesis using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.

The objective of the present study was to determine what role STC1 played in HGF-induced responses of vascular endothelial cells. Reagents—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and maintained in endothelial growth medium (Clonetics) supplemented with fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 10%. Other reagents included type 1 rat tail collagen (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), recombinant bFGF (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), and recombinant VEGF and HGF (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). All other cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Isolation of STC1 and Construction of Expression Vectors—cDNA clones were isolated from a human endothelial cDNA library and sequenced in their entirety. Fc fusion proteins (immunoadhesins) were prepared by fusion of the entire open reading frame of STC-1 in frame with the Fc region of human IgG1 using the baculovirus vector pHIF, a derivative of pVL1393 purchased from PharMingen. Fusion proteins were transiently expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified over a protein A column. STC1 was also expressed as a C-terminal His tag fusion in Escherichia coli and the denatured protein was used for immunization. The identities of the purified proteins were verified by N-terminal sequence analysis. Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies to STC1—Ten Balb/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, DE) were hyperimmunized with recombinant polyhistidine-tagged (HIS8) human STC1 expressed in E. coli (Genentech) in Ribi adjuvant (Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., Hamilton, MO). B-cells from five mice demonstrating high anti-STC1 antibody titers were fused with mouse myeloma cells (X63.Ag8.653; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) using a modified protocol analogous to one described previously (3Hongo J.

Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12802) Google Scholar). After 10–14 days, the supernatants were harvested and screened for antibody production by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Five positive clones, showing the highest immunobinding after the second round of subcloning by limiting dilution, were injected into Pristane primed mice (5Freund Y. Blair P. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2826-2830PubMed Google Scholar) for in vivo production of the monoclonal antibody. The ascites fluids were pooled and purified by protein A affinity chromatography (fast protein liquid chromatography, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (3Hongo J. Mora-Worms M. Lucas C. Fendly B. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The purified antibody preparations were sterile filtered (0.2-μm pore size; Nalgene, Rochester, NY) and stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. For ELISA for STC1, high binding, flat-bottom polypropylene 96-well plates (NUNC, Naperville, IL) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl monoclonal STC1 antibody 2734 (250 ng/ml). The plates were washed (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween), blocked (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0. 5% BSA), and washed again before adding 100 μlof supernatant or STC1 onto duplicate wells. After subsequent washing steps, a second biotinylated STC1 monoclonal antibody (2733; 250 ng/ml) was added to the wells. After a 2-h incubation and a wash step, a 1:10,000 dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the plates. Tetramethyl benzidine (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) and 1 m phosphoric acid were added, and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined (Spectra Max 250, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The minimum level of STC1 that could be reliably detected by the ELISA was 20 pg/ml. For RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (ABI PRISM TaqMan), Tri-reagent-LS (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) was added to the cells, and total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer's protocols. Gene-specific oligonucleotide primer pairs and a specific probe (labeled with a fluorescent dye at the 5′ end and a quencher fluorescent dye at the 3′ end) were designed using Oligo version 4.0 software (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN) and levels of STC1 mRNA were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (ABI PRISM TaqMan), as described previously (6Kahn J.

Culture of Cells—HUVECs were routinely grown on gelatin-coated (1 μg/ml) plates in endothelial growth media. Drugs and growth factors were added to the media and pre-warmed to 37 °C before addition to the HUVECs. Collagen gels containing HUVECs were prepared as described previously (1Xin X. Yang S. Ingle G.

For “film” experiments, endothelial cells were seeded onto the surface of a collagen gel and incubated in the identical media as that described for the gel experiments. To evaluate endothelial morphogenesis on Matrigel™, cells were incubated in 1× basal media in the presence of various factors, as described. Network formation was quantitated at 8 h by photographing three random fields of each well and then determining the total network area/field using OpenLab software (Improvision). Cell Migration Assay—HTS multi-well insert 24-well plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with cell attachment factor (BD Biosciences) on the bottom layer and type 1 collagen on the membrane surface. 25,000 cells were seeded into each chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The collagen and unmigrated cells were scraped off the membrane surface with a plastic pasteur pipette, and then all media were aspirated. Absolute methanol was added to the membranes, and the membranes were fixed at room temperature for 30 min. The methanol was aspirated off, and a 10 μm solution of YO-PRO-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added. Cells were counted under fluorescein isothiocyanate optics using OpenLab version 2.5 (Improvision). Proliferation Assay—5,000 cells were seeded onto gelatin-coated 96-well plates and incubated overnight with endothelial growth medium. The cells were then starved for 3 days with M199 containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. 20 ng/ml of various growth factors were added to the starvation media, and the cells were incubated for 4 days. Alamar blue solution (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) was added to the wells in an amount equal to 10% of the culture volume and incubated for 4–6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The plates were read on a Spectra Max Gemini (Molecular Devices), with the OD excitation at 535 nm and emission at 590 nm. Femoral Ligation Surgery—Femoral artery ligation was performed under isoflurane (Aerrane, Fort Dodge, CO) inhalation anesthesia on 8- to 10-week-old male C57/Bl6J mice (Charles River Laboratories). Briefly, the femoral artery was isolated at the level of the inguinal ligament and ligated with 7–0 silk suture (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). Animals were allowed to recover on a warm water heating pad until ambulatory. Total RNA was isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle of both the ligated and sham animals. Six animals were used for the control (sham) and six animals for the ligated group for each time point. Effects of STC1 on HGF-induced c-met and FAK Phosphorylation— Confluent HUVEC were incubated overnight in basal medium. Cells were pretreated with native or boiled STC1 (5 μg/ml) for 30 min. HGF was then added, and cells were incubated for a 15-min incubation at 37 °C. After the addition of lysate buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton, protease inhibitor mix (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor mix (Sigma)), lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to c-met (C-28, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate Biotech). In other experiments, lysates were prepared after pretreatment of cells with STC1, followed by HGF, VEGF, or bFGF, and lysates were prepared as above. Samples were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to FAK (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine as above. For the data analysis, numerical data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., and the n for each experiment is provided in the figure legends or text. To determine statistical significance, data were first evaluated by ANOVA, followed by a Student's t test for non-paired values. In experiments where multiple comparisons were made against controls, Bonferroni's modified t test was used. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Regulation of STC1 Production in Endothelial Cells in Monolayer Culture—To evaluate the effects of various cytokines and growth factors on the release of STC1 from HUVEC, we developed an ELISA-based assay (see “Materials and Methods” for details) which was capable of measuring STC1 levels as low as 20 pg/ml. There was no detectable STC1 release from unstimulated HUVEC (not shown). To survey for the possible effects of various cytokines and growth factors on STC1 release, confluent endothelial cells cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates were incubated with these factors for 24, 48, and 72 h, and STC1 levels were determined in the cell supernatants. The majority of factors evaluated had either no effect (e.g. VEGF, TGF, bradykinin, histamine, and TNF) or very modest effects (IL-1) on STC1 release at these time points. The concentrations shown in Table I are the highest concentration tested (for each drug we tested, the indicated dose and at least two lower doses (e.g. 1:10 and 1:100) of that shown). Of the growth factors examined, only bFGF and HGF stimulated significant STC1 release. The cytokines IL-6 and IL-4 also stimulated STC1 release.Table IEffects of various agonists on the release of STC-1 by HUVECStimuliSTC124 hr48 hr72 hrng/mlMedia<0.02<0.02<0.02Calcium ionophore (10 mg/ml)<0.02<0.02NDaND, not determined.Bradykinin (1 μm)<0.02<0.02NDHistamine (1 μm)<0.02<0.02NDVEGF (400 ng/ml)<0.02<0.02<0.02TGF β (50 ng/ml)<0.02<0.02<0.02IFNγ (25 ng/ml)<0.02<0.02<0.02bFGF (400 ng/ml)<0.02<0.02.092HGF (400 ng/ml)<0.02<0.02.112TNFα (10 ng/ml)<0.02<0.02.06IL-6 (25 ng/ml)<0.02.023.114IL-1 (10 ng/ml)<0.02.027.027IL-4 (25 ng/ml)<0.02.025.122PMA (100 ng/ml).023.057.183a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Levels of STC1 mRNA and Protein Secretion Are Much Greater in Three-dimensional Cultures Compared with Two-dimensional Cultures—Equal numbers (1.5 × 107) of HUVEC were plated either onto type I collagen gels (film experiments) or suspended in type I collagen gels (gel experiments) and incubated with HGF and VEGF (200 ng/ml) for various times as indicated in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the combination of HGF and VEGF was required in three-dimensional gels for survival; as described previously, neither growth factor alone was capable of supporting survival and tubulogenesis in three-dimensional collagen gels (1Xin X. Yang S. Ingle G. Zlot C. Rangell L. Kowalski J. Schwall R. Ferrara N. Gerritsen M.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1111-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels (Fig. 1A) for STC1 rose dramatically in the gel versus film environment, such that at 24 h, the mRNA levels for STC1 were 10- to 20-fold higher in the three-dimensional cultures. Levels of STC1 protein (Fig. 1B) in the supernatants were 2- to 6-fold higher in the three-dimensional cultures. Because the cells are embedded in three-dimensional collagen gels, any protein in the supernatants must be “released” from the gel to be detected, and this may account for the discrepancy in relative ratios of mRNA versus protein in the two environments. Effects of STC1 on Endothelial Proliferation—STC1 (0.001–5 μg/ml) had no effect on bFGF-stimulated (10 ng/ml), VEGF-stimulated (10 ng/ml), or HGF-stimulated (10 ng/ml) endothelial proliferation (data not shown). Additionally, STC1 did not stimulate endothelial proliferation when tested in the absence of growth factors (not shown). Effects of STC1 on HGF-induced Endothelial Migration— HGF is a known potent stimulus for endothelial migration. Therefore, we determined the role of STC1 in HGF-induced endothelial cell migration. As shown in Fig. 2A, when rSTC1 (Ig fusion protein) was added to the Boyden chambers, it markedly inhibited the migratory response of the endothelial cells to HGF. Denaturation of the recombinant protein by boiling completely eliminated this inhibitory activity. Additionally, the inhibitory effects of STC1 were not observed at lower (2.5 ng/ml) concentrations of the protein. The inhibitory effects of STC1 on HGF cell migration were also blocked by the inclusion of 25 μg/ml of the anti-STC1 monoclonal, 2734 (Fig. 2B), in contrast to the lack of effect of an isotype-matched non-immune IgG. To further evaluate the selective effects of STC1 on endothelial cell migration, we evaluated the effects of rSTC1 on bFGF-induced (10 ng/ml) and VEGF-induced (10 ng/ml) endothelial cell migration. These doses of bFGF and VEGF elicited a similar magnitude of cell migration as 20 ng/ml HGF, yet none of the STC1 reagents tested (native STC1, boiled STC1, STC1 monoclonal antibody 2734 (25 μg/ml)) had a significant effect on the migratory response to bFGF or VEGF (data not shown). Effects of STC1 on HGF-induced Endothelial Morphogenesis—To evaluate the possible effects of STC1 on endothelial morphogenesis, we tested the effects of native rSTC1 and boiled STC1 on HGF-induced endothelial branching network formation on growth factor-depleted Matrigel™. In this model, incubation of endothelial cells without a growth factor such as HGF results in little or no cord formation (not shown). Addition of HGF (20 ng/ml) results in an elaborate network of endothelial branching structures (Fig. 3A). Addition of rSTC1 (1 μg/ml) markedly reduced the overall area of endothelial networks (Fig. 3B), and the structures that did form were discontinuous and poorly formed. Heat denaturation abrogated the effects of rSTC1 (Fig. 3A). Effects of STC1 on HGF-induced c-met and FAK Phosphorylation—HGF induced the phosphorylation of c-met (Fig. 4). Pretreatment or cotreatment of HUVEC with 5 μg/ml STC1 did not reduce the phosphorylation response of c-met to added HGF (Fig. 4), suggesting that STC1 did not inhibit HGF binding to its receptor. To determine possible effects downstream of c-met phosphorylation, we examined the effects of STC1 HGF-induced FAK activation. STC1 abrogated HGF-induced phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 5). Preliminary experiments indicated that maximal FAK phosphorylation after HGF treatment occurred at 60 min. Pretreatment of the endothelial cells with 5 μg/ml STC1 completely blocked HGF-induced FAK phosphorylation. Although difficult to detect, the modest FAK phosphorylation induced by bFGF or VEGF (Fig. 5) was not inhibited by pretreatment with STC1.Fig. 5STC1 inhibits FAK phosphorylation induced by HGF. HUVECs were pretreated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml STC1 and then challenged with HGF (10 ng/ml), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or bFGF (10 ng/ml) for 60 min. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for FAK, separated by gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The resulting blots were immunoblotted with antibodies to phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of STC1 in the Hind-limb Ischemia Model of Angiogenesis—We also evaluated the expression of STC1 in the mouse femoral ligation assay. In this model, the femoral artery is ligated, dramatically reducing blood flow to the lower limb including the gastrocnemius muscle (7Couffinhal T. Silver M. Zheng L.P. Kearney M. Witzenbichler B. Isner J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1667-1679PubMed Google Scholar). This hypoxic insult results in the rapid development of new vessels in the hypoxic muscle as a component of the spontaneous recovery of perfusion, which is also associated with proximal arteriogenesis (8Ito W.D. Arras M. Scholz D. Winkler B. Htun P. Schaper W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273 (3 Pt 2, –H1265): H1255PubMed Google Scholar, 9Scholz D. Ito W. Fleming I. Deindl E. Sauer A. Wiesnet M. Busse R. Schaper J. Schaper W. Virchows Arch. 2000; 436: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Because the newly developing vessels are not readily visualized in this assay, we also measured the mRNA levels of the endothelial marker, CD31, as an index of new vessel formation. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, both CD31 mRNA and STC1 mRNA expression peaked at day 3 and then returned to lower levels at later time points. We also measured the mRNA levels of HGF. Interestingly, the expression of HGF also increased markedly in this in vivo model, peaking at day 3 (Fig. 6B) Stanniocalcin 1, a secreted protein, was first identified in fish, where it has been shown to regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis (10Wagner G. Hampong M. Park C. Copp D. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1986; 63: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Wagner G.F. Dimattia G.E. Davie J.R. Copp D.H. Friesen H.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A unique feature of STC1 is its lack of homology to any other proteins, except for stanniocalcin 2, to which it is 34% identical at the amino acid level. The human homolog of STC1 is 73% homologous to the salmon protein. However, in contrast to the fish, where STC1 is exclusively localized to the organ of Stannius, the mammalian homolog exhibits a much broader expression profile. The function of the mammalian STC1 is poorly understood, although roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis (12Wagner G.F. Vozzolo B.L. Jaworski E. Haddad M. Kline R.L. Olsen H.S. Rosen C.A.

DiMattia G. Wagner G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3925-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have been suggested. We first identified STC1 as one of the genes that demonstrated marked up-regulation in endothelial cells undergoing tubulogenesis (6Kahn J. Mehraban F. Ingle G. Xin X. Bryant J. Vehar G. Schoenfeld J. Grimaldi C. Peale F. Drakharapu A. Lewin D. Gerritsen M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1887-1900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role in angiogenesis. In situ studies demonstrated that the expression of STC1 was highly focal; high levels of expression were observed in small to large vessels at the periphery of lung and colon carcinomas and inflamed appendix (2Gerritsen M.E. Peale Jr., F.V. Wu T. Exp. Nephrol. 2002; 10: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Kahn J. Mehraban F. Ingle G. Xin X. Bryant J. Vehar G. Schoenfeld J. Grimaldi C. Peale F.

This hypothesis gained further support upon examination of the phenotype of STC1 transgenic mice (using a muscle-specific promoter). The STC1 mice were smaller than their wild-type littermates, yet baseline organ vascularity as well as induction of increased vascular density after femoral ligation were enhanced (14Filvaroff E.H. Guillet S. Zlot C. Bao M. Ingle G. Steinmetz H. Hoeffel J. Bunting S. Ross J. Carano R.A. Powell-Braxton L. Wagner G.F. Eckert R. Gerritsen M.E. French D.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3681-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that STC1 is an autocrine modulator of HGF-induced endothelial migration and morphogenesis (cord formation) on Matrigel™. These effects were selective to HGF because the responses of endothelial cells to either VEGF or bFGF were not modulated in these in vitro assays. Of the growth factors and cytokines examined, HGF was the most potent inducer of STC1 secretion. Finally, in an in vivo model of physiological angiogenesis, the mouse femoral ligation model, the expression profile of STC1 mRNA was similar to that of the endothelial marker, CD31, and moreover, the peak expression of STC1 mRNA was preceded by peak expression of HGF. The mechanism of the selective inhibition of HGF action on endothelial cells seems to be downstream of HGF binding to and activation of its receptor, c-met. Focal adhesion kinase, a 125-kDa cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is localized in focal adhesions, has been shown to play an important role in integrin-mediated cellular functions, including cell spreading and migration (16Taylor J.M.

A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), thus linking activation of this kinase to other signaling cascades. STC1 reduced HGF-induced FAK phosphorylation, consistent with hypothesis that STC1 interferes with one or more downstream signaling pathways activated by the c-met receptor. Moreover, the effects of STC1 seem to be selective for HGF because Bfgf- And VEGF-induced FAK phosphorylation were not inhibited. Our data are consistent with a modulatory role of STC1 in angiogenesis, possibly serving as a stop signal or stabilization factor contributing to the maturation of newly formed blood vessels. HGF is a potent although not endothelial-selective endothelial mitogen, morphogen, and motogen (25Morishita R. Aoki M. Yo Y. Ogihara I. Endocr.

STC1 receptors, at least in the liver and kidney, are present both on the plasma membrane and in the mitochondria (31McCudden C. James K. Hasilo C. Wagner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite being a secreted protein, STC1 is sequestered in the mitochondria (31McCudden C. James K. Hasilo C. Wagner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45249-45258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of cellular metabolism (14Filvaroff E.H.

https://openalex.org/W2172210205,"Abstract Peroxisomal β-oxidation system consists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-inducible pathway capable of catalyzing straight-chain acyl-CoAs and a second noninducible pathway catalyzing the oxidation of 2-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoAs. Disruption of the inducible β-oxidation pathway in mice at the level of fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), the first and rate-limiting enzyme, results in spontaneous peroxisome proliferation and sustained activation of PPARα, leading to the development of liver tumors, whereas disruptions at the level of the second enzyme of this classical pathway or of the noninducible system had no such discernible effects. We now show that mice with complete inactivation of peroxisomal β-oxidation at the level of the second enzyme, enoyl-CoA hydratase/l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (l-PBE) of the inducible pathway and d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase/d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (d-PBE) of the noninducible pathway (l-PBE-/-d-PBE-/-), exhibit severe growth retardation and postnatal mortality with none surviving beyond weaning. l-PBE-/-d-PBE-/- mice that survived exceptionally beyond the age of 3 weeks exhibited overexpression of PPARα-regulated genes in liver, despite the absence of morphological evidence of hepatic peroxisome proliferation. These studies establish that peroxisome proliferation in rodent liver is highly correlatable with the induction mostly of the l- and d-PBE genes. We conclude that disruption of peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation at the level of second enzyme in mice leads to the induction of many of the PPARα target genes independently of peroxisome proliferation in hepatocytes, raising the possibility that intermediate metabolites of very long-chain fatty acids and peroxisomal β-oxidation act as ligands for PPARα"

However, the presence of increased numbers of focal adhesion complexes in FAK-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) underlines a role for FAK in regulating focal adhesion turnover (9Ilic D.

A confounding issue is that all reported isolates of FAK–/– MEF express higher endogenous levels of the FAK-related kinase, Pyk2 (10Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D.

Some Src-mediated pathways remain active in FAK-deficient cells, such as ERK-2 activation following cell adhesion to fibronectin (10Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), whereas other pathways, such as motility and cytoskeletal reorganization, are defective (17Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of CAS by an activated FAK-Src complex (18Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y.

Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), possibly as a result of a direct linkage with Rac1 (20Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J.

Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, the relatively immotile phenotype of FAK–/– fibroblasts (9Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), even though these cells exhibit increased levels of CAS tyrosine phosphorylation (23Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S.I. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicates the dependence on FAK-mediated signals for full motility. Additionally, spatiotemporal constraints seem to be critical because Pyk2 is unable to rescue the immotility of FAK–/– cells as a result of its lack of a focal adhesion targeting protein domain found at the C terminus of FAK (25Klingbeil C.K. Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Jones K.C. Reider S.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1901; 152: 97-110Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Specific roles for Src family kinases have been difficult to dissect, in part because of the functional redundancy among family members as well as overlapping functions contributed by the FAK/Pyk2 family. One mechanism has been to correlate changes in cell behavior and signaling controls with tyrosine phosphorylation events induced during oncogenic transformation by the viral oncogene for v-Src. The list of potential Src substrates includes structural proteins involved with cytoskeletal architecture and sites of cell-cell and cell-ECM contact (e.g. vinculin, tensin, talin, cortactin, AFAP 110, β1 integrin, β-catenin, γ-catenin, p120CAS), as well as signaling proteins and nuclear transcription factors (e.g. FAK, p85 subunit of PI3K, phospholipase Cγ, p120RasGAP, p190RhoGAP, Shc, paxillin, p130CAS, and Stat3) (reviewed in Ref. 26Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to establish a causative role for these tyrosine phosphorylation events in specific parameters of v-Src-induced oncogenesis such as anchorage-, contact-, and mitogen-independence, metabolic changes, cytoskeletal reorganization, decreases in the number of adhesive sites, and increased motility (27Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Only recently, several reports demonstrated the requirement of Stat3 activation for v-Src-induced transformation of mouse fibroblasts (28Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell J.E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 29Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. De Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In contrast, transformation of chicken fibroblasts involves both the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and the PI3K-mTOR pathway (30Aftab D.T. Kwan J. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3028-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Penuel E. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although it is assumed that FAK plays a positive role in oncogenesis based on its increased expression and activity in many metastatic tumors (32Agochiya M. Brunton V.G. Owens D.W. Parkinson E.K.

Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear whether specific aspects of v-Src-induced oncogenic transformation require FAK. To address this issue, we used retroviruses to transduce a temperature-sensitive v-Src allele (ts72v-Src) into otherwise genetically matched FAK+/+ and FAK–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts. Our data indicate that FAK is dispensable for v-Src-induced growth factor and anchorage independence, morphological transformation, cell motility, and cytoskeleton reorganization. Data are presented showing an unexpected 7–10-fold enhancement in soft agar colony formation frequency induced by v-Src in the absence of FAK. This phenomenon was attenuated by FAK re-expression but was unaffected by either ts72v-Src or Pyk2 levels. FAK+/+ and FAK–/– MEF from p53–/– genetic backgrounds (gift of T. Yamamoto and S. Aizawa, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) and φNX ecotropic packaging cells (gift of G. Nolan) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pBluescript/ts72v-Src (37Gelman I. Khan S. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2995-3004PubMed Google Scholar) encoding a temperature sensitive v-Src gene from Rous sarcoma virus strain NY72 (38Mayer B.J. Jove R. Krane J.F. Poirier F. Calothy G. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 858-867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into the retroviral vector pBABE/puro (39Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Replication-defective virus was harvested 48 h following transfection of φNX ecotropic packaging cells (40Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar) with 20 μg of pBABE/puro or pBABE/puro/ts72v-Src DNA/106 cells and then filtered through 0.45-μm pore size low protein-binding filters (Pall/Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI). FAK+/+ and FAK–/– MEF were infected for 24 h in the presence of 5 μg ml–1 Polybrene (Sigma), and 48 h following infection the cultures were split 1:10 into media containing 2 μgml–1 puromycin for colony formation at 35 °C (PT). Clones were selected after growth under soft agar that were morphologically transformed at the PT but untransformed after 1–3 days of growth at 39.5 °C (NPT). For FAK re-expression, a BamHI fragment from pSRα-FAK (gift of K. Maruyama) containing the mouse FAK cDNA was inserted into the retroviral vector pBABE/hygro (39Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Viruses transducing the empty vector or FAK were produced as described above and used to infect FAK–/–[ts72v-Src] MEF at the PT. Clones of FAK re-expressing MEF were obtained after 2 weeks of hygromycin (300 μg ml–1) selection. Cells were kept at the NPT for 72 h prior to shift to the PT. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence and protein analysis, as described below, at the indicated time points after the temperature shift. Cells growing at the PT or NPT were washed with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl) with inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mg ml–1 each of aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C, protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and aliquots normalized for protein content were used for immunoprecipitation. 200–500 μg of total protein was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with the following antibodies: anti-FAK polyclonal antibody A-17 (1.25 μg ml–1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p130CAS mAb (1.5 μg ml–1; Transduction Laboratories/Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), anti-Pyk2 mAb (1.5 μg ml–1; Transduction Laboratories), and anti-paxillin mAb (1 μg ml–1; Transduction Laboratories). Immune complexes were immobilized on protein A/G PLUS agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed three times with RIPA buffer, and boiled in Laemmli buffer. Immunoprecipitates or equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to PolyScreen polyvinyl difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and immunoblotted, as described before (41Lin X. Gelman I.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2304-2312PubMed Google Scholar), with the following primary antibodies: anti-Tyr(P) 4G10 mAb (1:5000; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-FAK polyclonal antibody (gift of Jun-Lin Guan), anti-v-Src EC10 mAb (1:1000; Ref. 32Agochiya M. Brunton V.G. Owens D.W. Parkinson E.K. Paraskeva C. Keith W.N. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5646-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), anti-actin AC-40 mAb (1:1000; Sigma), anti-p130CAS mAb (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories), anti-paxillin mAb (1:5000; Transduction Laboratories), and anti-Pyk2 mAb (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit Ig (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) followed by ECL substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were stripped of antibody as described previously (42Lin X. Nelson P. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7259-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells (104) were seeded onto 35-mm dishes and allowed to grow under high (10% FBS) or low (0.5% FBS) serum conditions. Triplicate dishes were trypsinized and counted every 2 days using a hemacytometer (Fisher Scientific). Growth in soft agar was assayed in 60-mm dishes prepared with a lower layer of 0.7% agar (Difco Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ) overlaid with top agar (0.4%) containing 104 suspended cells. 15 days after plating, colonies were stained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (Sigma) and counted. For growth in methylcellulose, 2.5–5 × 106 cells were mixed into 50 ml of medium containing 1.3% methylcellulose (Sigma) and allowed to incubate in Petri dishes for 24–48 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with cold PBS, and lysed as described above. Cell stimulation with fibronectin was performed as described previously (43Gelman I.H. Lee K. Tombler E. Gordon R. Lin X. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1998; 41: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: cells were serum starved for 18 h in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and harvested by limited trypsin-EDTA treatment (0.05% trypsin and 2 mm EDTA in PBS). Trypsin was inactivated in DMEM containing 0.5 mg ml–1 soybean trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.5% BSA (Sigma), and cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5% FBS-containing DMEM and kept in suspension for 1 h at the PT (105 cells ml–1) prior to replating onto fibronectin- or poly-l-lysine-precoated 10-cm dishes (10 μg ml–1 fibronectin or 100 μg ml–1 poly-l-lysine in PBS, incubated overnight at 4 °C). 106 cells were seeded onto the precoated dishes and allowed to attach for 1 h at the PT. Attached cells and cells in suspension were lysed as described above. Cells grown on 22-mm2 coverslips were fixed in 60% acetone, 3.7% formaldehyde at –20 °C for 20 min or, for v-Src analysis, in 3.7% formaldehyde at 4 °C for 15 min followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature, as described previously (43Gelman I.H. Lee K. Tombler E. Gordon R. Lin X. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1998; 41: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-v-Src mAb EC10 (1:100), anti-Tyr(P) PY20 mAb (1:200; Transduction Laboratories), anti-paxillin mAb (1:250), anti-vinculin mAb (clone hVIN-1; 1:250; Sigma). Primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, respectively (1:250; Chemicon). Actin was visualized with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Images were obtained on an Olympus IX-70 fluorescence microscope fitted with a Sony Catseye digital camera and processed using Photoshop version 4.01 (Adobe). FAK+/+ and FAK–/– [ts72v-Src] cells grown at the PT for 2 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) containing dialyzed 10% FBS were pulsed for 2 h with 50 μCi ml–1 Tran35S-label (methionine/cysteine; ICN), followed by one wash with PBS and a chase with DMEM containing 10% FBS plus a 5 m excess of cold methionine and cysteine (Sigma). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and then equal protein aliquots were subjected to v-Src-specific immunoprecipitation as described above. The immunoprecipitations were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then phosphorimaged (Amersham Biosciences) or immunoblotted for v-Src as described above. Linear Motility—Cells plated sparsely (3 × 103 cells on gridded 22-mm CELLocate® coverslips; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) were photographed every 60 min for the first 12 h, and then once at 20 h, for linear, directional motility. At least three independent, fixed loci were monitored to establish the origin (O) points of individual cells (at least 10/field). Directional motility is defined as the linear distance moved (D) from origin (O) to the end point of the cell (E). Wound Healing—Clones of FAK–/– and FAK+/+ [ts72v-Src] cells were plated at confluence at the PT or NPT on gridded 22-mm coverslips. Monolayer wounds were produced using pipette tips, and then fixed loci were photographed at the times indicated. Haptotaxis—Assays for haptotaxis toward fibronectin were carried out in modified Boyden chambers containing 8-μm pore size, polyethylene tetraphthalate track-etched membranes (Falcon/Becton Dickinson). Membranes were coated overnight at 4 °C on the underside with human fibronectin (Becton Dickinson; 2.5, 5 and 7.5 μg/ml in PBS), rinsed with PBS, and placed into 24-well plates containing 500 μl of DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 0.5% BSA. Cells were serum-starved for 18 h in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS, trypsinized and resuspended in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and 0.5% BSA, and counted. 104 cells/300 μl were plated onto the upper side of the membrane, and migration was allowed to proceed for 4 h at the PT. At the end of the assay, cells on the upper surface were removed with a cotton swab and cells that migrated to the underside of the membrane were fixed and stained with Giemsa. Five independent fields of cells within each chamber were monitored under a 10× objective, and stained cells were scored. In control experiments, chambers without fibronectin coating were used for migration assays. Invasion—The ability of cells to migrate through Matrigel®-coated Boyden chambers has been described previously (41Lin X. Gelman I.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2304-2312PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from RIPA lysates of FAK+/+ and FAK–/– [ts72v-Src] cells grown at the PT were subjected to ts72v-Src immunoprecipitation as described above. Immune complexes were washed twice with Triton-only buffer (RIPA buffer without SDS and deoxycholic acid), twice with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol), and once with kinase buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2). Immune complexes were then resuspended in kinase buffer containing 5 μg of enolase (Sigma) and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN), and kinase reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 32 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer and boiling and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The lower part of the gel containing enolase was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, dried, and autoradiographed. The upper part of the gel containing immunoprecipitated ts72v-Src was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, followed by immunoblotting for v-Src and autoradiography (autophosphorylation). For RNAi, 29-mer oligonucleotides mapping to the C terminus of murine Pyk2 (ENSEMBL transcript ENSMUST00000022622) were chosen according to the rules described in the Hannon laboratory web site at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories (www.cshl.org/public/SCI-ENCE/hannon.html). Oligonucleotides (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) consisted of two palindromic 29-mer sequences flanking a 10-nt “bubble” encoding a HindIII site. Complementary oligonucleotides had 5′ BamHI and 3′ BseRI overhangs. For duplex formation, equimolar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were boiled in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 50 mm KCl and allowed to slowly reach room temperature. Duplexes were then phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and ligated into pSHAG (Refs. 44Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S.

Control oligonucleotides were similarly designed to target the pGL3 firefly luciferase transcript (pSHAG-FF; gift of G. Hannon). Recombinant plasmids were identified by HindIII digestion and further verified by sequencing. Cells were transfected with a 5:1:1 ratio of pCMV-Myc/Pyk2 (Myc tag at the N terminus, gift of W.-C.

FAK Is Dispensable for Morphological Transformation and Cytoskeletal Rearrangements Induced by v-Src—To evaluate the role of FAK in v-Src-induced transformation, FAK–/– and FAK+/+ MEF were transduced with ecotropic retrovirus encoding ts72v-Src, whose tyrosine kinase is active enzymatically at 35 °C (PT) yet inactive at 39.5 °C (NPT). Independent drugresistant clones were obtained that expressed similar levels of ts72v-Src (Fig. 1B), and multiple clones were examined to exclude clonal idiosyncrasies. This system allowed us to (a) control cellular transformation with temperature, (b) assess the role of FAK in specific p"

Two smaller subunits form a cyclin-dependent protein kinase (cdk)-cyclin pair that phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of pol II during the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (10Feaver W.J.

Beyond its role in transcription, six TFIIH subunits, including Ssl2 and Rad3, are components of a DNA “repairosome,” responsible for nucleotide excision repair of DNA damage (12Svejstrup J.Q.

Subcomplexes, apparently related to the distinct functional roles of TFIIH, have been reported (22Sung P. Guzder S.N. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In previous work from this laboratory, a 5-subunit “core” complex of the yeast proteins Rad3, Ssl1, Tfb1, Tfb2, and Tfb3 was described (18Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), with similar compositions to those from yeast, a notable discrepancy arose in regard to MAT1, the human counterpart of Tfb3 (25Adamczewski J.P. Rossignol M. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). MAT1 was isolated in association with the cdk-cyclin pair, rather than as part of the core complex (14Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Cavadore J.C.

Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 25Adamczewski J.P. Rossignol M. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The yeast homolog of p34, termed Tfb4, was late to be identified (24Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and although it was shown to be required for both transcription and nucleotide excision repair (27Feaver W.J. Huang W. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29564-29567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), it was not definitively assigned to a subcomplex. Recent studies (28Keogh M.C. Cho E.J. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have indicated an association of Tfb3 with the cdk-cyclin pair rather than with the yeast core complex. We now find that the component of the core complex originally identified as Tfb3 is, in fact, Tfb4. We confirm and extend the evidence for a Tfb3-cdk-cyclin trimer. The revised molecular description of yeast TFIIH is entirely coincident with that of the human factor. Construction of Baculoviruses Containing Genes for TFIIH Subunits and Expression in Insect Cells—Open reading frames (ORFs) of genes encoding, Rad3, Tfb1, Tfb2, Ssl1, Tfb3, and Tfb4, were amplified from yeast genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the BacPAK9 baculovirus expression vector (Clontech). A hexahistidine tag was added at the C terminus of the Tfb1 ORF. Recombinant viruses were produced in monolayer of Sf21 cells as described (Clontech). For protein expression, Sf21 cells (∼1.5 × 107) in a T75 flask were infected with various combinations of cloned virus stocks at a multiplicity of infection of 2–10. After 72 h, the cells were harvested and stored at –80 °C until use. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 600 mm potassium acetate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), and protease inhibitor mix (final concentrations of 6 μm leupeptin, 20 μm pepstatin A, 20 μm benzamidine, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min and loaded on a 0.5 ml column of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A containing 600 mm potassium acetate and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. After washing with 5 ml of buffer A containing 1.2 m potassium acetate and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 5 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm potassium acetate, proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 150 mm potassium acetate and 300 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Peak fractions (10 μl) were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Construction of GST Fusion Proteins and Antibody Production—The ORFs of yeast SSL1 and TFB4 genes were amplified by PCR and cloned between BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Bioscience). GST-Ssl1 and GST-Tfb4 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus cells (Strategene), grown in 500 ml of Luria broth at 37 °C to an A 600 value of 0.6–0.8, and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at room temperature. The cells were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder (5–10 min). After the cell powder was thawed, 50 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mix) was added, followed by stirring for 20 min at 4 °C, brief sonication, and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was loaded on a 3 ml column of GST-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 volumes of lysis buffer, followed by 10 volumes of lysis buffer without NaCl. GST fusion proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 10 mm glutathione and no NaCl. GST-Tfb4 was dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline, followed by concentration to 2 mg/ml in a Vivaspin 6m concentrator, 30,000 molecular weight cutoff (Vivascience). About 1 mg of GST-Tfb4 was used to inoculate a rabbit (Covance, PA). GST-Ssl1 was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The GST-Ssl1 protein band was excised and used to inoculate rabbits (Covance, PA). Construction of TAP-tagged Yeast Strains—Following the published protocol (29Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar), PCR was performed with pBS1458 as template and with primer sets targeting either TFB3 or TFB4 genomic loci. The PCR products were used to transform yeast strain CB010 (MATa, pep4::His, prb::Leu, prc1::HISG, can1, ade2, trp1, ura3, leu2–3, 112), yielding the yeast strains YT062 (TFB3-tagged) and YT063 (TFB4-tagged). Affinity Purification of TFIIH Complexes—Yeast strain YT062 or YT063 was grown in 7.5 liter of 2× YPD (4% (w/v) Bacto Peptone, 2% (w/v) yeast extract, 4% (w/v) glucose) to an A 600 value of 8–9. Cells were harvested, wash once with cold water, and the resulting cell pellets (∼180 g) were extruded into liquid nitrogen through a 60-ml syringe. The frozen cells were broken in liquid nitrogen essentially as described previously (30Boeger H. Griesenbeck J. Strattan J.S. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), using a 2-liter Waring blender at high speed for 10 min with constant addition of liquid nitrogen. About 160 g of broken cells were thawed at 4 °C and 230 ml of 0.27 m Tris acetate (pH 7.6), 1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.09 m potassium acetate, 1.8 mm EDTA, 18% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mix was added. The mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman JA14 rotor at 13,000 rpm for 20 min and then in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 42,000 rpm for 90 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to 60% of saturation, followed by centrifugation in a Beckman JA14 rotor at 13, 000 rpm for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing protease inhibitor mix, clarified by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 30 min, and loaded on a 0.8 ml IgG-agarose column (Sigma) equilibrated in buffer A containing 500 mm ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A containing 500 mm ammonium sulfate and with 10 ml of the buffer A containing 100 mm ammonium sulfate. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and eluted by incubation overnight in the same buffer containing TEV protease (40 μg/ml) at 4 °C. Peptide Sequence Analysis and Protein Identification—A phenyl column fraction of highly purified core TFIIH (60 μl), prepared as described previously (17Chang W.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 609-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was precipitated with 20% acetone in the cold and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The lowest molecular weight band, visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, was excised. The gel slice was dried in a SpeedVac. The protein was digested with trypsin, peptides were fractionated on a Poros 50 R2 RP micro-tip, and the resulting peptide pools were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight (MALDI-reTOF) MS using a Bruker UltraFlex TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics; Bremen, Germany), as described previously (31Erdjument-Bromage H.

Philip J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Svejstrup J.Q. Tempst P. Methods. 2002; 26: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Selected experimental masses (m/z) were then taken to search a non-redundant protein data base (∼1.4 × 106 entries; National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD), utilizing the PeptideSearch (Matthias Mann, Southern Denmark University, Odense, Denmark) algorithm. A molecular weight range twice the predicted weight was covered, with a mass accuracy restriction better than 40 ppm and maximum one missed cleavage site allowed per peptide. Mass spectrometric sequencing of selected peptides was done by MALDI-TOF/TOF (MS/MS) analysis on the same prepared samples, using the UltraFlex instrument in “LIFT” mode. Fragment ion spectra were then taken to search the non-redundant protein data base using the MASCOT MS/MS Ion Search program (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK). Any identification thus obtained was verified by comparing the computer-generated fragment ion series of the predicted tryptic peptide with the experimental MS/MS data. Immunoblot Analysis—Eluates (10 μl) of Ni-NTA or IgG columns were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Protran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with anti-Rad3, anti-Ssl1, anti-Tfb1, anti-Tfb2, anti-Tfb3, anti-Tfb4, anti-Ccl1, and anti-Kin28 antibodies. Detection was performed either with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad) followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad) followed by color development by the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium liquid substrate system (Sigma). Tfb4, but Not Tfb3, Supports Expression of Core TFIIH in Insect Cells—We set out to express yeast TFIIH in insect cells, beginning with the previously defined core complex of Rad3, Ssl1, Tfb1, Tfb2, and Tfb3. A monolayer of Sf21 cells was infected with a mixture of baculoviruses, each harboring a gene for one of the five proteins, with that for Tfb1 bearing a hexahistidine tag. Clarified cell extracts were applied to Ni-NTA resin and eluted with imidazole, and eluted proteins were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against the five proteins. Only Rad3, Tfb1, and Ssl1 were detected in the eluate (Fig. 1, lane 3). When the experiment was repeated, substituting a virus expressing Tfb4 for that expressing Tfb3, a five-subunit complex was obtained, as shown by the detection of all expressed proteins in the eluate (Fig. 1, lane 6). In control experiments, none of the antibodies showed significant cross-reactivity with proteins in an extract from uninfected cells, and neither Tfb3 nor Tfb4, expressed individually, was retained nonspecifically on Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 12). We conclude that Tfb4 is required for the assembly of a five-protein core complex, which does not include Tfb3. Peptide Sequence Determination Identifies the Smallest Subunit of Highly Purified Core TFIIH as TFB4 —The assembly of a core complex in insect cells with Tfb4 but not Tfb3 led us to question the previous assignment of the lowest molecular weight band in SDS gels of yeast core TFIIH preparations to Tfb3. As this assignment was based on mass spectroscopy of tryptic peptides derived from the gel band (24Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we repeated the analysis. We used a more recent, improved yeast core TFIIH preparation of sufficient purity for crystallization (17Chang W.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 609-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), the smallest band, of about 37 kDa, was excised, dried, and subjected to MALDI analysis. All peptide fragments detected had sequences derived from Tfb4 (Fig. 2B). We conclude that the smallest subunit of core TFIIH is Tfb4 and that the previous results arose from contamination by Tfb3, nearly identical in size to Tfb4. Affinity Purification of Tfb4 from Yeast Yields Core TFIIH, whereas Affinity Purification of Tfb3 Yields a cdk-cyclin-Tfb3 Complex—Despite the requirement for Tfb4 for assembly of a core TFIIH complex in insect cells, and despite the presence of Tfb4 along with four other proteins in a core TFIIH preparation from yeast, it still remains to be shown that all components of the core preparation are physically associated with one another. To this end, we expressed Tfb4 bearing a TAP tag in yeast. A crude extract was applied to an IgG column for binding the protein A moiety of the TAP tag, and specifically bound proteins were eluted by cleavage of the tag with TEV protease. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining showed (Fig. 3A), and immunoblotting confirmed (Fig. 3B) the enrichment of Rad3, Ssl1, Tfb1, and Tfb2, together with Tfb4 (bearing the residual CBP component of the TAP tag). After this single step of affinity purification, only a few impurities remained. When the alternative experiment was performed of expressing TAP-tagged Tfb3 rather than Tfb4, the eluate from the IgG column contained no core TFIIH subunits (Fig. 3). Rather, what emerged were apparently stoichiometric amounts of Tfb3 and the cdk-cyclin pair (Kin28 and Ccl1). Similar evidence for a Tfb3-cdk-cyclin complex has been reported elsewhere (28Keogh M.C. Cho E.J. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The results of affinity purification therefore support those from peptide sequence analysis and expression in insect cells, showing that Tfb4 is a subunit of core TFIIH, whereas Tfb3 is not. The results further demonstrate the association of Tfb3 with the cdk-cyclin pair, previously denoted TFIIK (10Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). With this realignment of subunits between core TFIIH and TFIIK, the compositions of the yeast complexes now correspond perfectly with their counterparts in human cells (Table I).Table IYeast TFIIH subunits and their human homologs We thank Drs. P. Fischhaber and E. C. Friedberg for anti-Rad3 antibody, L. Lacomis for help with mass spectrometry, and Dr. J. Griesenbeck for help preparing whole cell extracts."

https://openalex.org/W2051367437,"Hepatopoietin (HPO) is a novel hepatotrophic growth factor that stimulates hepatocyte proliferation by two pathways. In the first, intracellular HPO specifically modulates the activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathway through JAB1 (Jun activation domain-binding protein 1), whereas in the second, extracellular HPO triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by binding its specific receptor on the cell surface. In this report we demonstrate that HPO is a flavin-linked sulfhydryl oxidase, and the invariant CXXC (Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys) motif in HPO is essential for the enzyme activity of HPO but not for its dimerization nor for its binding ability with JAB1. Two intramolecular disulfides were identified in HPO by mass spectrometry, one of which is formed by the redox CXXC cysteine residues. HPO site-directed mutants (Cys/Ser) at active sites, which lost sulfhydryl oxidase activity, could not increase c-Jun phosphorylation and failed to potentiate JAB1-mediated AP-1 activation. However, the mutants still have mitogenic stimulation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation effects on HepG2 cells. Thus, it can be concluded that the potentiation role of HPO on AP-1 is dependent on its sulfhydryl oxidase activity.

Recombinant HPO can stimulate proliferation of hepatocytes as well as hepatoma cells in vitro, promote liver regeneration and recovery of damaged hepatocytes, and rescue acute hepatic failure in vivo (6.Yang X.M.

Furthermore, we proposed that extracellular HPO stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes and enhances liver regeneration by activating the MAPK signaling pathway under the mediation of HPO receptor (9.Li Y.

Intriguingly, we further found that intracellular HPO can specifically modulate the AP-1 pathway through JAB1 via a MAPK-independent pathway and that HPO enhances the increased phosphorylation level of c-Jun through JAB1 but has no effect on the expression of transfected c-Jun or endogenous c-Jun N-terminal kinase nor on phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (10.Lu C.R.

Cytokines and growth factors stimulate AP-1 activity through several pathways (11.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar), whereas the intracrine HPO regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity by an additional mechanism different from other cytokines and growth factors with mitogenic effects. It seems strange that intracellular and extracellular cytokine HPO have dissimilar actions in signal transduction. Recently, it was reported that the ERV1/HPO family belongs to sulfhydryl oxidase (SOX) participating in disulfide bond formation (12.Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T.

The SOX proteins contain a conserved CXXC motif and a non-covalent FAD adjacent to CXXC, which are vital to their catalytic activity (18.Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19.Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct.

Sulfhydryl oxidases generally form dimers in vivo and catalyze the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups to disulfides according to the general reaction 2R-SH + O2 → RSSR + H2O2 (18.Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which is different from the flavoprotein families (20.Massey V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HPO also has the CXXC motif and displays the homodimer form in vitro and in vivo (21.Li Y. Wei K.H. Lu C.R. Li Y.X. Li M. Xing G.C. Wei H.D. Qi Wang M. Chen J.Z. Wu C. Chen H.P. Yang S.C. He F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-6Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to hypothesize that the enzymatic function of HPO might provide an approach to uncover why HPO displays a dual nature. Although unusual for a cytokine, protein mediators have been shown previously to function both as a cytokine and as an enzyme. These peculiar proteins that display both cytokine and enzyme activities are called “cytozymes.” For example, human thioredoxin/adult T cell-derived factor is a disulfide reductase, but it is also an autocrine growth factor that has an extracellular growth-promoting effect. Intracellularly, thioredoxin/adult T cell-derived factor is involved in the regulation of protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions through the reduction/oxidation of protein cysteine residues (22.Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 23.Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo T. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown R. Arai K. Yokota T.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is another cytokine with a critical role in the immune and inflammatory response, but it is also a thiol oxidoreductase (24.Kleemann R Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W.

Burger-Kentischer A. Flieger O. Johannes F.J. Roger T. Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Macrophage migration inhibitory factor can specifically interact with JAB1 and then act broadly to negatively regulate JAB1-controlled pathways (25.Kleemann R. Hausser A. Geiger G. Mischke R. Burger-Kentischer A. Flieger O. Johannes F.J. Roger T. Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The evidence implies that the mechanism for the macrophage migration inhibitory factor-JAB1 antagonism might be enzyme-based but is not understood yet. Despite the important progress that has been made with respect to the elucidation of the biological role of cytozymes, the molecular mechanism of their actions has remained unclear, especially the precise relationship between the cytokine and enzyme activities. Whether the biological functions of HPO in mammals are created by its enzyme activity or its cytokine effect separately or by their interaction is a mystery. In this report we intend to discuss the relationship between the enzymatic activity and the intra/extracellular cytokine effects of HPO in cellular signal transduction. Considering the importance of the conserved CXXC motif of HPO in its SOX activity, the dimerization of HPO and HPO-JAB1 interaction in its cytokine effects, we investigated the alteration of these factors by single or double cysteine to serine site mutagenesis of CXXC. Then the mitogenic stimulation and MAPK activation effect by the extracellular HPO mutants were detected. We further investigated whether the intracrine HPO mutants could increase phospho-c-Jun levels and AP-1 activation. Here we demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of HPO might be a key regulator in intracellular mediation of the AP-1 pathway through JAB1. In-gel Digestion—Anaerobic purification is performed to avoid disulfide bridges formation, which may occur in aerobic purification. The isoelectric focus-separated HPO band with a pI 6.44 was excised, washed in 100 mm NH4HCO3, destained in 100 mm NH4HCO3, 50% ACN three times, and dried by vacuum (SpeedVac). The gel was rehydrated in 100 μl of bovine trypsin or Glu-C (Sigma) buffer (0.01 μg/μl) and incubated for 16 h. For Glu-C (Sigma) digestion, phosphate buffer of pH 4.0 was used. Peptide extraction was carried out first in 100 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid (Merck) at 40 °C and then in 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% ACN for 1 h. The resulting digest was dried in vacuum and dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% ACN for mass spectrometry analysis. Digest Reduction—The dried digest was dissolved in 10 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, 1 μl of DTT (10 μg/μl) was added at 50 °C for 1 h, and 10 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid was added for acidification and dilution. Mass Spectrometry—Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) of HPO was performed on Kratos Kompact SEQ matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV in positive mode. All spectra were acquired in linear mode. The matrix of α-cyano-4-hydroxylcinnic acid was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% ACN, and calibration was carried by external bovine insulin (5 pmol, Sigma). HPO open reading frame (390 base pairs, GenBank™ AF124603) (21.Li Y. Wei K.H. Lu C.R. Li Y.X. Li M. Xing G.C. Wei H.D. Qi Wang M. Chen J.Z. Wu C. Chen H.P. Yang S.C. He F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-6Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR. The in vitro cysteine to serine mutants of HPO (15 kDa) at positions 67, 70, 67/70, and 90 were constructed using the overlap extension PCR amplification method (26.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). JAB1 open reading frames were amplified by PCR using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-TG GCG GCG TCC GGG AGC GGT-3′; primer 2, 5′-CCG CTC GAG AGA GAT GTT AAT TT. All the sequences were verified by sequencing. The restriction sites NdeI and XhoI were used for cloning the PCR fragments into the hexahistidyl tag vector pET-24a (+) (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Clontech), and the C-terminal His6-tagged proteins were purified using a His6 spin purification kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Purification to homogeneity was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and by antibody tests. In a final step the proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The dialyzed HPO (wild type and mutants) proteins were directly used for spectroscopy. The absorption range is from 350 to 550 nm. Under identical conditions a reference of 7 μm pure FAD (Sigma) was measured. Preparation of reduced lysozyme (Sigma) as a substrate for HPO proteins was done as described elsewhere (27.Hoober K.L. Sheasley S.L. Gilbert H.F. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22147-22150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were done according to the protocol described by Jeung-Eun Lee et al. (12.Lee J.-E. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The recombinant His-tagged HPOs were expressed in E. coli (see above for details), and cells were prepared under nonreducing conditions. Aliquots were separated by a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel with or without 10 mm DTT in the sample buffer. The HPOwt and mutants (HPOC67S, HPOC70S, HPOC67S/C70S, HPOC90S) cDNAs were inserted into the pCMV-Myc expression vector (Clontech) in-frame with an Myc epitope. The pCMV-Myc-HPOs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells grown in 35-mm dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hy-Clone). Cell extracts were fractionated on 15% SDS/PAGE in the presence or absence of 10 mm DTT in the sample buffer. The proteins were blotted onto Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were first blocked by incubation in NaCl/Tris/Tween containing 5% fat-free milk overnight at 4 °C, sequentially incubated with mouse anti-His (C-term) monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) or mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and then detected by Western blotting luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Finally, the various Western-blotting bands were scanned by GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). The Matchmaker™ two-hybrid system 2 (Clontech) was used according to the manufacturer's protocols for interaction assay. Different combinations of the cDNAs encoding HPOwt (15 kDa) or its mutants in pACT2 (AD vector) and the cDNA of JAB1 in pAS2 (DNA-BD vector) were cotransfected into Y190 cells and plated on the SD/Trp–Leu–His– triple-selection medium (Clontech). The binding ability between different HPO and JAB1 was quantified by the liquid galactosidase assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech), and the β-galactosidase activity was expressed in Miller units. For pull-down experiments, 100 μg of purified recombinant His-JAB1 fusion protein (see above for details) was immobilized on 100 μl (resuspended 50% bed resin) of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose Beads (Qiagen), incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then washed with 50 volumes of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0. The plasmids of pCMV-Myc-HPO (wild type and mutants) were transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After being transfected for 24 h, the cells were rinsed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0 (Qiagen), with a mixture of protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) by sonication on ice. Six 15-s bursts at 75 W were used, with a 10-s cooling period between each burst. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, and the crude protein extracts (1 mg) were incubated with the His-JAB1 fusion protein-immobilized nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, then washed twice with 50 volumes of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0, and eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0 (Qiagen). The elution was detected by anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. The blots were revealed by Western blotting luminol reagent. The full-length cDNA of JAB1 was subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The HPO (wild type and mutants) cDNAs were inserted into the pCMV-Myc expression vector in-frame with a Myc epitope. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with both pcDNA3-JAB1 coding for JAB1 and either pCMV-Myc-HPO coding for Myc-HPO fusion or pCMV-Myc coding for only Myc using LipofectAMINE 2000. After 24 h of transfection, the cells in a 24-cm2 flask (Corning) were rinsed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 2 μm NaF, 2% Tween 20, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and mixture protease inhibitor) for 30 min on ice and sonicated by 3 10-s bursts at 75 W with a 10-s cooling period between each burst. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of the supernatant was separated and used for Western blot analysis to compare protein expression levels. For co-immunoprecipitation, 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to 900 μl of the cell lysate and incubated 4 h at 4 °C for preimmunoprecipitation. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with a rabbit anti-JAB1 polyclonal antibody (for JAB1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 4 h. The purified rabbit IgG was incubated as a control antibody with another set of supernatant in comparison with the rabbit anti-JAB1 antibody. 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads was then added to the reaction for another 16 h of incubation at 4 °C. Finally, the agarose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for immunoblot analysis. For Western blot analysis the polyacrylamide gel was transferred to a Hybond-P membrane. Duplicate blots were made from the same set of immunoprecipitation experiments. One blot was probed with mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody to detect Myc-HPO in the JAB1-Myc-HPO immunocomplex, and the other was probed with a rabbit anti-JAB1 antibody to monitor the amount of JAB1 protein that had been immunoprecipitated by the anti-JAB1 antibody in each reaction. The blots were revealed by Western blotting luminol reagent. HepG2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were changed to serum-free DMEM 48 h before stimulation to eliminate hormones and growth factors and then stimulated for 12 h with recombinant human hepatopoietin (rhHPO) wild type or mutants (50 ng/ml) with equal volumes of DMEM or with 10% serum DMEM. The cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (5 μCi/well) for 8 h and harvested onto glass fiber filters. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured in a scintillation counter. Identification of MEK and MAPK activation by HPOs (Wild Type and Mutants)—HepG2 cells were cultured without serum for 48 h before stimulation with 50 ng/ml rhHPOwt or its mutants for 5 min. Cell lysates (50 mg) were fractionated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-P membranes, and probed with antibodies against phospho-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), or phospho-MAPK or MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) (Promega). COS-7 cells were plated on 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning) at a density of 5 × 104/well and cotransfected with AP-1-driven luciferase reporter gene (Stratagene) together with the indicated cDNAs using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). The AP-1-driven luciferase reporter gene is a reporter plasmid encoding for the firefly luciferase gene driven by several copies of an AP-1 enhancer. The indicated cDNAs were: pcDNA3-c-Jun, coding for c-Jun; pcDNA3-JAB1, coding for JAB1; pcDNA3-HPO coding for HPO; pcDNA3-HPOΔ1–60, coding for deleted HPO (amino acids 1–60); pcDNA3-HPOC67S, HPOC70S, HPOC67S/C70S, and HPOC90S, coding for HPO mutants. Total DNA was kept constant by the addition of the appropriate amount of pcDNA3 for all transfections. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity by using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. To normalize the transfection efficiency, the firefly luciferase activity was divided by the Renilla luciferase activity from the internal control vector of pRL-TK (Promega). COS-7 cells were plated on 35-mm tissue culture plates (Corning) at a density of 1 × 105/well and cotransfected with pcDNA3-c-Jun, pcDNA3-JAB1, and pcDNA3-HPOwt, HPOΔ1–60, HPOC67S, HPOC70S, HPOC67S/C70S, and HPOC90S using the FuGENE 6 reagent. Total DNA was kept constant by the addition of the appropriate amount of pcDNA3 for all transfections. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and detected by immunoblotting. Lysozyme, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), FAD, and DTT were from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies against active MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 were from Promega. Monoclonal mouse antibody against 15-kDa human HPO was generated against bacterially produced recombinant protein by our laboratory. Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-MEK1/2 and MEK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Polyclonal anti-c-Jun, anti-JAB1, anti-actin antibodies, monoclonal anti-p-c-Jun antibodies, protein A/G PLUS-agarose, and Western-blotting luminol reagent were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat, and anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc. Hybond-P membrane were from Amersham Biosciences. Identification of Two Intramolecular Disulfide Bonds of HPO by Mass Spectrometry—The SOX protein has a redox-active disulfide bridge formed by the enzyme active site CXXC cysteine residues, whereas the thiol-disulfide state of HPO is not clear. Thus, we performed the following experiments by mass spectrometry with 15-kDa rhHPO, resulting in the identification of two intramolecular disulfide bonds. Peptide mass fingerprinting before and after DTT reduction of HPO tryptic digests showed that there were four peptides involving disulfide bonds (Fig. 1, A and B). The base peak of m/z 1970.4 shifted to m/z 1971.9 after reduction, so there was an intramolecular disulfide bond in this peptide. The sequence of this peptide (searched by disulfide bond analysis software Ssanalyzer) is ACFTQWLCHLHNEVNR, with the disulfide bond formed between Cys-90 and Cys-96. The Glu-C PMF before/after DTT reduction agreed with this result since there was a similar m/z shift, from m/z 2115.2 to m/z 2117.3, corresponding to the sequence TRTRACFTQWLCHLHNE (Fig. 1, C and D). The other intramolecular disulfide bond, formed between Cys-67 and Cys-70, was also identified by m/z shift in PMFs before/after DTT reduction; the shift was from m/z 1473.7 to m/z 1475.5 in tryptic PMF and from m/z 2292.4 to m/z 2294.8 in Glu-C PMF, corresponding to the sequences FYPCEECAEDLR and MAQFIHLFSKFYPCEECAE, respectively. Of the 8 cysteines in the 15-kDa HPO molecule, 4 take part in the formation of two internal disulfide bounds (Fig. 1E). The one between Cys-67 and Cys-70 agrees with the SOX redox-active disulfide, which is adjacent to FAD moiety. The other disulfide bound between Cys-90 and Cys-96 has been identified for the first time. The CXXC motif and the redox-active disulfide are conserved in Erv1p, Erv2p, 15-kDa rat ALR and 15-kDa HPO. However, their disulfide bridges are different because of amino acid sequence disagreements (28.Hofhaus G. Lee J.E. Tews I. Rosenberg B. Lisowsky T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29.Wu C.K. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Rose J.P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). HPO (15 kDa) Is a FAD-linked Sulfhydryl Oxidase and the CXXC Motif Is Essential for its Enzymatic Activity—HPO exists as 2 isoforms at 15 and 23 kDa in liver cells (21.Li Y. Wei K.H. Lu C.R. Li Y.X. Li M. Xing G.C. Wei H.D. Qi Wang M. Chen J.Z. Wu C. Chen H.P. Yang S.C. He F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-6Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The different spliced forms of HPO not only reside in various cellular locations but also might have different functions. To examine the FAD-linked SOX activity of 15-kDa HPO, 3 cysteine to serine mutants of CXXC active disulfide bound were designed: HPOC67S, HPOC70S, and HPOC67S/C70S. Cys-90 in another internal disulfide was also changed into serine (HPOC90S) as a control. We expressed the C terminus hexahistidyl-tagged recombinant proteins of HPO wild type and mutants in E. coli and purified them to homogeneity. Then the dialyzed proteins were directly used for spectroscopy to identify the bound FAD. The purified proteins are bright yellow after 24 h of dialysis at 4 °C, and Fig. 2 shows that the HPO protein spectra are all characteristic for a FAD moiety but exhibit distinct differences from free FAD. The absorbance maximum of free FAD at 450 nm is shifted by about 5 nm in the wild type HPO protein. The HPO Cys → Ser mutant (at positions Cys-67, Cys-70, Cys-67/Cys-70 and Cys-90) proteins can still bind FAD, indicating that they fold normally when overexpressed in E. coli. The FAD content of the protein was calculated from the absorption at 460 nm by using an extinction coefficient of 10 mm/cm, a value that is typical for flavin-containing proteins (27.Hoober K.L.

We demonstrated three distinct conformational changes of the proteinase that occur during complex formation and distortion.

Hansen M. Jensen J.K. Andreasen P.A. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of PAI-1, typical of all members of the serpin superfamily, consists of three β-sheets, nine α-helices, and an exposed flexible reactive center loop (RCL). PAI-1 is found in a metastable conformational state, which facilitates the kinetic trapping of its target proteinases in thermodynamically favorable covalent complexes (2Engh R.A. Huber R. Bode W. Schulze A.J. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 503-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The serpin inhibition mechanism is initiated by the formation of a non-covalent Michaelis complex between the exposed RCL of the inhibitor and the active site of the target proteinase. Following docking, the catalytic cleavage of the RCL triggers a rapid translocation of the proteinase to the opposite pole of the inhibitor, trapping the enzyme as a stable proteinase-inhibitor complex. The ability of the serpin to maintain a stable complex with its target proteinase is partly due to distortion of the catalytic triad through compression of the proteinase against the body of the inhibitor, thereby preventing catalytic deacylation and release of the proteinase. Distortion of the proteinase has been clearly demonstrated in a crystallographic study in which 37% of the proteinase was shown to adopt a disordered structure within the trypsin-α1-antitrypsin complex (Fig. 1) (3Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the catalytic serine (Ser-195) has been pulled more than 6 Å away from the His-57 residue, preventing proton transfer from the histidine to the serine and subsequent catalytic deacylation by the proteinase (3Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Distortion of the proteinase has also been monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence within thrombin following its inhibition by an α1-antitrypsin variant in which both native tryptophan residues were mutated to phenylalanine (4Tew D.J. Bottomley S.P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Several additional studies have also examined the distortion of the proteinase active site using [1H-15N]HSQC NMR (5Peterson F.C. Gettins P.G.

Whereas previous studies have characterized both the structure and disordered state of the proteinase within the complex, the static nature of these techniques restricts knowledge of the steps leading to the final conformational state of the complex. An understanding of the kinetic steps involved in obtaining this final complexed state would provide greater insight into the overall mechanism by which a serpin inhibits its target proteinase. To better define the kinetic steps involved in distortion of the serine proteinase and kinetic trapping, we utilized the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of tPA. Tryptophan fluorescence has been extensively exploited to study protein structure/function by providing a useful signal to monitor conformational changes within the protein. Although this technique is extremely useful with a single protein, fluorescence changes are difficult to interpret when observing intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence changes in the presence of multiple proteins. The biosynthetic incorporation of tryptophan analogs has greatly facilitated the study of structure/function relationships within multiple component systems by altering the spectral properties of one of the proteins (10Ross J.B. Szabo A.G. Hogue C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 151-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Wong C.Y. Eftink M.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Studies characterizing staphylococcal nuclease incorporated with 4-fluorotryptophan demonstrated that the analog is capable of “fluorescently knocking-out” the protein when excited at 300 nm (12Wong C.Y. Eftink M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8938-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, the four native tryptophans of PAI-1 were substituted with 7-azatryptophan to red-shift the absorbance, allowing the structural transitions within PAI-1 to be monitored by specifically exciting the 7-azatryptophan in the presence of tPA (13Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study, we have developed a novel PAI-1 variant in which all four native tryptophan residues were biosynthetically replaced with 4-fluorotryptophan, successfully silencing all of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence within the PAI-1 molecule without affecting function. Thus, we were able to isolate the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of tPA and observe conformational changes associated with both formation of the non-covalent Michaelis complex and distortion of tPA during its inhibition by PAI-1. Our findings indicate that the rate of tPA distortion is identical to the rate of stable proteinase-inhibitor complex formation, demonstrating that distortion of the proteinase coincides with its trapping by the inhibitor. Materials and Reagents—Unless otherwise indicated, all of the experiments were preformed in 30 mm HEPES, 0.135 m NaCl, and 1.0 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) at 25 °C. Acrylic cuvettes were coated with 0.1% polyethylene glycol to reduce protein adsorption. The chromogenic substrate SpectrozymetPA (CH3 SO2-d-HHT-Gly-Arg-pNA) was obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. All of the chromatography equipment used for protein purification was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All of the other reagents were of analytical grade or better and were obtained from Sigma. PAI-1 Mutagenesis, Incorporation, and Expression of 4-F PAI-1—Recombinant human PAI-1 was a kind gift from David Ginsburg (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ann Arbor, MI) and was provided in the pET3a vector. The PAI-1 gene was further cloned into the pET24d expression plasmid as described previously (13Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The tryptophan knock-out (TrpKO) PAI-1, a PAI-1 mutant in which all four tryptophan residues have been replaced with phenylalanine, was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis using the Muta-Gene Phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) using the manufacturer's recommended protocol and the method of Kunkel (14Kunkel T.A.

The oligonucleotides used to generate the phenylalanine residues at positions 86, 139, 175, and 262 (PAI-1 numbering) were 5′-342dGATCTCATCCTTGTTAAATGGCCCCATGAGCT311-3′, 5′-501dTGTGTGTGTCTTCACAAAGTCATTGATGATGA470-3′, 5′-609dGGGGAAGGGAGTCTTAAACTGGCCGTTGAAGT578-3′, and 5′-870dGGTCATGTTGCCTTTGAAGTGGCTGATGAGCT839-3′, respectively. The mutagenesis of PAI-1 was confirmed by sequencing the entire PAI-1 gene. TrpKO and wtPAI-1 were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)pLysS, respectively, and purified as described previously (13Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 4-F PAI-1 was expressed in the E. coli strain W3110TrpA33(DE3)pLysS using the one-step analog incorporation method described previously (13Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The incorporation efficiency of 4-fluorotryptophan into PAI-1 was determined at the protein structure facility of the University of Michigan by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy of 4-F PAI-1 in 1% acetic acid. A four-point external calibration curve was applied to the spectra to obtain better than a 0.1% mass accuracy. Protein concentrations for wtPAI-1 were determined using the absorbance at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 0.93 ml mg-1 cm-1 and a Mr of 43,000 (16Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D.

TrpKO and 4-F PAI-1 concentrations were determined with the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) using active wtPAI-1 of known concentration as a standard. Proteinases—Recombinant tPA (Activase®) and the mutant in which serine 195 has been replaced by an alanine (Ala-tPA), rendering the proteinase catalytically inactive, were provided by Genentech, Inc. The primarily single chain form of tPA was converted to two-chain tPA (tc-tPA) by passage over a 1.0-ml plasmin-Sepharose HiTrap column for approximately 1 h at 25 °C as described previously (18Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The proteinase domain of tPA (P-tPA) consisting of only the catalytic domain of tPA in which the two kringle domains, the epidermal growth factor domain (EGF) and the fibronectin finger-like domain, have been removed was prepared from full-length tPA as described previously (19Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Single chain form of tPA was passed over a 1.0-ml plasmin-Sepharose HiTrap column for 18 h at 37 °C. The proteinase domain was purified from the kringle, EGF, and fibronectin domains by reducing the tc-tPA with 3.0 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 30 min and then passing the mixture over a lysine-Sepharose column equilibrated in 0.1 m NaPO4 and 3.0 mm dithiothreitol at pH 8.0. P-tPA was collected in the flow-through fraction while the kringle and EGF domains remained bound to the lysine-Sepharose column. The concentration of tc-tPA was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.9 ml mg-1 cm-1 and a Mr value of 63,500. The concentration of functional P-tPA was determined by active site titration with p-aminobenzamidine using a standard curve, which was determined by titrating known concentrations of tc-tPA (0-1.7 μm) into 600 μmp-aminobenzamidine (20Evans S.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3014-3017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data were fit to a linear equation, and the concentration of the P-tPA was extrapolated from the fluorescence following reaction with 600 μmp-aminobenzamidine. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence of WT, TrpKO, and 4-F PAI-1—Fluorescence spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier controlled cell holder. Unless otherwise noted, all of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra were obtained using 0.5 μm proteinase and 1.0-2.0 μm inhibitor at 25 °C with an excitation wavelength of 305 nm and excitation and emission slit-widths of 2.5 nm and 5.0 nm, respectively. Emission spectra were collected from 315-410 nm with a 1.0-nm step, and each data point was integrated until the signal (noise ratio was greater than 1000 with a 10-s cutoff). Stoichiometry of Inhibition—The stoichiometry of inhibition (S.I.), defined as the number of moles of PAI-1 required to inhibit one mole of tPA or P-tPA, was determined by measuring the residual proteinase activity following reaction with WT, 4-F, or TrpKO PAI-1 by monitoring the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate SpectrozymetPA as described previously (13Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Reactions containing 130 nm proteinase were incubated with 0-150 nm inhibitor at 25 °C for 60 min. The reaction was diluted 10-fold into standard HEPES buffer with 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 0.1 mm SpectrozymetPA, and the reaction progress was monitored by the absorbance at 405 nm. Residual proteinase activity was plotted against the molar ratio of inhibitor to proteinase, and the S.I. was extrapolated from the X-intercept of the best-fit linear regression to the data. Apparent Second Order Rate Constant for Inhibition of Proteinases by PAI-1—The apparent second order rate constant of inhibition (kapp) for each proteinase was determined using the competitive kinetic method (21Tian W.X. Tsou C.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) under pseudo-first order conditions as described elsewhere (18Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Reactions containing 2-30 nm proteinase were reacted with 25-175 nm of each PAI-1 variant in standard HEPES buffer with 0.5 mm SpectrozymetPA at 25 °C. The reaction was monitored at 405 nm for 150-600 s, and the progress curves were fit to a single exponential equation with a steady-state linear component to derive kobs. The kapp value was determined by correcting kobs for substrate competition (1+ [So]/Km) and then dividing by the functional inhibitor concentration (corrected for S.I.) (23Hood D.B. Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The Km of spectrozymetPA for tc-tPA has been previously reported as 77.9 μm (35Blouse G.E. Perron M.J.

The Km for P-tPA hydrolysis of spectrozymetPA was determined to be 145.0 μm using standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Rapid Acid-quenching Technique to Determine the Limiting Rate of Serpin-Proteinase Complex Formation—The formation of SDS stable proteinase-inhibitor complexes was monitored using the rapid acid-quenching technique as described elsewhere (18Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Reactions were preformed under pseudo-first order conditions in which the proteinase (4.0 μm) was in 4-fold excess over inhibitor (1.0 μm) to ensure saturation of the Michaelis complex. The limiting rates (klim) for generation of inhibited complex were determined by fitting the progress curves to a single exponential equation and are reported as klim ± S.E. of the fit. Stopped-flow Kinetics to Monitor Conformational Changes in the Proteinase—The conformational changes in tc-tPA and P-tPA following reaction with 4-F PAI-1 were monitored on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer with a 25 °C thermostated syringe chamber. To monitor changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, the reaction was excited at 300 nm and the emission fluorescence was monitored using a filter (Oreil 51255) with a cutoff below 310 nm. Unless otherwise noted, stopped-flow experiments were carried out under pseudo-first order conditions with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor (0.2-3.0 μm) in at least 4-fold excess over proteinase (0.05-0.3 μm). All of the stopped-flow traces were best fit using a nonlinear double exponential equation yielding kobs1 and kobs2. The kobs data were then fit to a rectangular hyperbola, kobs = klim[I]o/Km + [I]o, where klim is the limiting rate observed for the conformational change associated with the observed change in fluorescence, [I]o is the inhibitor concentration, and Km is the concentration at which the kobs is half of the klim and is defined as (klim + koff)/kon where kon and koff are the forward and reverse rates for the formation of the non-covalent Michaelis complex, respectively. Characterization of 4-F and TrpKO PAI-1—To characterize the mechanism of proteinase distortion following complex formation, we monitored the fluorescence changes of tryptophan residues within the proteinase. To ensure that the changes in tryptophan fluorescence are solely attributed to conformational transitions within the proteinase, it is necessary to obviate tryptophan fluorescence changes within PAI-1 during the inhibition reaction. Previous work by Tew et al. (4Tew D.J. Bottomley S.P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) monitored conformational changes in thrombin during complex formation with α1-antitrypsin by mutating the two tryptophan residues at positions 194 and 238 in the serpin to observe the tryptophan fluorescence changes in thrombin. In this study, we have included a similar mutant, TrpKO PAI-1, in which all four native tryptophan residues (86, 139, 175, and 262, PAI-1 numbering) in PAI-1 were replaced with phenylalanine. In addition, we have created a variant of PAI-1 in which all four tryptophan residues are biosynthetically replaced with the non-fluorescent 4-fluorotryptophan analog. Biosynthetic incorporation of 4-fluorotryptophan into PAI-1 was performed using the one-step method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Previously, we have shown that this method limits expression of PAI-1 prior to induction, thereby maximizing analog incorporation efficiency (13Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The efficiency of 4-fluorotryptophan incorporation into PAI-1 was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy by comparing the mass of 4-F PAI-1 to that of wtPAI-1. Both the wtPAI-1 and 4-F PAI-1 spectrum consisted of only one major component with calculated masses of 42,633 and 42,700 daltons, respectively. The 67-dalton increase in the mass observed for 4-F PAI-1 is within experimental error of the 72-dalton increase expected for complete analog incorporation of wtPAI-1 (data not shown). The absorbance spectrum of 4-F PAI-1 exhibited a 21.5% decrease in absorbance at 280 nm and is blue-shifted compared with wtPAI-1, consistent with the altered absorbance properties because of the presence of the incorporated analog (Fig. 2). The absorbance of TrpKO PAI-1 was decreased by 83.3% at 280 nm, which was expected given that all four tryptophan residues were mutated to phenylalanine. The residual absorbance within TrpKO PAI-1 (16.7%) is probably because of the absorbance of tyrosine and phenylalanine residues within the inhibitor. To characterize the fluorescence profile of 4-F PAI-1 and TrpKO PAI-1, fluorescence emission scans were performed at an excitation wavelength of 305 nm and compared with those of wtPAI-1 (Fig. 3). Similar decreases in fluorescence of 90.3 and 89.1% were observed for 4-F PAI-1 and TrpKO, respectively, when compared with the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of wtPAI-1. The similar decrease in fluorescence observed for both 4-F PAI-1 and TrpKO PAI-1 suggests that the small level of 4-F PAI-1 fluorescence is probably because of excitation of tyrosine residues at 305 nm. The mass spectrometry data, absorbance profiles, and fluorescence scans all support the conclusion that 4-F PAI-1 has a 4-fluorotryptophan incorporation efficiency of >95%. Furthermore, the fluorescence data suggest that the incorporation of 4-fluorotryptophan into PAI-1 effectively silences the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence when excited at 305 nm, similar to that of TrpKO PAI-1.Fig. 3Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of wtPAI-1, 4-F PAI-1, and TrpKO PAI-1. Emission wavelength scans were preformed on 0.5 μm of each PAI-1 variant. Tryptophan residues were excited at 305 nm while the fluorescence emission was monitored from 310-410 nm.

To determine whether the incorporation of 4-fluorotryptophan into PAI-1 altered the kinetic inhibition mechanism, the S.I., apparent second order rate constant for inhibition (kapp), and the limiting rate constant for inhibition (klim) were determined using both tc-tPA and the P-tPA as target proteinases (Table I). The S.I. values for reactions of 4-F PAI-1 with tc-tPA were in close agreement with those obtained for wtPAI-1 (1.10 versus 1.14), indicating that incorporation of 4-fluorotryptophan has no significant effect on the partitioning between the substrate and inhibitor branches of the serpin mechanism with tc-tPA as the target proteinase. For reactions with P-tPA, there was a relatively small increase in S.I. (1.13 versus 1.42), suggesting a minor effect of the analog substitution on the partitioning step in the absence of the accessory domains. In contrast, the TrpKO PAI-1 mutant showed a marked increase in the S.I. to a value of 3.12, indicating that ∼68% of the inhibitor becomes hydrolyzed as a substrate following loop cleavage by tc-tPA.Table IKinetic data for wild type PAI-1, 4-fluorotryptophan PAI-1, and TrpKO PAI-1 with tPA and P-tPA All of the kinetic experiments were performed in 0.03 m HEPES, 0.135 m NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA at pH 7.4 and 25 °C and are reported as the average ± S.E.wtPAI-14-Fluorotryptophan PAI-1TrpKOPAI-1tPAP-tPAtPAP-tPAtPAS.I.1.10 ± 0.011.13 ± 0.011.14 ± 0.011.42 ± 0.013.12 ± 0.01kapp (μM-1S-1)15.4aData previously published (13)1.6 ± 0.111.3 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.01klim (S-1)3.4bData previously published (35)1.2 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.10.08 ± 0.01a Data previously published (13Blouse G.E.

The molecular determinants responsible for the ability of MEKK1 to recognize specific substrates are poorly understood. We report here that select point mutations in subdomain VIII of the protein kinase domain of MEKK1 (MEKK1Δ) differentially affect its ability to activate MKK4 and IKK, and consequently AP1 and NF-κB reporter genes. Moreover, binding of MKK4 to MEKK1Δ protects the latter from cleavage at an engineered protease target site in subdomain VIII.

They regulate a host of cellular processes including gene transcription, protein synthesis, the cell cycle, differentiation, and cell death (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol.

They consist of a three-tiered cascade in which a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) phosphorylates and activates a MAPK kinase (MAP2K), which in turn phosphorylates and activates a MAPK. A central feature of the phosphorylation events is that they occur in the activation loop located in subdomain VIII of the protein kinases. MAPK pathways in mammalian cells take their names from the terminal kinases of the cascade and include the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase, also known as stress-activated protein kinase), and p38 pathways. The JNK and p38 pathways are typically responsive to stressful stimuli, such as UV irradiation and proinflammatory cytokines, whereas the ERK pathway is typically responsive to growth factors.A notable feature of MAP3Ks is that they participate in the activation of a distinct signal-induced pathway, the NF-κB pathway. In this pathway, MAP3Ks directly activate IκB kinase (IKK), the central kinase of the NF-κB pathway. IKK, in turn, phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, targeting it for degradation and thereby allowing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (5Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). IKK also phosphorylates the p100 subunit of NF-κB, thereby promoting its processing to p52 (6Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M.

Blank J.L. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The preferential substrate of MEKK1 is MKK4, a MAP2K of the JNK pathway (14Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). MKK4, in turn, activates JNK (15Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar), which then phosphorylates c-Jun, a component of the AP1 transcription complex (16Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B.

MEKK1-deficient cells display defects in JNK activation in response to stimuli such as microtubule disruption, hyperosmolarity, double-stranded RNA, and lipopolysaccharide (18Yujiri T. Sather S.

The role of MEKK1 in tumor necrosis factor α-and interleukin-1β-induced JNK activation is more controversial (18Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L.

Although gene-targeting experiments revealed either more modest or no defects in activation of the ERK or NF-κB pathways, respectively (18Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 19Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7272-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), MEKK1 can activate MEK1 and therefore the ERK pathway (21Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), and also has the capacity to activate IKK and therefore the NF-κB pathway (22Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 23Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Thus, MEKK1 provides an opportunity to study mechanisms by which specificity in these pathways may be achieved.Direct protein/protein contacts between kinases of a cascade are one important means by which this specificity is maintained. An example of this is a docking interaction that occurs outside of the active site. In the case of the binding of the MAP2K MKK3b to the MAPK p38, recent x-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that this interaction occurs between the N terminus of the former and a docking groove in the latter contributed by subdomains V and VI (24Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have also identified charged residues in subdomain VI (the ED domain) and in a C-terminal extension distal to subdomain XI (the CD domain) of MAPK as being critical to this docking interaction (25Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 26Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Although these charged residues were not directly implicated in the structural studies, which employed an MKK3b N-terminal peptide, they are in the vicinity of the docking groove (24Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).Deletion of the N terminus (residues 1-77) of MKK4 abolishes its activation by tumor necrosis factor α (14Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that a homologous docking interaction might also mediate the interaction of MKK4 and the upstream kinase MEKK1. However, although MKK4 residues 1-87 alone are sufficient for binding to JNK, it is not for binding to MEKK1 (14Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, even if this docking interaction were to play a role in the MEKK1/MKK4 interaction, additional contacts must exist. In this regard, we have reported that select amino acid mutations of subdomain X of MEKK1 abolish its ability to bind to and activate MKK4 (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A similar though not identical set of mutations also displays effects on MEKK2 (28Huang J. Tu Z. Lee F.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A major limitation of the mutations in those studies, however, is that they compromised the ability of MEKK1 to not only activate MKK4, but also MKK7, IKK, and MEK1 (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, these mutants do not provide an explanation for how MEKK1 can distinguish between substrates, and even raise the possibility that some of these mutants might be structurally compromised. We therefore extended these studies, and in the present report we provide evidence that select residues in subdomain VIII contribute to the means by which MEKK1 targets distinct substrates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—pcDNA3-His6-MEKK1Δ (encoding residues 1174-1493 of mouse MEKK1), pcDNA3-His6-MEKK1Δ (F1443A), pcDNA3-HA-rMEKK1 (encoding full-length MEKK1), and pCMV2-FLAG-MKK4 were described previously (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).

The resulting constructs both lack the coding sequence for the His6 tag. The sources of all other plasmids have been described previously (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (29Tu Z. Kelley V.R. Collins T. Lee F.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6839-6846Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Typically, the cells were split the day prior to transfection so as to achieve 60-80% confluence, and then transfected using a 2:1 FuGENE/DNA ratio. Cells were harvested twenty-four to forty-eight hours post-transfection. For luciferase assays, HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression constructs of interest, 0.2 μg of pAP1-Luc or pNFκB-Luc, and 0.05 μg of pRL-TK. In the case of wild type or mutant pcDNA3-HA-rMEKK1, COS-1 cells were employed. Luciferase activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) and a Wallac LB9507 Luminometer.Western Blotting—Cell processing, SDS-PAGE, and membrane transfer have been described previously (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The membranes were then blotted with anti-HA polyclonal (sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MEKK1 polyclonal (sc-252, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IKKα/β polyclonal (sc-7607, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-myc monoclonal (9E10, University of Pennsylvania Cell Center), anti-FLAG monoclonal (M2, Sigma), or anti-phospho-MKK4 (Thr-261) polyclonal (catalog number 9151, Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies.Protein Kinase Assays—Immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as previously described (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cell lysates transiently expressing recombinant proteins of interest were subjected to immunoprecipitation by the addition of anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose, anti-myc antibodies (9E10, University of Pennsylvania Cell Center), anti-IKKα/β antibodies (sc-7607, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA antibodies (sc-805, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-MEKK1 antibodies (sc-252, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by rocking. In case of the anti-myc, anti-IKKα/β, anti-HA, and anti-MEKK1 immunoprecipitations, protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) was then added to each sample and rocked. The resins were washed and then incubated with GST-JNK1 (K55R), GSTIκBα(5-55), or His6-ERK2, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Products were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Protein kinase activities were quantitated using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 860 PhosphorImager. For assay of MEKK1Δ kinase activity, COS-1 cells transiently expressing wild type or mutant MEKK1Δ were lysed in buffer L (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Five μl of these lysates were incubated with GSTMKK4(K131A) in buffer K (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) containing 100 μm ATP. The reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and examined by Western blotting with an antibody against phospho-MKK4 (Thr-261) (Cell Signaling Technology). Recombinant His6-FLAG-MKK4 and His6-FLAGIKKβ were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells, and GSTMKK4(K131A), GST-JNK1 (K55R), and GST-IκBα(5-55) from Escherichia coli as described previously (22Lee F.S.

Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). His6-ERK2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Binding Assays—Lysates of COS-1 cells transiently expressing wild type or mutant MEKK1Δ prepared as above were mixed with either corresponding lysates containing transiently expressed FLAG-MKK4, or 4 μg of recombinant His6-FLAG-IKKβ. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking and then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were then washed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence or absence of MEKK1Δ was examined by Western blotting using anti-MEKK1 antibodies.Furin Limited Proteolysis—In vitro-translated MEKK1Δ and MEKK1Δ (QQ/RR) were prepared from pBluescript-MEKK1Δ and pBluescript-MEKK1Δ (QQ/RR), respectively, using TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysates (Promega) and both [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (each at 1000 Ci/mmol) as the labeling residues. In vitro-translated MEKK1Δ and MEKK1Δ (QQ/RR) were incubated, with rocking, for 2 h at 4 °C with either 2 μg of anti-MEKK1 antibodies (sc-252, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 10 μl of protein G-agarose (Invitrogen), or 2 μg of His6-FLAG-MKK4 and 10 μl of anti-FLAG (M2) agarose (Sigma). The resins were then washed twice with buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and once with furin reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoeth-anol). The immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C in a total of 20 μl of reaction buffer with four units of furin (New England Biolabs), and eluted by the addition of 2× SDS loading buffer followed by heating at 100 °C for 3 min. The elutates were then subjected to 16% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.RESULTSMutations in Subdomain VIII of MEKK1Δ Diminish Its AP1-and NF-κB-inducing Activity—In a previous study (27Tu Z. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we suggested that Phe-1443 of subdomain X of MEKK1 might be a contact residue for MKK4. This, in turn, raises the possibility that residues in areas adjacent to subdomain X in the tertiary structure of MEKK1 could be contact sites for MKK4. In JNK2, the sequence between subdomain IX and X (residues 208-230) largely accounts for its higher affinity to c-Jun (30Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R.

Thus, we first examined residues N-terminal to F1443. Three charged residues, Glu-1433, Lys-1434, and His-1435, in this region were simultaneously replaced by alanine. This mutation, however, did not affect the binding of MEKK1Δ to MKK4, its kinase activity toward GST-MKK4, or its ability to activate either an AP1 or NF-κB reporter gene (data not shown), suggesting that these charged residues N-terminal to Phe-1443 in subdomain X are not contact sites for MKK4.Another potential contact site for MKK4 is subdomain VIII, and there is evidence that subdomain VIII is involved in protein/protein interactions with other protein kinases. For example, p21-activated kinase 1 is present in a latent form due to an interaction with an inhibitory switch domain, and residues in subdomain VIII (Val-436, Arg-438, and Lys-439) form critical parts of this contact (these residues are underlined in Fig. 1A) (31Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In addition, Pro-202 and Leu-205 of subdomain VIII (underlined in Fig. 1A) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase α participate in binding of this kinase to its peptide substrates (32Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar).Thus, we examined the potential involvement of subdomain VIII, which is variably conserved among MAP3Ks (Fig. 1A), by performing alanine scanning mutagenesis of residues 1394-1404 in the context of the catalytic domain of MEKK1 (MEKK1Δ) (Fig. 1B). In addition, we included in these studies T1381A and T1393A mutations, because these two threonines have been reported to be autophosphorylation sites critical for MEKK1 activation (33Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

Excluded from these studies were the residues of the Ala-Pro-Glu motif (residues 1398-1400), because this motif is strongly conserved among protein kinases (35Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book, 1st Ed.2nd Vol.. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar).We first examined the effects of the MEKK1Δ mutations on the activation of AP1 and NF-κB reporter genes. HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for wild type or mutant MEKK1Δ and either AP1 or NF-κB luciferase reporter genes, and subsequently the luciferase activities were measured. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, overexpression of wild type MEKK1Δ induced robust activation of both AP1 and NF-κB reporter genes (compare columns 1 and 2). The phospho-acceptor mutants T1381A and T1393A both failed to induce activity from either (columns 3 and 4), consistent with previous studies on these residues (33Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

Most mutations, including the F1396A, M1397A, V1401A, and G1404A mutations, substantially diminished or abolished both AP1 and NF-κB reporter gene activity (Fig. 2, A and B, columns 6-8 and 11). An exception to this was the R1403A mutation, which diminished AP1 reporter gene activity without diminishing the NF-κB reporter gene activity (Fig. 2, A and B, column 10).Fig. 2Reporter gene assays with MEKK1Δ mutants. HeLa cells grown in 24-well plates were cotransfected with wild type or mutant MEKK1Δ expression constructs or pcDNA3, as indicated, 0.2 μg of pAP1-Luc or pNF-κB-Luc, and 0.05 μg of pRL-TK. Luciferase activities were measured and normalized to that of the renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) internal transfection control.

This mutant was actually more active (172%) than wild type MEKK1Δ in activating the NF-κB reporter gene, but was deficient in inducing AP1 activity (39% of wild type; Fig. 2, A and B, column 9). In contrast, the I1394A mutant induced substantial AP1 reporter gene activity (64% of wild type), but almost completely lacked NF-κB-inducing activity (Fig. 2, A and B, column 5). Titration experiments with these two mutants confirmed that the I1394A mutant is more selectively active toward the AP1 reporter gene than the NF-κB reporter gene, whereas the L1402A displays the opposite preference (Fig. 2, C and D).Mutations in Subdomain VIII of MEKK1Δ Impair Its Activation of MAP2Ks and IKK—The principal substrate of MEKK1 is MKK4, so we examined the effects of these mutations on MKK4 phosphorylation and activity. Because MEKK1Δ can also activate MKK7 and MEK1 (13Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we examined activation of these MAP2Ks as well. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for wild type or mutant MEKK1Δ, and ones for epitope-tagged MKK4, MKK7, or MEK1. The MAP2K was subsequently immunoprecipitated, and its capacity to phosphorylate recombinant MAPKs (GSTJNK1 (K55R) in the case of MKK4 and MKK7, His6-ERK2 in the case of MEK1) then measured in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. We also performed parallel assays in which endogenous IKK was immunoprecipitated and then assayed for phosphorylation of GST-IκBα(5-55). Endogenous, as opposed to overexpressed, IKK was examined in these experiments due to high basal activity of overexpressed IKK (data not shown) (36Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar).Wild type MEKK1Δ, as expected, induced easily detectable MAP2K or IKK activity (Fig. 3, A-D, upper panels, lane 2), whereas the phospho-acceptor mutants T1381A and T1393A were deficient in this regard (Fig. 3, A-D, upper panels, lanes 3 and 4). An additional experiment examining the capacity of MEKK1Δ to phosphorylate Thr-261 in the activation loop of MKK4 demonstrates a close correlation between this activity and the ability of MEKK1Δ to induce MKK4 activity (compare Fig. 3, E and A). With many mutations, the results with all assays were similar. Thus, and consistent with the AP1 and NF-κB reporter gene assays, the F1396A, M1397A, and V1401A mutants showed diminished MKK4 activation (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 6-8), with similar results observed with MKK7, MEK1, and IKK activation (Fig. 3, C, D, and B, respectively, upper panels, lanes 6-8).Fig. 3Immunocomplex kinase assays with MEKK1Δ mutants. COS-1 cells grown in 6-well plates were cotransfected with the indicated wild type or mutant MEKK1Δ constructs or pcDNA3, and 1 μg of either pCMV2-FLAG-MKK4 (A), pCS3MT-MKK7 (C), or pCMV-HA-MEK1 (D). FLAG-MKK4 (A), endogenous IKK (B), myc-MKK7 (C), or HA-MEK1 (D) was then immunoprecipitated and incubated in the presence of 0.5 μg of GST-JNK1 (K55R) (A and C), GST-IκBα(5-55) (B), or His6-ERK2 (D) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 1 h to assay for kinase activity (KA). Reaction products were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The relative kinase activities (Rel Act) are shown. E, 5 μl of cell lysates containing transiently expressed wild type or mutant MEKK1Δ were incubated with 0.5 μg of GST-MKK4(K131A) in presence of 100 μm ATP.

For plus-strand DNA synthesis, RNase H generates the polypurine tract (PPT) primer and cleaves the minus-strand tRNA primer. The manner in which this enzyme carries out these multiple functions is not well understood, but two modes of RNase H activity can be distinguished as follows: (i) a polymerase-dependent mode that accompanies DNA synthesis and is positioned by the polymerase active site binding to the recessed nascent DNA 3′ end and (ii) a polymerase-independent mode that occurs without DNA synthesis. Wisniewski et al. (5Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Wisniewski M.

Both modes of RNase H activity are necessary to remove the RNA after minus-strand DNA synthesis. During DNA synthesis, the RNA template is only partially digested because of a greater rate of polymerization versus RNA template cleavage (8Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol.

The fragments, which remain bound to the minus-strand DNA, must be digested further by the polymerase-independent activity of RNase H. Specific purine-rich fragments called PPTs are more resistant to RNase H digestion and function as RNA primers for plus-strand DNA synthesis (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H.

Precise cleavage of the RNA at the PPT/U3 junction by RNase H and extension of the PPT primer by the polymerase activity of RT are critical for production of integration-competent elements. We previously showed that a recombinant Ty1 RT can recapitulate in vitro key processes that control proper replication of the Ty1 element in vivo (11Wilhelm M. Uzun O. Mules E.H. Gabriel A. Wilhelm F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47695-47701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Using wild type RNA/DNA duplexes, we showed that the RNase H activity of Ty1 RT is able to digest the template RNA at the PPT/U3 border (i.e. between nt –1 and +1, see Fig. 2 for numbering) during elongation of minus-strand DNA. The polymerase-independent RNase H activity cleaves the RNA into fragments of 8–10 nt in size. In this paper, we show that the RNA can be further degraded to generate smaller cleavage products of 6 nt in length.Fig. 2Internal RNase H cleavage of the PPT primer.A, the sequence of the DNA template and three RNA primers (–9/–1, –9/+3, and –9/+7) used in B.

Cleavage of the PPT sequence between nt –1 and +1 generates the correct PPT 3′ terminus, which can be used to initiate plus-strand DNA synthesis. At some time during plus-strand DNA synthesis, the PPT primer must be precisely cleaved at the PPT/DNA junction. We demonstrate here that extension of at least 9 nt is necessary to allow cleavage of the PPT/DNA junction. This leaves a nick between the RNA primer and the nascent plus-strand DNA. Using model heteroduplexes that mimic this nicked structure, we tested whether the Ty1 enzyme is able to elongate the cleaved PPT primer in the presence of downstream DNA. Our results indicate that reinitiation at the nick is highly inefficient. This result cannot be explained by a lack of Ty1 RT strand displacement activity, because extension of the primer and displacement of the downstream DNA does take place when gaps are introduced between the PPT primer and the downstream DNA. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Ty1 RT—The wild-type Ty1 recombinant RT and the D468S RNase H active site mutant version (12Uzun O. Gabriel A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6337-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of the wild-type construct contained six histidine residues at their amino termini. They were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni2+-nitroloacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography as described previously (13Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) RNA and DNA Oligonucleotides and RNA Labeling—The RNA oligoribonucleotides were chemically synthesized in our laboratory with a DNA-RNA Applied Biosystem Synthesizer (Model 392) or purchased from Thermo Hybaid, the Interactiva Division (Ulm, Germany). The DNA oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Thermo Hybaid. The chemically synthesized RNAs were labeled at their 5′ termini with 32P using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Primer-template Annealing, RT, and RNase H Assays—To prepare the RNA/DNA duplexes, a 3–5 molar excess of template DNA was hybridized to the primer RNA in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 15 mm NaCl, and 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was heated at 90 °C for 1 min and then incubated for 10 min at 70 °C, 10 min at 42 °C, and 10 min at room temperature. After the addition of the Ty1 RT (at a 2:5 RT to primer-template molar ratio), the samples are incubated at 23 °C for the time indicated in the legends of the figures. RNase H cleavage and/or RT polymerization were initiated with MgCl2 at a final concentration of 20 mm. The reactions were stopped by the addition of formamide sample buffer containing 25 mm EDTA. The products of the reaction were separated on denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Quantification of gel bands was performed using a Fuji PhosphorImager. To prepare the internally labeled 9R/9D primer, the 9R primer was annealed to a template with a 9-nt extension. The 9R primer was extended with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of dATP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dGTP. The labeled primer was electrophoretically separated, extracted, precipitated, and resuspended to obtain a purified product. Interaction between Ty1 RT and the Plus-strand Primer/Template Initiation Complex—In Ty1, the primer for plusstrand DNA synthesis is a 9-nt oligoribonucleotide with the –9/–1 sequence uggguggua (14Heyman T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4547-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Compared with retroviral PPTs, this sequence is unusual in that it is so short (9 nt compared with 18–23 nt for retroviral PPTs) and contains three pyrimidines at positions –2, –5, and –9. To mimic the plus-strand Ty1 primer-template initiation complex, a 9-nt PPT oligoribonucleotide corresponding to the Ty1 PPT was annealed to a 35-nt DNA template containing flanking upstream sequences from the Ty1-untranslated region and downstream sequences from the Ty1 U3 region (Fig. 2A). We have previously shown that the 9-nt PPT primer is relatively resistant to RNase H cleavage when this hybrid substrate is incubated with Ty1 RT (11Wilhelm M. Uzun O. Mules E.H. Gabriel A. Wilhelm F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47695-47701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, we observed partial cleavage of the PPT primer 6 nt from the 5′ end of the primer between nt –3 and –4 (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, a –1/+1 cleavage occurs rapidly with primers containing different 3′ extensions beyond +1, whereas a second cut between –3 and –4 occurs as well. Both cuts are absent when an RNase H minus (RH–) Ty1 RT is used (Fig. 2C). Wisniewski et al. (5Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although we cannot determine from our data the positioning responsible for this cleavage event, it appears that the internal cleavage of the PPT does occur in our in vitro system. In the polymerization mode, the polymerase domain of RT binds the RNA primer at its 3′ end. Because 3′ binding means progression of replication while internal cleavage could generate incorrect termini, it was of interest to analyze the relative efficiency of these two outcomes. We annealed a 48-nt template including 14 nt from the Ty1-untranslated region and 25 nt from the Ty1 U3 downstream region to a 9R/9D chimeric primer containing the nine RNA residues of the PPT and nine DNA residues (internally labeled with radioactive dGTP at positions +2, +5, and +6 as described under “Experimental Procedures”) complementary to 9 nt of the U3 sequence. This model substrate is a probable intermediate during plus-strand DNA replication. The primer-template was incubated with either wild type or RNase H– Ty1 RT in the presence of all four dNTPs (Fig. 3). With the RNase H– enzyme, the major elongation product was a 9R/25D band corresponding to the run-off species (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). This product is not prominent, in line with previous data from our laboratories and others (for example, see Ref. 17Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28169-28176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that RNA primers are not used efficiently in vitro. The pattern obtained with the wild type enzyme, which has both RNase H and polymerase activity, is more complex because elongation is superimposed upon primer removal and internal primer cleavage. In this case, no 9R/25D run-off band was observed (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2), indicating the marked propensity of cleavage of the primer RNA by RNase H. Instead, a 25D band is present corresponding to the run-off product with the primer removed. Two stronger low molecular weight bands (9D and 3R/9D) were also observed. These bands probably result from the polymerase-independent activity of Ty1 RT, which cleaves the chimeric 9R/9D primer at the PPT/U3 junction (9D band) and within the RNA moiety of the chimeric 9R/9D primer (3R/9D band). The 9D band could also be generated during elongation of plus-strand DNA by the polymerase-dependent RNase H activity. Thus, there are multiple outcomes depending on the nature of the binding of RT to its substrate. The enzyme, which binds to the 3′ end of the primer, is able to initiate plus-strand synthesis. With the wild type enzyme, the elongated product is rapidly cleaved at the DNA/RNA interface (i.e. the PPT/U3 junction). A large proportion of the enzyme, however, prefers to cleave the RNA within the PPT sequence. In the case of Fig. 3, it appears that only <8% of the product is elongated, whereas ∼87% is cleaved. If this were to occur in vivo, it would limit the production of plus-strand strong-stop DNA. Processing of the Initially Synthesized Plus-strand DNA— Once the PPT is used as a primer, under what circumstances is it removed from the 5′ end of the nascent plus-strand? To follow the processing of the initially synthesized plus-strand DNA, a –9/–1 PPT primer was annealed to different length templates ranging from P/T7 to P/T16 (Fig. 4A) so that elongation products containing 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 16 oligodeoxynucleotides could be obtained after incubation of the primer-template with RT and dNTPs. The primer was not labeled but [α-32P]dGTP was included in the reaction mixture. This allowed visualization of the elongated primer and of the newly synthesized DNA released after cleavage by RNase H (Fig. 4B). Run-off bands of the expected length were obtained for all of the primer-templates used as well as bands with n + 1 residues added to the primer, attributable to the non-templated base addition by the terminal transferase activity of Ty1 RT (18Boutabout M. Wilhelm M. Wilhelm F.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Bands containing n and n + 1 deoxyribonucleotides seen in Fig. 4B, lanes 2–6, correspond to cleaved newly synthesized DNA. Alternatively, these bands could correspond to the stoppage of extension, so we carried out a parallel experiment using an RNase H– RT. No bands containing n or n + 1 deoxynucleotides were observed with the RNase H– RT, confirming the identity of the cleaved band (for example, see Fig. 6 where no 16D band is observed in lane 2 when the primer is elongated by the RNase H– enzyme).Fig. 6Cleavage of the RNA/DNA junction by a RT molecule that is not involved in DNA synthesis.A, sequence of the expected synthesis products of the primer-template used in C.

As in Fig. 3, the primer was not labeled but the reaction mixture contained [α-32P]dGTP so that the newly synthesized DNA was internally labeled. C, lane RH+, the PPT primer annealed to the DNA template was elongated with the wild type enzyme. A 9R/16D run-off product and a cleaved 16D product are observed. Lane RH–, the primer-template was incubated with RNase H– RT, only the 9R/16D run-off product is observed. Lane RH–/RH+, an aliquot of the reaction product shown in lane RH– was removed and mixed with wild type enzyme. The RT-associated RNase H activity of the wild type enzyme cleaves the RNA primer from newly synthesized DNA. 70% of the run-off 9R/16D band is cleaved, giving rise to the 16D band. Lane M is a 32P-end-labeled 16D control oligonucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The length of the cleaved band indicates that cleavage by RNase H is precise and occurs exactly at the RNA/DNA junction. Cleaved products were observed with primer-templates P/T9 to P/T16 but not with P/T7, which allows the addition of 7 nt to the primer. This finding suggests that the RNA primer is efficiently cleaved from the growing plus-strand DNA only after 9 or more nucleotides have been added to the primer. To confirm that the n + 1 bands represents non-templated base addition, we carried out extension with P/T16 in the presence or absence of dideoxynucleotides (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7). In one reaction (lane 6), the four dNTPs were included in the nucleotide mixture, whereas in the second reaction (lane 7), ddCTP was included along with dATP, dTTP, and dGTP. A comparison of these two lanes shows that the run-off bands with n + 1 residues added to the primer and the cleaved fragment of DNA containing n + 1 residues were not observed in lane 7 because the last residue of the newly synthesized DNA is a dideoxynucleotide, which cannot be elongated by terminal transferase. To confirm that cleavage does not occur after 7 nt have been added to the PPT primer, we compared elongation and cleavage on two primer-templates, P/T7 and P/T16, using wild type and RNase H– Ty1 RT (Fig. 5). In these experiments, the primer RNA is 5′ end-labeled. With P/T7, extended product accumulates with time and the pattern of elongation is the same regardless of the presence or absence of RNase H activity. For P/T16, the accumulation of product with time is observed in the absence of RNase H. In its presence, only a low and constant level of product is observed, consistent with an equilibrium between extension and cleavage of the labeled primer. These results demonstrate that RNase H does not cleave a PPT substrate extended by only 7 bases. It also suggests that the wild type enzyme remains bound to the 3′ end of the elongated primer, blocking the cleavage site. Otherwise another molecule of RT could bind to the 5′ end of the primer and cleave at the PPT/U3 junction. Separate studies of Ty1 RT turnover after extending a model substrate indicate a marked propensity of this enzyme to remain bound to its extended substrate. 2M. Pandey and A. Gabriel, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, when 9–16 nt are extended, cleavage between nt –1 and +1 is efficient and full-length RNA/DNA hybrid does not continue to accumulate over time. This is consistent with elimination of a steric hindrance on the cleavage site. We know from our previous work (11Wilhelm M. Uzun O. Mules E.H. Gabriel A. Wilhelm F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47695-47701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that the polymerase-dependent cleavage remains at a fixed distance of 14 nt from the 3′ end of the elongated molecule. The observation that the PPT/U3 junction is already cleaved after 9 nucleotides have been added to the primer (Fig. 4) suggests that this cleavage could be accomplished by a second RT molecule not directly involved in DNA synthesis. Alternatively, the distance between the polymerase and RNase H active sites may be more dynamic in the case of the PPT sequence, allowing RNase H cleavage after only the addition of 9 nt. To test whether a second RT not involved in elongation could cleave the partially extended primer, we elongated the –9/–1 primer on template T16 using the RNase H– enzyme (Fig. 6, lane 2). An aliquot of the reaction product was then mixed with wild type enzyme. Both samples were then separated on a sequencing gel. As shown in Fig. 6, lane 3, after the addition of the wild type enzyme, 70% of the product synthesized by the RNase H– enzyme is cleaved by the RT-associated RNase H activity of the wild type enzyme. These data show that cleavage can indeed be accomplished by a RT molecule that is not involved in DNA synthesis and are consistent with results obtained with HIV-1 RT (19Götte M. Maier G. Onori A.M.

This finding suggests a model in which a second RT molecule binds to the 5′ end of the extended primer and is possibly recruited to that location to remove the RNA primer when the growing strand of the newly synthesized DNA has been sufficiently extended. Although we do not know that a second RT molecule is involved in the in vivo cleavage of Ty1 replication intermediates within virus-like particles, 15–30 RT molecules are probably present within a virus-like particles and could take part in such reaction (20Burns N.R.

Extension of the Cleaved PPT Primer at a Nick—We have observed that initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis is rapidly followed by the cleavage of the PPT primer between nt –1 and nt +1. This results in a nick between the primer and the nascent plus-strand DNA. We next asked whether this cleaved RNA could be re-utilized as a primer for a second round of plus-strand synthesis in the presence of downstream DNA. A model heteroduplex was generated in which a template DNA was annealed to the –9/–1 RNA primer with or without +1/+32 downstream DNA (Fig. 7A). These substrates were incubated with Ty1 RT in a reaction mixture containing [α-32P]dGTP. In the absence of downstream DNA, the primer is readily elongated (Fig. 7B, lanes 4–6, large black and white arrow). In contrast, the primer is very poorly extended in the presence of downstream DNA (Fig. 7B, lanes 1–3). The band indicated by a small arrow is a 32-nt downstream DNA that has been elongated by one radioactive dGTP by the terminal transferase activity of Ty1 RT. A lack of strand displacement activity of Ty1 RT cannot explain our observed result since extension and strand displacement do take place when gaps of 4 or 8 nt are introduced between the primer and the downstream DNA (Fig. 7C, lanes 2 and 3, large black and white arrow). Thus, it appears that the Ty1 RT requires a recessed primer end or at least a gap beyond the primer end to initiate polymerization. Strand displacement activity of Ty1 RT was confirmed using a primer-template with a 28-nt gap between the primer and the downstream DNA. In this experiment, a 5′ end-labeled DNA primer was annealed to the template DNA with or without excess downstream DNA. We verified that all of the template was bound to downstream DNA (data not shown). Polymerization was followed as a function of time (Fig. 8B). An examination of the time course reveals that in the presence of downstream DNA (Fig. 8B, lanes 5–7), a pause in elongation of the primer is observed at the position where RT encounters the downstream DNA. Once the downstream DNA has been displaced, a run-off band of the expected size is produced. This indicates that strand displacement can be efficient and occurs when RT is actively synthesizing a new strand of DNA. One important function of the RNase H activity associated with retroviral or long terminal repeat retrotransposon reverse transcriptases is to create the PPT primers for plus-strand DNA synthesis. Using RNA/DNA duplexes containing the PPT, we previously showed that a recombinant Ty1 RT is able to make specific internal cleavages that could generate the plusstrand primer with correct 5′ and 3′ ends. The PPT is relatively resistant to RNase H cleavage in vitro, but we show here that it can be cleaved internally by the polymerase-independent RNase H activity of Ty1 RT. Similar in vitro cleavages have been observed with HIV-1 (5Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.
