https://openalex.org/W4304698823,"Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are predicted to collectively explain 40-50% of phenotypic variation in human height, but identifying the specific variants and associated regions requires huge sample sizes1. Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90 kb, covering about 21% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel2) account for 40% (45%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10-20% (14-24%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries."

https://openalex.org/W4304698321,"The water-splitting reaction using photocatalyst particles is a promising route for solar fuel production1-4. Photo-induced charge transfer from a photocatalyst to catalytic surface sites is key in ensuring photocatalytic efficiency5; however, it is challenging to understand this process, which spans a wide spatiotemporal range from nanometres to micrometres and from femtoseconds to seconds6-8. Although the steady-state charge distribution on single photocatalyst particles has been mapped by microscopic techniques9-11, and the charge transfer dynamics in photocatalyst aggregations have been revealed by time-resolved spectroscopy12,13, spatiotemporally evolving charge transfer processes in single photocatalyst particles cannot be tracked, and their exact mechanism is unknown. Here we perform spatiotemporally resolved surface photovoltage measurements on cuprous oxide photocatalyst particles to map holistic charge transfer processes on the femtosecond to second timescale at the single-particle level. We find that photogenerated electrons are transferred to the catalytic surface quasi-ballistically through inter-facet hot electron transfer on a subpicosecond timescale, whereas photogenerated holes are transferred to a spatially separated surface and stabilized through selective trapping on a microsecond timescale. We demonstrate that these ultrafast-hot-electron-transfer and anisotropic-trapping regimes, which challenge the classical perception of a drift-diffusion model, contribute to the efficient charge separation in photocatalysis and improve photocatalytic performance. We anticipate that our findings will be used to illustrate the universality of other photoelectronic devices and facilitate the rational design of photocatalysts."
https://openalex.org/W4304698283,"Self-organizing neural organoids represent a promising in vitro platform with which to model human development and disease1-5. However, organoids lack the connectivity that exists in vivo, which limits maturation and makes integration with other circuits that control behaviour impossible. Here we show that human stem cell-derived cortical organoids transplanted into the somatosensory cortex of newborn athymic rats develop mature cell types that integrate into sensory and motivation-related circuits. MRI reveals post-transplantation organoid growth across multiple stem cell lines and animals, whereas single-nucleus profiling shows progression of corticogenesis and the emergence of activity-dependent transcriptional programs. Indeed, transplanted cortical neurons display more complex morphological, synaptic and intrinsic membrane properties than their in vitro counterparts, which enables the discovery of defects in neurons derived from individuals with Timothy syndrome. Anatomical and functional tracings show that transplanted organoids receive thalamocortical and corticocortical inputs, and in vivo recordings of neural activity demonstrate that these inputs can produce sensory responses in human cells. Finally, cortical organoids extend axons throughout the rat brain and their optogenetic activation can drive reward-seeking behaviour. Thus, transplanted human cortical neurons mature and engage host circuits that control behaviour. We anticipate that this approach will be useful for detecting circuit-level phenotypes in patient-derived cells that cannot otherwise be uncovered."
https://openalex.org/W4304780007,"As the United Nations develops a post-2020 global biodiversity framework for the Convention on Biological Diversity, attention is focusing on how new goals and targets for ecosystem conservation might serve its vision of 'living in harmony with nature'1,2. Advancing dual imperatives to conserve biodiversity and sustain ecosystem services requires reliable and resilient generalizations and predictions about ecosystem responses to environmental change and management3. Ecosystems vary in their biota4, service provision5 and relative exposure to risks6, yet there is no globally consistent classification of ecosystems that reflects functional responses to change and management. This hampers progress on developing conservation targets and sustainability goals. Here we present the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Ecosystem Typology, a conceptually robust, scalable, spatially explicit approach for generalizations and predictions about functions, biota, risks and management remedies across the entire biosphere. The outcome of a major cross-disciplinary collaboration, this novel framework places all of Earth's ecosystems into a unifying theoretical context to guide the transformation of ecosystem policy and management from global to local scales. This new information infrastructure will support knowledge transfer for ecosystem-specific management and restoration, globally standardized ecosystem risk assessments, natural capital accounting and progress on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework."
https://openalex.org/W4304777328,"Abstract Personalized exoskeleton assistance provides users with the largest improvements in walking speed 1 and energy economy 2–4 but requires lengthy tests under unnatural laboratory conditions. Here we show that exoskeleton optimization can be performed rapidly and under real-world conditions. We designed a portable ankle exoskeleton based on insights from tests with a versatile laboratory testbed. We developed a data-driven method for optimizing exoskeleton assistance outdoors using wearable sensors and found that it was equally effective as laboratory methods, but identified optimal parameters four times faster. We performed real-world optimization using data collected during many short bouts of walking at varying speeds. Assistance optimized during one hour of naturalistic walking in a public setting increased self-selected speed by 9 ± 4% and reduced the energy used to travel a given distance by 17 ± 5% compared with normal shoes. This assistance reduced metabolic energy consumption by 23 ± 8% when participants walked on a treadmill at a standard speed of 1.5 m s −1 . Human movements encode information that can be used to personalize assistive devices and enhance performance."

https://openalex.org/W4304780947,"Abstract When electric conductors differ from their mirror image, unusual chiral transport coefficients appear that are forbidden in achiral metals, such as a non-linear electric response known as electronic magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) 1–6 . Although chiral transport signatures are allowed by symmetry in many conductors without a centre of inversion, they reach appreciable levels only in rare cases in which an exceptionally strong chiral coupling to the itinerant electrons is present. So far, observations of chiral transport have been limited to materials in which the atomic positions strongly break mirror symmetries. Here, we report chiral transport in the centrosymmetric layered kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 observed via second-harmonic generation under an in-plane magnetic field. The eMChA signal becomes significant only at temperatures below $${T}^{{\prime} }\approx $$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:mrow> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>T</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>′</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> <mml:mo>≈</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> 35 K, deep within the charge-ordered state of CsV 3 Sb 5 ( T CDW ≈ 94 K). This temperature dependence reveals a direct correspondence between electronic chirality, unidirectional charge order 7 and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking due to putative orbital loop currents 8–10 . We show that the chirality is set by the out-of-plane field component and that a transition from left- to right-handed transport can be induced by changing the field sign. CsV 3 Sb 5 is the first material in which strong chiral transport can be controlled and switched by small magnetic field changes, in stark contrast to structurally chiral materials, which is a prerequisite for applications in chiral electronics."
https://openalex.org/W4304780387,"Although the generation of movements is a fundamental function of the nervous system, the underlying neural principles remain unclear. As flexor and extensor muscle activities alternate during rhythmic movements such as walking, it is often assumed that the responsible neural circuitry is similarly exhibiting alternating activity1. Here we present ensemble recordings of neurons in the lumbar spinal cord that indicate that, rather than alternating, the population is performing a low-dimensional 'rotation' in neural space, in which the neural activity is cycling through all phases continuously during the rhythmic behaviour. The radius of rotation correlates with the intended muscle force, and a perturbation of the low-dimensional trajectory can modify the motor behaviour. As existing models of spinal motor control do not offer an adequate explanation of rotation1,2, we propose a theory of neural generation of movements from which this and other unresolved issues, such as speed regulation, force control and multifunctionalism, are readily explained."
https://openalex.org/W4304698329,"Soils are the foundation of all terrestrial ecosystems1. However, unlike for plants and animals, a global assessment of hotspots for soil nature conservation is still lacking2. This hampers our ability to establish nature conservation priorities for the multiple dimensions that support the soil system: from soil biodiversity to ecosystem services. Here, to identify global hotspots for soil nature conservation, we performed a global field survey that includes observations of biodiversity (archaea, bacteria, fungi, protists and invertebrates) and functions (critical for six ecosystem services) in 615 composite samples of topsoil from a standardized survey in all continents. We found that each of the different ecological dimensions of soils-that is, species richness (alpha diversity, measured as amplicon sequence variants), community dissimilarity and ecosystem services-peaked in contrasting regions of the planet, and were associated with different environmental factors. Temperate ecosystems showed the highest species richness, whereas community dissimilarity peaked in the tropics, and colder high-latitudinal ecosystems were identified as hotspots of ecosystem services. These findings highlight the complexities that are involved in simultaneously protecting multiple ecological dimensions of soil. We further show that most of these hotspots are not adequately covered by protected areas (more than 70%), and are vulnerable in the context of several scenarios of global change. Our global estimation of priorities for soil nature conservation highlights the importance of accounting for the multidimensionality of soil biodiversity and ecosystem services to conserve soils for future generations."
https://openalex.org/W4304698325,"Delocalized Bloch electrons and the low-energy correlations between them determine key optical1, electronic2 and entanglement3 functionalities of solids, all the way through to phase transitions4,5. To directly capture how many-body correlations affect the actual motion of Bloch electrons, subfemtosecond (1 fs = 10-15 s) temporal precision6-15 is desirable. Yet, probing with attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s) high-energy photons has not been energy-selective enough to resolve the relevant millielectronvolt-scale interactions of electrons1-5,16,17 near the Fermi energy. Here, we use multi-terahertz light fields to force electron-hole pairs in crystalline semiconductors onto closed trajectories, and clock the delay between separation and recollision with 300 as precision, corresponding to 0.7% of the driving field's oscillation period. We detect that strong Coulomb correlations emergent in atomically thin WSe2 shift the optimal timing of recollisions by up to 1.2 ± 0.3 fs compared to the bulk material. A quantitative analysis with quantum-dynamic many-body computations in a Wigner-function representation yields a direct and intuitive view on how the Coulomb interaction, non-classical aspects, the strength of the driving field and the valley polarization influence the dynamics. The resulting attosecond chronoscopy of delocalized electrons could revolutionize the understanding of unexpected phase transitions and emergent quantum-dynamic phenomena for future electronic, optoelectronic and quantum-information technologies."
https://openalex.org/W4304778071,"The afterglow of the binary neutron-star merger GW1708171 gave evidence for a structured relativistic jet2-6 and a link3,7,8 between such mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Superluminal motion, found using radio very long baseline interferometry3 (VLBI), together with the afterglow light curve provided constraints on the viewing angle (14-28 degrees), the opening angle of the jet core (less than 5 degrees) and a modest limit on the initial Lorentz factor of the jet core (more than 4). Here we report on another superluminal motion measurement, at seven times the speed of light, leveraging Hubble Space Telescope precision astrometry and previous radio VLBI data for GW170817. We thereby obtain a measurement of the Lorentz factor of the wing of the structured jet, as well as substantially improved constraints on the viewing angle (19-25 degrees) and the initial Lorentz factor of the jet core (more than 40)."
https://openalex.org/W4304698217,"The general-relativistic phenomenon of spin-induced orbital precession has not yet been observed in strong-field gravity. Gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes (BBHs) are prime candidates, as we expect the astrophysical binary population to contain precessing binaries1,2. Imprints of precession have been investigated in several signals3-5, but no definitive identification of orbital precession has been reported in any of the 84 BBH observations so far5-7 by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors8,9. Here we report the measurement of strong-field precession in the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra gravitational-wave signal GW200129. The binary's orbit precesses at a rate ten orders of magnitude faster than previous weak-field measurements from binary pulsars10-13. We also find that the primary black hole is probably highly spinning. According to current binary population estimates, a GW200129-like signal is extremely unlikely, and therefore presents a direct challenge to many current binary-formation models."

https://openalex.org/W4304756623,"Abstract RNA-guided systems, such as CRISPR–Cas, combine programmable substrate recognition with enzymatic function, a combination that has been used advantageously to develop powerful molecular technologies 1,2 . Structural studies of these systems have illuminated how the RNA and protein jointly recognize and cleave their substrates, guiding rational engineering for further technology development 3 . Recent work identified a new class of RNA-guided systems, termed OMEGA, which include IscB, the likely ancestor of Cas9, and the nickase IsrB, a homologue of IscB lacking the HNH nuclease domain 4 . IsrB consists of only around 350 amino acids, but its small size is counterbalanced by a relatively large RNA guide (roughly 300-nt ωRNA). Here, we report the cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of Desulfovirgula thermocuniculi IsrB (DtIsrB) in complex with its cognate ωRNA and a target DNA. We find the overall structure of the IsrB protein shares a common scaffold with Cas9. In contrast to Cas9, however, which uses a recognition (REC) lobe to facilitate target selection, IsrB relies on its ωRNA, part of which forms an intricate ternary structure positioned analogously to REC. Structural analyses of IsrB and its ωRNA as well as comparisons to other RNA-guided systems highlight the functional interplay between protein and RNA, advancing our understanding of the biology and evolution of these diverse systems."
https://openalex.org/W4304779580,"Around birth, globin expression in human red blood cells (RBCs) shifts from γ-globin to β-globin, which results in fetal haemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) being gradually replaced by adult haemoglobin (HbA, α2β2)1. This process has motivated the development of innovative approaches to treat sickle cell disease and β-thalassaemia by increasing HbF levels in postnatal RBCs2. Here we provide therapeutically relevant insights into globin gene switching obtained through a CRISPR-Cas9 screen for ubiquitin-proteasome components that regulate HbF expression. In RBC precursors, depletion of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase stabilized its ubiquitination target, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)3,4, to induce γ-globin gene transcription. Mechanistically, HIF1α-HIF1β heterodimers bound cognate DNA elements in BGLT3, a long noncoding RNA gene located 2.7 kb downstream of the tandem γ-globin genes HBG1 and HBG2. This was followed by the recruitment of transcriptional activators, chromatin opening and increased long-range interactions between the γ-globin genes and their upstream enhancer. Similar induction of HbF occurred with hypoxia or with inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes that target HIF1α for ubiquitination by the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our findings link globin gene regulation with canonical hypoxia adaptation, provide a mechanism for HbF induction during stress erythropoiesis and suggest a new therapeutic approach for β-haemoglobinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4305042398,"Plants have evolved heavy metal tolerance mechanisms to adapt and cope with nickel (Ni) toxicity. Decrypting whole gene expression of Trembling Aspen ( Pinus tremuloides ) under nickel stress could elucidate the nickel resistance/tolerance mechanisms. The main objectives of the present research were to 1) characterize the P . tremuloides transcriptome, and 2) compare gene expression dynamics between nickel-resistant and nickel-susceptible P . tremuloides genotypes with Whole Transcriptome (WT) sequencing. Illumina Sequencing generated 27–45 million 2X150 paired-end reads of raw data per sample. The alignment performed with StringTie Software added two groups of transcripts to the draft genome annotation. One group contained 32,677 new isoforms that match to 17,254 genes. The second group contained 17,349 novel transcripts that represent 16,157 novel genes. Overall, 52,987 genes were identified from which 36,770 genes were selected as differently expressed. With the high stringency (two-fold change, FDR value ≤ 0.05 and logFC value ≥1 (upregulated) or ≤ -1 (downregulated), after GSEA analysis and filtering for gene set size, 575 gene sets were upregulated and 146 were downregulated in nickel resistant phenotypes compared to susceptible genotypes. For biological process, genes associated with translation were significantly upregulated while signal transduction and cellular protein process genes were downregulated in resistant compared to susceptible genotypes. For molecular function, there was a significant downregulation of genes associated with DNA binding in resistant compared to susceptible lines. Significant upregulation was observed in genes located in ribosome while downregulation of genes in chloroplast and mitochondrion were preponderant in resistant genotypes compared to susceptible. Hence, from a whole transcriptome level, an upregulation in ribosomal and translation activities was identified as the main response to Ni toxicity in the resistant plants. More importantly, this study revealed that a metal transport protein (Potrs038704g29436 –ATOX1-related copper transport) was among the top upregulated genes in resistant genotypes when compared to susceptible plants. Other identified upregulated genes associated with abiotic stress include genes coding for Dirigent Protein 10, GATA transcription factor, Zinc finger protein, Auxin response factor, Bidirectional sugar transporter, and thiamine thiazole synthase."
https://openalex.org/W4304779343,"The Wolf-Rayet (WR) binary system WR140 is a close (0.9-16.7 mas) binary star consisting of an O5 primary and WC7 companion and is known as the archetype of episodic dust-producing WRs. Dust in WR binaries is known to form in a confined stream originating from the collision of the two stellar winds, with orbital motion of the binary sculpting the large-scale dust structure into arcs as dust is swept radially outwards. It is understood that sensitive conditions required for dust production in WR140 are only met around periastron when the two stars are sufficiently close. Here we present multiepoch imagery of the circumstellar dust shell of WR140. We constructed geometric models that closely trace the expansion of the intricately structured dust plume, showing that complex effects induced by orbital modulation may result in a 'Goldilocks zone' for dust production. We find that the expansion of the dust plume cannot be reproduced under the assumption of a simple uniform-speed outflow, finding instead the dust to be accelerating. This constitutes a direct kinematic record of dust motion under acceleration by radiation pressure and further highlights the complexity of the physical conditions in colliding-wind binaries."

https://openalex.org/W4305056988,"Hypertension is a serious public health issue in Ethiopia, but there is a paucity of evidence in the country's rural areas. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hypertension and its risk factors among adults in rural districts in northwest Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June to October 2020. The 1177 study participants were chosen using a multistage sampling procedure. A face-to-face interview was conducted using an adapted version of the WHO STEPwise approach questionnaire. Blood pressure was measured three times using an aneroid sphygmomanometer, and the mean of the last two readings were used for the analysis. Data was entered using Epidata and analyzed using STATA-16. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with hypertension.Of the total participants, 218 (18.5%) were found to be hypertensive. The prevalence of hypertension consistently increases with age. Hypertension was positively and significantly associated with female sex ((adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.45)), age group 45-54 years (AOR = 4.63, 95% CI: 1.01, 21.37), 55-64 years (AOR = 14.40, 95% CI: 3.07, 67.63), ≥65 years (AOR = 19.37, 95% CI: 4.03, 93.09), having history of alcohol consumption (AOR = 3.25, 95% CI: 1.17, 9.02), used much amount of salt (AOR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.60) and too much amount of salt (AOR = 3.78, 95% CI: 1.85, 7.72), sleeping for a short duration (AOR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.30, 3.24), and having family history of hypertension (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI; 1.32, 3.39).Hypertension was significantly high among the rural population we studied and is emerging as a public health problem. Female sex, advanced age, ever used alcohol, excessive salt intake, insufficient sleep, and a family history of hypertension were factors that were positively and significantly associated with hypertension. We recommend local health authorities integrate promotion of hypertension health education, lifestyle modification intervention on salt and alcohol reduction, and hypertension detection, particularly for the female and elderly population, at the health post level to avert the problem."
https://openalex.org/W4305056995,"The visual cycle refers to a series of biochemical reactions of retinoids in ocular tissues and supports the vision in vertebrates. The visual cycle regenerates visual pigments chromophore, 11- cis -retinal, and eliminates its toxic byproducts from the retina, supporting visual function and retinal neuron survival. Unfortunately, during the visual cycle, when 11- cis -retinal is being regenerated in the retina, toxic byproducts, such as all- trans -retinal and bis-retinoid is N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), are produced, which are proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of the dry form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The primary biochemical defect in Stargardt disease (STGD1) is the accelerated synthesis of cytotoxic lipofuscin bisretinoids, such as A2E, in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) due to mutations in the ABCA4 gene. To prevent all- trans -retinal—and bisretinoid-mediated retinal degeneration, slowing down the retinoid flow by modulating the visual cycle with a small molecule has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy. The present study describes RPE65-61, a novel, non-retinoid compound, as an inhibitor of RPE65 (a key enzyme in the visual cycle), intended to modulate the excessive activity of the visual cycle to protect the retina from harm degenerative diseases. Our data demonstrated that (±)- RPE65-61 selectively inhibited retinoid isomerase activity of RPE65, with an IC 50 of 80 nM. Furthermore, (±)- RPE65-61 inhibited RPE65 via an uncompetitive mechanism. Systemic administration of (±)- RPE65-61 in mice resulted in slower chromophore regeneration after light bleach, confirming in vivo target engagement and visual cycle modulation. Concomitant protection of the mouse retina from high-intensity light damage was also observed. Furthermore, RPE65-61 down-regulated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, decreased the inflammatory factor, and attenuated retinal apoptosis caused by light-induced retinal damage (LIRD), which led to the preservation of the retinal function. Taken together, (±)- RPE65-61 is a potent visual cycle modulator that may provide a neuroprotective therapeutic benefit for patients with STGD and AMD."

Disclosure of sero-status, poor adherence, having OIs and use of CPT prophylaxis were associated with virological failure. Therefore, a due attention needs to be given to these factors in order to minimize virological failure in patients on ART."
https://openalex.org/W4305057572,"Neuromotor pathologies often cause motor deficits and deviations from typical locomotion, reducing the quality of life. Clinical gait analysis is used to effectively classify these motor deficits to gain deeper insights into resulting walking behaviours. To allow the ensemble averaging of spatio-temporal metrics across individuals during walking, gait events, such as initial contact (IC) or toe-off (TO), are extracted through either manual annotation based on video data, or through force thresholds using force plates. This study developed a deep-learning long short-term memory (LSTM) approach to detect IC and TO automatically based on foot-marker kinematics of 363 cerebral palsy subjects (age: 11.8 ± 3.2). These foot-marker kinematics, including 3D positions and velocities of the markers located on the hallux (HLX), calcaneus (HEE), distal second metatarsal (TOE), and proximal fifth metatarsal (PMT5), were extracted retrospectively from standard barefoot gait analysis sessions. Different input combinations of these four foot-markers were evaluated across three gait subgroups (IC with the heel, midfoot, or forefoot). For the overall group, our approach detected 89.7% of ICs within 16ms of the true event with a 18.5% false alarm rate. For TOs, only 71.6% of events were detected with a 33.8% false alarm rate. While the TOE|HEE marker combination performed well across all subgroups for IC detection, optimal performance for TO detection required different input markers per subgroup with performance differences of 5-10%. Thus, deep-learning LSTM based detection of IC events using the TOE|HEE markers offers an automated alternative to avoid operator-dependent and laborious manual annotation, as well as the limited step coverage and inability to measure assisted walking for force plate-based detection of IC events."

However, the influence of resveratrol on liver function and hepatic microcirculation after hemorrhagic shock is unknown, and a presumed mediation via estrogen receptors has not been investigated in this context.Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300g, n = 14/group) underwent hemorrhagic shock for 90 min (MAP 35±5 mmHg) and were resuscitated with shed blood and Ringer's solution. Animals were treated intravenously with vehicle (1% EtOH), resveratrol (0.2 mg/kg), the unselective estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (0.05 mg/kg) or resveratrol + ICI 182,780 prior to retransfusion. Sham-operated animals did not undergo hemorrhage but were treated likewise. After 2 hours of reperfusion, liver function was assessed either by plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (PDRICG) or evaluation of hepatic perfusion and hepatic integrity by intravital microscopy, serum enzyme as well as cytokine levels.Compared to vehicle controls, administration of resveratrol significantly improved PDRICG, hepatic perfusion index and hepatic integrity after hemorrhagic shock.

NOACs and warfarin did not significantly differ with respect to stroke reduction (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.88–1.25], p = 0.19). NOAC use was associated with a lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage (HR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.44–0.83], p = 0.0019), CV death (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.43–0.70], p&lt;0.001), and all-cause death (HR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.52–0.69], p&lt;0.001) than warfarin use. Conclusion NOACs were associated with a significantly lower risk of adverse CV and renovascular outcomes than warfarin in patients with AF."
https://openalex.org/W4304698216,"Optical vortices are beams of light that carry orbital angular momentum1, which represents an extra degree of freedom that can be generated and manipulated for photonic applications2-8. Unlike vortices in other physical entities, the generation of optical vortices requires structural singularities9-12, but this affects their quasiparticle nature and hampers the possibility of altering their dynamics or making them interacting13-17. Here we report a platform that allows the spontaneous generation and active manipulation of an optical vortex-antivortex pair using an external field. An aluminium/silicon dioxide/nickel/silicon dioxide multilayer structure realizes a gradient-thickness optical cavity, where the magneto-optic effects of the nickel layer affect the transition between a trivial and a non-trivial topological phase. Rather than a structural singularity, the vortex-antivortex pairs present in the light reflected by our device are generated through mathematical singularities in the generalized parameter space of the top and bottom silicon dioxide layers, which can be mapped onto real space and exhibit polarization-dependent and topology-dependent dynamics driven by external magnetic fields. We expect that the field-induced engineering of optical vortices that we report will facilitate the study of topological photonic interactions and inspire further efforts to bestow quasiparticle-like properties to various topological photonic textures such as toroidal vortices, polarization and vortex knots, and optical skyrmions."
https://openalex.org/W4305056997,"Background Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) is strongly recommended for children following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis because of their high risk of progression to active tuberculosis, including severe disseminated disease. We describe the implementation of TPT for children and adolescents with evidence of tuberculosis infection (TBI) at Victoria’s largest children’s hospital and examine factors affecting treatment completion. Methods We conducted a retrospective clinical audit of all children and adolescents aged &lt;18 years diagnosed with latent TBI at the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, between 2010 and 2016 inclusive. The primary outcome was treatment completion, defined as completing TPT to within one month of a target duration for the specified regimen (for instance, at least five months of a six-month isoniazid course), confirmed by the treating clinician. Factors associated with treatment adherence were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results Of 402 participants with TBI, 296 (74%) met the criteria for treatment “complete”. The most common TPT regimen was six months of daily isoniazid (377, 94%). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, treatment completion was more likely among children and adolescents who had refugee health screening performed (OR 2.31, 95%CI 1.34–4.00) or who were also treated for other medical conditions (OR 1.67 95%CI 1.0–2.85), and less likely among those who experienced side-effects (OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.11–0.94). However, TPT was generally well tolerated with side-effects reported in 15 participants (3.7%). Conclusion Identification of factors associated with TPT completion and deficiencies in the existing care pathway have informed service provision changes to further improve outcomes for Victorian children and adolescents with TBI."
https://openalex.org/W4305057147,"Cochlear implant (CI) recipient's speech perception performance is highly variable and is influenced by temporal processing abilities. Temporal processing is commonly assessed using a behavioral task that requires the participant to detect a silent gap with the pre- and post-gap stimuli of the same frequency (within-frequency gap detection) or of different frequencies (across-frequency gap detection). The purpose of the study was to evaluate behavioral and electrophysiological measures of within- and across-frequency temporal processing and their correlations with speech perception performance in CI users.Participants included 11 post-lingually deafened adult CI users (n = 15 ears; Mean Age = 50.2 yrs) and 11 age- and gender-matched normal hearing (NH) individuals (n = 15 ears; Mean Age = 49.0 yrs). Speech perception was assessed with Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant Word Recognition (CNC), Arizona Biomedical Sentence Recognition (AzBio), and Bamford-Kowal-Bench Speech-in-Noise Test (BKB-SIN) tests. Within- and across-frequency behavioral gap detection thresholds (referred to as the GDTwithin and GDTacross) were measured using an adaptive, two-alternative, forced-choice procedure. Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) were elicited using within- and across-frequency gap stimuli under four gap duration conditions (no gap, GDT, sub-threshold GDT, and supra-threshold GDT). Correlations among speech perception, GDTs, and CAEPs were examined.CI users had poorer speech perception scores compared to NH listeners (p < 0.05), but the GDTs were not different between groups (p > 0.05). Compared to NH peers, CI users showed increased N1 latency in the CAEPs evoked by the across-frequency gap stimuli (p < 0.05). No group difference was observed for the CAEPs evoked by the within-frequency gap (p > 0.05). Three CI ears showing the longest GDTwithin also showed the poorest performance in speech in noise. The within-frequency CAEP increased in amplitude with the increase of gap duration; while the across-frequency CAEP displayed a similar amplitude for all gap durations. There was a significant correlation between speech scores and within-frequency CAEP measures for the supra-threshold GDT condition, with CI users with poorer speech performance having a smaller N1-P2 amplitude and longer N1 latency. No correlations were found among GDTacross, speech perception, and across-frequency CAEP measures.Within- and across-frequency gap detection may involve different neural mechanisms. The within-frequency gap detection task can help identify CI users with poor speech performance for rehabilitation. The within-frequency CAEP is a better predictor for speech perception performance than the across-frequency CAEP."
https://openalex.org/W4305057262,"The impact of antiretroviral treatment (ART) on the occurrence of oral diseases among children and adolescents living with HIV (CALHIV) is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ART timing on vitamin D levels and the prevalence of four oral diseases (dry mouth, dental caries, enamel hypoplasia, and non-herpes oral ulcer) among Kenyan CALHIV from two pediatric HIV cohorts.This nested cross-sectional study was conducted at the Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya. CALHIV, 51 with early-ART initiated at <12 months of age and 27 with late-ART initiated between 18 months-12 years of age, were included. Demographics, HIV diagnosis, baseline CD4 and HIV RNA viral load data were extracted from the primary study databases. Community Oral Health Officers performed oral health examinations following standardized training.Among 78 CALHIV in the study, median age at the time of the oral examination was 11.4 years old and median ART duration at the time of oral examination was 11 years (IQR: 10.1, 13.4). Mean serum vitamin D level was significantly higher among the early-ART group than the late-ART group (29.5 versus 22.4 ng/mL, p = 0.0002). Children who received early-ART had a 70% reduction in risk of inadequate vitamin D level (<20 ng/mL), compared to those who received late-ART (p = 0.02). Although both groups had similar prevalence of oral diseases overall (early-ART 82.4%; late-ART 85.2%; p = 0.2), there was a trend for higher prevalence of dry mouth (p = 0.1) and dental caries (p = 0.1) in the early versus late ART groups. The prevalence of the four oral diseases was not associated with vitamin D levels (p = 0.583).After >10 years of ART, CALHIV with early-ART initiation had higher serum vitamin D levels compared to the late-ART group. The four oral diseases were not significantly associated with timing of ART initiation or serum vitamin D concentrations in this cohort. There was a trend for higher prevalence of dry mouth and dental caries in the early-ART group, probably as side-effects of ART."
https://openalex.org/W4305057428,"Purpose The current study investigated the therapeutic potential of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on speech intelligibility, speech-related physiological and vocal functions among post-stroke dysarthric patients. Method Nine chronic post-stroke dysarthric patients were randomly assigned to the stimulation or sham group. The stimulation group received 2mA of anodal tDCS over the left inferior primary motor cortex for 15 minutes, while the sham group received 30s of stimulation under the same settings. All the participants received 10 daily 15 minutes of individualized speech therapy targeting their dominant phonological process or phonemes with the greatest difficulty. The outcome measures included (1) perceptual analysis of single words, passage reading and diadochokinetic rate, (2) acoustic analysis of a sustained vowel, and (3) kinematic analysis of rapid syllable repetitions and syllable production in sentence, conducted before and after the treatment. Results The results revealed that both the stimulation and sham groups had improved perceptual speech intelligibility at the word level, reduced short rushes of speech during passage reading, improved rate during alternating motion rate, AMR-k h a1, and improved articulatory kinematics in AMR-t h a1 and syllables /t h a1/ and /k h a1/ production in sentence. Compared to the sham group, the stimulation group showed significant improvement in articulatory kinematics in AMR-k h a1 and syllable /k h a1/ production in sentence. The findings also showed that anodal stimulation led to reduced shimmer value in sustained vowel /a/ phonation, positive changes in articulatory kinematics in AMR-t h a1 and syllables /p h a1/ and /k h a1/ production in sentence at the post treatment measure. In addition to positive effects on articulatory control, reduced perturbation of voice amplitude documented in the stimulation group post treatment suggests possible tDCS effects on the vocal function. Conclusions The current study documented the beneficial effects of anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex on speech production and suggested that combined tDCS and speech therapy may promote recovery from post-stroke dysarthria."
https://openalex.org/W4305057436,"The geological record of microbial metabolisms and ecologies primarily consists of stable isotope fractionations and the diagenetic products of biogenic lipids. Carotenoid lipid biomarkers are particularly useful proxies for reconstructing this record, providing information on microbial phototroph primary productivity, redox couples, and oxygenation. The biomarkers okenane, chlorobactane, and isorenieratene are generally considered to be evidence of anoxygenic phototrophs, and provide a record that extends to 1.64 Ga. The utility of the carotenoid biomarker record may be enhanced by examining the carbon isotopic ratios in these products, which are diagnostic for specific pathways of biological carbon fixation found today within different microbial groups. However, this joint inference assumes that microbes have conserved these pathways across the duration of the preserved biomarker record. Testing this hypothesis, we performed phylogenetic analyses of the enzymes constituting the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle in Chlorobiales, the group of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria usually implicated in the deposition of chlorobactane and isorenieretane. We find phylogenetically incongruent patterns of inheritance across all enzymes, indicative of horizontal gene transfers to both stem and crown Chlorobiales from multiple potential donor lineages. This indicates that a complete rTCA cycle was independently acquired at least twice within Chlorobiales and was not present in the last common ancestor. When combined with recent molecular clock analyses, these results predict that the Mesoproterzoic lipid biomarker record diagnostic for Chlorobiales should not preserve isotopic fractionations indicative of a full rTCA cycle. Furthermore, we conclude that coupling isotopic and biomarker records is insufficient for reliably reconstructing microbial paleoecologies in the absence of a complementary and consistent phylogenomic narrative."
https://openalex.org/W4305057587,"Leptospirosis is considered a neglected tropical disease despite its considerable mortality and morbidity. Lack of prediction remains a major reason for underestimating the disease. Although many models have been developed, most of them focused on the districts situated in the wet zone due to higher case numbers in that region. However, leptospirosis remains a major disease even in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The objective of this study is to develop a time series model to predict leptospirosis in the Anuradhapura district situated in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Time series data on monthly leptospirosis incidences from January 2008 to December 2018 and monthly rainfall, rainy days, temperature, and relative humidity were considered in model fitting. The first 72 months (55%) were used to fit the model, and the subsequent 60 months(45%) were used to validate the model. The log-transformed dependent variable was employed for fitting the Univariate seasonal ARIMA model. Based on the stationarity of the mean of the five variables, the ARDL model was selected as the multivariate time series technique. Residuals analysis was performed on normality, heteroskedasticity, and serial correlation to validate the model. The lowest AIC and MAPE were used to select the best model. Univariate models could not be fitted without adjusting the outliers. Adjusting seasonal outliers yielded better results than the models without adjustments. Best fitted Univariate model was ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)12,(AIC-1.08, MAPE-19.8). Best fitted ARDL model was ARDL(1, 3, 2, 1, 0),(AIC-2.04,MAPE-30.4). The number of patients reported in the previous month, rainfall, rainy days, and temperature showed a positive association, while relative humidity was negatively associated with leptospirosis. Multivariate models fitted better than univariate models for the original data. Best-fitted models indicate the necessity of including other explanatory variables such as patient, host, and epidemiological factors to yield better results."
https://openalex.org/W4305057738,"Studies have shown the indicative role of handgrip strength in health. However, there is limited evidence revealing its potential effect on death events among middle-aged and older adults in China. We aimed to prospectively evaluate if lower handgrip strength is associated with the event of death. Among 17,167 middle-aged and older adults between age 45 to 96, handgrip strength was collected by a handheld dynamometer in a Chinese longitudinal study of aging trend (CHARLS) 2011–2018. Using Cox proportional hazard models with exposures, we assessed the association between handgrip strength and death events. Elevated handgrip strength values were independently associated with the decreased death risk. These results illustrate that lower handgrip strength is an independent indicator of death risks among middle-aged and older Chinese, which highlights the significance of related intercessions. The median values of five levels of handgrip strength in the entire cohort were 16.5,23,28,33,42kg at baseline. A linear association existed between the handgrip strength values and the risk of all-cause death within 34.2kg. Handgrip strength can serve as an independent indicator for death risks."

It examines the institutional barriers and opportunities that affect women's empowerment derived from inclusion of women in the decision-making processes along the livestock vaccine value chain (LVVC) and that can support viable women-centered and owned enterprises, at the vaccine development, delivery, distribution and use level. Qualitative data analysis tools such as focus group discussions, focus meals, jar voices and key informant interviews were used. Using outcome mapping, a stakeholder analysis of the critical partners in the PPR and ND value chain was done involving the regulators, vaccine manufacturers, importers, distributors, agrovets, public and private veterinary service deliverers, local leaders, women groups, and farmers. The study concluded that training related to gender equality and livestock vaccines, infrastructural and technical support to the poultry and goat women and men farmers and other chain actors are inadequate in themselves to increase vaccine adoption and improve livestock productivity in Sembabule district. Strategies that promote gender-transformative collaborative efforts among the LVVC actors and build viable gender-transformed women groups and networks are critical to increase women's participation in and benefit from the livestock vaccine value chain."

The primary outcome was VAS scores during exercising at 6 h after surgery; secondary outcomes were pain during exercising and rest, intraoperative dose of remifentanil, cumulative dose of postoperative fentanyl, postoperative analgesia satisfaction scores, and ratio of quadriceps weakness.A total of 50 patients were randomly divided into PENG block group (n = 25) or fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) group (n = 25). Exercising VAS scores at 6 h after surgery were significantly lower in PENG block group than that in FICB group (2 (2, 4) vs. 6 (4, 7), P < 0.001). The intraoperative dose of remifentanil and cumulative dose of postoperative fentanyl by patient-controlled intravenous analgesia within 24 h after surgery in PENG block group were significantly lower than in FICB group (both P < 0.001). Postoperative analgesia satisfaction scores in PENG block group were significantly higher than those in FICB group (P = 0.016). The ratio of quadriceps weakness at 6 h after surgery was significantly higher in FICB group than PENG block group (48% vs. 0%, P < 0.001).Compared to FICB, ultrasound-guided PENG block may provide better postoperative pain relief in patients with IFF, with less pronounced quadriceps weakness."
https://openalex.org/W4305042518,"Heat accumulation has become a key factor limiting the speed and pressure of pumps. Therefore, heat transfer analysis is an important and urgent task to analyze the mechanical efficiency and cooling performance. The derivation of the correct convective heat transfer coefficient is a basic work of calculating the accurate thermal state. This paper focuses on the Taylor flow heat transfer in a two-dimensional piston pump. Firstly, the theoretical and experimental studies are carried out on its thermal model to investigate the annular convective heat transfer coefficients, from 1000 rpm to 6000 rpm. Furthermore, the data are set in the transient thermal simulation model with Ansys software and the simulation results are mutually validated with the experimental ones. The Nusselt numbers are also calculated and compared with the empirical formulas. Two new Taylor flow relations, within 15% mean deviation, are deduced. As the rotational speed and oil temperature rise, the oil cavitation becomes more severe, restricting the convective heat transfer. Therefore, the thermal analysis must adopt the experimental ones rather than the empirical ones, above 3000 rpm. Finally, a modified relation is introduced to the gas-liquid two-phase flow heat transfer of the pump transmission."

Current diagnostic methods for CCA are often expensive, time-consuming, and require medical professionals. Thus, there is a need for a simple and low-cost CCA screening method. This work developed a rapid label-free technique by Raman spectroscopy combined with the multivariate statistical methods of principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA), aiming to analyze and classify between CCA (n = 30) and healthy (n = 30) serum specimens. The model's classification performance was validated using k-fold cross validation (k = 5). Serum levels of cholesterol (548, 700 cm-1), tryptophan (878 cm-1), and amide III (1248,1265 cm-1) were found to be statistically significantly higher in the CCA patients, whereas serum beta-carotene (1158, 1524 cm-1) levels were significantly lower. The peak heights of these identified Raman marker bands were input into an LDA model, achieving a cross-validated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 71.33% and 90.00% in distinguishing the CCA from healthy specimens. The PCA-LDA technique provided a higher cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of 86.67% and 96.67%. To conclude, this work demonstrated the feasibility of using Raman spectroscopy combined with PCA-LDA as a helpful tool for cholangiocarcinoma serum-based screening."

We have conducted a comprehensive test of black fungus cultivars ""Heishan"". The mono-factor separation force experiments of black fungus and black fungus virgulate medium were conducted. It was noted that the tension angle was an important factor affecting the separation force, which was mainly distributed between 1.06 and 3.65 N. Besides, the average value of Poisson's ratio of black fungus was measured to be 0.445 in the tensile test of black fungus leaves using image recognition and analysis techniques, with a test error within 2.5%; and the average value of tensile elastic modulus and shear elastic modulus of black fungus leaves was 0.947 MPa and 0.327 MPa, respectively; we also found that the average tensile strength at the root of black fungus was not significantly different from that at the leaf, which was around 0.436 MPa.

On the one hand, this study enriches the theoretical research of technological innovation decision-making motivation; on the other hand, it provides empirical thinking for the improvement of parent-subsidiary executive collaborative governance mechanism and the improvement of governance efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4305057157,"Although perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to identify pseudoprogression, this advanced technique lacks clinical reliability. Our aim was to develop a parameter assessing the hypervascularized fraction of glioblastomas based on volume analysis of dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI and evaluate its performance in the diagnosis of pseudoprogression.Patients with primary glioblastoma showing lesion progression on the first follow-up MRI after chemoradiotherapy were enrolled retrospectively. On both initial and first follow-up MRIs, the leakage-corrected cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps were post-processed using the conventional hot-spot method and a volume method, after manual segmentation of the contrast-enhanced delineated lesion. The maximum CBV (rCBVmax) was calculated with both methods. Secondly, the threshold of 2 was applied to the CBV values contained in the entire segmented volume, defining our new parameter: %rCBV>2. The probability of pseudoprogression based on rCBVmax and %rCBV>2 was calculated in logistic regression models and diagnostic performance assessed by receiving operator characteristic curves.Out of 25 patients, 11 (44%) were classified with pseudoprogression and 14 (56%) with true progression based on the Response Assessement in Neuro-Oncology criteria. rCBVmax was lower for pseudoprogression (3.4 vs. 7.6; p = 0.033) on early follow-up MRI. %rCBV>2, was lower for pseudoprogression on both initial (57.5% vs. 71.3%; p = 0.033) and early follow-up MRIs (22.1% vs. 51.8%; p = 0.0006). On early follow-up MRI, %rCBV>2 had the largest area under the curve for the diagnosis of pseudoprogression: 0.909 [0.725-0.986].The fraction of hypervascularization of glioblastomas as assessed by %rCBV>2 was lower in tumours that subsequently developed pseudoprogression both on the initial and early follow-up MRIs. This fractional parameter may help identify pseudoprogression with greater accuracy than rCBVmax."
https://openalex.org/W4305057264,"In recent years, insect husbandry has seen an increased interest in order to supply in the production of raw materials, food, or as biological/environmental control. Unfortunately, large insect rearings are susceptible to pathogens, pests and parasitoids which can spread rapidly due to the confined nature of a rearing system. Thus, it is of interest to monitor the spread of such manifestations and the overall population size quickly and efficiently. Medical imaging techniques could be used for this purpose, as large volumes can be scanned non-invasively. Due to its 3D acquisition nature, computed tomography seems to be the most suitable for this task. This study presents an automated, computed tomography-based, counting method for bee rearings that performs comparable to identifying all Osmia cornuta cocoons manually. The proposed methodology achieves this in an average of 10 seconds per sample, compared to 90 minutes per sample for the manual count over a total of 12 samples collected around lake Zurich in 2020. Such an automated bee population evaluation tool is efficient and valuable in combating environmental influences on bee, and potentially other insect, rearings."
https://openalex.org/W4305057423,"Fossils exposed at the surface are an integral component of the paleontologic record and provide an archive of past life. However, it is widely known that fossils are not stable indefinitely upon exposure to surface conditions such as physical, chemical, and biological processes, and this last phase of taphonomy is poorly understood. Studies regarding the longevity of fossils subject to weathering, such as acidic precipitation, are absent in the literature. The goal of this study was to experimentally determine vertebrate fossil dissolution rates under variable pH conditions in a controlled laboratory setting. It was hypothesized that fossils would dissolve within acidic solutions and do so at an increasing rate when exposed to increasingly acidic solutions. The experiments were conducted on three fossil vertebrae in triplicate in closed reaction vessels at pH 4, 5, and 6. The fossils were completely submerged for 21 days in a tap water solution with the pH adjusted using 0.1N hydrochloric acid (HCl). Fossil dissolution was quantified by changes to: (1) fossil mass; (2) elemental chemistry of water and fossils with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS); (3) fossil mineralogy with X-ray diffraction (XRD); and (4) histologic structures with thin section analyses. All fossils exhibited mass loss, which increased with decreasing pH conditions, and was greatest under pH 4 (477 to 803 mg loss). The elemental analyses with ICP-MS indicated an increase of both calcium (maximum increase of 315 ppm) and phosphorus (increase of 18 ppm) in aqueous solutions with increasing pH and a loss of those same elements from the fossils (maximum loss of 10 ppm Ca and 6 ppm P). XRD revealed loss of gypsum in all post-dissolution samples. Taken together, the results of ICP-MS and XRD suggest dissolution of the primary mineral phases, including hydroxylapatite, and secondary phases, particularly calcite and gypsum, resulting in an estimated mass loss at pH 4 of 23 to 28 mg per day. Thin section analysis showed degradation of both cortical and trabecular bone in all post-dissolution images, demonstrating physical changes to the fossils as a result of water-rock interactions. These findings constitute the first quantitative analysis of fossil dissolution rates and provide insights into this last stage of taphonomy, addressing a largely understudied potential bias in the vertebrate fossil record."
https://openalex.org/W4306154878,"Earthworm action and feeding have an important impact on a variety of microorganisms in the soil. However, the effects of the earthworm on Beauveria bassiana, a common entomopathogenic fungus in the biological control of pests, have been little studied. In this study, the epigeic earthworm species Eisenia fetida (Savigny) was selected to evaluate its impact on B. bassiana TST05 including its distribution in soil and its pathogenicity to target insects. By testing B. bassiana TST05 distribution, biomass in soil, viable spore germination rate, and pathogenicity to insect larvae after passing through the earthworm gut, the results showed that the activity and feeding of E. fetida promoted the B. bassiana TST05 diffusing downwards in the soil, while decreasing active fungal spores. After passing through the earthworm gut and excretion, the living B. bassiana individuals still had activity and pathogenicity to insects. The germination rate of the viable fungal spores was 15.09% and the infection rate to the insect larvae of Atrijuglans hetaohei Yang reached 62.35%, 80.95% and 100% after infection at 7 d, 10 d, and 14 d, respectively. The results showed that action and feeding of earthworms promoted the distribution of B. bassiana TST05 in soil, but decreased B. bassiana viable spores. This study is important for understanding the interaction between earthworms and B. bassiana in soil and for guiding the scientific application of B. bassiana in the biological control of pests."
https://openalex.org/W4306154883,"Background Despite the evidence-based effectiveness of diarrhoea treatment in preventing diarrhoea-related child mortality, the accessibility and utilization of diarrhoea treatments remain low in sub-Saharan Africa, even though these treatments are available. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of diarrhoea treatment among under-five children in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods This study involved cross-sectional analyses of secondary data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys of 30 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Percentages with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to summarise the prevalence of diarrhoea treatment. A multivariable multilevel binary logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the predictors of diarrhoea treatment among children under five years in sub-Saharan Africa. The regression results were presented using adjusted odds ratio with their accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Stata software version 16.0 was used for the analyses. Results The overall prevalence of diarrhoea treatment among under-five children in sub-Saharan Africa was 49.07% (95% CI = 44.50–53.64). The prevalence of diarrhoea treatment ranged from 23.93% (95% CI = 20.92–26.94) in Zimbabwe to 66.32% (95% CI = 61.67–70.97) in Liberia. Children aged 1 to 4 years, those whose mothers had at least primary education, those whose mothers had postnatal care visits, those whose mothers believed that permission to go and get medical help for self was a big problem, and those whose mothers’ partners had at least primary education were more likely to undergo diarrhoea treatment as compared to their counterparts. The odds of diarrhoea treatment increased with increasing wealth index with the highest odds among those in the richest quintile. Also, the odds of diarrhoea treatment was higher in the Central, Eastern, and Western geographical subregions compared to those in the Southern geographical subregion. However, children whose mothers were cohabiting, those whose mothers were exposed to watching television, and those living in female-headed households were less likely to undergo diarrhoea treatment. Conclusion The study found that the prevalence of diarrhoea treatment among children in sub-Saharan Africa was relatively low and varied across countries. The sub-regional estimates of diarrhoea treatment and identified associated factors can support country-specific needs assessments targeted at improving policy makers’ understanding of within-country disparities in diarrhoea treatment. Planned interventions (e.g., provision of quality and affordable supply of oral rehydration salts and zinc) should seek to scale up diarrhoea treatment uptake among under-five children in sub-Saharan Africa with much focus on the factors identified in this study."

Whereas the perforation site has been assumed to be in the branching of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA), we recently observed more proximal perforations. Methods Filament perforation was performed in CD1- (n = 10) and C57Bl/6N-mice (n = 9) ex vivo. The filament was left in place and the perforation site was microscopically assessed. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in CD1- (n = 9) and C57Bl/6J-mice (n = 29) and anatomical differences of the internal carotid artery (ICA) were determined. Results Whereas in C57Bl/6N-mice perforation occurred in the proximal intracranial ICA in 89% (n = 8), in CD1-mice the perforation site was in the proximal ICA in 50% (n = 5), in the branching between MCA and ACA in 40% (n = 4), and in the proximal ACA in 10% (n = 1). DSA revealed a stronger angulation (p&lt;0.001) of the ICA in CD1-mice (163.5±2.81°) compared to C57Bl/6J-mice (124.5±5.49°). Body weight and ICA-angle showed no significant correlation in C57Bl/6J- (r = -0.06, p weight/angle = 0.757) and CD1-mice (r = -0.468, p weight/angle = 0.242). Conclusion Filament perforation in mice occurs not only at the hitherto presumed branching between MCA and ACA, but seems to depend on mouse strain and anatomy as the proximal intracranial ICA may also be perforated frequently."
https://openalex.org/W4306154896,"The current study used a high frequency TMS protocol known as continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to test a model of hand choice that relies on competing interactions between the hemispheres of the posterior parietal cortex. Based on the assumption that cTBS reduces cortical excitability, the model predicts a significant decrease in the likelihood of selecting the hand contralateral to stimulation. An established behavioural paradigm was used to estimate hand choice in each individual, and these measures were compared across three stimulation conditions: cTBS to the left posterior parietal cortex, cTBS to the right posterior parietal cortex, or sham cTBS. Our results provide no supporting evidence for the interhemispheric competition model. We find no effects of cTBS on hand choice, independent of whether the left or right posterior parietal cortex was stimulated. Our results are nonetheless of value as a point of comparison against prior brain stimulation findings that, in contrast, provide evidence for a causal role for the posterior parietal cortex in hand choice."
https://openalex.org/W4306154907,"Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycaemia and entails many complications, including retinopathy and entrapment neuropathies, such as ulnar nerve entrapment (UNE) and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Hyperglycaemia damages the nerves of the retina, as well as peripheral nerves. There is a correlation between entrapment neuropathies and retinopathy in patients with diabetes, but whether patients with diabetic retinopathy are more prone to develop CTS and UNE is uncertain. Hence, the aim was to investigate if retinopathy can be used as a factor predicting the development of CTS and UNE. Data from 95,437 individuals from the National Diabetes Registry were merged with data from the Skåne Healthcare Registry. The population was analysed regarding prevalence of CTS or UNE and retinopathy status. Population characteristics were analysed using the Chi 2 -test, Student’s Independent T-test, and the Mann-Whitney U-test. Two logistic regression models were used to analyse the odds ratio (OR) for development of CTS and UNE depending on retinopathy status, adjusted for possible confounders. Both CTS and UNE were more frequent among those with retinopathy, compared to those without (CTS: 697/10,678 (6.5%) vs. 2756/83,151 (3.3%; p&lt;0.001), (UNE: 131/10,678 (1.2%) vs. 579/83,151 (0.7%; p&lt;0.001)). The OR for developing CTS for individuals with type 1 diabetes and retinopathy was 2.40 (95% CI 2.06–2.81; p&lt;0.001) and of developing UNE was 1.53 (0.96–2.43; p = 0.08). The OR for developing CTS for individuals with type 2 diabetes and retinopathy was 0.93 (0.81–1.08; p = 0.34) and for UNE 1.02 (0.74–1.40; p = 0.90). Diabetic retinopathy is associated with a higher risk of developing CTS and UNE, but the association seems to be mediated by the duration of the diabetes. Higher HbA1c levels, longer diabetes duration and higher BMI are significant risk factors for developing CTS and UNE in type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
