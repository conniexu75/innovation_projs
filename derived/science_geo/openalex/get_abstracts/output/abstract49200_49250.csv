https://openalex.org/W2082631326,"Axoplasm from the squid giant axon contains a soluble protein translocator that induces movement of microtubules on glass, latex beads on microtubules, and axoplasmic organelles on microtubules. We now report the partial purification of a protein from squid giant axons and optic lobes that induces these microtubule-based movements and show that there is a homologous protein in bovine brain. The purification of the translocator protein depends primarily on its unusual property of forming a high affinity complex with microtubuies in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, adenylyl imidodiphosphate. The protein, once released from microtubuies with ATP, migrates on gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular weight of 600 kilodaltons and contains 110–120 and 60–70 kilodalton polypeptides. This protein is distinct in molecular weight and enzymatic behavior from myosin or dynein, which suggests that it belongs to a novel class of force-generating molecules, for which we propose the name kinesin.

https://openalex.org/W1999197294,"Specific chromosomal translocations found in distinct neoplasms suggest that genes that flank such breakpoints play a critical role in transformation. We have characterized the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation present in over 60% of human follicular lymphomas. We exploited an unexpected rearrangement of an Ig heavy-chain gene to clone the chromosomal breakpoint. An element isolated from 18q21 mediated translocations in all four t(14;18) bearing cell lines and in six of 11 follicular lymphomas, but did not normally rearrange in other B or non-B cells. The breakpoints clustered within a small 4.3 kb region on chromosome 18. The breakpoints on chromosome 14 were focused within or immediately 5' to JH. These breakpoints retained the Ig enhancer region close to a new transcriptional unit identified on chromosome segment 18q21. Since none of the cellular oncogenes are known to map to 18q21, cloning this element provides an opportunity to characterize a potentially new transforming gene."
https://openalex.org/W1965399166,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a widely prevalent (1-3%) chronic systemic disease thought to have an autoimmune component; both humoral and cellular mechanisms have been implicated. Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is considered to be distinct from rheumatoid arthritis, and here damage is thought to be secondary to cartilage degeneration. In rheumatoid arthritis, immune complexes are present that consist exclusively of immunoglobulin, implying that this is both the 'antibody' (rheumatoid factor [RF]) and the 'antigen' (most commonly IgG). Autoantigenic reactivity has been localized to the constant-region (C gamma 2) domains of IgG. There is no evidence for a polypeptide determinant but carbohydrate changes have been reported. We have therefore conducted a study, simultaneously in Oxford and Tokyo, to compare in detail the N-glycosylation pattern of serum IgG (Fig. 1) isolated from normal individuals and from patients with either primary osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The results, which required an evaluation of the primary sequences of approximately 1,400 oligosaccharides from 46 IgG samples, indicate that: (1) IgG isolated from normal individuals, patients with RA and patients with OA contains different distributions of asparagine-linked bi-antennary complex-type oligosaccharide structures, (2) in neither disease is the IgG associated with novel oligosaccharide structures, but the observed differences are due to changes in the relative extent of galactosylation compared with normal individuals. This change results in a 'shift' in the population of IgG molecules towards those carrying complex oligosaccharides, one or both of whose arms terminate in N-acetylglucosamine. These two arthritides may therefore be glycosylation diseases, reflecting changes in the intracellular processing, or post-secretory degradation of N-linked oligosaccharides."

Model studies, based on the use of DDT, suggest that the ability of Phanerochaete chrysosporium to metabolize these compounds is dependent on the extracellular lignin-degrading enzyme system of this fungus."
https://openalex.org/W2074596664,"The regulation of cell-type specificity of immunoglobulin (Ig) μ heavy chain (H) gene expression was examined by introducing various hybrid genes containing Ig gene sequences combined with portions of a tissue-nonspecific transcription unit into lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells. Replacing the lymphocyte-specific IgH enhancer with a viral enhancer did not affect tissue specificity of μ Ig gene expression. We identified two new regulatory regions that provide transcriptional tissue specificity. First, the VH promoter region between position −154 and +57 was shown to direct lymphocyte-specific transcription of a bacterial gpt gene, even in the presence of a viral enhancer. Second, μ intragenic sequences, lacking the IgH enhancer, were found to regulate the level of accumulated Ig transcripts in a tissue-specific fashion. These results demonstrate that tissue specificity of Ig gene expression is not solely regulated by the enhancer but that the promoter, and as yet undefined intragenic sequences, contain lymphoid-specific regulatory information."

https://openalex.org/W2075915863,"The adenovirus type 2 encoded protein E3/19K binds to human histocompatibility class I antigens (HLA). This association occurs both in adenovirus-infected cells and in cells that have been transfected with the gene encoding the E3/19K protein. The formation of the HLA-E3/19K complex prevents the HLA antigens from being correctly processed by inhibiting their terminal glycosylation. This effect is specific for HLA antigens and does not generally involve the glycosyltransferases. Furthermore, the HLA-E3/19K association dramatically reduces the cell surface expression of the HLA antigens. This reduced level of antigens might influence the cytotoxic T cell response. Therefore, our results show a possible molecular mechanism whereby adenoviruses, and perhaps other viruses, delay or escape the cellular immune system of the host."

https://openalex.org/W1578637232,"Treatment of freshly isolated, bovine neurofilaments with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase removes over 90% of the phosphate groups from serine residues of the Mr 200,000 and 150,000 polypeptide components (NF200 and NF150). Dephosphorylated NF200 and NF150 remain associated with filaments, but migrate in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with reduced apparent molecular weights. Unusual migration appears to be due to modification at regions of these polypeptides that are peripheral to the neurofilament backbone as defined by limited chymotryptic digestion. Over 90 monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes located within the peripheral domain of native NF200 all show reduced affinity for dephosphorylated NF200. A single monoclonal antibody binds within the filament-associated domain of NF200 and its recognition of NF200 is unaffected upon treatment of neurofilaments with phosphatase. Around 50% of our monoclonal antibodies that bind NF150 monospecifically and at epitopes within its peripheral domain have reduced affinities for NF150 from phosphatase-treated filaments, while the remaining 50% bind native and dephosphorylated NF150 equally well. The smallest neurofilament component (NF70) contains few phosphate groups, most of which remain after treatment of neurofilaments with phosphatase. The resulting form of NF70 migrates normally in gels and its recognition by antibodies is unchanged. We conclude that phosphorylation modifies the structure of the two larger neurofilament polypeptides along domains that are peripheral to the filamentous backbone and that these effects are more pronounced for NF200 than for NF150."
https://openalex.org/W2000301898,"Certain mutant alleles at the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor locus produce receptors that bind LDL normally, but fail to cluster in coated pits and therefore cannot transport LDL into cells. We prepared genomic DNA libraries from cells of two individuals with this phenotype (internalization-defective familial hypercholesterolemia) and isolated the segment of the gene encoding the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. One mutant gene contains a single base substitution that changes a tryptophan codon (TGG) to a termination codon (TGA). This produces a receptor with only two amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain. The second mutant gene contains a four-base duplication, producing a frameshift that alters the reading frame. The cytoplasmic tail of this receptor has six of the normal amino acids plus eight additional amino acids. These data suggest that the signal for targeting the LDL receptor to coated pits resides in the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2050557902,"Preparation of bispecific antibodies by the chemical reassociation of monovalent fragments derived from monoclonal mouse immunoglobulin G1 is inefficient because of side reactions during reoxidation of the multiple disulfide bonds linking the heavy chains. These side reactions can be avoided by using specific dithiol complexing agents such as arsenite and effecting disulfide formation with a thiol activating agent such as 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). In this way bispecific antibodies were obtained in high yield and free of monospecific contaminants from monoclonal mouse immunoglobulin G1 fragments. The bispecific antibodies were used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1540432147,"The human platelet glycoprotein thrombospondin (TSP) binds specifically and with high affinity to sulfatides (galactosylceramide-I3-sulfate). Binding of 125I-TSP to lipids from sheep and human erythrocytes and human platelets resolved on thin layer chromatograms indicates that sulfatides are the only lipids in the membrane which bind TSP. Binding to less than 2 ng of sulfatide could be detected. TSP failed to bind to other purified lipids including cholesterol 3-sulfate, phospholipids, neutral glycolipids, and gangliosides. Binding of 125I-TSP was inhibited by unlabeled TSP, by low pH, and by reduction of intersubunit disulfide bonds with dithiothreitol. A monoclonal antibody against TSP (A2.5), which inhibits hemagglutination and agglutination of fixed activated platelets by TSP, strongly inhibited TSP binding to sulfatides. A second monoclonal antibody (C6.7), which inhibits hemagglutination and aggregation of thrombin-activated live platelets, weakly inhibited sulfatide binding. Binding was inhibited by high ionic strength and by some monosaccharide sulfates including methyl-alpha-D-GlcNAc-3-sulfate. Neutral sugars did not inhibit. Fucoidan, a sulfated fucan, strongly inhibited binding with 50% inhibition at 0.3 micrograms/ml fucoidan. Other sulfated polysaccharides including heparin and dextran sulfates were good inhibitors, whereas hyaluronic acid and keratan sulfate were very weak."

https://openalex.org/W2000568454,"Transgenic mice containing a microinjected rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) μ heavy chain gene were examined for the effects on DNA rearrangement of the endogenous Ig genes. Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) cell lines were isolated from pre-B cells of transgenic mice and of normal littermates. Microinjected μ gene RNA and a μ heavy chain protein were synthesized in every transgenic A-MuLV cell line. Only 10% of normal mouse A-MuLV transformants synthesized μ protein. A germ-line JH allele was observed in 40% of the transgenic lines, demonstrating that the block to endogenous Ig DNA rearrangement occurred at the first step of heavy chain DNA joining. All alleles were rearranged in normal mouse A-MuLV lines. Germ-line JH alleles were also detected in 10% of the transgenic hybridomas derived from proliferating B cells. Our results support a model of active prevention of rearrangement by the product of successfully rearranged μ genes."
https://openalex.org/W2000293531,"Microfluorometric recordings were made of changes in the concentration of cytosolic-free calcium in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells treated with quin 2, an intracellularly trapped dye, under several conditions. Nitroglycerin decreased calcium in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium and strongly and progressively decreased the extent of transient increases in calcium induced by repeated applications of caffeine in the absence of extracellular calcium. Therefore nitroglycerin probably decreases cytosolic-free calcium by accelerating the extrusion of calcium through the sarcolemmal membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2004997082,"The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) contains neurons that are part of the central neuronal network controlling rhythmic breathing movements in mammals. Nerve terminals within the NTS show immunoreactivity to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a neuropeptide that has potent stimulatory effects on respiration. By means of a brainstem slice preparation in vitro, TRH induced rhythmic bursting in neurons in the respiratory division of the NTS. The frequency of bursting was voltage-dependent and could be reset by short depolarizing current pulses. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, TRH produced rhythmic oscillations in membrane potential whose frequency was also voltage-dependent. These observations suggest that TRH modulates the membrane excitability of NTS neurons and allows them to express endogenous bursting activity."
https://openalex.org/W1969915151,"The Gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus has a complex life cycle1 during which large amounts of a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 19,000, known as protein S, are assembled into a spore surface coat by a process that specifically requires calcium ions2,3. The gene for protein S has been cloned and the DNA sequence shows that the gene product is composed of four internally repeated homologous sequences, each 40 amino acids long4. Although protein S resembles calmodulin both in its internally duplicated structure and its ability to bind calcium4, it apparently has a β-sheet secondary structure5 rather than the helix–loop–helix motifs that characterize the calmodulin family6–8. We now show that protein S has a striking homology with the β- and γ-crystallins of the vertebrate eye lens9–11 which are β-sheet proteins with internally duplicated structures. This implies that the β- and γ-crystallins evolved from already existing proteins, whose ancestors occurred in the prokaryotes. The biological function of protein S, as a closely packed, stable protein in a relatively dehydrated environment, has implications for the functions of crystalline, which are found closely packed in the lens fibre cells, where their stability is essential for maintenance of transparency."

https://openalex.org/W1991689596,"Normal distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells is insured by the proper functioning of the spindle. Homozygosity for a semi-lethal mutation of Drosophila melanogaster (abnormal spindle) altering this structure has the following effects: the mitotic cycle is arrested in metaphase, leading to a high frequency of polyploid cells; sex chromosome disjunction during male meiosis is severely affected, as revealed by the resulting exceptional (diplo and nullo) gametes (microscopic examination of spermiogenesis confirms this aberrant segregation); meiotic spindles of living cells are morphologically abnormal; and tubulins extracted from mutant larvae are normal in amount, electrophoretic mobility, and ability to form microtubules in vitro. The results suggest that the mutant phenotype is due to an altered structural component of the spindle other than tubulins."

The receptor is required for a normal T-cell immune response. High-resolution fluorescence-activated chromosome sorting and DNA spot-blot analysis with complementary DNA's for the interleukin-2 receptor indicated that the receptor gene was located on chromosome 9, 10, 11, or 12. In situ hybridization studies showed that the interleukin-2 receptor gene is on the short arm of chromosome 10, p14 → 15."
https://openalex.org/W1533992782,"Heat-labile enterotoxin produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and cholera enterotoxin are both composed of A and B subunits. The A subunit is an enzymatically active ADP-ribosylating subunit, while the B subunit, consisting of 103 amino acids, binds the toxin to a receptor, GM1-ganglioside, on the cell surface. A mutant isolated after treatment of E. coli producing heat-labile enterotoxin with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine produces a B subunit that is unable to bind to ganglioside. This subunit was purified and its primary amino acid sequence was determined. It differed from the native B subunit in only one amino acid at position 33; namely it had aspartate instead of glycine at position 33 from the N terminus. Thus glycine at position 33 from the N terminus of the B subunit is important for binding the B subunit to the ganglioside receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2147620378,"In a continued investigation of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase reaction with micellar discoidal complexes of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and various water soluble apolipoproteins, we prepared complexes containing human apo-E by the cholate dialysis method. These complexes were systematically compared to apo-A-I complexes synthesized under the same reaction conditions. Apo-E complexes (134 A in diameter) were slightly larger than apo-A-I complexes (110 A) but were very similar in terms of their protein and lipid content (2.4:0.10:1.0, egg phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/apolipoprotein, w/w) and in the percentage of apolipoprotein in alpha-helical structure (72-74%). Concentration and temperature-dependence experiments on the velocity of the lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase reaction revealed differences in apparent Km values and small differences in apparent Vmax but very similar activation energies (18-20 kcal/mol). These observations suggest that differences in lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activation by apo-A-I and apo-E are primarily a result of different affinities of the enzyme for the particles but that the rate-limiting step of the reaction is comparable for both complexes. Apo-E was found to be 18% as effective as apo-A-I in activating purified human lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase. Addition of free apo-A-I to apo-E complexes resulted in the exchange of bound for free apolipoprotein causing a slight increase in the reactivity with the enzyme when the incubation mixture was assayed. When the unbound apolipoproteins were removed by ultracentrifugation reisolated complexes containing both apo-E and apo-A-I demonstrated an even greater increase in reactivity with the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1488625988,"Pool sizes of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) in cultured cells are tightly regulated by i.al., the allosteric control of ribonucleotide reductase. We now determine the in situ activity of this enzyme from the turnover of the deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) pool in rapidly growing 3T6 mouse fibroblasts, as well as in cells whose DNA replication was inhibited by aphidicolin or amethopterin, by following under steady state conditions the path of isotope from [5-3H]cytidine into nucleotides, DNA, and deoxynucleosides excreted into the medium. In normal cells as much as 28% of the dCDP synthesized was excreted as deoxynucleoside (mostly deoxyuridine), leading to an accumulation of deoxyuridine in the medium. Inhibition with amethopterin slightly increased ribonucleotide reductase activity, while aphidicolin halved the activity of this enzyme (and thymidylate synthase). In both instances all dCDP synthesized was degraded and excreted as nucleosides. This continued synthesis and turnover in the absence of DNA synthesis is in contrast to the earlier found inhibition of dCTP (and dTTP) turnover when hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, was used to block DNA synthesis. To explain our results, we propose that substrate cycles between deoxyribonucleosides and their monophosphates, involving the activities of kinases and phosphatases, participate in the regulation of pool sizes. Within the cycles, a block of the reductase activates net phosphorylation, while inhibition of DNA polymerase stimulates degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1600773778,"An abiotic system is described which chemically catalyzes the formation of less than Glu-His-Pro-NH2 (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) from less than Glu-His-Pro-amino acid in the presence of copper, ascorbate, and molecular oxygen. Evidence is presented to support the participation of hydroxyl and carbon radicals as reaction intermediates in the production of a peptide amide and an aldehyde or ketone. The characteristics of this model system closely mimic the characteristics of enzymatic peptide amidation, and an oxidative, free-radical mechanism for enzymatic peptide amidation is proposed as an alternative to the mechanism for enzymatic amidation offered by Bradbury et al. (Bradbury, A. F., Finnie, M. D. A., and Smyth, D. G. (1982) Nature 298, 686-688)."

https://openalex.org/W2415702834,"Two methods were used for the quantitation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase protein. The first involved titrating the active site of the enzyme by reduction of the Schiff base between 3H-decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine and the pyruvate prosthetic group with sodium cyanoborohydride. The second method was radioimmunoassay with rabbit antiserum which was used to determine the total immunoreactive enzyme protein. It was found that the increased S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity produced in rat prostate by treatment with alpha-difluoromethylornithine and in both prostate and liver by methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) were due entirely to increases in the amount of enzyme protein. The ratio of enzyme activity to protein (measured by either method) remained constant in rats treated with the drugs. Treatment with 2% alpha-difluoromethylornithine in the drinking water for 3 days increased prostatic S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase protein by 5-fold. A substantial part, but not all, of this increase could be accounted for by a slowing of the rate of degradation of the enzyme. The half-life for loss of activity and titratable protein after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide was increased from 35 to 108 min by treatment with alpha-difluoromethylornithine. However, the half-life for loss of immunoreactive protein which was considerably longer was only increased from 139 to 213 min. The molecular weight of the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase subunit determined by immunoblotting was 32,000, and no smaller immunoreactive fragments were detected. These results indicate that spermidine depletion produced by alpha-difluoromethylornithine affects the degradation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase at an early step involving the loss of the active site without substantial breakdown of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1594867159,"The mechanism of the inactivation of the major phenobarbital-inducible isozyme of rat liver cytochrome P-450 (P-450 PB-B2) by chloramphenicol has been investigated. Preparations of the enzyme from animals treated in vivo with chloramphenicol (CAP PB-B2) have been isolated, and their catalytic, spectral, and physical properties have been compared with those of the native PB-B2. The CAP PB-B2 exhibited: 1) a 60-70% loss in the rate of NADPH-supported monooxygenase activity with the substrates benzphetamine, 7-ethoxycoumarin, and p-nitroanisole; 2) a 60% decrease in the extent of enzymatic P-450 reduction catalyzed by NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions; 3) a 60% decrease in the steady-state level of the ferrous dioxygen complex in the presence of substrates; 4) a 60% decrease in the magnitude of the type I spectral change induced by benzphetamine; and 5) a shift in the wavelength maximum for the chemically reduced ferrous-carbonyl complex from 450 to 451.5 nm. On the other hand, the ability of the CAP PB-B2 to catalyze the iodosobenzene-supported metabolism of 7-ethoxycoumarin and p-nitroanisole was unaltered. The results are consistent with a scheme whereby the binding of metabolites of chloramphenicol to amino acid residues in the PB-B2 close to the heme moiety blocks electron transport from NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, thereby leading to a loss of monooxygenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1522779323,"The metabolism of arachidonic acid by washed human platelets was investigated. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid was extensively converted to [1-14C]12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. In addition, several minor labeled products were formed with a considerably lower specific activity, indicating their preferential formation from endogenous substrate. These were dihydroxy metabolites of arachidonic acid with conjugated triene structures and were identified as 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (three isomers) and 8,15-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (three isomers). The identification was based on comparison with reference compounds with respect to chromatographic properties, characteristic UV spectra, and mass spectrometry of several derivatives. Bradykinin (10(-8)-10(-5) M) was found to enhance the formation of all these compounds. In addition, the monohydroxy acid fraction was found to contain 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. The present investigation thus demonstrates the occurrence of a 15-lipoxygenase in human platelets in addition to the previously known 12-lipoxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1584756575,"The results of the present experiment are shown in terms of the transport of protoheme from mitochondria to apocytochrome b5 when fresh rat liver mitochondria, apocytochrome b5, and cytosol were incubated. The heme transfer protein was purified from rat liver cytosol up to approximately 133-140-fold with a 43% yield by the procedure discussed herein, including Sephadex G-75 and CM-cellulose column chromatography. The final preparation showed apparent homogeneity upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Its native form was found to be a dimeric protein with a Mr = 45,000 which consists of a subunit with a Mr = 23,000. In the transporting system, the heme transfer depended on the concentration of mitochondria (donor), apocytochrome b5 (acceptor), and purified transfer protein, respectively. Omission of one of these components led to an almost complete loss of the transfer activity. The transport of mitochondrial protoheme was a rapid reaction which showed approximate linearity until 1.5 min and after that it became saturated. When the functional capacity was tested by the NADH-cytochrome c reductase system, the reconstituted cytochrome b5 expressed its complete original catalytic properties, as well as its characteristic absorption spectra for the hemoprotein. Furthermore, the detailed physicochemical and immunological characterization of the transfer protein provided evidence that the protein is identical with soluble glutathione S-transferase, which conjugates glutathione with a variety of electrophilic compounds. At least one of the glutathione S-transferase isozymes observed was identified as GST-C2, which comprises the subunit of Yb'Yb' by the immunoprecipitation reaction using various anti-glutathione S-transferase isozyme antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1483444054,"Studies on the recycling of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) during protein synthesis in normal and heme-deficient reticulocyte lysates indicate that eIF-2 binds physiologically to the 60 S ribosomal subunit. Several findings suggest that the 60 S subunit serves as a carrier for eIF-2 during protein synthesis. The addition of purified eIF-2 (beta-32P) to normal hemin-supplemented lysates results in its binding to polyribosomal 60 S subunits; the binding is temperature-dependent. In lysates inhibited by heme deficiency, phosphorylated eIF-2 alpha can be detected on polyribosomal 60 S subunits early in the initial linear phase of protein synthesis; after polyribosomal disaggregation and shut-off of protein synthesis, phosphorylated eIF-2 alpha accumulates on free 60 S ribosome subunits and on the 60 S subunits of 80 S ribosome couples. The phosphorylated eIF-2 alpha associated with the 60 S subunits in heme-deficient lysates appears to be present as the binary complex [eIF-2 (alpha P) X GDP]; the binding of this complex to the 60 S subunit is tight and is not affected by treatment with 25 mM EDTA or by sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Reversal of the inhibition of protein synthesis in heme-deficient lysates by the addition of reversing factor results in a rapid binding of reversing factor to the 60 S subunits and a concomitant dissociation of [eIF-2(alpha P) X GDP]. These findings suggest that the [eIF-2 X GDP] binary complex formed during the assembly of the 80 S initiation complex binds to the 60 S subunit of polyribosomes and is subsequently released by the action of reversing factor."
https://openalex.org/W191377311,"The effect of glucose on the metabolism of phospholipids in pancreatic islets was studied with three radioactive phospholipid precursors, [32P]orthophosphate, [3H]myoinositol, and [3H]arachidonic acid, to determine the conditions necessary for studying the breakdown of prelabeled phospholipids. Islets were incubated in the presence of a radioactive precursor for 60 or 90 min and in the presence of either 3.3 or 16.7 mM glucose to prelabel phospholipids. To study the breakdown of prelabeled phospholipid, the unincorporated precursor was removed and the islets were reincubated for 15 or 20 min under conditions that either did or did not stimulate insulin release. Prelabeling in the presence of a noninsulinotropic concentration of glucose (3.3 mM) supported the incorporation of precursors into almost all islet phospholipids studied. Prelabeling in an insulinotropic concentration of glucose (16.7 mM) increased the incorporation of precursors into a number of phospholipids even more; and reincubation in 16.7 mM glucose caused a rapid loss of radioactivity from specific phospholipids (phosphatidylinositol and/or phosphatidylcholine, depending on the precursor). This breakdown was observed only when islets had been prelabeled in 16.7 mM glucose. The amount of radioactivity lost from phospholipid corresponded roughly to the additional amount incorporated during the prelabeling in the high concentration of glucose. Radioactivity in phospholipids in islets prelabeled in 3.3 mM glucose or in nonsecretagogue metabolic fuels, such as malate plus pyruvate, did not decrease when the islets were subsequently exposed to 16.7 mM glucose, nor did it decrease in 3.3 mM glucose when these islets had been prelabeled in 16.7 mM glucose. Glyceraldehyde, an insulin secretagogue, but not galactose or L-glucose which are not insulin secretagogues, stimulated phospholipid breakdown in islets that had been prelabeled in 16.7 mM glucose. Depriving islets of extracellular calcium, a condition that inhibits insulin release, inhibited phospholipid breakdown. The results suggest that pancreatic islets contain a glucose-responsive and a glucose-unresponsive phospholipid pool. The glucose-responsive pool becomes labeled and undergoes rapid turnover only under stimulatory conditions and may play a role in the stimulus-secretion coupling of insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1592342271,"The membrane insertion, processing, and intracellular transport of the mouse macrophage Fc receptor for IgG1/IgG2b was studied using specific mono- and polyclonal anti-receptor antibodies. By immunoprecipitation from Triton X-114 lysates of radiolabeled J774 cells, we determined that the mature 60-kDa receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as a 53-kDa precursor. Digestion of the precursor with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F demonstrated that the receptor consisted of a 37-kDa polypeptide to which four asparagine-linked oligosaccharides were attached. Proteinase K treatment of isolated microsomes indicated that the receptor also has a putative 15-kDa cytoplasmic domain apparently recognized by at least one anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody. An additional 15-kDa domain was found to be inaccessible to proteolysis from either side of the membrane. Pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine-, [3H]mannose-, and [3H]galactose-labeled cells showed that processing of the receptor's N-linked oligosaccharides occurred rapidly (t1/2 = 15 min) and resulted in the conversion of at least three of the chains to complex endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-resistant forms. O-Linked oligosaccharides were not detected. Fc receptor was detected on the plasma membrane 30 min after its synthesis. Transport of newly synthesized receptors to the plasma membrane was slowed but not blocked by incubation of J774 cells at 20 degrees C or by the carboxylic ionophore monensin, although monensin completely inhibited the galactosylation of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1627062672,"Timkovich and co-workers have recently proposed a chlorin macrocycle structure for the heme d1 prosthetic group isolated from cytochrome cd1 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Paracoccus denitrificans (Timkovich, R., Cork, M. S., and Taylor, P. V. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1577-1585; 15089-15093). However, this chlorin structure deduced by them is not entirely consistent with the spectral data. An alternative structure is proposed here based on the available spectral evidence. It is suggested that heme d1 in vivo is not a chlorin, but a dioxo-isobacteriochlorin having two adjacent pyrrole rings saturated."
https://openalex.org/W1505011996,"Abstract We have isolated from an arginase-deficient polyamine-dependent Chinese hamster ovary cell line a new mutant strain that has greatly increased ornithine decarboxylase activity. This enables the cells, in the absence of ornithine, to decarboxylate lysine into cadaverine (diaminopentane) that is further converted into N-(3-aminopropyl)cadaverine and N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)cadaverine. These unusual polyamines can support the growth of the cells without added polyamines derived from ornithine. Immunoreactive ornithine decarboxylase-like protein was clearly increased in the mutant cells but could not solely account for the greatly increased enzyme activity. Southern blot analysis of DNA hybridized to a plasmid carrying ornithine decarboxylase-cDNA revealed at least a 32-fold amplification of the ornithine decarboxylase gene. Ornithine decarboxylase-mRNA concentration was also highly increased in the cells. The half-life of the enzyme and the Km for ornithine were not altered from those of the parental cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1665913188,"Soluble complexes were formed between C1q, a subunit of the first component of human complement, and four different Waldenstrom IgM proteins at reduced ionic strengths. The equilibria between these complexes and the free proteins were studied in the ultracentrifuge. Complex formation was found to be a very sensitive function of the salt concentration, and at physiological ionic strength complex formation was negligible. The complexes were cross-linked with a water-soluble carbodiimide and separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Both 22 S 1:1 and 26 S 2:1 C1q X IgM complexes were formed; stoichiometry was established by cross-linking 125I-C1q with 131I-IgM and determining the ratios of the specific activities of the gradient-purified materials. The association process was studied as a function of protein concentration and was analyzed by Scatchard and Hill plots to yield stoichiometry, association constant, and degree of cooperativity. The results indicated that IgM has two identical and independent binding sites for C1q. The intrinsic association constant was found to vary between 10(6) M-1 at 0.084 M ionic strength to 10(4) M-1 at physiological ionic strength; the slope of the log-log plot gave a value of -6.0. The cross-linked complexes were examined by electron microscopy, and the C1q appeared to be attached to the IgM through the C1q heads, implying that the biologically significant binding sites were involved in this interaction. For the 2:1 complexes, the two C1q appeared to attach to opposite surfaces of the IgM, suggesting the presence of a pseudo-2-fold axis lying in the plane of the IgM disk."
https://openalex.org/W1586012026,"Thioredoxin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena 7119 serves as electron donor to ribonucleotide reductase and as a protein disulfide reductase. This small, heat-stable protein was found to have structural and functional similarities to thioredoxins from both bacterial and mammalian sources. We here report the complete primary structure of Anabaena thioredoxin. The structure was determined by analysis of peptides obtained after cleavage with cyanogen bromide, Staphylococcus aureus protease, and trypsin. The protein consists of 106 residues with the following amino acid sequence: Ser-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gln-Val-Thr-Asp- Ser-Thr-Phe-Lys-Gln-Glu-Val-Leu-Asp-Ser-Asp-Val-Pro-Val-leu-Val-Asp-Phe- Trp-Ala-Pro-Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Arg-Met-Val-Ala-Pro-Val-Val-Asp-Glu- Ile-Ala-Gln-Gln-Tyr-Glu-Gly-Lys-Ile-Lys-Val-Val-Lys-Val-Asn-Thr-Asp- Glu-Asn-Pro-Gln-Val-Ala-Ser-Gln-Tyr-Gly-Ile-Arg-Ser-Ile-Pro-Thr-Leu- Met-Ile-Phe-Lys-Gly-Gly-Gln-Lys-Val-Asp-Met-Val-Val-Gly-Ala-Val-Pro- Lys-Thr-Thr-Leu-Ser-Gln-Thr-Leu-Glu-Lys-His-Leu. The sequence of Anabaena thioredoxin shows a definite homology to the protein from Escherichia coli, with 49% residue identities occurring in the proteins when aligned at the active site disulfide."
https://openalex.org/W1524126081,"Near-infrared light scattering and gel electrophoresis were used to monitor the interaction between rhodopsin and G-protein at photoreceptor disc membranes. It is found that substitution of one SH hydrogen at the G alpha-subunit by N-ethylmaleimide or thionitrobenzoate still allows dark binding of the G-unit to the membrane but blocks its light binding to rhodopsin. Repair of the modification restores the interaction of the proteins. Evidence is provided that substitution by the less bulky cyanide is also able to remove the hindrance to light binding. The rhodopsin-G interaction is reduced in proportion to bound N-ethylmaleimide, and the interaction kinetics remain constant over the measurable range. GTP/GDP exchange at the G-protein after interaction with rhodopsin does not reduce the accessibility of the relevant SH group. In contrast to the effect of G-protein modification, even exhaustive modification of rhodopsin has no effect on the dark and light binding of G-protein."
https://openalex.org/W1589840073,"The direct effects of insulin and glucose on glycogen accumulation were compared using monolayers of chicken embryo hepatocytes which, when cultured in chemically defined medium without hormones, retain viability for several days but become depleted of glycogen. The data strongly suggest that insulin is the major direct signal for hepatic glycogen synthesis, while glucose supports glycogen accumulation primarily in its role as a substrate. Insulin alone, when added to the cells in physiological concentrations, either shortly after isolation or throughout culture, restored glycogen to the maximal levels found in the liver of the fed chicken. Addition of increasing amounts of glucose in the absence of insulin, in contrast, yielded proportional but limited increases in glycogen deposition attaining not more than 30% of the maximal storage capacity of the cells. This hormone-independent glycogenesis was characterized by a 30-min burst of glycogen deposition immediately following a stepped increase of glucose, with no detectable change in glycogen synthase activity. Insulin-dependent glycogenesis evidenced a much slower rate of glycogen deposition and was accompanied by a near tripling of glycogen synthase activity. Insulin-induced glycogen stores were broken down following removal of the hormone, even when glucose was present in great excess, indicating that the cells require insulin to maintain as well as build up maximal levels of glycogen. In the presence of glucagon, insulin-induced glycogen stores were rapidly degraded, but glucose-induced glycogenesis was not inhibited. The actions of insulin and glucose in this system are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those that have been observed in the diabetic animal."
https://openalex.org/W1506095788,"Calcium uptake by an endoplasmic reticulum-enriched membrane fraction isolated from rat small intestine was investigated using a rapid filtration technique. Calcium sequestration was stimulated by the presence of ATP and released by the calcium ionophore A23187. ATP stimulation of calcium uptake was dependent on the presence of magnesium, inhibited by vanadate, and refractory to calmodulin. Kinetic studies revealed a K0.5 for the ATP-stimulated uptake of 62.5 nM Ca and a Jmax of 1.4 nmol of Ca/mg protein X min. A high dietary calcium load stimulated maximal uptake by 80% with no change in affinity. The magnitude of maximal uptake and the high affinity of this transport system suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum may play a significant role in cytosolic calcium sequestration and that extracellular calcium leads to modulation of intracellular endoplasmic reticulum calcium buffering."
https://openalex.org/W1573660183,"Murine interferon-gamma (MuIFN-gamma), produced by the T-cell lymphoma, L12-R4, and stimulated with phorbol myristic acetate, was purified by rat monoclonal antibodies AN-18.17.24. The purified product retained its biologic activity and consisted of two proteins (Mr = 17,500 and 16,500), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Both species were found to be glycosylated, since their Mr values decreased to 14,500 and 13,500 when the producing cells were stimulated in the presence of tunicamycin. Analysis of intracellular and secreted forms in the presence of [35S] methionine revealed that MuIFN-gamma is synthetized as a single peptide of Mr = 17,500 and undergoes proteolytic cleavage during or after secretion. Peptide mapping by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography showed indeed that the peptide profile of both species is very similar, suggesting a high degree of homology in the primary structure. These results demonstrate that the molecular heterogeneity of the MuIFN-gamma is probably the outcome of proteolytic processing during or after secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1523487122,"1H nuclear magnetic resonance has been employed to study the calcium-binding properties of the NH2- and COOH-terminal calcium-binding sites of the porcine intestinal calcium-binding protein. The protein was titrated with calcium in the presence of the chelator EDTA in order to determine the association constants of the protein for calcium relative to the known association constant of EDTA for calcium. The resulting data were compared with various models for the binding of calcium to two sites on the protein. Models were considered for which the two sites in the apoprotein have either intrinsically equal or unequal affinities for calcium. For each of these two cases, positive cooperativity, no cooperativity, and negative cooperativity were considered. The data fit best for the case of random binding to two independent sites with equivalent association constants of 1.0 +/- 0.1 X 10(7) M-1. The case of ordered binding to two sites with intrinsically different affinities, with concomitant positive affinity between the two sites so that the effective association constants were made equal, could not be mathematically excluded when only one protein NMR resonance is considered but can be shown to be implausible when the whole spectrum is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2120528188,"The sodium-dependent transport system for branched-chain amino acids of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was solubilized with n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and reconstituted into liposomes by a detergent-Sephadex G-50 gel filtration procedure. The reconstituted proteoliposomes exhibited Na+-dependent counterflow and Na+-gradient-driven transport of L-leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-valine. The leucine counterflow was specifically inhibited by only branched-chain amino acids and the uphill transport of two species of amino acids among the three was induced by counterflow of the other substrate. These results show that the transport system for branched-chain amino acids was reconstituted into liposomes from P. aeruginosa cells and strongly suggest that three branched-chain amino acids are transported by a common carrier system."
https://openalex.org/W2134207813,"Complexes between Bacillus subtilus RNA polymerase and 32P-labeled DNA were irradiated with UV light and digested with nuclease; electrophoresis and autoradiography were used to identify the polymerase subunits cross-linked to DNA. These experiments showed: 1) that cross-linkage of promoter complexes yielded predominantly the beta and sigma subunits; 2) that beta, beta', and sigma were detected in non-promoter complexes; 3) that addition of the delta subunit or high concentrations of NaCl decreased cross-linkage of all subunits, especially the cross-linkage of the sigma subunit in non-promoter complexes and the binding of polymerase at DNA ends; 4) that different patterns of cross-linkage were obtained at 0 degrees C (conditions favoring the formation of closed complexes) and 37 degrees C (conditions favoring the formation of open complexes); and 5) predominantly beta and possibly alpha were cross-linked by irradiation of core-DNA complexes whereas similar experiments with core-delta complexed to DNA showed the efficient cross-linkage of beta' and beta."
https://openalex.org/W2159826703,"The interaction of the chloroplast elongation factor Tu (EF-Tuchl) from Euglena gracilis with guanine nucleotides and aminoacyl-tRNA has been investigated. The apparent dissociation constant at 37 degrees C for the EF-Tuchl X GDP complex is about 3 X 10(-7) M and for the EF-Tuchl X GTP complex, it is about 1 order of magnitude higher. The sulfhydryl modifying reagent N-ethylmaleimide severely inhibits the polymerization activity of Euglena EF-Tuchl. In the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, the dissociation constant for the modified EF-Tuchl X GDP complex is increased by an order of magnitude. Conversely, both GDP and GTP protect EF-Tuchl from the modification. The polymerization activity of EF-Tuchl is also sensitive to the antibiotic kirromycin. In the presence of kirromycin, the apparent dissociation constant for the EF-Tuchl X GTP complex is lowered 10-fold. The interaction of aminoacyl-tRNA with EF-Tuchl was investigated by examining the ability of EF-Tuchl to prevent the spontaneous hydrolysis of Phe-tRNA and by gel filtration chromatography. The binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to EF-Tuchl occurs only in the presence of GTP indicating the formation of the ternary complex EF-Tuchl X GTP X Phe-tRNA. The effect of kirromycin on the interaction was also investigated. In the presence of kirromycin, no interaction between EF-Tuchl and Phe-tRNA is observed, even in the presence of GTP."
