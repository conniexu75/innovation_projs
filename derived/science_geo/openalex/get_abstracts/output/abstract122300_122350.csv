The mechanisms by which homocysteine may promote vascular diseases have not been elucidated yet. In the present study, we have applied a modified nonradioactive differential display analysis to evaluate changes in gene expression induced by homocysteine treatment of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We identified six up-regulated and one down-regulated genes. One up-regulated gene was GRP78/BiP, a stress protein, suggesting that misfolded proteins would accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum because of redox potential changes caused by homocysteine. Another up-regulated gene encoded a bifunctional enzyme with activities of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, which is involved in a homocysteine metabolism. A third up-regulated gene encoded activating transcription factor 4, and a fourth was a gene whose function is not identified yet. The remaining three were novel genes. We isolated a full-length cDNA of one of the up-regulated genes from a HUVEC library. It encoded a novel protein with 394 amino acids, which was termed reducing agents and tunicamycin-responsive protein (RTP). Northern blot analysis revealed that RTP gene expression was induced in HUVEC after 4 h incubation with homocysteine. RTP mRNA was also observed in unstimulated cells and induced by not only homocysteine but also 2-mercaptoethanol and tunicamycin. The mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. These observations indicate that homocysteine can alter the expressivity of multiple genes, including a stress protein and several novel genes. These responses may contribute to atherogenesis.

The best known is cystathionine β-synthase deficiency. A much rarer form of homocysteinemia has been caused by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase deficiency. A more recent study indicated that mutations of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase also caused homocysteinemia. This type of mutant protein occurred at a quite high frequency of approximately 38% of unselected chromosomes in French Canadian people (5Frosst P. Blom H.J. Milos R. Goyette P. Sheppard C.A.

Patients with severe homocysteinemia suffer from arterial and/or venous thromboembolic events at early age. Furthermore, several lines of statistical evidence suggest that mild homocysteinemia probably caused by the heterozygosity also represents a significant independent risk factor for premature vascular diseases (1Mudd S.H.

Kane W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1909-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) activities were enhanced by incubating EC with homocysteine. Homocysteine treatment of EC reduced generation of activated protein C (8Rodgers G.M. Conn M.T. Blood. 1990; 75: 895-901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thrombomodulin activity (9Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 10Hayashi T. Honda G. Suzuki K.

Invest. 1993; 91: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, homocysteine increased the affinity of atherogenic apolipoprotein(a) for fibrin (13Harpel P.C. Chang V.T. Borth W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition to these thrombogenic properties, inhibitory effects of homocysteine on protein transport system were reported. Thrombomodulin transport to the cell surface was prevented by homocysteine (9Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and the same secretion problems were observed during the biosynthesis of multimeric glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (14Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 683-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also reported that vascular smooth muscle cell growth, not EC growth, was promoted by homocysteine (15Tsai J.-C. Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6369-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), which might lead to homocysteine-induced arteriosclerosis.All these observations suggest that homocysteine works against the cells in three ways. One possible mechanism would be that it serves as a trigger directly or indirectly to switch on the expression of certain genes. Another would be that it prevents protein exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface or the extracellular space. The third one would be that it partially reduces certain proteins such as thrombomodulin and lipoprotein(a) to modify their functional activities. Consequences of all these changes cause vascular cell dysfunction that could be important in homocysteine-induced vascular diseases.In the present study, to evaluate changes in gene expression in homocysteine-stimulated vascular EC, a differential display analysis was performed. As the result, we have identified seven genes under the influence of homocysteine.DISCUSSIONRecently, it has become clear that homocysteinemia is a major independent risk factor for vascular diseases (1Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovy F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 693-734Google Scholar, 2Ueland P.M. Refsum H. J. Lab. Clin.

Med. 1996; 2: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). For this reason, the mechanism by which altered gene expression occurs in response to homocysteine is an important topic for investigation. To date, induction of tissue factor mRNA expression (6Fryer R.H. Wilson B.D. Gubler D.B. Fitzgerald L.A. Rodgers G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and slight increase of thrombomodulin mRNA (9Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) by homocysteine were reported in HUVEC, and increased mRNA levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin A in rat smooth muscle cells were demonstrated (15Tsai J.-C. Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6369-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified seven genes (GRP78/BiP, NMDMC, ATF-4, HUMORF12, and three novel genes) whose mRNA levels were altered after 4 h of homocysteine treatment of HUVEC, although changes in mRNA expression of other genes, which return to the basal level within 4 h or are induced after 4 h, might be missed.GRP78/BiP is an ER-resident molecular chaperone binding to a wide repertoire of proteins traversing through the ER, where proteins are post-translationally modified and then destined for transport to the Golgi apparatus, the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or the cell exterior. Since GRP78/BiP transcription is induced by glucose or oxygen starvation (30Roll D.E. Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Sutherland R.M. Smith H.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 103: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or by the reagents tunicamycin (29Olden K. Pratt R.M. Jaworski C. Yamada K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), glucosamine, 2-deoxyglucose (31Pouyssegur J. Shiu R.P.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1977; 11: 941-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), 2-mercaptoethanol (32Whelan S.A. Hightower L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or calcium ionophore A23187 (33Resendez Jr., E. Attenello J.W. Grafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), one common characteristic of stress conditions leading to the GRP78/BiP induction is considered to be accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Lentz and Sadler indicated that homocysteine inhibited thrombomodulin cell-surface expression (9Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and von Willebrand factor processing and secretion (14Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 683-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by preventing exit from the ER. Because redox potential changes created by homocysteine would affect the proper disulfide formation of certain proteins, these observations could be explained by binding of misfolded proteins with GRP78/BiP and their retention in the ER. Therefore, the increase of GRP78/BiP mRNA indicates that homocysteine-stimulated HUVEC is under such a stressful condition. Up-regulation of ATF-4 observed in this study also may reflect the stress-inducing effects of homocysteine, because ATF-4 mRNA is known to be induced by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration (21Tsujimoto A. Nyunoya H. Morita T. Sato T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by anoxia (34Estes S.D. Stoler D.L. Anderson G.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).We identified three previously uncharacterized genes whose mRNA levels were altered by homocysteine treatment and succeeded in isolating one almost full-length cDNA clone, pGC4-c. Its open reading frame encoded a novel polypeptide, termed RTP. Three-tandem repeats of GTRSRSHTSE in its C-terminal region was a novel motif. RTP did not have an apparent signal sequence, a transmembrane domain, or an ER-retention sequence. The amino acid sequence showed a 28% identity to ZK1073.1, a predicted protein of C. elegans (Fig. 4). In addition, Northern blot analysis showed the ubiquitous tissue distribution of RTP mRNA (Fig. 7). These two characteristics of RTP suggest that this protein might serve an essential, housekeeping function.We investigated the effects of various conditions on RTP mRNA expression. The expression was increased by not only homocysteine but also other sulfhydryl reagents, cysteine and 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 6A). The induction was also observed by treatment with tunicamycin. These observations in mRNA induction of RTP were quite similar to those of GRP78/BiP (Fig. 6B). This may relate to functional properties of RTP.Homocysteine treatment of HUVEC also increased NMDMC mRNA. Human NMDMC is a mitochondrial bifunctional enzyme that has activities of both 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (35Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pathway of homocysteine catabolism is either transsulfuration to form cystathionine catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase or remethylation to form methionine catalyzed by methyltransferase. Because the latter requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor, the increase of NMDMC mRNA would contribute to activation of the remethylation pathway. This speculation is supported by the previous reports of existence of the homocysteine-uptake system (36Ewadh M.J.A. Tudball N. Rose F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and homocysteine metabolic enzymes (37Wang J. Dudman N.P.B. Wilcken D.E.L. Lynch J.F. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 97: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in cultured EC. It would be a reasonable assumption that the same remethylation pathway would be activated in the cells of homocysteinemia patients.The major clinical manifestations of homocysteinemia include mental retardation, ectopia lentis, osteoporosis, skeletal abnormalities, fatty liver, and vascular disease. We suppose that such various symptoms are caused by the elevated concentration of intracellular, rather than extracellular (plasma), homocysteine in various cells and tissues of the body. Cell functions in homocysteinemia patients may be altered through the changes in gene expression identified in the present study because intracellular homocysteine levels would be much higher than normal. In fact, de Groot et al. (38de Groot P.G. Willems C. Boers G.H.J. Gonsalves M.D. van Aken W.G. van Mourik J.A. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 13: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) indicated that EC derived from homocysteinemia were more susceptible to sulfur-containing amino acids than normal EC, resulting in EC dysfunction.The present study indicates that cell injury by homocysteine leads to a stress condition probably caused by alteration of the intracellular redox potential and induces great changes in gene expression. Further investigations, including studies of novel gene transcripts such as RTP, are required to reveal the underlying mechanisms of homocysteine-induced cell injury, and the results may throw light on the pathophysiology of homocysteinemia.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and the same secretion problems were observed during the biosynthesis of multimeric glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (14Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 683-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also reported that vascular smooth muscle cell growth, not EC growth, was promoted by homocysteine (15Tsai J.-C. Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6369-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), which might lead to homocysteine-induced arteriosclerosis. endothelial cell human umbilical vein endothelial cell endoplasmic reticulum polymerase chain reaction rapid amplification of 5′-ends of cDNA plaque-forming units NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase reducing agents and tunicamycin-responsive protein 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid base pair(s). All these observations suggest that homocysteine works against the cells in three ways. One possible mechanism would be that it serves as a trigger directly or indirectly to switch on the expression of certain genes. Another would be that it prevents protein exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface or the extracellular space. The third one would be that it partially reduces certain proteins such as thrombomodulin and lipoprotein(a) to modify their functional activities. Consequences of all these changes cause vascular cell dysfunction that could be important in homocysteine-induced vascular diseases. In the present study, to evaluate changes in gene expression in homocysteine-stimulated vascular EC, a differential display analysis was performed. As the result, we have identified seven genes under the influence of homocysteine. DISCUSSIONRecently, it has become clear that homocysteinemia is a major independent risk factor for vascular diseases (1Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovy F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1989: 693-734Google Scholar, 2Ueland P.M. Refsum H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1989; 114: 473-501PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rees M.M.

For this reason, the mechanism by which altered gene expression occurs in response to homocysteine is an important topic for investigation. To date, induction of tissue factor mRNA expression (6Fryer R.H. Wilson B.D. Gubler D.B. Fitzgerald L.A. Rodgers G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and slight increase of thrombomodulin mRNA (9Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) by homocysteine were reported in HUVEC, and increased mRNA levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin A in rat smooth muscle cells were demonstrated (15Tsai J.-C. Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6369-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified seven genes (GRP78/BiP, NMDMC, ATF-4, HUMORF12, and three novel genes) whose mRNA levels were altered after 4 h of homocysteine treatment of HUVEC, although changes in mRNA expression of other genes, which return to the basal level within 4 h or are induced after 4 h, might be missed.GRP78/BiP is an ER-resident molecular chaperone binding to a wide repertoire of proteins traversing through the ER, where proteins are post-translationally modified and then destined for transport to the Golgi apparatus, the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or the cell exterior. Since GRP78/BiP transcription is induced by glucose or oxygen starvation (30Roll D.E. Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Sutherland R.M. Smith H.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 103: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or by the reagents tunicamycin (29Olden K. Pratt R.M. Jaworski C. Yamada K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), glucosamine, 2-deoxyglucose (31Pouyssegur J. Shiu R.P.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1977; 11: 941-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), 2-mercaptoethanol (32Whelan S.A. Hightower L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or calcium ionophore A23187 (33Resendez Jr., E. Attenello J.W. Grafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), one common characteristic of stress conditions leading to the GRP78/BiP induction is considered to be accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Lentz and Sadler indicated that homocysteine inhibited thrombomodulin cell-surface expression (9Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and von Willebrand factor processing and secretion (14Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 683-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by preventing exit from the ER. Because redox potential changes created by homocysteine would affect the proper disulfide formation of certain proteins, these observations could be explained by binding of misfolded proteins with GRP78/BiP and their retention in the ER. Therefore, the increase of GRP78/BiP mRNA indicates that homocysteine-stimulated HUVEC is under such a stressful condition. Up-regulation of ATF-4 observed in this study also may reflect the stress-inducing effects of homocysteine, because ATF-4 mRNA is known to be induced by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration (21Tsujimoto A. Nyunoya H. Morita T. Sato T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by anoxia (34Estes S.D. Stoler D.L. Anderson G.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).We identified three previously uncharacterized genes whose mRNA levels were altered by homocysteine treatment and succeeded in isolating one almost full-length cDNA clone, pGC4-c. Its open reading frame encoded a novel polypeptide, termed RTP. Three-tandem repeats of GTRSRSHTSE in its C-terminal region was a novel motif. RTP did not have an apparent signal sequence, a transmembrane domain, or an ER-retention sequence. The amino acid sequence showed a 28% identity to ZK1073.1, a predicted protein of C. elegans (Fig. 4). In addition, Northern blot analysis showed the ubiquitous tissue distribution of RTP mRNA (Fig. 7). These two characteristics of RTP suggest that this protein might serve an essential, housekeeping function.We investigated the effects of various conditions on RTP mRNA expression. The expression was increased by not only homocysteine but also other sulfhydryl reagents, cysteine and 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 6A). The induction was also observed by treatment with tunicamycin. These observations in mRNA induction of RTP were quite similar to those of GRP78/BiP (Fig. 6B). This may relate to functional properties of RTP.Homocysteine treatment of HUVEC also increased NMDMC mRNA. Human NMDMC is a mitochondrial bifunctional enzyme that has activities of both 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (35Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pathway of homocysteine catabolism is either transsulfuration to form cystathionine catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase or remethylation to form methionine catalyzed by methyltransferase. Because the latter requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor, the increase of NMDMC mRNA would contribute to activation of the remethylation pathway. This speculation is supported by the previous reports of existence of the homocysteine-uptake system (36Ewadh M.J.A. Tudball N. Rose F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and homocysteine metabolic enzymes (37Wang J. Dudman N.P.B. Wilcken D.E.L. Lynch J.F. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 97: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in cultured EC. It would be a reasonable assumption that the same remethylation pathway would be activated in the cells of homocysteinemia patients.The major clinical manifestations of homocysteinemia include mental retardation, ectopia lentis, osteoporosis, skeletal abnormalities, fatty liver, and vascular disease. We suppose that such various symptoms are caused by the elevated concentration of intracellular, rather than extracellular (plasma), homocysteine in various cells and tissues of the body. Cell functions in homocysteinemia patients may be altered through the changes in gene expression identified in the present study because intracellular homocysteine levels would be much higher than normal. In fact, de Groot et al. (38de Groot P.G. Willems C. Boers G.H.J. Gonsalves M.D. van Aken W.G. van Mourik J.A. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 13: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) indicated that EC derived from homocysteinemia were more susceptible to sulfur-containing amino acids than normal EC, resulting in EC dysfunction.The present study indicates that cell injury by homocysteine leads to a stress condition probably caused by alteration of the intracellular redox potential and induces great changes in gene expression. Further investigations, including studies of novel gene transcripts such as RTP, are required to reveal the underlying mechanisms of homocysteine-induced cell injury, and the results may throw light on the pathophysiology of homocysteinemia. Recently, it has become clear that homocysteinemia is a major independent risk factor for vascular diseases (1Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Skovy F. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBzR) agonists (PK11195, FGIN 1-27, or chlorodiazepam), agents known to potentiate induction of the MPT, potentiated the cytotoxicity of TNF in the absence of ActD, an effect prevented by CyA plus ArA. The MPT was demonstrated independently of its effect on viability as the CyA-sensitive loss of rhodamine 123 fluorescence from cells preloaded with the dye. Treatment with TNF and ActD resulted in the loss of 80% of rhodamine fluorescence within 6 h, a time prior to any loss of viability. CyA plus ArA completely prevented this effect of TNF. Potentiation of the cytotoxicity of TNF by PBzR agonists was associated with induction of the MPT, as assessed by the loss of rhodamine fluorescence. CyA plus ArA completely prevented the loss of rhodamine 123. Ceramide replaced TNF in killing L929 fibroblasts, an effect also prevented by CyA plus ArA. Ceramide in the presence of ActD resulted in the loss of rhodamine fluorescence, an effect that was again prevented by CyA plus ArA. In addition, CyA plus ArA prevented the ability of PBzR agonists to potentiate the cytotoxicity of ceramide. In the presence of each PBzR agonist, ceramide caused the loss of rhodamine fluorescence, an effect completely prevented by CyA plus ArA. D609, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, completely prevented the killing by TNF, but not by ceramide, in the presence of ActD. D609 prevented induction of the MPT occurring with TNF, but not with ceramide. Inhibitors of endocytosis, as well as lysosomotropic amines, prevented the cytotoxicity of TNF, but not that of ceramide. It is concluded that the MPT is causally linked to the genesis of irreversible cell injury with TNF.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Known to induce physiologic effects in a variety of cells and tissues, TNF is also implicated in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, most notably septic shock. In addition, TNF kills cancer cells in intact animals and a variety of cell lines in vitro. Although attributed to both apoptosis and necrosis, the biochemical basis of the cytotoxic action of TNF is still largely unknown. The difficulty in unraveling the mechanism of cell killing lies in the fact that TNF activates many signaling molecules and second messengers, including phospholipases, kinases, phosphatases, oxygen radicals, and transcription factors (2Vandenabeele P. Dedercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). tumor necrosis factor α mitochondial permeability transition cyclosporin A Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium calcium-free/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone actinomycin D aristolochic acid peripheral benzodiazepine receptor phenylarsine oxide phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C diacylglycerol. The L929 line of mouse fibroblasts has been widely used to explore the mechanism of the cytotoxicity of TNF. In these cells, the signaling pathways initiated by TNF lead to a death that is better characterized as necrosis rather than apoptosis (3Matthews N. Br. J.

An alteration in mitochondrial structure and function with the resultant formation of reactive oxygen species seems to be an important step in the cytotoxic mechanism of TNF (5Grooten J. Goossens V.

Nevertheless, the specific nature of the mitochondrial alteration induced by TNF and how it relates, in turn, to the initial signal transduction events remain to be defined. The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is the regulatable opening of a large, nonspecific pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane (reviewed in Refs. 14Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J.

Although the molecular elements that form this pore have not been definitively established, they are presumed to derive from well known membrane constituents, including the adenine nucleotide translocator, porin molecules, and the complex forming the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (14Gunter T.E.

Similarly, CyA prevented the MPT observed in intact cells made anoxic or treated with rotenone (22Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C676-C685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In turn, CyA prevented the killing of hepatocytes by anoxia, rotenone, or cyanide (18Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Serroni A. Hoek J.B.

In the present study, we have utilized the L929 line of mouse fibroblasts to document that the MPT is an essential event in the pathogenesis of the lethal cell injury induced by TNF. In addition, we provide an account that ceramide is an important part of the signal transduction pathway by which TNF leads to induction of the MPT. The L929 line of mouse fibroblasts (ATCC-CCL-1, American Type Culture Collections) was maintained in 25-cm2 polystyrene flasks (Corning Costar Corp., Oneonta, NY) with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (high glucose; without pyruvate) (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and incubated under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. All experiments were performed 2 days after plating 1.0 × 105 cells in 500 μl of the above medium into 1.88 cm2 wells of a 24-well microtiter plate (Corning Costar). By the second day, the cells were growing exponentially and had achieved a density of 2.5-3.0 × 105 cells/well. Prior to treatment, fibroblasts were washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), after which 500 μl of DMEM without serum was added to the wells. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with one or more of the following chemicals. D609 (Biomol Inc.) and cyclosporin A (Sandoz, 50 mg/ml in cremophore) were dissolved in deionized, pyrogen-free water and added to wells in a 0.2% volume for a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and 5 μM, respectively; aristolochic acid (Biomol) was dissolved in PBS and added in a 0.2% volume for a final concentration 50 μM; rotenone, antimycin A, and colchicine (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to wells in a 0.5% volume for a final concentration of 25 μM, 50 μM, and 1 mM, respectively. Oligomycin and monensin (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO and added in a 0.2% volume for a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml and 10 μM, respectively. Ammonium chloride (Sigma) was dissolved in deionized pyrogen-free water and added in a 0.2% volume for a final concentration of 10 mM. Thirty minutes following treatment with the above chemicals, TNF ± ActD or ceramide ± ActD was added. TNF (Sigma; 22 units/ng) was dissolved in PBS and added to the wells in 0.2% volume at the final concentration indicated in the text. C2-ceramide or C2-dihydroceramide (Biomol) was dissolved in Me2SO and added in a 0.2% volume to give a final concentration of 6 μM. ActD (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO, further diluted in PBS, and added to wells in 0.2% volume to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Where indicated in the text, the cells were treated at the same time they were given either TNF or ceramide with one of the following peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBzR) agonists. PK11195, FGIN 1-27, and chlorodiazepam (Research Biochemical International) were dissolved in ethanol and added to the wells in a 0.2% volume for a final concentration of 10, 25, and 50 μM, respectively. Clonazepam (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and added in a 1% volume for a final concentration of 100 μM. Cell viability was determined at the times indicated in the text by the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium as described previously (23Glascott Jr., P.A. Gilfor E. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1155-1162PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability measured in this manner correlated closely with that determined by the uptake of propidium iodide or trypan blue (data not shown). The data from triplicate wells for each experimental point were averaged to obtain a single value for each point in each experiment. All experiments were repeated three times. Protein synthesis was determined by the incorporation of [3H]leucine into an acid-insoluble precipitate as described previously (24Mizumoto K. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 890-895PubMed Google Scholar). The MPT was demonstrated in intact cells as a CyA-sensitive loss of rhodamine 123 fluorescence. Cells in a 24-well microtiter plate were washed twice with PBS and returned to DMEM without serum. Rhodamine 123 from a 500 μM stock solution in water was added to give a final concentration of 5 μM. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h, then washed twice with PBS and placed in fresh DMEM without serum. The cells were treated as described in the text below, after which the medium was removed by aspiration and the cells washed again twice with PBS. Digitonin (Sigma) was dissolved in H2O and added in a 0.2% volume to give a final concentration of 7.5 μM. CCCP (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and added in a 0.2% volume to give a final concentration of 10 μM. Phenylarsene oxide (PhAsO) (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and added in a 0.2% volume to give a final concentration of 100 μM. The cells were covered with a solution of 0.05% trypsin in PBS. Following aspiration of the trypsin, the cells were collected in 500 μl of PBS, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min. Following aspiration of the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of PBS. The cell suspension was transferred to a quartz cuvette, and the fluorescence of cell-associated rhodamine 123 was read in a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter at 505 nm (excitation) and 534 nm (emission). Conditions for killing L929 fibroblasts by TNF are illustrated in Fig. 1. With these cells, the cytotoxicity of TNF does not depend on RNA or protein synthesis; rather, it is enhanced by inhibitors of transcription or translation (25Ruff M.R. Gifford G.E. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 380-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, doses of TNF from 0.1 to 1.5 ng/ml did not lethally injure the fibroblasts for at least 14 h (Fig. 1A). However, in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ActD, the same doses of TNF killed an increasing proportion of the fibroblasts. With 1.5 ng/ml TNF, almost 80% of the cells died within 14 h. The time course of the killing of L929 fibroblasts by 1 ng/ml TNF in the presence of ActD is shown in Fig. 1. Dead cells were first detected between 6 and 8 h, and their number increased steadily between 8 and 14 h. Cycloheximide (1 μM) similarly sensitized L929 fibroblasts to the cytotoxicity of TNF (data not shown). The cell killing by TNF (in the presence of ActD or cycloheximide) depends on induction of the MPT. Three different criteria were used to document the participation of the MPT in the cytotoxicity of TNF: 1) prevention of the cell killing by CyA, an inhibitor of the MPT; 2) potentiation of the cytotoxicity of TNF by peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonists, agents known to induce the MPT; and 3) measurement of the MPT in L929 cells treated with TNF. Inhibition by CyA of the MPT induced in isolated mitochondria de-energized by cyanide required the additional presence of a phospholipase A2 inhibitor (18Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Serroni A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13791-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, preservation by CyA of the viability of cultured hepatocytes treated with cyanide also required the presence of a phospholipase A2 inhibitor (18Pastorino J.G. Snyder J.W. Serroni A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13791-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, complete protection against the cell killing by TNF was obtained in the presence of CyA plus aristolochic acid, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor (26Vishwanth B.S. Fawzy A.A. Franson R.C. Inflammation. 1988; 12: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). CyA alone decreased the cytotoxicity of TNF by 45% and ArA alone by 35%. Other phospholipase inhibitors in combination with CyA also effectively prevented the cell killing by TNF (in the presence of ActD), including CDP-choline (27Arrigoni E. Averet N. Cohadon F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 3697-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), ON-RS-082 (28Banga H.S. Simons E.R. Brass L.F. Rittenhouse S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1989; 163: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The ability of CyA to prevent the cytotoxicity of TNF is not a consequence of the its binding to and, thus, inhibition of calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase. The immunosuppressive drug FK506 similarly inhibits calcineurin, but is inactive against the MPT (16Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). FK506 alone or in combination with a phospholipase A2 inhibitor was without effect on the cytotoxicity of TNF (Table I). In addition, cypermethrin, another potent inhibitor of calcineurin, was unable to prevent the cytotoxicity of TNF (Table I).Table IInability of FK506 and cypermethrin, inhibitors of calcineurin, to prevent the cytotoxicity of TNFTreatmentDead cells%TNF and ActD97 ± 14TNF and ActD + 1 μM FK506 and ArA98 ± 17TNF and ActD + 1 μM cypermethrin and ArA94 ± 8TNF and ActD + CyA and ArA8 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Participation of the MPT was also evident in the ability of PBzR agonists to potentiate the cytotoxicity of TNF. The PBzR is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (31Anholt R.R.H. Pedersen P.L. DeSouza E.B. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 576-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Basile A.S. Skolnick P.J. Neurochemistry. 1986; 46: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 33O'Beirne G.B.

Table II details the killing of L929 fibroblasts treated with TNF in the presence of PK11195, FGIN 1-27 (37Romeo E. Auta J. Kozikowski A.P. Ma D. Papadopoulos V. Fuia G. Costa E. Guidotti A. J.

Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2221-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this experiment, the cells were not treated with ActD. Whereas TNF alone was again not toxic, almost 90% of the cells died in the combined presence of PK11195 and TNF. CyA plus ArA prevented the cell killing in the presence of TNF and PK11195. Similarly, FGIN 1-27 and chlorodiazepam potentiated the cytotoxicity of TNF (Table II), effects prevented by CyA plus ArA. By contrast, the central benzodiazepine receptor agonist clonazepam was without effect (Table II).Table IIPotentiation of the cytotoxicity of TNF by peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonistsTreatmentDead cells%TNF alone4 ± 1TNF + 10 μM PK1119588 ± 15TNF + PK11195 + CyA and ArA5 ± 2TNF + 25 μM FGIN 1-2779 ± 5TNF + FGIN 1-27 + CyA and ArA9 ± 8TNF + 50 μM chlorodiazepam69 ± 5TNF + chlorodiazepam + CyA and ArA13 ± 7TNF + 100 μM clonazepam7 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Cycloheximide potentiates the cytotoxicity of TNF as a consequence of an inhibition of protein synthesis. However, the potentiation of the cytotoxicity of TNF by PBzR agonists is not a consequence of a similar inhibition of protein synthesis. Table III shows that neither PK11195, FGIN 1-27, nor chlorodiazepam had an effect on the rate of the incorporation of [3H]leucine into protein at either 6 or 18 h after treatment with each agent. By contrast, treatment of the cells with 0.5 μg/ml ActD resulted in a 90% inhibition of protein synthesis after 6 or 18 h.Table IIIInability of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonists to inhibit protein synthesis in L929 fibroblastsTreatment[3H]Leucine incorporation6 h18 h% of control10 μM PK1119594 ± 698 ± 725 μM FGIN 1-2797 ± 895 ± 950 μM chlorodiazepam100 ± 999 ± 130.5 μg/ml ActD8 ± 710 ± 9 Open table in a new tab An assay was developed to demonstrate the MPT in intact L929 fibroblasts independently of the effect of the transition on cell viability. The assay is based on the ability of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 to accumulate in the mitochondria as a consequence of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The MPT causes the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in the release of the accumulated rhodamine. PhAsO is a potent inducer of the permeability transition in isolated mitochondria (39Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intact cells, however, are impermeable to PhAsO, but respond to it following their permeabilization with digitonin. Fig. 3 shows that 7.5 μM digitonin had no effect on the rhodamine 123 fluorescence accumulated by cells preloaded with the dye. However, following permeabilization with digitonin, treatment with PhAsO resulted in the loss of 80% of the rhodamine fluorescence, an effect that was completely prevented by CyA (with or without ArA). Digitonin and CyA in the absence of PhAsO increased the fluorescence yield 25% compared with cells treated with digitonin alone. The basis for this increase is not known, but it may reflect inhibition by CyA of transient, physiological pore openings that reduce rhodamine retention. In any case, these data show that the CyA-inhibitable marked loss of rhodamine fluorescence can document the MPT under conditions where the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential is a consequence rather than a cause of the transition. Fig. 4 details the effect of TNF (in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ActD) on the fluorescence of rhodamine-labeled cells. Treatment with TNF resulted in the loss of 40% of the rhodamine fluorescence within 2 h and 80% within 6 h. CyA plus ArA completely prevented the TNF-induced loss at 2, 4, and 6 h. It deserves emphasis that there is no evident loss of viability prior to 8 h (Fig. 1). Thus, prevention of the loss of rhodamine fluorescence by CyA cannot be attributed to a nonspecific consequence of the preservation of cell viability. Fig. 4 also shows that treatment of the cells with CCCP, a proton ionophore that dissipates the mitochondrial membrane potential, similarly produced a time-dependent loss of rhodamine fluorescence from the cells. However, CyA (alone or plus ArA) had no effect on the rate or extent of the loss of rhodamine fluorescence. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn as to whether there is induction of the MPT with CCCP. In other words, the CyA-sensitive loss of rhodamine 123 fluorescence cannot be used to document the MPT under those conditions where the permeability transition is a consequence of the loss of the membrane potential. With either PhAsO or TNF plus ActD, however, the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the resultant loss of rhodamine 123 is clearly the consequence of the MPT. Potentiation of the cytotoxicity of TNF by PBzR agonists was associated with induction of the MPT. Fig. 5 shows that treatment of the fibroblasts with TNF and PK11195 (in the absence of ActD) resulted in the time-dependent loss of rhodamine fluorescence. Within 6 h, 90% of the dye had been lost from the cells. The presence of CyA plus ArA completely prevented the loss of rhodamine fluorescence at 2, 4, and 6 h. PK11195 alone had no effect on the rhodamine content of the cells. Interestingly, there was also no loss of rhodamine fluorescence in response to TNF alone (in the absence of ActD) (Fig. 5), a result indicating that the inhibition of transcription promoted the cytotoxicity of TNF at the level of the induction of the MPT. In other words, the induction of the MPT in response to TNF requires the inhibition of protein synthesis. In the presence of TNF (without ActD), the PBzR agonists FGIN 1-27 and chlorodiazepam also induced the MPT (Fig. 6). A time-dependent loss of rhodamine fluorescence, which was greater than 80% after 6 h, occurred with either FGIN 1-27 or chlorodiazepam in the presence of TNF, a result that parallels the ability of these two agonists to potentiate the cytotoxicity of TNF (Table II). Again, CyA plus ArA completely prevented the loss of rhodamine fluorescence (Fig. 6). There was no effect on the rhodamine content of the cells by either FGIN 1-27 or chlorodiazepam in the absence of TNF. The lipid ceramide has been implicated as a second messenger in various pathways of TNF signal transduction (40Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 41Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of ActD, 6 μM ceramide killed L929 fibroblasts (see Fig. 2). In the absence of ActD, this dose of ceramide was not toxic. An inactive analogue of ceramide, dihydroceramide, did not kill fibroblasts in the presence of ActD (9 ± 2% cells died over 18 h). The cell killing by ceramide depended on induction of the MPT, as assessed by the same criteria used in the case of TNF. CyA plus ArA prevented the cell killing by ceramide (see Fig. 2). Treatment with ceramide and ActD resulted in a time-dependent loss of rhodamine fluorescence from the fibroblasts (Fig. 7). More than 80% of the rhodamine was lost from the cells within 6 h. Again, CyA plus ArA completely prevented the loss of rhodamine fluorescence caused by ceramide and ActD (Fig. 7). PBzR agonists potentiated the cytotoxicity of ceramide. PK11195, FGIN 1-27, and chlorodiazepam potentiated the cytotoxicity of ceramide in the absence of ActD (Table IV). In each case, CyA plus ArA prevented the loss of viability with ceramide in the presence of a PBzR agonist (Table IV). Finally, with each PBzR agonist, ceramide caused the loss of rhodamine 123 fluorescence from the fibroblasts, an effect that was completely prevented by CyA plus ArA (Table IV).Table IV.Potentiation of ceramide cytotoxicity and induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition by benzodiazepine receptor agonistsTreatmentDead cells (18 h)Rhodamine retention (6 h)%% controlCeramide5 ± 1108 ± 15+ 10 μM PK1119582 ± 215 ± 8+ PK11195 + CyA and ArA8 ± 3119 ± 19+ 25 μM FGIN 1-2777 ± 818 ± 8+ FGIN + CyA and ArA15 ± 792 ± 7+ 50 μM chlorodiazepam71 ± 1016 ± 9+ Chlorodiazepam + CyA and ArA8 ± 6121 ± 16+ 100 μM clonazepam12 ± 5NDaNot determined.a Not determined. Open table in a new tab Ceramide is generated as a consequence of the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by either a neutral or an acidic sphingomyelinase (42Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In the case of the acidic sphingomyelinase, binding of TNF to its 55-kDa cell surface receptor activates a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, a plasma membrane enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to yield phosphorylcholine and 1,2-diacylglycerol (40Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 42Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Following binding of TNF to the cell surface receptor and the activation of PC-PLC, the receptor complex is internalized within an endosomal vesicle (45Bigda J. Beletsky I. Brakebusch C. Varfolomeev Y Engelmann H. Bigda J. Holtmann H. Wallach D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 445-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) by an energy-dependent mechanism, which also acidifies the vesicle (46Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated by DAG and in the acidic milieu required for optimal activity, acidic sphingomyelinase liberates ceramide (42Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 43Schutze S. Berkovic D. Tomsing O. Unger C. Kronke M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The xanthate D609 specifically inhibits PC-PLC (42Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 47Muller-Decker K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 shows that D609 completely prevents the killing of L929 fibroblasts by TNF in the presence of ActD. Whereas over 90% of the cells died within 18 h of exposure to TNF and ActD, only 15% of the cells died over the same time course in the presence of 50 μg/ml D609. By contrast, D609 did not prevent the cell killing by ceramide in the presence of ActD (Fig. 8). In the absence of ActD, ceramide and D609 were not toxic. D609 prevented the induction of the MPT in fibroblasts treated with TNF and ActD, as shown by the ability of D609 to prevent the loss of rhodamine fluorescence (Fig. 8). By contrast, D609 did not prevent the loss of rhodamine fluorescence that occurred in fibroblasts treated with ceramide and ActD. Finally, Fig. 8 indicates that ceramide alone (in the absence of ActD) did not induce the MPT, a result indicating that with ceramide, as with TNF, the effect of ActD is to promote the permeability transition. Importantly, CyA plus ArA still prevented both the loss of viability and the MPT in cells treated with ceramide and D609 (data not shown). In other words, D609 did not change the mechanism of cell killing by ceramide. Metabolic inhibitors that deplete the fibroblasts of ATP can interfere with receptor-mediated endocytosis, as well as prevent the acidification of endosomal vesicles. Accordingly, rotenone, oligomycin, or antimycin A substantially reduced the cytotoxicity of TNF (Table V). As receptor-mediated endocytosis also depends upon intact microtubules (46Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the depolymerization of microtubules by colchicine similarly prevented TNF-induced cell killing (Table V). Lysosomotropic agents such as ammonium chloride and monensin prevent endosomal acidification and protected against the cytotoxicity of TNF (Table V). Importantly, the cell killing by ceramide was not affected by rotenone, oligomycin, antimycin A, colchicine, monensin, or ammonium chloride (Table V).Table VPrevention of the cytotoxicity of TNF but not that of ceramide by inhibitors of endocytosis and lysosomotropic aminesTreatmentsDead cellsTNF + ActhCeramide + ActD%No additions88 ± 484 ± 425 μM rotenone24 ± 584 ± 10.1 μg/ml oligomycin28 ± 386 ± 450 μM antimycin A25 ± 685 ± 81 mM colchicine13 ± 585 ± 810 μM monensin21 ± 280 ± 710 mM ammonium chloride26 ± 682 ± 9 Open table in a new tab The data presented above document that the MPT is an essential feature of the mechanism of the cytotoxicity of TNF. Evidence from three different studies supports this conclusion. CyA plus ArA, which inhibits the MPT, prevented the cytotoxicity of TNF (Fig. 2). Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonists, agents that potentiate induction of the MPT, potentiated the cytotoxicity of TNF, an effect that was prevented by CyA plus ArA (Table II). Finally, the MPT in response to TNF was assessed in intact fibroblasts as the CyA-sensitive loss of rhodamine 123 fluorescence (Fig. 4). In all cases, TNF-induced cell death was correlated with MPT occurrence. Alternative explanations, other than an effect on the induction of the MPT for the protection afforded by CyA and the potentiation occurring with PBzR agonists, were ruled out. An interpretation of the protective effect of CyA as a consequence of an inhibition of calcineurin was excluded by the inability of two other inhibitors of this enzyme, FK506 and cypermethrin, to prevent the cell killing by TNF. Similarly, an interpretation of the potentiation by PBzR agonists as a consequence of the inhibition of protein synthesis was excluded by the inability of PBzR agonists to prevent the incorporation of [3H]leucine into protein. Thus, the data in this report provide compelling evidence that the MPT is causally linked to the genesis of irreversible injury with TNF in L929 fibroblasts. Whereas the specific mechanism whereby the MPT develops in response to TNF is not known, the data presented here suggest that the generation of ceramide plays a role. Ceramide replaced TNF in both inducing the MPT (Fig. 7) and in killing L929 fibroblasts (Fig. 2). As with TNF, the cytotoxicity of ceramide was potentiated by PBzR agonists (Table II) and prevented by CyA plus ArA (Fig. 2). Finally, the data presented here are consistent with the mechanism whereby ceramide is generated by the activation of an acidic syphingomyelinase by DAG, which was formed, in turn, as a result of activation of PC-PLC. An inhibitor of PC-PLC prevented the cytotoxicity of TNF, but not that of ceramide (Fig. 8). Inhibitors of either receptor-mediated endocytosis or endosomal acidification prevented the cytotoxicity of TNF, but again not that of ceramide (Table V). These data are consistent with the scenario whereby the binding of TNF to its 55-kDa surface receptor activates PC-PLC, with the resultant formation of DAG. After the TNF-receptor complexes are actively internalized within acidic endosomal vesicles, DAG activates acidic sphingomyelinase. As a consequence, sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed, releasing ceramide, an event that leads, in turn, to induction of the MPT. The mechanism of the cytotoxicity of TNF proposed here is consistent with previous observations utilizing L929 mouse fibroblasts. In particular, we confirm that mitochondrial inhibitors modulate the cytotoxicity of TNF (7Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our data imply that the mechanism whereby such agents act is different from that proposed previously (7Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rotenone, oligomycin, and antimycin A prevent the cell killing by TNF (Table V). By depleting the cells of ATP, these agents prevent receptor-mediated endocytosis and, thus, prevent the formation of ceramide, the metabolite responsible for promoting induction of the MPT. Importantly, the inability of these same inhibitors to prevent the cell killing by ceramide (Table I) argues that a perturbation of mitochondrial function that leads to the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates (7Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is not the primary mechanism of their protective effect. The alternative conclusion that ATP depletion is the relevant consequence of the action of these inhibitors also accounts for the recent observation that glutamine starvation protects against the cytotoxicity of TNF (48Goossens V. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 192-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In L929 fibroblasts, glutamine is the major energy source that drives ATP formation. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that oxidants are potent inducers of the MPT (25Ruff M.R. Gifford G.E. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 380-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and antioxidants protect against the cytotoxicity of TNF (10Zimmerman R.J. Chan A. Leadon S.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1644-1648PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yamaguchi N. Kuriyama H. Watanabe N. Neda H. Maeda M. Nitsu Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1671-1675PubMed Google Scholar, 12Matthew N. Neale M.L.

Cell. 1989; 58: 924-931Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains to be determined whether ceramide promotes the MPT by increasing the flux of activated oxygen species, or alternatively, whether such species form as a consequence of the MPT induced by ceramide by a mechanism unrelated to these reactive oxygen intermediates. Finally, it deserves emphasis that the cytotoxicity of ceramide, like that of TNF, depends on the presence of either ActD or cycloheximide. According to our hypothesis, ceramide acts to promote induction of the MPT, an event linked to the loss of cell viability by a mechanism that remains to be defined. The MPT does not occur with TNF or ceramide alone. Accordingly, the action of ActD or cycloheximide must be to modulate the induction of the MPT by ceramide. ActD or cycloheximide most likely prevents the synthesis of a protective protein constitutively present in L929 fibroblasts that turns over rapidly or of a protein that is induced by TNF. Clearly, the induction of such a protein by TNF would allow cells to react to this cytokine without loss of viability, and the loss of such a response could readily account for the sensitivity of cancer cells to the cytotoxicity of TNF."

The kinase activity (immunocomplex toward S6 peptide) of each isoform was activated by in vivo growth factor (epidermal growth factor (EGF)) stimulation; RSK1 was more responsive (10-15-fold) versus RSK2 and RSK3 (2-4-fold). Pretreatment with PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor) partially (80%) blocked EGF-mediated ERK1 activation and had similar effects on EGF stimulation of each ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK).

A specific association between mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (ERK1 and ERK2) and RSK isoforms was tested by MAPK immunoblotting after immunoprecipitation of RSKs. ERK1 and ERK2 were present in RSK3 (and to a lesser extent, RSK2) immunoprecipitates, but were absent in RSK1 immunoprecipitates. Both dephosphorylated (from quiescent cells) and phosphorylated (from stimulated cells) MAPKs were associated with RSK2 and RSK3. Deletion mutants of RSK3 were characterized: the C terminus (33 residues) was shown to be required for association with MAPKs. The kinase activity of RSK1 or RSK2 was enhanced by in vitro incubation with ERK1. In contrast, RSK3 activity was not affected by exposure to ERK1. Furthermore, MAPKs in RSK3 immunoprecipitates were phosphorylated by purified MEK1; however, RSK3 kinase activity was unaffected. We conclude that 1) the MEK1-MAPK signaling pathway is both necessary and sufficient for in vivo growth factor-mediated activation of all three RSK isoforms; 2) RSK isoforms differ with respect to growth factor responsiveness and their physical association with MAPK; and 3) formation of the MAPK·RSK complex is mediated by the RSK C terminus.

Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids have no effect on the transcription of these genes.Liver and adipose tissue are the two major tissues involved in lipid biosynthesis. Although the regulation of lipogenic gene expression by PUFAs in liver is currently being studied, the effects of these molecules on gene expression in mature, fully differentiated adipocytes have not been extensively investigated. In view of the potential role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in regulating total fatty acid synthesis and the role stearoyl-CoA desaturase plays in this process, we examined the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the expression of the scd1 gene in mature adipocytes. Our results suggest that PUFAs regulate the expression of the adipocyte scd1 gene by regulating stability of mRNA transcripts.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have demonstrated that exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to 300 μM arachidonic acid results in a decrease in Scd enzyme activity as well as scd1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). As much as a 60% decrease in enzyme activity was observed, whereas mRNA levels were repressed by 80% of the original level. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with AA also caused a 3-fold decrease in the half-life of scd1 mRNA (Fig. 5) and no apparent decrease in scd1 gene transcription. The pretranslational regulation of scd1 gene expression by PUFAs seems, then, to result primarily from the decrease of mRNA stability. Furthermore, the repression was independent of AA metabolism to eicosanoids because cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and epoxygenase inhibitors did not abolish the effect (Fig. 6). Other polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic, linolenic, and eicosapentaeinoic acids, also decreased the scd1 mRNA levels when added exogenously to mature adipocytes. By contrast, oleic acid (Fig. 7) and stearic acid did not decrease scd1 mRNA levels; therefore, this response is unique to polyunsaturated fatty acids.Stearoyl-CoA desaturase gene expression has previously been shown to be repressed by polyunsaturated fatty acids in liver tissue principally at the level of gene transcription (29Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10925-10930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Landschulz K.T. Jump D.B. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Until now, the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on scd1 gene expression in adipose tissue had not been studied. The rate of transcription from the scd1 gene was not dramatically affected in this adipocyte system. Although transcriptional regulation can not be completely ruled out by these experiments, changes in transcription that are below detectable levels suggest that transcriptional regulation does not play a significant role in PUFA suppression of adipocyte scd1 gene expression. Our results also suggest that posttranslational regulation is not a major factor in AA-mediated scd1 repression. The observed reduction in enzyme activity (60%) could be completely accounted for by decreases in scd1 mRNA levels (80%). Thus, there seems to be no additional down-regulation occurring posttranslationally. As opposed to hepatocytes, changes in mRNA stability are the major determinant of scd1 mRNA abundance in adipocytes.Destabilization of mRNA encoding the predominantly expressed form of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in adipocytes may be regulated through mRNA sequences in the 3′ untranslated region. Both the mouse and rat scd1 cDNAs contain an unusually long 3′ untranslated region (14Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Theide M.A. Ozols J. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13230-13235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of such a long 3′-noncoding stretch is currently unknown, though it contains several structural motifs (AUUUA) characteristic of mRNA destabilization sequences (42Long S.D. Pekala P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Marzulff W.F. Genes Exp. 1992; 2: 93-97PubMed Google Scholar). Four of these sequences are clustered close to the 3′ end of the coding region (Fig. 8). Because these AU-rich elements play active roles in the selective degradation of several mRNAs in response to various factors, these sequences could be possible targets of PUFA effects on scd1 mRNA (44Alberta J.A. Rundell K. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4532-4538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Shyu A. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E.

Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar). For example, Pekala and Long (42Long S.D. Pekala P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have suggested that such a motif in the GLUT4 gene expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes may confer destabilization of mRNA in response to tumor necrosis factor α treatment. With such generalized effects of AU-rich elements, it is possible to speculate that this motif plays a role in the adipocyte regulation of desaturase gene expression by regulating mRNA stability in response to PUFAs. Additional mapping studies would be necessary to identify whether the AU-rich elements in the scd1 3′ untranslated region are involved in this destabilization.The nature of the PUFA metabolite that mediates the observed mRNA destabilization is currently unknown. As demonstrated in the present study, inhibiting eicosanoid synthesis (Fig. 6) did not prevent the PUFA suppression of scd1 gene expression. Consistent with other studies on PUFA-regulated genes (25Clarke S.D. Armstrong M.K. Jump D.B. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Annu.

Furthermore, the desaturase gene is regulated by a range of polyunsaturated acids and not by mono- or unsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 7), suggesting that repression is PUFA-specific.The data presented here suggest that PUFAs regulate scd1 gene expression through different mechanisms in different tissue types, the reasons for which are not yet understood. However, scd1 provides a good model to study the effects of PUFAs on mRNA stability. The ongoing search, in our lab and others, for possible protein mediators that destabilize scd1 mRNA may provide further definition to the molecular basis of PUFA regulation of lipogenic gene expression.

Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids have no effect on the transcription of these genes.Liver and adipose tissue are the two major tissues involved in lipid biosynthesis. Although the regulation of lipogenic gene expression by PUFAs in liver is currently being studied, the effects of these molecules on gene expression in mature, fully differentiated adipocytes have not been extensively investigated. In view of the potential role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in regulating total fatty acid synthesis and the role stearoyl-CoA desaturase plays in this process, we examined the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the expression of the scd1 gene in mature adipocytes. Our results suggest that PUFAs regulate the expression of the adipocyte scd1 gene by regulating stability of mRNA transcripts."

TGF-β also stimulates extracellular matrix production both by increasing the rate of synthesis of extracellular matrix components like fibronectin, collagen I, and biglycan, and by down-regulating the overall proteolytic activity. Three isoforms of TGF-β, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, have been identified in mammals. These isoforms have similar, but distinct, activities and are differently distributed among tissues. Translation of TGF-β mRNA results in the formation of a 105-kDa dimeric proform, which is proteolytically cleaved in the Golgi apparatus to mature TGF-β (4Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Upon secretion, the mature growth factor (m = 25 kDa), remains noncovalently associated with the propeptide (also known as latency-associated peptide or LAP, m = 80 kDa), thus forming an inactive, latent precursor or small latent complex. In order to interact with specific cell surface serine/threonine kinase receptors, TGF-β must dissociate from LAP, a process known as TGF-β activation.

In most cell types and tissues, the small latent complex is disulfide-linked during secretion to a 160-240-kDa glycoprotein called the latent TGF-β binding protein (LTBP). This complex is known as the large latent complex. Three LTBP family members have been described, LTBP-1, LTBP-2, and LTBP-3, which have been cloned respectively from human and rat (5Kanzaki T.

The first member to be identified, LTBP-1, was shown to be important for assembly and secretion of small latent TGF-β in human erythroleukemic cells (10Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). After secretion, LTBP-1 can also mediate the association of the latent TGF-β complex to the extracellular matrix (11Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of LTBP-1 pre-mRNA results in two forms of the protein, LTBP-1S and LTBP-1L (12Olofsson A. Ichijo H.

LTBP-1L includes LTBP-1S plus an N-terminal extension that confers higher affinity for the extracellular matrix. The large latent complex formed by the association of LTBP and small latent TGF-β is released in vitro from the extracellular matrix upon treatment with proteases, such as the serine proteases plasmin, mast cell chymase, and leukocyte elastase, through partial cleavage of LTBP-1 (11Taipale J.

Although the release of the large latent complex from the extracellular matrix mediated by cells has not been reported, this step is assumed to play a role in latent TGF-β activation by allowing interaction of the complex with the cell surface (14Flaumenhaft R. Abe M. Sato Y. Miyazono K. Harpel J. Heldin C.H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Large latent complex activation in cocultures of endothelial and smooth muscle cells or in lipopolysaccharide-activated peritoneal macrophages is inhibited by an excess of LTBP-1 or by anti-LTBP-1 antibodies, suggesting a direct role for LTBP-1 in this process (14Flaumenhaft R.

LTBP primary structure displays multiple tandem calcium binding EGF-like repeats and characteristic eight-cysteine repeats, also called “LTBP-like” repeats. It has been recently shown that LTBP-1 is a component of microfibrils in osteoblast extracellular matrix, independent of its association with latent TGF-β (16Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Indeed, LTBPs share extensive structural homology with the extracellular matrix proteins fibrillin-1 and −2 found in the elastic fibers (17Maslen C.L. Corson G.M. Maddox B.K. Glanville R.W. Sakai L.Y. Nature. 1991; 352: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18Lee B. Godfrey M. Vitale E. Hori H. Mattei M.G. Sarfarazi M. Tsipouras P. Ramirez F. Hollister D.W.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This homology includes multiple EGF-like domains and eight-cysteine repeats, which are unique to LTBP and fibrillins. However, small latent TGF-β was not shown to form a complex with fibrillins, raising the question of the specificity of LTBP interaction with the small latent complex. To identify LTBP domains involved in the association with latent TGF-β, we have designed deletion mutants of human LTBP-1S and coexpressed them with human latent TGF-β1 in insect Sf9 cells using recombinant baculoviruses, a system suitable for observing the formation of the large latent complex. Our results show that the third eight-cysteine repeat is necessary and sufficient for association to the TGF-β1 precursor. Mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant eight-cysteine repeat-3 shows that, when produced in Sf9 cells, this domain contains no post-translational modification other than an N-linked hybrid oligosaccharide. Sf9 cells were maintained in Hink's TNM-FH supplemented Grace's medium (JRH Biosciences) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biomed), 0.1% Pluronic (Life Technologies, Inc.), 292 μg/ml glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The dual promoter transfer vector pAcUW51 (Pharmingen), which bears the polyhedrin promoter and the p10 promoter, was used to generate recombinant viruses encoding both TGF-β1 and constructs derived from LTBP-1S. To achieve secretion of LTBP-1S mutants deleted at the N terminus, a modified version of pAcUW51, named pAcUGP, was constructed by substituting the XbaI-BamHI fragment of pAcUW51, which contains the polyhedrin promoter, with the EcoRV-BglII fragment of pAcGP67-A (Pharmingen), in which the polyhedrin promoter is followed by the baculoviral protein GP67 signal sequence and a polylinker. To produce secreted peptide tagged with a six-histidine motif, a cassette encoding six histidines was retrieved from vector pAcSG-His-NT C (Pharmingen) and subcloned into pAcGP67 downstream of the GP67 signal sequence, which resulted in vector pAcGP67-His. All the following constructs were checked by automated sequencing. The fragment 68-4543 (DraI-DraI) of the human LTBP-1S cDNA (clone BPA13, kindly provided by Dr. Kohei Miyazono) (5Kanzaki T.

LTBP-1S mutants were derived from the BPA13 DraI-DraI fragment and placed under the control of the polyhedrin promoter in pAcUW51 or pAcUGP. All subsequent numbering refers to LTBP-1S coding sequence. ΔC1180 and ΔC1014 were obtained by introduction of stop codons after the respective restriction sites Bst1107 I (position 3536) and DpnI (position 3037). ΔN273 and ΔN441 were obtained by digestion of BPA13 with HpaI and DraI, and ScaI and DraI respectively, and insertion of these fragments into pAcUGP in frame with GP67 signal sequence. Deletion of fragment 3539-3782 in the LTBP-1S coding sequence using flanking restriction sites Bst1107I and NaeI resulted in mutant ΔCR4. To construct ΔCR3, the region 3264-4194 was amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and BPA13 as a template with primers AATCTCGCGATGAAGCTGGTGGTGAGAAC and GATTCTGTTTCACTCCAGGTC. The NruI site introduced in the forward primer was used to fuse this fragment to the 3′-end of LTBP-1S cDNA digested with BsaBI (position 3031). The same fragment was also retrieved by PCR using GCTCTAGATGAAGCTGGTGGTGAGAAC as a forward primer and subcloned into pAcUGP in frame with GP67 signal sequence to generate ΔN1088. The region 3028-3271, which encodes the eight-cysteine repeat-3, was amplified by PCR with primers AAGGCCTGTAGATGTAGATCAACCCAAAG and GCTCTAGACAGCTTCAGAAGATGATTCTC, which adds a stop codon (TAG) at the 3′-end. Fusion of this PCR product to the GP67 signal sequence in pAcUGP using the StuI site introduced in the forward primer resulted in construct CR3. Also, ligation of this fragment to ΔN441 using BsaBI led to mutants ΔN441CR3. Last, ΔN1009 was obtained by fusing construct CR3 to the 3′-end of LTBP-1S cDNA through the unique AlwNI site. The sequence encoding human TGF-β1 was excised from the vector pRK5-β1E (a gift from Dr. Rik Derynck) (20Arrick B.A. Lopez A.R. Elfman F. Ebner R. Damsky C.H. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and BglII and placed under the control of the p10 promoter in pAcUW51 and pAcUGP in addition to LTBP-1S wild-type or truncated forms. LTBP-1S and TGF-β1 cDNAs were also subcloned individually into pVL1392 (Pharmingen) for separate expression. To generate HisCR3, the PCR fragment encoding the third eight-cysteine repeat (see above) was introduced into pAcGP67-His. All constructs were used to generate recombinant viruses with linearized AcNPV DNA using the BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were infected with the appropriate virus, medium was changed 4 h post-infection for serum-free 401 medium (JRH Biosciences), and conditioned media were harvested 72 h post-infection for analysis. In the case of HisCR3, coexpression with small latent TGF-β1 was achieved by coinfecting Sf9 cells with the recombinant viruses encoding HisCR3 and small latent TGF-β1. LTBP-1S was detected with the polyclonal rabbit sera Ab 39 obtained using LTBP-1 purified from platelets as immunogen (10Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody directed against recombinant human β1-LAP from Chinese hamster ovary cells (mAb VB3A9) was used to reveal TGF-β1 precursor. Complexes between the small latent TGF-β1 and LTBP-1S mutants in Sf9 cell conditioned media were immunodetected on Western blot using Ab 39 (1/5,000) or mAb VB3A9 (0.6 μg/ml) and the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.). Immunoreactive bands were revealed by processing for chemiluminescence with the Boehringer Mannheim chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The complex of histidine-tagged peptide HisCR3 with small latent TGF-β1 was isolated using TALON chelating resin, as described below for the purification of recombinant peptide HisCR3, and blotted after SDS-PAGE with mAb VB3A9. Conditioned media were assayed for TGF-β activity on mink lung epithelial cells stably transfected with the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter, a TGF-β responsive promoter, as described previously (21Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells (2 × 107 cells/15-cm dish) were infected with the recombinant baculovirus encoding the peptide HisCR3. Medium was changed to 401 serum-free medium 4 h post-infection. At day 3 post-infection, conditioned medium was harvested and dialyzed against 40 volumes of 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4 (25°C) for 24 h at 4°C. Two ml of TALON metal-chelating resin slurry (Clontech) were added to 50 ml of dialyzed conditioned medium and incubated at room temperature for 1 h on a rotating shaker. After three washes with 20 ml of dialysis buffer (one brief, 2 × 10 min), the resin was poured in a column, and the peptide was eluted with 100 mM imidazole in dialysis buffer. Deglycosylation was performed by incubating 3 μg of peptide HisCR3 with 0.5 unit of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 16 h at 37°C. Protein and peptide samples were prepared for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry using the dried droplet method (22Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 1193A-1203ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The matrix used was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma), which was purified by recrystallization. To produce the dried droplets, a saturated solution of matrix was prepared in 2:1 aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile at room temperature. The sample was added to this solution so that the final sample concentration was 1-10 μM. One-half microliter of the solution was placed on the mass spectrometer's probe and allowed to dry. The sample was then analyzed. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding either human LTBP-1S or human small latent TGF-β1 were generated for expression in insect cells (Sf9). Sf9 cells infected with the virus encoding LTBP-1S secreted a homogenous product with an estimated molecular mass of 195 kDa under nonreducing conditions as revealed by immunoblotting of the conditioned medium (Fig. 1, lane 1). Under reducing conditions, the protein migrated at the same position as the 205-kDa marker (not shown) as reported for LTBP-1S from human foreskin fibroblasts (5Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Moren A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Sf9-produced LTBP-1S bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose with high affinity, indicating that it was glycosylated (not shown). Analysis of the conditioned medium of cells infected with the virus encoding small latent TGF-β1 using an anti-β1-LAP monoclonal antibody revealed two major bands of 80 and 105 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1, lane 3), corresponding to LAP dimer and unprocessed TGF-β1 precursor. Minor bands, which might correspond to different glycosylation isoforms, were also detected. Two bands of 40 and 53 kDa were seen after reduction of the samples (not shown). These bands correspond to the molecular weights of LAP monomer and uncleaved LAP-TGF-β1 monomer respectively, suggesting that the cleavage of the pro-TGF-β1 into LAP and mature TGF-β1 was incomplete in Sf9 cells. Similar observations were previously described using mammalian cells overexpressing latent TGF-β1 (4Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Monomeric pro-TGF-β1 was detectable in Sf9 cell-conditioned medium, probably as a result of high expression level (not shown). In vitro activation of latent TGF-β1 by heating of the conditioned medium at 80°C for 10 min yielded 10-20 ng/ml active TGF-β1, indicating that functional, mature TGF-β1 was produced. Only 1-2% of the mature TGF-β1 was present in the medium as an active form as measured without prior heat activation. Using a dual promoter transfer vector, we generated a recombinant baculovirus encoding both LTBP-1S and latent TGF-β1 to observe the formation of large latent TGF-β1 complex. When insect cells were infected with this virus, a high molecular mass complex (estimated molecular mass 260-290 kDa) was detected with both anti-LTBP-1 and anti-β1-LAP antibodies by Western blotting under nonreducing conditions, indicating that Sf9 cells assembled the large latent complex (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4). LTBP-1S and latent TGF-β1 were also detected as free forms. The high molecular mass complex often appeared as two bands, consistent with the inclusion of both processed and unprocessed pro-TGF-β1 in the complex. Secretion of the complex was efficient as more than 90% of the immunoreactive material was recovered in the extracellular medium. In contrast to what was reported previously in human erythroleukemia cells (10Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), coexpression of latent TGF-β1 with LTBP-1 did not change significantly the rate of latent TGF-β1 secretion (not shown). The baculovirus expression system was next used to identify the region of LTBP-1S responsible for its disulfide bonding to LAP. Each LAP monomer has three cysteines. Two of these are involved in interchain disulfide bonds in LAP dimer, whereas the third (Cys33) is available for bonding with LTBP-1 (23Brunner A.M. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LTBP-1S contains 139 cysteines, 10% of the total number of amino acids (5Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Moren A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Each EGF-like repeat has six cysteines, which form three intramolecular disulfide bridges and are unlikely to be engaged in an intermolecular bond with LAP. The remaining cysteines in LTBP-1S are located in the N-terminal region at positions 35, 39, 44, 48, and 298, and in the four eight-cysteine domains. To determine the region containing the interchain disulfide bonds, deletion mutants of LTBP-1S were constructed (Fig. 2) and coexpressed with latent TGF-β1 in Sf9 cells as described for the wild-type protein. For each mutant, the conditioned medium was immunoblotted with anti-LTBP 1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-9) and anti-β1-LAP (Fig. 3A, lanes 10-21) antibodies. Deletion of the N-terminal region including the eight-cysteine repeat-1 and −2 did not prevent the formation of a complex with latent TGF-β (mutants ΔN293, lanes 3 and 12, and ΔN441, lanes 4 and 13). A mutant LTBP-1S missing the C-terminal sequence including the eight-cysteine repeat-4 (mutant ΔC1180, lanes 5 and 14) still associated covalently with latent TGF-β1. However, when the C-terminal deletion was extended to include the eight-cysteine repeat-3 (mutant ΔC1014, lanes 6 and 15), no high molecular weight complex was detected, suggesting that the eight-cysteine repeat-3 was involved in bonding to LAP. To further assess this hypothesis, cDNAs encoding LTBP-1S mutants lacking either the eight-cysteine repeat-3 alone (ΔCR3) or the eight-cysteine repeat-4 alone (ΔCR4) were constructed. When expressed in Sf9 cells, ΔCR4 formed a complex with latent TGF-β1 (lanes 8 and 17), whereas ΔCR3 did not (lanes 7 and 16). Conversely, a mutant deleted at the N and the C termini (ΔN441CR3), in which all of the eight-cysteine repeats except the eight-cysteine repeat-3 were omitted, associated with latent TGF-β1 (lanes 9 and 18). Formation of a complex with latent TGF-β1 was also observed when the C-terminal portion of LTBP-1 was expressed, provided that the sequence included the eight-cysteine repeat-3 (mutants ΔN1009 and ΔN1088, lanes 19 and 20). The complex of small latent TGF-β1 with LTBP-1 mutant ΔN1009 was detected with anti-β1-LAP mAb VB3A9, but not with anti-LTBP-1 Ab 39 (not shown). Finally, the eight-cysteine repeat-3 (CR3) was expressed together with small latent TGF-β1. Western blot analysis of the conditioned medium with anti-β1-LAP antibodies revealed a complex migrating above latent TGF-β1 (lane 21). When the eight-cysteine repeat-3 was fused to a six-histidine tag (HisCR3) and coexpressed with small latent TGF-β1, the complex (but not the small latent TGF-β1 alone) was retained on a metal-chelating resin (Fig. 3B), confirming that the eight-cysteine repeat-3 associated covalently with latent TGF-β1. Mixing of cells expressing separately the HisCR3 peptide and small latent TGF-β1 did not result in complex formation, indicating that coexpression of the two molecules was necessary for their association (not shown). Bonding of small latent TGF-β1 to the eight-cysteine repeat-3 appeared to be more efficient than to full-length LTBP-1S (Fig. 3A); the same phenomenon was also reproducibly observed with constructs ΔN293 and ΔN441, which may be explained by higher expression levels of these mutants as compared to wild-type LTBP-1S. These results show that the eight-cysteine repeat-3 is necessary and sufficient for association of LTBP-1 to latent TGF-β1.Fig. 3Mapping of LTBP-1S domain mediating bonding with small latent complex. Conditioned media of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus bearing both small latent TGF-β1 (SL TGF-β1) cDNA and one of LTBP-1S cDNA mutants were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7% gel) under nonreducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-LTBP-1 serum Ab 39 (lanes 1-9) and anti-β1-LAP mAb VB3A9 (lanes 10-21). In B, Sf9 cells were coinfected with two recombinant baculoviruses, one encoding small latent TGF-β1 and the other histidine-tagged peptide HisCR3; the presence of a complex between the two proteins in the conditioned medium was assessed by precipitation with metal-chelating resin followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with mAb VB3A9. The higher immunoreactive band might correspond to the association of the HisCR3 peptide with the small latent complex in a 2:1 ratio, as a result of artifactual disulfide bond exchange on the surface of the chelating resin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the eight-cysteine repeat-3, Sf9 cells were infected with the baculovirus encoding the eight-cysteine repeat-3 fused to a six-histidine motif HisCR3 (see sequence in Fig. 4A) and the recombinant peptide was purified by metal-affinity chromatography. The purified peptide, whose predicted molecular mass is 12,237 Da after processing of the signal-sequence, migrated on SDS-PAGE with an estimated molecular mass of 20-21 kDa (Fig. 4B). As the eight-cysteine repeat-3 in LTBP-1S contains Asn1039 (Asn101 in HisCR3, Fig. 4A) in the proper context for N-glycosylation (N/X/S or T), we treated the purified peptide with N-glycosidase F to determine whether N-glycosylation accounted for the distortion in electrophoretic mobility. However, this treatment resulted in a slightly slower migration on SDS-PAGE with an estimated molecular mass of 21-22 kDa (Fig. 4B). To assess further the presence of post-translational modifications, the peptide was subjected to mass spectrometry. Analysis of the native peptide (Fig. 5A) revealed two major molecular species with molecular masses of 13,266 Da (peak A) and 13,345 Da (peak B), respectively. Treatment with N-glycosidase F decreased the mass of these molecular ions, confirming that the peptide is N-glycosylated (Fig. 5B). This spectrum showed two peaks, one at 12,230 Da (peak A1), which is equal to the predicted molecular mass of the peptide, and one at 12,309 Da (peak B1), indicating the presence of a 79-Da post-translational modification resistant to N-glycosidase F. The 1,036-Da difference between peaks A and A1 or peaks B and B1 is compatible with the linkage of a truncated high mannose oligosaccharide Man3GlcNAc2 linked to a fucose residue. To enhance visualization of the glycosylation pattern, the glycosylated peptide was digested with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 5C). Peaks I (9,011 Da) and II (9,198 Da) correspond to the nonglycosylated forms of fragments 65-138 and 65-140, respectively, whereas the same fragments with an additional fucosylated Man3GlcNAc2 are found in peaks IV and VI. The nonfucosylated forms of the glycosylated fragments are also detected (peaks III and V). However, the 79-Da modification was not detected on these peptides. Analysis of the proteolytic fragments obtained with trypsin or V8 protease demonstrated that the 79-Da shift in peak B1 was due to an undetermined post-translational modification located in the linker of the histidine tag outside of the eight-cysteine repeat (not shown). Therefore, N-glycosylation is the only post-translational modification of the eight-cysteine repeat-3 produced in Sf9 cells.Fig. 5Analysis of peptide HisCR3 by mass spectrometry. Shown are molecular ion regions of mass spectra taken of the following peptide samples: A, HisCR3; B, HisCR3 after treatment with N-glycosidase F; C, HisCR3 after partial digestion with trypsin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to assess the presence of reduced cysteines in the HisCR3 peptide, alkylation under denaturing conditions was performed using vinyl pyridine and the peptide was analyzed by mass spectrometry. No mass shift was observed, suggesting that the eight cysteines were involved in intramolecular bonds. The experiments presented here demonstrate that LTBP-1S associates covalently to TGF-β1 through the third eight-cysteine repeat. During the preparation of this manuscript, a study reaching a similar conclusion about the role of the eight-cysteine repeat-3 in the covalent association of LTBP-1S to TGF-β1 in mammalian cells was published by Saharinen et al. (24Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). No other function has been described for this type of repeat, which is found in LTBPs and fibrillin-1 and −2. However, fibrillins do not covalently bind TGF-β, and within LTBP-1, association with TGF-β seems characteristic of the third eight-cysteine repeat. Mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant LTBP-1 eight-cysteine repeat-3 produced in insect cells showed that it is N-glycosylated. The N-linked glycosidic residue in these cells appears to be mainly a truncated hybrid sugar (Man3GlcNAc2) with occasional addition of a fucose residue. The Man3GlcNAc2 pentasaccharide has been described as a common N-linked oligosaccharide in lepidopteran cells (25Davidson D.J. Fraser M.J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5584-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Davidson D.J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but is rarely found in proteins synthesized by vertebrate cells. The presence in lepidopteran cells of a fucosyltransferase that can add a fucose residue to the asparagine-linked GlcNAc residue also has been established (27Staudacher E. Kubelka V. Marz L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Among the three LTBPs, the third eight-cysteine repeat is the only one to contain an N-glycosylation site. Glycosylation could change the conformation of this domain and favor its association with LAP. However, fibrillin-1 and −2 contain several eight-cysteine domains with putative N-glycosylation sites and were not shown to date to associate with small latent TGF-β, suggesting that N-glycosylation of the eight-cysteine repeat-3 is not the sole feature for association with small latent TGF-β. Indeed, our results show that LTBP-1S eight-cysteine repeat-3 associates with small latent TGF-β1 even when the N-linked glycosidic residue is a trimmed pentasaccharide. Accordingly, as reported by Saharinen et al. (24Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), point-mutagenesis of Asn1039 in the eight-cysteine repeat-3 to Ala does not prevent the association process in mammalian cells. Mass spectrometry characterization of the eight-cysteine repeat-3 shows unambiguously that no other post-translational modification of this domain is needed for bonding to TGF-β1. This conclusion is in contrast with that of Saharinen et al. (24Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), who speculated that other post-translational modifications, such as O-glycosylation, might play a role in the association process. This was based on their observation of the anomalous electrophoretic mobility of N-glycosidase F treated peptides that contained the eight-cysteine repeat-3, which seemed to indicate that N-glycosylation was not the only post-translational modification. From the data presented here, the retarded migration of the eight-cysteine repeat-3 on SDS-PAGE appears to be an intrinsic property of this peptide, which may be related to its conformation. Because insect cells are unable to perform some of the post-translational modifications found in mammals, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional post-translational modifications of this domain occur in mammalian cells. However, such modifications are not necessary for the ability of the eight-cysteine repeat-3 to associate with TGF-β. The absence of free cysteines in the recombinant HisCR3 peptide suggests that the eight-cysteine repeat-3 adopts an alternative structure for intermolecular bonding with the small latent complex. Remarkably, this domain binds to LAP out of the context of LTBP-1, suggesting the specific recognition of the small latent complex by the eight-cysteine repeat-3. This recognition mechanism may be essential for the formation of the large latent complex. For example, an initial noncovalent interaction of the eight-cysteine repeat-3 with small latent TGF-β could induce a conformational change in the eight-cysteine repeat-3 that would, in turn, favor disulfide bond exchange. Alternatively, this recognition step might occur between partially folded intermediates of LTBP and the TGF-β precursor at an early step during secretion, yielding formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. The idea of an interaction between LTBP and the TGF-β precursor early in the secretion pathway is supported by the role of LTBP in the assembly and the processing of small latent TGF-β (10Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. John Munger for critical review of this manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2010063697,"Glycosylation of endogenous secondary plant products and abiotic substances such as herbicides increases their water solubility and enables vacuolar deposition of these potentially toxic substances. We characterized and compared the transport mechanisms of two glucosides, isovitexin, a native barley flavonoid C-glucoside and hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside, a herbicide glucoside, into barley vacuoles. Uptake of isovitexin is saturable (Km = 82 μM) and stimulated by MgATP 1.3-1.5-fold. ATP-dependent uptake was inhibited by bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase, but not by vanadate. Transport of isovitexin is strongly inhibited after dissipation of the ΔpH or the ΔΨ across the vacuolar membrane. Uptake experiments with the heterologue flavonoid orientin and competition experiments with other phenolic compounds suggest that transport of flavonoid glucosides into barley vacuoles is specific for apigenin derivatives. In contrast, transport of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside is strongly stimulated by MgATP (2.5-3 fold), not sensitive toward bafilomycin, and much less sensitive to dissipation of the ΔpH, but strongly inhibited by vanadate. Uptake of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside is also stimulated by MgGTP or MgUTP by about 2-fold. Transport of both substrates is not stimulated by ATP or Mg2+ alone, ADP, or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. Our results suggest that different uptake mechanisms exist in the vacuolar membrane, a ΔpH-dependent uptake mechanism for specific endogenous flavonoid-glucosides, and a directly energized mechanism for abiotic glucosides, which appears to be the main transport system for these substrates. The herbicide glucoside may therefore be transported by an additional member of the ABC transporters.

In plants, secondary products such as species-specific phenolics as well as foreign compounds are often glycosylated in order to increase their water solubility. Storage of these compounds within the large central vacuole, a compartment with a very low metabolic activity, is generally assumed to protect the plant cell against potentially toxic effects of these substances, especially of their non-glycosidic form. Corresponding processes exist for the excretion of toxic conjugates in animals, e.g. at the canalicular membrane of liver hepatocytes (1Nishida T. Gatmaitan Z. Che M. Arias I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Planta. 1984; 162: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Deus-Neumann B. Zenk M.H. Planta. 1986; 167: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Hopp W. Seitz H.U. Planta. 1987; 170: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, vacuolar storage of glucosylated abiotic substances such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or transport of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside as well as uptake of phenolic compounds not present in the considered species into vacuoles have been demonstrated (6Sandermann H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 82-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 7Werner C. Matile P. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the vacuole has the potential to detoxify and store not only endogenous but also foreign, biotic, and abiotic glucosylated substances. Besides glycosylation, further metabolic modifications of the basic C15 structure of flavonoids are well known and include oxidation, hydroxylation, methylation, and acylation reactions (9Stafford H.A. Flavonoid Metabolism. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar), leading to the giant chemical diversity within this class of natural phenolic compounds. The respective ligands may play a role in substrate recognition of the corresponding, species-specific, vacuolar transporter. In the case of Petroselinum hortense and Daucus carota cell cultures, it has been shown that acylation of apigenin 7-O glucoside and an anthocyanin, respectively, was a prerequisite for uptake into vacuoles (5Hopp W. Seitz H.U. Planta. 1987; 170: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Matern U. Reichenbach C. Heller W. Planta. 1986; 167: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and that protonophores inhibited uptake of the anthocyanin into Daucus vacuoles (5Hopp W. Seitz H.U. Planta. 1987; 170: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Different strategies may be involved in vacuolar accumulation of coumaric acid glucosides: (i) vacuolar uptake of o-coumaric acid glucoside occurring in Melilotus alba was shown to be independent of ATP, but involved an isomerization of the trans- to the vacuolar deposited cis-isomer (11Rataboul P. Alibert G. Boller T. Boudet A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 816: 25-36Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). (ii) Esculin, a coumaric acid glucoside occurring in, e.g. potato but not in barley, was transported into barley vacuoles in an ATP-dependent, protonophore-sensitive manner, suggesting the existence of a proton antiport mechanism (7Werner C. Matile P. J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 118: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, Marrs et al. (12Marrs K. Alfenito M.R. Lloyd A.M. Walbot V. Nature. 1995; 375: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the gene characterized by the bronze-2 mutation, which is the last genetically defined step in anthocyanin biosynthesis in maize, encodes a glutathione S-transferase. They provided evidence that vacuolar deposition of the maize anthocyanin occurs via an intermediary, but yet unidentified, glutathione conjugate. From previous results showing the presence of an energized glutathione-conjugate ATPase (13Martinoia E. Grill E. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Nature. 1993; 364: 247-249Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 14Li Z.-S. Zhao Y. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it was suggested that anthocyanins may be accumulated within the vacuole via such a pump. Little information is available on the transport of glucosylated xenobiotics. We have shown that the herbicide glucoside hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside is transported into vacuoles of barley and that this transport is stimulated by safeners, substances conferring tolerance toward herbicides (8Gaillard C. Dufaud A. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this transport has not been characterized yet. Vacuolar accumulation of different compounds can be driven by the H+-ATPase or H+-pyrophosphatase via an H+ antiport mechanism (e.g. Na+/H+, Ca2+/H+), as a response to ΔΨ (e.g. malate) (15Martinoia E. Bot. Acta. 1992; 105: 232-245Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or directly by ATP as demonstrated for glutathione-conjugates (13Martinoia E. Grill E. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Nature. 1993; 364: 247-249Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 14Li Z.-S. Zhao Y. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and bile acids (16Hörtensteiner S. Vogt E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18446-18449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calculations based on ΔG0 values of ATP hydrolysis assuming cytosolic ATP, ADP, and Pi concentrations as published demonstrate that a much higher vacuolar accumulation can be expected by a directly energized glutathione-conjugate pump compared with secondary energized transport mechanisms (17Kreuz K. Tommassini R. Martinoia E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 111: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). There are many open questions concerning the energization of glucosylated phenolic substances, and no information is available on the transport of glucosylated xenobiotics. Therefore it was of interest to investigate (i) whether species-specific and/or general vacuolar transport mechanisms exist for endogenous and foreign glucosides in the same plant and (ii) which type of energization is used by the respective transport system. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Bakara) was grown as described (8Gaillard C. Dufaud A. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mesophyll cell protoplasts and vacuoles were isolated from 10-day-old primary leaves following a procedure of Rentsch and Martinoia (18Rentsch D. Martinoia E. Planta. 1991; 184: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). [14C]Isovitexin and [14C]orientin were prepared by feeding 40 5-day-old, dark-grown excised buckwheat cotyledons (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench cv. Prego) with 10 ml of aqueous solution containing 294 kBq ×μmol−1L-[U-14C]phenylalanine (DuPont NEN) as described (19Margna U. Margna G. Biochem. Physiol. Pflanzen (BPP). 1978; 173: 2-10Crossref Google Scholar). After 120 h of incubation the phenylpropanoid, compounds were extracted with 80% (v/v) MeOH (20Reuber S. Leitsch J. Krause G.H. Weissenböck G. Z. Naturforsch. 1993; 48c: 749-756Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the solution was evaporated and redissolved in MeOH. Separation of buckwheat flavonoids was performed on a preparative RP-18 column (30 cm × 16 mm) connected to a low pressure pump (Duramat CFG Prominent, Chemie und Filter GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The RP-18 column was preconditioned with 100 ml of 10% (v/v) acetic acid and washed with 300 ml of H2O. Phenylpropanes were eluted by raising the methanol concentration stepwise (0, 5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20% (v/v); 200 ml each). At 22.5% (v/v) methanol (800 ml) orientin and isovitexin were eluted and separated showing specific activities of 7.9 and 2.0 Bq × nmol−1, respectively, and a purity of >96% as judged from HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyABCATP-binding cassetteAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateHPS-glucosehydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside. analysis performed on a Shimadzu HPLC System (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) under the following conditions: Nucleosil RP-18 column (125 × 4.6 mm; 5 μm grain size; CS Chromatographie, Langerwehe, Germany), constant flow rate of 1 ml × min−1, solvent 12% (v/v) acetonitrile in water containing 1% o-phosphoric acid, detection at 340 nm.

Kreuz, unpublished results. with a radiochemical puritiy of 97% as judged by thin-layer chromatography. Uptake of [14C]isovitexin, [14C]orientin, and hydroxyprimisulfuron-[14C]glucoside into barley mesophyll vacuoles was measured as described (8Gaillard C. Dufaud A. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Martinoia E. Grill E. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Nature. 1993; 364: 247-249Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For each condition and time point, polyethylene microcentrifugation tubes (400 μl) were prepared as follows: 70 μl of incubation medium containing 23% (v/v) Percoll, 0.4 M sorbitol, 30 mM KCl, 25 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.12% bovine serum albumin, 0.55 kBq of [14C]isovitexin, 0.46 kBq of [14C]orientin, or 1.85 kBq of hydroxyprimisulfuron-[14C]glucoside, 3.7 kBq of 3H2O, and further solutes as indicated in the figures and tables were placed on the bottom of the tube. Uptake was started by addition of 30 μl of vacuole suspension. The samples were rapidly overlaid with 200 μl of silicone oil AR 200 (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and 60 μl of water. The incubation was terminated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 s. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in 50 μl of the upper aqueous phase containing the hypotonically shocked vacuoles. 3H2O was used to calculate the vacuolar volume as it equilibrates rapidly between the medium and the vacuolar lumen. Unless stated otherwise, uptake studies with unlabeled isovitexin were performed with 0.1 mM isovitexin in the above mentioned incubation medium with six tubes per condition and time point. After centrifugation the aqueous supernatants of three tubes were pooled, lyophilized, and redissolved in 100-200 μl of 80% (v/v) methanol before HPLC analysis. Separation of barley flavonoids was performed on the Shimadzu HPLC system using a Nucleosil RP-18 column (125 mm × 4.6 mm; 5 μm grain size; CS Chromatographie, Langerwehe, Germany) and a gradient system described previously (21Reuber S. Bornman J.F. Weissenböck G. Plant Cell Environ. 1996; 19: 593-601Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Uptake was calculated based on the vacuolar content of the major flavonoid saponarin showing no change in its concentration during the time course of the experiments (see “Results”) or based on the 3H2O counts measured in separate assays. Unless stated otherwise, uptake rates of hydroxyprimisulfuron-[14C]glucoside were calculated by subtracting the radioactivity measured after 2 min of incubation from the 20-min values and uptake rates of unlabeled isovitexin by subtracting the vacuolar isovitexin/saponarin ratio after 2 min from the corresponding 15-min value. Km and Vmax values were calculated using a computer program (Enzfitter, Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Plants contain a variety of glycosylated endogenous compounds and are able to glucosylate abiotic substances as a possible step in the detoxification of xenobiotics. For both groups of glucosides vacuolar localization is generally assumed. In an attempt to compare the transport specificities of an abiotic glucoside with two plant-borne glucosides across the vacuolar membrane, we used hydroxyprimisulfuron-[14C]glucoside (Fig. 1C); isovitexin (apigenin 6-C-glucoside, Fig. 1A) and orientin (luteolin 8-C-glucoside, Fig. 1B). Uptake of 380 μM [14C]isovitexin, a minor barley flavonoid, was linear with time for about 15 min and slightly stimulated by MgATP, while the luteolin derivative orientin at 220 μM, occurring, e.g. in buckwheat but not detectable in barley primary leaves, was obviously excluded from the vacuole (Fig. 2A). As the incorporation rate of 14C label from phenylalanine into the buckwheat flavonoids was not sufficient for large scale experiments, isovitexin uptake was studied using unlabeled substrate and detection of the flavonoid by HPLC. Vacuolar and whole leaf extracts of Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Bakara contain only trace amounts of isovitexin being the precursor of saponarin (isovitexin 7-O-glucoside) (22Seikel M.K. Geissman T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1957; 71: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which accumulates as the major compound (Fig. 2B). Unlabeled isovitexin is readily taken up by barley vacuoles with a time dependence and MgATP stimulation comparable with the results obtained using [14C]isovitexin. The fact that only the isovitexin peak increases with time (Fig. 2B), while the amounts of all other detected compounds remain constant, suggests that neither isovitexin is converted into saponarin via glucosylation nor saponarin is deglucosylated to isovitexin during the course of the experiment. This observation is further supported by the fact that the uptake rate did not change when barley vacuoles were incubated in the presence of 100 μM isovitexin together with 10 mM UDP-glucose (Table I). The saponarin content (0.42 ± 0.09 × 10−3 mol × liter−1 vacuolar volume, mean of 10 determinations) can therefore be used as a marker for vacuolar space in isovitexin uptake experiments in addition to 3H2O volume determined in separate assays. The transport rates calculated using the two parameters proved to be identical within experimental error.Fig. 2Time-dependent uptake of flavonoid glucosides using 14C-labeled flavonoids (A) and unlabeled isovitexin (B).

Dufaud A. Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Transport of isovitexin is a saturable process with an apparent Km value of 82 ± 38 μM and Vmax of 6.09 ± 1.66 × 10−7 mol of isovitexin × s−1× liter−1 (n = 5) (data not shown). In contrast, the hydroxyprimisulfuron-[14C]glucoside exhibts a linear concentration dependence up to 250 μM (data not shown), indicating the presence of a low affinity transport system. ATP-dependent stimulation of the herbicide glucoside and the flavonoid glucosides is remarkably different: while isovitexin uptake is stimulated 1.4-fold, a 2.5-3-fold increase of the uptake rate can be observed for the herbicide glucoside (Table I). However, the MgATP-stimulated transport rates of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside and isovitexin (4.32 ± 1.21 × 10−8 mol of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside × s−1× liter−1 and 6.87 ± 2.17 × 10−7 mol of isovitexin × s−1× liter−1) both at 100 μM, respectively, indicate a 10-20-fold higher flux of the flavonoid compared to the xenobiotic glucoside. The ratio of the uptake rate of isovitexin in the presence or absence of ATP does not increase at lower concentrations (1.2-fold at 20 μM isovitexin), suggesting that the protons transferred by the vacuolar H+-ATPase are not a limiting step in energization. Incubation of vacuoles for 15 min with 100 μM isovitexin results in vacuolar concentrations of 380 ± 150 in the absence and 560 ± 190 μM isovitexin in the presence of MgATP (n > 7), demonstrating uptake against the concentration gradient. Mg2+ or ATP alone as well as ADP are not able to stimulate uptake of both subtrates, and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP cannot substitute for ATP, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is a prerequisite for transport energization (Table I). In the case of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside, but not for isovitexin, UTP and GTP can partially substitute for ATP, stimulating uptake about 2-fold. Pyrophosphate, driving the proton pumping pyrophosphatase, does not stimulate the uptake of both glucosides. However, the activity of the pyrophosphatase amounts only to 25% of the activity of the vacuolar H+-ATPase in 10-day-old primary leaves of barley (data not shown). Differences in the transport mechanisms of the two glucosides can also be observed using inhibitors of ATPases and reagents affecting ΔpH or Δψ (Table II). MgATP-stimulated transport of the herbicide glucoside is not inhibited by bafilomycin A1, a highly specific inhibitor of the vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase (23Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). The uptake of isovitexin decreases in the presence of this antibiotic to levels observed in the absence of ATP. Vanadate, an inhibitor acting as a phosphate analogue, strongly decreases the uptake of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside, but not of isovitexin. The transport of both glucosides is not inhibited by azide, an effector of F-type ATPases. A different behavior of the two transport systems is also observed after the addition of NH4Cl, which dissipates the ΔpH across the membrane, resulting in a strongly inhibited isovitexin transport, whereas hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside is only slightly affected in the presence of MgATP. However, addition of NH4Cl in the absence of MgATP reduces the uptake rate of the herbicide glucoside to about 44% of the control without ATP. Thus, a nonenergized component of herbicide glucoside uptake may be affected by protonophores in contrast to the major component observed in the presence of ATP. Valinomycin, a K+-specific ionophore, has an inhibitory but yet weaker effect on flavonoid glucoside uptake compared with the effect of the ΔpH-dissipating reagent. Surprisingly, saponarin efflux is not observed after destroying ΔpH or ΔΨ (data not shown).Table IIEffect of inhibitors on the MgATP-stimulated uptake of isovitexin and hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside into barley vacuolesTreatmentTransport ofHPS-glucoseIsovitexin% of MgATP-stimulated uptakeControl100100+Bafilomycin A1 (0.1 μM)114.0 ± 16.079.3 ± 5.7+Vanadate (0.2 mM)42.6 ± 7.8104.9 ± 16.2+NaN3 (1 mM)92.092.5 ± 0.5+NH4Cl (5 mM)87.0 ± 10.029.1 ± 14.8+Valinomycin (5 μM)ND46.9 ± 7.6 Open table in a new tab To obtain further information on substrate specificities of the two transport systems, competition experiments were performed (Table III). As unstimulated uptake of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside is very low (Table I), MgATP was added in competition experiments with the herbicide glucoside. In contrast, the isovitexin competition experiments were performed in the absence of MgATP with only a 3-fold excess of all competitors (120 μM) due to the limited solubility of flavonoids in aqueous solution. However, the degree of inhibition did not change in the presence of ATP (data not shown). Uptake of the apigenin-derivative isovitexin is reduced or completely inhibited in the presence of other apigenins (Table III). On the other hand, luteolin derivatives do not affect isovitexin uptake. Isovitexin uptake is reduced to about 40% by the addition of β-methylumbelliferyl glucoside, while the corresponding α-isomer has no effect. All other phenolic glucosides tested so far show only low competition with isovitexin uptake. It should be noted that addition of the flavonoid glucosides or other glucosides competing isovitexin did not result in changes of the HPLC pattern. Accordingly, no additional peaks were detected at 340 nm, suggesting that chemical reactions or interactions of competitors with isovitexin are unlikely.Table IIIInfluence of potential competitive inhibitors, flavonoid-glucosides, and other glucosylated substances, on the uptake of isovitexin and hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucosideTreatmentDerivative ofTransport ofHPS-glucoseIsovitexin% of controlControl100100+SaponarinApigeninND41.9 ± 17.6+Apigenin 7-O-glucosideApigenin17.7 ± 1.50.0 ± 4.7+VitexinApigenin73.1 ± 4.681.4 ± 5.6+IsovitexinApigenin44.6 ± 1.2+OrientinLuteolinND98.1+LutonarinLuteolinND125.3+Quercitrin65.6 ± 7.4ND+SinigrinGlucosinolate81.093.3 ± 4.7+ArbutinSimple phenol74.7 ± 6.084.9 ± 6.9+EsculinCoumarin6086.6 ± 3.5+α-Methylumbelliferyl glucosideCoumarin95.0 ± 9.581.7 ± 8.8+β-Methylumbelliferyl glucosideCoumarin70.4 ± 3.939.3 ± 5.9 Open table in a new tab Surprisingly, the competition pattern of apigenin glucosides added to hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside at a final concentration of 120 μM is comparable with the results obtained with isovitexin (Table II). Apigenin 7-O-glucoside inhibits the uptake of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside to about 80%, while vitexin has a much lower effect. In addition, isovitexin itself reduces uptake of the herbicide glucoside by about 55%. Other glucosides, which were in contrast to isovitexin experiments added at a final concentration of 1 mM, inhibit transport of the abiotic compound between 5 and 40% with esculin being the most inhibitory. In correspondence to the results obtained for isovitexin, the β-isomer of methylumbelliferyl glucoside has a more pronounced inhibitory effect on the uptake of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside than the isomer bearing the glucose residue in the α-position. However, β-methylumbelliferyl glucoside decreases the transport of the herbicide glucoside only by about 30%, while isovitexin uptake is stronger affected by this compound (60% inhibition). Discrepancies exist between the observation that investigations using plant-specific secondary products exhibited species-specific uptake into vacuoles of the corresponding substance and the description of heterologue or even abiotic substances entering the vacuole (3Deus-Neumann B. Zenk M.H. Planta. 1984; 162: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Deus-Neumann B. Zenk M.H. Planta. 1986; 167: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Hopp W. Seitz H.U.

Tommasini R. Kreuz K. Amrhein N. Martinoia E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The goal of our investigation was to elucidate whether two different glucosides taken up by barley vacuoles use identical or different transport systems and which energization mechanisms are involved. Our results strongly suggest that two different mechanisms exist for the transport of the flavonoid glucoside isovitexin (apigenin 6-C-glucoside, Fig. 1A) and of a herbicide glucoside (hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside, Fig. 1C) for the following reasons: (i) uptake of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside is quite slow under nonenergized conditions but is stimulated 2.5-3-fold in the presence of MgATP. In contrast, isovitexin uptake exhibits a much higher absolute uptake rate, while the addition of MgATP has only a slight but reproducible effect (Fig. 2B and Table I). (ii) There are remarkable differences in nucleotide specificities, since UTP and GTP can partially substitute for ATP only in the case of the herbicide glucoside (Table I). The observation that GTP rather inhibits flavonoid uptake is not understood yet. (iii) Transport of isovitexin and hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside is differentially affected by inhibitors specific for different types of ATPases. Based on these observations we propose that two glucoside transporters exist differing in their energization mechanism. Isovitexin transport by barley vacuoles is driven by the ΔpH, while at least 60% of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside uptake is mediated by a directly energized carrier. The herbicide glucoside carrier may be a novel member of the transport ATPases belonging to the ABC family, which have been found during the last years in animals, fungi, and plants. ABC transporters are thought to be mainly involved in the cellular detoxification mechanisms (24Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar). However, for many of these ABC transporters only the respective gene is known, while the corresponding substrate is unknown (25Balzi E. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For plants it has been shown that two different transport activities reside in the vacuolar membrane, which are directly energized by ATP: the transfer of glutathione S-conjugates (13Martinoia E.

These carriers accumulate their substrate in the vacuole, even if the vacuolar H+-ATPase is inhibited by bafilomycin and the ΔpH abolished by NH4Cl. In the case of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside, the uptake rates were too low to proof accumulation against a concentration gradient. However, the general properties are very similar as compared with the other described directly energized transporters: requirement for MgATP; GTP and UTP can partially substitute for ATP; transport is not inhibited by bafilomycin and NH4Cl but by vanadate. Therefore we suggest that the MgATP-dependent component of the hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside transport activity occurs by a directly energized ATPase. So far, transport of species-specific flavonoids across the vacuolar membrane has only been studied for acylated flavonoid glycosides (5Hopp W. Seitz H.U. Planta. 1987; 170: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Matern U. Reichenbach C. Heller W. Planta. 1986; 167: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In these cases, the corresponding deacylated compounds were not taken up by the vacuoles. In this report, we clearly show that neither acylation nor conjugation to glutathione as proposed by Marrs et al. (12Marrs K. Alfenito M.R. Lloyd A.M. Walbot V. Nature. 1995; 375: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) for maize anthocyanins are necessary for vacuolar transport and accumulation of flavonoid-glucosides in barley. The fact that treatment with NH4Cl inhibits isovitexin uptake into barley vacuoles strongly suggests that flavonoid-glucoside import may occur via an H+/isovitexin antiport mechanism. Attempts to demonstrate a proton extrusion induced by isovitexin using intact vacuoles or tonoplast vesicles and the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine, as recently shown by Getz and Klein (26Getz H.P. Klein M. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 107: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for the sucrose/H+-antiporter of red beet storage parenchyma, failed due to chemical interaction of the dye with the flavonoid. However, as the isovitexin uptake rate is also reduced in the presence of valinomycin, a K+-ionophore known to dissipate the membrane potential, flavonoid glucoside transport may also be coupled to that of K+. An alternative explanation would be that the carrier is activated at inside positive membrane potentials generated by the vacuolar proton pumps (27Sze H. Ward J.M. Lai S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Saponarin, the major barley flavonoid, is synthesized by a soluble UDP-glucose-dependent glucosyltransferase (Table I; Ref. 28Blume D.E. Jaworski J.G. McClure J.W. Planta. 1979; 146: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The fact that isovitexin is taken up efficiently by isolated vacuoles suggests that in vivo the glucosylation step is faster and/or that the affinity of of the transporter for saponarin is much higher than for isovitexin. Other apigenin derivatives inhibit isovitexin uptake in contrast to luteolin-type compounds as lutonarin and orientin (Table III, Fig. 1B), and the luteolin derivative orientin is not taken up at all by barley vacuoles (Fig. 2A). As apigenin and luteolin differ only in the molecular structure of the aromatic B-ring (apigenin with a single hydroxyl group in 3′-position, luteolin with two hyxdroxyl groups in positions 3′ and 4′), the substitution pattern of the B-ring seems to contain an important recognition signal for binding and transport of the apigenin derivative. However, β-methylumbelliferyl glucoside inhibits isovitexin uptake much stronger than the α-isomer, indicating that (i) the position of the glucose substituent plays an important role in substrate binding and (ii) that other structural features than the B-ring may be additionally responsible for recognition. Surprisingly, inhibition of hydroxyprimisulfuron-glucoside transport with different glucosides shows a similar picture as compared with isovitexin. Therefore, it is suggested that the substrate recognition is comparable for both transport systems and that in the case of isovitexin a directly energized component is not apparent due to the much higher uptake activity of the ΔpH-dependent system. Our results presented here indicate that at least two different carriers are responsible for the transport of glucosylated substances across the vacuolar membrane. The one is involved in detoxification and storage processes of endogenous phenolic compounds. Concerning the directly energized carrier system, the interesting questions arises, whether the directly energized transport system drives the uptake of an endogenous, so far unknown glucoside and whether plants have evolved a general internal “excretion” system for exogenous compounds that are recognized as potentially toxic by the plant.

The functional activities of three possible vitamin D response elements (VDREs), located on the antisense strand of the rat CYP24 promoter, were investigated by transient expression of native and mutant promoter constructs in COS-1, JTC-12, and ROS 17/2.8 cells. A putative VDRE with a half-site spacing of 6 base pairs at −249/−232 (VDRE-3) did not contribute to 1,25-(OH)2D3 induced expression in the native promoter, although activity has been reported when the element was fused to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Two VDREs with half-site spacings of 3 base pairs at −150/−136 and −258/−244 (VDRE-1 and VDRE-2, respectively), showed transcriptional synergism in COS-1 cells when treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10−7 to 10−11M). The contribution of both VDREs was hormone-concentration dependent from 10−10 to 10−12M, with VDRE-1 demonstrating greatest sensitivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3.

At concentrations between 0.1 and 0.4 μM, the drug strongly depolymerized microtubules at minus ends, whereas it did not significantly depolymerize microtubules at plus ends. Vinblastine stabilized plus ends by suppressing the rate and extent of growth and shortening, decreasing the catastrophe frequency, and increasing the rescue frequency. In contrast, vinblastine destabilized minus ends by increasing the catastrophe frequency and decreasing the rescue frequency, whereas it had no effect on the rate or extent of growth or shortening. Thus, vinblastine moderately increased the overall dynamicity at minus ends while strongly suppressing dynamicity at plus ends.

Furthermore, using the yeast 2-hybrid system, we show that association between these components can occur independent of additional eukaryotic proteins. We show that SAPK(JNK) or p38hog activation is specifically impaired by co-expression of cognate dominant negative MAP kinase kinase mutants, demonstrating functional specificity at this level. Further divergence and insulation of the stress pathways occurs proximal to the MAPK kinases since activation of the MAPK kinase kinase MEKK results in SAPK(JNK) activation but does not cause p38hog phosphorylation.

PGHS-2 is inducibly expressed in these cells following stimulation with serum or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis established that a variety of G protein-linked and peroxisomal proliferator-activated prostanoid receptors are expressed in both of these cell types. The levels of the EP2 and EP4 prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors and the prostaglandin I2 receptor were changed in these cells by serum or LPS stimulation. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that the mRNA for the murine EP4 receptor, the butaprost-insensitive PGE2 receptor that couples to Gs, increases 1.5-3-fold in response to serum (NIH 3T3) or LPS (RAW 264.7) with a time course approximating the induction of PGHS-2 expression. To study expression of the EP4 receptor we isolated the mouse EP4 receptor gene; the gene is 10 kilobase pairs (kb) in length and, like other known prostanoid receptor genes, contains three exons and two introns. The first intron is 0.5 kb and is located 16 base pairs (bp) downstream of the translational start site.

One system uses the constitutive PGHS-1 as the initiating enzyme and functions primarily in the ER to produce prostanoids that act extracellularly through G protein-linked receptors (5Coleman R.A.

A second system, involving the inducible PGHS-2, appears to produce prostanoids that act, at least in part, at the level of the cell nucleus (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Dixon F.J. Advances in Immunology. Vol. 62. Academic Press Inc., Orlando, FL1996: 167-215Google Scholar, 3Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

In the work described in this report, we first used RT-PCR to identify those G protein-linked and PPARγ prostanoid receptors that are expressed in quiescent and activated murine NIH 3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells. This led us to examine the structure and regulation of expression of the gene for the EP4 receptor, the butaprost-insensitive, PGE2 receptor which is coupled to Gs. Overall, these studies are potentially important in determining which receptors are involved in mediating prostanoid responses associated with cell replication and differentiation.Both NIH 3T3 cells and RAW 264.7 cells expressed mRNAs for several G protein-linked prostanoid receptors. PPARγ was expressed in RAW 264.7 cells but not NIH 3T3 cells. Assuming that at least some of the prostanoids formed via PGHS-2 act on nuclear targets in association with cell replication, the finding that the PPARγ was present only in RAW 264.7 cells suggests that this receptor is not uniformly involved in mediating nuclear actions of prostanoids.The EP4 and IP receptors were the only receptors expressed by both NIH 3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells. In each of these cell types, stimulation with serum or LPS, respectively, led to small but consistent increases in EP4 receptor mRNA expression and consistent decreases in IP receptor expression. In both cell types a peak in EP4 receptor mRNA expression occurred at about the same time as the peak level of PGHS-2 mRNA (29DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 37Riese J. Hoff T. Nordhoff A. DeWitt D.L. Resch K. Kaever V. J.

This observation raises the possibility that the increases in EP4 receptor expression are important in mediating effects of PGE2 related to cell replication and/or differentiation. The EP4 receptor is coupled to cAMP synthesis and is probably a cell surface receptor (22Honda A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Watabe A. Irie A. Negishi M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7759-7762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The EP4 receptor gene was found to contain three exons and two introns. A similar overall structure has been found for TP (51Nusing R.M. Hirata M. Kakizuka A. Eki T. Ozawa K. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25253-25259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), EP1 (52Batshake B. Nilsson C. Sundelin J. Eur. J.

Genomics. 1995; 27: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) prostanoid receptor genes. In all of these cases, including that of the EP4 receptor, the second intron occurs at the end of the putative sixth transmembrane domain. However, the first intron of the EP4 receptor gene is located within the coding region of the receptor cDNA, whereas the first introns for other prostanoid receptor genes characterized to date are found on the 5′-side of the ATG translational start sites (51Nusing R.M.

Genomics. 1995; 27: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, the first intron is relatively small (0.5 kb) in the case of the EP4 receptor gene. DP, EP2, EP4, and IP receptors are classified in the same phylogenetic cluster, CL-1, whereas TP and EP1 receptors are in cluster CL-2, and EP3 receptors are in cluster CL-3 (55Toh H. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). EP4 receptors are divided from other receptors of the CL-1 cluster at an early evolutionary stage. The overall organizations of the DP and IP receptor genes are more similar to the TP receptor gene than to the EP4 receptor gene. Thus, the EP3 receptor gene in cluster CL-3 may have the same structure as other previously characterized prostanoid receptor genes, and only the EP4 receptor gene (and perhaps the EP2 receptor gene) may have a structure different from that of other prostanoid receptor genes.EP4 receptor mRNA is detectable and thus is apparently expressed constitutively in murine lung, spleen, and ileum (22Honda A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Watabe A. Irie A. Negishi M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7759-7762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); we find that it is also present in both quiescent and activated NIH 3T3 cells and RAW 264.7 cells. Consistent with this basal level expression, the promoter region of the EP4 receptor gene resembles that of a typical constitutive “housekeeping” gene having a GC-rich region (from −201 to −1150) highly populated with Sp1 sites and lacking a functional TATA box (56Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (370) Google Scholar). 2A TATA box sequence is located at −1431 bp of the EP4 receptor gene. However, no transcriptional start sites were located within 50 bp downstream of this TATA box, suggesting that it may not be a functional element.Although EP4 receptor mRNA appears to be expressed in many cells and tissues, 1.5-3-fold increases in EP4 receptor mRNA did occur in response to both serum (3T3 cells) and LPS (RAW 264.7 cells), indicating that the EP4 receptor gene is inducible. In the case of RAW 264.7 cells, which have the cell surface monocyte CD14 antigen, the LPS/serum LPS-binding protein complex binds to CD14 and elicits intracellular signals (57Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar). When we examined the expression and induction by serum/LPS of five different constructs of the EP4 receptor gene promoter in murine RAW 264.7 cells, a maximal increase in luciferase activity was observed with the pGLep4-5 construct containing nucleotides −116 to −554 bp. There are Sp1 and AP2 elements and an E-box in this region. Although Sp1 sites are essential for CD14 expression (58Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Tan S. Dziennis S.E. Gonzalez D.A. Chen H.-M. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11425-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have not resolved which specific response element(s) is essential for EP4 receptor gene expression.The expression of PGHS-2 is stimulated by a number of agents including serum, tumor-promoting phorbol esters, cytokines, growth factors, cytotoxins, etc. (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Dixon F.J. Advances in Immunology. Vol. 62. Academic Press Inc., Orlando, FL1996: 167-215Google Scholar). Several transcription factors have been identified as regulators of PGHS-2 gene expression including NF-IL6 (C/EBPβ) (59Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol.

It will be important to determine if any of these elements are functional during the stimulation of expression of the EP4 receptor gene.

Prostanoids cause a variety of physiological actions including contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle, inhibition and stimulation of neurotransmitter release, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, inhibition of inflammatory mediator release, regulation of platelet aggregation, and control of water and salt reabsorption in the kidney (1Smith W.L.

Satriano J.A. Bao Y. Wolkoff A.W. Schuster V.L. Science. 1995; 268: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Following their exit from cells, these newly formed prostanoids mediate their effects through cell surface, G protein-linked receptors (5Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol.

Prostanoids are also synthesized in association with the nuclear envelope, at least in part through the actions of PGHS-2, and in association with cell replication or cell differentiation (2Smith W.L.

We now demonstrate that when a growth factor binds reversibly to the matrix, its effects are augmented by this interaction, and when the factor is absorbed irreversibly to the extracellular matrix, it becomes sequestered. These findings call into question the notion that all growth factors are best presented to cells and tissues in a sustained and controlled fashion. In our studies, we examined basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) release kinetics from synthetically fabricated microsphere devices and naturally synthesized extracellular matrix. While the sustained release of bFGF was up to 3.0-fold more potent at increasing vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation than bolus administration, the reverse was true for TGF-β1. A bolus of TGF-β1 inhibited vascular cells up to 3.8-fold more efficiently than the same amount of TGF-β1 if control-released. Both growth factors bound to the extracellular matrix, but only bFGF was released in a controlled fashion (2.8%/day). Contact with the extracellular matrix and subsequent release enhanced bFGF activity such that it was 86% more effective at increasing smooth muscle cell numbers than equal amounts of growth factor diluted from frozen stock. TGF-β1 remained tightly adherent. The small amount of TGF-β1 released from the extracellular matrix was ∼30% less effective than bolus administration at inhibiting vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cell growth.

Biochemical mechanisms that regulate these posttranslational steps are not well understood. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a poor activator of IL-1 posttranslational processing despite serving as a potent inducer of IL-1 synthesis. For example, freshly isolated human monocytes treated with LPS released <30% of their newly synthesized IL-1β as the mature 17-kDa cytokine species, and monocytes that were aged overnight in culture prior to LPS treatment released no 17-kDa cytokine. In contrast, addition of extracellular ATP promoted IL-1β posttranslational processing from both monocyte populations. Previous studies indicated that ATP, acting via surface P2Z-type receptors, promoted major intracellular ionic changes. To explore whether these ionic changes were required for cytokine posttranslational processing, LPS-stimulated human monocytes were maintained in ionically altered media. Hypotonic conditions promoted an efficient and selective release of mature 17-kDa IL-1β from LPS-activated monocytes in the absence of ATP. In contrast, hypertonic conditions blocked the ATP-induced posttranslational processing reactions. Both hypotonic stress- and ATP-induced processing were blocked when NaI was substituted for NaCl within the medium; substitution with NaSCN or NaNO3 also blocked the ATP response, but these salts were less inhibitory against the hypotonic stimulus. Sodium glucuronate substitution did not inhibit cytokine processing induced by either stimulus. Removal of divalent cations from the medium did not affect the ATP response, but pretreatment of monocytes with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid dose-dependently suppressed ATP-induced IL-1β posttranslational processing. A volume-induced change to the intracellular ionic environment, therefore, may represent a key element of the mechanism by which IL-1β posttranslational processing is initiated.

When administered to target cells, IL-1β binds to cell-surface receptors and promotes various pro-inflammatory activities including enhanced production of matrix metalloproteinases, increased expression of adhesion molecules, and enhanced prostaglandin synthesis (3Bevilacqua M.P.

In view of its many pro-inflammatory activities, in vivo production of IL-1β is likely to be controlled at many levels. Indeed, recent in vitro studies indicate that IL-1β production is regulated via both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms (7Burchett S.K. Weaver W.M. Westall J.A. Larsen A. Kronheim S.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 2168-2179PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse peritoneal macrophages, for example, synthesize large quantities of IL-1β mRNA and protein in response to LPS stimulation. This translated product, however, corresponds to the inactive 35-kDa pro-IL-1β species which is neither proteolytically processed nor released into the medium (13Hogquist K.A. Nett M.A. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8485-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 14Perregaux D. Barberia J. Lanzetti A.J. Geoghegan K.F. Carty T.J. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1294-1303PubMed Google Scholar). Externalization and proteolytic maturation of the pro-IL-1β polypeptide requires an additional stimulus. To date, identified agents that can serve as this secondary stimulus in vitro include ATP, cytolytic T-cells, and potassium ionophores such as nigericin (13Hogquist K.A. Nett M.A. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8485-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 14Perregaux D. Barberia J. Lanzetti A.J. Geoghegan K.F. Carty T.J. Gabel C.A. J.

Likewise, production of mature biologically active IL-1β by LPS-stimulated freshly isolated human monocytes can be dissociated into two distinct steps. Low concentrations of LPS activate monocytes to produce pro-IL-1β, but this newly synthesized cytokine is not proteolytically processed or released (15Chin J. Kostura M.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5574-5585PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, high concentrations of LPS (>20 ng/ml) promote synthesis of comparable levels of pro-IL-1β and, in addition, stimulate its release and maturation (15Chin J. Kostura M.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5574-5585PubMed Google Scholar). interleukin 1β interleukin 1 converting enzyme lactate dehydrogenase lipopolysaccharide regulated volume decrease 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid fetal bovine serum 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid. The efficiency of IL-1 release from human monocytes treated only with LPS is variable and correlates with release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (17Hogquist K.A. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2181-2186PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, agents like ATP and nigericin that promote efficient externalization of mature 17-kDa IL-1β from LPS-treated murine peritoneal macrophages cause cell death, possibly via an apoptotic mechanism (13Hogquist K.A. Nett M.A. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8485-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the enzyme responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1β to its mature counterpart, interleukin convertase (ICE), is a homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3 (18Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar), and overexpression of murine ICE in rat fibroblasts leads to apoptotic-like features (19Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the posttranslational processing and release of pro-IL-1β may be linked to cell death. In a previous study we compared the processes by which nigericin and ATP promoted the posttranslational maturation of IL-1β from LPS-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages (20Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these agents promoted efflux of potassium from the cell, and this efflux appeared necessary for the posttranslational processing reactions. This requirement for K+ export was confirmed recently, and two non-selective inhibitors of K+ channels, triethanolamine and 4-aminopyridine, were reported to block cytokine maturation (21Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In a related study, release of mature IL-1β from LPS-stimulated human monocytes and mouse peritoneal macrophages was shown to be impaired by agents that disrupted anion transport processes, including DIDS, ethacrynic acid, and tenidap, a new anti-inflammatory/anti-arthritic agent (16Laliberte R. Perregaux D. Svensson L. Pazoles C.J. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2168-2179PubMed Google Scholar). Changes to the intracellular ionic environment, therefore, appear to be required for activation of the posttranslational maturation of pro-IL-1β. In the present study we have continued to explore ionic conditions required for this unusual cytokine processing event. ATP and hypotonic stress are employed as alternative signals to activate human monocyte IL-1β posttranslational processing. Sensitivity of these cellular activation processes to changes of the ionic environment and to pharmacological effectors suggests that an anion transporter is a necessary component of the mechanism by which both hypotonic stress and ATP promote IL-1β posttranslational processing. Mononuclear cells were isolated from blood (100 ml) drawn from normal volunteers as described previously (16Laliberte R. Perregaux D. Svensson L. Pazoles C.J. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2168-2179PubMed Google Scholar). In an average experiment, 1 × 107 mononuclear cells were added to each well of 6-well dishes in a total volume of 2 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Maintenance Medium). Monocytes were allowed to adhere for 2 h, after which the supernatants were discarded and the attached cells were rinsed once with 2 ml of Maintenance Medium. When freshly isolated monocytes were employed, the adherent cells immediately were exposed to 10 ng/ml LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5, Sigma) for 2 h. Alternatively, the adherent monocytes were incubated overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment in Maintenance Medium prior to LPS activation; where indicated, 5 ng/ml recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the culture medium. In all cases LPS-stimulated cells were labeled for 60 min in 1 ml of Pulse Medium (methionine-free RPMI 1640, 1% dialyzed FBS, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 83 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp., 1000 Ci/mmol)). The Pulse Medium subsequently was discarded; the radiolabeled cells were washed once with 2 ml of Chase Medium (RPMI 1640, 1% FBS, 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM NaHCO3, pH 6.9), and 1 ml of Chase Medium that contained various effector molecules was added to each well. Where indicated, ATP was added (from a 100 mM stock solution previously adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH) to a final concentration of 1-5 mM. Radiolabeled monocytes were chased at 37°C for various times after which the medium was recovered and clarified by centrifugation to remove cells that detached from the plate during the chase and cell debris; the resulting supernatants were harvested and adjusted to 1% in Triton X-100, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM iodoacetic acid, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin by addition of concentrated stock solutions of these reagents. Cells were solubilized by addition of 1 ml of an extraction buffer composed of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM iodoacetic acid, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml ovalbumin. After a 30-min incubation on ice, both the media and cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge using a TLA 45 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). IL-1β was immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of cell and media samples as detailed previously (16Laliberte R. Perregaux D. Svensson L. Pazoles C.J. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2168-2179PubMed Google Scholar). Disaggregated immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207467) Google Scholar); gels were soaked in Amplify (Amersham Corp.) prior to drying. Quantitation of the amount of radioactivity associated with the various species of IL-1β was determined with the use of an Ambis Image Analysis System (San Diego, CA). Aliquots of media samples and cell extracts were assayed for LDH using pyruvate as substrate and a colorimetric pyruvate detection assay (Sigma). A modified Dulbecco's based formulation was employed to prepare isotonic medium (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 137 mM NaCl, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl, and 5 mM glucose). In some cases, NaCl was substituted with NaI, NaSCN, NaNO3, or sodium glucuronate; all sodium salts were obtained from Sigma. Freshly isolated human monocytes are heterogeneous with respect to their size and functional properties (23Lewis C.E. McCarthy S.P. Lorenzen J. McGee O.D. Immunology. 1989; 69: 402-408Google Scholar, 24Wang S.-Y. Mak K.L. Chen L.Y. Chou M.P. Ho C.K. Immunology. 1992; 77: 298-303PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, when maintained in culture these cells may change their biochemical properties (25Blanchard D.K. Djeu J.Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 50: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Tsai V. Firestein G.S. Arend W. Zvaifler N.J. Cell. Immunol. 1992; 144: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), including their ability to respond to extracellular ATP (27Hickman S.E. Khoury J.E. Greenberg S. Schieren I. Silverstein S.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2452-2456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Blanchard D.K. McMillen S. Djeu J.Y. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2579-2585PubMed Google Scholar, 29Falzoni S. Munerati M. Ferrari D. Spisani S. Moretti S. Di Virgilio F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Based on this known heterogeneity, a comparison of the IL-1β posttranslational processing capacity of freshly isolated monocytes and monocytes that were aged overnight in culture was performed. Each population was stimulated for 2 h with LPS, labeled for 60 min with [35S]methionine, and chased in the absence or presence of ATP. In the absence of ATP, freshly isolated monocytes released proteolytically processed radiolabeled 17-kDa IL-1β (Table I); based on recovery of total radiolabeled IL-1β from these cultures, however, the 17-kDa species generally accounted for <30% of the newly synthesized cytokine. High concentrations of LPS are known to favor mature IL-1β release (15Chin J. Kostura M.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5574-5585PubMed Google Scholar), but even at a concentration of 1 μg/ml only 26% of the total radiolabeled cytokine was recovered as the extracellular mature species (experiment 2; Table I). Aged monocytes, on the other hand, did not release significant mature IL-1β in the presence of LPS (Table I). In contrast, both monocyte populations responded to ATP and released proteolytically processed 17-kDa IL-1β; the nucleotide triphosphate, however, did not affect both populations equally. Thus, freshly isolated monocytes consistently released >90% of their IL-1β as the 17-kDa mature species but only 50-60% of the radiolabeled cytokine was released as the mature species from aged monocytes (Table I).Table IComparison of IL-1 release by fresh and aged human monocytesExperimentMonocyte populationTreatmentTotal IL-1β/LDH% of total as 17 kDa IL-1β1FreshNo ATP3,97015+ 2 mM ATP17,700922FreshNo ATP81,30026+ 5 mM ATP296,000893AgedNo ATP11,4001+ 2 mM ATP32,200634AgedNo ATP5,4001+ 2 mM ATP10,05055 Open table in a new tab In the presence of ATP an apparent over-recovery of radiolabeled IL-1β consistently was observed. For example, a total of 3970 counts were recovered as IL-1β from LPS-treated fresh monocytes in the absence of ATP (experiment 1; Table I). Following ATP treatment, however, total radioactivity recovered as immunoprecipitable IL-1β from an identical culture increased >4-fold (Table I). Since radiolabeled methionine was removed from the culture medium prior to the addition of ATP, new synthesis of IL-1β cannot account for this over-recovery. Moreover, the antibody employed to capture radiolabeled IL-1β was not limiting. Treatment of monocyte extracts (derived from cells not exposed to ATP) with increasing polyclonal antibody did not yield additional radiolabeled IL-1β. Rather, it appeared that conditions which led to an increase in IL-1β posttranslational maturation also led to an increase in cytokine recovery. This over-recovery may result from a decrease in the intracellular turnover of newly synthesized cytokine and/or a change in IL-1β that allows recognition by the antibody. Similar differences were observed in the quantity of radiolabeled IL-1β recovered in the absence or presence of ATP from aged monocyte cultures (Table I). Although the cause of this over-recovery remains to be determined, the results indicate that ATP is a potent inducer of IL-1β release and maturation and that the extent of these posttranslational processing reactions varies between different monocyte populations. These differences suggest that the ATP response is not passive but, rather, requires active participation of the IL-1β producing cell. Based on previous observations suggesting that anion and potassium fluxes are necessary for the posttranslational maturation of IL-1β (14Perregaux D. Barberia J. Lanzetti A.J. Geoghegan K.F.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), LPS-stimulated monocytes were subjected to hypotonic stress, a treatment known to promote KCl export in a wide variety of cells (30Hoffmann E.K. Simonsen L.O. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 315-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated human monocytes were stimulated with LPS for 2 h, labeled with [35S]methionine for 60 min, and then chased for 3 h in media of differing ionic strength. The base medium in this experiment consisted of a standard Dulbecco's formulation (Table II). Hypotonic media were prepared by varying the concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and KH2PO4; concentrations of other media components, including Ca2+, Mg2+, NaHCO3, glucose, and Hepes, were maintained at constant values (Table II). The chase media varied in NaCl concentration from 132 to 27 mM.Table IIComposition of hypotonic modified Dulbecco's media used to induce IL-1β releaseComponentFormulationABCDENaCl132110825527KCl2.62.21.61.10.54KH2PO41.41.20.90.60.3MgCl20.50.50.50.50.5CaCl20.90.90.90.90.9Hepes, pH 7.32020202020NaHCO3, pH 7.355555Glucose55555 Open table in a new tab In normal Dulbecco's medium (Formulation A, Table II), LPS-stimulated cells released little mature IL-1β and the cell-associated cytokine persisted as the 35-kDa species (Fig. 1). Addition of 2 mM ATP to this medium, however, promoted complete release of the radiolabeled cytokine, and externalized IL-1β was processed efficiently to the 17-kDa species (Fig. 1). Importantly, as the concentration of NaCl within the chase medium decreased (in the absence of exogenous ATP), mature 17-kDa IL-1β increased extracellularly. Thus, in medium containing 55 (Formulation D) and 27 (Formulation E) mM NaCl, 85 and 97%, respectively, of the total radiolabeled IL-1β was recovered extracellularly as the 17-kDa species (Fig. 1). To define the kinetics of this posttranslational processing, LPS-stimulated [35S]methionine-labeled monocytes were chased in hypotonic medium for various times. After a 10-min chase, only a small quantity of radiolabeled IL-1β was recovered in the medium, and the externalized polypeptides were not proteolytically processed (Fig. 2). Extracellular 17-kDa IL-1β, however, was readily detected after 20 min of hypotonic treatment, and the quantity of this species increased during longer chase times (Fig. 2). Importantly, beyond the 20 min time point extracellular IL-1 was recovered almost exclusively as the 17-kDa species (Fig. 2). In contrast, at all times intracellular cytokine was composed primarily of the 31-kDa species with only minor amounts of the 17-kDa mature form being present (data not shown). Externalization of the mature cytokine species, therefore, occurred more efficiently than release of the pro-IL-1β polypeptide species. Moreover, only 20% of the cytoplasmic constituent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was displaced to the medium after 3-h of hypotonic treatment (Fig. 2). Thus, hypotonic stress promoted formation of 17-kDa IL-1β and selective release of this species from LPS-activated human monocytes. Hypotonically stressed monocytes (in medium containing ≤55 mM NaCl) demonstrated the same ballooned appearance as previously observed after ATP or nigericin treatment (data not shown). Although viability was not assessed, cells demonstrating this dramatically altered appearance are assumed to be non-vital. The sum of all radioactivity recovered as IL-1β (corrected for the 2-fold loss of 35S-labeled methionines that accompany formation of the 17-kDa IL-1β species) again indicated that a 4-fold over-recovery occurred during the 3-h posttranslational maturation period (Fig. 2). Since quantities of radiolabeled polypeptides are expected to decrease during the chase as a result of protein turnover, this over-recovery (relative to the amount recovered from cells in the absence of a chase) cannot reflect differences in protein degradation. Rather, the marked increase in immunoprecipitable radioactivity suggests that pulse-labeled cytokine molecules initially exist within monocyte detergent extracts as forms that are inaccessible to and/or not recognized by the antibody and are converted during hypotonic stress to forms that are recognized immunologically. To determine whether the ATP-activated IL-1β posttranslational processing mechanism also involved a volume-sensitive response, monocytes were treated with ATP in a hypertonic medium. Normal RPMI medium was made hypertonic by the addition of 0.2 M NaCl. LPS-activated [35S]methionine-labeled cells treated with ATP in this medium did not efficiently process IL-1β to the 17-kDa species nor did they release significant cytokine into their medium (Fig. 3). In contrast, cells maintained in normal RPMI demonstrated an efficient ATP response (Fig. 3). ATP-treated control cultures released 26% of their LDH into the medium, but monocytes treated with ATP in the hypertonic medium released only 15% of this cytoplasmic marker. To explore the role of anions in the ATP-induced response, LPS-activated [35S]methionine-labeled monocytes were incubated in isotonic media that contained various sodium salts in place of NaCl; chaotropic anions (I−, NO3−, and SCN−) and the membrane impermeant glucuronate anion were employed. In medium containing NaCl, monocytes demonstrated an efficient ATP response (Fig. 4); 17-kDa IL-1β was produced and externalized. In contrast, when monocytes were maintained in a NaI- or NaSCN-based medium, a marked decrease in formation and release of 17-kDa IL-1β was observed (Fig. 4). In the presence of either of these salts, production of 17-kDa IL-1β was reduced by 97% relative to cells maintained in NaCl-containing medium. Likewise, cells maintained in a NaNO3-based medium demonstrated an impaired response; 56% less 17-kDa IL-1β was produced by cells maintained in NaNO3 relative to cells maintained in NaCl (Fig. 4). When the medium contained 137 mM sodium glucuronate, on the other hand, production of 17-kDa IL-1β was not impaired; rather, cells maintained in this medium consistently produced slightly greater amounts of the mature cytokine species (Fig. 4). The percentage of LDH released by ATP was 25, 10, 9, 16, and 31%, respectively, in media that contained 137 mM NaCl, NaI, NaSCN, NaNO3, or sodium glucuronate. Thus, chaotropic anions inhibited ATP-induced processing and release of IL-1β and the release of LDH. To address the possibility that chaotropic anions impaired the ATP-induced cytokine response by blocking binding of ATP to its cell surface receptor, monocytes were treated with ATP at different times relative to the time of substitution of NaI for NaCl within the medium. When monocytes were placed in NaI either before or at the time of ATP addition, 17-kDa IL-1β production was blocked efficiently (data not shown). Likewise, when the medium substitution occurred within 15 min of ATP addition the cytokine response was inhibited by 87% (Fig. 5). When the NaI for NaCl substitution was delayed beyond 25 min of ATP addition, however, production of 17-kDa IL-1β was observed (Fig. 5). Thus, NaI blocked the ATP-induced cytokine response independently of an effect on the initial binding of ATP to its surface receptor. It should be noted that the anti-IL-1β antiserum immunocaptured radiolabeled IL-1β as efficiently from the NaI medium as from a NaCl medium; failure to recover 17-kDa IL-1β from the NaI medium, therefore, did not result from impaired immunoprecipitation. Additional evidence that the anion effect on IL-1β processing was not due to inhibition of ATP binding to its receptor was obtained by asking if chaotropic anions altered cytokine processing promoted by hypotonic stress. LPS-activated [35S]methionine-labeled monocytes were treated with hypotonic medium that contained 55 mM concentrations of the individual sodium salts. As expected, cells incubated in hypotonic NaCl produced and externalized 17-kDa IL-1β (Fig. 6). In contrast, cells maintained in hypotonic NaI produced only 5% as much 17-kDa IL-1β (Fig. 6). Production of 17-kDa IL-1β also was reduced in the presence of hypotonic NaSCN, but the extent of inhibition (<30%) was not equivalent to that obtained in the NaI-based medium. Monocytes maintained in hypotonic NaNO3 or sodium glucuronate produced quantities of 17-kDa IL-1β≥ to that recovered from cells maintained in hypotonic NaCl (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W1984672754,"S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is a key enzyme in the pathway of polyamine biosynthesis. The cellular levels of the polyamines specifically regulate AdoMetDC translation through the 5′-leader of the mRNA, which contains a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) 14 nucleotides from the cap. Mutating the initiation codon of the uORF, which encodes a peptide product with the sequence MAGDIS, abolished regulation. In addition, the uORF is sufficient, by itself, to provide polyamine regulation when inserted into the 5′-leader of the human growth hormone mRNA. Changing the amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the peptide product of the uORF abolished polyamine regulation. In contrast, altering the nucleotide sequence of the uORF at degenerate positions, without changing the amino acid sequence of the peptide, did not affect regulation. Extending the distance between cap and uORF, thereby changing the rate of initiation at the initiator AUG of the uORF, did not alter polyamine regulation. When the uORF was extended so as to overlap, out of frame, the downstream major cistron, polyamine regulation was abolished. We propose that polyamines do not modulate the rate of recognition of the uORF but rather regulate interaction of the peptide product of the uORF with its target.

When the uORF was extended so as to overlap, out of frame, the downstream major cistron, polyamine regulation was abolished. We propose that polyamines do not modulate the rate of recognition of the uORF but rather regulate interaction of the peptide product of the uORF with its target."
https://openalex.org/W2015493792,"The functional roles of Asp804 and Asp808, located in the sixth transmembrane segment of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit, were examined. Nonconservative replacement of these residues yielded enzymes unable to support cell viability. Only the conservative substitution, Ala808→ Glu, was able to maintain the essential cation gradients (Van Huysse, J. W., Kuntzweiler, T. A., and Lingrel, J. B (1996) FEBS Lett. 389, 179-185). Asp804 and Asp808 were replaced by Ala, Asn, and Glu in the sheep α1 subunit and expressed in a mouse cell line where [3H]ouabain binding was utilized to probe the exogenous proteins. All of the heterologous proteins were targeted into the plasma membrane, bound ouabain and nucleotides, and adopted E1Na, E1ATP, and E2P conformations. K+ competition of ouabain binding to sheep α1 and Asp808→ Glu enzymes displayed IC50 values of 4.11 mM (nHill = 1.4) and 23.8 mM (nHill = 1.6), respectively. All other substituted proteins lacked this K+-ouabain antagonism, e.g. 150 mM KCl did not inhibit ouabain binding. Na+ antagonized ouabain binding to all the expressed isoforms, however, the proteins carrying nonconservative substitutions displayed reduced Hill coefficients (nHill≤ 2.0) compared to the control (nHill≤ 2.8). Therefore, Asp804 and Asp808 of the Na,K-ATPase are required for normal Na+ and K+ transport, possibly coordinating these cations during transport."
https://openalex.org/W1977861693,"Autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase) induces a more than 1000-fold increase in calmodulin (CaM)-binding affinity by dramatically decreasing the off-rate for CaM. In this report, we investigate the molecular mechanism for this phenomenon by comparing the rate of dissociation of a novel fluorescently labeled CaM from two synthetic peptides and from the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of a recombinant preparation of CaM-kinase. Dissociation of a complex of CaM and CKII(296-312), a peptide representing close to the minimum CaM-binding domain of the α subunit of CaM-kinase, exhibited a fast off-rate of 5.0 s−1. This was similar to the off-rate of 1.1 s−1 for the dissociation of CaM from the nonphosphorylated form of CaM-kinase. In contrast, dissociation of CaM from either autophosphorylated CaM-kinase or peptide CKII(290-314) was extremely slow with apparent off-rates of about 3-9 × 10−5 s−1. Along with information from the crystal structure of Ca2+/CaM bound to CKII(290-314) (Meador, W. E., Means, A. R., and Quiocho, F. A. (1993) Science 262, 1718-1721), our results suggest a model in which CaM-dependent autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase induces a conformational change in the region of the CaM-binding domain which allows the formation of additional stabilizing interactions with CaM. We predict that this involves amino acids 293-298 in CaM-kinase. The possible consequences of these observations on the reversibility of CaM trapping in native CaM-kinase are discussed.

It has numerous roles in mediating cellular responses to increased intracellular Ca2+ such as alterations in neurotransmitter synthesis, ion channel regulation, regulation of cell division, modulation of muscle contractility, and modulation of gene transcription (for review, see Ref. 1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). CaM-kinase is activated by binding to the Ca2+ bound form of calmodulin, which dramatically increases the affinity of the enzyme for Mg2+/ATP, thus leading to substrate phosphorylation and phosphorylation of the enzyme itself (autophosphorylation). calmodulin CaM(K75C) IAEDANS-labeled CaM(C75) (N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine) bovine serum albumin Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II synthetic peptide representing amino acids 290-314 of the α subunit of CaM-kinase synthetic peptide representing amino acids 296-312 of the α subunit of CaM-kinase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. CaM-kinase purified from rat forebrain is a holoenzyme composed of 8-12 α and β subunits found in an approximate ratio of 3:1, respectively. The formation of holoenzymes is essential for rapid subunit autophosphorylation (2Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 3Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both inter- and intrasubunit phosphorylation occurs within a holoenzyme, both leading to distinct functional changes in enzyme behavior. Intersubunit autophosphorylation includes a site identified as Thr286 in the α subunit (2Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 3Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while intrasubunit autophosphorylation occurs at Thr305 and/or Thr306 in the center of the CaM-binding domain (2Hanson P.I.

The functional consequences of CaM-kinase autophosphorylation are well studied and include generation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity (4Saitoh T. Schwartz J.H. J.

Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2020-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Meyer et al. (14Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) discovered that autophosphorylation of CaM-kinase at Thr286 dramatically increases the affinity of the enzyme by decreasing the rate of dissociation of CaM by more than 3 orders of magnitude. This phenomenon is referred to as CaM trapping. Two possible biological roles have been proposed for CaM trapping by CaM-kinase (14Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The first involves an intrinsic effect on CaM-kinase activity as formalized by Hanson et al. (2Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This model predicts that at a certain threshold, increased frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations will produce the autophosphorylated form of CaM-kinase and thus transform the enzyme into the CaM-trapped state. Since CaM then remains bound to the enzyme for longer times, the probability of more subunits entering the trapped state is increased, sustaining a greater proportion of CaM-kinase subunits in the fully active state. A second possible biological role for CaM trapping would be to modulate the availability of free CaM in discrete subcellular locations. CaM-kinase is very abundant in brain, representing as much as 2% of total hippocampal protein (1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and it is likely that its subcellular distribution may be in excess of CaM in certain regions of the neuron where CaM-kinase is postulated to be particularly concentrated, such as postsynaptic densities (15Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 16Kelly P.T. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Conversion of CaM-kinase from a low to a high affinity CaM-binding protein has the potential to redistribute CaM in favor of binding to CaM-kinase during a period of high frequency Ca2+ oscillations and thus decrease the activity of a variety of other CaM-dependent enzymes. Studies using synthetic peptides (17Hanley R.M. Means A.R. Ono T. Kemp B.E. Burgin K.E. Waxham N. Kelly P.T. Science. 1987; 237: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Kelly P.T.

Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) provide information concerning the structural basis for enzyme regulation and CaM binding. Amino acids 281-301 in CaM-kinase encompass two inhibitory domains, one (surrounding Thr286) that binds to the ATP binding site and another (surrounding Lys-291) that binds to the substrate binding site, thus inhibiting the enzyme in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. The minimum CaM-binding domain was defined as amino acids 296-309 of the α subunit (19Payne M.E. Fong Y.-L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure of Ca2+/CaM bound to a synthetic peptide spanning amino acids 290-314 of CaM-kinase (22Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) shows that amino acid residues 293-310 adopt an α-helical structure and form stabilizing contacts with Ca2+/CaM. This suggests that the minimum CaM-binding domain (residues 296-309) does not encompass all amino acids with the potential to interact with CaM. Proteolysis studies showed that autophosphorylation of Thr286 induces a conformational change in CaM-kinase that leads to exposure of previously cryptic proteolytic sites (23Kwiatkowski A.P. King M.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5380-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Yamagata Y. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15391-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation, coupled with the peptide studies described above, lead us to hypothesize that autophosphorylation of Thr286 exposes residues on the enzyme that make stabilizing contacts with CaM leading to the CaM-trapped state. If this is true, then phosphorylation may only be required for high affinity binding of CaM within the context of native CaM-kinase, and synthetic peptides delineating different regions of the CaM-binding domain could potentially represent the untrapped and trapped forms of the enzyme. In this report, we identify two synthetic peptides that appear to kinetically mimic the untrapped and trapped forms of CaM binding to CaM-kinase, neither of which include the autophosphorylation sequence surrounding Thr286. A bacterial expression plasmid for CaM which uses the λ phage PL promoter was generated by subcloning a BglII/NcoI fragment from pOTSNcoI2 (25Shatzman A.R. Rosenberg M. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 478: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) into the plasmid pCaM23N (26Putkey J.A. Donnelly P.V. Means A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) which had been digested with BamHI/NcoI. Introduction of a single Cys residue by conversion of Lys at amino acid 75 to Cys to produce CaM(C75) was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction splicing by overlap extension (27Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of polymerase chain reaction artifacts was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells expressing CaM were grown and lysed, and a soluble fraction was prepared as described previously (28Putkey J.A. Sweeney H.L. Campbell S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12370-12378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After dialysis against 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EGTA, the soluble fraction was applied to a Macro-Prep Q 2.5 × 30-cm column (Bio-Rad), washed with the same buffer, and then eluted with a linear 0-500 mM KCl gradient. The appropriate fractions were pooled, made 1 mM in CaCl2, and loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose fast flow high-sub 2.5 × 30-cm column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was washed with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mM CaCl2 and then eluted with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mM EGTA. If necessary, CaM was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a semi-prep HPLC DEAE-5PW column (Waters). IAEDANS (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in N,N′-dimethyl formamide at concentration of 100 mM and stored at −20°C. CaM(C75) at a concentration of 2-2.5 mg/ml was made 5 mM in dithiothreitol and then desalted into 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mM CaCl2 with or without 6 M urea. IAEDANS was added in 2-fold molar excess over protein and allowed to react overnight at room temperature, followed by exhaustive dialysis against 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0. Final protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) with CaM as a standard, and the amount of bound probe was determined by absorbance spectroscopy using a molar extinction coefficient at 336 nm of 5700. Probe-to-protein ratios were 0.9 and 1.0 for proteins labeled in the absence and presence of urea, respectively. The cDNA encoding the rat α subunit of CaM-kinase lacking all of the 5′ untranslated sequence was inserted into the BakPak-9 baculovirus expression vector (Clonetech). Recombinant virus was produced in monolayers of Sf21 cells exactly as described by the manufacturer. Cloned virus stocks were used to produce enzyme by infecting Sf21 cells at a multiplicity of infection of between 2-10. After 72 h, the cells were harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80°C. CaM-kinase was purified from the cells utilizing a protocol adapted from Brickey et al. (29Brickey D.A. Colbran R.J. Fong Y.-L. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 10 volumes of 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% betaine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 mg/liter leupeptin with 10 strokes of a glass/Teflon homogenizer and clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min and then at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The proteins were precipitated from the supernatant with ammonium sulfate (50% final), resuspended in 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, with 2 mM CaCl2 and 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors and applied to a CaM-Sepharose column. The specifically bound proteins were eluted with 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM EGTA, 0.6 M NaCl, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors, again ammonium sulfate-precipitated (35% final), and the pellets following centrifugation were solubilized in 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.1% Tween 40, 0.2 M NaCl, and protease inhibitors. The solubilized proteins were layered onto a 5-24% linear sucrose gradient made in the same buffer and centrifuged for 15 h at 225,000 × g at 4°C. Gradients were fractionated and the peak of enzyme activity was determined as described previously (30Hudmon A. Aronowski J. Kolb S.J. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8800-8808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, the enzyme was concentrated from solution by binding to phosphocellulose resin, and the kinase eluted by the addition of 0.5 M NaCl was dialyzed into storage buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EGTA, 100 mM KCl, and 50% glycerol) and frozen as aliquots at −80°C. The peptide CKII(290-314) was a generous gift from Dr. Florante Quiocho and William Meador (Baylor College of Medicine). Peptide CKII(296-312) was synthesized by the Analytical Chemistry Center at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. All peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Steady-state fluorescence was accomplished at 22°C using a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorimeter. Fluorescence excitation and emission maxima for the CaM(C75)IAE were 340 and 465 nm, respectively. The excitation and emission slit widths were varied according to the particular demands of the experiment and are reported in the figure legends. Additions of individual components were made manually to a cuvette with a 1-ml final reaction volume and are as indicated in the individual experiments. The standard buffer for all fluorescence measurements was 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. CaM(C75)IAE was used at 0.06 μM. The amount of each peptide or CaM-kinase necessary to achieve a maximal increase in fluorescence was determined by sequential additions of the ligand (data not shown). Titrations of CaM(C75)IAE with ligands gave a linear fluorescence response which reached a plateau at approximately a 1:1 molar ratio of peptide to CaM(C75)IAE or CaM-kinase subunits to CaM(C75)IAE. This suggests that 0.06 μM CaM(C75)IAE is well above the binding constant for the ligands. For experiments designed to measure the dissociation of CaM from autophosphorylated CaM-kinase, Mg2+/ATP (1 mM final concentration) was added directly to the cuvette already containing Ca2+, CaM(C75)IAE, and CaM-kinase. After 1 min, a time sufficient to maximally autophosphorylate the enzyme on Thr286, 50-fold excess CaM was added and the change in fluorescence was monitored as described. In separate experiments, using this recombinant form of the α subunit, similar reaction conditions produced maximal Ca2+/CaM-independent activity (a marker for the phosphorylation of Thr286) within 30 s at 4°C. Thus, the reaction conditions are sufficient to maximally autophosphorylate Thr286 at the point of excess CaM addition. Stopped-flow measurements were accomplished using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) Model SF.17 MV sequential stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter with a dead time of 1.6 ms. Excitation was at 340 nm with 5-nm slit widths, and emitted light was collected using a 390-nm cut-off filter. Samples were excited using a 150-watt xenon lamp. Off-rates were determined by rapid mixing (17 μl/ms) of equal volumes of solutions from two syringes. Typically, one syringe contained the standard buffer with CaM(C75)IAE (0.6 μM) and sufficient peptide or enzyme to achieve maximal fluorescence intensity. The second syringe contained excess unlabeled CaM (30 μM) in the same buffer. All data were fit to a single exponential function. All fluorescence measurements were made at room temperature. The cDNA for chicken calmodulin was mutated to introduce a single Cys residue for Lys at amino acid 75. A comparison of the crystal and NMR solution structures of free CaM (31Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and CaM bound to a peptide derived from CaM-kinase II (22Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) indicated that the side chain of Lys 75 does not directly participate in peptide binding but would undergo a change in its environment upon formation of the peptide·CaM complex. Presumably, a probe bound to Cys at position 75 in CaM would not drastically influence the interaction of CaM with a target peptide or protein but would exhibit a change in fluorescence characteristics upon binding ligands. Fig. 1 shows that there is no discernible difference in the abilities of bovine brain CaM, recombinant CaM synthesized in bacteria, and CaM(C75)IAE to activate CaM-kinase. Two synthetic peptides were used in the current study (Fig. 2A). A crystal structure of the longer peptide, CKII(290-314), bound to CaM was reported by Meador et al. (22Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The underlined residues in CKII(290-314) are those which were resolved in the crystal structure. The shorter peptide, CKII(296-312), is based on the minimal CaM-binding peptide (19Payne M.E. Fong Y.-L. Ono T. Colbran R.J. Kemp B.E. Soderling T.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal extension of Gly-Cys on CKII(296-312) was included to provide a flexible site for covalent attachment of various sulfhydryl-specific probes for future studies. Fig. 2B shows the steady-state emission spectra for CaM(C75)IAE in the absence (−Ca2+) and presence (+Ca2+) of calcium. Ca2+ binding produced a 20-30% increase in the fluorescence intensity and a slight shift of the emission maxima to a shorter wavelength. Addition of CKII(296-312) to Ca2+/CaM resulted in an additional, larger increase in fluorescence intensity and a further blue shift in emission maxima. The emission maxima of 465 nm in the presence of the peptide was selected for subsequent experiments. Fig. 3 compares the effects of sequential additions of Ca2+ and either CaM-kinase peptides or CaM-kinase on the fluorescence intensity from CaM(C75)IAE. A typical increase in fluorescence intensity is detected when Ca2+ is added to CaM(C75)IAE. Addition of CKII(296-312) produces an additional increase in fluorescence similar to that shown in Fig. 2. A more robust increase in fluorescence intensity is produced by addition of CKII(290-314). This difference in fluorescence intensities induced by the two peptides suggests distinct conformations of CaM in the respective complexes. Peptide-induced increases in fluorescence intensity are inhibited by more than 97% if 50-fold excess unlabeled CaM is added prior to the addition of CKII(290-314). This would be anticipated if the affinities of CaM and CaM(C75)IAE for peptides are similar as suggested by Fig. 1. Addition of CaM-kinase (3.5 μg) also produces an increase in fluorescence intensity, although the absolute increase is smaller relative to either of the peptides. This increase in fluorescence intensity produced by the addition of CaM-kinase is similar to that reported by Meyer et al. (14Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). They further showed that the increase in fluorescence intensity was paralleled by an increase in fluorescence anisotropy. Addition of 1 mM Mg2+/ATP to the cuvette to allow autophosphorylation of the enzyme produced a second and larger increase in fluorescence, which is not seen when 1 mM Mg2+ is added to the cuvette (data not shown). The observed increase in fluorescence intensity is likely due to a combination of nucleotide binding and autophosphorylation of the enzyme and reached a stable plateau fluorescence increase within the few seconds required to open the fluorimeter, mix the sample manually, close the fluorimeter, and resume data collection. Similar to the two peptides, CaM appears to adopt distinct conformations when bound to the autophosphorylated and nonautophosphorylated enzyme. Interestingly, the final fluorescence intensity is equivalent for CaM(C75)IAE bound to either CKII(290-314) or to autophosphorylated CaM-kinase. However, in interpreting this data, it is important to note that the similarities attained in intensity changes between the peptide·CaM(C75)IAE complex and enzyme·CaM(C75)IAE complex do not necessarily indicate that they adopt the same conformations. The rate of dissociation of CaM(C75)IAE from peptides or enzyme can be derived from the decrease in observed fluorescence as bound CaM(C75)IAE is exchanged with excess unlabeled CaM. The fluorescence intensity after full exchange should approach the value for Ca2+-bound CaM(C75)IAE. Fig. 4A shows the kinetics of dissociation of CaM(C75)IAE from CKII(296-312) or CaM-kinase which is not autophosphorylated. The data fit well to a single exponential with rates of dissociation of CaM from the peptide and dephosphorylated enzyme of 5.0 s−1 and 1.1 s−1, respectively. Control experiments in which the CaM(C75)IAE·peptide or CaM(C75)IAE·enzyme complexes were mixed with buffer without excess CaM showed no decrease in fluorescence (data not shown). The presence of 1 mM dithiothreitol to reduce potential disulfide bonded dimers of CKII(296-312) had no effect on the rate of CaM exchange. Thus, the off-rate observed for CKII(296-312) appears similar to the low affinity (untrapped) state of CaM-kinase. Fig. 4B shows that the rates of dissociation of CaM from either the autophosphorylated form of CaM-kinase or CKII(290-314) were extremely slow and only partial exchange was observed after several hours. We utilized autophosphorylation conditions similar to those described my Meyer et al. (14Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), who demonstrated the CaM trapping effect was due specifically to autophosphorylation of Thr286 and not to binding of nucleotides. Exchange reactions involving the CaM(C75)IAE·CKII(290-314) complex were about 50% complete after 15 h. If the final fluorescence intensity after full exchange is defined as that observed when CKII(290-314) is added to CaM(C75)IAE in the presence of excess CaM (Fig. 4B, dotted line), then the estimated rates of dissociation of CaM from CKII(290-314) or autophosphorylated enzyme are 3 × 10−5 s−1 and 9 × 10−5 s−1, respectively. Loss of enzyme activity at room temperature precludes meaningful interpretation of prolonged incubations with the holoenzyme. Additionally, because these experiments were performed at room temperature in the sustained presence of Mg2+/ATP, it is likely that CaM-kinase underwent autophosphorylation at sites in addition to Thr286. We do not know how these subsequent autophosphorylation steps may influence the observed off-rates for CaM dissociation. Nevertheless, it is clear that CKII(290-314) kinetically mimics the trapped form of CaM binding to CaM-kinase. We have shown that peptides which span different amino acids in the CaM-binding domain of CaM-kinase have greatly different rates of dissociation from CaM. CaM binding to peptide CKII(296-312) kinetically mimics binding to unphosphorylated CaM-kinase, while peptide CKII(290-314) mimics binding to the phosphorylated/trapped state of the enzyme. We conclude that autophosphorylation of Thr286 in CaM-kinase is necessary for high affinity binding of CaM only within the context of the enzyme. Phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes in the CaM-binding region may allow formation of additional interactions with CaM that lead to a dramatic decrease in the rate of dissociation of CaM from CaM-kinase. Phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes in CaM-kinase have been demonstrated previously by differential proteolysis. Kwiatkowski and King (23Kwiatkowski A.P. King M.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5380-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that a site close to Thr286 becomes accessible to proteolysis only when Thr286 is autophosphorylated, indicating exposure of this area. Subsequently, Yamagata et al. (24Yamagata Y. Czernik A.J. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15391-15397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that limited chymotrypsin treatment cleaved CaM-kinase at Phe293 in the absence of phosphorylation and at Ile271 when autophosphorylated. Together, these results indicate that the region just N-terminal to the CaM-binding domain of CaM-kinase undergoes a conformational change of sufficient magnitude to expose the region to proteolytic attack following autophosphorylation of Thr286. Because the peptide mimics the autophosphorylated enzyme, we predict that this conformational change allows new contacts to form between CaM and CaM-kinase following autophosphorylation leading to the high affinity CaM-binding state. Our results suggest that the crystal structure resolved for the complex of CaM and CKII(290-314) represents high affinity binding of CaM to CaM-kinase. In this structure, only amino acids 293-310 form stable interactions with CaM (see underlined residues in Fig. 2A) and are seen as an α-helical rod that is enveloped by CaM (22Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Amino acids 290-292 and 311-314 are not resolved in the crystal structure, presumably because they do not interact with CaM and are free to adopt random conformations. Thus, amino acids included in the CaM-binding region as defined by the crystal structure, but which are absent in the minimal CaM-binding peptide, are Phe293, Asn294, and Ala295. It seems most probable that these residues are responsible for the difference in dissociation rates of the two peptides from CaM. If one assumes similar rates of association of CaM from CKII(296-312) and CKII(290-314), as is seen for binding CaM to phospho- and dephospho-CaM-kinase (14Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), then the difference in free energy between complexes of CaM and the two peptides would be about 7 kcal/mol. This difference in free energy could easily be achieved by the formation of several hydrogen bonds or salt bridges coupled with hydrophobic interactions. Meador et al. (22Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) showed that Phe293 and Ala295 are positioned to form hydrophobic interactions with residues in the C-terminal half of CaM. They also noted hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between amino acids 296Arg-Arg-Lys298 of CKII(290-314) and Glu residues in both the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of CaM. It is possible that these salt bridges cannot form unless Thr286 is phosphorylated and Phe293 and Ala295 interact with CaM. The results described in the present study also suggest an important potential limitation on the reversibility of the CaM trapping process. Once CaM-kinase is autophosphorylated and converted to the CaM-trapped state, dephosphorylation may not completely return the off-rate for CaM to the basal state. This hypothesis is based on the observation that the synthetic peptide CKII(290-314) kinetically mimics the trapped state and has no associated phosphate group. Once CaM is trapped, autophosphorylation of Thr286 may no longer be essential. This is not meant to indicate that dephosphorylation of Thr286 would have no effect on CaM-binding affinity. A reasonable prediction would be that an intermediate affinity may be obtained between the fully trapped (autophosphorylated) and untrapped (dephosphorylated) form of the enzyme. In either case, once established in the trapped conformation, the dominant mechanism for CaM dissociation from the enzyme would be to decrease Ca2+ concentrations. Future experiments will evaluate whether dephosphorylation of autophosphorylated CaM-kinase causes alterations in CaM off-rate of the enzyme in the presence of maintained Ca2+ levels. In summary, the data presented here, together with an analysis of the crystal structure of CaM bound to CKII(290-314) and previous studies using peptides and limited proteolysis, provide a model that can be tested for the way in which CaM-kinase transitions from the low to high affinity CaM binding, which involves the following events: 1) CaM binds to two adjacent subunits in CaM-kinase holoenzymes, which likely involves amino acids 296-310 of each subunit; 2) intersubunit autophosphorylation of Thr286 occurs following Mg2+/ATP binding; 3) a conformational change is induced in the CaM-binding region; and 4) stabilizing contacts between CaM and CaM-kinase are established, which may include hydrophobic interactions involving Phe293 and Ala295 and salt bridges involving 296Arg-Arg-Lys298.

INTRODUCTIONTranslocation of most periplasmic and outer membrane proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli occurs through the Sec-dependent pathway (1Fandl J. Tai P.C. J. Bioenerg.

SecA plays a pivotal role in protein translocation. It couples the energy of essential ATP hydrolysis to protein translocation (5Chen L. Tai P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SecA interacts with most components of the translocation machinery. It is believed that SecA binds to the membrane through interactions with SecYEG (15Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of precursor proteins to the SecA subunit of the translocase stimulates the translocation ATPase activity of SecA (18Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that SecA promotes protein translocation by undergoing ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) at SecYEG, and that this cycle is regulated by SecD/F (25Economou A. Poliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and the ATP-binding amino terminus of SecA (26Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).While SecYEG are integral membrane proteins (27Brundage L. Fimmel C.J. Mizushima S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), SecA is considered a peripheral membrane protein since it lacks any predicted transmembrane domains (29Schmidt M.G. Rollo E.E. Grodberg J. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and was found in both cytosolic and membrane fractions (9Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 30Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally believed, therefore, that SecA cycles between the cytoplasm and the membrane during protein translocation (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 31Bieker-Brady K. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3165-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, soluble SecA can restore translocation activity of membranes with depleted or inactivated SecA (11Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B.

A. 1988; 85: 8953-8957Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, extraction experiments with urea or Na2CO3 suggested that a significant fraction of SecA behaves like an integral membrane protein (30Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1L. Chen and P. C. Tai, unpublished results. Recently, Kim et al. (33Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) reported that a strain harboring a plasmid containing the secD secF locus possesses SecA almost entirely as an integral membrane form and displays normal protein translocation as measured by rapid processing of preproteins in vivo (although it is possible that only a small fraction of SecA is active which accounts for the apparent “normal” translocation). Kim et al. (33Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) suggested that the integral SecA is the catalytically active form in vivo and that, in this state, it might form a part of the reported protein-conducting channels (34Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear what fraction of SecA is active and whether this integral SecA remains active and cycles off the membranes as suggested by Economou and Wickner (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).Here, we present evidence that the integral SecA under the conditions used is indeed active and does not cycle off the membrane during protein translocation. We have determined the fate of the membrane-associated SecA during protein translocation, using membranes reconstituted from 35S-SecA and SecA-depleted inverted membrane vesicles. There were two forms of 35S-SecAs on the reconstituted membranes, loosely associated and integral. The loosely associated 35S-SecA can be replaced by excess nonradioactive SecA, and can be extracted by Na2CO3 or heparin. However, the release of this membrane-associated 35S-SecA is translocation-independent. On the other hand, a significant fraction of 35S-SecA remains on the membranes even after incubation with excess nonradioactive SecA. This fraction of 35S-SecA is integral, since it was found associated with membranes after flotation centrifugation and was also resistant to Na2CO3 extraction. After extraction with Na2CO3 or heparin, the 35S-SecA remaining on the reconstituted membranes was as active as the SecA remaining on native membranes. Proteolysis revealed that a 48-kDa domain is constantly embedded in the membranes regardless of protein translocation status. Together, these results indicate that a significant fraction of SecA is persistently embedded in the membrane and, as such, is active in protein translocation. Therefore, SecA cycling on and off membrane is not essential for protein translocation.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that there are two populations of SecA present on reconstituted membranes, loosely associated and tightly associated. Loosely associated SecA probably binds to membrane through ionic interaction between SecA and phospholipids. As a result, exchange of this loosely associated SecA is translocation-independent and such SecA could be stripped away from the membranes by the polyanionic heparin. Binding of SecA to the membrane is a spontaneous process, which can occur even on ice without ATP (Fig. 2A, and Ref. 15Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The tightly associated SecA might become inserted into the membrane. This possibly occurs through interactions with phospholipids, SecYEG (15Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 17Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7902-7907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), or other proteins so that it becomes resistant to extraction by heparin or Na2CO3. Our data are consistent with evidence reported by Cabelli et al. (30Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that in membranes isolated by chromatography in buffer, one-third of the membrane-associated SecA could not be extracted by Na2CO3. In the current studies, the integral nature of this Na2CO3-resistant SecA was further confirmed and extended by both its resistance to replacement with excess nonradioactive SecA under translocation condition, and its association with membrane vesicles during flotation centrifugation. The amount of integral SecA is about 10 μg (50 pmol of dimers)/1 mg of membrane protein, similar to the amount of SecA present on membranes from the SecA+ parental CK1801 and wild type D10 strains. Most of SecA on these native membranes is also resistant to Na2CO3 and urea extraction,1 presumably because loosely associated SecA had previously been removed by the membrane preparation procedures, which consist of a series of density centrifugation in buffer containing EDTA (38Rhoads D.B. Tai P.C. Davis B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SecA cycles on and off the membrane during protein translocation (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 31Bieker-Brady K. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3165-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, this cycling model lacks direct experimental evidence. Our data show that a significant fraction of functional SecA is embedded in the membrane during protein translocation; therefore, SecA cycling on and off membrane is not essential in protein translocation.It appears highly likely that soluble SecA can bind to membranes and a fraction becomes integrated, but that, once integrated, SecA cannot be released into a soluble form. This integral SecA might be modified or rearranged to become permanently embedded in membranes. Several different forms of SecA in the cell have been reported (46Liebke H.H. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 25Economou A. Poliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) that a 30-kDa domain of SecA becomes “protease-inaccessible” during protein translocation and that this 30-kDa fragment could become “protease-accessible” again by chasing it with excess nonradioactive SecA. Based on these data, the authors proposed a model in which membrane-associated SecA undergoes cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion during protein translocation. However, our data do not support this model in our system. Instead, we found more than six SecA fragments after proteolysis of the reconstituted membranes (Fig. 8A). Similar proteolytic patterns were also observed when native membranes (detected by immunoblot) or membranes reconstituted from urea-washed membranes and 35S-SecA were used. 3X. Chen and Tai, unpublished observations. The 28-kDa fragment observed here may correspond to the 30-kDa fragment documented by Economou and Wickner (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), since it increased in the presence of proOmpA, although the increase was much smaller (<3-fold) than reported. However, the 28-kDa fragment only accounts for a small fraction of total proteinase K-resistant SecA fragments on the membranes, and the majority of the 28-kDa fragment is in the supernatant regardless of translocation status (Fig. 8A). The differences in the proteolytic patterns might come from the different experimental conditions. Economou and Wickner (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) reconstituted their membranes by incubating 125I-SecA with urea-washed membranes on ice in the absence of ATP, and collected membranes after proteolysis by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, which may include soluble protease-resistant SecA fragments. On the other hand, we reconstituted membranes by incubating 35S-SecA with SecA-depleted membranes at 30°C in the presence of ATP, and collected the membranes by centrifugation. However, even when the reconstitution, translocation, proteolysis, and membrane collection were performed following the described procedures (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), all seven SecA fragments were still observed although the 28- and 25-kDa fragments became more prominent.3 The other difference is in the labeling of SecA. We used a uniform [35S]Met labeling in vivo, whereas Economou and Wickner (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) labeled their SecA with 125I in vitro, which labels only surface-accessible tyrosine residues. Since most tyrosine residues will be embedded in the interior of soluble SecA, and the labeling efficiency is calculated as about 1% from the published data (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), it is most likely that only 1 out of the total 25 tyrosine residues in the SecA was labeled. Therefore, only fragments containing this 125I-labeled tyrosine residue became detectable. The 66- and 48-kDa fragments may not contain the labeled tyrosine residues, thus, missing from their proteolytic patterns. However, we have no satisfactory explanation for the different observation on the 28-kDa/30-kDa fragments. It should be noted that in our hand, the 28- and 25-kDa fragments appear to be intrinsically resistant to proteinase K (1 mg/ml) upon the incubation of SecA with ATP in the presence of membranes.SecA has been proposed to function as a dimer (47Akita M. Shinkai A. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 48Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is possible that integral SecA exists as a dimer in the membranes, since it is active in protein translocation. The presence of the constant 90-kDa and the 48-kDa SecA fragments (Fig. 8A) suggests that integral SecA is deeply embedded in the membrane. Thus, it is likely that there is a fraction of SecA dimer deeply embedded in the membranes that give rise to 90- and 48-kDa fragments upon protease digestion. These domains of SecA may form a part of the protein-conducting channels (33Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 34Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Indeed, SecA has been shown to be the nearest neighbor of preproteins during translocation (49Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, SecA on the membranes may play a structural role as well as a catalytic role for protein translocation across the inner membrane. The structural role of the SecA may also provide an explanation for the findings that SecY-deficient membranes and SecE-deficient membranes are active in protein translocation in vitro (14Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 50Watanabe M. Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 61: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). 4J. P. Lian, Y. Yang, and P. C. Tai, manuscript in preparation. 5Y. Yang, N. Yu, and P. C. Tai, manuscript in preparation.Watanabe and Blobel (14Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have reported that the urea- or heparin-extracted membrane vesicles, which contained only membrane-integral SecA, were fully active in protein translocation in the presence of F1-ATPase. In addition, they showed that reconstituted proteoliposomes from detergent extracts of heparin-extracted membrane vesicles containing only integral SecA but no F1- ATPase were fully active in protein translocation. The significance of this finding, however, has been questioned (33Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), since the proteoliposomes also lack SecY, an “indispensable” component of the translocation machinery (52Nishiyama K. Kabuyama Y. Akimaru J. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1065: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To address these concerns, we carried out heparin extraction with SecA reconstituted membranes and native membranes and confirmed that the extracted membranes are active (Fig. 7). The amount of SecY is not affected by the extraction and there is no F1-ATPase in the membranes. Thus, the translocation activity of these membranes is indeed due to the integral SecA. F1 forms complex with F0 on the wild-type membrane, blocking the proton flow through the F0 channel (53Brusilow W.S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). When F1 is removed, the membranes become permeable to protons (54Hasen S.M. Tsuchiya T. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 108-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly resulting in the collapse of proton motive force and loss of translocation activity (55Ernst F. Hoffschulte H.K. Thome-Kromer B. Swidersky U.E. Werner P.K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12840-12845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restoration of translocation activity of urea-treated membranes by adding back soluble F1-ATPase (14Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) may occur through restoration of the proton motive force, which helps protein translocation under certain conditions (35Chen L. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 389-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 56Yamada H. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18577-18581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Shiozuka K. Tani K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18843-18847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we used unc− membranes, the Na2CO3 and the heparin treatments do not disrupt the proton motive force due to the F1F0 ATPase. Therefore, F1-ATPase is not required for the translocation activity of the reconstituted membranes in our system. Watanabe and Blobel (14Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also found that heparin-treated membranes containing less SecA are as active as the control membranes. However, we found that the translocation activity levels of heparin-treated membranes are lower than the control membranes, but are the same when normalized to the remaining SecA. This difference probably comes from the amount of precursor proteins used in the in vitro systems. The amount of SecA remaining on the membranes after heparin extraction may be sufficient for maximum translocation of the nascent precursor proteins whose amount is usually small. On the other hand, when purified precursors were used, there are usually more precursor molecules than SecA in the in vitro system. As a result, although adding soluble SecA to our reconstituted membranes did not enhance translocation of the nascent proOmpA (Fig. 1), it did increase the translocation efficiency when purified proOmpA was used (Fig. 4). Thus, our data support and extend these previous findings that integral SecA is active. Moreover, since each integral SecA molecule can support several cycles of OmpA translocation, SecA cycling on and off the membrane is clearly not an obligatory step for protein translocation.Whether or not cytosolic SecA plays an essential role in protein translocation is controversial. SecA has been reported to interact with the precursor proteins (22Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kimura E. Akita M. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Chun S.-Y. Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, soluble SecA/SecB complex has been detected in vivo and was shown to be involved in targeting precursor proteins to the membrane (59Hoffschulte H.K. Drees B. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, proOmpA or proOmpA/SecB complex has been shown to bind to SecA at membranes (15Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and the SecA/SecB cascade is not essential for protein translocation, since SecB only binds to a subset of preproteins. It is also known that soluble SecA is not required for translocation if sufficient SecA is bound to the membranes (11Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Watanabe M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9011-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, Kim et al. (33Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) have shown that a strain with all its SecA on the membrane displayed normal translocation of preproteins in vivo. Our in vitro data shows that soluble SecA exchanges with the loosely bound SecA regardless of protein translocation status (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). What then, is the function of the cytosolic or free SecA? One possible function of cytosolic SecA is to shuttle the SecB/precursor from cytosol to membranes. Another known function for the cytosolic SecA is in the repression of its own synthesis (60Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Jarosik G.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 311-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SecA has been shown to compete with ribosomes for the ribosome binding site of its own mRNA (61Salavati R. Oliver D. RNA. 1995; 1: 745-753PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the accumulation of preproteins when translocation is impaired could be sensed by soluble SecA, leading to the derepression of SecA synthesis (62Rollo E.E. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3281-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The increased soluble SecA levels, in turn, could compensate for the impaired Sec components, such as mutant SecY (32Fandl J.P. Cabelli R. Oliver D. Tai P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8953-8957Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 62Rollo E.E. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3281-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SecA shares sequence homology with RNA helicase (64Koonin E.V. Gorbalenya A.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and binds to a variety of preprotein mRNAs (65Dolan K.M. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23329-23333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, soluble SecA may play a more important role in the regulation of protein expression. INTRODUCTIONTranslocation of most periplasmic and outer membrane proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli occurs through the Sec-dependent pathway (1Fandl J. Tai P.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 2Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), which consists of a distinct set of Sec proteins (3Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Bieker K.L. Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SecA plays a pivotal role in protein translocation. It couples the energy of essential ATP hydrolysis to protein translocation (5Chen L. Tai P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Chen L. Tai P.C. Nature. 1987; 328: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K.

Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be essential for protein translocation both in vivo (9Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 10Oliver D.B. Beckwith J.

Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M. Moore K. Wickner W. Oliver D.

SecA interacts with most components of the translocation machinery. It is believed that SecA binds to the membrane through interactions with SecYEG (15Hartl F.-U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 16Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6600-6606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of precursor proteins to the SecA subunit of the translocase stimulates the translocation ATPase activity of SecA (18Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that SecA promotes protein translocation by undergoing ATP-driven cycles of membrane insertion and deinsertion (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) at SecYEG, and that this cycle is regulated by SecD/F (25Economou A. Poliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and the ATP-binding amino terminus of SecA (26Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).While SecYEG are integral membrane proteins (27Brundage L. Fimmel C.J. Mizushima S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), SecA is considered a peripheral membrane protein since it lacks any predicted transmembrane domains (29Schmidt M.G. Rollo E.E. Grodberg J. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and was found in both cytosolic and membrane fractions (9Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 30Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally believed, therefore, that SecA cycles between the cytoplasm and the membrane during protein translocation (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 31Bieker-Brady K. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3165-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, soluble SecA can restore translocation activity of membranes with depleted or inactivated SecA (11Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B.

A. 1988; 85: 8953-8957Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, extraction experiments with urea or Na2CO3 suggested that a significant fraction of SecA behaves like an integral membrane protein (30Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Qian L. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1L. Chen and P. C. Tai, unpublished results. Recently, Kim et al. (33Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) reported that a strain harboring a plasmid containing the secD secF locus possesses SecA almost entirely as an integral membrane form and displays normal protein translocation as measured by rapid processing of preproteins in vivo (although it is possible that only a small fraction of SecA is active which accounts for the apparent “normal” translocation). Kim et al. (33Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) suggested that the integral SecA is the catalytically active form in vivo and that, in this state, it might form a part of the reported protein-conducting channels (34Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear what fraction of SecA is active and whether this integral SecA remains active and cycles off the membranes as suggested by Economou and Wickner (24Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).Here, we present evidence that the integral SecA under the conditions used is indeed active and does not cycle off the membrane during protein translocation. We have determined the fate of the membrane-associated SecA during protein translocation, using membranes reconstituted from 35S-SecA and SecA-depleted inverted membrane vesicles. There were two forms of 35S-SecAs on the reconstituted membranes, loosely associated and integral. The loosely associated 35S-SecA can be replaced by excess nonradioactive SecA, and can be extracted by Na2CO3 or heparin. However, the release of this membrane-associated 35S-SecA is translocation-independent. On the other hand, a significant fraction of 35S-SecA remains on the membranes even after incubation with excess nonradioactive SecA. This fraction of 35S-SecA is integral, since it was found associated with membranes after flotation centrifugation and was also resistant to Na2CO3 extraction. After extraction with Na2CO3 or heparin, the 35S-SecA remaining on the reconstituted membranes was as active as the SecA remaining on native membranes. Proteolysis revealed that a 48-kDa domain is constantly embedded in the membranes regardless of protein translocation status. Together, these results indicate that a significant fraction of SecA is persistently embedded in the membrane and, as such, is active in protein translocation. Therefore, SecA cycling on and off membrane is not essential for protein translocation."

Significant Na+-independent 86Rb+ uptake was observed only when αC was coexpressed with one of the β-subunits. The expressed αCβ1 and αCβG complexes were not inhibited by Sch-28080, were only partially sensitive to ouabain (IC50 = 400-600 μM, in the presence of external 1 mM KCl), and exhibited comparable K+ activation kinetics. Coexpression of αC with epitope-tagged βG or β1, followed by immunopurification of the αβ complexes, confirmed stable assembly of αCβG and αCβ1 complexes. Since the β1-subunit, but not the α1-subunit, of Na+,K+-ATPase is expressed in the apical membrane of rat colonocytes, our data support the view that, in rat distal colon, the β1-subunit may play a surrogate role as the β-subunit for the colonic H+,K+-ATPase.

https://openalex.org/W1984992931,"To examine the specificity of MEKs for MAP kinase family members, we determined the abilities of several MEK isoforms to phosphorylate mutants of the MAP kinase ERK2 and the related kinase ERK3 which are modified in the phosphorylation loop. The ERK2 mutants included mutations of the two phosphorylation sites, mutations of the acidic residue between these two sites, and mutations that shorten the length of this loop. All mutants were tested for phosphorylation by six mammalian MEKs and compared with several wild type MAP kinases. MEK1 and MEK2 phosphorylate a majority of the ERK2 mutants. MEK2 but not MEK1 will phosphorylate ERK3. Alteration of the residue between the two phosphorylation sites neither dramatically affected the activity of MEK1 and MEK2 toward ERK2 nor conferred recognition by other MEKs. Likewise, reduction of the length of the phosphorylation loop only partially reduces recognition by MEK1 and MEK2 but does not promote recognition by other MEKs. Thus other yet to be identified factors must contribute to the specificity of MEK recognition of MAP kinases.

MEK2 but not MEK1 will phosphorylate ERK3. Alteration of the residue between the two phosphorylation sites neither dramatically affected the activity of MEK1 and MEK2 toward ERK2 nor conferred recognition by other MEKs. Likewise, reduction of the length of the phosphorylation loop only partially reduces recognition by MEK1 and MEK2 but does not promote recognition by other MEKs. Thus other yet to be identified factors must contribute to the specificity of MEK recognition of MAP kinases."

INTRODUCTIONThe function of the nervous system depends on the highly specific pattern of connections formed between neurons during development. The specificity of these connections requires neurite extension toward the correct targets guided by the growth cone and refinement and remodeling of the initial pattern of connections, referred to as synaptic plasticity, that are dependent on patterns of synaptic activity (1Goodman C.S. Shatz C.J. Cell. 1993; 10: 77-98Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The growth cone receives several kinds of environmental signals, such as diffusible chemoattractants and chemorepellants, extracellular matrix components, and cell adhesion molecules (2Keynes R. Cook G.M.W. Cell. 1995; 83: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and then it interprets them and changes shape and motility that results in the advance, turning, or collapse of the growth cone. The Rho family of small GTPases, Rac, CDC42, and Rho, has been shown to be involved in morphological changes of a variety of cells (3Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, Rac or CDC42 appears to be required for the outgrowth of neurites while Rho is required for their retraction (4Jalink K. Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S.

PGE2 has several important functions in the nervous system, such as generation of fever (6Milton A.S. Wendlandt S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1970; 207: 76-77Google Scholar, 7Stitt J.T. Yale J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1981; 69: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although cyclooxygenase products including PGE2 have been suggested to be involved in regulation of memory consolidation (12Hölscher C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 294: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the biological significance of PGE2 in synaptic plasticity is not yet understood. PGE2 acts on cell surface receptors to exert its actions (13Negishi M. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). PGE receptors are pharmacologically divided into four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, on the basis of their responses to various agonists and antagonists (14Coleman R.A. Kennedy I. Humphrey P.P.A.

We have recently cloned the four subtypes of mouse PGE receptors and demonstrated that they are heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled rhodopsin-type receptors (16Watabe A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7759-7762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these subtypes, the EP3 receptor was most abundant in the brain and was specifically localized to the neurons (20Sugimoto Y. Shigemoto R. Namba T. Negishi M. Mizuno N. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).PC12 cells were derived from rat pheochromocytomas, expressing a chromaffin-like phenotype, and serve as a useful model system for the study of neuronal differentiation. When PC12 cells are exposed to NGF for several days, they acquire many features of sympathetic neurons, such as an outgrowth of neurites. We recently isolated four EP3 receptor isoforms (EP3A, EP3B, EP3C, and EP3D) from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells that are produced through alternative splicing (21Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). To assess the role of the EP3 receptors in the nervous system, we introduced the cDNA for the EP3B receptor isoform, the most abundant isoform, into PC12 cells. In this report, we show that the activation of the EP3B receptor causes neurite retraction via small GTPase Rho.DISCUSSIONInformation on the function of the EP3 receptors in the nervous system is scarce, although several findings have been reported, for example, they inhibit neurotransmitter release and have hyperalgesic effects (28Exner H.J. Schlicker E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Kumazawa T. Mizumura K. Koda H. Brain Res. 1993; 632: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we described a new possible function of the EP3 receptors, modulation of a neuronal morphological change through a novel pathway distinct from adenylate cyclase inhibition or protein kinase C activation. In the EP3B receptor-expressing PC12 cells differentiated with NGF, M&B28767 induced neurite retraction. However, in the untransfected cells, no morphological change was caused by the agonist, indicating that M&B28767-induced neurite retraction is mediated by EP3B receptor.Growing evidence suggests that Rho plays a key role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The functions of Rho have been explored using the C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates the Rho protein (26Aktories K. Weller U. Chhatwal G.S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies using C3 exoenzyme demonstrated that Rho is involved in the control of cell shape, adhesion, and motility by regulating the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts (3Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), and it is also involved in neurite retraction in neuronal cells (4Jalink K. Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Since microinjection into the EP3B receptor-expressing cells with the C3 exoenzyme completely inhibited M&B28767-induced neurite retraction (Fig. 7, A and B), Rho was shown to be an essential element in the EP3B receptor-mediated neurite retraction.Among classical second messenger pathways, the EP3B receptor is coupled to adenylate cyclase inhibition through Gi in PC12 cells, but the receptor stimulates neither adenylate cyclase nor phospholipase C, indicating that the EP3B receptor is exclusively coupled to Gi. However, neurite retraction mediated by this receptor was not suppressed by PT treatment (Fig. 3 and Table I), indicating that this action is not mediated by Gi. These observations suggest that the EP3B receptor is coupled to Gi, which inhibits adenylate cyclase, and to a PT-insensitive heterotrimeric G protein other than Gs or Gq that induces neurite retraction dependent on Rho activity. It has recently been reported (30Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) that GTPase-deficient constitutively activated Gα12 and Gα13 stimulate Rho-dependent stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in Swiss 3T3 cells. As G12 and G13 are PT-insensitive G proteins, we suggest that the EP3B receptor may regulate neuronal morphology through G12 or G13.Protein kinase C is also thought to be involved in the regulation of cell shape, contraction, and motility (31Takai Y. Sasaki T. Tanaka K. Nakanishi H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and it has recently been reported (32Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar) that protein kinase C activation induced membrane ruffling and translocation of activated Rho to the membrane ruffling area. We have shown here that protein kinase C activation also induced neurite retraction within 60 min in EP3B receptor-expressing PC12 cells (Fig. 5, C and D, and Table II). Long term exposure to TPA suppressed the TPA-induced neurite retraction by down-regulating protein kinase C (Fig. 5, G and H, and Table II). In contrast, long term exposure to TPA did not prevent M&B28767-induced neurite retraction (Fig. 5, E and F, and Table II), indicating that EP3 receptor induces neurite retraction through a mechanism not involving the protein kinase C pathway. Both M&B28767- and TPA-induced neurite retractions were sensitive to the C3 exoenzyme (Fig. 7), indicating that these effects are mediated by Rho activation. Thus, there are two different signaling pathways, protein kinase C-dependent and -independent pathways, involved in Rho-mediated neurite retraction. TPA-induced neurite retraction was preceded by a lag period (5-10 min), while the EP3B receptor activation induced neurite retraction without a lag period (Fig. 6). Thus, the EP3B receptor-mediated retraction is faster than that mediated by the protein kinase C pathway. This finding shows that the intermediate pathways from the EP3B receptor to Rho and from the protein kinase C to Rho differ, and the latter requires a longer time to activate Rho. It has recently been reported (4Jalink K. Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) caused neurite retraction dependent on Rho activity in N1E-115 cells as well as in PC12 cells and that the LPA-induced neurite retraction was mediated by Gq-coupled phospholipase C stimulation and subsequent protein kinase C activation (33Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebök À. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the time course of LPA-induced neurite retraction in PC12 cells appears to be slower than the EP3B receptor-mediated retraction but similar to that of TPA-induced retraction (34Dyer D. Tigyi G. Miledi R. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 14: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that LPA induces neurite retraction through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway, while the EP3B receptor induces neurite retraction through a protein kinase C-independent pathway. Thus, there are two different types of heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors that induce Rho-dependent neuronal morphological change. One type is Gq-phospholipase C-coupled receptors, and the other is coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein other than Gq, leading to Rho-dependent action.Our examination of the regulation of the EP3B receptor-mediated neurite retraction by protein kinase A revealed that the activation of protein kinase A inhibited the EP3B receptor-mediated neurite retraction and indicated that protein kinase A is a negative regulator. As the potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site is located in the first cytoplasmic loop of the EP3B receptor, it is possible that protein kinase A phosphorylates the EP3B receptor. The phosphorylation of this site by protein kinase A may stop the EP3B receptor-mediated signaling. The second possible site of the action of protein kinase A is on a downstream component. LPA-induced neurite retraction was recently reported (35Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebök À. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to be prevented by pretreatment with Bt2cAMP in PC12 cells. Furthermore, it was recently reported (36Lang P. Gesbert F. Carmagnat M.D. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) that protein kinase A directly phosphorylated Rho, and this phosphorylation resulted in termination of Rho signaling. As LPA and the EP3B receptors use different pathways to activate Rho, protein kinase A may block Rho-mediated morphological regulation by phosphorylating Rho in PC12 cells.From this study, we propose new possible functions of PGE2 acting through the EP3 receptors in the nervous system. We previously showed that EP3 receptors were expressed in a variety of neurons in the brain (20Sugimoto Y. Shigemoto R. Namba T. Negishi M. Mizuno N. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (37Oida H. Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Ohishi H. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2828-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PGE2 is normally produced in the brain, and its production is dramatically stimulated by brain injuries such as concussion, trauma, and asphyxia (38Ment L.R. Stewart W.B. Duncan C.C. Pitt B.R. Cole J. J. Neurosurg. 1987; 67: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Shohami E. Shapira Y. Sidi A. Cotev S. J. Cereb.

Neurotrauma. 1989; 6: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When the brain is injured, newly synthesized PGE2 may retract the neurites of the EP3 receptor-expressing neurons and reorganize damaged neuronal connections. In addition, the levels of PGE2 are also increased in the brain by synaptic activity or during development (42Hertting G. Seregi A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 559: 84-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cyclooxygenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in PG synthesis, has been reported to be markedly induced by seizures or N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent synaptic activity, especially in the cortex and hippocampus (43Yamagata K. Andreasson K.I. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 371-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) where EP3 receptors are highly expressed (20Sugimoto Y. Shigemoto R. Namba T. Negishi M. Mizuno N. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). PGE2 may be involved in refining and remodeling the initial neuronal connections through EP3 receptors.In conclusion, in this report we have shown that the EP3B receptor elicits neurite retraction in a Rho-dependent fashion. This study will contribute not only to the understanding of neuronal PGE2 function but will also help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction pathways between heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors and Rho.

https://openalex.org/W1990192121,"In maize, a small multigene family encodes the cytosolic isoforms of glutamine synthetase (GS), and five cDNAs, designated pGS1a, pGS1b, pGS1c, pGS1d, and pGS1e, have been cloned (Sakakibara, H., Kawabata, S., Takahashi, H., Hase, T., and Sugiyama, T.

This report describes the identification and enzymatic characterization of the cytosolic isoforms of GS in maize roots, namely GS1 and GSr. The purified isoforms, as well as recombinant enzymes that had been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, were analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, and GS1 and GSr were identified as the products of the GS1a/GS1b and GS1c/GS1d genes, respectively. Upon the addition of ammonia to the culture medium, significant amounts of GSr accumulated and a preferential increase in GS synthetase activity, as compared to GS transferase activity, was found in the root extract. Assays with the purified recombinant enzymes confirmed that the specific biosynthetic and synthetase activities of GSr were 1.6-fold higher than those of GS1. Marked differences in stability were also found between the two isoforms: GSr was more sensitive to heat than GS1 and octameric aggregates of the subunits of GSr were easily dissociated to monomers than those of GS1 at low concentrations of Mn2+ and Mg2+ ions. These characteristics of the ammonia-induced isoform of GS seem to be physiologically important for the primary assimilation of external ammonia by roots.

Assays with the purified recombinant enzymes confirmed that the specific biosynthetic and synthetase activities of GSr were 1.6-fold higher than those of GS1. Marked differences in stability were also found between the two isoforms: GSr was more sensitive to heat than GS1 and octameric aggregates of the subunits of GSr were easily dissociated to monomers than those of GS1 at low concentrations of Mn2+ and Mg2+ ions. These characteristics of the ammonia-induced isoform of GS seem to be physiologically important for the primary assimilation of external ammonia by roots."

The protein tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase, or FAK, is linked to integrin signaling and interacts with several molecules involved in signal transduction. Here we report that exposure of fibroblast cells to extracellular matrix proteins activates the p70/p85 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) pathway in a ligand dependent manner. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or FRAP (FKBP 12/rapamycin-associated protein) blocks integrin-mediated activation of S6K. In contrast to the integrin-directed activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, cytochalasin D treatment does not inhibit S6K activation. Treatment with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein completely blocks S6K activation, indicating a requirement for tyrosine kinase activity. Overexpression of the COOH-terminal noncatalytic domain of FAK, FRNK (FAK-related non-kinase) in chick embryo cells results in a significant reduction in the integrin-mediated activation of S6K and a concomitant reduction in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. These results indicate at least a partial requirement for FAK in the S6K activation pathway.

It has been speculated that Rap antagonizes Ras transformation through the formation of nonproductive complexes with critical Ras effector targets. To understand further the distinct biological functions of these two closely related proteins, we searched for Rap1b-binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening. We identified multiple clones that encode the COOH-terminal sequences of a protein that shares sequence identity with RalGDS and RGL, which we have designated RGL2. A 158-amino acid COOH-terminal fragment of RGL2 (RGL2 C-158) bound to Ras superfamily proteins which shared identical effector domain sequences with Rap1 (Ha-Ras, R-Ras, and TC21). RGL2 C-158 binding was impaired by effector domain mutations in Rap1b and Ha-Ras. Furthermore, RGL2 C-158 bound exclusively to the GTP-, but not the GDP-bound form of Ha-Ras. Finally, coexpression of RGL2 C-158 impaired oncogenic Ras activation of transcription from a Ras-responsive promoter element and focus-forming activity in NIH 3T3 cells. We conclude that RGL2 may be an effector for Ras and/or Rap proteins.

The acid residues were converted into their corresponding acid amides. Sf9 cells were used as the expression system using a baculovirus with coding sequences for the α- and β-subunits of H+,K+-ATPase behind two different promoters. Both subunits of all mutants were expressed like the wild type enzyme in intracellular membranes of Sf9 cells as indicated by Western blotting experiments, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and confocal laser scan microscopy studies. The mutants D824N, E834Q, E837Q, and D839N showed no 3-(cyanomethyl)-2-methyl-8(phenylmethoxy)-imidazo[1,2a]pyridine (SCH 28080)-sensitive ATP dependent phosphorylation capacity. Mutants E795Q and E820Q formed a phosphorylated intermediate, which, like the wild type enzyme, was hydroxylamine-sensitive, indicating that an acylphosphate was formed. Formation of the phosphorylated intermediate from the E795Q mutant was similarly inhibited by K+ (I50 = 0.4 mM) and SCH 28080 (I50 = 10 nM) as the wild type enzyme, when the membranes were preincubated with these ligands before phosphorylation. The dephosphorylation reaction was K+-sensitive, whereas ADP had hardly any effect. Formation of the phosphorylated intermediate of mutant E820Q was much less sensitive toward K+ (I50 = 4.5 mM) and SCH 28080 (I50 = 1.7 μM) than the wild type enzyme. The dephosphorylation reaction of this intermediate was not stimulated by either K+ or ADP. In contrast to the wild type enzyme and mutant E795Q, mutant E820Q did not show any K+-stimulated ATPase activity. These findings indicate that residue Glu820 might be involved in K+ binding and transition to the E2 form of gastric H+,K+-ATPase.

https://openalex.org/W2003091202,"Cat-1 is a protein with a dual function, a high affinity, low capacity cationic amino acid transporter of the y+ system and the receptor for the ecotropic retrovirus. We have suggested that Cat-1 is required in the regenerating liver for the transport of cationic amino acids and polyamines in the late G1 phase, a process that is essential for liver cells to enter mitosis. In our earlier studies we had shown that the cat-1 gene is silent in the quiescent liver but is induced in response to hormones, insulin, and glucocorticoids, and partial hepatectomy. Here we demonstrate that cat-1 is a classic delayed early growth response gene in the regenerating liver, since induction of its expression is sensitive to cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis is required. The peak of accumulation of the cat-1 mRNA (9-fold) by 3 h was not associated with increased transcriptional activity of the cat-1 gene in the regenerating liver, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of expression of this gene. Induction of the cat-1 gene results in the accumulation of two mRNA species (7.9 and 3.4 kilobase pairs (kb)). Both mRNAs hybridize with the previously described rat cat-1/2.9-kb cDNA clone. However, the 3′ end of a longer rat cat-1 cDNA (rat cat-1/6.5-kb) hybridizes only to the 7.9-kb mRNA transcript. Sequence analysis of this clone indicated that the two mRNA species result from the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. The 6.5-kb clone contains a number of AT-rich mRNA destabilizing sequences which is reflected in the half-life of the cat-1 mRNAs (90 min for 7.9-kb mRNA and 250 min for 3.4-kb mRNA). Treatment of rats with cycloheximide superinduces the level of the 7.9-kb cat-1 mRNA in the kidney, spleen, and brain, but not in the liver, suggesting that cell type-specific labile factors are involved in its regulation. We conclude that the need for protein synthesis for induction of the cat-1 mRNA, the short lived nature of the mRNAs, and the multiple sites for regulation of gene expression indicate a tight control of expression of the cat-1 gene within the regenerating liver and suggest that y+ cationic amino acid transport in liver cells is regulated at the molecular level.

Cationic amino acids lysine, ornithine, and arginine are transported into cells through several transport systems that differ in their requirement for Na+ (1White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4450-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Na+-independent cationic amino acid transport is mediated by the y+ and bo,+ systems (2Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Transporters of the Na+-independent y+ system span the cellular membrane multiple times, whereas members of the bo,+ system may span the membrane once and therefore are considered as accessory proteins (3Kakuda D.K. MacLeod C.L. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 93-108PubMed Google Scholar). A number of extensive reviews on amino acid transport systems have been published (1White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol.

In the liver, system y+ is of particular importance, since the activity of the transporter may represent the rate-limiting step in the conversion of arginine to urea by the hepatic arginase (1White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4450-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of dietary arginine in the urea cycle has been demonstrated in the cat, where restriction of arginine from the diet leads to hyperammonemic coma (5Morris J.G. Rogers Q.R. Science. 1978; 199: 431-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). System y+ activity is absent in the quiescent liver, therefore protecting the plasma pool of arginine from the hepatic arginase (1White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol.

Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of expression of the two genes in the liver is in agreement with earlier studies by Christensen and co-workers (1White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4450-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that normal hepatocytes lack y+ cationic amino acid transport except under conditions where the substrate concentration exceeds the level found in systemic plasma. Therefore, lack of cat-1 gene expression in the liver protects plasma arginine from degradation from the hepatic arginase, and Cat-2a enables removal of excess circulating cationic amino acids. Although quiescent liver cells do not have an active high affinity y+ transport system (1White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4450-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transport of cationic amino acids into liver cells is induced in dividing primary hepatocytes and in transformed hepatoma cells (2Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This induction is accompanied by the accumulation of high levels of cat-1 mRNAs (2Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 6Yoshimoto T. Yoshimoto E. Meruelo D. J.

In our earlier studies, we noted that the expression of the rat cat-1 gene is induced in the late G1 phase of the regenerating liver (24Wu J.Y Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following liver injury, a large amount of extracellular basic amino acids and polyamines are required for protein synthesis and other growth-related processes before liver cells enter mitosis. During the prereplicative phase of the regenerating liver cells, early and delayed early response genes are induced (33Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 34Steer C.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) in order to provide hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells with the cellular components necessary for growth. We demonstrate in this paper that cat-1 is a delayed early response gene implicating this transporter as a growth response gene. Transport of cationic amino acids through the system y+ has been demonstrated in different mammalian cells (2Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D.A. Annu. Rev.

In the rat, two RNA species of 7.9 and 3.4 kb have been found (13Closs E.I. Rinkes I.H.M.B Bader A. Yarmush M.L. Cunningham J.M. J.

The relative concentration of the two mRNAs is regulated by cell density (24Wu J.Y Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3.4-kb transcript has been shown to correspond to a 2.9-kb cDNA clone that was isolated from a rat hepatoma cDNA library (24Wu J.Y Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J.

In addition, we report the molecular sites of regulation of expression of the cat-1 gene in rat tissues and hepatoma cells. All DNA modifying enzymes and nucleotides were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [35S]ATP (1000Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Restriction enzymes were used as specified by the manufacturer. A size-fractionated adult rat intestinal cDNA library was screened using the mouse Ecor cDNA (17Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D.

Plasmids were purified by CsCl and then sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and either internal oligonucleotide primers or the T7 and T3 primers within the vector. The following probes were used in this study. (i) cat-1/2.9, a 2.9-kb insert of the rat cat-1 cDNA (24Wu J.Y Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

(viii) c-myc, mouse cDNA, purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC No 41029). The probes were labeled using the random priming kit from Boehringer Mannheim, and the specific activities were 108-109 cpm/μg DNA. Hepatectomy (70%) was performed at 10 a.m., on Sprague-Dawley male rats (50 g) by removal of the median and left lateral lobes. Cycloheximide-treated rats were injected intraperitoneally with 40 mg/kg body weight cycloheximide in saline, 1/2 h before hepatectomy. Animals were sacrificed at the times given, and the livers, kidneys, spleens, and brains were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C until required. RNA was purified and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (40Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen liver tissue pieces or tissue culture cells were taken and placed into 4 M guanidine thiocyanate buffer (4 M GTC, 0.5% sarcosyl, 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0). The samples were immediately homogenized. The homogenate was then loaded onto a cushion of CsCl (5.7 M CsCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) and spun at 175,000 × g for 16 h. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in Hepes buffer (10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 0.3 M sodium acetate. The precipitate was then dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and samples were immediately frozen at −80°C until required. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT), as described previously (40Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). For Northern blots, samples containing 25 μg of total RNA were denatured using methyl mercury (15 mM methyl mercury, 1% SDS, borate buffer, 15% glycerol) and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. RNA was transferred onto GeneScreen Plus and probed in hybridization buffer (0.25 M NaCl, 0.25 M sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 7% SDS, 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 1 mg/ml milk, 50% deionized formamide) at 42°C. Blots were washed in 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC (15 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM sodium citrate). FTO2B cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine and 5% bovine serum. The cells were transferred to serum-containing media or media containing 10 μg/ml actinomycin D and incubated for the time points indicated. RNA was isolated, and poly(A)+ RNA was purified and analyzed by Northern blot analysis. The half-life of the mRNAs was estimated by scanning the autoradiograms. Different timed autoradiographs were used for quantitation, per experiment, to ensure that the exposures were within the linear range of the x-ray film. The PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) was also used for quantitation of the hybridized material on the Northern blots. The pattern of hybridization with GAPDH was used to normalize the loading of the RNA on the Northern blot. Nuclei were prepared from rat livers as described previously (36Groot C.J. van Zonneveld A.J. Mooren P.G. Zonneveld D. van denDool A. van den Bogaert A.J.W. Lamers W. Moorman A. Charles R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh liver tissues were homogenized in homogenization buffer (15 mM Hepes, 60 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 5 mM DTT) containing 0.3 M sucrose. The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation through a cushion of homogenization buffer, and the recovered nuclei were washed, suspended, counted, and stored in transcription buffer. Nuclear run-on assays were performed by the following method. 200 μl of frozen nuclei (2 × 107 nuclei) were added to 200 μl of reaction mix (25% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 M KCl, 1.2 mM ATP, 0.6 mM GTP, 0.6 mM CTP). This mixture, after the addition of 80 units of RNase inhibitor and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, was incubated at room temperature for 45 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of RNase-free DNase I and 10% (v/v) 10 mM CaCl2. This was incubated at 37°C for 30 min after which 40 μl of 10 × SET buffer (5% SDS, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0), 20 μl of 2 mg/ml proteinase K, and 10 μl of 10 mg/ml yeast tRNA were added. The reactions were then incubated at 37°C for 30 min, extracted with 1 ml of RNazol-B mixed with 10% (v/v) chloroform, and then precipitated with isopropyl alcohol at −20°C. Finally, the purified and washed RNA was dissolved in 100 μl of 0.5% SDS. The radiolabeled RNA from each sample was denatured and hybridized to dot blots containing 5 μg of purified cDNA fragments or total rat genomic DNA immobilized onto nitrocellulose paper. Blots were hybridized for 72 h at either 45 or 65°C in 1 ml of hybridization buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 M sodium phosphate, and 7% SDS. The optimum temperature for hybridization for the different cDNAs was evaluated. We used 45°C for the cat-1 cDNAs and 65°C for the PEPCK and c-fos cDNAs. The blots were washed with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45°C for 1 h and exposed to film. The transcription of the PEPCK and c-fos genes was measured as the positive control for transcriptional activation of early response genes in the regenerating liver and after the inhibition of protein synthesis. The vector pBluescript served as the negative control, and the genomic DNA was used to normalize the efficiency of the nuclear run-off reactions in each sample. The rate of transcription of the cat-1, PEPCK, and c-fos genes was quantified by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms. The efficiency of transcription of the nuclei at different time points of liver regeneration was normalized against transcription of total rat genomic DNA. Since transcription of many genes is regulated during liver regeneration, the choice of genomic DNA was more reliable and gave us reproducible data. The fold induction of transcription over control (zero time point) was estimated as the ratio of the individual DNA autoradiographic signals over the signal of total rat genomic DNA. Scanning of autoradiographs was performed using the CS SCAN 5000 densitometer. Different timed autoradiographs were used for quantitation, per experiment, to ensure that the exposures were within the linear range of the x-ray film. The PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) was also used for quantitation of the hybridized material on the blots. The orchestrated expression of genes in the regenerating liver following partial hepatectomy is required for the transition of liver cells from quiescence to growth (34Steer C.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The genes induced in this transition are called immediate early response genes, and their induction occurs in the absence of protein synthesis (32Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1994; 202: 1058-1060Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A second group of genes, called delayed early response genes, are induced between 3 and 24 h post-hepatectomy, and their expression depends on protein synthesis (33Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, proteins encoded by the immediate early response genes may help control progression through the cell cycle, whereas proteins encoded by the delayed early response genes may be involved in the synthesis of cellular components required for the doubling of the cellular mass (33Haber B.A. Mohn K.L. Diamond R.H. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Expression of the cat-1 gene in the rat peaks between 2 and 6 h following 70% partial hepatectomy, whereas expression of c-jun, an immediate early response gene, appears at 5 min (Fig. 1A). Expression of the genes involved in gluconeogenesis, PEPCK, and TAT also increases following partial hepatectomy (Fig. 1A) in order for the liver to maintain glucose homeostasis and compensate for the loss of mass (41Mohn K.L. Melby A.E. Tewari D.S. Laz T.M. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 42Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. Tauler A. Biochem"

A half-cAMP response element site in the bsp promoter was identified as the cis-acting element that mediated the PTH response by the transient transfections with reporter constructs containing nested deletions of the promoter or a heterologous promoter containing the cAMP response element. In conclusion, these data indicate that PTH stimulation of bsp gene expression is specific to osteoblasts and mediated by changing cellular cAMP/PKA levels.

The induction of 3T3-L1 differentiation requires treatment with insulin, dexamethasone, and an agent that increases intracellular cAMP levels. Treatment of preadipocytes with cAMP-elevating agents caused an increase in scd1 mRNA concentrations. Insulin and dexamethasone had no effect on scd1 mRNA expression in preadipocytes. The increase in mRNA resulted from transcriptional activation of the scd1 gene. 8-Bromo-cAMP treatment of differentiated adipocytes had no effect on scd1 mRNA levels, suggesting a preadipocyte-specific effect. The increase in scd1 mRNA occurred maximally after 6 h of cAMP treatment and was shown to require protein synthesis. Deletion and mutagenesis analyses have localized the cAMP response to sequence within the first 250 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the scd1 gene. Treatment with phorbol ester enhanced the induction of scd1 mRNA by cAMP, suggesting the involvement of AP-2 as a mediator of the cAMP response. The induction of scd1 expression by cAMP during early differentiation was distinct from that observed during late adipocyte development. This early expression presents a novel regulated function of scd1 during the differentiation process, independent of its lipogenic role in late adipocyte development.

https://openalex.org/W2167124397,"The mammalian 5'- to 3'-exonuclease/endonuclease, called RAD2 homologue 1 or flap endonuclease 1, has a unique cleavage activity, dependent on specific substrate structure. On a primer-template, in which the primer has an unannealed 5'-tail, endonucleolytic cleavage near the annealing point releases the tail intact. Entering at the 5'-end, the nuclease tracks along the entire tail to the point of cleavage. Genetic analyses suggest that this nuclease removes DNA adducts in vivo (Sommers, C. H., Miller, E. J., Dujon, B., Prakash, S., and Prakash, L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 4193-4196). Micrococcal nuclease footprinting shows that after tracking the nuclease protects a region of the tail 25 nucleotides long, adjacent to the cleavage site. Substrates with adducts at specific locations were used to assess the mechanism of RAD2 homologue 1 nuclease tracking and its ability to cleave modified DNA. Either a conventional cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) or a bulky CDDP derivative was placed within or beyond the region protected by the nuclease. The nuclease cleaved the tail of both substrates. In contrast, a CDDP adduct just adjacent to the expected cleavage point was inhibitory. A CDDP adduct at the very 5'-end of the tail was also cleaved. The nuclease could remove tails containing adducts on the sugar-phosphate backbone. Apparently, the nuclease is designed to slide over various types of damage on single stranded DNA and then cut past the damaged site."

The isoprenoid structure is less hydrophobic than the saturated n-alkyl group with the same carbon number; therefore, the native isoprenoid side chain appears to play a specific role in quinol binding besides simply increasing hydrophobicity of the molecule. The Vmax values of 2-methoxy-3-ethoxy analogues were greater than that of 2-ethoxy-3-methoxy analogues irrespective of the side chain structure. This result indicates not only that a methoxy group in the 2-position is recognized more strictly than the 3-position by the binding site but also that the side chain structure does not affect binding of the quinol ring moiety. Systematic analysis of the electron-donating activities of the analogues with different substituents in the 5-position revealed that the 5-methyl group is important for the activity. In the parallel studies with the bd-type enzyme, we obtained similar observations except that almost all quinol analogues, but not ubiquinol-1, elicited a remarkable substrate inhibition at higher concentrations.

Madgwick S.A. Reil E. Oettmeier W. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) identified aurachin C as the potent inhibitor for both the bo- and bd-type enzymes, aurachin D and a tridecyl derivative of stigmatellin as the specific inhibitors for the bo- and bd-type enzymes, respectively. Subsequently, we demonstrated the presence and functional importance of a novel high affinity Q-binding site (QH) in the bo-type enzyme that is distinct from a low affinity Q-H2-oxidation site (QL) (13Sato-Watanabe M.

Potentiometric studies showed that the bound Q8 at the QH site can be reduced to Q8-H2 through a ubisemiquinone radical (14Sato-Watanabe M. Itoh S. Mogi T. Matsuura K. Miyoshi H. Anraku Y.

These results indicate that the QH site mediates the intramolecular electron transfer from Q-H2 in the QL site to low spin heme b (13Sato-Watanabe M. Mogi T. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Miyoshi H.

Photoaffinity cross-linking with an azidoubiquinone derivative identified subunit I as the substrate binding site (17Yang F.-D. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Lorence R.M. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14987-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-subunits I and II antibodies effectively inhibited the oxidation of quinols and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, respectively (18Kranz R.G. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7803-7998Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The epitope of monoclonal antibodies which binds to subunit I and specifically blocks the quinol oxidation was mapped to a region having a single 11-residue stretch of the large periplasmic loop V↓VI (Q-loop) of subunit I (19Dueweke T.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4273-4277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, limited proteolysis demonstrated that the cleavage of the Q-loop caused a loss of the quinol oxidase activity (20Lorence R.M. Carter K. Gennis R.B. Matsushita K. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5271-5276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dueweke T.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3401-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the Q-H2-oxidation site is localized in subunit I of the bd-type enzyme. Structure-function studies with quinone analogues have demonstrated that the E. coli bo- and bd-type quinol oxidases share a similar Q-binding site although they are structurally unrelated (11Sato-Watanabe M.

Further, the bd-type enzyme was also shown to be able to stabilize ubisemiquinone (22Hastings S.F. Ingledew J.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 24: 131-132Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The structural requirements for Q-H2 in the oxidation reaction should be tightly related to the structural features of the Q-H2-oxidation site and the reaction mechanism. Thus, a systematic set of ubiquinone analogues was used to probe the Q-mediated electron transfer systems such as mitochondrial succinate-cytochrome c (23He D.-Y. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol.

The substitution pattern of the quinol ring was fixed as for that of native Q8-H2. Therefore, the effects of substituents at all positions in the quinol ring upon the electron transfer efficiency remain obscure. On the other hand, saturated alkyl chains such as n-pentyl and n-decyl groups have been claimed to mimic the native isoprenoid side chain in mammalian mitochondrial enzymes (26Fato R. Estornell E. Di Bernardo S. Pallotti F. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2705-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Yu C.A. Gu L. Lin Y. Yu L.

Further, the electron-accepting and -donating activities of Q8-H2 and DB-H2 were found to be identical in mitochondrial succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (27Yu C.A. Gu L. Lin Y. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3897-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the side chain contributes primarily to an increase of hydrophobicity of the Q molecule to fit into the hydrophobic Q-binding site. To the contrary, the native isoprenoid tail structure was claimed to play a specific role in Q-binding at the QA and QB sites of the reaction center of Rhodobactor sphaeroides (29Warncke K. Gunner M.R. Braun B.S. Gu L. Yu C.A. Bruce J.M. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7830-7841Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) although it is unclear whether or not the above premise holds in general for the Q-mediated electron transfer systems. Thus, it is worthwhile to examine the role of the side chains of Q-H2 in the oxidation by bacterial quinol oxidases. To probe the structural features of the substrate binding site based upon structure-activity studies, we examined the effects on the enzyme activity of replacement of one of the alkyl groups (or moieties) on the quinol ring by another alkyl group. Such a structural modification inevitably alters the molecular shape while minimizing changes in the redox property of the molecule because the electronic nature of the alkyl groups is almost identical (23He D.-Y. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27885-27888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24He D.Y. Gu L.Q. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we synthesized a wide variety of alkyl analogues of Q-H2, including the compounds containing an isoprenoid side chain, and attempted to examine the effects of the side chain structures on recognition of the substituents at all positions in the quinol ring by the Q-H2-oxidation site. In addition, the structural properties of the substrate oxidation site of the E. coli bo- and bd-type quinol oxidases were compared in terms of the kinetic and potentiometric properties of ubiquinol analogues. Compounds 8 to 11 and 14 to 17 (Fig. 1) were the same samples as described previously (25Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Matsushita K. Nakagawa M. Ikeda J. Ohshima M. Adachi O. Akagi T. Iwamura H. Eur. J.

Other chemicals were commercial products of analytical grade. The quinone form of compound 2 (see Fig. 1) was synthesized from 2-methoxy-3-ethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, which was prepared by a previous method (25Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Matsushita K.

The mixture was slowly warmed up to room temperature, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The product (compound 2a) was isolated by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate:hexane, 1:20) in a 71% yield. For the retro-Diels-Alder reaction, compound 2a (1.5 g, 3.5 mmol) was heated at 80°C in vacuo for 3 h.

The purified bo-type enzyme in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate (SM-1200) (Mitsubishi Kasei Food Co., Tokyo) (buffer A) and the purified bd-type enzyme in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate were stored at −80°C until use. The bound Q8 content of the purified bo-type enzyme was 1.3-2.2 mol of Q8/mol of the oxidase. The quinol oxidase activity was determined with a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrophotometer. Measurements were performed at 25°C in 2.5 ml of buffer A containing the enzyme, and the reaction was started by the addition of quinol in an ethanol solution. The final enzyme concentrations were 0.15 and 1.0 nM for the bo- and bd-type enzymes, respectively. The reduced form of Q analogues was prepared by the method of Rieske (34Rieske J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 239-245Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The oxidase activity was measured by recording the absorbance change at 275 nm for compounds 1-4 or at 279 nm for compounds 7, 8-11, 13, and 14 with a millimolar extinction coefficient (mM−1 cm−1) of 12.3. The absorbance was followed at 264 nm for compound 5, at 268 nm for compounds 12 and 15-17, and at 275 nm for compound 13 with a millimolar extinction coefficient (mM−1 cm−1) of 18.8, 12, and 14.3, respectively. The apparent Km and Vmax values were determined by a Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis. The values were averaged from at least two independent measurements. Native Q8-H2 has two methoxy groups on both the 2- and 3-positions of the quinol ring. Nonempirical molecular orbital calculation demonstrates that the conformation of these methoxy groups affects electrical potentials of an oxidized form of quinone or semiquinone radical through conformer interconversion (35Robinson H.H. Kahn S.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4728-4731Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, a binding manner of the methoxy groups to the protein environment is expected to impose a significant influence on the Q redox reaction. To probe the structural features of the Q-binding site for the 2- and 3-positions independently, Sakamoto et al. (25Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Matsushita K. Nakagawa M. Ikeda J. Ohshima M. Adachi O.

The introduction of a bulky monoethoxy or diethoxy group was shown to be useful in discriminating these two positions by the mitochondrial Q-mediated electron transfer system (24He D.Y. Gu L.Q. Yu L.

Biochem. 1996; 237: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we applied the synthetic methods to preparations of the monoethoxy and diethoxy analogues that have a native isoprenoid side chain (i.e. compounds 2, 3, and 4) (Fig. 1). Taking Q2-H2 as a reference compound, we first compared the electron-donating activity of compounds 2, 3, and 4 (Table I). The activity of compound 2, in terms of apparent Km and Vmax values, was almost identical to that of Q2-H2. In contrast, the Vmax value of compound 3 decreased to 18% of the reference while Km was doubled. A change in the electron-donating activity of the diethoxy analogue (compound 4) relative to Q2-H2 was the same as that of compound 3. Our synthetic strategy now revealed that a methoxy group at the 2-position is recognized more strictly than the 3-methoxy group by the QL site.Table ISummary of kinetic parameters for bo-type quinol oxidase and of redox potentials of Q-H2 analoguesCompoundKmVmaxEmμMμmol/min nmol proteinmV1 (Q2H2)14171002 (3-EtO)15151033 (2-EtO)3031034 (2,3-diEtO)3231055 (5-H)243986 (5-Et)2012102759181008 (DB-H2)166331009 (3-EtO)1692510310 (2-EtO)178910311 (2,3-diEtO)180410512 (5-H)41139813 (5-Et)4352010214 (PB-H2)671710015 (5-H)676981620049817188398Q1H210318100 Open table in a new tab Subsequently, we examined the effects of side chain structures on the oxidase activity using the ethoxy analogues with two isoprenoid units (compounds 1-4) or an n-decyl group (compounds 8-11) and found that the effects of 2- and 3-substituents on the electron-donating activity were similar irrespective of the side chain structures (Table I). The order of the Vmax values were 2,3-dimethoxy ≥ 2-methoxy-3-ethoxy > 2-ethoxy-3-methoxy ≥ 2,3-diethoxy derivatives. This finding indicates that binding of the quinol ring moiety to the QL site is not significantly affected by the side chain structure. It is, however, notable that the apparent Km values of Q2-H2 and its 3-monoethoxy analogues (compound 2) were 10-fold lower than that of corresponding n-decyl analogues (DB-H2 and compound 9, respectively) while the total number of carbon atoms in these side chains is identical. In general, the hydrophobicity of the hydrocarbon tail differs significantly depending upon its structure.

J., D'Andrea, R., and Gonda, T. J. (1995) EMBO J 14, 4276-4287). To investigate the mechanism by which this mutation (I374N) acts, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to explore predictions based on a structural model of hβc. We focused on possible interactions between Ile374 and other hydrophobic residues in its vicinity and found that replacement of two such residues, Leu356 and Trp358, with asparagine resulted in constitutive activation of hβc. Hydrophilic substitutions at both of these positions and at position 374 resulted in the greatest degree of activation, as measured by the growth rate of factor-independent cells, while hydrophobic substitutions had lesser or no effects. Moreover, these “weak” substitutions appeared to synergize, since factor-independent cells expressing the double mutants I374F/W358F and I374F/L356A showed substantially higher growth rates than the single mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that Ile374 normally interacts with Leu356 and Trp358, and that disruption of these interactions results in a conformational change in hβc that leads to constitutive activity. A model relating this notion to the predicted structure and to ligand- and α subunit-dependent activation of hβc is proposed.

https://openalex.org/W1965786203,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) often exhibit antagonistic actions on the regulation of various activities such as immune responses, cell growth, and gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the mutually opposing effects of TGF-β and TNF-α are unknown. Here, we report that binding sites for the transcription factor CTF/NF-I mediate antagonistic TGF-β and TNF-α transcriptional regulation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. TGF-β induces the proline-rich transactivation domain of specific CTF/NF-I family members, such as CTF-1, whereas TNF-α represses both the uninduced as well as the TGF-β-induced CTF-1 transcriptional activity. CTF-1 is thus the first transcription factor reported to be repressed by TNF-α. The previously identified TGF-β-responsive domain in the proline-rich transcriptional activation sequence of CTF-1 mediates both transcriptional induction and repression by the two growth factors. Analysis of potential signal transduction intermediates does not support a role for known mediators of TNF-α action, such as arachidonic acid, in CTF-1 regulation. However, overexpression of oncogenic forms of the small GTPase Ras or of the Raf-1 kinase represses CTF-1 transcriptional activity, as does TNF-α. Furthermore, TNF-α is unable to repress CTF-1 activity in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing ras or raf, suggesting that TNF-α regulates CTF-1 by a Ras-Raf kinase-dependent pathway. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the CTF-1 TGF-β-responsive domain is not the primary target of regulatory phosphorylations. Interestingly, however, the domain mediating TGF-β and TNF-α antagonistic regulation overlapped precisely the previously identified histone H3 interaction domain of CTF-1. These results identify CTF-1 as a molecular target of mutually antagonistic TGF-β and TNF-α regulation, and they further suggest a molecular mechanism for the opposing effects of these growth factors on gene expression.

Growth factors transmit an extended array of regulatory information to eukaryotic cells by binding to specific receptors at the cell surface. With the identification of a great variety of growth factors and receptors in the recent years, it has become apparent that some factors often exert pleiotropic or redundant effects on target cells. For example, identical immune responses can be induced by several different cytokines acting either alone or synergistically in combinations (1Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). In contrast, other growth factors, such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGFtransforming growth factorTNFtumor necrosis factorTRDTGF-β-responsive domainTADtranscriptional activation domainPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorNDGAnordihydroguaiaretic acidCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCMVcytomegalovirusAAarachidonic acidROIreactive oxygen intermediatePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorcdkcyclindependent kinaseAP2activator protein 2CTF/NF-ICCAAT-box transcription factor/nuclear factor IGAL-DBDDNA-binding domain of GAL4MLVMoloney leukemia virusSp1simian virus protein 1. and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) are often functionally antagonistic. For instance, TGF-β and TNF-α antagonize on the regulation of nitric oxide production in cardiac myocytes (2Roberts A.B. Vodovotz Y. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. Nathan C.F. Mol.

Recent studies have indicated that both factors bind distinct cellular receptors at the cell surface of numerous target cell types. TGF-β receptor activation involves serine/threonine autophosphorylation of signaling receptor complexes (reviewed in Ref. 6Derynck R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 548-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF-α receptors have no apparent enzymatic activity, yet they may associate with a set of recently identified putative signal-transducing molecules such as TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) (reviewed in Ref. 7Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Thus, the mutual antagonism of TGF-β and TNF-α is not exerted through competition for the same cell surface receptors but involves differential regulation of specific target intracellular mediators. However, no such mediators have been identified to date, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this mutual antagonism of TGF-β and TNF-α are still unknown. Here, we have analyzed the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the procollagen gene expression by TGF-β and TNF-α. Collagen genes are well-known targets of mutually antagonistic TGF-β and TNF-α regulation (8Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14316-14321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, TGF-β has been shown to activate α2(I) procollagen gene expression in mesenchymal cells by acting at the level of transcriptional initiation (8Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This activation correlates with increased collagen production and secretion by fibroblasts during wound healing, a process that is potently promoted by TGF-β (11Ignotz R.A. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4337-4345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α is also present in the healing wounds (13Gailit J. Clark R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to down-regulate expression of the collagen α2(I) gene promoter, thereby antagonizing TGF-β action on collagen gene expression (9Kähäri V.-M. Chen Y.Q. Su M.W. Ramirez F. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. DiLiberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The mechanism of antagonistic α2(I) collagen promoter regulation by TGF-β and TNF-α is unclear at present. However, binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factors CTF/NF-I and Sp1 have been proposed to mediate hormone action (8Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 14Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggests that TGF-β and TNF-α might antagonistically regulate the activity and/or the expression of these transcription factors. Alternatively, hormone regulation might be effected on other proteins that interact with the transactivators, such as components of the basal transcriptional initiation machinery, including transcription factor IIB, the TATA-binding protein or transactivator-specific TATA-binding protein-associated factors. Consistent with the proposed key role for CTF/NF-I in the TGF-β induction of the α2(I) collagen promoter (8Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), we have recently shown that CTF-1, a member of the CTF/NF-I family of proline-rich transcription factors (16Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), mediates TGF-β-regulated transcriptional activation in NIH3T3 cells (17Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). TGF-β does not induce CTF-1 through direct phosphorylation of its proline-rich domain, suggesting that TGF-β induction is mediated by CTF-1-interacting proteins. One candidate target protein is histone H3, which interacts specifically with the TGF-β-regulated transactivation domain of CTF-1, and which interaction leads to the alteration of the nucleoprotein architecture of chromatin-reconstituted target promoters (17Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Here, we addressed the possibility that specific CTF/NF-I family members might mediate antagonistic TGF-β and TNF-α responses. Indeed, we demonstrate that CTF-1 mediates TNF-α-regulated transcriptional repression, and that TNF-α antagonizes the TGF-β-dependent induction of CTF-1 transcriptional activity in mouse fibroblasts. These effects are mediated by the extreme C-terminal portion of the CTF-1 proline-rich transactivation domain, previously termed the TGF-β responsive domain (TRD). Although TNF-α repression is mimicked by expression of genes regulating protein phosphorylation, such as the proto-oncogenes ras and raf, our results indicate that the TRD is not directly phosphorylated in response to TNF-α. Rather, our findings imply the interaction of the CTF-1 transactivation domain (TAD) with histone H3 in this regulatory process. Human TGF-β1 was purchased from Nacalai-Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Mouse TNF-α and human PDGF-BB were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Human TNF-α was from Calbiochem.

Two clones of NIH3T3 cells were used in this study: clone 63 (which contains constitutive endogenous AP-1 activity; Figs. 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7); and clone 4 (in which AP-1 is inducible by Ras and Raf expression, used in Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Both cell lines were grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation, essentially as described (17Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Plugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4.5 × 106 cells were mixed with 70 μg of total plasmid DNA and pulsed once at 960 microfarads and 250 V at room temperature, according to the instructions of the electroporator manufacturer (Bio-Rad). The contents of one pulsed cuvette were split in four, and cells were plated in DMEM plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 3-5 h. Cultures were then induced for a period of 18-40 h with either ethanol vehicle, 5 ng/ml human TGF-β, or 50 ng/ml human TNF-α, as appropriate. (The results presented in the figures have been obtained using human TNF-α). Cells were lysed in 1 × Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega Corp.), and CAT activities were determined using standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and normalized according to the activity of β-galactosidase resulting from a cotransfected internal control plasmid (CMVβgal; Clontech). The activity of the SV40 and CMV promoters was not significantly affected by any hormone or pharmacological agent used in this study.Fig. 2TNF-α down-regulates the CTF-1 transcriptional activation domain in NIH3T3 cells. In A, the TGF-β-responsive domain of CTF-1 mediates TNF-α transcriptional down-regulation. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with expression vectors for the indicated GAL-DBD fusion proteins (the various GAL-CTF1 derivatives, GAL-AP2 or GAL-Sp1), the internal control plasmid CMVβgal, and the G5BCAT reporter construct driven by five GAL4 binding sites (21Lillie J.W.

Five hours after transfection, cells were induced with ethanol vehicle or with 5 ng/ml TGF-β and/or 50 ng/ml of TNF-α, as indicated. CAT activities were determined 40 h later and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The mean values (bars, S.D.) of four independent experiments are presented, expressed as normalized CAT activity relative to that obtained with GAL 399-499 in the absence of hormones, which corresponds to a mean 45 ± 11 fold activation over the G5BCAT basal level, and was arbitrarily set to 100. In B, NIH3T3 cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with the indicated expression vectors, as in A. Cells treated with or without TNF-α for 40 h were lysed, and equal protein amounts of whole-cell lysates were analyzed for GAL4 DNA-binding activity in a gel mobility shift assay, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The relevant GAL4 fusion-DNA complexes are indicated by arrows, whereas the closed circle indicates complexes that may result from proteolytic degradation products of the GAL4 fusion proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3The antagonistic regulation of CTF-1 transcriptional activity by TGF-β and TNF-α occurs through AA-independent pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2092263949,The HIS7 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a bifunctional glutamine amidotransferase:cyclase catalyzing two reactions that lead to the formation of biosynthetic intermediates of the amino acid histidine and the purine adenine. The HIS7 gene is activated by GCN4p under environmental conditions of amino acid starvation through two synergistic upstream sites GCRE1 and GCRE2. The BAS1p-BAS2p complex activates the HIS7 gene in response to adenine limitation. For this activation the proximal GCN4p-binding site GCRE2 is required. GCN4p and BAS1p bind to GCRE2 in vitro. Under conditions of simultaneous amino acid starvation and adenine limitation the effects of GCN4p and BAS1/2p are additive and both factors are necessary for maximal HIS7 transcription. These results suggest that GCN4p and BAS1/2p are able to act simultaneously through the same DNA sequence in vivo and use this site independently from each other in a non-exclusive manner.

Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 43-111Google Scholar). The active catalytic subunits (C-PKA) phosphorylate several cytoplasmic substrates. In addition, a fraction of the C-PKA translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates nuclear transacting factors that are responsible for the activation of cAMP-induced genes (4Hagiwara M.

PKAI is soluble and widely expressed, whereas the PKAII isoforms, PKAIIα and PKAIIβ, are membrane-anchored and are particularly abundant in neuroendocrine cells (5Hofman F. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J.

This cell line has been used extensively to study the transmission and amplification of cAMP signals in different cell compartments (8Huffaker T. Corcoran T. Wagner J. J. Cell Physiol. 1984; 120: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PC12 derivative cell lines have been established after mutagenesis and selection for survival in the presence of high concentrations of cAMP (9Van Burskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These lines do not differentiate in response to cAMP (9Van Burskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In one cell line, A126, the concentration of PKAII is significantly reduced. Although A126 does not transcribe cAMP-induced genes, it differentiates when stimulated with nerve growth factor, suggesting a specific defect in the cAMP transduction pathway (9Van Burskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

It has been reported that the expression of the PKAII regulatory subunit, RIIβ, activates transcription of a cAMP-dependent promoter in these cells (12Tortora G. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18067-18070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Here we report that the inefficient transcription of cAMP-induced promoters in A126 is associated with a marked reduction in nuclear C-PKA. PKAII isoforms are present, but, in contrast to PC12, they are not found associated with membrane. We show that the simultaneous expression of the RII anchor protein (AKAP75) and C-PKA, but not of the PKAII regulatory subunit, RIIβ, activates cAMP-induced promoters to levels comparable to those found in the parental PC12 line.These data indicate that membrane-bound PKAII amplifies cAMP signaling to the nucleus and suggest that cAMP-mediated responses may be specified by the type and cellular localization of the PKA isoform.DISCUSSIONThe A126 derivative of the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line does not undergo neuronal differentiation when stimulated with cAMP. A126 cells are defective in importing C-PKA to the nucleus and in transcribing cAMP-induced promoters. This inhibition is specific for cAMP signals, since other stimuli (nerve growth factor or active Ras) are able to induce complete neuronal differentiation of A126 cells (11Damon D.H. D'Amore P.A. Wagner J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Ginty D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The data presented here indicate that the transmission of cAMP signals in A126 cells is altered at three levels: (i) total PKA is reduced, both PKAII, the main isoform expressed by PC12 cells, and PKAI are affected (Fig. 3); (ii) the dissociation of PKA in response to cAMP in vivo is inefficient (Fig. 2A); (iii) PKAII is not localized on the membranes (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). We suggest that the three phenotypes contribute to the down-regulation of nuclear C-PKA and of cAMP-induced transcription.The reduction of total PKA is caused by inefficient formation of the holoenzyme complex. Since the expression of exogenous C-PKA, but not of the R subunits, stimulates CRE transcription, it is possible that the catalytic subunit activity is defective in A126. The absence of C-PKA in unstimulated A126 implies that the synthesis of C-PKA might be decreased. This may explain the reduction of total PKA and the presence of free cytoplasmic R subunits. However, it is also possible that the overexpression of C-PKA bypasses the mutant function. DNA sequence analysis of C-PKAα from A126 did not reveal any mutation. Also the levels of mRNA were comparable in PC12 and A126. 2S. Cassano, unpublished data.The weak response of A126 PKA to cAMP is not caused by modifications of the R subunits, since direct sequence analysis and in vitro complementation of the extracts with purified C-PKA indicate that the regulatory subunits are able to bind cAMP and to release the catalytic subunit (Fig. 4). Moreover, in vitro PKA from A126 is undistinguishable from the PC12 enzyme (Fig. 2D). In A126 cells, a significant fraction of RIIα and RIIβ is cytosolic, apparently because the RII anchor protein is not present or not functional (Fig. 5). The RII subunits, accumulated in the cytosol, may bind C-PKA and may function as a sink for cAMP. This process would reduce the apparent dissociation efficiency of the holoenzyme. Titration with cAMP did not reveal significant differences in the dissociation kinetics of the PKAs of A126 and PC12 in vitro (Fig. 2D). However, A126 extracts inhibited exogenous C-PKA more efficiently than extracts from PC12 (Fig. 4). The discrepancy between the two assays might be explained by the lower sensitivity of the former.The reduction of RIIβ in A126 was not the cause of inefficient CRE transcription, since overexpression of the protein did not stimulate the transcription of of the cAMP-induced promoter (Fig. 7).Overexpression of the RII anchor protein, AKAP75, modestly stimulated cAMP-induced transcription, presumably by tethering endogenous RII subunits and PKAII to cellular membranes. The stimulation of CRE-CAT transcription by AKAP75 suggests that membrane-associated PKA amplifies nuclear cAMP signaling. This is also confirmed by the finding that the simultaneous expression of AKAP75 and C-PKA further stimulated CRE transcription and completely reversed the block of cAMP-induced CAT expression in A126. AKAP75 and C-PKA did not enhance CRE transcription in PC12 cells, which contain membrane-bound PKA (data not shown). The effects of AKAP75 and C-PKA in A126 were additive rather than synergistic, implying that two different steps in cAMP signal transmission were affected by the two gene products. Both C-PKA and AKAP75 stimulation of CRE transcription were dependent on cAMP (data not shown). It is likely that AKAP effects were mediated by PKAII and C-PKA effects by both PKAI and PKAII isoforms, because AKAP75 associated preferentially with RII subunits (15Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-469PubMed Google Scholar), while C-PKA associated with both RI and RII. At present we cannot determine whether the effects of AKAP75-C-PKA on cAMP-dependent transcription were mediated by endogenous PKAIIα or PKAIIβ or both. Although we did not detect binding of RIIα to AKAP75 in the membranes of PC12 cells, overexpressed AKAP75 can bind RIIα (15Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-469PubMed Google Scholar).These data can be interpreted as follows. The formation of PKA is inhibited by alteration(s) of C-PKA, resulting in the reduction of total PKA. Furthermore, the residual PKA in A126 cannot be properly attached to the membranes because a putative RII-binding AKAP homologue is missing (Fig. 5). In other systems, the expression of RII anchor proteins is cAMP-dependent (28Carr D.W. DeManno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If in A126 cells the expression of the anchor protein(s) is also dependent on cAMP, the down-regulation of cAMP-induced transcription would block the synthesis of this RII-binding protein. This would further reduce cAMP-induced transcription in A126.We cannot confirm a previous report indicating that CRE transcription can be activated in A126 by overexpression of RII subunits (12Tortora G. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18067-18070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither RIIα nor RIIβ alone stimulated CRE transcription under our conditions. Furthermore, DNA sequence analysis indicated that the RII subunits of A126 were identical to those of PC12.Our recent experiments show that translocation of PKA to the cytosol by overexpressing a dominant negative AKAP mutant blunts the nuclear response to cAMP (29Feliciello A.

We show that the simultaneous expression of the RII anchor protein (AKAP75) and C-PKA, but not of the PKAII regulatory subunit, RIIβ, activates cAMP-induced promoters to levels comparable to those found in the parental PC12 line.These data indicate that membrane-bound PKAII amplifies cAMP signaling to the nucleus and suggest that cAMP-mediated responses may be specified by the type and cellular localization of the PKA isoform. The biologically relevant effects of cAMP are mediated by activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (1Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

In addition, a fraction of the C-PKA translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates nuclear transacting factors that are responsible for the activation of cAMP-induced genes (4Hagiwara M.

PKA is found in two classes of PKA isoforms which differ in their regulatory subunits. PKAI is soluble and widely expressed, whereas the PKAII isoforms, PKAIIα and PKAIIβ, are membrane-anchored and are particularly abundant in neuroendocrine cells (5Hofman F. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J.

This cell line has been used extensively to study the transmission and amplification of cAMP signals in different cell compartments (8Huffaker T. Corcoran T. Wagner J. J. Cell Physiol. 1984; 120: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PC12 derivative cell lines have been established after mutagenesis and selection for survival in the presence of high concentrations of cAMP (9Van Burskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These lines do not differentiate in response to cAMP (9Van Burskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In one cell line, A126, the concentration of PKAII is significantly reduced. Although A126 does not transcribe cAMP-induced genes, it differentiates when stimulated with nerve growth factor, suggesting a specific defect in the cAMP transduction pathway (9Van Burskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

It has been reported that the expression of the PKAII regulatory subunit, RIIβ, activates transcription of a cAMP-dependent promoter in these cells (12Tortora G. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18067-18070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the inefficient transcription of cAMP-induced promoters in A126 is associated with a marked reduction in nuclear C-PKA. PKAII isoforms are present, but, in contrast to PC12, they are not found associated with membrane. We show that the simultaneous expression of the RII anchor protein (AKAP75) and C-PKA, but not of the PKAII regulatory subunit, RIIβ, activates cAMP-induced promoters to levels comparable to those found in the parental PC12 line. These data indicate that membrane-bound PKAII amplifies cAMP signaling to the nucleus and suggest that cAMP-mediated responses may be specified by the type and cellular localization of the PKA isoform. DISCUSSIONThe A126 derivative of the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line does not undergo neuronal differentiation when stimulated with cAMP. A126 cells are defective in importing C-PKA to the nucleus and in transcribing cAMP-induced promoters. This inhibition is specific for cAMP signals, since other stimuli (nerve growth factor or active Ras) are able to induce complete neuronal differentiation of A126 cells (11Damon D.H. D'Amore P.A. Wagner J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1333-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Ginty D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The data presented here indicate that the transmission of cAMP signals in A126 cells is altered at three levels: (i) total PKA is reduced, both PKAII, the main isoform expressed by PC12 cells, and PKAI are affected (Fig. 3); (ii) the dissociation of PKA in response to cAMP in vivo is inefficient (Fig. 2A); (iii) PKAII is not localized on the membranes (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). We suggest that the three phenotypes contribute to the down-regulation of nuclear C-PKA and of cAMP-induced transcription.The reduction of total PKA is caused by inefficient formation of the holoenzyme complex. Since the expression of exogenous C-PKA, but not of the R subunits, stimulates CRE transcription, it is possible that the catalytic subunit activity is defective in A126. The absence of C-PKA in unstimulated A126 implies that the synthesis of C-PKA might be decreased. This may explain the reduction of total PKA and the presence of free cytoplasmic R subunits. However, it is also possible that the overexpression of C-PKA bypasses the mutant function. DNA sequence analysis of C-PKAα from A126 did not reveal any mutation. Also the levels of mRNA were comparable in PC12 and A126. 2S. Cassano, unpublished data.The weak response of A126 PKA to cAMP is not caused by modifications of the R subunits, since direct sequence analysis and in vitro complementation of the extracts with purified C-PKA indicate that the regulatory subunits are able to bind cAMP and to release the catalytic subunit (Fig. 4). Moreover, in vitro PKA from A126 is undistinguishable from the PC12 enzyme (Fig. 2D). In A126 cells, a significant fraction of RIIα and RIIβ is cytosolic, apparently because the RII anchor protein is not present or not functional (Fig. 5). The RII subunits, accumulated in the cytosol, may bind C-PKA and may function as a sink for cAMP. This process would reduce the apparent dissociation efficiency of the holoenzyme. Titration with cAMP did not reveal significant differences in the dissociation kinetics of the PKAs of A126 and PC12 in vitro (Fig. 2D). However, A126 extracts inhibited exogenous C-PKA more efficiently than extracts from PC12 (Fig. 4). The discrepancy between the two assays might be explained by the lower sensitivity of the former.The reduction of RIIβ in A126 was not the cause of inefficient CRE transcription, since overexpression of the protein did not stimulate the transcription of of the cAMP-induced promoter (Fig. 7).Overexpression of the RII anchor protein, AKAP75, modestly stimulated cAMP-induced transcription, presumably by tethering endogenous RII subunits and PKAII to cellular membranes. The stimulation of CRE-CAT transcription by AKAP75 suggests that membrane-associated PKA amplifies nuclear cAMP signaling. This is also confirmed by the finding that the simultaneous expression of AKAP75 and C-PKA further stimulated CRE transcription and completely reversed the block of cAMP-induced CAT expression in A126. AKAP75 and C-PKA did not enhance CRE transcription in PC12 cells, which contain membrane-bound PKA (data not shown). The effects of AKAP75 and C-PKA in A126 were additive rather than synergistic, implying that two different steps in cAMP signal transmission were affected by the two gene products. Both C-PKA and AKAP75 stimulation of CRE transcription were dependent on cAMP (data not shown). It is likely that AKAP effects were mediated by PKAII and C-PKA effects by both PKAI and PKAII isoforms, because AKAP75 associated preferentially with RII subunits (15Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-469PubMed Google Scholar), while C-PKA associated with both RI and RII. At present we cannot determine whether the effects of AKAP75-C-PKA on cAMP-dependent transcription were mediated by endogenous PKAIIα or PKAIIβ or both. Although we did not detect binding of RIIα to AKAP75 in the membranes of PC12 cells, overexpressed AKAP75 can bind RIIα (15Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-469PubMed Google Scholar).These data can be interpreted as follows. The formation of PKA is inhibited by alteration(s) of C-PKA, resulting in the reduction of total PKA. Furthermore, the residual PKA in A126 cannot be properly attached to the membranes because a putative RII-binding AKAP homologue is missing (Fig. 5). In other systems, the expression of RII anchor proteins is cAMP-dependent (28Carr D.W. DeManno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If in A126 cells the expression of the anchor protein(s) is also dependent on cAMP, the down-regulation of cAMP-induced transcription would block the synthesis of this RII-binding protein. This would further reduce cAMP-induced transcription in A126.We cannot confirm a previous report indicating that CRE transcription can be activated in A126 by overexpression of RII subunits (12Tortora G. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18067-18070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither RIIα nor RIIβ alone stimulated CRE transcription under our conditions. Furthermore, DNA sequence analysis indicated that the RII subunits of A126 were identical to those of PC12.Our recent experiments show that translocation of PKA to the cytosol by overexpressing a dominant negative AKAP mutant blunts the nuclear response to cAMP (29Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A. Garbi C. Obici S. Mele E. Angotti E. Grieco D. Amabile G. Cassano S. Li Y. Musti A.M. Rubin C.S. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento V.E. J. Biol.

Development. 1992; 115: 49-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the rat ventral prostate (12Buttyan R. Zakeri Z. Luckshin R. Wolgemuth D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and run-on transcription studies suggest that this increase arises from an increase in TRPM-2/clusterin gene transcription (10Marti A. Jehn B. Costello E. Keon N. Ke Martin F. Jaggi R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1213-1223PubMed Google Scholar). In our efforts to identify transcription factors that are central to the triggering of the new gene expression that accompanies the onset of mammary gland and prostate involution, we looked for involution-enhanced DNase I footprints on the proximal promoter of the TRPM-2/clusterin gene. Our studies identify a novel twin nuclear factor 1 (NF1) binding element in the proximal TRPM-2/clusterin promoter whose occupation is enhanced during involution (see below). NF1 and CCAAT-binding transcription factor/NF1 (CTF/NF1) proteins are a heterogeneous family of transcription factors that can range in size from ~30-100 kDa (18Roy R.J. Guerin S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23861-23864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NF1s have a highly conserved N-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domain, which enables them to bind to the inverted repeat, 5′-TGG(A/C)N5GCCAA-3′ (20Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). NF1s bind to DNA as a dimer through an unusual DNA binding domain, which contains four cysteines that are essential for binding (21Novak A. Goyal N. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12986-12990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some NF1s can bind to “half-sites” where a promoter contains only one copy of the motif: TGGCA (22Borgmeyer U. Nowock J. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4295-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The characterized NF1 proteins have carboxyl-terminal proline-rich transactivating domains that are highly divergent in size and sequence. Thus, related products encoded by four different genes have been characterized (NF1-A, B, C, and X), and multiple splice variants that differ in the carboxyl terminus of three of these have been described (23Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 24Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.-U.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19065-19070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This diversity allows possible heterodimer formation (24Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.-U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and a high potential degree of selective control through NF1 binding sites. Further control of these transcriptional regulators occurs at a post-transcriptional level by regulation of NF1 mRNA stability (26Nebl G. Mermod N. Cato A.C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7371-7378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by phosphorylation (19Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol.

Commun. 1993; 192: 1424-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). NF1s have been shown to play a role in cell-specific and function-specific regulation of gene expression (28Jackson D.A.

In the mammary gland NF1s play a critical role in activating milk protein gene promoters during lactation, and the DNA binding activity of one form of NF1 has been shown to be ECM-dependent, in mammary epithelial cells (32Lubon H. Hennighausen L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2103-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 33Li S. Rosen J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21639-21644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, NF1 and the activated glucocorticoid receptor coordinately drive transcription from the murine mammary tumor virus enhancer (29Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, the particular forms of NF1 that are active in these processes have generally not been characterized. Here we report the characterization of a twin NF1 binding element in the proximal mouse TRPM-2/clusterin gene promoter, which contains a proximal high affinity binding element and a distal low affinity binding element. In the involuting mammary gland, significantly enhanced occupation of the proximal site is seen, whereas in the involuting prostate, occupation of both binding sites is induced. The enhanced occupation of the proximal element in the involuting mammary gland was associated with the de novo expression of a single 74-kDa NF1 protein. In contrast three NF1 proteins of 114, 68, and 46 kDa, which are prominent in the lactating gland are lost in involution. When midpregnant mouse mammary epithelial cells in primary culture were maintained on plastic, they underwent apoptosis, as happens in involution; under these conditions, the expression of the 74-kDa NF1 was initiated. When such cells were overlaid with laminin-rich ECM, both apoptosis and the expression of the 74-kDa NF1 was suppressed; in the presence of lactogenic hormones, the ECM-overlaid cells expressed differentiation markers, e.g. β-casein mRNA, and the 68- and 46-kDa lactation-associated NF1s. This represents the first report of an involution/apoptosis-specific NF1 and a switch in expression of NF1 proteins in the lactation/involution transition in the mouse mammary gland. A mouse TRPM-2 proximal promoter fragment was cloned by screening a genomic library with a mouse TRPM-2 3′ cDNA probe (a gift from F. Li, University of Berne) and subsequent Southern blot analysis with an oligonucleotide derived from the 5′-end of the rat cDNA sequence. The 680-bp EcoRI/PvuII mouse TRPM-2 promoter fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/SmaI restriction sites of pBS KS− to yield p(−629)TRPM-2/KS. One copy of the 46-mer oligonucleotide encoding the twin NF1 binding site from the mouse TRPM-2/clusterin promoter (−356/−309) and one copy of each of the three mutant oligonucleotides (m1, m2, and m3) (see Fig. 2A) were subcloned into the SmaI site of pBS KS− for sequencing and labeling for footprinting analysis. Gifts of four anti-NF1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the conserved amino-terminal DNA binding domain were obtained: against a bacterially expressed fusion protein containing human CTF2 from Dr. N. Tanese (New York University Medical Center) (35Szabo P. Moitra J. Rencendorj A. Rakhely G. Rauch T. Kiss I. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6603-6610Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and a Sepharose G column-purified polyclonal anti-N terminus antibody from Dr. E.-L. Winnacker (Ludwig-Maximilians University). Baculovirus-expressed and purified NF1 was prepared and characterized as described previously (38Rein T. Forster R. Krause A. Winnacker E.-L. Zorbas H. J.

Nuclear extracts from rat liver, rat ventral prostate (normal adult male and 2- and 4-day postcastration) and mouse mammary gland (virgin; 8- and 16-day pregnant, lactating; and 2- and 4-day postweaning) were prepared essentially as described by Andrews et al. (39Andrews N.C. Faller D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (40Robidoux S. Gosselin P. Harvey M. Leclerc S. Guérin S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3796-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cytosol was obtained by saving the supernatant fraction after the tissue homogenate had been centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 10 min (in a Beckman ultracentrifuge rotor, TLA 100.3); the nuclear extract was obtained by salt extraction of the resulting pellet (41Eul J.

The mouse TRPM-2/clusterin gene promoter was 32P-end-labeled on the coding strand using the EcoRI site (at −629) and on the noncoding strand using the internal DraII site (at −276) and was released at the unlabeled end to yield a 353-bp restriction fragment. The oligonucleotides subcloned into pBS KS− (see Fig. 2A) were labeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P] dCTP following restriction with NotI (coding strand) and XhoI (noncoding strand). Nuclear extract (30-200 μg of protein) was preincubated with 300 ng of poly[d(I-C)] in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 60 mM KCl, 0.25 mM Na2EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol on ice for 10 min. Purified labeled fragment (1.5 × 104 cpm) was then added, and the reaction was incubated on ice for 15 min. DNase I digestion was carried out at room temperature for 1 min using a predetermined DNase I dilution of the stock. The stock DNase I (Worthington) was stored at 1 mg/ml and contained approximately 2.6 units/ml. The reactions were terminated by adding twice the reaction volume of 50 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml proteinase K and were then incubated at 44°C for 30 min. The products were precipitated with ethanol and separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea. Maxam and Gilbert G and G + A reactions for the appropriate fragment were run in adjoining lanes. The procedures used were essentially as described in Ref. 43Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

For the EMSA/western analyses a “5 ×” EMSA was run on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The wet gel was autoradiographed for 3 h at room temperature. The bands of interest were then excised and eluted overnight in 100 μl of 2 × loading buffer (20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25 μg/ml bromphenol blue, and 50 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol) at 37°C.

The proteins were transferred to reinforced nitrocellulose (Optitran, Schleicher & Schuell) using a wet transfer system in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mM glycine, 0.01% SDS, and 20% methanol (v/v). The membrane was blocked for 45 min with 1.5% BSA in TBST (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) followed by three 5-min washes in TBST. The primary antibody was incubated with the filter in 1.5% BSA in TBST overnight followed by three 5-min washes in TBST. The secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins/horseradish peroxidase; DAKO) was incubated with the filter at a 1:2,000 dilution in 1.5% BSA in TBST for 2 h. After three 15-min washes in TBST, the bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Total RNA from mouse mammary glands and liver was isolated by a one-step guanidium/phenol method (43Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

For NF1 mRNA analysis, the filter was probed with a random prime-labeled (Prime-a-Gene labeling system, Promega) human CTF/NF1 cDNA (the entire 1.7-kb cDNA fragment was excised from pCTF-1 (23Santoro C.

The filter was washed three times in 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60°C prior to autoradiography. The filter was stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS and was reprobed with a carboxyl terminus NF1-X-specific probe (~600 bp EcoRI/ClaI fragment from the human NF1-X cDNA) (24Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.-U.

Cells were seeded on tissue culture plastic at a density of 2.4 × 106 cells/ml and grown for 48 h in a proliferation medium containing F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Promega), 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 1 mg/ml fetuin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma). The cells were washed and then cultured for a further 24 h in F12 medium (with gentamicin) in the absence of serum but in the presence of 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone. The cultures were subsequently washed extensively, and the medium was changed to differentiation medium (F-12:Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 3 μg/ml prolactin (Sigma)). These cells were then cultured in the absence or presence of an overlaid laminin-rich ECM matrix (Matrigel, 200 μg/ml, Becton Dickinson), which had been diluted in the above medium. After 3.5 days, the cells were harvested. The ECM-overlaid cells were treated with dispase (2.0 mg/ml, Becton Dickinson); the nonoverlaid cells were recovered by scraping and were pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellets were snap frozen and stored at −80°C prior to protein extract preparation or RNA extraction. Cell nuclei were prepared for FACS analysis as described by Gurley et al. (49Gurley L.R.

The DNA was pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Twenty μg of each sample was run on a 1.5% agarose gel at 4 V/cm, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV transillumination and photographed. The sequence of the mouse TRPM-2 promoter (−629/+68) fragment that was cloned by screening a mouse genomic library is shown in Fig. 1A. The promoter sequence is identical to that independently lodged in GenBank (accession number X84792). This region of the 5′-flanking sequence shows a strong homology with the rat promoter sequence (51Wong P. Pineault J. Lakins J. Taillefer D. Leger J. Wang C. Tenniswood M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2041751080,"Two distinct plus strand initiation sites have been identified in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the central polypurine tract (cPPT) and the polypurine tract located just upstream of the U3 region (U3-PPT). When synthesis from the U3-PPT reaches the cPPT, the elongating primer causes limited strand displacement of the product created from the cPPT. We examined whether reverse transcriptase (RT) catalyzed strand transfer recombination is promoted by this process. Using a substrate having the viral sequence of the displaced region, we measured transfer of an elongating DNA primer from a donor DNA to an acceptor DNA. Strand transfer synthesis was only efficient when RT was performing strand displacement synthesis. Transfer efficiency was directly related to acceptor concentration but independent of the reaction time. Transfer could occur to acceptors containing 80, 40, or 20 nucleotides of homology with the template DNA. Using different acceptors, we found that DNA to DNA transfer occurred at positions throughout the donor template, except near the 5′ end. This shows that a number of the sequences downstream of the cPPT region can promote transfer, but once synthesis has progressed to the point where the downstream segment is completely displaced transfer is not allowed. When the DNA to DNA transfer reactions were performed using a template containing nonviral sequences, the transfer efficiency dropped significantly. This indicates that transfer efficiency is determined by the sequences of the templates used. HIV-RT RNase H-dependent strand transfer between RNA templates is well documented. We propose a quite different mechanism for DNA to DNA transfer, consistent with the ability of RNase H minus RT to perform this reaction. If these DNA to DNA transfer events occur in vivo, they will result in plus strand recombination.

Recombination during reverse transcription is possible because each HIV virion contains two genomic RNA molecules that are often different. Two models of retroviral recombination have been proposed, the forced copy choice (1Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and the strand displacement/assimilation model (2Junghans R.P. Boone L.R. Skalka A.M. J.

The forced copy choice model proposes that recombination occurs during synthesis of the first strand of DNA by a process that involves the transfer of the newly synthesized DNA from one viral RNA to the second viral RNA. The strand displacement/assimilation model proposes that recombination occurs during synthesis of the second strand of DNA. According to this latter model, when a piece of downstream DNA is displaced by synthesis from an upstream primer, this unannealed fragment of DNA can bind a second copy of minus strand DNA and there serve as a primer (Fig. 1A). human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase polypurine tract central polypurine tract region unique to the 3′ end of the long terminal repeat ribonuclease H. The strand displacement/assimilation model assumes that each copy of the viral RNA is converted into DNA and that plus strand DNA is initiated at multiple sites.

Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Strand displacement is limited to approximately 100 nucleotides by the presence of very strong pause sites within this region, which are referred to as the central termination sequences (5Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The final plus strand DNA product consists of two segments containing an approximately 100-base pair DNA overlap (5Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Presumably the two DNA segments are repaired by cellular enzymes after the proviral DNA has been transported into the nucleus. This paper deals with the ability of HIV-RT to transfer an elongating DNA primer from its DNA template to a homologous DNA. DNA to DNA transfer has been observed previously by us and others (6Fuentes G.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1966-1971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Luo G. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, DNA to DNA transfer events can lead to the formation of plus strand recombination products by strand displacement and assimilation (2Junghans R.P. Boone L.R. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 544-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Skalka A.M. Boone L. Junghans R. Luk D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 294: 75-86Google Scholar). Our proposed mechanism is different from the strand displacement/assimilation model in that it is the upstream primer rather than the displaced downstream strand that transfers and serves as a primer on the new template (Fig. 1B). The ability of HIV-RT to perform strand transfer reactions between RNA templates is well documented. During reverse transcription an RNA to RNA strand transfer reaction is an obligatory part of each replication cycle (for a review see Ref. 8Whitcomb J.M. Hughes S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 275-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Additionally, RNA to RNA transfer can occur in other areas of the genome, and this process can lead to minus strand recombination products via a mechanism similar to that proposed in the forced copy choice model (9Hu W.-S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1556-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 10Hu W.-S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the conditions that promote DNA to DNA transfer, and the extent of homology necessary for this event to occur. The template used was 101 nucleotides long and contained the viral sequences found downstream of the central polypurine tract. Using this model template, DNA to DNA transfer was only efficient when the enzyme was performing strand displacement synthesis. Transfer efficiency was directly related to acceptor concentration, but it was independent of the reaction time. HIV-RT with native primary structure was provided by the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). The enzyme had a specific activity of 40,000 units/mg. One unit is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into nucleic acid product in 10 min at 37°C using poly(rA)-oligo(dT)16 as template primer. The enzyme was divided into aliquots and stored at −70°C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. An HIV-RT lacking Mg2+-dependent RNase H, (p66E>Q/p51), was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program from Dr. Stuart Le Grice (11Schatz O. Cromme F.V. Gruninger-Leitch F.

Academic Press, New York1995: 130-144Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and Quick Spin columns (G-25 Sephadex) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear. The DNA substrates were obtained from Genosys, Inc. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The DNA oligonucleotides used in the experiments were synthesized by Genosys, Inc. The upstream primer was 5′ end-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified through G-25 Sephadex Quick Spin columns. The hybrids were prepared by mixing the primers and the template at a 5 to 1 molar ratio in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA and 80 mM KCl. The mixture was heated at 90°C for 10 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature. In most of the experiments the upstream and downstream primers were mixed together with the template; however, in some experiments the downstream primer was omitted. The sequences of substrates used in this study are as follows.

The underlined sequences represent the region of homology shared between the acceptor template and the corresponding donor templates. Approximately 1.5 nM of substrate was pre-incubated with the enzyme for 3 min in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 32 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA. The reactions were started by the addition of 6 mM MgCl2, 50 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and, in the experiments indicated, the acceptor template. The reactions were performed in a final volume of 12.5 μl at 37°C for 30 min unless otherwise specified. The amount of enzyme and the concentration of acceptor used in each experiment is specified in each figure legend. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of a 2 × loading buffer (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mM EDTA (pH 8), 0.1% xylene cyanole, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Unless otherwise specified, samples were separated using 8% denaturing sequencing gels containing 7 M urea (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.21-11.28Google Scholar). The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. All quantitations were performed in the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The substrates used in this study are shown in Fig. 2. The substrate sequences are found in the middle of the HIV genome, downstream of the central polypurine tract, in the integrase coding region. The nucleotide sequence of donor template 1 is complementary to the plus strand sequence from nucleotides 4387 to 4487 of the HIV-1 provirus (14Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K. Ivanoff L. Pettewary Jr., S.R. Pearson M.L. Lautenberger J.A. Papas T.S. Ghrayeb H. Chang N.T. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1985; 313: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). This region was chosen because it experiences strand displacement synthesis in vivo and because it contains sites that cause prominent pausing of the RT, which are designated the central termination sequences (5Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 15Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The donor template and downstream primer are 101 and 80 nucleotides long, respectively. The reaction is initiated from a 16-nucleotide primer that binds two nucleotides in from the 3′ end of the template. The strand transfer acceptor templates are of various lengths, and their regions of homology with the template DNA are shown in Fig. 2. Full-length synthesis over the donor template produces a 99-nucleotide-long product, whereas strand transfer synthesis produces a 119-139-nucleotide-long product, depending on the acceptor template used. Fig. 3A shows a reaction in which the primer-donor template, having or lacking a downstream primer, was subjected to HIV-RT-directed DNA synthesis in the presence of increasing concentrations of acceptor A. The first 80 bases of the acceptor A are homologous to the last 80 bases of the donor template. The strong pause sites that the elongating primer encounters at the end of the donor template correspond to the positions of the central termination sequences (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 3A). Significant amounts of transfer products were detected only in the presence of a downstream primer annealed to the donor template (Fig. 3A, lanes 9-13). A faint transfer product was occasionally observed in the absence of a downstream primer after long exposure times (data not shown). We calculated transfer efficiency using a PhosphorImager. Transfer efficiency is defined as the amount of full-length transfer product divided by the sum of the amounts of full-length donor template-directed synthesis and the amount of full-length transfer product (16DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the DNA to DNA transfer efficiency increased with increasing concentrations of acceptor template. This phenomenon has been previously observed for RNA to RNA transfer (7Luo G. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of a downstream primer, the highest DNA to DNA strand transfer efficiency observed was 2.1%. In the presence of a downstream primer, this value increased to 18.6% (Fig. 3B). At the highest acceptor concentration used, DNA synthesis and strand transfer were inhibited. This could result from trapping of the enzyme by the large excess of DNA in the reaction. The DNA to DNA transfer reactions shown in Fig. 3A were also measured over a time course (Fig. 3C). Again, significant transfer was only detected in the presence of a downstream primer. Transfer products were observed after 10 min. From this point on, the total amount of transfer product increased with time, but the transfer efficiency remained constant at approximately 18%. The homologous sequences between donor and acceptor extend to the very 5′ end of the donor template, so that homologous strand transfer could have occurred after complete synthesis on the donor. The constant efficiency suggests that DNA to DNA strand transfer is an event that takes place actively during strand displacement synthesis, rather than after full-length donor template-directed synthesis has been achieved. On the other hand, RNA to RNA transfer efficiency, with substrates allowing homologous transfer from the end of the donor template, increases with the reaction time (7Luo G. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation indicates that the rate-limiting factor for the RNA transfer reaction is the formation of a full-length donor template-directed product (7Luo G. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from which transfer product then derives. The DNA to DNA transfer product was undetectable in the absence of a downstream primer (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the rest of the experiments presented in this paper will use the substrate containing a downstream primer. RNA to RNA transfer is dependent on the ability of the RNase H activity of HIV-RT to cleave the template RNA (7Luo G. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although RNA to RNA transfer is relatively efficient, DNA to DNA transfer is inefficient unless the enzyme is performing strand displacement synthesis (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). These observations indicate that DNA to DNA transfer must be occurring by a completely different mechanism. This conclusion is verified by the ability of an RNase H minus HIV-RT to perform DNA to DNA transfer (Fig. 4). We hypothesize that strand displacement synthesis is the mechanistic key to DNA to DNA transfer. When the elongating primer is performing strand displacement synthesis, the displaced primer will compete with the elongating upstream primer for binding to the template. During this process, the downstream primer can transiently bind the template beneath the upstream primer and dislodge the 3′ end of the elongating primer. The 3′ end of the upstream primer is then available to bind to the acceptor template.Fig. 4DNA to DNA strand transfer to acceptor 1A by RNase H minus HIV-RT. Primer-donor template 1, containing a downstream primer, was incubated with decreasing concentrations of enzyme and a 10:1 molar ratio of acceptor to donor template.

In all cases the donor substrate contained a downstream primer, and the acceptor was present at a 10:1 molar ratio over the donor template. Full-length donor-directed products and transfer products are indicated by the letters F and T, respectively. For purposes of comparison, transfer efficiencies in lane 1 with acceptors A-E are 18, 31, 20, <2, and 36%, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6DNA to DNA transfer from primer-donor template 1 to acceptors 1A and 1F. The donor substrate contained a downstream primer. The reactions were carried out using 4 units of HIV-RT and a 10:1 molar ratio of acceptor to donor template. Sequencing reactions with single stranded M13mp18 were carried out using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's directions. The products were separated using a 5% denaturing sequencing gel containing 7 M urea. The sizes of the full-length donor-directed and transfer products are indicated in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the degree of homology necessary for transfer to occur, we measured transfer to acceptors containing 80, 40, or 20 nucleotides of homology with the donor template DNA (acceptors shown in Fig. 2). Transfer occurred to both acceptors B and C, each containing 40 nucleotides of homology with the donor template DNA (Fig. 5, B and C). Transfer occurred to acceptor E but not to acceptor D, both containing 20 nucleotides of homology with the donor template DNA (Fig. 5, D and E). Because transfer to acceptor E was efficient, transfer can occur to acceptor templates containing a homologous region of 20 or even possibly fewer nucleotides. The fact that transfer to acceptor D was not observed indicates that most transfers occur during strand displacement synthesis, rather than near the 5′ end of the donor template after the displaced strand is completely dissociated. These results suggest that DNA transfer can occur anywhere throughout the donor template, as long as the downstream strand is only partially displaced. We cannot interpret moderate differences in transfer efficiency measured with different acceptor templates, because this process involves synthesis through different sequences. For example, primer elongation after transfer to acceptors A and C involves synthesis through the same strong pause sites encountered at the end of the donor template DNA (indicated by an arrow on Fig. 3A). However, elongation on acceptors B and E may not involve synthesis through any strong pause sites, because these templates have large 5′ regions that are not homologous to the donor template. This situation would cause an increase in transfer efficiency in experiments with acceptor B and E (Fig. 5, B and E). Interestingly, transfer efficiency did not drop when the homology in the acceptor template was reduced from 80 to 40 nucleotides. In order to determine the positions of transfer, we created an acceptor having a 2-nucleotide deletion every 18 nucleotides (acceptor F, Fig. 2). Using acceptor F, the length of the transfer product could be 113, 115, 117, or 119 nucleotides depending on the point of primer transfer. Transfer experiments were performed using acceptors A and F. The reaction products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 6). To determine the precise size of the products, sequencing reactions were run in the same gel. Full-length donor-directed products were 99 and 100 nucleotides long. The 99-nucleotide-long product corresponds to the full-length product, and the 100-nucleotide-long product is generated by the addition of a nontemplate-directed nucleotide by HIV-RT (17Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the presence of acceptor A, we observed the expected 119 and 120 nucleotide long products. The 120-nucleotide-long product corresponds to the nontemplate-directed addition of a nucleotide by HIV-RT before or after transfer. In the presence of acceptor F, we observed products 113-118 nucleotides long. These products correspond to the expected 113-, 115-, and 117-nucleotide-long transfer products, plus the corresponding set of products one nucleotide longer caused by nontemplate-directed nucleotide addition. Using acceptor F, none of the transfer products were 119 nucleotides long. The strongest transfer bands using acceptor F were at positions 115 and 117 rather than at position 113. This indicates that transfer is not uniquely enhanced at the position where the upstream primer initiates strand displacement synthesis. Furthermore, these results confirm that DNA to DNA transfer can occur anywhere throughout the template, except near the end. To determine the effect of the overall template sequence in the DNA to DNA transfer event, we tested whether DNA transfer could take place using substrate 2. The donor template was 104 nucleotides long, and the downstream primer was 79 nucleotides long (see Fig. 2). Thus, the strand displacement region in substrate 2 was approximately the same length as the one in substrate 1. The acceptor was 99 nucleotides long, and the first 79 bases of the acceptor were homologous to the last 79 bases of the donor template. Although the sequences of substrate 2 are not encountered in the virus, they also contain strong pause sites. Fig. 7 shows a reaction in which the primer-donor template 2, having or lacking a downstream primer, was incubated with increasing concentrations of HIV-RT in the presence of acceptor 2. Transfer products were detected only in the presence of a downstream primer, and the transfer efficiency ranged from 6-7.8%. This result indicates that the efficiency of DNA to DNA transfer is influenced by the overall sequences of the templates used in the reaction. Two distinct plus strand initiation sites have been identified in HIV, the cPPT and the U3-PPT (4Charneau P. Clavel F. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When synthesis from the U3-PPT reaches the cPPT, the elongating primer causes limited strand displacement of the product created from the cPPT (5Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Because this region is involved in strand displacement in vivo, we considered that it could be a site for efficient recombination via the strand displacement/assimilation model or a similar mechanism. HIV-RT catalyzed DNA strand transfer was found to occur efficiently in vitro, when measured on substrates having the viral sequences involved in displacement synthesis in vivo. HIV-RT can catalyze the transfer of a DNA primer from a donor template DNA to an acceptor DNA. We show that this reaction requires strand displacement synthesis and is influenced by the acceptor concentration. The length, position, and sequence of the homology between the acceptor DNA and the template DNA are also important influences. Likewise, the overall sequences of the templates used to measure DNA to DNA transfer have a major impact on the efficiency of the process. The experiments shown here were carried out with a 101-nucleotide-long template containing viral sequences downstream of the central polypurine tract. Using these sequences and other sequences of similar length, efficient DNA to DNA transfer was only observed when the enzyme was performing strand displacement synthesis. We have shown previously, using a 667-nucleotide-long DNA template containing the sequences of the HIV long terminal repeats, that HIV-RT can catalyze strand transfer synthesis independent of the downstream primer (6Fuentes G.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1966-1971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We proposed that with the long terminal repeat substrate, DNA to DNA transfer could be independent of the downstream primer because the template can form hairpin structures that resemble the strand displacement substrate. Displacement would then have to occur periodically as the primer was elongated. This interpretation was supported by results showing that the reaction was further stimulated when the presence of a downstream primer necessitated continuous strand displacement synthesis. Strand transfer from an RNA template requires the action of the RNase H of the RT (7Luo G. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It is thought to occur because RNase H-directed degradation of the RNA template frees the primer to bind to a new template. In this case, sequences and structures of the donor template that cause pausing of synthesis promote transfer. They do so by allowing the RNase H a longer opportunity to degrade the RNA template while the RT is paused. We hypothesize that strand displacement synthesis promotes primer transfer from a DNA template by an entirely different mechanism. The displaced downstream primer can compete with the extending upstream primer for binding to the template. The downstream primer could transiently bind the template beneath the upstream primer, dislodging a region of the upstream primer near its 3′ end. This region would then be available to bind to the acceptor template. The ability of the displaced downstream primer to compete with the upstream primer may be similar at all points throughout the reaction, because both primers are always equivalently complementary to the template at any position. This should tend to make the probability of transfer similar throughout the template. However, other factors, discussed below, could alter transfer efficiency at each position. The DNA to DNA transfer mechanism is not unique to HIV-RT, because Sequenase, which is capable of strand displacement synthesis, can also perform this reaction (data not shown). The probability of transfer is not likely to be absolutely uniform along the donor template. Some sequences may allow either more rapid equilibration between the two competing primers or a longer region of displacement. Also it is possible that sequences that promote dissociation of the RT allow more primer equilibration. In this way, pause site sequences may still influence transfer but for a completely different reason than for transfer from RNA templates. In support of a lack of uniformity, we have shown that transfer from DNA templates is influenced by the overall sequence of the templates used in the reaction. The long terminal repeat and the sequences downstream of the central polypurine tract are the two areas of the viral genome known to be involved in strand displacement in vivo. Higher transfer efficiencies were observed using both of these viral sequences (Ref. 6Fuentes G.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1966-1971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar; Fig. 3) than with the nonviral substrate 2 sequence (Fig. 7). This observation suggests that particular areas of the viral genome involved in strand displacement synthesis could form structures that promote DNA to DNA transfer. In our experiments, transfer efficiency was directly related to acceptor concentration, but independent of the reaction time. As explained above, this observation suggests that transfer takes place actively during strand displacement synthesis and not after a full-length product has been synthesized. Furthermore, our results using acceptor templates with homologies to different regions of the donor template indicate that transfer can occur at more than one position in the homologous region. In particular, use of an acceptor template with periodic two nucleotide deletions allowed determination of the positions of transfer based on the final length distribution of transfer products. This experiment further showed that transfer occurred throughout the homologous region, except near the 5′ end of the donor template. Overall, these results show that once strand displacement is initiated, strand transfer can occur with high efficiency. The point at which the upstream primer on the donor template encounters the displaceable downstream primer is not a particularly hot spot for transfer. Similarly, it is not clear whether prominent pause sites for synthesis over the donor template are exceptionally effective at promoting transfer. Transfer does not occur near the 5′ end of the donor template, presumably because once synthesis has progressed to the point where the downstream primer is completely displaced transfer is not allowed. All of these observations support the hypothesis that competition for binding the template between the extending upstream primer and the partly displaced downstream primer forces transient dissociation of the 3′ end of the upstream primer, driving the transfer reaction. In vivo, DNA to DNA transfer events could lead to the formation of plus strand recombination products via a mechanism similar to the strand displacement/assimilation model (Fig. 1B). The only direct evidence supporting the displacement/assimilation model of plus strand recombination is the observation of branched structures during replication using electron microscopy (2Junghans R.P. Boone L.R. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 544-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions discussed in this paper can give rise to the same phenotype.

INTRODUCTIONTwo distinct classes of calcium channel are known to be involved in the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). One class is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated calcium channel (IP3 1The abbreviations used are: IP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateRyRryanodine receptorbpkilobase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)5′-RACErapid amplification of 5′ cDNA endsPCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. receptor), which releases Ca2+ from stores upon binding to the second messenger, IP3 (2Majerus P.W.

IP3 receptors are widely distributed and expressed in both excitable and non-excitable tissues, reflecting the ubiquitous nature of the IP3 signal transduction pathway (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). The second class of intracellular calcium channel is sensitive to ryanodine, a neutral plant alkaloid, and is known to be expressed at moderate to high levels in electrically excitable tissues (5Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). There are currently three known ryanodine receptor isoforms (RyR-1, −2, and −3), each of which comprise subunits of Mr∼560,000 (5Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol.

All three isoforms are present in the brain, whereas skeletal and cardiac muscle express RyR-1 and −3 and RyR-2 and −3, respectively (7Lai F.A. Dent M. Wickenden C. Xu L. Kumari G. Misra M. Lee H.B.

The possible role of RyRs in intracellular Ca2+ signaling in non-excitable cells, as well as its precise functional relationship with the ubiquitous IP3 receptors, remains undefined. Physiological and pharmacological observations of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores have also been made in numerous other cell types, based on the actions of agents that affect muscle RyRs, such as caffeine and ryanodine (14Wakui M. Osipchuk Y.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1990; 63: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15Malgaroli A. Fesce R. Meldolesi J. J. Biol.

This evidence in disparate, non-excitable cells suggests the possibility of a more widespread involvement of RyRs in fundamental intracellular Ca2+ signaling processes than in only excitable tissues. However, the presence of ryanodine receptor proteins in non-excitable cells has thus far not been demonstrated. In this study, we have used molecular, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches to provide evidence for the specific expression of the RyR-2 isoform in kidney tissue and in the non-excitable kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-RK1. These studies indicate that regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis via release from internal stores in non-excitable cells may involve complex interactions between specific isoforms of RyR and IP3 receptors.DISCUSSIONMany electrophysiological and pharmacological studies in disparate cell types have provided consistent evidence for ryanodine- and caffeine-sensitive intracellular calcium stores, suggesting the existence of a functional RyR protein in electrically non-excitable as well as excitable cells (14Wakui M.

The level of RyR isoform transcripts has been observed to be most abundant in excitable tissues such as skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, heart, and brain, with much lower levels detected in other tissues (9Hakamata Y.

Res. 1993; 72: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hence, there have been no reports describing the presence of a RyR protein in a non-excitable tissue, which would account for the ryanodine- and caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ pools observed. There may be a novel RyR homologue present in these tissues, or there may be a low level expression of an existing RyR isoform. We have addressed this question in the current study by using a consensus oligonucleotide probe to screen for RyR-related cDNAs in a library derived from rabbit kidney cortical tissue. Our finding, that a single clone corresponding to the RyR-2 isoform was detected (Fig. 1), suggests that this is the sole RyR isoform present in this tissue. Further analysis by RT-PCR with kidney mRNA using isoform-specific primers confirmed this observation of specific expression of RyR-2, and not of the RyR-1 and −3 isoforms (Fig. 2). It may be possible that the RyR-2 detected in the kidney library had originated from some contaminating smooth muscle present in blood vessel walls (32Lesh R.E. Marks A.R. Somlyo A.V. Fleischer S. Somlyo A.P. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We therefore employed an established rabbit kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-RK1, to determine for the presence of an RyR isoform in this non-excitable cell. The specific identification of an RyR-2-related transcript encoding a protein sequence with 99.7% identity to that of the RyR-2 indicates that expression of the RyR-2 protein is conserved in this non-excitable kidney cell line. Furthermore, these results suggest that the RyR-2 may therefore play a fundamental role in intracellular calcium homeostasis in this cell type. The observation of a short, ∼2.5-kb transcript of RyR-1 in brain (28Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Nishi M. Ikeda M. Sugimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) led us to speculate on the possible existence of a comparable short RyR-2 transcript. However, we were unable to detect a short transcript in Northern blots of brain and kidney (data not shown). In addition, the 5′-RACE experiments performed using brain and kidney mRNA suggest that the RyR-2 transcript in these tissues extends >7 kb from the carboxyl-terminal stop codon (Fig. 3) and are therefore not consistent with the existence of a short RyR-2 transcript in these tissues. Finally, the presence of a native, full-length, and pharmacologically active RyR was demonstrated in our observation of specific binding to a high Mr protein by the RyR-2 antibody (Fig. 4) and also by the specific binding of kidney microsomes to [3H]ryanodine (Table I). Overall, our results provide clear evidence for the expression of RyR-2 in kidney and a kidney epithelial cell and suggest this isoform may mediate the ryanodine- and caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store that has been shown to be regulated by vitamin D metabolites in cultured kidney proximal tubules (33Suzuki M. Kurihara S. Kawaguchi Y. Sakai O. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F757-F763PubMed Google Scholar).

Finally, the presence of a native, full-length, and pharmacologically active RyR was demonstrated in our observation of specific binding to a high Mr protein by the RyR-2 antibody (Fig. 4) and also by the specific binding of kidney microsomes to [3H]ryanodine (Table I). Overall, our results provide clear evidence for the expression of RyR-2 in kidney and a kidney epithelial cell and suggest this isoform may mediate the ryanodine- and caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store that has been shown to be regulated by vitamin D metabolites in cultured kidney proximal tubules (33Suzuki M. Kurihara S. Kawaguchi Y. Sakai O. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F757-F763PubMed Google Scholar). Many electrophysiological and pharmacological studies in disparate cell types have provided consistent evidence for ryanodine- and caffeine-sensitive intracellular calcium stores, suggesting the existence of a functional RyR protein in electrically non-excitable as well as excitable cells (14Wakui M.

The level of RyR isoform transcripts has been observed to be most abundant in excitable tissues such as skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, heart, and brain, with much lower levels detected in other tissues (9Hakamata Y.

Hence, there have been no reports describing the presence of a RyR protein in a non-excitable tissue, which would account for the ryanodine- and caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ pools observed. There may be a novel RyR homologue present in these tissues, or there may be a low level expression of an existing RyR isoform. We have addressed this question in the current study by using a consensus oligonucleotide probe to screen for RyR-related cDNAs in a library derived from rabbit kidney cortical tissue. Our finding, that a single clone corresponding to the RyR-2 isoform was detected (Fig. 1), suggests that this is the sole RyR isoform present in this tissue. Further analysis by RT-PCR with kidney mRNA using isoform-specific primers confirmed this observation of specific expression of RyR-2, and not of the RyR-1 and −3 isoforms (Fig. 2). It may be possible that the RyR-2 detected in the kidney library had originated from some contaminating smooth muscle present in blood vessel walls (32Lesh R.E. Marks A.R. Somlyo A.V. Fleischer S. Somlyo A.P. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We therefore employed an established rabbit kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-RK1, to determine for the presence of an RyR isoform in this non-excitable cell. The specific identification of an RyR-2-related transcript encoding a protein sequence with 99.7% identity to that of the RyR-2 indicates that expression of the RyR-2 protein is conserved in this non-excitable kidney cell line. Furthermore, these results suggest that the RyR-2 may therefore play a fundamental role in intracellular calcium homeostasis in this cell type. The observation of a short, ∼2.5-kb transcript of RyR-1 in brain (28Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Nishi M. Ikeda M. Sugimoto T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) led us to speculate on the possible existence of a comparable short RyR-2 transcript. However, we were unable to detect a short transcript in Northern blots of brain and kidney (data not shown). In addition, the 5′-RACE experiments performed using brain and kidney mRNA suggest that the RyR-2 transcript in these tissues extends >7 kb from the carboxyl-terminal stop codon (Fig. 3) and are therefore not consistent with the existence of a short RyR-2 transcript in these tissues. Finally, the presence of a native, full-length, and pharmacologically active RyR was demonstrated in our observation of specific binding to a high Mr protein by the RyR-2 antibody (Fig. 4) and also by the specific binding of kidney microsomes to [3H]ryanodine (Table I).

Mackrill for the preparation of the RyR-1 antibody and to Dr. David Ogden for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1981191002,"Chemical cross-linking combined with site-directed mutagenesis was used to evaluate the role of extracellular cysteines and their positions relative to the binding site for the agonist bradykinin (BK) in the human BK B2 receptor. All extracellular cysteines, Cys20, Cys103, Cys184, and Cys277, in the receptor were mutated to serines, and single and double mutants were transfected into COS-7 cells. The Ser20 and Ser277 single mutants and the Ser20/Ser277 double mutant bound [3H]BK and the antagonist [3H]NPC17731 with pharmacological profiles identical to the wild-type B2 receptor. In contrast, the Ser103 and Ser184 single mutants were unable to bind either of the two radioligands. However, these mutants were still expressed as determined by immunoblotting with anti-B2 receptor antibodies. Previous studies on the bovine B2 receptor showed that bifunctional reagents, which are reactive to amines at one end and to free sulfhydryls in the opposite end, cross-link the N terminus of receptor-bound BK to a sulfhydryl in the receptor (Herzig, M. C. S., and Leeb-Lundberg, L. M. F. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 20591-20598). Here, we show that m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene cross-linked BK to the wild-type human B2 receptor and the Ser20 and Ser277 single mutant receptors, whereas these reagents were unable to cross-link BK to the Ser20/Ser277 double mutant. These results show that Cys103 and Cys184 are both required for expression of high affinity agonist and antagonist binding sites in the human B2 receptor, while Cys20 and Cys277 are not required. Furthermore, the results provide direct biochemical evidence that the N terminus of BK, when bound to the B2 receptor, is adjacent to Cys277 in extracellular domain 4 and Cys20 in extracellular domain 1 of the receptor.

Ther. 1995; 275: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar) has revealed that this receptor belongs to the seven transmembrane-domain GPCR superfamily. These receptors have an extracellular N terminus named extracellular domain 1 (EC-I), an intracellular C terminus named intracellular domain 4 (IC-IV), and seven highly conserved transmembrane domains (TM-I-VII) interrupted by three intracellular loops (IC-I-III) and three extracellular loops (EC-II-IV) which alternate. The delineation of the domains in GPCR that are involved in the binding of ligands is a central question in the understanding of these receptors and crucial in the development of specific receptor antagonists. GPCRs for cationic amines bind agonists using residues located exclusively within transmembrane domains (8Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), while those for glycoproteins bind agonists using residues located primarily in the extracellular domains (9Coughlin S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the binding of peptide agonists to GPCRs appears to involve residues located in both extracellular and transmembrane domains (8Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 10Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R. Stormann T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Only limited progress has been made in delineating the binding site(s) for BK in the B2 receptor. Using site-directed mutagenesis, residues located near the extracellular surface in TM-VI were shown to be important for high affinity agonist binding (12Nardone J. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Freedman R. Jarnagin K. Fritz H. Muller-Esterl W. Jochum M. Roscher A. Luppertz K. Recent Progress on Kinins. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1992: 487-496Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, agonist binding was shown also to be critically dependent on specific charged residues in EC-IV (10Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R. Stormann T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The involvement of extracellular residues in the binding of BK to the B2 receptor is not surprising considering the hydrophilic nature of this peptide. Interestingly, most mutations in the B2 receptor that affect agonist affinity only minimally affect antagonist affinity. Thus, the agonist and antagonist binding sites in the B2 receptor do not appear to be identical and may overlap only partially if at all.Recently, we found that the N terminus of BK when bound to the B2 receptor in bovine myometrial membranes can be cross-linked by heterobifunctional cross-linkers to a sulfhydryl residue(s) in the receptor (14Herzig M.C.S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20591-20598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The sequence of the bovine B2 receptor is unknown. However, the sequences of the human (3Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.S. Ransom R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ther. 1995; 275: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar) B2 receptors contain a conserved cysteine in each extracellular domain, as well as several cysteines in the transmembrane and intracellular domains. Considering that a sulfhydryl is located within the radii of the linker arms of the cross-linkers attached to the N terminus of the receptor-bound BK (14Herzig M.C.S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20591-20598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we concluded that cross-linking studies on B2 receptors in which cysteines have been mutated to serines should enable us to identify directly the positioning of the N terminus of BK relative to specific cysteine residues in the receptor. In this report, we show the results of radioligand binding and cross-linking studies on WT human B2 receptors and receptors in which individual extracellular cysteines were replaced with serines.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed the role of the four cysteines located on the extracellular surface of the BK B2 receptor and their positioning relative to the N terminus of BK when bound to the receptor. Our results show that Cys103 in EC-II and Cys184 in EC-III are essential for formation of high affinity agonist and antagonist binding sites in the receptor, while Cys20 in the EC-I and Cys277 in EC-IV are not essential. We further demonstrate that either Cys20 or Cys277 in the B2 receptor provides the sulfhydryl necessary for the bifunctional reagents MBS and DFDNB to cross-link receptor-bound BK to the receptor. Consequently, these residues must be located within the radius of the linker arms of MBS (9.9 Å) and DFDNB (3 Å) when attached to the N terminus of the receptor-bound BK.Two of the four extracellular cysteines in the B2 receptor, Cys103 in EC-II and Cys184 in EC-III (Fig. 5), are conserved in most members of the GPCR superfamily of which the sequence is known (8Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 18Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Studies with two members, rhodopsin and the β-adrenergic receptor, have revealed that these two cysteines are required for proper expression of the receptor (19Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Register R.B. Scattergood W. Rands E. Strader C.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 20Fraser C.M. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 8459-8493Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Most likely, these residues are linked in a disulfide bond that stabilizes the correctly folded conformation of the receptors. The Ser103 and Ser184 mutants of the B2 receptor were expressed in the membrane of COS-7 cells. However, these mutants did not express any high affinity binding sites for either the agonist BK or the antagonist NPC17731. Thus, in consensus with other members of the GPCR family, the B2 receptor appears to be absolutely dependent on these cysteines for expression of high affinity ligand binding sites. Conversely, Cys20 in EC-I and Cys277 in EC-IV are semi-conserved in the GPCR family and are found in the BK B2 receptor (3Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S. Strader C.S. Ransom R.W. Biochem.

Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In the current secondary structure model of GPCR based originally on the crystal structure of bacteriorhodopsin (30Engelman D.M. Henderson R. McLachlan A.D. Wallace B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2023-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7439-7442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and since modified by the recent crystal structure of rhodopsin (32Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 7700-7772Crossref Scopus (707) Google Scholar) and hydropathicity analysis of over 200 members of the receptor superfamily (33Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), the seven transmembrane helices are believed not to be in a linear array but rather to be folded back upon themselves juxtapositioning TM-I and TM-VII and bringing the EC-I in relatively close proximity to EC-IV (Fig. 5). Thus, it is reasonable to suspect that a disulfide bond may exist between the cysteines in EC-I and in EC-IV and may be required to stabilize the folding of these GPCRs. The Ser20 and Ser277 mutants of the B2 receptor were expressed and displayed pharmacological profiles identical to that of the WT receptor. Thus, a disulfide bond between Cys20 and Cys277 in the B2 receptor, if present, is not critical for expression of high affinity agonist and antagonist binding sites. Furthermore, these residues do not appear to be involved directly as determinants in either agonist or antagonist binding to this receptor. Dithiothreitol had little effect on the binding of BK to the B2 receptor in both bovine myometrial membranes (14Herzig M.C.S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20591-20598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and intact rat myometrial cells. 2L. M. F. Leeb-Lundberg, unpublished observations. Thus, even though disulfide bonds between some extracellular cysteines in the B2 receptor may be crucial during insertion of the receptor into the membrane for formation of proper binding sites, reducing such bonds in receptors already expressed in the membrane does not denature the agonist binding site. In contrast, expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptors in which the cysteines in EC-I and EC-IV are replaced with glycines resulted in a 10-fold decrease in angiotensin II affinity (34Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Chaki S. Guo D.-E. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of angiotensin II to the WT receptor is sensitive to dithiothreitol. Thus, high affinity agonist binding to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor may be dependent on a disulfide between the cysteines in EC-I and EC-IV. The binding of losartan, a high affinity non-peptide angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, was not sensitive to mutation of the above cysteines (34Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Chaki S. Guo D.-E. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the affinity of agonist binding decreased and the affinity of antagonist binding increased upon mutation of Cys20 and Cys277 to serines either singly or in combination. According to a three-state model of agonist and antagonist binding to the B2 receptor that we proposed (35Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. Herzig M.C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25970-25973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that these mutations favor the antagonist-stabilized inactive state of the receptor. This conclusion was supported by the increased Gpp(NH)p sensitivity of BK binding to at least one of the mutants, Ser20/Ser277. As the shift in agonist and antagonist affinity was observed with both the single and double mutants, it is possible that the normal equilibrium between conformational states of the receptor requires a disulfide bond between Cys20 and Cys277.The cross-linking studies presented here using the human B2 receptor are a direct extension of our previous studies using the B2 receptor in bovine myometrial membranes (14Herzig M.C.S.

In the previous studies, we showed that heterobifunctional reagents such as MBS, which are reactive to amines at one end and to free sulfhydryls in the opposite end, and DFDNB, which is usually considered to be homobifunctional in activity and structure, cross-link the N terminus of receptor-bound BK to a sulfhydryl in the receptor. Consequently, we concluded that the N terminus of BK when bound to the receptor is adjacent to a cysteine in the receptor. The agonist binding site on the B2 receptor was distinguished from the antagonist binding site by the fact that these cross-linking reagents were completely unable to cross-link either NPC17731 or HOE140, two high affinity receptor antagonists, to the receptor. Molecular modeling studies (37Kyle D.J. Curr. Pharmaceut. Des. 1995; 1: 233-254Google Scholar), which are supported by experimental site-directed mutagenesis studies (10Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R. Stormann T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggest that the N terminus of BK when bound to the receptor is extracellular. Consequently, four cysteine residues, Cys20, Cys103, Cys184, and Cys277, in the receptor are candidates for providing the sulfhydryls necessary for MBS and DFDNB to cross-link BK to the receptor. As described above, two of these cysteines, Cys103 and Cys184, are presumed to be involved in a disulfide bond and, consequently, are not believed to be accessible for reaction with the cross-linkers. By identifying which, if any, of the above cysteines are critical for cross-linking, we would be able to identify which extracellular domains are adjacent to the BK N terminus. In this study, we show that the BK N terminus can be cross-linked by MBS and DFDNB to the receptor through both Cys20 in the EC-I and Cys277 in EC-IV. Indeed, only with the substitution of serine residues for both of these cysteine residues could the cross-linking of BK to the B2 receptor by MBS and DFDNB be prevented. These results exclude all other cysteines present in the receptor or any non-receptor cysteines in the membrane as anchors for the cross-linking. Therefore, we conclude that both EC-I and EC-IV of the receptor are positioned near the N terminus of BK when located in the agonist binding site. These biochemical results directly support the most recent structural model of GPCR described above in which the seven transmembrane helices are folded back upon themselves so that TM-I is adjacent to TM-VII. Indeed, without such an oval array of the seven transmembrane helices, it is difficult to envision how both EC-I and EC-IV could be within reach of the linker arm of the cross-linkers.There is no immediate consensus for the exact location of the agonist and antagonist binding sites in the B2 receptor. However, several studies using different techniques including chemical cross-linking (14Herzig M.C.S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20591-20598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (10Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R. Stormann T.M.

Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1992: 487-496Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) show that these two sites are not identical and may be only partially overlapping. Mutagenesis studies using the rat B2 receptor have revealed some information regarding the possible location of the agonist binding site. Individual mutations of two conserved aspartate residues, Asp268 and Asp286 in EC-IV, which correspond to Asp266 and Asp284 in the human receptor (Fig. 5), to alanines resulted in a 17- and 25-fold decrease in BK affinity, respectively, and the double mutation resulted in a 500-fold decrease (10Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R. Stormann T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with a model of BK bound to the B2 receptor proposed by Kyle based on structural homology modeling, molecular modeling, and systematic conformational searching methods of BK and the receptor (37Kyle D.J. Curr. Pharmaceut. Des. 1995; 1: 233-254Google Scholar). In this model, Asp268 and Asp286 in the receptor interact electrostatically with the N-terminal amino group, the guanidinyl side chain, or both of Arg1 in BK, a residue absolutely crucial for receptor binding. Immediately below EC-IV in TM-VI of the rat receptor residues crucial for high affinity agonist binding have also been identified. Replacement of Phe261 with alanine decreased agonist affinity by 1,600-fold (12Nardone J. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Freedman R. Jarnagin K. Fritz H. Muller-Esterl W. Jochum M. Roscher A. Luppertz K. Recent Progress on Kinins. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1992: 487-496Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), while replacement of Thr265 with either alanine or valine decreased agonist affinity by 700-fold (12Nardone J. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A more modest decrease of 10-fold in the agonist affinity was observed when Gln262 and Thr267 were replaced with alanines (12Nardone J. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that residues located near the extracellular side in TM-VI and in EC-IV are parts of an agonist binding site in the B2 receptor. Anti-peptide antibodies developed against the C-terminal half of EC-IV of the human B2 receptor inhibited agonist binding providing further support for the involvement of this domain in this interaction. Interestingly, antibodies against the N-terminal half of EC-III inhibited both agonist and antagonist binding. Thus, determinants in EC-III and possibly in TM-IV and TM-V may be involved in binding both classes of ligands (16Abd Alla S. Quitterer U. Gregoriev S. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Jarnagin K. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).In conclusion, based on molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, the consensus is evolving that regions in EC-IV and TM-VI are critical in the binding of agonists to the B2 receptor. However, these approaches clearly have limitation. The former approach is purely theoretical, while the latter approach may be either an effect of altering directly a ligand binding determinant in the receptor or an effect of a conformational change in the receptor, which is induced at a site distant to the binding site. Our approach using chemical cross-linking combined with site-directed mutagenesis probes residues that are located at a distance no greater than the linker arm of the cross-linking reagent from the bound ligand. The results that we have obtained indicate that the cysteines in EC-IV and EC-I of the B2 receptor can exist at a distance as short as 3 Å from the N terminus of the bound BK. Considering the current secondary structure model of GPCR, our results directly support the positioning of the N terminus of BK bound to the B2 receptor at the extracellular surface below EC-IV. Cys277 is positioned 11 residues beyond Asp266 and 7 residues before Asp284, residues believed to be located at the interface between TM-VI and TM-VII, respectively. This pair of acidic residues is also thought to participate in an electrostatic interaction(s) with the N-terminal Arg1 in BK. The straight chain distance between Asp266 and Cys277, which is about 40 Å, and between Asp284 and Cys277, which is about 30 Å, indicate that EC-IV must be folded to align this cysteine and these aspartates with the BK N terminus. However, given the fact that both MBS and DFDNB can cross-link BK to these cysteines, there must be some flexibility either in the MBS linker arm or in EC-IV and EC-I. Interestingly, DFDNB cross-linking of BK to the Ser277 mutant was consistently less than that to the Ser20 mutant. Indeed, this result is not unexpected with this short cross-linker, since according to our model Cys20 may be located slightly further away than Cys277 from the BK N terminus. Finally, NPC17731 could not be cross-linked either to the WT or mutant receptors under any conditions. When taken into consideration with the lack of effect of mutation of the aspartates in EC-IV on NPC17731 binding (13Freedman R. Jarnagin K. Fritz H. Muller-Esterl W. Jochum M. Roscher A. Luppertz K. Recent Progress on Kinins. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1992: 487-496Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), these results suggest that antagonist binding to the B2 receptor involves at least some determinants that are different from those involved in agonist binding.

This protein, isolated from purified lysosome membranes, is a peripheral membrane protein with an ATP-dependent microtubule binding activity. We have produced antibodies against the purified 50-kDa protein to investigate its role in the association of lysosomes to microtubules using a cell-free reconstitution assay and cell microinjection. Pretreatment of purified lysosomes with the antibodies inhibited the association of these vesicles to microtubules.

Affinity-purified antibodies microinjected into intact cells altered the distribution of lysosomes that appeared less clustered in the vicinity of nuclei. The antibody-induced lysosome dispersion was assessed by quantitative videomicroscope analyses.

This membrane-bound isoform of glutamate dehydrogenase could be involved in the microtubule-dependent perinuclear localization of lysosomes. It is generally accepted that the distribution and the intracellular motion of organelles, among which are endosomes and lysosomes, require the integrity of the microtubule network. In polarized cells, the movement of endosomal vesicles from the cell periphery to the perinuclear region of the cell is abolished after a treatment with microtubule inhibitors (1Matteoni R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1253-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 2DeBrabander M. Nuydens R. Gurts H. Hopkins C.R. Cell Motil.

Thus, the endocytic vesicles move centripetally in a microtubule-dependent manner in order to deliver their content to lysosomes (4Kelly R.B. Cell. 1990; 61: 5-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 5Schroer T.A. Sheetz M.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The key microtubule-dependent step could be the transfer of material via carrier vesicles into late endosomes (6Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J.

Microtubules play also a key role in the clustering of late endosomes or prelysosomes and lysosomes in the perinuclear region of the cell (1Matteoni R. Kreis T.E. J.

In most cells, prelysosomes and lysosomes accumulate around the nucleus, often in a region near the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). 1The abbreviations used are: MTOCmicrotubule-organizing centerGDHglutamate dehydrogenaseMP50membrane protein of 50 kDaNRSnormal rabbit serumSLPsoluble lysosomal proteinArs-Aarylsulfatase APBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonicPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The positioning of lysosomes depends on their association to microtubules. When microtubules are depolymerized by a treatment of cells with nocodazole, lysosomes disperse into the cytoplasm. Upon removal of the microtubule disrupting agent, microtubules progressively reassemble from the MTOC, and lysosomes return to their normal perinuclear localization. When cells are treated with taxol, after removal of nocodazole, microtubules reassemble as short filaments over the entire cytoplasm, without relation to the MTOC, and lysosomes remain scattered throughout the cell (10Rousset B. Mithieux G. Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. Structure and Functions of the Cytoskeleton. John Libbey Eurotext, Paris1988: 313-323Google Scholar). Microtubules are also required for the formation of tubular extensions from endosomes and lysosomes (9Swanson J. Bushnell A. Silverstein S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 14Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G.

Rousset B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 971: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), interaction of lysosomes and prelysosomes with microtubules could bring into play two types of microtubule-binding proteins, organelle linker and cytoplasmic motor proteins. The microtubule-based motor proteins, kinesin (anterograde motor) and cytoplasmic dynein (retrograde motor), are involved in the endosomal vesicles or lysosomes movement along microtubules (16Schroer T.A. Schnapp B.J. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Schroer T.A. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P.

In polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, the microtubule-dependent fusion of either apical or basolateral endosomes requires kinesin and dynein (7Bomsel M. Parton R. Kuznetsov S.A. Schroer T.A. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1990; 62: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Kinesin is also involved in the formation of tubular extensions of lysosomes in macrophages (19Hollenbeck P.J. Swanson J.A.

Proteins mediating “stable” interactions between endosomes or lysosomes and microtubules have been identified in cell-free reconstitution assays (26Mithieux G. Audebet C. Rousset B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Scheel J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 27: 18141-18148Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Proteins of the vesicle membrane could play the role of anchoring factors of the vesicles onto microtubules. The binding of endocytic carrier vesicles to microtubules depends on a microtubule-binding protein, CLIP-170 (28Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which is not a motor protein (27Scheel J. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 27: 18141-18148Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). CLIP-170, colocalized in vivo with endocytic vesicles, could be involved in the capture of early endosomes by microtubules (29Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The ATP-sensitive binding of this protein to microtubules is regulated by phosphorylation (30Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17597-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another protein, MP50 (membrane protein of 50 kDa), was proposed as a factor of anchoring of lysosomes to microtubules (31Mithieux G. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4664-4668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MP50, isolated from highly purified preparations of prelysosomes and lysosomes (32Alquier C. Guenin P. Munari-Silem Y. Audebet C. Rousset B. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Selmi S. Rousset B. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), exhibits an ATP-dependent microtubule binding activity. This protein has been identified to a membrane-bound isoform of a ubiquitous enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (34Rajas F. Rousset B. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MP50 is a peripheral membrane protein with the same isoelectric point as the isoprotein 2 of GDH. The present study aims at demonstrating that MP50 present on the lysosome/prelysosome membrane is involved in the association of lysosomes and prelysosomes to microtubules and that MP50 could contribute to the maintenance of these organelles in the perinuclear region of the cells. We have raised polyclonal antibodies against MP50 and used them to block the activity of potential microtubule binding sites on lysosome membranes. Studies have been conducted in a cell-free reconstitution assay (26Mithieux G. Audebet C. Rousset B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and in intact cells using cell microinjection of affinity-purified antibodies. We also raised anti-GDH antibodies to differentiate the properties and/or functions of the membrane-bound form of GDH, i.e. MP50, from those of soluble GDH. MP50 was purified from pig liver vesicle membranes according to the method described by Mithieux and Rousset (31Mithieux G. Rousset B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4664-4668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), slightly modified by Rajas and Rousset (34Rajas F. Rousset B. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified liver MP50 and purified GDH from bovine liver (Sigma) were labeled with Na125I using lactoperoxidase and glucose-glucose oxidase as the H2O2 generating system, as described previously (34Rajas F. Rousset B. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of the labeled proteins were 2-5 μCi/μg of protein. Two polyclonal anti-MP50 immune sera (Ab1 and Ab2) and one polyclonal anti-GDH immune serum (Ab3) were produced from New Zealand White male rabbits by multipoint subcutaneous injections of 500 μg of liver MP50 or purified bovine liver GDH (Sigma) in 1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant. After 3 weeks, rabbits were given a booster injection. Blood was collected every 48 h, starting 5 days after the second injection, and sera were stored at −20°C. The IgG fractions were purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate and anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Sera and IgG fractions were tested for their antibody titer and specificity by soluble phase radioimmunoassay. 125I-Labeled protein (MP50 or GDH) (40,000 cpm/tube, about 5 ng) was incubated with the immune serum in the absence or in the presence of unlabeled protein (MP50 or GDH) (1-10,000 ng) in a total volume of 500 μl of 10 mM phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, PBS buffer containing 10 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4. Incubation was carried out for 1 h at 37°C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation (1,500 × g for 15 min) after a 45-min incubation with protein A adsorbent (Staphylococcus aureus, Pansorbin, Calbiochem) at room temperature. Immunoprecipitated 125I-protein was measured in a Packard Instruments γ counter. Anti-MP50 IgG was purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized MP50. Purified MP50 (200-250 μg of protein/ml of packed gel) was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of a succinylated aminoalkyl-agarose gel from Bio-Rad) as indicated by the manufacturer. The coupling efficiency was 80-90%. The IgG fraction purified from the immune sera was incubated with MP50/Affi-Gel 10 matrix (1 mg of IgG/ml of packed gel) for 4 h at 4°C under gentle agitation. The gel was then packed in a column, and the incubation solution was recycled 5 times. After extensive washing with PBS, bound IgG was eluted from the column with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5. Fractions were collected in 1 M Tris base (containing 20 mg/ml BSA) to obtain a neutral pH. Fractions containing anti-MP50 antibodies were pooled and stored at −20°C. Microtubule proteins were purified from pig brain by two cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization-depolymerization using the procedure of Shelanski et al. (37Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). Purification was carried out in buffer A (100 mM MES, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM GTP, pH 6.4) supplemented with 4 M glycerol and 1 mM GTP in polymerizing steps. Twice-cycled microtubule proteins were radioiodinated by conjugation with the 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Corp., Les Ulis, France) according to the method of Carlier et al. (38Carlier M-F. Simon C. Pantaloni D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Polymerization-competent labeled microtubule proteins were selected by an additional assembly-dissassembly cycle, as described previously (26Mithieux G. Audebet C. Rousset B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of the labeled protein was 0.1-0.2 μCi/μg of microtubule protein. More than 95% of 125I-labeled iodine was recovered on tubulin and equally distributed between α- and β-subunits. Lysosomes/prelysosomes were purified from pig thyroid glands by differential and isopycnic centrifugations on Percoll gradient (32Alquier C. Guenin P. Munari-Silem Y. Audebet C. Rousset B. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Selmi S. Rousset B. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) prepared in hypertonic sucrose medium (26Mithieux G. Audebet C. Rousset B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purified lysosomes/prelysosomes (1.5 mg of protein) were incubated with immune sera or the corresponding purified IgG fractions or affinity-purified anti-MP50 antibodies in 4 ml of 10 mM Tris/HCl, 0.5 M sucrose, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 20°C. Normal rabbit serum or purified IgG (from preimmune sera) were used as controls. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Lysosomes were washed by resuspending the pellets in the same buffer and were sedimented by centrifugation. The final lysosome/prelysosome pellets were resuspended in the reconstitution assay medium, i.e. buffer A, containing 0.5 M sucrose (buffer B) to obtain a final concentration of 1.2-1.4 mg of protein/ml. Radiolabeled microtubules were prepared by mixing unlabeled microtubule protein with 125I-labeled tubulin in buffer B. The specific radioactivity of 125I-labeled microtubule protein ranged from 100 to 150 cpm/μg. After 30 min of incubation at 37°C in the presence of 1 mM GTP, microtubules were sheared by five passages through a 25 G needle of a syringe and kept for 5 min at 25°C. Aliquots of the lysosome/prelysosome suspension (0.12 mg of protein) preequilibrated at 25°C for 5 min were mixed with preassembled labeled microtubules (0.2-1.2 mg of protein) and incubated for 30 min at 25°C. Experiments were carried out in a total volume of 200 μl of buffer B. At the end of the incubation period, the lysosome-microtubule mixture was layered on a 100-μl sucrose cushion (buffer A + 0.75 M sucrose), placed in an Eppendorf tube, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to separate free from lysosome-bound microtubules. The supernatant containing free microtubules and the cushion were removed, and the pellet (containing lysosomes and microtubule-lysosome complexes) was counted for radioactivity. The amount of microtubules recovered in the pellet was calculated from radioactivity measurements and the specific radioactivity of microtubule protein. Lysosomes/prelysosomes (0.05 mg of protein) were incubated with preassembled microtubules (0.2 mg) in a total volume of 0.5 ml of buffer B for 30 min at 25°C. Aliquots of 20 μl of the reconstitution mixtures were laid as drops on Parafilm. Grids (400 mesh), previously coated with Formvar and carbon, were placed upside down on the drops for 1 min at room temperature. Subsequent treatments and washings were carried out by transferring grids from drop to drop of different solutions. Material adsorbed on the grids was first washed with buffer B and then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in buffer B for 1 min. After two washings in water (1 min each), grids were negatively stained for 1 min with 2% uranyl acetate in water and finally air-dried. Grids were examined in a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope (Center Commun de Microscopie Electronique, Faculté de Médecine Lyon-RTH Laënnec, Lyon, France). Thyroid cells, isolated from pig thyroid glands by a discontinuous trypsin treatment, were cultured in F-12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum in Petri dishes under 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C (39Munari-Silem Y. Mesnil M. Selmi S. Bernier-Valentin F. Rabilloud R. Rousset B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells cultured at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2 formed monolayers. After 3 days of culture, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with the first antibody. The antibodies used were: Ab1, Ab2, Ab3, polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against soluble lysosomal proteins (SLP) (10Rousset B. Mithieux G. Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. Structure and Functions of the Cytoskeleton. John Libbey Eurotext, Paris1988: 313-323Google Scholar) or against arylsulfatase A (Ars-A) (40Selmi S. Maire I. Rousset B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 41Kostrouch Z. Munari-Silem Y. Rajas F. Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2202-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or a monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (Amersham). Immune complexes were detected using either goat anti-mouse Ig antibodies conjugated to rhodamine or donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibodies conjugated to Texas Red (Amersham) for 30 min at room temperature. Observations were made using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence images, taken with a silicon intensified target camera (LHESA, Cergy Pontoise, France), were transferred to a crystal sapphire image processor (Quantel, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). Numerized images were stored in a Bernoulli box for subsequent analysis. Photomicrographs were obtained using a UP-5000 P video printer from Sony (Tokyo, Japan). To visualize mitochondria, living cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml rhodamine 123 (Sigma) in F-12 medium. After 30 min at room temperature, cells were washed three times and observed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with the filter combination used for fluorescein. Affinity-purified anti-MP50 IgG or control IgG were dialyzed against a 5-fold diluted microinjection buffer (2 mM phosphate, 29 mM KCl, pH 7.0) overnight at 4°C and then concentrated 5 times using a SpeedVac concentrator. The microinjected solutions contained antibodies at a concentration of 5 mg/ml and BSA-Lucifer Yellow conjugate (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml used to identify the injected cells. Before microinjection, the solutions were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Microinjection was performed on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 35M from Zeiss) using a micromanipulator 5170 and a microinjector 5242 from Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). The procedure for microinjection in the cytoplasm was similar to that described by Munari-Silem et al. (39Munari-Silem Y. Mesnil M. Selmi S. Bernier-Valentin F. Rabilloud R. Rousset B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 414-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thyroid cells cultured as monolayer in a Petri dish (6 cm in diameter) were penetrated by the capillary in the vicinity of the nucleus. The microinjected volume (10-50 fl) remained below 10% of the cell volume. The concentration of IgG in the cytoplasm should range from 1 to 6 μM. Microinjections were made at room temperature within a time interval of 15-20 min in order to prevent changes in medium pH. After injection, the culture medium was changed, and cells were incubated at 20°C under 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 h. At the end of the incubation period, cells were fixed and immunostained for lysosomes with anti-SLP antibodies (10Rousset B. Mithieux G. Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. Structure and Functions of the Cytoskeleton. John Libbey Eurotext, Paris1988: 313-323Google Scholar) as mentioned above. Immune complexes were detected using donkey anti-rabbit Ig antibodies conjugated to Texas Red (Amersham). Fluorescence images, taken with the silicon intensified target camera installed on the Zeiss Axiophot microscope, were analyzed using the crystal sapphire image processor mentioned above and a built-in program for surface and luminance analyses. The parameters were obtained as follows. The outlines of the microinjected cell defined by Lucifer Yellow fluorescence were delimited on a screen by an optical pen device. The surface (number of pixels) of the delimited field, as well as the average luminance (fluorescence intensity) of the field, were automatically obtained. The surface in which Texas Red-labeled lysosomes were found and the mean luminance of this surface were determined in the same way. The ratio between the surface containing the lysosomes and the total surface of the cell was taken as a parameter of lysosome dispersion. This videomicroscope double fluorescence analysis was performed, in double-blind, on two separate experiments. In each experiment, 40-50 cells in 8-10 different Petri dishes were microinjected with affinity-purified anti-MP50 or control IgGs. Fluorescence measurements were made on Lucifer Yellow-labeled cells taken at random. The values of surface and luminance were ordered according to the internal code of the experiment, and the corresponding means ± S.E. were calculated for each group of cells. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's t test. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) on 9% acrylamide slab minigels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride/Immobilon membrane. The membrane was preincubated in PBS containing 2% (w/v) fat-free dry milk, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at 20°C and then incubated with anti-MP50 or anti-GDH antibodies diluted in the PBS/milk/Tween buffer. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using goat anti-rabbit Igs conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) in the PBS/milk/Tween buffer and bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium as substrate (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Two rabbit immune sera raised against purified MP50 (Ab1 and Ab2) and one immune serum raised against purified GDH (Ab3) were tested for their antibody titer in soluble phase radioimmunoassay using 125I-labeled MP50 or 125I-labeled GDH as antigen. The antibody titer (defined as the highest dilution of the immune serum giving a signal significantly higher than that of the preimmune serum) was 1:3,000, 1:10,000, and 1:30,000 for Ab1, Ab2, and Ab3, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The relative affinity of these antibodies for MP50 and GDH was studied by competitive binding experiments. The binding of 125I-labeled MP50 to Ab1 and Ab2 was decreased by increasing amounts of unlabeled MP50 (Fig. 1C). The apparent affinity of Ab2 antibodies was about 5-fold higher than that of the Ab1 antibodies. The binding of 125I-labeled MP50 to either Ab1 or Ab2 antibodies was also inhibited by unlabeled GDH. The reactivities of Ab1 and Ab2 antibodies toward GDH and MP50 were almost the same. Binding of 125I-labeled GDH to Ab3 antibodies was affected differently by GDH and MP50 (Fig. 1D). The competition curves were not parallel; this indicates that GDH and MP50 present distinct epitopes. Fifty-fold more MP50 than GDH was required to decrease the binding of 125I-labeled GDH to Ab3 antibodies by 50%. Fig. 2B shows that Ab1 antibodies reacted with both MP50 and GDH on a Western blot and only labeled a 50-kDa band when tested on thyroid lysosome/prelysosome membrane preparations. This band corresponds to the MP50 initially identified, purified, and characterized from these purified organelles (Fig. 2A). Ab2 antibodies were unable to detect any molecular species on the Western blot (data not shown), and thus, the specificity of these antibodies could not be documented. Ab3 antibodies reacted with both GDH and MP50, and as observed with Ab1 antibodies, Ab3 antibodies recognized a single band of 50 kDa in thyroid lysosome/prelysosome membrane preparations (Fig. 2C). Lysosomes/prelysosomes used in this study were purified 50-75-fold (as compared with tissue homogenate) on the basis of acid phosphatase activity measurements. Purified organelles with a buoyant density from 1.08 to about 1.12 g/ml and higher than 1.12 g/ml correspond to secondary lysosomes or prelysosomes and lysosomes, respectively; their biochemical and morphological characteristics have been previously described (32Alquier C.

Prelysosomes have been defined as organelles positive for cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and arylsulfatase-A (Ars-A), and lysosomes have been identified as mannose 6-phosphate receptor-negative but Ars-A-positive organelles (41Kostrouch Z.

We have previously shown that they mediate the transcriptional activation by the largest E1a protein and can heterodimerize with members of the Jun/Fos family.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 11: 355-377Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar); the binding and trans-activation properties of all these proteins have been extensively studied. They belong to the family of “b-Zip” (basic-leucine zipper) proteins, which have a basic region in their C termini, rich in positively charged amino acids, flanked by a leucine zipper motif, and responsible both for sequence-specific DNA binding and protein dimerization (4Landschulz W.H.

Many of these ATF/CREB factors have been found heterodimerized with members of the AP1 family (6Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sassone-Corsi P.

Although these ATFa proteins had no detectable intrinsic trans-activation function, a transcriptional activation domain was identified after removal of C-terminal sequences. This cryptic activation domain comprises an essential N-terminal zinc-binding element, which, together with sequences located within the 170 C-terminal residues of the ATFa proteins, also contributes to the interaction of ATFa with the E1a oncoprotein. As expected, both N- and C-terminal ATFa elements are instrumental in mediating E1a responsiveness of target promoters (15Chatton B. Bocco J.L. Gaire M. Hauss C. Reimund B. Goetz J. Kedinger C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that the ATFa proteins can associate with c-Jun or c-Fos proteins and that they bind TPA response element sequences only when heterodimerized with members of the Jun family (10Chatton B. Bocco J.L. Goetz J. Gaire M. Lutz Y. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chatton B. Bahr A. Acker J. Kedinger C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 142-145PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that ATFa proteins were tightly associated with protein kinase activities and that this binding occurred both in vitro and in a cellular environment. We have shown that these kinase activities have properties related to specific members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (18Bocco J.L. Bahr A. Goetz J. Hauss C. Kallunki T. Kedinger C. Chatton B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1971-1980PubMed Google Scholar). One of these kinases is the c-Jun N-terminus-associated kinase 2 (JNK2), a kinase that binds to N-terminal regions of ATF-2 and ATFa (18Bocco J.L. Bahr A. Goetz J. Hauss C. Kallunki T. Kedinger C. Chatton B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1971-1980PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 20Dai T. Rubie E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ATF-2 plays important roles in the early events of signaling pathways, as phosphorylation of this factor by the c-Jun N-terminus-associated kinases increases its trans-activating properties and permits the early activation of the c-jun promoter (22Vandam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarity to ATF-2, it is presently unclear whether the ATFa proteins serve similar functions in the cell, particularly because they display no transcriptional activity on their own. As a step toward understanding the cellular functions of the ATFa proteins and their connections with the ATF-2 and c-Jun factors, we undertook the cloning of the genomic ATFa sequences and the study of their expression. The structure and chromosomal location of the ATFa gene and promoter were determined. Our results indicate that the different ATFa isoforms arise by alternative splicing through differential splice donor usage and that these proteins are targeted to the cell nucleus by a bipartite nuclear localization sequence that is part of the basic region of the protein. While low levels of ATFa mRNAs appeared to be expressed rather ubiquitously in the adult mouse, enhanced expression was observed in particular tissues during embryonic development. In situ hybridization was carried out on chromosome preparations obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes. A recombinant pBluescript plasmid containing an ATFa cDNA fragment (1449 bp) was tritium-labeled by nick translation to a specific activity of ∼1.6 × 108 dpm/μg and was used as probe. The hybridization procedure was carried out essentially as described previously (23Mattei M.G. Baeteman M.A. Heilig R. Oberle I. Davies K. Mandel J.L. Mattei J.F. Hum. Genet. 1985; 69: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A human placental genomic DNA library (constructed by J.-M. Garnier in λGEM 12) was screened by hybridization with a random-primed 32P-labeled ATFa3 cDNA probe using conventional cloning methods (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA inserts were recovered from positive recombinant phages by restriction digestion and subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the chain termination method (68Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers derived from appropriate regions of the known ATFa cDNA sequence. A 300-bp cDNA fragment was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from poly(A)+ RNA from mouse P19 cells (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used for the reaction bracketed a region unique to ATFa (when compared with other members of the family), spanning positions +803 to +1102 of the human ATFa cDNA and located just 5′ to the basic-leucine zipper motif (b-Zip). The resulting 300-bp fragment was inserted into the EcoRV site of pBluescript and sequenced, revealing a 92% identity to its human homolog at the nucleotide level. Subcloning of the ATFa gene promoter region was performed as follows. An 11-kb SacI insert was recovered from a positive recombinant phage and cloned into pBluescript SK. A 6.5-kb ApaI fragment containing the first exon, upstream sequences, and part of the first intron of the ATFa gene was directly subcloned into the ApaI site of pBluescript SK. This recombinant plasmid was further processed by excising an XbaI fragment comprising the most 5′-portion of the ATFa gene upstream sequences and was mutagenized by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to remove the intronic sequences and to create a SacI restriction site at the end of the first exon. A 2-kb SacI fragment containing the first exon and upstream sequences of the ATFa gene (between positions −1917 and +83, with respect to the transcription start site) was then subcloned, in both orientations, in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene of a promoterless vector (pBLCAT6) (26Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), generating the −1917/+83 CAT and +83/−1917 CAT recombinants. From the −1917/+83 CAT recombinant, a series of additional deletions were constructed by restriction digestion (giving rise to −62/+83 CAT and −212/+83 CAT), by PCR amplification of specific promoter fragments followed by subcloning into the same host vector (giving rise to −23/+83 CAT and +8/+83 CAT), or by progressive exonuclease III-directed unilateral deletions of upstream sequences between positions −1917 and −797 (generating −1719/+83 CAT, −1591/+83 CAT, −1467/+83 CAT, −1211/+83 CAT, −1051/+83 CAT, and −797/+83 CAT). The above-mentioned 2-kb SacI fragment was also subcloned in both orientations into a blunt-ended XbaI site at position −9 of a rabbit β-globin reporter gene of the PAL4 vector (27Ponglikitmongkol M. White J.H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2221-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), generating the −1917/+83 Glob and +83/−1917 Glob recombinants. The GST-ATFa derivatives were constructed as described previously (18Bocco J.L. Bahr A. Goetz J. Hauss C. Kallunki T. Kedinger C. Chatton B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1971-1980PubMed Google Scholar) by inserting the ATFa3 cDNA or selected fragments thereof into the pBC expression vector (17Chatton B. Bahr A. Acker J. Kedinger C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 142-145PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-SVTNLS recombinant, which contains a 30-bp oligonucleotide encoding the NLS element of the SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKVEDP) (28Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. J. Ménissier de Murcia (CNRS, Strasbourg, France). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum and 2.5% newborn calf serum. 16 h after plating, the cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (29Banerji J. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Cell. 1981; 27: 299-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) with the amounts of supercoiled recombinant DNA indicated in the figure legends, adjusted to 13 μg/9-cm Petri dish with double-stranded carrier DNA (pBluescript). The medium was changed after 15 h, and cells were harvested after an additional 24 h. Extracts were prepared, and aliquots (normalized by protein concentration) were assayed for CAT activity as described previously (30Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar, 31Webster N.J. Green S. Tasset D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Each transfection experiment was repeated at least three times with different plasmid preparations. Percent acetylation of chloramphenicol was determined by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated with a Bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Total RNA from various cell lines and tissues was prepared using the single step guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol procedure (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was subsequently purified on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, this RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized with random-primed 32P-labeled ATFa3 or actin cDNA probes at 42°C in buffer containing 5 × SSC and 50% formamide. Filters were washed at 25°C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS and exposed for autoradiography. Transcription start sites on the ATFa gene were mapped by RNase protection, reverse transcriptase primer extension, and S1 nuclease mapping essentially as described (32Ausubuel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). RNase protection mapping was carried out by hybridizing HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA to a uniformly 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe produced as a T3 polymerase transcript of a pBluescript recombinant harboring a PCR-generated −153/+83 fragment of the ATFa gene. Reverse transcriptase primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping were carried out with total RNA from transfected HeLa cells. In the case of reverse transcriptase primer extension mapping, a synthetic oligonucleotide spanning the ATFa transcribed strand from positions +51 to +81 was used as primer for the reverse transcriptase reaction. The same oligonucleotide was also used to sequence the −1917/+83 CAT template, providing a size reference sequence ladder. For S1 nuclease mapping, the probe was a single-stranded DNA fragment that was produced by extension of the 5′-end-labeled +51/+81 oligonucleotide with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) using the heat-denatured −1917/+83 CAT recombinant plasmid as template. After cleavage with XmnI (position −427), the resulting single-stranded product (−427/+81) was recovered and purified by gel electrophoresis. HeLa whole cell extracts (10 μg) were mixed with the PCR-generated −153/+83 fragment of the ATFa gene (32P-5′-end-labeled on either the transcribed or nontranscribed strand; ∼10,000 cpm) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 100 ng of poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, and 40 mM ammonium sulfate. After preincubation for 10 min at 25°C, 2 μl of DNase I solutions (at 100, 40, 20, or 10 μg/ml) were added to the mixture and further incubated for 2 min at 25°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.4 ml of a mixture containing 0.5% SDS, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, and 50 μg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA. The DNase-resistant fragments were purified and separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Whole cell extracts from adult mouse tissues and nuclear extracts from 11.5-17.5-day-old mouse embryos were prepared (33Gaub M.P. Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Ali S. Matthes H. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Mendelsohn C. Mark M. Dollé P. Dierich A. Gaub M.P. Krust A. Lampron C. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 246-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the ATFa proteins were revealed by immunoblotting essentially as described (10Chatton B. Bocco J.L. Goetz J. Gaire M. Lutz Y. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar) with a monoclonal antibody directed against bacterially expressed ATFa3 (monoclonal antibody 1A7; used at 1:5000). Specific protein-antibody complexes were revealed using a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse κ-light chain secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), followed by treatment with the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The organs collected from adult mice were frozen in 2-metylbutane maintained on dry ice. A 300-bp mouse ATFa cDNA fragment cloned into pBluescript (see above) was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 35S-CTP to generate an antisense riboprobe. Hybridization was carried out on cryosections as described (35Décimo D. Georges-Labouesse E. Dollé P. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Probes II: A Practical Approach. Vol. 2. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 183-190Google Scholar), providing a higher signal-to-noise ratio, although with a somewhat poorer histology. Emulsion autoradiography was for 4 months. Monolayer COS-7 cells (grown on glass coverslips) were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 1 μg of recombinant vector or pBC parental vector, together with 3.5 μg of double-stranded pBluescript carrier DNA/tube. The medium was changed after 20 h, and the day after, the cells were washed in PBS and treated for 4 min at room temperature with 2% formaldehyde in PBS. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized by two treatments with PT buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min. After a 30-min treatment with blocking solution (2% nonfat dry milk in PBS), the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-GST primary monoclonal antibody (EuroMedex, Paris, France) diluted in PT buffer, washed three times in PT buffer, incubated with a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and washed in PT buffer. The preparations were mounted in glycerol/PBS (4:1) containing 5% propyl gallate, and observations were made with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Microphot FXA). To determine the genomic localization of the ATFa sequences, in situ hybridizations on human metaphase chromosomes were performed (Fig. 1). In the 100 metaphase cells examined after hybridization, 199 silver grains were associated with chromosomes, and 67 of these (33.6%) were located on chromosome 12. The grain distribution was not random since 89.5% (60/67) of the grains counted on chromosome 12 mapped to position 12q12-14, with a maximum in band 12q13. It is noteworthy that the gene encoding the related ATF-1 factor (36Desmaze C. Zucman J. Delattre O. Melot T. Thomas G. Aurias A. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) also maps within this locus. A human genomic library was screened at elevated stringency with the largest cDNA of the ATFa family. A number of positive clones were picked, characterized by Southern blot analysis, and subcloned. Partial sequence determination of the genomic clones and comparison with the previously established cDNA sequence (14Gaire M. Chatton B. Kedinger C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3467-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) allowed us to position the introns and to establish the gene structure. As depicted in Fig. 2, the ATFa gene (∼60 kb in length) comprises a leader (A) and 11 exons (B-L), all of which are <200 bp, except exon L, which exceeds 8000 bp and contains a large untranslated region of nearly 8 kb. The translation initiation and termination codons of the ATFa open reading frame are in exons B and L, respectively. The lengths of the 11 introns have not been precisely determined, but were estimated to have a mean size of ∼4 kb each. The sequences at the exon/intron junctions were in very good agreement with the consensus sequences around both splice donor and acceptor sites (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Exon/intron organization of the ATFa gene. A, the sequences at each exon/intron junction (used to generate the ATFa3 mRNA) are aligned, with exonic nucleotides shaded and nucleotides identical to the consensus sequence (67Reynolds G.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1159-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), differing from each other by specific sequence elements within the coding region (Fig. 3B): ATFa3 corresponds to the largest cDNA resulting from the juxtaposition of all elements boxed in Fig. 2; ATFa2 lacks a 33-bp element (element d); ATFa1 lacks both element d and an additional 63-bp element (element e); and ATFa0 lacks element d and exons F-I. The existence of cytoplasmic transcripts corresponding to these ATFa variants was confirmed by PCR-mediated analysis of HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA (16Pescini R. Kaszubska W. Whelan J. De Lamarter J.F. van Huijsduijnen R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1159-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2J. Goetz, unpublished observation. demonstrating the physiological relevance of these variants. These observations indicate that the various isoforms most likely result from differential splicing of a unique ATFa primary transcript. Thus, exons F-I correspond to alternative exons. Furthermore, examination of the nucleotide sequences at the 5′-border of elements d and e revealed strong homologies to the consensus splice donor sequence (Fig. 3C), suggesting that these sequences constitute alternative splice donor sites (DS1) that can be used in place of the donor sites located at the 3′-border of these elements (DS2). Nothing is known at present about the control of this splice donor site usage and the underlying mechanism. As a first step toward the delineation of the promoter region of the ATFa gene, we determined the transcription start sites. An RNase protection experiment performed with HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 4B) clearly identified one minor and two major start sites, arbitrarily denoted −43, −22, and +1, respectively, within the 5′-region of the ATFa leader (exon A). Transcription initiation around position −22 seems to be less precise, as indicated by the slight scattering of the start sites in this area. The position of this initiation region is compatible with the coordinates of the most 5′-extending ATFa cDNA originally isolated (14Gaire M. Chatton B. Kedinger C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3467-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), starting at position +8. Examination of the nucleotide sequences located upstream of the transcription start sites did not reveal a typical TATA box. Instead, a significantly higher GC content (70%) was apparent between positions +1 and −140, which, together with the relative spreading of initiation sites, is a characteristic of promoters of housekeeping genes (37Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). To test for the presence of promoter sequences within the sequences located upstream of the ATFa leader, a vector harboring ATFa sequences between positions −1917 and +83 was transfected into HeLa cells. To ensure stable RNA synthesis, the ATFa sequences were linked to a promoterless rabbit β-globin gene. Specific transcription was investigated by S1 nuclease mapping and reverse transcriptase primer extension of total RNA prepared from the transfected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, transcripts that initiated at positions +1, −22, and −43 were detected in cells transfected with the ATFa/globin vector in which the ATFa sequences were in the sense orientation (lanes 5 and 7). No transcription could be detected from a vector harboring the ATFa sequences in the antisense orientation with respect to the globin sequences (lanes 6 and 8). These results not only confirm the positions of the start sites of the ATFa gene, but indicate that the isolated ATFa 2-kb upstream sequences carry sufficient information to direct efficient transcription from the transfected construct. To more precisely delineate the essential promoter region of the ATFa gene, larger deletions were created at the 5′-side of the −1917/+83 ATFa gene fragment. The truncated segments were inserted in front of the bacterial CAT coding sequences, and their capacity to"

In a previous study we reported that a 110-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase is constitutively associated with the IL-3R and activated following IL-3 stimulation. We now report that a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) 5-phosphatase (5-ptase) is also constitutively associated with the IL-3R. This 5-ptase is magnesium-dependent and removes the 5-position phosphate from PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 but does not metabolize PtdIns-4,5-P2, inositol (Ins)-1,3,4,5-P4, or Ins-1,4,5-P3. This substrate specificity distinguishes it from any previously characterized 5-ptase. Interestingly, it may be bound indirectly via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), another enzyme that is constitutively bound to the IL-3R. However, unlike PI 3-kinase which becomes activated following IL-3 stimulation, this receptor-associated 5-ptase activity does not increase following IL-3 stimulation, and its primary function may be to keep the principal in vivo product of PI 3-kinase, PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, at low levels in unstimulated cells, to terminate the PI 3-kinase signal following IL-3 stimulation or to metabolize PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 to a metabolically active second messenger, i.e. PtdIns-3,4-P2.

It exerts its action by binding to specific cell surface receptors on its target cells (1Krystal G. Alai M. Cutler R.L. Dickeson Mui L.-F. Wognum A.W. Hematol. Pathol. 1991; 5: 141-162PubMed Google Scholar, 2Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cell surface receptors are members of the hemopoietic receptor superfamily (2Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and consist of two subunits, designated α and β (2Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 70-kDa α subunit is specific for IL-3 (3Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), while the 140-kDa β subunit (βc) is shared by IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 (4Gorman D.M. Itoh N. Kitamura T. Schreurs J. Yonehara S. Yahara I. Arai K.-I. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5459-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the mouse, there is a second β subunit called βIL-3 which shares 91% amino acid identity with βc and is specific for IL-3 (5Itoh N. Yonehara S. Schreurs J. Gorman D.M. Maruyama K. Ishii A. Yahara I. Arai K.-I. Miyajima A. Science. 1990; 247: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although neither the α nor the β subunits possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, the IL-3R β subunits, as well as several other intracellular proteins, rapidly become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following IL-3 stimulation (6Duronio V.

Blood. 1992; 79: 2880-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is mediated, at least in part, by a constitutively associated tyrosine kinase, Jak2 (15Harpur A.G. Andres A.-C. Ziemiecki A. Aston R.R. Wilks A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1347-1353PubMed Google Scholar), that becomes activated following IL-3 binding (16Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T.

To gain further insight into the signaling pathways activated, and inactivated, by the binding of IL-3, we and others have recently set out to identify proteins that are intimately associated with the IL-3R itself. To date these studies have shown that the tyrosine-specific phosphatase, hematopoietic cell phosphatase, also known as PTP1C, SHP1, or SHPTP1, associates with the IL-3R β subunit following IL-3 stimulation (17Yi T. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). This phosphatase is most likely responsible for the dephosphorylation of Jak2 and the IL-3R and for the subsequent down-regulation of the response of hemopoietic cells to IL-3 (17Yi T. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel 110-kDa Ser/Thr kinase has been found to constitutively associate with the IL-3R and become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-3 (19Liu L. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22422-22427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This kinase may be involved in the extensive serine/threonine phosphorylation of the IL-3R that occurs following IL-3 stimulation (10Liu L. Cutler R.L. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. J. Biol.

Recently, we discovered that a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5- trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) 5-phosphatase (5-ptase), which we have designated SHIP, for SH2-containing inositol phosphatase, becomes associated with Shc following IL-3 stimulation (20Damen J.E.

Since Shc has been shown to bind to many cell surface receptors following growth factor stimulation (21Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmüller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Blood. 1993; 82: 2296-2303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether this 5-ptase could also be associating with the IL-3R following IL-3 stimulation. Unexpectedly, we found a 5-ptase was indeed associated with the IL-3R but it was not SHIP. Rather, it was a previously uncharacterized PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-specific 5-ptase that associates constitutively with the IL-3R and is most likely bound to this receptor indirectly, via PI 3-kinase. This is the first demonstration of a 5-ptase being associated with a cell surface receptor, and, given its specificity for the major in vivo product of PI 3-kinase, it most likely plays an important role in regulating PI 3-kinase-mediated events. The production and purification of COS cell-derived murine IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were as described previously (27Mui A.L.-F. Kay R.J. Humphries R.K. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16523-16530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum to the human IL-3R βc subunit was generated by immunizing animals with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the entire intracellular domain of the hIL-3R βc subunit. This antiserum is highly effective at immunopecipitating the murine IL-3R βc and βIL-3 subunits (10Liu L. Cutler R.L. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16774-16779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) mAb, 4G10, and rabbit polyclonal antiserum to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) were purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Both affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Shc (for immunoprecipitations) and mAb to Shc (for Western blotting) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Protein-grade Nonidet P-40 was from Calbiochem. The enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting reagents were obtained from Pierce. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Murine B6SUtA1 cells, maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 ng/ml GM-CSF, were deprived of growth factors for 12 h at 37°C in RPMI 1640 containing 1% fetal calf serum and then stimulated at 37°C for 5 min with murine IL-3 (400 ng/ml). The cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline solubilized at 2 × 107 cells/ml with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 4°C phosphorylation solubilization buffer, i.e. 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM NaPPi, 2 mM Na3VO4, 4 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described previously (26Damen J.E. Liu L. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Blood. 1993; 82: 2296-2303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PtdIns-3,4,5-[32P]P3 was prepared using PtdIns-4,5-P2, [γ-32P]ATP (11 Ci/mmol), and recombinant PtdIns 3-kinase provided by Dr. L. T. Williams (Chiron Corp.) (28Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 269: 100-102Crossref Scopus (514) Google Scholar). 5-ptase activity was measured using sonicated vesicles containing 30,000 cpm of TLC-purified PtdIns-3,4,5-[32P]P3 with 150 μg of phosphatidylserine in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing immunoprecipitate or 5-ptase II, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and substrate were rocked for 30 min at 37°C. Reactions were stopped, and the products were separated by TLC (29Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proof that the 32P-labeled PtdInsP2 product was PtdIns-3,4-P2 was obtained by incubation of the product with purified recombinant inositol polyphosphate 4-ptase produced in Sf9 cells and separation of the subsequent products by TLC (29Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of [3H]Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 by immunoprecipitates was measured as above in 25 μl containing 16 μM [3H]Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 (6000 cpm/nmol) under conditions where the reaction was linear with time (20 min, 37°C) and enzyme amount (30Mitchell C.A. Connolly T.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Blood. 1993; 81: 3204-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that PtdIns-4,5-P2 rather than PtdIns plus PtdIns-4,5-P2 was used as the substrate. Recently, we cloned the inositol polyphosphate 5-ptase, SHIP, from a hemopoietic, IL-3-dependent murine cell line, B6SUtA1 (20Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Of the 5-ptases cloned to date (31Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 32Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), SHIP was unique in that it possessed an SH2 domain, became phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and associated with Shc following IL-3 stimulation (20Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These properties suggested that it might play an important role in cytokine-mediated signaling. To determine at what site(s) within the cell that SHIP exerted its effects, we reasoned that since Shc associates with many cell surface receptors following growth factor stimulation (21Obermeier A.

Blood. 1993; 82: 2296-2303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it might bring SHIP to the IL-3R. To test this, B6SUtA1 cells treated with and without IL-3 were lysed, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P-specific 5-ptase assays were carried out with anti-Shc and anti-IL-3R immunoprecipitates. As can be seen in Fig. 1, normal rabbit serum immunoprecipitates did not contain any 5-ptase activity while anti-Shc immunoprecipitates did, but, as shown previously (20Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), only after IL-3 stimulation. Anti-IL-3R immunoprecipitates, on the other hand, possessed 5-ptase activity constitutively, and the level of this activity did not change with IL-3 stimulation. These results suggested a number of possibilities. A small amount of Shc could be associating with the IL-3R constitutively and in this context be capable of binding SHIP. Alternatively, SHIP could be binding independent of Shc to the IL-3R or a 5-ptase distinct from SHIP could be binding to the IL-3R. To test the first possibility, B6SUtA1 cells treated with and without IL-3 were lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Shc or anti-IL-3R antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western analysis with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies (4G10). As can be seen in Fig. 2A, anti-Shc antibodies co-precipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of the 145-kDa SHIP protein following IL-3 stimulation, in keeping with our previous results (20Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 34Liu L. Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It was difficult to determine, however, whether anti-IL-3R antibodies co-precipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of SHIP because of the presence of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 140-kDa IL-3R β subunit (34Liu L. Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, reprobing this blot with anti-Shc antibodies revealed that Shc associated with the IL-3R only following IL-3 stimulation. This suggested that the first possibility was unlikely. To discriminate between the last two possibilites, i.e. whether SHIP or a different 5-ptase was associated with the IL-3R, we took advantage of our previous finding that SHIP also hydrolyzed the 5-position phosphate from Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 (20Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and asked if the IL-3R-associated 5-ptase shared this property. As shown in Fig. 2B, it did not. Thus, a 5-ptase distinct from SHIP associated with the IL-3R. Moreover, the fact that IL-3 did not increase the level of Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 (or PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) hydrolyzing activity in IL-3R immunoprecipitates indicated that the Shc associating with the IL-3R in response to IL-3 either does not have SHIP attached or, more likely, is present in too low amounts to detect its associated SHIP under the assay conditions used. Consistent with this result, we could not detect SHIP in anti-SHIP immunoblots of anti-IL-3R immunoprecipitates (data not shown). At this point in our studies, Jackson et al. (35Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Matzaris M. Brown S. Mitchell C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported the partial purification of a novel 5-ptase that removed the 5-position phosphate from PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 but not from Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 and that associated with PI 3-kinase in human platelets. As a first test to determine if a similar PI 3-kinase-associated 5-ptase might be responsible for the IL-3R-associated 5-ptase activity observed in B6SUtA1 cells, we investigated whether PI 3-kinase was constitutively associated with the IL-3R by carrying out Western analysis, using antibodies to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, with anti-p85 and anti-IL-3R immunoprecipitates from B6SUtA1 cells. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, both the α and β isoforms of p85 were constitutively associated with the IL-3R in these cells. Since this was somewhat of a surprise, given that we and others have observed PI 3-kinase binding to other growth factor receptors only after growth factor stimulation (33Damen J.E. Mui A.L.-F. Puil L. Pawson T. Krystal G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3204-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Jiao H. Yi T. Krystal G. J. Biol.

Williams L.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we sought to confirm this with PI 3-kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, anti-IL-3R immunoprecipitates clearly possessed PI 3-kinase activity in the absence of IL-3 stimulation, although this activity increased following addition of IL-3. This increase was consistent with previous reports showing that IL-3 increases total cellular PI 3-kinase activity in hemopoietic cell lines (41Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then tested whether PI 3-kinase actually possessed an associated 5-ptase activity in our murine myeloid cell line by determining whether anti-p85 immunoprecipitates were capable of hydrolyzing PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. As can be seen in Fig. 3C, this was indeed the case and 5-ptase activity did not change with IL-3 stimulation, consistent with it being the IL-3R-associated 5-ptase. Moreover, the 5-ptase activity associated with the anti-p85 immunoprecipitates was substantially higher, on a per cell basis, than that associated with the IL-3R (Fig. 3C). This too was consistent with the possibility that the IL-3R-associated 5-ptase was binding indirectly to the receptor via PI 3-kinase since only a minor proportion of the total cellular PI 3-kinase is associated with the IL-3R (i.e. Fig. 3A). To confirm that the ptases associated with the IL-3R and p85 were indeed 5-ptases and not 4-ptases, PtdIns-3,4,5-[32P]P3 5-ptase assays were carried with anti-p85, anti-IL-3R, and anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates from B6SUtA1 cells treated with IL-3, as usual, and the 32P-labeled PtdInsP2 product was incubated with or without purified inositol polyphosphate 4-ptase before separation by TLC (29Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3D, 4-ptase treatment of all three immunoprecipitates resulted in the appearance of a new 32P-labeled spot that comigrated with PtdInsP. Since the initial PtdInsP3 substrate was labeled in the 3-position, this confirmed that the IL-3R- and p85-associated enzyme was indeed a 5-ptase. As a further test to see if the PI 3-kinase-associated 5-ptase was identical to the IL-3R-associated 5-ptase, substrate specificity comparisons were undertaken, and, as is shown in Table I, both 5-ptases only recognized PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 as a substrate and both required Mg2+ as a cofactor. This last property distinguishes this 5-ptase from that reported in human platelets (35Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Matzaris M. Brown S. Mitchell C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and, taken together with its substrate specificity, suggests that the 5-ptase associated with PI 3-kinase is identical to that associated with the IL-3R, that it associates with the IL-3R via its constitutive interaction with PI 3-kinase, and that it is distinct from other 5-ptases reported to date.Table IThe IL-3R- and p85-associated 5-ptases have identical substrate specificitiesSubstrateAnti-IL-3R IPAnti-p85 IPPtdIns-3,4,5-P3++PtdIns-4,5-P2−−Ins-1,3,4,5-P4−−Ins-1,4,5-P3−−PtdIns-3,4,5-P3+ 3 mM EDTA−− Open table in a new tab The identification of receptor-associated proteins is an essential first step in elucidating downstream signals initiated by the binding of growth factors to their receptors. In the case of IL-3, our current results, coupled with previous data, suggest that Jak2, PI 3-kinase, a 110-kDa serine/threonine kinase, and a novel 5-ptase associate constitutively with the IL-3R while Shc and hematopoietic cell phosphatase bind only following IL-3 stimulation. Although our finding that PI 3-kinase associates constitutively with the IL-3R was somewhat of a surprise, it is consistent with a recent report by Rao and Mufson (42Rao P. Mufson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6886-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in which they demonstrated that a GST fusion protein containing only the membrane proximal 67 amino acids of the IL-3R βc subunit cytoplasmic domain, and that was not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated, was capable of binding PI 3-kinase in vitro (42Rao P. Mufson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6886-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As to exactly how PI 3-kinase is binding to the IL-3R (which does not contain a consensus sequence for the SH2 domains of p85 on either its IL-3R α or β subunits), Jucker and Feldman (43Zucker M. Feldman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27817-27822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) recently reported that a 76-85-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein may link PI 3-kinase to the IL-3R β subunit in human TF-1 cells. This is of interest given that we recently identified a 72-kDa protein that was both constitutively associated with the IL-3R and constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in B6SUtA1 cells (19Liu L. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22422-22427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Our current results also suggest that the binding of 5-ptase to the IL-3R may be indirect, via PI 3-kinase. Although further studies will be required to confirm this, the finding that a novel 5-ptase binds to both PI 3-kinase and the IL-3R in B6SUtA1 cells is very intriguing given the growing evidence that PI 3-kinase plays a crucial role in mediating many growth factor-stimulated events, including mitogenesis, receptor internalization, membrane ruffling, and glucose transport (reviewed in Refs. 44Panayotou G.

Most if not all of these events are likely mediated by its major phospholipid product, PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (46Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F.

The specific 5-ptase we have identified appears to be constitutively associated with PI 3-kinase (i.e. its activity does not change in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates with IL-3 stimulation), and, since the major in vivo product of PI 3-kinase is the substrate for this 5-ptase, it is likely that one of its functions is to maintain low levels of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 in unstimulated cells. Following IL-3 stimulation, when PI 3-kinase activity is increased, its function may be to return PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 levels back to resting levels after the various PI 3-kinase-activated cascades have been triggered and/or to generate sufficient PtdIns-3,4-P2 to activate similar or as yet uncharacterized pathways.

Both of these features are critical for its ability to form the higher order recombinogenic complexes responsible for site-specific recombination between viral DNA and the genome of its host, Escherichia coli (for reviews, see Refs. 1Landy A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 913-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Craig N.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 77-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). DNA substrates for the Int-mediated reaction are specific viral (attP) and bacterial (attB) DNA sequences. The reaction products comprise the left (attL) and right (attR) junctions between viral and bacterial DNA. These prophage junctions themselves are substrates for an Int-mediated excisive recombination that regenerates the attP and attB DNA sequences. attP DNA comprises 240 base pairs and contains many protein binding sites for Int and accessory proteins (IHF, Xis, and Fis). These DNA-bending proteins cooperate with Int to form the recombinogenic “intasomes” (3Better M. Lu C. Williams R.C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). attB contains only two Int binding sites of the core-type while attL and attR are hybrid sites of intermediate complexity between attP and attB.There are two classes of binding sites for Int. Core-type sites are positioned as inverted repeats that encompass each of the sites of DNA strand nicking, which are staggered by 7 base pairs called the overlap region on each DNA helix (4Ross W. Landy A. Cell. 1983; 33: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Mizuuchi K. Weisberg R. Enquist L. Mizuuchi M. Buraczynska M. Foeller C. Hsu P. Ross W. Landy A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1981; 45: 429-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arm-type Int binding sites have a different consensus recognition sequence, located some distance away from the region of strand exchange, and they bind Int with a higher affinity than the core-type sites (6Ross W. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7724-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).When Int was first purified, it was shown to be a type I topoisomerase that could nick and religate DNA in the absence of any high energy cofactors (7Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7149-7157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). While this activity fit nicely with the requirements for a recombination that cleaved and reassorted DNA helices, its function was clearly more complex than that of a simple topoisomerase. One of the first suggestions of this complexity came from the effects of pretreating Int with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). While NEM treatment abolished recombination activity, it did not impair the topoisomerase activity of Int (8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was observed that NEM abolished the formation of non-filterable heparin-resistant complexes that Int formed with attP DNA (7Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7149-7157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led Kikuchi and Nash (8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to speculate that Int had two domains. Nuclease protection experiments showed that NEM inactivated one of two distinct DNA binding specificities, namely the one responsible for heparin-resistant binding at the high affinity arm-type sites (6Ross W. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7724-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Binding at the low affinity heparin-sensitive core-type sites, where strand cleavage takes place, was (like the topoisomerase activity) resistant to NEM modification.Although the analysis of partial proteolytic fragments has been used to localize the two DNA binding specificities to an amino-terminal and a carboxyl-terminal domain, respectively, the specific activity of the proteolytic fragments was significantly reduced relative to intact Int (9Moitoso de Vargas L. Pargellis C.A. Hasan N.M. Bushman E.W. Landy A. Cell. 1988; 54: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additionally, an extensive mutational mapping analysis of the functional domains of Int has revealed some mutants that affect binding to arm-type sites but map in the carboxyl-terminal domain (10Han Y.W. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify the unique cysteine residue that is modified by NEM and show by site-directed mutagenesis that loss of recombination function is due to the presence of the maleimide moiety and not due to loss of a critical cysteine contact.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe sulfhydryl group of cysteines is in general the most reactive functional group in a protein. N-Ethylmaleimide reacts with sulfhydryl groups in proteins with considerable specificity under conditions such as those used in the present study (18Gregory J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 3922-3923Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19Gorin G. Martic P.A. Doughty G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 115: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The reaction is very rapid and involves the addition of the SH group to the olefinic double bond of NEM to form a thioether (Fig. 1) (20Smyth D.G. Nagamatsu A. Fruton J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 4600-4604Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). There are instances where NEM has been shown to react with functional groups other than the SH group, namely, the α-amino group of peptides, the imidazole moiety of histidine (20Smyth D.G. Nagamatsu A. Fruton J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 4600-4604Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21Smyth D.G. Blumenfeld O.O. Konigsberg W. Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and the ϵ-amino group of lysine (22Brewer C.F. Riehm J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 18: 248-255Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, all of these non-SH side chain reactions are much slower than the reaction of NEM with the sulfhydryl moiety of cysteine. Under conditions where the reaction with thiol groups is complete within 20 s, the non-SH reactions have half-times of about 2 h (23Schnetger J. Reactions of NEM with peptides and proteins.Doctoral dissertation. University of Frankfurt, Germany1966Google Scholar). It should also be emphasized that these non-SH reactions occur efficiently only at very high concentrations of NEM (100 mM), well above those used in SH group modifications (1-5 mM) (22Brewer C.F. Riehm J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 18: 248-255Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar).There are four Cys residues in the bacteriophage λ-Int protein. One Cys residue is present in the amino-terminal domain, which recognizes and binds to “arm-type” DNA, while the other three are located in the carboxyl-terminal domain, which binds to “core-type” DNA and also harbors the “nicking-ligating” topoisomerase activity (8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As observed previously (8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), modification of the Int protein with 2.5 mM N-ethylmaleimide for 15 min results in 95% inactivation of recombination activity and no reduction in the topoisomerase activity (Fig. 2). The stoichiometry of incorporation of [3H]NEM into the Int protein showed that at the concentration of NEM required for 95% inactivation of recombination activity, 1 eq of [3H]NEM was incorporated per equivalent of the Int protein (Fig. 2), suggesting the modification of a single Cys residue.Fig. 2Effect of NEM modification of the bacteriophage λ-Int protein on the recombination and topoisomerase activities of λ-Int. Bacteriophage λ-Int protein was modified with different concentrations of [3H]NEM as described under “Materials and Methods.” Three aliquots of the modified enzyme were assayed, respectively, for recombination activity (•), for topoisomerase activity (∘), and for the amount of [3H]NEM incorporated per equivalent of the protein (♦) as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the target Cys residue, the Int protein was modified with [14C]NEM. The [14C]NEM-Int adduct was fragmented by treatment with 70% formic acid, which cleaves the protein at Asp-Pro bonds (24Piszkiewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The relatively low abundance of aspartic acid-proline linkages and the ease with which the reaction can be carried out make it an attractive method for generating large fragments for direct sequence analysis or for subsequent proteolytic digestion. There are two Asp-Pro linkages in the Int protein; one is in the amino terminus at position 28-29 of the primary amino acid sequence while the other is at position 303-304 (Fig. 3). Thus, formic acid cleavage of the Int protein should result in three fragments of sizes 27, 5, and 3 kDa, respectively.Fig. 3Amino acid sequence of bacteriophage λ-Int. The four Cys residues (asterisk) and the two formic acid-sensitive Asp-Pro linkages (down arrows) are shown (25Hoess R.H. Foeller C. Bidwell K. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2482-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the residues identified in amino-terminal sequencing of the 3-kDa peptide are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The formic acid digestion products were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Fractogel HW-50 (F) column, and individual fractions were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining for total protein or by fluorography for detection of 14C radioactivity (Fig. 4). The first peak of highest molecular weight material is expected to contain the 27-kDa peptide extending from position 30 to 303, two large (partial digest) peptides generated by formic acid cleavage at only one of the two Asp-Pro sites, as well as some large peptides due to formic acid cleavage at bonds of intermediate acid lability and uncleaved Int. This heterogeneous collection of peptides is seen near the top of the Coomassie-stained gel (fractions 17-21, middle panel). The most prominent band is the 27-kDa peptide; above it a trail of larger peptides extends to the undigested Int that has been trapped in the well. The radioactivity in these fractions did not migrate as a discrete band. Except for the undigested material trapped in the well, the radioactivity in this region is present as a dispersed low level smear (fractions 18-20, bottom panel). The plot of UV absorbance shows that, appended to the first peak, there is a shoulder of a lower molecular weight peptide that should correspond to the 5-kDa peptide extending from position 304 to the carboxyl terminus (fractions 22-23, middle panel). Comparison of the Coomassie-stained gel and the autoradiograph shows that there is no radioactivity associated with this peptide. The next peak, fractions 25-28 (middle panel), contains the 3-kDa peptide that extends from the amino terminus to position 29. This is the only peak that contains a specific band of radioactivity (bottom panel). The last peak in the UV plot contains heterogeneous degradation products of <1 kDa and has no radioactivity associated with it.Fig. 4Formic acid treatment and fractionation of [14C]NEM-modified Int. Bacteriophage λ-Int protein was modified with [14C]NEM as described and subjected to treatment with 70% formic acid as described under “Materials and Methods.” The resultant partial acid hydrolysate was fractionated on a Fractogel HW-50 (F) sizing column in 12% acetic acid. The top panel shows the elution profiles of total protein, absorbance at 280 nm (solid line), and 14C radioactivity in disintegrations/minute (dashed line). Individual fractions were resolved on a 12.5% urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was visualized either by staining with Coomassie Blue (middle panel) or by fluorography (bottom panel) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The lane marked L contains an aliquot of the unfractionated formic acid digest prior to loading on the column. The molecular weight markers (M) are the cyanogen bromide-cleaved products of apomyoglobin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The specific activity of the fractions containing the 3-kDa peptide (fractions 26-28, bottom panel) is more than 6 times higher than any other fraction from the column. Additionally, the fraction of radioactivity recovered in the 3-kDa peak from the column (37%) is the same as the fraction of radioactivity recovered in the analogous band (39%) from the crude unfractionated hydrolysate (lane L, bottom panel). These observations, coupled with the overall high yield of radioactivity following the column fractionation (88% recovery), reinforce the conclusion that the primary site of [14C]NEM modification is in the smallest formic acid peptide. We confirmed that the 3-kDa peptide does indeed correspond to the amino-terminal fragment (amino acid residues 1-28) by subjecting it to 10 cycles of amino-terminal amino acid sequencing (Fig. 3). As stated above, this fragment has a unique Cys residue at position 25.To confirm that Cys-25 is the target of NEM reactivity and to rule out the unlikely possibility that the NEM reactivity was targeted to a non-SH group (see above), we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to change this residue to a serine (C25S) or an alanine (C25A). The mutations were introduced by standard oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis techniques, confirmed by sequencing, and introduced into appropriate plasmid vectors for protein production (under “Materials and Methods”). Wild-type Int and the mutant proteins were purified to at least 85% purity as judged by Coomassie blue staining of a polyacrylamide gel. That Cys-25 in the wild-type Int protein is the target of NEM-reactivity was clearly evident from the observation that the mutant protein C25S is completely resistant to NEM modification (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Comparison of NEM modification of the wild-type λ-Int protein and its mutant C25S. Wild-type (wt) λ-Int protein and its mutant C25S (one nmol of each protein) were treated with 2.5 mM [14C]NEM. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed and assayed for incorporation of [14C]NEM into protein as described under “Materials and Methods.” Incorporated radioactivity is shown as equivalents/mol of protein (mol NEM incorporated per mol of protein).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The mutants also made it possible to determine whether the functional sensitivity of Int to NEM modification reflected a critical role for the SH group of Cys-25. Fig. 6 shows that both C25S and C25A are indistinguishable from wild-type Int in their ability to catalyze recombination in vitro. We conclude that the SH group of Cys-25 does not provide any critical contacts, either with arm-type DNA or with other parts of the Int protein, to form the arm-type recognition pocket. The loss of arm-type DNA binding and the concomitant loss of recombination function as a result of NEM modification must be due to the presence of the maleimide moiety and not due to loss of a critical cysteine contact.Fig. 6Comparison of the recombination activities of the wild-type λ-Int protein and its mutants, C25A and C25S, and their respective sensitivities to NEM-modification. Equal amounts of wild-type Int and the C25A and C25S mutants were assayed for recombination activity before (•) and after (♦) treatment with 2.5 mM NEM as described under “Materials and Methods.”32P-Labeled attB was recombined with unlabeled supercoiled attP, and the reaction was resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. The fraction of radioactivity converted to recombinant product was quantitated by phosphoimager analysis of the gels (under “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The initial observation of NEM sensitivity was one of the original bases for suggesting a two-domain structure for Int (8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Subsequent partial proteolysis provided more substantial evidence, but there are caveats associated with the results of partial proteolysis (9Moitoso de Vargas L. Pargellis C.A. Hasan N.M. Bushman E.W. Landy A. Cell. 1988; 54: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The results reported here with the intact protein map the arm-binding defect of NEM-Int to the amino-terminal domain. This further strengthens the argument for, and identification of, two domains with distinct and non-overlapping interactions with DNA. One of these is an NEM-sensitive amino-terminal domain that binds with high affinity to arm-type DNA recognition sequence. The other is an NEM-insensitive carboxyl-terminal domain that binds with low affinity to core-type DNA recognition sequence and specifies the nicking and ligating activities of Int. Although the two domains appear to be relatively independent, mutational analyses indicate that there may be some interaction between them (10Han Y.W. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The disruption of arm binding by the maleimide moiety could be due to simple steric hindrance, i.e. the presence of a bulky group, or it could cause a conformational change in the vicinal arm-type DNA binding pocket. The change in conformation, if any, is probably confined to a specific and localized region since recognition/binding to core-type DNA or its topoisomerase activity are unaffected (6Ross W. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7724-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As more structural information about Int is acquired, modeling the structural basis for the maleimide inhibition should be helpful in evaluating potential environments for Cys-25 and for working out the structural details of how this unusual heterobivalent DNA-binding protein interacts with DNA to form a higher order recombinogenic complex.

These prophage junctions themselves are substrates for an Int-mediated excisive recombination that regenerates the attP and attB DNA sequences. attP DNA comprises 240 base pairs and contains many protein binding sites for Int and accessory proteins (IHF, Xis, and Fis). These DNA-bending proteins cooperate with Int to form the recombinogenic “intasomes” (3Better M. Lu C. Williams R.C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). attB contains only two Int binding sites of the core-type while attL and attR are hybrid sites of intermediate complexity between attP and attB.There are two classes of binding sites for Int. Core-type sites are positioned as inverted repeats that encompass each of the sites of DNA strand nicking, which are staggered by 7 base pairs called the overlap region on each DNA helix (4Ross W. Landy A. Cell. 1983; 33: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Mizuuchi K. Weisberg R. Enquist L. Mizuuchi M. Buraczynska M. Foeller C. Hsu P. Ross W. Landy A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1981; 45: 429-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arm-type Int binding sites have a different consensus recognition sequence, located some distance away from the region of strand exchange, and they bind Int with a higher affinity than the core-type sites (6Ross W. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7724-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).When Int was first purified, it was shown to be a type I topoisomerase that could nick and religate DNA in the absence of any high energy cofactors (7Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7149-7157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). While this activity fit nicely with the requirements for a recombination that cleaved and reassorted DNA helices, its function was clearly more complex than that of a simple topoisomerase. One of the first suggestions of this complexity came from the effects of pretreating Int with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). While NEM treatment abolished recombination activity, it did not impair the topoisomerase activity of Int (8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was observed that NEM abolished the formation of non-filterable heparin-resistant complexes that Int formed with attP DNA (7Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7149-7157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led Kikuchi and Nash (8Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to speculate that Int had two domains. Nuclease protection experiments showed that NEM inactivated one of two distinct DNA binding specificities, namely the one responsible for heparin-resistant binding at the high affinity arm-type sites (6Ross W. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7724-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Binding at the low affinity heparin-sensitive core-type sites, where strand cleavage takes place, was (like the topoisomerase activity) resistant to NEM modification.Although the analysis of partial proteolytic fragments has been used to localize the two DNA binding specificities to an amino-terminal and a carboxyl-terminal domain, respectively, the specific activity of the proteolytic fragments was significantly reduced relative to intact Int (9Moitoso de Vargas L. Pargellis C.A. Hasan N.M. Bushman E.W. Landy A. Cell. 1988; 54: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additionally, an extensive mutational mapping analysis of the functional domains of Int has revealed some mutants that affect binding to arm-type sites but map in the carboxyl-terminal domain (10Han Y.W. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify the unique cysteine residue that is modified by NEM and show by site-directed mutagenesis that loss of recombination function is due to the presence of the maleimide moiety and not due to loss of a critical cysteine contact.

Both of these features are critical for its ability to form the higher order recombinogenic complexes responsible for site-specific recombination between viral DNA and the genome of its host, Escherichia coli (for reviews, see Refs. 1Landy A.

Among the regulatory sequences that differ between the loci is the interferon-responsive element (IRE). While the B-IRE is conserved, the A-IREs have species-specific sequence variation. We previously demonstrated that the B-IRE was an interferon (IFN)-inducible enhancer, whereas none of the A-IREs were functional. In the present study, we examined the biochemical basis for the enhancer activity of the conserved B-IRE and found that this may be attributed to a novel γ-IFN-inducible factor. This factor accumulated in nuclei of cells within minutes of exposure to γ-IFN. Its appearance was independent of de novo protein synthesis. However, it was not detected in nuclei of cells treated with herbimycin A, suggesting that its appearance depends on a protein kinase activation pathway. Supershift assays indicated that it was distinct from STAT1α, IFN regulatory factor-1, and p48, transcription factors known to bind IRE-like sequences found in regulatory regions of many non-major histocompatibility complex γ-IFN-responsive genes. Competition assays show that this novel factor bound B-IRE with relatively high affinity, about 100-fold more than that for the A-IRE sequence. This factor was also present in STAT1α and p48 somatic mutants that also exhibited B-IRE enhancer activity in reporter gene bioassays in a manner similar to those seen with wild type cells.

Additionally, the loss and/or the aberrant expression of the class I MHC glycoproteins have been implicated in various forms of immune dysfunction. For instance, the loss of expression of class I molecules in mice has been associated with marked susceptibility to infections due to the lack of CD8+ T cells (16Zijlstra M. Bix M. Simister N.E.

Similarly, infection with certain viruses may result in the generalized loss, locus-specific loss, or locus-specific up-regulation of class I glycoproteins (25Maudsley D.J. Pound J.D. Immunol.

In humans, the expression of class I HLA-A and -B glycoproteins is not tightly coordinated (5David-Wattine B. Israel A. Kourilsky P. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 286-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that immature cortical thymocytes express very low levels of HLA-B (32Gambon F. Kreisler M. Diaz-Espada F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the in vitro treatment of isolated cortical thymocytes and thymocyte-derived cell lines with type I or type II interferon (IFN) results in the preferential up-regulation of HLA-B (32Gambon F. Kreisler M. Diaz-Espada F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Girdlestone J. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This preferential induction of HLA-B by IFN has been reported to occur in other cell types as well (34Hakem R. Le Bouteiller P. Jezo-Bremond A. Harper K. Campese D. Lemmonier F.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2384-2390PubMed Google Scholar, 35Girdlestone J. Isamat M. Gewert D. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11568-11572Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, HLA-A has been shown to be more responsive to inducers, like tumor necrosis factor α, that are potent activators of the Rel family of transcription factors (35Girdlestone J. Isamat M. Gewert D. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11568-11572Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Mansky P. Brown W.M. Park J.H. Choi J.W. Yan S.Y. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5082-5090PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the observed differences in the basal and inducible expression of the human HLA-A and -B genes, results of the analyses of the 5′ proximal regulatory regions of the A and B homologues in the higher primates reveal strong locus-specific properties of the two gene loci (37Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3912-3921PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of 25 million years of evolution, the A-locus promoters have accumulated significant structural changes, whereas the B-locus promoters are generally more conserved. Interestingly, these accumulating changes in the A-promoters during phylogeny are correlated with fewer transcription factor binding motifs. These observations provide a phylogenetic basis for the differential regulation of expression of class I MHC genes. Among the A-locus regulatory elements that have changed over time is the interferon-responsive element (IRE), a member of a family of enhancers that determines induction of many genes by IFNs (38Friedman R.L. Stark G.R. Nature. 1985; 314: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 39Reid L.E. Brasnett A.H. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C. Gewert D.R. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Singer D.S. Maguire J.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 235-257PubMed Google Scholar). In reporter gene bioassays, none of the A-IRE variants are functional, whereas the conserved B-IRE is a strong IFN-inducible enhancer (41Vallejo A.N. Allen K.S. Pease L.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A single mutation, common among the primate A-IREs, is sufficient to inactivate the enhancer element. Additional mutations specific to different primate branches did not rescue enhancer activity. It is important to note that the conserved B-IRE motif in the higher primates is the identical sequence found among the classical class I MHC genes of phylogenetically lower mammals and that these orthologous genes are also responsive to γ-IFN (40Singer D.S. Maguire J.E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 235-257PubMed Google Scholar, 42Marche P.N. Tykocinski M.E. Max E.E. Kindt T.J. Immunogenetics. 1985; 21: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 43Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 143: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This suggests a common γ-IFN-inducible regulatory machinery for the mammalian class I MHC genes. Thus, the present study was carried out to examine the biochemical basis for the differential enhancer activity between the MHC A- and B-IRE in response to γ-IFN. Inasmuch as the pathways for the activation of non-MHC IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) have already been established (44Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar), experiments were performed to determine whether or not the IFN-inducible enhancer activity of the conserved primate class I MHC B-locus IRE may be attributed to similar or unique transcription factors. Although the up-regulation of many MHC class I genes by IFN is well documented (34Hakem R. Le Bouteiller P. Jezo-Bremond A. Harper K. Campese D. Lemmonier F.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2384-2390PubMed Google Scholar, 35Girdlestone J. Isamat M. Gewert D. Milstein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1990; 10: 235-257PubMed Google Scholar), the biochemical basis for this observation remains to be elucidated. Here, evidence is presented for a novel γ-IFN-inducible factor that correlates with the strong enhancer activity of the MHC class I B-locus IRE. HeLa and K562 cells were maintained in suspension cultures as described previously (41Vallejo A.N. Allen K.S. Pease L.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The fibroblast cell lines 2FGTH, U2A(Δp48), and U3A (ΔSTAT1α) were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 60 μg/ml penicillin, 135 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 80 μg/ml gentamycin, 300 μg/ml L-glutamine, 10−5M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). These cell lines were provided by Dr. George Stark (Cleveland Clinic Research Institute). Cell surface expression of class I HLA molecules in the three fibroblast cell lines was determined as described previously (41Vallejo A.N. Allen K.S. Pease L.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with trypsin-EDTA for 1 min, and washed in complete medium. Aliquots of 2 × 107 cells were resuspended in complete medium and incubated for 18 h at 37°C with or without γ-IFN (BioSource, Camarillo, CA) and/or βIFN (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations. Class I HLA expression was determined by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) W6/32 (ATCC, Bethesda, MD). Transient transfections of luciferase reporter plasmids and the normalizing β-galactosidase reporter were carried out as described previously (41Vallejo A.N. Allen K.S. Pease L.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated at 37°C in the presence or absence of 1000 units/ml γ-IFN, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured after 18 h. Enzyme activities were assayed by chemiluminescence using a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WS) and a β-galactosidase kit (Galactolight, Tropix, Bedford, MA). Light emissions were measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold Analytical, Nashua, NH). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a high salt extraction protocol described previously (45Brunn G.J. Falls E.L. Nilson A.E. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11628-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were incubated in complete medium containing 1000 units/ml γ-IFN for the indicated periods. Cells were then washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a HEPES hypotonic buffer. Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation and washed twice in 500 μl of wash buffer. Nuclear proteins were extracted in 75 μl of extraction buffer and cleared of nuclear debris by centrifugation, and the concentration of extracted proteins was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Samples were kept on ice during the entire procedure with the exception of the latter extraction steps that were done at 4°C. All centrifugation steps were also carried out at 4°C using a tabletop microcentrifuge. Nuclear extracts were aliquoted into smaller quantities, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. To examine the role of protein synthesis on the activation of γ-IFN-inducible factors, nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells exposed to γ-IFN in the presence of cycloheximide. Cells were pretreated with 5 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) in serum-free media for 30 min, washed, and resuspended in the same medium containing 1000 units/ml γ-IFN. Fresh aliquots of cycloheximide at varying concentrations were also added and then cells were incubated for an additional 30-45 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. The role of protein kinases in the activation of γ-IFN-inducible transcription factors was also examined. This was carried out in experiments using a kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A (45Brunn G.J. Falls E.L. Nilson A.E. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11628-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were initially incubated in serum-free media containing a non-cytotoxic dose of 50 μM herbimycin A (LC Labs, Woburn, MA) or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide, the drug carrier, for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were washed, resuspended in the same culture medium containing the drug and 1000 units/ml γ-IFN, and incubated at 37°C for the indicated period. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (45Brunn G.J. Falls E.L. Nilson A.E. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11628-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). About 20 μg of nuclear extract was combined with 15 μl of binding buffer, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), and 3 μg of nonspecific oligonucleotide (Table I). The total volume of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 25 μl with the wash buffer and left on ice for 30 min. The radiolabeled specific double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (see below) was added to the reaction and incubated at room temperature for an additional 30 min. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. The relative intensities of the shifted bands were determined by optical imaging of multiple autoradiograms using the AMBIS 4000 System (Ambis Inc., San Diego, CA). The NFκB probe (CGGGATCCTGGGGATTCCCCA) was used in initial experiments to demonstrate the IRE specificity of the γ-IFN-inducible binding activity described here (see text).

Oligonucleotide probes used in this study are listed in Table I. Their binding specificity for known transcription factors are as indicated. With the exception of the nonspecific oligomer, the complementary strands of all oligonucleotides were synthesized (DNA synthesizer Model 301A, Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA) and purified as described previously (48Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.P. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S123-S130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of both strands of the oligomers were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) by the standard end-labeling reaction; the unincorporated radiolabel was removed by centrifugal column chromatography (QuickSpin, Boehringer Mannheim); and the eluates of the respective oligomer pairs were combined and annealed. The annealed probes were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, lyophilized, and resuspended in sterile water to a final concentration of 40 fmol/μl. Probes were stored at −20°C and used within 7 days. Reporter gene bioassays have previously demonstrated that none of the MHC A-locus IRE variants were functional, whereas the conserved B-IRE exhibited IFN-inducible enhancer activity (41Vallejo A.N. Allen K.S. Pease L.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) comparable with a known γ-IFN-inducible enhancer, SIE (45Brunn G.J. Falls E.L. Nilson A.E. Abraham R.T.

By virtue of the design of reporter gene constructs in which the 12-nucleotide core B-IRE sequence flanked by MHC A-locus sequences, the enhancer activity of the element was attributed to a single nucleotide in the middle of the sequence, i.e. an A → T change between the B-IRE and the A-IREs. In order to determine what transcription factor(s) may be responsible for this enhancer activity, similar IRE oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and used in gel shift experiments. As shown in Table I, the MHC IRE probes were 17-mers that differed from each other by one or two nucleotides. Using nuclear extracts from K562 and HeLa cells, gel shift assays revealed the appearance of a B-IRE binding factor in the nuclei of cells within minutes of exposure to γ-IFN, i.e. between 10 to 45 min (Fig. 1, A and B). The appearance of this B-IRE binding gamma-IFN-activated factor, herein referred to as BIGAF, is fairly transient in that the observed protein binding activities of B-IRE dropped to base-line levels after 1-2 h of exposure to γ-IFN. The levels of induction of BIGAF varied considerably between extracts ranging from 5.6- to 171-fold in excess of the detectable base-line binding activity (Table II). The reason for this variability is not known, although it may be attributed to differences in endogenous BIGAF activity of untreated cells possibly caused by"
https://openalex.org/W1994377404,"<i>Escherichia coli</i> aspartate transcarbamoylase regulates pyrimidine biosynthesis by altering its activity homotropically in response to one of its substrates and heterotropically in response to nucleotide effectors. The mechanism of this regulation involves two structurally and functionally different forms of the enzyme, one with low activity and low affinity for substrates (T state) and the other with high activity and high affinity for substrates (R state). Heterotropic regulation may be due to the direct transmission of a regulatory ""signal"" between the regulatory site and the active site some 60 Å away and/or may involve altering the relative stability of the two forms of the enzyme. By combining a T state-stabilized mutant version of the enzyme, previously thought to have a defect in a heterotropic transmission pathway, with a known R state-stabilized mutant enzyme, we were able to restore some properties of the wild-type enzyme. These data imply that the relative stabilization of the T and R states of the enzyme is in part responsible for the homotropic and heterotropic properties of aspartate transcarbamoylase and that direct pathways for transmission of the heterotropic signals are unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W1985430730,"The pH dependence of CO binding kinetics to Chelidonichthys kumu hemoglobin (Hb) and human adult Hb has been investigated between pH 2.0 and 9.0 at 20°C. For both Hbs, CO binding kinetics is characterized by two proton-linked transitions, with different pKa values for α- and β-chains in C. kumu Hb, leading to a relevant functional kinetic heterogeneity at most pH values. On the other hand, in human adult Hb the CO binding does not display a functional heterogeneity. Lowering the pH from 9 to 6 brings about a decrease of the CO binding rate constants, to a different extent for human adult Hb and the two chains of C. kumu Hb. Further lowering the pH from 6 to 2 induces an enhancement of CO binding rate constants, probably related to the protonation of proximal HisF8 Nϵ atom and the cleavage (or severe weakening) of the HisF8-Fe bond. The presence of physiological concentrations of ATP (≈3 mM) affects the pH dependence of CO binding kinetics to C. kumu. Moreover, the effect of temperature (between 8°C and 38°C) on CO binding kinetics has been investigated in the absence of ATP at different pH values.

These results allow to interpret the functional kinetic heterogeneity of C. kumu Hb on the basis of different regulatory aspects in the α- and β-subunits, as suggested by structural considerations. In mammalian hemoglobins (Hb), the subunit structural heterogeneity of α- and β-chains usually does not bring about any relevant functional heterogeneity, this being especially true for CO binding both in the T and R quaternary states (1Sawicki C.A. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1533-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A different behavior has been observed for O2 binding to human adult Hb, which displays some kinetic heterogeneity (3Olson J.S. Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5919-5923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sawicki C.A. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7538-7547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Philo J.S.

Acta. 1993; 1162: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This finding clearly indicates that reactivity determinants indeed differ for various ligands and possibly for different quaternary conformations (7Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 327-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 8Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous investigations have shown that in the kinetic pathway of CO binding a crucial role is played by proximal HisF8, which modulates the ligand reactivity through the energy barrier for the movement of the ferrous iron to the heme plane (9Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Traylor T.G. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4151-4155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18286-18289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, even keeping a T-like quaternary conformation, the cleavage (or the severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond dramatically changes the reactivity of deoxy human adult Hb for CO at low pH, leading to an increase of the rate constant for ligand binding consistent with an R-like kinetic behavior (10Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18286-18289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no kinetic functional heterogeneity has been detected for human adult Hb, as indicated by the observation that alteration of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond may be described as an apparent single protonation process. Therefore, the proximal side of the heme pocket appears to display energy parameters closely similar for the two types of subunits in the T state of human adult Hb. On the other hand, a marked functional heterogeneity has been observed for CO binding to some fish Hbs (11Noble R.W. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 6628-6633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Giardina B. Giacometti G.M. Coletta M. Brunori M. Giacometti G. Rigatti G. Biochem.

Chem. 1978; 253: 3171-3179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it becomes especially evident whenever experimental conditions tend to stabilize the T quaternary state also in the liganded form. However, the structural basis for such a markedly heterogeneous behavior has not been established unequivocally (14Camardella L. Caruso C. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Rutigliano B. Tamburrini M. Fermi G. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 224: 449-460Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Ito N. Komiyama N.H. Fermi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The functional properties of fish Hb from Chelidonichthys kumu have been reported recently (16Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At neutral pH values, this Hb displays a markedly heterogeneous kinetic CO binding behavior, which parallels O2 equilibrium ligand binding properties typical of a Hb staying in the T quaternary state even in the liganded form (16Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In view of these features, and of the very stable tetrameric assembly observed in C. kumu Hb, like other fish Hbs (16Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Brunori M. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1975; 9: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the pH and temperature dependence of the dynamic behavior for CO binding to this fish Hb has been investigated and compared with the same process in human adult Hb. In this respect, C. kumu Hb offers a very interesting opportunity for studying the different proton-linked modulation of ligand reactivity in the two types of subunits within the tetramer. The main purpose of this approach is thus the characterization of some energy parameters, which play major roles in regulating the reactivity of this fish Hb, and, more in general, of the role of different subunits in modulating the dynamic pathway of ligand binding. This aspect has not been investigated for CO binding to mammalian Hbs, and in particular for human adult Hb, since only a fairly small (almost undetectable) kinetic functional heterogeneity has been observed in Fe-Co hybrids in the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate (18Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The comparison of the behavior observed in C. kumu Hb with respect to human adult Hb also allows one to envisage some detailed aspect(s) of potential effects of the heme environment on the regulation of the CO binding process, and thus on the origin of the functional heterogeneity in C. kumu Hb. Human adult Hb and C. kumu Hb were prepared as reported previously (16Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Antonini E. Brunori M. Tatum E.L. Neuberger A. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands.

Chemicals were from Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany) and Sigma. All products were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Kinetics of CO binding was carried out as previously reported at 419 nm and between 8°C and 38°C (9Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Traylor T.G. Brunori M. J. Biol.

CO binding kinetics was carried out in the absence and presence of 3 mM ATP (only for C. kumu Hb) between pH 2.0 and 9.0 (0.15 M phosphate buffer between pH 2.0 and 4.0 and between pH 5.5 and pH 7.5; 0.15 M acetate buffer between pH 4.0 and pH 5.5; 0.15 M MES 1The abbreviation used is: MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. buffer between pH 5.0 and 7.0; 0.15 M HEPES buffer between pH 6.5 and 8.0; 0.15 M Tris/HCl buffer between pH 7.5 and 9.0).

The transient spectrum of unliganded C. kumu Hb at pH 2.3 was obtained as described previously at 21°C (9Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Traylor T.G. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4151-4155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18286-18289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mixing deoxy Hb in a low ionic strength buffer at pH 7.0 with a degassed 0.15 M (final concentration) phosphate buffer at pH 2.0 (final pH = 2.3), and determining the amplitude of the denaturation process between 480 nm and 600 nm. Kinetic experiments were performed at the Department of Biochemical Sciences “Alessandro Rossi Fanelli” of the University of Roma “La Sapienza,” using a Gibson-Durrum stopped-flow apparatus with a 2-cm pathlength observation cell, connected to a desktop computer for fast data acquisition (On Line Systems, Jefferson, GA). The pH values of the reaction mixture were checked at every temperature. C. kumu Hb has been shown to bind O2 noncooperatively at neutral pH, cooperativity occurring at alkaline pH values; in parallel, kinetic heterogeneity for CO association and O2 dissociation fades out going from pH 6 to pH 9. Such behavior suggests that the lack of cooperativity may be at least partially attributed to the marked functional heterogeneity present in the T state, possibly accompanied by a stabilization of this low affinity quaternary conformation even in the liganded form. This feature likely contributes to impair the appearance of a cooperative ligand binding in C. kumu Hb. Furthermore, the physiological allosteric effector ATP has been shown to significantly decrease the ligand affinity of C. kumu Hb, impairing the appearance of cooperativity even at alkaline pH values. Such a finding indicates that ATP may play a significant role in modulating the ligand affinity, the quaternary conformational equilibrium, and possibly the functional heterogeneity of C. kumu Hb (16Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the pH dependence of CO binding bimolecular rate constants to human adult Hb (panel A) and to C. kumu Hb in the absence (panel B) and presence (panel C) of 3 mM ATP. The kinetic functional heterogeneity of C. kumu Hb is present essentially over the whole pH range, but it tends to disappear at pH 2.0 and 9.0. The pH dependence of the CO binding kinetic properties of adult human Hb refers to the overall rate constant, since no detectable kinetic heterogeneity is observed (10Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18286-18289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both adult human Hb and C. kumu Hb display a pH-dependent CO binding behavior, which requires two apparent protonation events, such that lowering pH from 9.0 to 6.0 brings about a decrease of the second-order rate constant followed by an enhancement of the kinetics upon further lowering of pH from 6.0 to 2.0 (Fig. 1). In all cases, the reverse bell-shaped pattern displays a well at pH values around 6, suggesting that the apparent singly protonated species is characterized by the slowest CO binding rate constant. Parameters reported in Table I have been obtained from the fitting of data according to the following equation. lobs′=l0′(1/P)+l1′K1H+/P+l2′K1K2H+2/P(Eq. 1) l′obs is the observed second-order rate constant for CO binding; l′0, l′1, and l′2 are the bimolecular rate constant for CO binding to the unprotonated, singly protonated, and doubly protonated molecule, respectively; K1 and K2 are the apparent proton equilibrium association constants to the unliganded Hb for the first (i.e. on the alkaline side) and the second apparent protonation event (i.e. on the acidic limb), respectively. P is the binding polynomial for the two protons to the unliganded Hb (i.e. P = 1 + K1[H+] + K1K2[H+]2). Equation 1 implies that protonation events are much faster than the CO binding rate constants, and this assumption is supported by the observation of a single exponential in human adult Hb. This equation underlies the existence of only two apparent protonating groups, which are functionally affecting the dynamic CO binding behavior of human adult Hb as well as of C. kumu Hb. Even though some authors have shown that a fairly large number of residues may be potentially involved in proton-linked functional effects (21Matthew J.B. Hanania G.I.H. Gurd F.R.N. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1919-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Ho C. Russu I. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6299-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Ho C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 153-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only relatively few amino acids have been demonstrated to play a major role in modulating ligand binding properties (8Perutz M.F. Annu.

In this case, the excellent fitting given in Fig. 1 clearly indicates that there is no need to imply more than two classes of protonating residues affecting CO binding kinetics of human adult Hb and of C. kumu Hb, even though each class indeed may be formed by several residues displaying closely similar pKa values. Therefore, in what follows singly protonated means that only the first class of groups has been protonated, whereas doubly protonated indicates that also the second lower pKa class has been protonated.Table IValues of parameters used for the description of the pH dependence of the CO binding to C. kumu Hb (fast and slow chains) and to human adult Hb, at 21°CC. kumu HbHuman adult HbFast chainSlow chainWithout ATPl′0 (M−1 s−1)8.8 (± 0.2) × 1058.8 (± 0.2) × 1053.2 (± 0.1) × 105l′1 (M−1 s−1)3.4 (± 0.3) × 1045.4 (± 0.4) × 1032.8 (± 0.2) × 104l′2 (M−1 s−1)2.1 (± 0.1) × 1062.1 (± 0.2) × 1063.0 (± 0.3) × 107pK17.6 ± 0.28.2 ± 0.16.9 ± 0.1pK24.6 ± 0.22.9 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.2+ 3 mM ATPl′0 (M−1 s−1)3.3 (± 0.2) × 1053.3 (± 0.2) × 105l′1 (M−1 s−1)1.3 (± 0.3) × 1056.1 (± 0.3) × 103l′2 (M−1 s−1)2.5 (± 0.2) × 1062.5 (± 0.2) × 106pK17.6 ± 0.38.6 ± 0.1pK24.4 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Parameters reported in Table I suggest that the marked functional heterogeneity in C. kumu Hb can be related to a functional kinetic difference between α- and β-subunits only in the singly protonated tetramer (i.e. at pH ≈ 6). Thus, the latter is the most interesting form, being characterized in the slow-reacting subunit by second-order rate constants, which are unusually slow for CO binding (see l′1 in Table I). On the other hand, at alkaline pH C. kumu Hb displays a second-order rate constant for the two subunits which is significantly faster than that observed in human adult Hb (see Fig. 1 and Table I). Therefore, in C. kumu Hb lowering pH from 9 to 6 brings about a dramatic decrease of the CO binding rate constant (at least in the absence of ATP), much larger than in adult human Hb, this being especially relevant for one type of subunit (see Fig. 1, panels A and B). An additional peculiar aspect of the first protonation event (on the alkaline side) is the fact that the pKa of the transition is fairly high in both chains (pKa = 7.6 and 8.2 for the fast and slow subunit, respectively; see Table I) with respect to human adult Hb (pKa = 6.9; see Table I). Moreover, the pKa value differs between the two subunits by ≈0.6 and ≈1.0 pH unit in the absence and presence of 3 mM ATP, respectively (see Fig. 1 and Table I). On the basis of Equation 1 and of parameters reported in Table I we can state that at the alkaline pH limit l′obs≈ l′0, since under these conditions the binding polynomial turns out to be P ≈ 1 (≫(K1[H+] + K1K2[H+]2)), whereas at the acid pH limit l′obs≈ l′2 because the binding polynomial is P ≈ K1K2[H+]2 (≫(1 + K1[H+])). At intermediate pH values, that is at the bottom of the well for the pH dependence (see Fig. 1), we have the predominance (i.e. > 90%) of singly protonated species, so that the binding polynomial is P ≈ K1[H+] (≫(1 + K1K2[H+]2)), and l′obs approximates l′1. Therefore, the activation energy parameters indeed can be reasonably ascribed to the unprotonated (at pH 8.9 ± 0.2), to the apparent singly protonated (at pH 6.0 ± 0.2), and to the apparent doubly protonated form (at pH 2.5 ± 0.1) (see Fig. 1). The good linearity of the Arrhenius plot at the selected pH values (Fig. 2) confirms the hypothesis that at each of these pH values we are indeed observing the activation energy of only one of the three species mentioned above. This evidence allows us to calculate the transition state parameters (24Eyring H. J. Chem. Phys. 1935; 3: 107-122Crossref Scopus (3049) Google Scholar) of the unprotonated, singly protonated and doubly protonated forms for the CO binding kinetics to human adult Hb and to both subunits of C. kumu Hb at 20°C, using the molar concentration of the ligand as a reference (see Table II).Table IIActivation parameters for CO binding to C. kumu Hb at 20°C, normalized for 1 M ligand concentrationC. kumu HbActivation parameters at:pH 8.9pH 6 (fast)pH 6 (slow)pH 2.5kJ/molEa28.9 (± 1.3)31.0 (± 1.1)86.2 (± 2.8)33.3 (± 1.2)δG‡39.2 (± 1.2)44.3 (± 1.2)50.0 (± 1.4)37.2 (± 1.0)δH‡26.4 (± 1.2)28.5 (± 1.0)83.8 (± 2.5)30.9 (± 1.1)TδS‡−12.8 (± 1.2)−15.8 (± 1.8)+33.8 (± 3.2)−6.3 (± 0.3)Human adult HbActivation parameters at:pH 8.9pH 6.0pH 2.5kJ/molEa28.7 (± 1.2)24.8 (± 1.1)26.6 (± 1.4)δG‡41.5 (± 1.3)44.3 (± 1.2)33.0 (± 1.0)δH‡26.3 (± 1.2)22.4 (± 1.1)24.2 (± 1.4)TδS‡−15.2 (± 1.3)−21.9 (± 1.5)−8.8 (± 0.4) Open table in a new tab A first look at the parameters reported in Table II reveals that lowering pH from 9.0 to 6.0 has a completely different effect for the two chains of C. kumu Hb (see Table II). The very marked kinetic heterogeneity significantly decreases as temperature rises (see Fig. 2, panel B), whereas it is enhanced as the temperature is decreased. Therefore, the reaction of the two subunits with CO in the apparent singly protonated species displays a large difference between the two chains in the activation energy Ea, and thus for the activation enthalpy δH‡ (= Ea− RT). This results in a totally different reaction mechanism for the two types of subunits, which is enthalpy-driven for the fast-reacting chain, whereas it is entropy-driven for the slow-reacting subunit (see Table II). The occurrence of a positive entropy change for the formation of the transition state suggests that the very slow binding rate constant of the slow-reacting subunit in the singly protonated form is likely to be related to some proton-linked bond(s), which strongly impair(s) the conformational change of the heme pocket required for the formation of the HbCO adduct. The behavior observed for human adult Hb is more similar to that of the fast-reacting chain of C. kumu. Thus, at alkaline pH human adult Hb and C. kumu Hb display closely similar values for the activation enthalpy, the lower second-order rate constant of human adult Hb being referrable only to a more negative activation entropy (see Table II). Lowering the pH from 9 to 6 is characterized by a slight decrease for the activation enthalpy, the activation entropy becoming significantly more negative in the case of human adult Hb (see Table II). The different trend of energetic parameters in the two Hbs, associated to the difference in the pKa of the process (see Table I), indeed seems to suggest that, in spite of the similar CO binding rate constant at pH 6.0, a somewhat different mechanism is underlying the alkaline transition in human adult Hb and in the fast-reacting chain of C. kumu Hb. A structural interpretation of this behavior is not straightforward, since there are a large number of substitutions in the heme pocket of C. kumu Hb with respect to human adult Hb, and some of them might have closely similar pKa values, thus belonging to the same class of protonating residues and contributing to the same proton-linked transition. Therefore, in what follows we attempt to discuss their role, also taking into account the effects produced by each substitution in human mutants. In the case of human adult Hb, the alkaline transition observed for CO binding displays a pKa value, which is consistent with the protonation of a histidyl residue, and it can be tentatively attributed to the distal His. On the other hand, the fairly high pKa values for the alkaline transition of the two subunits of C. kumu (see Fig. 1 and Table I) do not find an obvious explanation, and a more careful analysis of the alterations in the heme pocket of the two subunits is required. In this respect, C. kumu Hb displays some potentially important substitutions with respect to human adult Hb, namely (i) on the distal portion of the heme pocket residue E11 of both chains is Ile instead of Val; (ii) LysE3 and LysE10 of the β-subunit, close to distal HisE7, are replaced by Glu and Thr, respectively; (iii) Lys replaces Ser in CD3β; (iv) Lys is present in F7α (i.e. immediately next to proximal HisF8), a position occupied by Leu in human adult Hb; and (v) Lys is observed in F6β, where Glu is present in human adult Hb (16Fago A.

Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. Elsevier North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971: 2-6Google Scholar). Even though the substitution of ValE11 by Ile has been found to be relevant for the reactivity of CO toward the R state of β-mutants of human adult Hb (25Mathews A.J. Rohlfs R.J. Olson J.S. Tame J. Renaud J.-P. Nagai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16573-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a major contribution from this residue to the alkaline protonation process reported in Fig. 1 appears unlikely. It seems more convincing to identify a potentially responsible factor for the effect, at least in the β-subunits of C. kumu Hb, in the large electrostatic variation related to the substitution of Lys by Glu in E3β and of Lys by Thr in E10β in the distal portion of the heme pocket. This is likely to bring about a large raising in the proton affinity of distal HisE7, which could attain a value of pKa≫ 7, as observed in the fast-reacting subunit of C. kumu Hb. It should be noticed that the apparent pKa of GluE3β is likely to be further decreased by closely positioned LysCD3β. On the other hand, the occurrence of LysF7α in the proximal portion of the heme pocket is unique in C. kumu Hb, and a positively charged residue (i.e. ArgF7α) has been previously observed in this position only in the low affinity human adult mutant Hb Moabit (26Knuth A. Pribilla W. Marti H.R. Winterhalter K.H. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 1979; 61: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The role played by the residue in F7 on the regulation of functional properties has been clearly demonstrated in the case of mutants of pig myoglobin, where in the native molecule SerF7 forms an H-bond with Nδ of proximal His (27Smerdon S.J. Krzywda S. Wilkinson A.J. Brantley Jr., R.E. Carver T.E. Hargrove M.S. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5132-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In C. kumu Hb the occurrence of a positively charged lysyl residue at F7α in place of Leu (present in human adult Hb) might be responsible for a relevant alteration of the conformation of the proximal portion of the heme pocket, dramatically reducing the reactivity toward CO. Therefore, the protonation of LysF7α might be responsible for the dramatic reduction of CO binding second-order rate constant of α-chains in C. kumu Hb, possibly attributing the pKa > 8.0 observed in the slow-reacting subunit of C. kumu Hb to this process and to the α-chain (see Fig. 1 and Table I). Although the observed pKa value (= 8.2, see Table I) is ≈2 pH unit lower than that of free lysine, such a decrease indeed can be related to the burying of LysF7α inside the proximal portion of the heme pocket, and to the consequent separation from the bulk solvent. The two additional substitutions with respect to human adult Hb, which are observed in the distal portions of the heme pocket in α-chains of C. kumu (where AsnE10α replaces Lys at a heme contact position and SerE3α replaces Gln next to distal His), should not bring about electrostatic alterations. Furthermore, in the β-subunits of C. kumu Hb the presence of LysF6β, which substitutes Glu (present in human adult Hb) near proximal HisF8, could be partially responsible for the reduced O2 affinity and CO binding second-order rate constant, since a similar effect is observed in the human adult mutant Hb Agenogi, where GluF6β is substituted by Lys (28Miyaji R. Suzuki H. Ohba Y. Shibata S. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1966; 14: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Below pH 6, an acidic protonation process can be observed, which brings about a marked enhancement of the CO binding rate constant to both C. kumu Hb and human adult Hb (see Fig. 1). This second protonation is reminiscent of that described previously in human adult Hb (10Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18286-18289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in other monomeric and dimeric hemoproteins (9Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Traylor T.G. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4151-4155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Coletta M. Boffi A. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. Chiancone E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and it may be referred to the protonation of the Nϵ atom of the HisF8 imidazole ring, and the consequent cleavage (or severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond. This interpretation seems supported by the observation that the transient absorption spectrum of unliganded C. kumu Hb in the visible region displays features characteristic of a tetracoordinated heme (see Fig. 3, and Ref. 9Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Traylor T.G. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4151-4155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In C. kumu Hb the pKa value is drastically different for the two subunits both in the absence and presence of 3 mM ATP (see Fig. 1, and Table I). Such a behavior clearly indicates that in the singly protonated species the conformation of the proximal side of the heme pocket is markedly different in the two chains, this being reflected in a much lower energy for the cleavage of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond in the fast-reacting chain than in the slow-reacting subunit (by ≈10 and 6 kJ/mol in the absence and presence of ATP, respectively). The cleavage (or severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond essentially abolishes the kinetic functional heterogeneity (see Fig. 1), which (together with the pKa difference for the protonation process) suggests that the structural basis of the chain kinetic difference mostly resides in the conformation of the proximal side of the heme pocket in the singly protonated species. However, it must be remarked that the asymptotic value of C. kumu Hb (l′2 = 2.1 × 106M−1 s−1) is much lower than that of human adult Hb (l′2 = 3.0 × 107 M−1 s−1). Such a difference indicates that, even in the absence (or severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond, the ligand kinetic pathway for the interaction with the heme iron displays a larger activation free energy in C. kumu Hb than in human adult Hb (see Table II). In the absence of a proximal control, this effect can only be attributed to differences in the distal portion of the heme pocket between human adult Hb (showing ValE11 in both subunits) and C. kumu Hb, where both chains display IleE11 (16Fago A. Romano M. Tamburrini M. Coletta M. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which is known to represent a larger barrier for ligand binding (25Mathews A.J. Rohlfs R.J. Olson J.S. Tame J. Renaud J.-P. Nagai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16573-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of the CO binding kinetics has been investigated also at pH 2.5 (see Fig. 2, panel C, a condition in which no heterogeneous kinetic behavior is observed in C. kumu Hb (see Fig. 1). The analysis of the activation parameters for the single dynamic process observed at this pH clearly shows that the cleavage (or severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond in human adult Hb and in the fast-reacting chain of C. kumu Hb brings about an increase of the CO binding rate constant, which is merely due to a decrease of the negative activation entropy (see Table II). This indicates that the modulation of the heme iron reactivity (and thus of the movement in the heme plane upon ligand binding) by the proximal bond is regulated through the activation entropy of the process without significantly influencing the activation enthalpy (see Table II). In the slow-reacting subunit of C. kumu Hb, the rate enhancement at acidic pH values is regulated by two opposite effects, taking place upon cleavage of the proximal bond, namely (i) a drastic reduction of the activation enthalpy, and (ii) a negativization of the activation entropy, which was positive for the singly protonated form of this chain at pH 6.0 (see Table II). This different contribution must be certainly attributed to the peculiar features of the singly protonated form of the slow-reacting subunit of C. kumu Hb, in which the cleavage (or severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond brings about a conformational transition, which is different from that observed for the same phenomenon in human adult Hb and in the fast-reacting subunit of C. kumu Hb. Therefore, it seems that in the singly protonated species the slow-reacting subunits are held in a very unreactive conformation, possibly involving mainly the proximal side of the heme pocket, such as to decrease the mobility of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond for ligand binding. The cleavage (or severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond at low pH then releases such a strong constraint in the slow-reacting subunit, which is the cause of the marked functional kinetic heterogeneity at neutral pH, and the reactivity toward CO recovers a value essentially undistinguishable from that of the partner subunit. The unusually low pKa value for this acid protonation process in the slow-reacting subunit (pKa < 3.0), as compared with that of human adult Hb (≈3.4; see Fig. 1, panel A, and Ref. 10Coletta M. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18286-18289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is in keeping with this interpretation, indicating a very rigid proximal side in the singly protonated form at pH ≈ 6.0, or in any event an environment unfavorable to the stereochemical changes of the proximal side that take place upon ligand binding (7Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 327-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 31Baldwin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 175-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a comparison in C. kumu Hb between the unprotonated tetramer at pH 8.9 and the doubly protonated species at pH 2.5 shows that the observed similarity for the values of CO binding bimolecular rate constants (see Table I, Table II) is only fortuitous, since it stems from meaningfully different contributions of the activation enthalpy and entropy. Thus, in the unprotonated molecule the positive value of δH‡ is lower than in the doubly protonated tetramer, whereas the negative contribution of the activation entropy is smaller in the doubly protonated tetramer. Such an observation seems in line with the possibility that the cleavage (or severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond regulates the CO binding kinetics mostly reducing the entropy loss required for the formation of the activated complex, this being true also for human adult Hb (see Table II). In conclusion, the reported behavior suggests that the dramatic functional kinetic heterogeneity in CO binding to C. kumu Hb is likely to be referrable to structural variations of the heme pocket with respect to human adult Hb, mostly located in the distal portion of the β-chains and on the proximal side of the α-subunits. Therefore, in the two chains of C. kumu Hb CO binding reactivity is regulated through a different mechanism, which becomes evident only in the singly protonated species, since different protonating groups are altering to a different extent the energetic parameters along the first protonation process on the alkaline side. Furthermore, this investigation also brings to evidence that the cleavage (or severe weakening) of the proximal HisF8-Fe bond, which is induced by the second protonation event, brings about a relevant enhancement of the binding second-order rate constant mostly through a reduction of the entropy increase required for the formation of the transition state. This observation clearly indicates that the degrees of freedom for the movement of the unliganded iron in the heme plane (and thus the entropy changes accompanying this stereochemical variation) are an important factor along the reaction pathway of CO binding. In addition, the effect of ATP can be detected only for the pKa of the transitions in the slow-reacting chains, suggesting that this heterotropic ligand contributes to an alteration of the conformation mostly on these subunits, with a marked weakening (by ≈4 kJ/mol) of the proximal bond."
https://openalex.org/W1987200491,"Chemical modification implicates arginine residues of the Cerebratulus lacteus neurotoxin B-IV in biological activity. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the functional contributions of each of these residues. Panels of mutants at each site have been constructed by polymerase chain reaction and recombinant proteins expressed and purified to homogeneity using an Escherichia coli expression system developed in this laboratory. All substitutions for Arg-17 (Gln, Ala, or Lys) yield proteins having undetectable levels of activity, while charge neutralizing replacement of Arg-25 (R25Q) causes a 400-fold reduction in specific toxicity. However, the R25K mutein is almost as active as natural toxin. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that there are no major conformational changes in any of these muteins. These results therefore demonstrate the requirement for a guanidinium group at position 17, and a positive charge at position 25. NMR analyses (Hansen, P. E., Kem, W. R., Bieber, A. L., and Norton, R. S. (1992) Eur. J. Biochem. 210, 231-240) reveal neurotoxin B-IV to contain two antiparallel α-helices, which together include 57% of the sequence. Both Arg-17 and Arg-25 lie on the same face of the N-terminal helix (residues 13-26), as do the carboxyl groups of Glu-13 and Asp-21. However, charge neutralizing mutations of the latter two sites have no effects on biological activity. Arg-34, situated near the N terminus of helix 2 (residues 33-49) is also important for activity, as its replacement by Gln or Ala diminishes activity by 20- and 80-fold, respectively. However, unlike Arg-17 and Arg-25, thermal denaturation experiments suggest that R34Q may be structurally destabilized relative to wild-type B-IV."
