https://openalex.org/W1578547237,"Abstract Treatment of erythrocytes with galactose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.9) followed by reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride (NaB3H4) at pH 7.4 allowed labeling of galactosyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues on external surfaces of cells with tritium (3H). Labeling patterns and specific activities of galactose and galactosamine in glycolipids and glycoproteins were determined after separation with gel electrophoresis and thin layer chromatography. The labeling patterns of normal adult cells differed greatly from fetal cells, and were significantly altered when cell surfaces were modified by proteases and neuraminidase. The results of analysis indicated that (a) carbohydrate moieties of two glycolipids (globoside and ceramide trihexoside) and at least three glycoproteins (molecular weight 9.5, 8.2, and 6.4 x 104) were exposed to external environment, but not ceramide dihexoside, ceramide monohexoside, or other glycoproteins with higher molecular weights; (b) specific activities of galactosamine in glycolipid and of galactose in glycoprotein increased after protease treatment, although total activity of glycoprotein did not change; (c) labeling of glycoprotein was greatly enhanced by neuraminidase treatment, while that of glycolipid was enhanced to a lesser degree; (d) the relative exposures of glycoprotein and glycolipid differed greatly between normal and fetal erythrocyte surfaces. Glycoproteins of fetal cells had a very low label as compared to glycolipid."
https://openalex.org/W1570569542,"Abstract The structure of the bacterial ferredoxin from Peptococcus aerogenes (54 amino acids) has been determined at 2.8 A resolution. The molecule is a prolate ellipsoid with approximate dimension of 22 x 27A. The iron and sulfur atoms are in two complexes 12 A apart with 4 iron, 4 inorganic sulfur, and 4 cysteine sulfur atoms in each. Cys 8, 11, 14, and 45 are coordinated to iron atoms in one complex and Cys 18, 35, 38, and 41 are coordinated to iron in the other. The two tyrosine groups present in the molecule are oriented in a similar way with respect to the complexes: Tyr 2 is parallel to and apparently in contact with one face of one complex and Tyr 28 is oriented similarly with respect to the other. Both tyrosine rings have an edge exposed to the solvent. The structure was solved with three isomorphous derivatives, at first used independently but later combined, to determine phases for the native data. Refinement of the structure has been initiated with 2 A resolution data."
https://openalex.org/W2070616620,"It is difficult to recognize portraits that have been coarsely sampled and quantized. Blurring such images improves recognition. A simple, straightforward explanation is that high-frequency noise introduced by the sampling and quantizing must be removed by low-pass filtering to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and hence signal detectability or recognition. Experiments reported here, suggested on the basis of a different model, show instead that noise bands that are spectrally adjacent to the picture's spectrum are considerably more effective in suppressing recognition."

Several mutants show a specific increase in the level of free methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1678704767,"Factor VIII (antihemophilic factor) has been purified approximately 500-fold from the cryoprecipitate fraction of human plasma. The isolation procedure involves adsorption of contaminants with A1(OH)3, column chromatography on tricalcium citrate-cellulose, precipitation with concanavalin A, and an agarose gel filtration step. The final product is homogeneous when examined by zone electrophoresis, sedimentation equilibrium, and immunoelectrophoresis. The molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium is 1.12 million ± 98,000. After reduction of the protein with 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, subunits are formed which migrate as one band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zone electrophoresis. The subunits are heterogeneous, however, in the ultracentrifuge, apparently due to substantial aggregation. The smallest species which could be detected has a molecular weight of 105,000 ± 5,000. The molecular weight of the subunit determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis was 240,000. The latter value may be high, however, due to the fact that human Factor VIII contains approximately 6% carbohydrate (hexose, hexosamine, and neuraminic acid) and the molecular weights of glycoproteins determined by SDS gel electrophoresis tend to be high. Antibodies prepared in rabbits against human Factor VIII inhibit both human and bovine Factor VIII activity. Antibodies to the highly purified human Factor VIII also form a precipitin line in immunoelectrophoresis experiments with the cryoprecipitate fraction prepared from hemophilic plasma, indicating that an abnormal Factor VIII molecule is present in the plasma of individuals with classic hemophilia. Other general properties of human Factor VIII, including its amino acid composition, thrombin modification, and turnover in hemophilic dogs, are also reported."

https://openalex.org/W1595103650,"There is a general correlation between the relative degradation rate and the size of soluble proteins from rat liver. The subunit size rather than the multimer size appears to influence the rate of degradation, since subunits which make up multimers of a single size range are degraded at heterogeneous rates with larger subunits being degraded more rapidly than smaller ones. Soluble proteins which are degraded more rapidly in vivo tend also to be more susceptible to proteolysis in vitro with either Pronase or trypsin. Furthermore, there is a general correlation between the molecular size of soluble proteins, as determined by Sephadex chromatography, and their in vitro susceptibility to proteolysis. These results suggest that the relative degradation rates of soluble proteins are determined at least in part by their inherent susceptibility to proteases. The correlation between size and relative rate of degradation in vivo is also present for soluble proteins from rat kidney, testes, brain, and muscle, and from HeLa cells and pea stem sections. These findings indicate that the correlation between size and degradation rate may be a general characteristic of intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes."

The enzyme preparation is shown to be homogeneous by equilibrium centrifugation and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme is insensitive to extreme pH levels ranging from pH 4.5 to 10.5, is stable in 5 m urea at pH 4.5, and is insensitive to 20% acetone or ethanol. The mass of the enzyme is 45,520 daltons by equilibrium centrifugation assuming a v of 0.74 cc g-1. The enzyme appears to consist of one polypeptide chain with molecular weight measured to be 44,000 on gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1499988740,"Abstract A procedure is described for the purification of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II of the human tissue culture cell lines HeLa and KB. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 500,000 and in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels invariably shows 3 subunits with molecular weights of 220,000, 140,000, and 35,000. In addition there perhaps is a fourth subunit of about 25,000 daltons or less in mass and a subunit of 170,000 daltons occurring in variable amounts. RNA polymerase II has a strong preference for single-stranded over double-stranded DNA as template and is most active in the presence of 1.5 to 3 mm Mn++ as divalent cation. We also describe the partial purification of two stimulatory factors (SF-A and SF-B) which specifically stimulate the activity of RNA polymerase II in the presence of double-stranded DNA as template."
https://openalex.org/W1994375281,Mudpuppy rod and cone responses differ both in time course of recovery and in absolute sensitivity. Rods are about 25 times more sensitive than cones and appear to generate a larger voltage per quantum absorbed. Comparison of mudpuppy receptor sensitivities to those of other vertebrates suggests that the difference in sensitivity between rods and cones may be a general phenomenon.
https://openalex.org/W1556300555,"Abstract 24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25-(OH)2D3) gives a marked increase in intestinal calcium transport and serum calcium concentration of vitamin D-deficient rats fed a diet containing adequate calcium and phosphorus. These responses occur after a considerable time lag following administration of the metabolite. The 24,25-(OH)2D3 on a long term basis and at low doses has striking activity in the stimulation of intestinal calcium transport but not bone calcium mobilization. Radioactive 24,25-(OH)2D3 is metabolized to a more polar compound which increases in concentration in serum, intestinal mucosa, and bone over a 48-hour period. Nephrectomy or the feeding of a high calcium diet abolishes the stimulation of intestinal calcium transport by 24,25-(OH)2D3 and the in vivo genesis of the more polar compound from tritiated 24,25-(OH)2D3. It is concluded that 24,25-(OH)2D3, the usual dihydroxy metabolite of vitamin D3 in normal rats, has potential physiological importance through its conversion to a more polar metabolite. This metabolite possibly acts to facilitate intestinal calcium absorption without stimulating bone calcium mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W2052813052,"Three methods can be used to search for evidence of natural selection from admixture studies. These include classification of the admixture estimates into two groups; calculation of the rank correlation between estimates from more than one population; and the testing of admixture estimates for homogeneity. The use of these methods is discussed with special reference to black-white admixture in the United States. Using revised estimates of African gene frequencies, derived from a consideration of the geographical origin of the slaves, we calculated admixture estimates and their variances for five U.S. black populations; Claxton (Georgia); Sapelo Island (Georgia); James Island (South Carolina); Charleston (South Carolina); Oakland (California). Two out of the five populations yielded heterogeneous admixture estimates but all other tests were non-significant. The data provide little evidence for the action of selection. The few, inconsistent significant results are more indicative of the action of random drift or biased gene frequency estimates than natural selection, and in general these effects cannot be differentiated. It seems doubtful that admixture studies can ever provide unequivocal evidence for the action of natural selection in human populations. In the search for natural selection, perhaps admixture studies should only be used as a preliminary screening device."
https://openalex.org/W1954043762,"Abstract The retinol-binding protein (RBP) and thyroxine-binding prealbumin were isolated from rat serum. Under physiological conditions RBP and prealbumin form a protein complex. Rat RBP exhibited characteristics very similar to those previously encountered for the human and monkey counterparts, including the association constant to prealbumin (8 x 106 m-1). Thyroxine-binding prealbumin in rat is in contrast to its human counterpart the major thyroxine carrying plasma protein. Its molecular weight differs from that of the human protein (51,000 and 62,000, respectively) in spite of its similar binding constant for thyroxine. The role of the vitamin A-transporting protein complex was investigated with respect to the tissue distribution of [3H-]-vitamin A in normal and vitamin A-deficient rats. It was demonstrated that the hepatocytes which stored virtually all liver vitamin A could rapidly mobilize newly administered vitamin, and the retinol occurred exclusively bound to RBP. The mobilization of liver vitamin A was unaffected by prior actinomycin D treatment of the rats, which suggests that newly synthesized RBP requires retinol for its release from the hepatocytes. An investigation was also undertaken of the role of the kidney as a storage organ for vitamin A. Kinetic measurements showed that the kidney received most of its vitamin A from RBP in contrast to the liver which gets its main supply from the chylomicrons. Fractionation of kidney cortex cells on a discontinuous silica gel gradient indicated that most vitamin A resided in tubular cells. The vitamin-containing cell fractions were shown to possess the property to take up RBP in vivo. These results suggest that some vitamin A may reach the kidney by a process of glomerular filtration followed by tubular reabsorption."
https://openalex.org/W2000793708,Antibody distinct from that involved in neutralization and directed to an antigen (AG-4) induced in HEp-2 cells by infection with herpesvirus type 2 was identified in serums from patients with cervical carcinoma by means of a quantitative micro complement fixation test. The presence of antibody to AG-4 correlates well with the extent of the tumor; antibody is virtually absent in matched control women and in women with therapy and without recurrent neoplasia. Reactivity is not observed with control antigen consisting of a cell extract prepared from uninfected HEp-2 cells. The possible prognostic significance of this antibody and its implications are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1642077045,"Abstract The inner membrane from rat and beef liver mitochondria was shown to provide a barrier to the passage of fatty acyl-CoA derivatives, as determined by the absence of reduction of flavoproteins associated with the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and the electron transferring flavoprotein when palmitoyl-CoA was incubated with inner membrane mitochondrial particles in the absence of l-carnitine. Carnitine palmitoyl-transferase was observed to be present on both sides of the inner membrane but not on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Antibodies which inactivated carnitine palmitoyl-transferase I and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II were found to inhibit the carnitine palmitoyltransferase reaction on the external surfaces of the inner membrane, but only those antibodies which inactivated carnitine palmitoyltransferase II inhibited the carnitine palmitoyltransferase reaction on the internal surface of the inner membrane of beef liver mitochondria. Data are also presented showing that the flavoprotein reduced following the addition of acyl-l-carnitine or acyl-CoA plus l-carnitine is probably the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and not the electron transferring protein."

https://openalex.org/W1558277290,"Abstract Isotopically labeled, native 40 S ribosomal subunits isolated from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells were added to a reticulocyte cell-free protein-synthesizing system. The exogenous subunits became incorporated into polyribosomal ribosomes, demonstrating that they underwent the reactions of initiation in the heterologous cell-free system. The specific activity of the polyribosomal ribosomes after incubation was considerably higher than that of the monomeric ribosomes. When labeled Ehrlich polyribosomes were incubated in this system, the native subunits generated from polyribosomal ribosomes released at chain termination were also of much higher specific activity than the monomeric ribosomes. These data support other evidence that in mammalian cells subunits cycle rapidly and are direct intermediates in protein synthesis while the majority of monomeric ribosomes are the product of a side reaction. When exogenous subunits were present during ribosome runoff under conditions preventing initiation, they became incorporated into the monomeric ribosomes which accumulated. Although other possibilities are not excluded, this is consistent with the hypothesis that ribosomes are released at chain termination as separate subunits which may either become native subunits and recyle or may recombine to form monomers, the added subunits entering monomers by competing in the recombination reaction. The mechanism directing ribosomes at chain termination into the pool of native subunits or into the pool of monomeric ribosomes was studied by comparing native subunits with subunits derived from monomeric ribosomes (by treatment with 0.5 m KCl). Whereas the ribosome-derived 40 and 60 S subunits recombined to form monomers, neither the native 40 S nor the native 60 S subunits combined with the complementary ribosome-derived subunit. The native 40 S subunit contains proteins which are absent from the 40 S subunits of ribosomes, and when these were removed by 0.5 m KCl the native 40 S subunit regained affinity for the ribosome-derived 60 S subunit. We hypothesize that binding of accessory proteins to the 40 S subunit released at chain termination channels it into the native subunit pool, while recombination with the 60 S subunit diverts it into the monomer pool. The mechanism modifying the 60 S subunit was not elucidated."

https://openalex.org/W1480096051,"Abstract A number of insulin-like and proinsulin-like polypeptides were employed in the study of the structure-activity relationship of proinsulin. Glucose incorporation into CO2 and lipids, and the antilipolytic activity, were used as parameters to measure the biological activity of these polypeptides. The split proinsulin and the long A chain proinsulin, with 2 connecting amino acid residues, Arg-Arg, missing, have little more activity over that of native proinsulin. The long B chain proinsulin, with the absence of 2 connecting amino acid residues, Lys-Arg, has a 3- to 4-fold increase in activity compared to proinsulin. Further removal of amino acid residues from proinsulin molecule beyond Lys-Arg level can progressively increase proinsulin activity. These studies suggest that the decreased biological activity of proinsulin may be due essentially to the blocking of the A chain of insulin part in proinsulin molecule rather than the blocking of B chain. Insulin, with 1 or 2 arginine residues attached to COOH-terminal of B chain, loses 60% biological activity when compared to insulin molecule. The effect of positively charged groups may alter the insulin conformation or decrease the binding capacity between the insulin derivatives and the insulin receptor site, or both. C-peptide, a by-product in the proinsulin conversion to insulin, shows no insulin-like activity in homologous and heterologous fat tissues. No antagonistic or potentiating effect of C-peptide for insulin or proinsulin can be demonstrated in homologous and heterologous fat tissues. The feedback control of C-peptide on insulin or proinsulin action is not likely to exist in the adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1540374583,"Abstract Phenylalanine hydroxylase-stimulating protein markedly stimulates phenylalanine hydroxylase activity under various conditions and thus may serve a critical function in phenylalanine metabolism. At pH values above neutrality, or in the presence of phospholipids such as lysolecithin, when the naturally occurring cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, is used, the specific activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase decreases with increasing enzyme concentration. The stimulating effect of phenylalanine hydroxylase-stimulating protein is due to the relief of this decrease in specific activity. The stimulating protein has now been purified from rat liver more than 1000-fold over the crude extract. Electrophoresis of the stimulating protein on polyacrylamide gel reveals two main bands, both of which are active as stimulator and are identical in molecular weight. The molecular weight of this protein has been determined by light scattering, sedimentation-diffusion, and electrophoresis on different percentage acrylamide gels to be 51,500 ± 1,200. The 51,500 molecular weight form consists of four subunits of molecular weight 12,500 ± 400 as determined by gel electrophoresis in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate or in 8 m urea. The extinction coefficient at 280 nm and the amino acid composition of the stimulating protein have also been determined. On storage, higher aggregates of the stimulating protein are formed, which appear to be due to the formation of intermolecular disulfide linkages. Assays of crude extracts from normal and phenylketonuric human livers show that the stimulating protein is present at comparable levels in both livers. There is no species specificity with respect to the stimulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity by the stimulating protein; the rat liver hydroxylase can be stimulated by human liver stimulating protein, and the human liver hydroxylase by rat liver stimulating protein. Evidence presented in a subsequent report (Huang, C. Y., and Kaufman, S. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4242) indicates that the stimulating protein is an enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of an intermediate to product (or products) in the hydroxylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1484051386,"Abstract Inhibition of the microsomal testosterone 5α-reductase of human skin was studied with various steroids bearing structural resemblance to testosterone. Since three of the most potent inhibitors found, i.e. progesterone, deoxycorticosterone acetate, and 4-androsten-3-one-17β-carboxylic acid, were shown by kinetic studies to be competitive inhibitors of testosterone 5α-reduction, the degree of inhibition caused by the various steroids tested in this study has been related to structural features of the steroid-binding site of the enzyme. A strict requirement for a 3-keto-Δ4 structure was found for effective inhibitory activity of a steroid, suggesting a hydrophilic nature of the enzyme at the binding site in the vicinity of Ring A of the steroid molecule. A 17β (but not α) side chain containing one or more oxygen functional groups is another required feature of the inhibitory steroid molecule, suggesting another hydrophilic region on the enzyme at the point of attachment of the side chain. This region in contrast to the region around Ring A is likely to be open or flexible, in view of the larger allowable variations in size of the side chain without detriment to the inhibitory activity."

https://openalex.org/W2101896293,"Abstract The thermal denaturation of lysozyme in aqueous alcohol solutions has been investigated through ultraviolet difference spectrophotometry and optical rotation measurements. Alcohols used were CH3OH, C2H5OH, and C3H7OH; concentrations up to 50% (v/v) of alcohol in water were employed. It was found that upon increasing the size or the concentration of the aliphatic alcohol, the denaturation temperature is gradually depressed. At low alcohol concentration, the α helix content of the protein decreases through the thermal transition. However, on increasing alcohol size or concentration, the α helix content goes through a maximum during denaturation. Apparent equilibrium constants and corresponding van't Hoff heats of denaturation were determined. The data indicate that the depression of the denaturation temperature due to addition of alcohols is essentially entropy dependent. It is suggested that these results may be explained in terms of a theoretical expression containing a binding constant for the alcohol to the nonpolar sites of the protein plus a diluent term accounting for changes in the dilution parameters of different conformers."
https://openalex.org/W1605152717,"Abstract Addition of the nucleoside diphosphates CDP, UDP, TDP, and IDP to intact, respiring, rat liver mitochondria immediately following ATP formation results in a marked stimulation of respiration at all concentrations of nucleotide tested. Addition of GDP stimulates respiration when added at concentrations below 150 µm, whereas at higher concentrations this nucleotide has much less effect on respiration and prevents stimulation given by other nucleoside diphosphates. Half-maximal stimulation of respiration is provided by less than 150 µm of each nucleotide. Nucleoside triphosphate formation is associated directly with stimulation of respiration by nucleoside diphosphates. CTP, UTP, TTP, and ITP are formed in good yield at all concentrations of nucleoside diphosphate tested, whereas GTP is formed in best yield at concentrations of GDP below 150 µm. Concentrations of nucleoside diphosphates which give half-maximal rates of nucleoside triphosphate formation correlate well with concentrations necessary to give half-maximal stimulation of respiration. Concentrations of GDP higher than 150 µm inhibit both the formation of GTP and the formation of other nucleoside triphosphates. Oligomycin and 2,4-dinitrophenol, inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, also inhibit nucleoside triphosphate formation. Partial removal of nucleoside diphosphokinase localized in the outer mitochondrial compartment markedly reduces both nucleoside diphosphate stimulation of respiration and nucleoside triphosphate formation. Kinetic analysis of the solubilized preparation reveals typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the substrate pairs ATP-CDP, ATP-UDP, and ATP-TDP, a slight deviation from normal kinetic behavior for the substrate pair ATP-IDP, and a marked deviation from normal behavior for the substrate pair ATP-GDP. GDP is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme at concentrations exceeding 150 µm and, as a result, biphasic kinetic response curves are obtained when the substrate pair is ATP-GDP. Taken together these results show that ATP formation in intact rat liver mitochondria can be readily coupled to nucleoside triphosphate formation when nucleoside diphosphates are supplied exogenously, that nucleoside diphosphokinase localized in the outer mitochondrial compartment is intimately associated with the coupling process, and that GDP via its action on nucleoside diphosphokinase is a potent inhibitor of nucleoside triphosphate formation."
https://openalex.org/W1864610790,"Abstract Erythro-dl-[3-3H]sphinganine was injected directly into the brains of 14- to 15-day-old rats. After 2 hours, 2.0% of the injected radioactivity could be recovered in the ceramide fraction of the brain lipid extract. The ceramide material was fractionated by thin layer chromatography into the classes of N-acylsphinganine and N-acylsphingenine, containing approximately equal amounts of radioactivity. Free 3H-labeled long chain bases were recovered after alkaline hydrolysis of the two ceramide classes and confirmed to be sphinganine and sphingenine. The presence of tritium in the unsaturated base sphingenine indicates a direct conversion of sphinganine to sphingenine or an acylated sphinganine to acylated sphingenine. No free [3H]sphingenine could be demonstrated in the lipid extract indicating either that it is present in very small amounts, due perhaps to rapid acylation, or that it is not produced as the free base but rather through acylated sphinganine. A time study over 145 min of the incorporation of [3-3H]sphinganine into ceramides showed an initial rapid production of N-acyl-[3H]sphinganine, which stayed at a steady level for the duration, while N-acyl-[3H]sphingenine appeared more slowly but was the predimonate ceramide at the final set time. This suggests N-acylsphinganine may be the precursor of N-acylsphingenine. When N-[1-14C]stearoyl-[3-3H]sphinganine, with an isotope ratio of 2.22 (3H:14C), was the injected substrate, ceramide containing [3H]sphingenine and 14C fatty acid could be isolated. The observed isotone ratio for the N-acylsphingenine was 2.52, indicating an 87% retention of 14C compared to 3H. The similarity of ratios suggests a direct conversion of the injected ceramide to the isolated compound; the small loss of 14C due perhaps to some hydrolysis followed by resynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1497807760,"Abstract The complement of nuclear acidic proteins has been compared in erythroid cells of the duck embryo at different stages of development and in adult erythrocytes. Changes in the nuclear acidic proteins accompany alterations in the red cell population of the 7-day and 14-day embryo, when the primitive red cell series carrying fetal hemoglobins is replaced by a second definitive red cell series carrying the adult hemoglobin types. Further changes are observed in the nuclear proteins of the adult erythrocyte, including an accumulation of histone fraction F2c. Thus cells of similar morphology and function obtained at different stages of development can differ both in the nature of their major product, and in their complements of acidic nuclear proteins believed to play a role in selective transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1482372955,"Abstract At neutral pH, concentrations of creatine phosphate comparable to those found in skeletal muscle and heart are highly inhibitory toward rabbit skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase. Creatine phosphate appears to be competitive with phosphoenolpyruvate with a Ki of 2.0 mm. That it is not a simple competition, however, is indicated by the following evidence. The inhibition is increased in the presence of high concentrations of ADP. ATP, a known inhibitor of pyruvate kinase, acts synergistically with creatine phosphate; that is, in the presence of both ATP and creatine phosphate the inhibition is much greater than the sum of the actions of the inhibitors separately. No synergism is seen between ATP and the inhibitory substrate analogue, 2-phosphoglyceric acid. The characteristics of the creatine phosphate effect are quite distinct from the inhibition noted previously with phenylalanine. Phenylalanine inhibition is maximal above pH 8.0 whereas creatine phosphate is more potent at neutral pH. Alanine, which reverses phenylalanine inhibition, has no effect on creatine phosphate inhibition. Phenylalanine does not inhibit the Mn2+-activated enzyme whereas creatine phosphate inhibition is more potent in the presence of manganous ion. Rabbit erythrocyte pyruvate kinase is only slightly inhibited by creatine phosphate. In the presence of the activator, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, the inhibition is much more pronounced. The results are discussed in relation to the regulation of muscle glycolysis and it is suggested that falling creatine phosphate levels may be one of the primary factors contributing to the increase in glycolytic flux that accompanies muscle contraction."

https://openalex.org/W1594535327,"Abstract An acidic calcium-binding phosphoprotein has been isolated from beef adrenal medulla and purified to apparent homogeneity. The purification procedure employed ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and G-50. This protein, which appears to be the only soluble calcium-binding protein in adrenal medulla, shows high affinity calcium binding (Kd = 1.7 x 10-5 m) and binds 1 mole of calcium per mole of protein. Each mole of calcium-binding protein contains 1 mole of phosphate. The molecular weight was determined to be 11,900 by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. An acidic calcium-binding phosphoprotein was also isolated from beef brain and compared with the protein from beef adrenal medulla. The two proteins appear to be identical on the basis of electrophoretic migration in 15% acrylamide gels and 10% acrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, molecular weight, amino acid composition, and peptide maps. The protein is not found in other tissues including liver, kidney, lung, and parotid gland. It is suggested that this calcium-binding protein of brain may be associated with adrenergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1550300991,"Abstract l-[U-14C]Leucine incorporation into the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable fraction of mitochondria after incubation with succinate as energy source was significantly higher with normal rat liver mitochondria than with hypophysectomized rat liver mitochondria. The incorporation was sensitive to inhibition by chloramphenicol, terramycin, dinitrophenol, and NaCN, but not to RNase and cycloheximide. The differences in the rate of incorporation between the two types of mitochondria were not abolished when the endogenous energy source from succinate was replaced by an external ATP-generating mixture or when cold trichloroacetic acid precipitate was extracted with hot 5% trichloroacetic acid or when high concentrations of unlabeled leucine (up to 200 mm) were added. Uptake of l-[U-14C]leucine, in the absence of incorporation, was higher with hypophysectomized rat liver mitochondria than with normal rat liver mitochondria. However, when mitochondria were washed extensively after incubation there was no significant difference in the uptake. Growth hormone treatment of hypophysectomized rats for 5 days significantly increased both in vivo and in vitro incorporation of leucine. The in vitro stimulating effect of growth hormone became apparent as early as 15 min and was significant 30 min after a single intravenous injection of the hormone. These results suggest that growth hormone has a significant effect on liver mitochondrial protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1562829163,"Abstract The activities of three S-adenosylmethionine:protein methyltransferases (protein methylase I, II, and III) were measured throughout the mitotic cycle of synchronized HeLa S-3 cells in an attempt to determine the biological function of these enzymes. 1. The activities of protein methylase I and II, which catalyze the methylation of protein-arginine residues and carboxyl groups, increase more or less continuously until they have doubled by the end of G2 phase. These increases were not obviously correlated with major cell cycle events such as DNA replication or histone synthesis and modification. 2. The activity of protein methylase III (S-adenosylmethionine:protein-lysine methyltransferase) remains relatively constant through G1 and early S phase of the cell cycle, then begins increasing until it reaches over three to four times its initial level by the end of G2. The increase in protein methylase III activity is temporally correlated with the increased mono- and dimethylation of the e-amino groups of histone lysine residues. 3. By inhibiting protein and RNA synthesis it was determined that this increase in protein methylase III activity in late S and G2 of the HeLa cell cycle was probably due to the de novo synthesis of enzyme molecules of those times. 4. The same 3- to 4-fold increase in the activity of protein methylase III occurs at the usual time after mitosis even if DNA and histone synthesis were prevented by treatment of the cells with cytosine arabinoside. In such treated cells, the enzyme apparently overmethylated the already mono- and dimethylated lysine residues of previously synthesized histone molecules to the di- and trimethyllysine state. These data suggest that protein methylase III synthesis is not triggered by the appearance of its normal substrate but rather is coupled with some other unknown cell cycle event."
https://openalex.org/W1999244724,The number of primordial germ cells in embryos of known genotypic sex was the same in XY males and XX females until the gonad became recognizable as testis or ovary. It has been claimed that the heterogametic sex chromosome causes the gonad to differentiate as a testis in mammals and as an ovary in birds as a result of earlier and more mitoses. This claim was not supported in the present study where a sex difference in numbers of germ cells was first noted during differentiation of oocytes in the XX embryos.
https://openalex.org/W2076767019,"delta-Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase from Rhodopseudomonas spheroides was covalently linked to Sepharose 4B, which had been activated with cyanogen bromide. A column containing this enzyme gel readily catalyzed the synthesis of the pyrrole porphobilinogen on continuous passage of a solution of delta-aminolevulinic acid. Under the conditions of the procedures, product inhibition was minimized and a 50 to 94 percent yield was attained. A column containing about 1 milligram of enzyme was continuously operated for 27 days. Although its total activity appeared to be reduced about 30 percent at the end of this time, the bound enzyme produced approximately 200 milligrams of porphobilinogen each day, and about 5 grams of the pyrrole were isolated."
https://openalex.org/W1496582284,"Abstract The thermostable alkaline proteinase of thermophilic streptomycete, Streptomyces rectus var. proteolyticus, was rapidly and reversibly inactivated by equimolar p-chloromercuribenzoate (p-MB) or HgCl2. The inactivation was prevented by substrates. The enzyme which had been inhibited by diisopropyl phosphofluoridate was still able to bind p-MB with a markedly decreased velocity, while the enzyme whose —SH group had been blocked by p-MB or HgCl2 did not react with diisopropyl phosphofluoridate. A circular dichroism study showed that a slight conformational change was induced by blocking of the —SH group. The binding of p-MB to enzyme resulted in a marked decrease of thermostability, while the enzyme showed a higher resistance to protein-denaturing reagents than mesophilic alkaline proteinases. These results suggest strongly that the —SH group participates in a tight organization of the active site through which a high thermal stability may be expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1515670071,"In previous studies of the ribosome cycle in mammalian protein synthesis we have shown that during that portion of the cycle in which the ribosomal subunits occur as free or native particles, that is, after they are released at chain termination and before they rejoin the polyribosomal messenger RNA, the 40 S subunits appear predominantly in two forms, of buoyant density 1.49 and 1.40 g per cm3, referred to respectively as 40 S h (for higher buoyant density) and 40 S l (for lower buoyant density) native subunits. The intraribosomal 40 S subunits (i.e. 40 S subunits coupled to 60 S subunits in monomeric ribosomes or polyribosomes) are of buoyant density 1.51 g per cm3. These differences in density reflect the fact that in addition to the structural proteins found in intraribosomal subunits, certain extra, exchangeable proteins are bound to the native 40 S subunits, about 90,000 daltons to the 40 S h form and 750,000 daltons to the 40 S l form. On the basis of this and other evidence we proposed a model of protein synthesis in which the 40 S ribosomal subunit, after release at chain termination, sequentially binds several proteins required for initiating another round of protein synthesis, becoming first the 40 S h and then the 40 S l native subunit. In this paper we report that aurintricarboxylic acid, at a concentration which inhibits initiation specifically, prevents the binding of the proteins which convert the 40 S h native subunit to the 40 S l form, so that runoff in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid leads to the accumulation of 40 S h subunits and the disappearance of 40 S l subunits. Aurintricarboxylic acid also removes these proteins from pre-existing 40 S l subunits, converting them to particles identical in density with 40 S h subunits. A crude preparation of initiation factors, the ribosome KCl wash fraction, contains proteins which bind to ribosome-derived 40 S subunits (density 1.51 g per cm3), converting them to particles similar to 40 S h and 40 S l subunits (1.49 and 1.40 g per cm3). Aurintricarboxylic acid also prevents the binding of the KCl wash proteins which produce the 1.40 g per cm3 particles but not of those which yield the 1.49 g per cm3 particles. The binding of proteins to the subunit is 50% inhibited at a ratio of about 50 molecules of aurintricarboxylic acid per 40 S subunit, and the inhibition appears to be competitive. If the proteins binding to the 40 S l native subunit are indeed initiation factors, the inhibition of binding of these proteins by aurintricarboxylic acid explains the inhibition of initiation. The availability of an inhibitor acting at this site should prove useful."
https://openalex.org/W1529319866,"Abstract Previous studies indicated that the function of mutarotase (aldose-1-epimerase) in glucose metabolism in primitive organisms should have become redundant with the evolution of the phosphorylitic pathways of glucose utilization and suggested that in higher organisms the enzyme may have evolved into a component of a glucose transport system. In order to obtain some information on its evolutionary background, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity from a variety of species, including some mammalian embryonic forms, and the physical and catalytic properties were compared. Mutarotase content is highest in mammalian kidneys, comprising from 0.15 to 0.29% of the total soluble protein of this tissue. The catalytic coefficients (moles of α-glucose converted to β-glucose per mole of enzyme per min) of the purified enzymes ranged from 2.8 x 105 for rabbit to 1.0 x 106 for the bovine kidney enzyme, the most active mutarotase so far isolated. On the basis of Km values for glucose, mutarotases fall into two distinct groups: those with a Km of 19 mm (bovine adult, sheep, sheep embryo, hog, hog embryo, mouse, gerbil, and dog) and those with a Km of 12 mm (human, rabbit, toadfish, yellow perch, chicken, catfish, and newborn calf). In the ox, three different kinetic forms of the enzyme which have otherwise indistinguishable physical properties are present at different stages of development (embryo calf Km 5 mm, calf (0 to 6 months) 12 mm, and adult 19 mm). All forms of the enzyme have the same substrate specificity and are inhibited equally by inhibitors of glucose transport such as phloridzin, phloretin, and diethylstilbestrol. The molecular sizes and asymmetries of the enzymes were measured by sedimentation velocity in the ultracentrifuge, electrophoretic mobility, and gel permeation chromatography. All were monomers of the same size as indicated by the following values for the molecular weights: human kidney (37,500), bovine adult kidney (37,300), calf kidney (37,300), lamb kidney (38,100), embryo calf liver (38,000), rabbit kidney (36,700), chicken kidney (35,900), yellow perch kidney (35,800), guinea pig kidney (38,100), and green pepper (38,300). The Stokes radii averaged 31.4 ± 1.3 A, indicating similar molecular asymmetries. The corresponding frictional ratios (f:f0) in buffers of low osmolarity were about 1.37 and the enzymes from all species underwent an identical molecular transition, converting to a more compact form with an f:f0 of 1.17 in buffers of physiological ionic strength. This transformation was also monitored by measuring the changes induced in the filtration of purified bovine kidney mutarotase through Diaflo membranes and was shown to be specifically reversed by substrate sugars. The prolonged evolutionary history and apparently stable physical and catalytic properties of the enzyme, when taken in conjunction with the lack of a requirement in glucose metabolism, indicate that some significant alternative function must have evolved. The osmotic transformation undergone by all mutarotases may be relevant to this function, since it suggests a possible mechanism whereby sugar transport could be coupled to the osmotic gradients which are established during solute transport in kidney and intestine."

Like 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), isotachysterol(3) stimulates intestinal calcium transport and bone calcium mobilization in anephric rats, whereas 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) does not. Although isovitamin D(3) is biologically active in normal rats it is inactive in anephric rats."
https://openalex.org/W1546837933,"Abstract The rates of binding and dissociation of CO and hybrid-heme hemoglobins, in which one chain contains protoheme and the other chain meso- or deuteroheme, were measured at each heme site independently of changes at the partner chain site. The rates were also determined on isolated chains. The binding reaction of CO to hybrid-heme hemoglobins follows an autocatalytic process characteristic of a heme-heme interaction, and the initial and final values of the apparent second order rate constants of this reaction were obtained. The rate constant of the dissociation of the CO molecule from saturated hemoglobins was also estimated by the NO replacement method. All of these rate constants were compared with those determined for isolated chains containing the corresponding heme. For isolated chains, the rate of CO binding to β chains is usually larger than that to α chains containing the same heme, and the rate of CO dissociation from β chains is slower than that from the corresponding α chains. In hybrid-heme hemoglobins, when the rates were compared with those of corresponding isolated chains, CO binding to the β chains was slowed down more than that to the α chains. Moreover, the rate of CO dissociation from β chains was increased, while that from α chains was decreased. It was suggested that a conformational change occurs upon formation of a tetramer molecule (composed of α and β chains) which changes β chains from a more accessible state to the CO molecule than α chains to a less accessible state with respect to both the binding and dissociation processes."

https://openalex.org/W2051404771,The consequences of a zero population growth policy on the racial characteristics of the resulting population group are projected from different alternative fertility and mortality trends of the white and nonwhite population segments without interaction between them. Short-run and intermediate influences including migration are not considered concentrating on a long-term gross prediction. Models for the projection used the year 1965 as a baseline and the statistical calculations are described. Projections were calculated for zero population growth beginning in 1965 1980 and at 20-year intervals thereafter to 2040. The results of this model predict first a large population increase in both racial segments before stabilization due to the large proportion of young people in the initial sample and declining mortality rates. The later zero population growth is started the sooner the peak population is reached and the higher the percentage of nonwhites are in the final population. Yet even under the most optimum combination of demographic habits for nonwhite reproduction the highest proportion reached by that segment is only 30%. The genocide hypothesis that population control will lead to nonwhite extinction is not supported by any evidence. It is concluded that the population growth problem is one of expanding the distribution of social amenities to all segments of society rather than a unidimensional problem of limiting population numbers. However if population size becomes a determining factor in socioeconomic equality the issues of compulsory fertility control must be confronted.
