https://openalex.org/W2079897458,"The unified global efforts to mitigate the high burden of vitamin and mineral deficiency, known as hidden hunger, in populations around the world are crucial to the achievement of most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We developed indices and maps of global hidden hunger to help prioritize program assistance, and to serve as an evidence-based global advocacy tool. Two types of hidden hunger indices and maps were created based on i) national prevalence data on stunting, anemia due to iron deficiency, and low serum retinol levels among preschool-aged children in 149 countries; and ii) estimates of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributed to micronutrient deficiencies in 136 countries. A number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India and Afghanistan, had an alarmingly high level of hidden hunger, with stunting, iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin A deficiency all being highly prevalent. The total DALY rates per 100,000 population, attributed to micronutrient deficiencies, were generally the highest in sub-Saharan African countries. In 36 countries, home to 90% of the world’s stunted children, deficiencies of micronutrients were responsible for 1.5-12% of the total DALYs. The pattern and magnitude of iodine deficiency did not conform to that of other micronutrients. The greatest proportions of children with iodine deficiency were in the Eastern Mediterranean (46.6%), European (44.2%), and African (40.4%) regions. The current indices and maps provide crucial data to optimize the prioritization of program assistance addressing global multiple micronutrient deficiencies. Moreover, the indices and maps serve as a useful advocacy tool in the call for increased commitments to scale up effective nutrition interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1975054518,"Marine ecosystems are undergoing substantial changes due to human-induced pressures. Analysis of long-term data series is a valuable tool for understanding naturally and anthropogenically induced changes in plankton communities. In the present study, seasonal monitoring data were collected in three sub-basins of the northern Baltic Sea between 1979 and 2011 and statistically analysed for trends and interactions between surface water hydrography, inorganic nutrient concentrations and phyto- and zooplankton community composition. The most conspicuous hydrographic change was a significant increase in late summer surface water temperatures over the study period. In addition, salinity decreased and dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations increased in some basins. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), warming was the key environmental factor explaining the observed changes in plankton communities: the general increase in total phytoplankton biomass, Cyanophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae and Chrysophyceae, and decrease in Cryptophyceae throughout the study area, as well as increase in rotifers and decrease in total zooplankton, cladoceran and copepod abundances in some basins. We conclude that the plankton communities in the Baltic Sea have shifted towards a food web structure with smaller sized organisms, leading to decreased energy available for grazing zooplankton and planktivorous fish. The shift is most probably due to complex interactions between warming, eutrophication and increased top-down pressure due to overexploitation of resources, and the resulting trophic cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1997682935,"The main objective of this study was to examine the association between male partner involvement and the uptake of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) interventions.A retrospective cohort study was used to collect data on women, their male partners and their children who were enrolled in a PMTCT program from January 2004 to December 2006 at Mwanza District Hospital. HIV infected women and their children were followed-up over the 18 months postnatal period. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test and logistic regression.A total of 476 HIV positive women were enrolled in a PMTCT program and were followed-up in the study. Of those followed-up in the study, 65 (13.7%) had a male partner involvement while 411 (86.3%) had no male partner involvement. Male partner involvement was significantly associated with condom use (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3-13.5, P<0.001), hospital delivery (AOR = 25.9, 95%CI: 10.6-63.6, P<0.001), and completion of follow-up in the program (AOR = 16.8, 95% CI: 8.5-33.4, P<0.001).Male partner involvement increases the uptake of some PMTCT interventions by HIV positive women. Multi-strategic, culturally tailored public health care models are needed to increase the rate of male partner involvement in the program."
https://openalex.org/W2031821034,"Background The number of visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) in England has increased by 20% since 2007-08, placing unsustainable pressure on the National Health Service (NHS). Some patients attend EDs because they are unable to access primary care services. This study examined the association between access to primary care and ED visits in England. Methods A cross-sectional, population-based analysis of patients registered with 7,856 general practices in England was conducted, for the time period April 2010 to March 2011. The outcome measure was the number of self-referred discharged ED visits by the registered population of a general practice. The predictor variables were measures of patient-reported access to general practice services; these were entered into a negative binomial regression model with variables to control for the characteristics of patient populations, supply of general practitioners and travel times to health services. Main Result and Conclusion General practices providing more timely access to primary care had fewer self-referred discharged ED visits per registered patient (for the most accessible quintile of practices, RR = 0.898; P<0.001). Policy makers should consider improving timely access to primary care when developing plans to reduce ED utilisation."
https://openalex.org/W1971831531,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a highly conserved physiological program involved in development and tissue repair; however, its aberrant activation has been implicated in accelerating the progression of a variety of cancers. In breast cancer, the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-221 and miR-222 (miR-221/222) are differentially expressed in the clinically more aggressive basal-like subtype compared to luminal subtype of breast cancer and upregulation of miR-221/222 induces the EMT by targeting the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the GATA family transcriptional repressor TRPS1 (tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome type 1). The complete mechanism through which miR-221/222 promotes the EMT, however, is not fully understood. We identified adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1), a receptor for the adipocytokine adiponectin, as a direct target of miR-221/222. ADIPOR1 is expressed at higher levels in the luminal compared to the basal-like subtype of breast cancer cell lines, which can be reduced by miR-221/222 targeting of its 3'UTR. In addition, miR-221/222 were negatively correlated with ADIPOR1 expression across breast cancer cell lines and tumors. ADIPOR1 depletion by siRNA in MCF10A cells induced the EMT and increased cell invasion. Depletion of ADIPOR1 by siRNA induced activation of the canonical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and subsequent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in an interleukin 6 (IL6)-dependent manner. Finally, overexpression of ADIPOR1 in the basal-like cell line, MDA-MB-231, attenuated cell invasion and promoted the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). We conclude that ADIPOR1 negatively regulates EMT in breast cancer and provides an additional node by which miR-221/222 induces the EMT. These results suggest that ADIPOR1 may play an important role in breast cancer progression and metastasis, and could potentially offer an alternative therapeutic strategy for basal-like breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2056736512,"A wide body of evidence suggests that 5-HT7 receptors are implicated in a variety of central nervous system functions, including control of learning and memory processes. According to recent preclinical data, the selective blockade of these receptors may be a potential target for cognitive improvement in schizophrenia. The first aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, SB-269970, and the antipsychotic drug with a high affinity for 5-HT7 receptors, amisulpride, on ketamine-induced deficits in attentional set-shifting and novel object recognition tasks in rats. Because the role of 5-HT7 receptor blockade in ameliorating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia remains equivocal, the second aim of these experiments was to examine the effectiveness of SB-269970 and amisulpride in reversing ketamine-induced deficits in prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex and in social interaction test in rats. The study revealed that acute administration of SB-269970 (1 mg/kg) or amisulpride (3 mg/kg) ameliorated ketamine-induced cognitive inflexibility and novel object recognition deficit in rats. Both compounds were also effective in attenuating ketamine-evoked disruption of social interactions. In contrast, neither SB-269970 nor amisulpride affected ketamine-disrupted prepulse inhibition or 50 kHz USVs accompanying social behaviour. In conclusion, antagonism of 5-HT7 receptors may represent a useful pharmacological approach in the treatment of cognitive deficits and some negative symptoms of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2028283504,"Accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in joints is important in the development of cartilage destruction and damage in age-related osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and receptor for AGEs (RAGE) in AGEs-induced inflammatory signalings in human OA chondrocytes. Human articular chondrocytes were isolated and cultured. The productions of metalloproteinase-13 and interleukin-6 were quantified using the specific ELISA kits. The expressions of related signaling proteins were determined by Western blotting. Our results showed that AGEs enhanced the productions of interleukin-6 and metalloproteinase-13 and the expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 and high-mobility group protein B1 and resulted in the reduction of collagen II expression in human OA chondrocytes. AGEs could also activate nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation. Stimulation of human OA chondrocytes with AGEs significantly induced the up-regulation of TLR4 and RAGE expressions and the down-regulation of PPARγ expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Neutralizing antibodies of TLR4 and RAGE effectively reversed the AGEs-induced inflammatory signalings and PPARγ down-regulation. PPARγ agonist pioglitazone could also reverse the AGEs-increased inflammatory signalings. Specific inhibitors for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and NF-κB suppressed AGEs-induced PPARγ down-regulation and reduction of collagen II expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that AGEs induce PPARγ down-regulation-mediated inflammatory signalings and reduction of collagen II expression in human OA chondrocytes via TLR4 and RAGE, which may play a crucial role in the development of osteoarthritis pathogenesis induced by AGEs accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2005985629,"Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) has been implicated in the progression of diabetic keratopathy. However, details regarding their function are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and JNK, p38 MAPK on AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) induced Human telomerase-immortalized corneal epithelial cells (HUCLs) apoptosis. We found that AGE-BSA induced HUCLs apoptosis and increased Bax protein expression, decreased Bcl-2 protein expression. AGE-BSA also induced the expression of receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE). AGE-BSA-RAGE interaction induced intracellular ROS generation through activated NADPH oxidase and increased the phosphorylation of p47phox. AGE-BSA induced HUCLs apoptosis was inhibited by pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitors, ROS quencher N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or neutralizing anti-RAGE antibodies. We also found that AGE-BSA induced JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitor effectively blocked AGE-BSA-induced HUCLs apoptosis. In addition, NAC completely blocked phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK induced by AGE-BSA. Our results indicate that AGE-BSA induced HUCLs apoptosis through generation of intracellular ROS and activation of JNK and p38 MAPK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2108274478,"The emergence of high-throughput, next-generation sequencing technologies has dramatically altered the way we assess genomes in population genetics and in cancer genomics. Currently, there are four commonly used whole-genome sequencing platforms on the market: Illumina’s HiSeq2000, Life Technologies’ SOLiD 4 and its completely redesigned 5500xl SOLiD, and Complete Genomics’ technology. A number of earlier studies have compared a subset of those sequencing platforms or compared those platforms with Sanger sequencing, which is prohibitively expensive for whole genome studies. Here we present a detailed comparison of the performance of all currently available whole genome sequencing platforms, especially regarding their ability to call SNVs and to evenly cover the genome and specific genomic regions. Unlike earlier studies, we base our comparison on four different samples, allowing us to assess the between-sample variation of the platforms. We find a pronounced GC bias in GC-rich regions for Life Technologies’ platforms, with Complete Genomics performing best here, while we see the least bias in GC-poor regions for HiSeq2000 and 5500xl. HiSeq2000 gives the most uniform coverage and displays the least sample-to-sample variation. In contrast, Complete Genomics exhibits by far the smallest fraction of bases not covered, while the SOLiD platforms reveal remarkable shortcomings, especially in covering CpG islands. When comparing the performance of the four platforms for calling SNPs, HiSeq2000 and Complete Genomics achieve the highest sensitivity, while the SOLiD platforms show the lowest false positive rate. Finally, we find that integrating sequencing data from different platforms offers the potential to combine the strengths of different technologies. In summary, our results detail the strengths and weaknesses of all four whole-genome sequencing platforms. It indicates application areas that call for a specific sequencing platform and disallow other platforms. This helps to identify the proper sequencing platform for whole genome studies with different application scopes."
https://openalex.org/W2108725123,"Objective To determine if serum amyloid A (A-SAA) could be detected in human osteoarthritic (OA) joints and further clarify if high A-SAA level in joints result from a local production or from a diffusion process from abnormally elevated plasma concentration. Regulatory mechanism of A-SAA expression and its pro-inflammatory properties were also investigated. Methods A-SAA levels in serum and synovial fluid of OA (n = 29) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 27) patients were measured and compared to matched-healthy volunteers (HV) (n = 35). In vitro cell cultures were performed on primary joint cells provided from osteoarthritis patients. Regulatory mechanisms were studied using Western-blotting, ELISA and lentiviral transfections. Results A-SAA was statistically increased in OA plasma patients compared to HV. Moreover, A-SAA level in OA plasma and synovial fluid increased with the Kellgren & Lauwrence grade. For all OA and RA patients, A-SAA plasma level was higher and highly correlated with its corresponding level in the synovial fluid, therefore supporting that A-SAA was mainly due to the passive diffusion process from blood into the joint cavity. However, A-SAA expression was also observed in vitro under corticosteroid treatment and/or under IL-1beta stimuli. A-SAA expression was down-regulated by PPAR-γ agonists (genistein and rosiglitazone) and up-regulated by TGF-β1 through Alk1 (Smad1/5) pathway. RhSAA induced proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, GRO-α and MCP-1) and metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13) expression in FLS and chondrocytes, which expression was downregulated by TAK242, a specific TLR4 inhibitor. Conclusion Systemic or local A-SAA expression inside OA joint cavity may play a key role in inflammatory process seen in osteoarthritis, which could be counteracted by TLR4 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2144099077,"Treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) by replacing mutant dystrophin or restoring dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAG) has been clinically challenging. Instead, identifying and targeting muscle pathways deregulated in DMD will provide new therapeutic avenues. We report that the expression of nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor-γ (ERRγ), and its metabolic and angiogenic targets are down-regulated (50-85%) in skeletal muscles of mdx mice (DMD model) vs. wild-type mice. Corelatively, oxidative myofibers, muscle vasculature, and exercise tolerance (33%) are decreased in mdx vs. wild-type mice. Overexpressing ERRγ selectively in the dystrophic muscles of the mdx mice restored metabolic and angiogenic gene expression compared with control mdx mice. Further, ERRγ enhanced muscle oxidative myofibers, vasculature, and blood flow (by 33-66%) and improved exercise tolerance (by 75%) in the dystrophic mice. Restoring muscle ERRγ pathway ameliorated muscle damage and also prevented DMD hallmarks of postexercise muscle damage, hypoxia, and fatigue in mdx mice. Notably, ERRγ did not restore sarcolemmal DAG complex, which is thus dispensable for antidystrophic effects of ERRγ. In summary, ERRγ-dependent metabolic and angiogenic gene program is defective in DMD, and we demonstrate that its restoration is a potential strategy for treating muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2072205597,"Alternative splicing plays a major role in expanding the potential informational content of eukaryotic genomes. It is an important post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that can increase protein diversity and affect mRNA stability. Alternative splicing is often regulated in a tissue-specific and stress-responsive manner. Cold stress, which adversely affects plant growth and development, regulates the transcription and splicing of plant splicing factors. This can affect the pre-mRNA processing of many genes. To identify cold regulated alternative splicing we applied Affymetrix Arabidopsis tiling arrays to survey the transcriptome under cold treatment conditions. A novel algorithm was used for detection of statistically relevant changes in intron expression within a transcript between control and cold growth conditions. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of a number of randomly selected genes confirmed the changes in splicing patterns under cold stress predicted by tiling array. Our analysis revealed new types of cold responsive genes. While their expression level remains relatively unchanged under cold stress their splicing pattern shows detectable changes in the relative abundance of isoforms. The majority of cold regulated alternative splicing introduced a premature termination codon (PTC) into the transcripts creating potential targets for degradation by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) process. A number of these genes were analyzed in NMD-defective mutants by RT-PCR and shown to evade NMD. This may result in new and truncated proteins with altered functions or dominant negative effects. The results indicate that cold affects both quantitative and qualitative aspects of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2093331924,"Recent studies suggest that action video game players exhibit superior performance in visuospatial cognitive tasks compared with non-game players. However, the neural basis underlying this visuospatial cognitive performance advantage remains largely unknown. The present human behavioral and imaging study compared gray matter volume in action video game experts and non-experts using structural magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry analysis. The results revealed significantly larger gray matter volume in the right posterior parietal cortex in experts compared with non-experts. Furthermore, the larger gray matter volume in the right posterior parietal cortex significantly correlated with individual performance in a visual working memory task in experts. These results suggest that differences in brain structure may be linked to extensive video game play, leading to superior visuospatial cognitive performance in action video game experts."
https://openalex.org/W1971600343,"Naturally transformable bacteria recombine internalized ssDNA with a homologous resident duplex (chromosomal transformation) or complementary internalized ssDNAs (plasmid or viral transformation). Bacillus subtilis competence-induced DprA, RecA, SsbB, and SsbA proteins are involved in the early processing of the internalized ssDNA, with DprA physically interacting with RecA. SsbB and SsbA bind and melt secondary structures in ssDNA but limit RecA loading onto ssDNA. DprA binds to ssDNA and facilitates partial dislodging of both single-stranded binding (SSB) proteins from ssDNA. In the absence of homologous duplex DNA, DprA does not significantly increase RecA nucleation onto protein-free ssDNA. DprA facilitates RecA nucleation and filament extension onto SsbB-coated or SsbB plus SsbA-coated ssDNA. DprA facilitates RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange in the presence of both SSB proteins. DprA, which plays a crucial role in plasmid transformation, anneals complementary strands preferentially coated by SsbB to form duplex circular plasmid molecules. Our results provide a mechanistic framework for conceptualizing the coordinated events modulated by SsbB in concert with SsbA and DprA that are crucial for RecA-dependent chromosomal transformation and RecA-independent plasmid transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2034061233,"Ascorbic acid (AA) exhibits significant anticancer activity at pharmacologic doses achievable by parenteral administration that have minimal effects on normal cells. Thus, AA has potential uses as a chemotherapeutic agent alone or in combination with other therapeutics that specifically target cancer-cell metabolism. We compared the effects of AA and combinations of AA with the glycolysis inhibitor 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3-PO) on the viability of three non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to the effects on an immortalized lung epithelial cell line. AA concentrations of 0.5 to 5 mM caused a complete loss of viability in all NSCLC lines compared to a <10% loss of viability in the lung epithelial cell line. Combinations of AA and 3-PO synergistically enhanced cell death in all NSCLC cell lines at concentrations well below the IC50 concentrations for each compound alone. A synergistic interaction was not observed in combination treatments of lung epithelial cells and combination treatments that caused a complete loss of viability in NSCLC cells had modest effects on normal lung cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Combination treatments induced dramatically higher ROS levels compared to treatment with AA and 3-PO alone in NSCLC cells and combination-induced cell death was inhibited by addition of catalase to the medium. Analyses of DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, annexin V-binding, and caspase activity demonstrated that AA-induced cell death is caused via the activation of apoptosis and that the combination treatments caused a synergistic induction of apoptosis. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AA against NSCLC cells and that combinations of AA with 3-PO synergistically induce apoptosis via a ROS-dependent mechanism. These results support further evaluation of pharmacologic concentrations of AA as an adjuvant treatment for NSCLC and that combination of AA with glycolysis inhibitors may be a promising therapy for the treatment of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W1964291200,"We investigated whether obesity, physical activity, and calorie intake are associated with the risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer.We enrolled 1125 women (age, 18-65 years) into a human papillomavirus cohort study established from 2006 to 2012. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate crude and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and to assess whether body mass index (BMI), height, weight, total calorie intake, and physical activity were associated with the risks of CIN and cervical cancer.Cervical cancer risk was positively associated with BMI and inversely associated with physical activity. When compared with women with a normal BMI (18.5-23 kg/m(2)), the multivariate ORs (95% CIs) for those overweight (23-25 kg/m(2)) and mild obesity (≥25 kg/m(2)) were 1.25 (0.79-2.00) and 1.70 (1.10-2.63), respectively. When compared with women with the lowest tertile of physical activity (<38.5 MET-hours/week), the ORs (95% CIs) for cervical cancer were 0.95 (0.61-1.48) and 0.61 (0.38-0.98) for women with medium physical activity (38.5-71.9 MET-hours/week) and those with high physical activity (72 MET-hours/week), respectively (p for linear trend = 0.03). The CIN2/3 risk was inversely associated with physical activity after adjustment for confounders. Compared with women with low physical activity (< 38.5 MET-hours/week), the ORs (95% CIs) for CIN2/3 were 0.64 (0.40-1.01) and 0.58 (0.36-0.93) for the medium and high physical activity groups, respectively (p for linear trend = 0.02). Total calorie intake was not statistically associated with the risks of CIN and cervical cancer after adjustment for confounders.Our results indicate that in addition to screening for and treatment of CIN, recommendations on the maintenance of an appropriate BMI with an emphasis on physical activity could be an important preventive strategy against the development of cervical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2012256658,"CD73 (ecto-5’-nucleotidase) is a cell surface enzyme that regulates purinergic signalling by desphosphorylating extracellular AMP to adenosine. 5′-nucleotidases are known to be expressed in brain, but the expression of CD73 and its putative physiological functions at this location remain elusive. Here we found, using immunohistochemistry of wild-type and CD73 deficient mice, that CD73 is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia core comprised of striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and globus pallidus. Furthermore, meninges and the olfactory tubercle were found to specifically express CD73. Analysis of wild type (wt) and CD73 deficient mice revealed that CD73 confers the majority of 5’-nucleotidase activity in several areas of the brain. In a battery of behavioural tests and in IntelliCage studies, the CD73 deficient mice demonstrated significantly enhanced exploratory locomotor activity, which probably reflects the prominent expression of CD73 in striatum and globus pallidus that are known to control locomotion. Furthermore, the CD73 deficient mice displayed altered social behaviour. Overall, our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into adenosinergic signalling in brain, which is implicated in the regulation of normal and pathological behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2074292619,"Defects in N-glycosylation and N-glycan processing frequently cause alterations in plant cell wall architecture, including changes in the structure of cellulose, which is the most abundant plant polysaccharide. KORRIGAN1 (KOR1) is a glycoprotein enzyme with an essential function during cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. KOR1 is a membrane-anchored endo-β1,4-glucanase and contains eight potential N-glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain. Here, we expressed A. thaliana KOR1 as a soluble, enzymatically active protein in insect cells and analyzed its N-glycosylation state. Structural analysis revealed that all eight potential N-glycosylation sites are utilized. Individual elimination of evolutionarily conserved N-glycosylation sites did not abolish proper KOR1 folding, but mutations of Asn-216, Asn-324, Asn-345, and Asn-567 resulted in considerably lower enzymatic activity. In contrast, production of wild-type KOR1 in the presence of the class I α-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine, which abolished the conversion of KOR1 N-glycans into complex structures, did not affect the activity of the enzyme. To address N-glycosylation site occupancy and N-glycan composition of KOR1 under more natural conditions, we expressed a chimeric KOR1-Fc-GFP fusion protein in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. Although Asn-108 and Asn-133 carried oligomannosidic N-linked oligosaccharides, the six other glycosylation sites were modified with complex N-glycans. Interestingly, the partially functional KOR1 G429R mutant encoded by the A. thaliana rsw2-1 allele displayed only oligomannosidic structures when expressed in N. benthamiana, indicating its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. In summary, our data indicate that utilization of several N-glycosylation sites is important for KOR1 activity, whereas the structure of the attached N-glycans is not critical."
https://openalex.org/W2141413828,"The exopolysaccharide alginate, produced by mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, undergoes two different chemical modifications as it is synthesized that alter the properties of the polymer and hence the biofilm. One modification, acetylation, causes the cells in the biofilm to adhere better to lung epithelium, form microcolonies, and resist the effects of the host immune system and/or antibiotics. Alginate biosynthesis requires 12 proteins encoded by the algD operon, including AlgX, and although this protein is essential for polymer production, its exact role is unknown. In this study, we present the X-ray crystal structure of AlgX at 2.15 Å resolution. The structure reveals that AlgX is a two-domain protein, with an N-terminal domain with structural homology to members of the SGNH hydrolase superfamily and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module. A number of residues in the carbohydrate-binding module form a substrate recognition ""pinch point"" that we propose aids in alginate binding and orientation. Although the topology of the N-terminal domain deviates from canonical SGNH hydrolases, the residues that constitute the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad characteristic of this family are structurally conserved. In vivo studies reveal that site-specific mutation of these residues results in non-acetylated alginate. This catalytic triad is also required for acetylesterase activity in vitro. Our data suggest that not only does AlgX protect the polymer as it passages through the periplasm but that it also plays a role in alginate acetylation. Our results provide the first structural insight for a wide group of closely related bacterial polysaccharide acetyltransferases."

https://openalex.org/W1999472620,"Extracellular short fibulins, fibulin-3, -4, and -5, are components of the elastic fiber/microfibril system and are implicated in the formation and homeostasis of elastic tissues. In this study, we report new structural and functional properties of the short fibulins. Full-length human short fibulins were recombinantly expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. All three fibulins showed various levels of degradation after the purification procedure. N-terminal sequencing revealed that all three fibulins are highly susceptible to proteolysis within the N-terminal linker region of the first calcium-binding epidermal growth factor domain. Proteolytic susceptibility of the linker correlated with its length. Exposure of these fibulins to matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, and -12 resulted in similar proteolytic fragments with MMP-7 and -12 being the most potent proteases. Fibulin-3 proteolysis was almost completely inhibited in cell culture by the addition of 25 μm doxycycline (a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor). Reducible fibulin-4 dimerization and multimerization were consistently observed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy identified monomers, dimers, and multimers in purified fibulin-4 preparations with sizes of ∼10–15, ∼20–25, and ∼30–50 nm, respectively. All short fibulins strongly adhered to human fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Although only fibulin-5 has an RGD integrin binding site, all short fibulins adhere at a similar level to the respective cells. Solid phase binding assays detected strong calcium-dependent binding of the short fibulins to immobilized heparin, suggesting that these fibulins may bind cell surface-located heparan sulfate.Background: Fibulin-3, -4, and -5 (short fibulins) participate in elastogenesis, although the molecular mechanism remains unknown.Results: Short fibulins are cleaved by MMPs and bind cells and heparin, and fibulin-4 dimerizes and multimerizes.Conclusion: Short fibulins have a proteolytically susceptible linker and can bind cells independently of the RGD motif, and fibulin-4 multimerization is crucial for heparin binding.Significance: The uncovered properties will advance understanding of elastogenesis.

Solid phase binding assays detected strong calcium-dependent binding of the short fibulins to immobilized heparin, suggesting that these fibulins may bind cell surface-located heparan sulfate. Background: Fibulin-3, -4, and -5 (short fibulins) participate in elastogenesis, although the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Results: Short fibulins are cleaved by MMPs and bind cells and heparin, and fibulin-4 dimerizes and multimerizes. Conclusion: Short fibulins have a proteolytically susceptible linker and can bind cells independently of the RGD motif, and fibulin-4 multimerization is crucial for heparin binding. Significance: The uncovered properties will advance understanding of elastogenesis. The fibulin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins comprises eight members, fibulin-1 through -8 (for a review, see Ref. 1.Cooley M.A. Argraves W.S. Mecham R.P. Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Springer, New York2011: 337-359Google Scholar). Fibulin-3, -4, and -5 are collectively referred to as the short fibulins, sharing a similar domain structure with calculated molecular masses of 52–56 kDa. The short fibulins are each composed of six tandem calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) 2The abbreviations used are: cbEGF, calcium-binding epidermal growth factor; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; DOX, doxycycline; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; RGD, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid; RGE, arginine-glycine-glutamic acid; TBS/Ca, CaCl2-containing Tris-buffered saline; AFM, atomic force microscopy. domains followed by a fibulin-type C terminus (see Fig. 1A) (2.Lecka-Czernik B.

Characteristic for the short fibulins is an insertion of amino acid residues between the fourth and fifth cysteines known as the N-terminal linker region (5.Kobayashi N. Kostka G. Garbe J.H.

This insert of unknown function varies in size among human fibulin-3, -4, and -5 with 88, 28, and 44 amino acid residues, respectively. Fibulin-3 contains one and fibulin-4 and -5 contain two conserved sequons for N-linked glycosylation. Only fibulin-5 contains a conserved integrin-binding RGD sequence in its first cbEGF domain preceding the insert, whereas fibulin-3 and -4 are devoid of RGD sequences (5.Kobayashi N. Kostka G.

Overlapping and distinct tissue expression patterns have been described for the short fibulins. Fibulin-3 is expressed in diverse tissues, including cartilage, bone, subretinal pigment epithelium, skin, and capillaries. Fibulin-4 and -5 are expressed in blood vessels, lung, skin, and cartilage with fibulin-5 being additionally expressed in the uterus and Bruch membrane (for a review, see Ref. 7.de Vega S. Iwamoto T. Yamada Y. Fibulins: multiple roles in matrix structures and tissue functions.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 1890-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The importance of the short fibulins in elastic fiber formation and homeostasis became apparent through the generation of knock-out mouse models, which demonstrated various degrees of elastic fiber malformation. Although fibulin-3-null mice survive until adulthood, they exhibit reduced bone density and reproductivity as well as premature aging, inguinal herniation, and uterine and rectal prolapse (8.McLaughlin P.J. Bakall B. Choi J. Liu Z. Sasaki T. Davis E.C. Marmorstein A.D. Marmorstein L.Y. Lack of fibulin-3 causes early aging and herniation, but not macular degeneration in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 3059-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The herniation and prolapse are likely explained by the observed reduced elastic fibers in the fascia of the fibulin-3-deficient mice. In contrast, human mutations in fibulin-3 have been associated with Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy (9.Stone E.M. Lotery A.J. Munier F.L. Héon E. Piguet B. Guymer R.H. Vandenburgh K. Cousin P.

The fibulin-4-null mouse has the most severe phenotype of the short fibulin knock-out mice with perinatal death caused by aortic rupture, emphysematous lung, and aortic aneurysm as well as arterial tortuosity, narrowing, and dilatation (10.McLaughlin P.J.

Targeted disruption of fibulin-4 abolishes elastogenesis and causes perinatal lethality in mice.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1700-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Only small aggregates of amorphous elastin instead of fully developed elastic fibers are present in the skin, lung, and blood vessels. In humans, fibulin-4 mutations give rise to cutis laxa characterized by inelastic and saggy skin, vascular tortuosity, increased risk of ascending aortic aneurysms, emphysema, and other clinical symptoms (11.Hucthagowder V.

The fibulin-5-null mouse survives until adulthood with thin and fragmented elastic fibers in the ascending aorta, lung, and skin; tortuosity and elongation of the aorta; severe emphysema; loose and inelastic skin; and pelvic organ prolapse during pregnancy (12.Nakamura T.

It has been shown that mouse fibulin-3 and human fibulin-4 and -5 interact with tropoelastin (5.Kobayashi N. Kostka G. Garbe J.H. Keene D.R. Bächinger H.P. Hanisch F.G. Markova D. Tsuda T. Timpl R.

Of the short fibulins, fibulin-5 cell attachment properties have been explored and attributed to the presence of an RGD site. Specifically, fibulin-5 has been demonstrated to bind human umbilical vein endothelial cells in an RGD-dependent manner; Chinese hamster ovary cells via integrins α9β1, αvβ3, and αvβ5; and primary human aortic smooth muscle cells via integrins α5β1 and α4β1 (4.Nakamura T.

J. 2007; 405: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A mouse knock-in model replacing the RGD with inactive RGE in fibulin-5 forms normal elastic fibers, demonstrating that the RGD cell interaction site is dispensable for elastogenesis (18.Budatha M. Roshanravan S. Zheng Q. Weislander C. Chapman S.L. Davis E.C. Starcher B. Word R.A. Yanagisawa H. Extracellular matrix proteases contribute to progression of pelvic organ prolapse in mice and humans.J. Clin. Investig. 2011; 121: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is currently not known whether fibulin-5 and the other short fibulins that do not possess an RGD site can interact with cells through RGD-independent mechanisms. Proteolytic cleavage of fibulin-5 has been reported in its N-terminal linker region in aged mice (19.Hirai M. Ohbayashi T. Horiguchi M. Okawa K. Hagiwara A. Chien K.R. Kita T. Nakamura T. Fibulin-5/DANCE has an elastogenic organizer activity that is abrogated by proteolytic cleavage in vivo.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 1061-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The resulting fibulin-5 fragment is no longer able to participate in elastogenesis, suggesting that fibulin-5 cleavage may be involved in the aging of elastic tissues. Whether or not fibulin-3 and -4 are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in the N-terminal linker region remains to be elucidated. One of the goals of the present study was to explore the susceptibility of the short fibulins to proteolytic degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The MMP family comprises 23 proteases, either membrane-bound or secreted into the extracellular matrix where they are able to degrade many extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, elastin, fibronectin, and fibrillin (20.Sekhon B.S.

This family of endopeptidases is characterized by a Zn2+ ion in the active site of the catalytic domain. MMP-3, -7, -9, and -12 are elastin-degrading enzymes (23.Visse R. Nagase H.

Because of the relatively mild elastogenic phenotype of the fibulin-3-null mouse and the involvement of the protein in retinal dystrophy in humans, the role of fibulin-3 in elastogenesis has been poorly studied to date. Based on in vitro binding experiments and in vivo mouse and human data, fibulin-4 and -5 have recently been incorporated into a working model of elastogenesis. Fibulin-4 is hypothesized to bring tropoelastin and pro-lysyl oxidase in close proximity to facilitate initial cross-linking within the coacervate (28.Horiguchi M. Inoue T. Ohbayashi T. Hirai M. Noda K. Marmorstein L.Y. Yabe D. Takagi K. Akama T.O. Kita T. Kimura T. Nakamura T. Fibulin-4 conducts proper elastogenesis via interaction with cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19029-19034Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fibulin-5 is presumed to then bind the partially cross-linked tropoelastin coacervate and direct it to the microfibril for further cross-linking and incorporation into the mature elastic fiber (12.Nakamura T.

This study aimed to advance the understanding of the characteristics of the short fibulins with a focus on proteolysis and cell attachment. Human short fibulins were recombinantly expressed and purified, and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that all three proteins were N-glycosylated and partially cleaved in the N-terminal linker region. MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, and -12 cleaved the short fibulins to fragments almost identical in size and cleavage sites to the fragments obtained upon purification. The short fibulins bound human fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells possibly through heparan sulfate-containing cell surface receptors as all three proteins bound heparin. Furthermore, fibulin-4 monomers, dimers, and multimers were observed by atomic force microscopy, and monomers were separated from multimers by gel filtration chromatography. In contrast to the fibulin-4 monomers and dimers, the multimers strongly bound heparin, suggesting that multimerization may be required for fibulin-4 cell attachment. All chemicals used were of the highest purity and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich if not otherwise stated. Polyclonal antisera were produced against fibulin-3, -4, and -5 in rabbit following standard procedures using recombinant full-length proteins as antigen. The specificity and cross-reactivity of each antiserum was verified by Western blotting and ELISA with recombinant short fibulins. The polyclonal antiserum against the C-terminal half of human fibrillin-1 was generated and characterized previously (30.Lin G. Tiedemann K. Vollbrandt T. Peters H. Batge B. Brinckmann J.

The monoclonal primary antibodies against human fibronectin (Sigma, product F7387) and against a C-terminal polyhistidine sequence (anti-His(C-term), Invitrogen, product R93025) were commercially purchased. The secondary antibody used to detect all polyclonal primary antibodies was goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, product 111-035-003). Conversely, the secondary antibody used to detect all monoclonal primary antibodies was goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, product 115-035-062). All primary antibodies were diluted 1:500 for Western blotting and 1:1000 for solid phase and ELISA assays, whereas secondary antibodies were always diluted 1:800. Full-length human fibulin-3, -4, and -5 constructs were generated using the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, product V79020), which included the sequence for an N-terminal BM-40 signal peptide for efficient secretion from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and was thus named pDNSP (30.Lin G.

A C-terminal hexahistidine tag sequence was included to allow for protein purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Full-length short fibulin cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA isolated from human skin fibroblasts (described below). The expression plasmid for Gln18–Phe493 of human fibulin-3 was generated by subcloning the NheI-XhoI-restricted 1459-bp polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product generated with oligonucleotides 5′-CAGGCTAGCACAGGACACCGAAGAAACCATC-3′ and 5′-TAACTCGAGCTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAAATGAAAATGGCCCCACTATTATTG-3′ into the NheI-XhoI-linearized pDNSP plasmid, resulting in the pDNSP-hFBLN3 plasmid. The expressed protein was APLAQ18–F493HHHHHH.

The expressed protein was APLAQ28–F443HHHHHH. The expression plasmid for Gln24–Phe448 of human fibulin-5 was generated by subcloning the NheI-XhoI-restricted 1306-bp PCR product generated with oligonucleotides 5′-CAGGCTAGCACAGGCACAGTGCACGAATGG-3′ and 5′-TAACTCGAGCTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGAATGGGTACTGCGACACATATATC-3′ into the NheI-XhoI-linearized pDNSP plasmid, resulting in the pDNSP-hFBLN5 plasmid coding for APLAQ24–F448HHHHHH. The entire coding region of all expression plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmids pDNSP-hFBLN3, -4, and -5 were linearized with PvuI, ethanol-precipitated, and redissolved in water. 10 μg of DNA was used for transfection of HEK293 cells with calcium phosphate as described previously (30.Lin G. Tiedemann K. Vollbrandt T. Peters H. Batge B. Brinckmann J. Reinhardt D.P. Homo- and heterotypic fibrillin-1 and -2 interactions constitute the basis for the assembly of microfibrils.J. Biol.

The selection procedure was initiated 2 days after transfection with the addition of 750 μg/ml geneticin sulfate (G418; Wisent, product 450-130-QL) to the medium for 1 week and 250 μg/ml G418 thereafter. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Wisent, product 319-005) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Wisent, product 080150), 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (Wisent, product 450-202-EL). Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Recombinant protein secretion was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting following trichloroacetic acid precipitation of 1 ml of conditioned medium. Stably transfected HEK293 cells were plated on eight triple layer flasks (500-cm2 surface area; Nalge Nunc International, product 132913) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 250 μg/ml G418 to maintain clonal selection. Upon confluence, serum proteins were removed by two washes with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. All flasks were then placed on serum-free DMEM, and 500 ml of conditioned medium was collected every 48 h for a total of 10 collections. After each collection, cellular debris was removed from the conditioned medium by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was then added to prevent serine protease proteolysis of the collected material, and the collection was stored at −20 °C until protein purification. Treatment of stably transfected HEK293 cells with doxycycline (DOX; Sigma, product D9891) was attempted to inhibit MMPs to prevent proteolytic cleavage of the recombinant short fibulins. 25 μm DOX supplementation commenced when the cells were transferred onto eight triple layer flasks and was repeated with each collection of serum-free medium every 48 h. As a control, the transfected HEK293 cells on eight triple layer flasks were cultured without DOX. Human skin fibroblasts were extracted from foreskins of healthy boys (2–5 years of age) following a standard circumcision procedure. This procedure was approved by the Montreal Children's Hospital Research Ethics Committee (PED-06-054), and written consent of each patient's parents was obtained.

Subsequently rats were treated with vehicle alone or different dosages of fexofenadine (1.8 and 18 mg/kg) or ebastine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) and re-evaluated. Colonic tissue was collected to assess relative RMCP-2 and occludin expression levels by Western blot and histamine-1 receptor by RT-qPCR. β-hexosaminidase release by RBL-2H3 cells was used to establish possible mast cell stabilizing properties of the antagonists.Water avoidance only induced enhanced response to distension in maternally separated rats. This response was reversed by 1.8 and 18 mg/kg fexofenadine. Reversal was also obtained by 1.0 but not 0.1 mg/kg ebastine. RMCP-2 expression levels were comparable in these two ebastine treatment groups but occludin was significantly higher in 1.0 mg/kg treated rats. There were no differences in histamine-1 receptor expression between nonhandled and maternally separated rats. Fexofenadine but not ebastine showed mast cell stabilizing quality.Our results indicate that the peripherally restricted 2(nd) generation H1-receptor antagonists fexofenadine and ebastine are capable of reversing post stress visceral hypersensitivity in rat. These data justify future IBS patient trials with these well tolerated compounds.
https://openalex.org/W2066105460,"The development of structural defences, such as the fortification of shells or exoskeletons, is a widespread strategy to reduce predator attack efficiency. In unpredictable environments these defences may be more pronounced in the presence of a predator. The cladoceran Daphnia magna (Crustacea: Branchiopoda: Cladocera) has been shown to develop a bulky morphotype as an effective inducible morphological defence against the predatory tadpole shrimp Triops cancriformis (Crustacea: Branchiopoda: Notostraca). Mediated by kairomones, the daphnids express an increased body length, width and an elongated tail spine. Here we examined whether these large scale morphological defences are accompanied by additional ultrastructural defences, i.e. a fortification of the exoskeleton. We employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) based nanoindentation experiments to assess the cuticle hardness along with tapping mode AFM imaging to visualise the surface morphology for predator exposed and non-predator exposed daphnids. We used semi-thin sections of the carapace to measure the cuticle thickness, and finally, we used fluorescence microscopy to analyse the diameter of the pillars connecting the two carapace layers. We found that D. magna indeed expresses ultrastructural defences against Triops predation. The cuticle in predator exposed individuals is approximately five times harder and two times thicker than in control daphnids. Moreover, the pillar diameter is significantly increased in predator exposed daphnids. These predator-cue induced changes in the carapace architecture should provide effective protection against being crushed by the predator's mouthparts and may add to the protective effect of bulkiness. This study highlights the potential of interdisciplinary studies to uncover new and relevant aspects even in extensively studied fields of research."
https://openalex.org/W2086928551,"Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) from the erythrovirus genus is known to be a pathogenic virus in humans. Prevalence of B19V infection has been reported worldwide in all seasons, with a high incidence in the spring. B19V is responsible for erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) commonly seen in children. Its other clinical presentations include arthralgia, arthritis, transient aplastic crisis, chronic anemia, congenital anemia, and hydrops fetalis. In addition, B19V infection has been reported to trigger autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the mechanisms of B19V participation in autoimmunity are not fully understood. B19V induced chronic disease and persistent infection suggests B19V can serve as a model for viral host interactions and the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Here we investigate the involvement of B19V in the breakdown of immune tolerance. Previously, we demonstrated that the non-structural protein 1 (NS 1) of B19V induces apoptosis in non-permissive cells lines and that this protein can cleave host DNA as well as form NS1-DNA adducts. Here we provide evidence that through programmed cell death, apoptotic bodies (ApoBods) are generated by B19V NS1 expression in a non-permissive cell line. Characterization of purified ApoBods identified potential self-antigens within them. In particular, signature self-antigens such as Smith, ApoH, DNA, histone H4 and phosphatidylserine associated with autoimmunity were present in these ApoBods. In addition, when purified ApoBods were introduced to differentiated macrophages, recognition, engulfment and uptake occurred. This suggests that B19V can produce a source of self-antigens for immune cell processing. The results support our hypothesis that B19V NS1-DNA adducts, and nucleosomal and lysosomal antigens present in ApoBods created in non-permissive cell lines, are a source of self-antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1982680945,"ADAM proteases are implicated in multiple diseases, but no drugs based on ADAM inhibition exist. Most of the ADAM inhibitors developed to date feature zinc-binding moieties that target the active site zinc, which leads to a lack of selectivity and off target toxicity. Targeting secondary substrate binding sites (exosites) can potentially work as an alternative strategy for drug discovery; however, there are only a few reports of potential exosites in ADAM protease structures. In the study presented here, we utilized a series of TNFα-based substrates to probe ADAM10 and 17 interactions with its canonical substrate to identify the structural features that determine ADAM protease substrate specificity. We found that noncatalytic domains of ADAM17 did not directly bind the substrates used in the study but affected the binding nevertheless, most likely because of steric hindrance. Additionally, noncatalytic domains of ADAM17 affected the size/shape of the carbohydrate-binding pocket contained within the catalytic domain of ADAM17. This suggests that noncatalytic domains of ADAM17 play a role in substrate specificity and might help explain differences in substrate repertoires of ADAM17 and its closest homologue, ADAM10.

https://openalex.org/W1975933993,"G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) mediates both acute and chronic effects of free fatty acids (FFAs) on insulin secretion. However, it remains controversial whether inhibition of GPR40 would be beneficial in prevention of type 2 diabetes. This study is designed to evaluate the potential effects of DC260126, a small molecule antagonist of GPR40, on β-cell function following administration of 10 mg/kg dose of DC260126 to obese diabetic db/db mice. Oral glucose tolerance test, glucose stimulated insulin secretion and insulin tolerance test were used to investigate the pharmacological effects of DC260126 on db/db mice after 21-days treatment. Immunohistochemistry and serum biochemical analysis were also performed in this study. Although no significant change of blood glucose levels was found in DC260126-treated mice, DC260126 significantly inhibited glucose stimulated insulin secretion, reduced blood insulin level and improved insulin sensitivity after 3 weeks administration in db/db mice. Moreover, DC260126 reduced the proinsulin/insulin ratio and the apoptotic rate of pancreatic β-cells remarkably in DC260126-treated db/db mice compared to vehicle-treated mice (p<0.05, n = 8). The results suggest that although DC260126 could not provide benefit for improving hyperglycemia, it could protect against pancreatic β-cells dysfunction through reducing overload of β-cells, and it increases insulin sensitivity possibly via alleviation of hyperinsulinemia in db/db mice."
https://openalex.org/W2059470675,"White adipose tissue (WAT) is a multi-faceted endocrine organ involved in energy storage, metabolism, immune function and disease pathogenesis. In contrast to subcutaneous fat, visceral fat (V-WAT) has been associated with numerous diseases and metabolic disorders, indicating specific functions related to anatomical location. Although visceral depots are often used interchangeably in V-WAT-associated disease studies, there has been a recent subdivision of V-WAT into “true visceral” and non-visceral intra-abdominal compartments. These were associated with distinct physiological roles, illustrating a need for depot-specific information. Here, we use FACS analysis to comparatively characterize the leukocyte and progenitor populations in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of peritoneal serous fluid (PSF), parametrial (pmWAT), retroperitoneal (rpWAT), and omental (omWAT) adipose tissue from seven-month old C57BL/6 female mice. We found significant differences in SVF composition between all four microenvironments. PSF SVF was comprised almost entirely of CD45+ leukocytes (>99%), while omWAT contained less, but still almost two-fold more leukocytes than pmWAT and rpWAT (75%, 38% and 38% respectively; p<0.01). PmWAT was composed primarily of macrophages, whereas rpWAT more closely resembled omWAT, denoted by high levels of B1 B-cell and monocyte populations. Further, omWAT harbored significantly higher proportions of T-cells than the other tissues, consistent with its role as a secondary lymphoid organ. These SVF changes were also reflected in the gene expression profiles of the respective tissues. Thus, intra-abdominal fat pads represent independent immunomodulatory microenvironments and should be evaluated as distinct entities with unique contributions to physiological and pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1982072572,"Macrophages are an important line of defence against invading pathogens. Human macrophages derived by different methods were tested for their suitability as models to investigate Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) infection and compared to macrophage-like THP-1 cells. Human primary monocytes were isolated by either positive or negative immunomagnetic selection and differentiated in the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) into pro- or anti-inflammatory macrophages, respectively. Regardless of the isolation method, GM-CSF-derived macrophages (GM-Mφ) stained positive for CD206 and M-CSF-derived macrophages (M-Mφ) for CD163. THP-1 cells did not express CD206 or CD163 following incubation with PMA, M- or GM-CSF alone or in combination. Upon infection with Lm, all primary macrophages showed good survival at high multiplicities of infection whereas viability of THP-1 was severely reduced even at lower bacterial numbers. M-Mφ generally showed high phagocytosis of Lm. Strikingly, phagocytosis of Lm by GM-Mφ was markedly influenced by the method used for isolation of monocytes. GM-Mφ derived from negatively isolated monocytes showed low phagocytosis of Lm whereas GM-Mφ generated from positively selected monocytes displayed high phagocytosis of Lm. Moreover, incubation with CD14 antibody was sufficient to enhance phagocytosis of Lm by GM-Mφ generated from negatively isolated monocytes. By contrast, non-specific phagocytosis of latex beads by GM-Mφ was not influenced by treatment with CD14 antibody. Furthermore, phagocytosis of Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, human cytomegalovirus and the protozoan parasite Leishmania major by GM-Mφ was not enhanced upon treatment with CD14 antibody indicating that this effect is specific for Lm. Based on these observations, we propose macrophages derived by ex vivo differentiation of negatively selected human primary monocytes as the most suitable model to study Lm infection of macrophages."

Here, we present evidence on the extent of declines, current distribution and conservation status of Rhinoderma spp.; including information on abundance, habitat and threats to extant Darwin’s frog populations. All known archived Rhinoderma specimens were examined in museums in North America, Europe and South America. Extensive surveys were carried out throughout the historical ranges of R. rufum and R. darwinii from 2008 to 2012. Literature review and location data of 2,244 archived specimens were used to develop historical distribution maps for Rhinoderma spp. Based on records of sightings, optimal linear estimation was used to estimate whether R. rufum can be considered extinct. No extant R. rufum was found and our modelling inferred that this species became extinct in 1982 (95% CI, 1980–2000). Rhinoderma darwinii was found in 36 sites. All populations were within native forest and abundance was highest in Chiloé Island, when compared with Coast, Andes and South populations. Estimated population size and density (five populations) averaged 33.2 frogs/population (range, 10.2–56.3) and 14.9 frogs/100 m2 (range, 5.3–74.1), respectively. Our results provide further evidence that R. rufum is extinct and indicate that R. darwinii has declined to a much greater degree than previously recognised. Although this species can still be found across a large part of its historical range, remaining populations are small and severely fragmented. Conservation efforts for R. darwinii should be stepped up and the species re-classified as Endangered."

We observed that Fun30 repressed the expression of genes involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, the stress response, and meiosis. In addition, Fun30 was localized at the 5′ and 3′ ends of genes and within the open reading frames of its targets.

https://openalex.org/W2012172826,"The initial growth of the nacreous layer is crucial for comprehending the formation of nacreous aragonite. A flat pearl method in the presence of the inner-shell film was conducted to evaluate the role of matrix proteins in the initial stages of nacre biomineralization in vivo. We examined the crystals deposited on a substrate and the expression patterns of the matrix proteins in the mantle facing the substrate. In this study, the aragonite crystals nucleated on the surface at 5 days in the inner-shell film system. In the film-free system, the calcite crystals nucleated at 5 days, a new organic film covered the calcite, and the aragonite nucleated at 10 days. This meant that the nacre lamellae appeared in the inner-shell film system 5 days earlier than that in the film-free system, timing that was consistent with the maximum level of matrix proteins during the first 20 days. In addition, matrix proteins (Nacrein, MSI60, N19, N16 and Pif80) had similar expression patterns in controlling the sequential morphologies of the nacre growth in the inner-film system, while these proteins in the film-free system also had similar patterns of expression. These results suggest that matrix proteins regulate aragonite nucleation and growth with the inner-shell film in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1986262546,"Staphylococcus hominis is a commensal resident of human skin and an opportunistic pathogen. The species is subdivided into two subspecies, S. hominis subsp. hominis and S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus, which are difficult to distinguish. To investigate the evolution and epidemiology of S. hominis, a total of 108 isolates collected from 10 countries over 40 years were characterized by classical phenotypic methods and genetic methods. One nonsynonymous mutation in gyrB, scored with a novel SNP typing assay, had a perfect association with the novobiocin-resistant phenotype. A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme was developed from six housekeeping gene fragments, and revealed relatively high levels of genetic diversity and a significant impact of recombination on S. hominis population structure. Among the 40 sequence types (STs) identified by MLST, three STs (ST2, ST16 and ST23) were S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus, and they distinguished between isolates from different outbreaks, whereas 37 other STs were S. hominis subsp. hominis, one of which was widely disseminated (ST1). A modified PCR assay was developed to detect the presence of ccrAB4 from the SCCmec genetic element. S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus isolates were oxacillin-resistant and carriers of specific components of SCCmec (mecA class A, ccrAB3, ccrAB4, ccrC), whereas S. hominis subsp. hominis included both oxacillin-sensitive and -resistant isolates and a more diverse array of SCCmec components. Surprisingly, phylogenetic analyses indicated that S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus may be a polyphyletic and, hence, artificial taxon. In summary, these results revealed the genetic diversity of S. hominis, the identities of outbreak-causing clones, and the evolutionary relationships between subspecies and clones. The pathogenic lifestyle attributed to S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus may have originated on more than one occasion."
https://openalex.org/W2097890618,"Owing to its antimicrobial properties dietary tannins may alter the functional efficacy of probiotic lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal (GI)-tract influencing their growth, viability and molecular adaptation to the intestinal environment.The effects of tannic acid on Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 were studied by in vitro growth monitoring and visualizing the morphological alteration on the cell wall using transmission electron microscopy. Growth upon tannic acid was characterized by dose-dependent reductions of initial viable counts and extended lag phases. Lag phase-cells growing upon 0.5 mM tannic acid were abnormally shaped and experienced disturbance on the cell wall such as roughness, occasional leakage and release of cell debris, but resumed growth later at tannic acid concentrations high as 2.5 mM. To gain insight on how the response to tannic acid influenced the molecular adaptation of L. plantarum to the GI-tract conditions, gene expression of selected biomarkers for GI-survival was assessed by RT-qPCR on cDNA templates synthetized from mRNA samples obtained from cells treated with 0.5 or 2 mM tannic acid. Tannic acid-dependent gene induction was confirmed for selected genes highly expressed in the gut or with confirmed roles in GI-survival. No differential expression was observed for the pbp2A gene, a biomarker negatively related with GI-survival. However PBP2A was not labeled by Bocillin FL, a fluorescent dye-labeled penicillin V derivative, in the presence of tannic acid which suggests for enhanced GI-survival reportedly associated with the inactivation of this function.Probiotic L. plantarum WCFS1 is able to overcome the toxic effects of tannic acid. This dietary constituent modulates molecular traits linked to the adaptation to intestinal environment in ways previously shown to enhance GI-survival."
https://openalex.org/W2064162142,"Botulinum neurotoxins are the most toxic of all compounds. The toxicity is related to a poor zinc endopeptidase activity located in a 50-kDa domain known as light chain (Lc) of the toxin. The C-terminal tail of Lc is not visible in any of the currently available x-ray structures, and it has no known function but undergoes autocatalytic truncations during purification and storage. By synthesizing C-terminal peptides of various lengths, in this study, we have shown that these peptides competitively inhibit the normal catalytic activity of Lc of serotype A (LcA) and have defined the length of the mature LcA to consist of the first 444 residues. Two catalytically inactive mutants also inhibited LcA activity. Our results suggested that the C terminus of LcA might interact at or near its own active site. By using synthetic C-terminal peptides from LcB, LcC1, LcD, LcE, and LcF and their respective substrate peptides, we have shown that the inhibition of activity is specific only for LcA. Although a potent inhibitor with a Ki of 4.5 μm, the largest of our LcA C-terminal peptides stimulated LcA activity when added at near-stoichiometric concentration to three versions of LcA differing in their C-terminal lengths. The result suggested a product removal role of the LcA C terminus. This suggestion is supported by a weak but specific interaction determined by isothermal titration calorimetry between an LcA C-terminal peptide and N-terminal product from a peptide substrate of LcA. Our results also underscore the importance of using a mature LcA as an inhibitor screening target."
https://openalex.org/W2013478022,"Background and Purpose Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have been reported to be associated with metabolic syndrome and may predispose subjects to cardiovascular disease. The magnitude of the impact on the medical care remains to be elucidated. Based on a population-based claims dataset in Taiwan, we explored the association between LUTS and the risk of subsequent hospitalization for acute cardiovascular events. Materials and Methods Among a representative sample of one million subjects from nationwide health insurance enrollees, subjects with codes of LUTS in service claims and without previous cardiovascular diseases including stroke were compared with age- and sex-matched non-LUTS subjects in subsequent hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or stroke from the recruited date (between 2001–2004) to 2009. The risk of outcomes was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and the impact of LUTS was estimated with Poison regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Results We included 4,553 LUTS subjects and 22,765 matched non-LUTS subjects, with a mean age of 47 years and 43% of men. Hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia were more prevalent in the LUTS group. The incidence rate of the composite endpoint was significantly higher in the LUTS group than in the non-LUTS group (5.4/1000 vs. 4.0/1000 person-years). The difference mainly derived from stroke rather than acute coronary syndrome. After adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in multivariable analysis, LUTS remained a significant predictor (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence incidence, 1.06–1.50). Conclusion Subjects free of cardiovascular disease and presenting with LUTS are at risk of subsequent hospitalization for acute cardiovascular events, mainly stroke. The information might prompt practitioners encountering such patients to undergo appropriate diagnostic and preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W2081752268,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infects the gastric mucosa and persists for the life of the host. Bacterial persistence may be due to the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) whichmay have protective effects against other diseases such as asthma. It has been shown that H. pylori modulates the T cell response through dendritic cell reprogramming but the molecular pathways involved are relatively unknown. The goal of this study was to identify critical elements of dendritic cell (DC) activation and evaluate potential influence on immune activation. Microarray analysis was used to demonstrate limited gene expression changes in H. pylori stimulated bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) compared to the BMDCs stimulated with E. coli. IRAK-M, a negative regulator of TLR signaling, was upregulated and we selectedit for investigation of its role in modulating the DC and T cell responses. IRAK-M(-/-) and wild type BMDC were compared for their response to H. pylori. Cells lacking IRAK-M produced significantly greater amounts of proinflammatory MIP-2 and reduced amounts of immunomodulatory IL-10 than wild type BMDC. IRAK-M(-/-) cells also demonstrated increased MHC II expression upon activation. However, IRAK-M(-/-) BMDCs were comparable to wild type BMDCs in inducing T-helper 17 (TH17) and Treg responses as demonstrated in vitro using BMDC CD4+ T cells co-culture assays,and in vivo though the adoptive transfer of CD4(+) FoxP3-GFP T cells into H. pylori infected IRAK-M(-/-) mice. These results suggest that H. pylori infection leads to the upregulation of anti-inflammatory molecules like IRAK-M and that IRAK-M has a direct impact on innate functions in DCs such as cytokine and costimulation molecule upregulation but may not affect T cell skewing."

The aims of the study were: 1) To determine the reproducibility and consistency of GC; 2) To discover factors related to GG value. Given that metformin might increase glucose transport through the erythrocyte membrane, this treatment was also considered in the analyses of the results.GG was calculated in two blood samples separated 30.6 (SD 7.3) weeks, obtained in 508 type 2 diabetic patients. The following variables were considered: HbA1c, fructosamine, glucose, creatinine, hematological parameters and treatment with metformin. Multivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the variables independently related to CG.GG was reproducible and consistent over time. Creatinine, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and glycemia (inverse relationship); and HbA1c and treatment with metformin (direct relationship) were independently related to GG. Patients treated with metformin showed higher HbA1c values, despite similar fructosamine concentrations, than patients not treated with the drug.GG is independently related to serum levels of creatinine, MCHC and treatment with metformin. The spurious effect of metformin on Hb glycation could have serious clinical implications and should be considered when interpreting the results of clinical trials."

In many crops including maize, mining and application of novel dwarf genes are urgent to overcome genetic bottleneck and vulnerability during breeding improvement. Here we report the characterization and expression profiling analysis of a newly identified maize dwarf mutant Dwarf11 (D11). The D11 displays severely developmental abnormalities and is controlled by a dominant Mendelian factor. The D11 seedlings responds to both GA3 and paclobutrazol (PAC) application, suggesting that dwarf phenotype of D11 is caused by GA biosynthesis instead of GA signaling deficiency. In contrast, two well-characterized maize dominant dwarf plants D8 and D9 are all insensitive to exogenous GA3 stimulation. Additionally, sequence variation of D8 and D9 genes was not identified in the D11 mutant. Microarray and qRT-PCR analysis results demonstrated that transcripts encoding GA biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox), and GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox) are up-regulated in D11. Our results lay a foundation for the following D11 gene cloning and functional characterization. Moreover, results presented here may aid in crops molecular improvement and breeding, especially breeding of crops with plant height ideotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1974093529,"TGF-β signaling induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Clinical observations indicate that hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection, which is a major cause of HCC, induces TGF-β signaling perturbations. Here, we investigate the mechanisms by which HCV nonstructural proteins interfere with TGF-β signaling, in human hepatoma cell lines expressing HCV subgenomic replicon. A transcriptomic study showed that TGF-β stimulation of these cells resulted in a protumoral gene expression profile and in up-regulation of EMT-related genes compared to control interferon-treated cells not expressing HCV proteins. We found that the viral protease NS3-4A interacted with SMURF2, a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling. In cells expressing HCV subgenomic replicon or NS3-4A, TGF-β stimulation induced an increased expression of SMAD-dependent genes compared to control cells. This enhanced signaling was suppressed by SMURF2 overexpression and mimicked by SMURF2 silencing. In addition, NS3-4A expression resulted in an increased and prolonged TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 that was abrogated by SMURF2 overexpression. Neither NS3-4A protease activity nor SMURF2 ubiquitin-ligase activity was required to affect TGF-β signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2156311874,"The EVI1 (ecotropic viral integration site 1) gene at 3q26 codes for a transcriptional regulator with an essential role in haematopoiesis. Overexpression of EVI1 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is frequently associated with 3q26 rearrangements and confers extremely poor prognosis. EVI1 mediates transcriptional regulation, signalling, and epigenetic modifications by interacting with DNA, proteins and protein complexes. To explore to what extent protein phosphorylation impacts on EVI1 functions, we analysed endogenous EVI1 protein from a high EVI1 expressing Fanconi anaemia (FA) derived AML cell line. Mass spectrometric analysis of immunoprecipitated EVI1 revealed phosphorylation at serine 196 (S196) in the sixth zinc finger of the N-terminal zinc finger domain. Mutated EVI1 with an aspartate substitution at serine 196 (S196D), which mimics serine phosphorylation of this site, exhibited reduced DNA-binding and transcriptional repression from a gene promotor selectively targeted by the N-terminal zinc finger domain. Forced expression of the S196D mutant significantly reduced EVI1 mediated transformation of Rat1 fibroblasts. While EVI1-mediated serial replating of murine haematopoietic progenitors was maintained by EVI1-S196D, this was associated with significantly higher Evi1-trancript levels compared with WT-EVI1 or EVI1-S196A, mimicking S196 non-phosphorylated EVI1. These data suggest that EVI1 function is modulated by phosphorylation of the first zinc finger domain."
https://openalex.org/W2076641190,"Biotic interactions are often important in the establishment and spread of invasive species. In particular, competition between introduced and native species can strongly influence the distribution and spread of exotic species and in some cases competition among introduced species can be important. The Caribbean crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva, was recently introduced to the Gulf Coast of Texas, and appears to be spreading inland. It has been hypothesized that competition with the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, may be an important factor in the spread of crazy ants. We investigated the potential of interspecific competition among these two introduced ants by measuring interspecific aggression between Caribbean crazy ant workers and workers of Solenopsis invicta. Specifically, we examined the effect of body size and diet on individual-level aggressive interactions among crazy ant workers and fire ants. We found that differences in diet did not alter interactions between crazy ant workers from different nests, but carbohydrate level did play an important role in antagonistic interactions with fire ants: crazy ants on low sugar diets were more aggressive and less likely to be killed in aggressive encounters with fire ants. We found that large fire ants engaged in fewer fights with crazy ants than small fire ants, but fire ant size affected neither fire ant nor crazy ant mortality. Overall, crazy ants experienced higher mortality than fire ants after aggressive encounters. Our findings suggest that fire ant workers might outcompete crazy ant workers on an individual level, providing some biotic resistance to crazy ant range expansion. However, this resistance may be overcome by crazy ants that have a restricted sugar intake, which may occur when crazy ants are excluded from resources by fire ants."
https://openalex.org/W1974142911,"Background Activation of ErbB2/4 receptor tyrosine kinases in cardiomyocytes by neuregulin treatment is associated with improvement in cardiac function, supporting its use in human patients with heart failure despite the lack of a specific mechanism. Neuregulin infusion in rodents increases cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK) expression and cardiac myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation which may improve actin-myosin interactions for contraction. We generated a cMLCK knockout mouse to test the hypothesis that cMLCK is necessary for neuregulin-induced improvement in cardiac function by increasing RLC phosphorylation. Principal Findings The cMLCK knockout mice have attenuated RLC phosphorylation and decreased cardiac performance measured as fractional shortening. Neuregulin infusion for seven days in wildtype mice increased cardiac cMLCK protein expression and RLC phosphorylation while increasing Akt phosphorylation and decreasing phospholamban phosphorylation. There was no change in fractional shortening. In contrast, neuregulin infusion in cMLCK knockout animals increased cardiac performance in the absence of cMLCK without increasing RLC phosphorylation. In addition, CaMKII signaling appeared to be enhanced in neuregulin-treated knockout mice. Conclusions Thus, Neuregulin may improve cardiac performance in the failing heart without increasing cMLCK and RLC phosphorylation by activating other signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1980828312,"M36 is the first member of a novel class of potent HIV-1 entry inhibitors based on human engineered antibody domains (eAds). It exhibits broad inhibitory activity suggesting that its CD4-induced epitope is highly conserved. Here, we describe fine mapping of its epitope by using several approaches. First, a panel of mimotopes was affinity-selected from a random peptide library and potential m36-binding residues were computationally predicted. Second, homology modeling of m36 and molecular docking of m36 onto gp120 revealed potentially important residues in gp120-m36 interactions. Third, the predicted contact residues were verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Taken together, m36 epitope comprising three discontinuous sites including six key gp120 residues (Site C1: Thr123 and Pro124; Site C3: Glu370 and Ile371; Site C4: Met426 and Trp427) were identified. In the 3D structure of gp120, the sites C1 and C4 are located in the bridging sheet and the site C3 is within the β15-α3 excursion, which play essential roles for the receptor- and coreceptor-binding and are major targets of neutralizing antibodies. Based on these results we propose a precise localization of the m36 epitope and suggest a mechanism of its broad inhibitory activity which could help in the development of novel HIV-1 therapeutics based on eAds."
https://openalex.org/W2029692547,"Staphylococcus aureus protein A (SpA) is the most popular affinity ligand for immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). However, the molecular basis for the dissociation dynamics of SpA-IgG1 complex is unclear. Herein, coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the Martini force field were used to study the dissociation dynamics of the complex. The CG-MD simulations were first verified by the agreement in the structural and interactional properties of SpA and human IgG1 (hIgG1) in the association process between the CG-MD and all-atom MD at different NaCl concentrations. Then, the CG-MD simulation studies focused on the molecular insight into the dissociation dynamics of SpA-hIgG1 complex at pH 3.0. It is found that there are four steps in the dissociation process of the complex. First, there is a slight conformational adjustment of helix II in SpA. This is followed by the phenomena that the electrostatic interactions provided by the three hot spots (Glu143, Arg146 and Lys154) of helix II of SpA break up, leading to the dissociation of helix II from the binding site of hIgG1. Subsequently, breakup of the hydrophobic interactions between helix I (Phe132, Tyr133 and His137) in SpA and hIgG1 occurs, resulting in the disengagement of helix I from its binding site of hIgG1. Finally, the non-specific interactions between SpA and hIgG1 decrease slowly till disappearance, leading to the complete dissociation of the SpA-hIgG1 complex. This work has revealed that CG-MD coupled with the Martini force field is an effective method for studying the dissociation dynamics of protein-protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W2121254950,"Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas’ disease, has a complex life cycle which involves the invasion of mammalian host cells, differentiation and intracellular replication. Here we report the first insights into the biological role of a poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase in a trypanosomatid (TcPARG). In silico analysis of the TcPARG gene pointed out the conservation of key residues involved in the catalytic process and, by Western blot, we demonstrated that it is expressed in a life stage-dependant manner. Indirect immunofluorescence assays and electron microscopy using an anti-TcPARG antibody showed that this enzyme is localized in the nucleus independently of the presence of DNA damage or cell cycle stage. The addition of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase inhibitors ADP-HPD (adenosine diphosphate (hydroxymethyl) pyrrolidinediol) or DEA (6,9-diamino-2-ethoxyacridine lactate monohydrate) to the culture media, both at a 1 µM concentration, reduced in vitro epimastigote growth by 35% and 37% respectively, when compared to control cultures. We also showed that ADP-HPD 1 µM can lead to an alteration in the progression of the cell cycle in hydroxyurea synchronized cultures of T. cruzi epimastigotes. Outstandingly, here we demonstrate that the lack of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase activity in Vero and A549 host cells, achieved by chemical inhibition or iRNA, produces the reduction of the percentage of infected cells as well as the number of amastigotes per cell and trypomastigotes released, leading to a nearly complete abrogation of the infection process. We conclude that both, T. cruzi and the host, poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase activities are important players in the life cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi, emerging as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of Chagas’ disease."
https://openalex.org/W2018806883,"Ryanodine receptors are homotetrameric intracellular calcium release channels. The efficiency of these channels is underpinned by exceptional rates of cation translocation through the open channel and this is achieved at the expense of the high degree of selectivity characteristic of many other types of channel. Crystallization of prokaryotic potassium channels has provided insights into the structures and mechanisms responsible for ion selection and movement in these channels, however no equivalent structural detail is currently available for ryanodine receptors. Nevertheless both molecular modeling and cryo-electron microscopy have identified the probable pore-forming region (PFR) of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and suggest that this region contains structural elements equivalent to those of the PFRs of potassium-selective channels. The aim of the current study was to establish if the isolated putative cardiac RyR (RyR2) PFR could form a functional ion channel. We have expressed and purified the RyR2 PFR and shown that function is retained following reconstitution into planar phospholipid bilayers. Our data provide the first direct experimental evidence to support the proposal that the conduction pathway of RyR2 is formed by structural elements equivalent to those of the potassium channel PFR."
https://openalex.org/W2076245996,"The loss of gap junctional intercellular communication is characteristic of neoplastic cells, suggesting that the restoration with a gap junction enhancer may be a new therapeutic treatment option with less detrimental effects than traditional antineoplastic drugs. A gap junction enhancer, 6-methoxy-8-[(2-furanylmethyl) amino]-4-methyl-5-(3-trifluoromethylphenyloxy) quinoline (PQ7), on the normal tissue was evaluated in healthy C57BL/6J mice in a systemic drug distribution study. Immunoblot analysis of the vital organs indicates a reduction in Cx43 expression in PQ7-treated animals with no observable change in morphology. Next the transgenic strain FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT) 634Mul/J (also known as PyVT) was used as a spontaneous mammary tumor mouse model to determine the biological and histological effects of PQ7 on tumorigenesis and metastasis at three stages of development: Pre tumor, Early tumor, and Late tumor formation. PQ7 was assessed to have a low toxicity through intraperitoneal administration, with the majority of the compound being detected in the heart, liver, and lungs six hours post injection. The treatment of tumor bearing animals with PQ7 had a 98% reduction in tumor growth, while also decreasing the total tumor burden compared to control mice during the Pre stage of development. PQ7 treatment increased Cx43 expression in the neoplastic tissue during Pre-tumor formation; however, this effect was not observed in Late stage tumor formation. This study shows that the gap junction enhancer, PQ7, has low toxicity to normal tissue in healthy C57BL/6J mice, while having clinical efficacy in the treatment of spontaneous mammary tumors of PyVT mice. Additionally, gap junctional intercellular communication and neoplastic cellular growth are shown to be inversely related, while treatment with PQ7 inhibits tumor growth through targeting gap junction expression."

However, because of the genetic heterogeneity, it is largely unknown for the role of these loci in the breast cancer susceptibility in the populations of non-European descent.Here, we genotyped three variants (rs10771399 at 12p11, rs1292011 at 12q24 and rs2823093 at 21q21) in an independent case-control study with a total of 1792 breast cancer cases and 1867 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. We found that rs10771399 and rs1292011 were significantly associated with risk of breast cancer with per-allele odds ratios (ORs) of 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76-0.96; P = 0.010) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76-0.95; P = 4.50×10(-3)), respectively, which was consistent with those reported in populations of European descent. Similar effects were observed between ER/PR positive and negative breast cancer for both loci. However, we did not found significant association between rs2823093 and breast cancer risk (OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.76-1.24; P = 0.795).Our results indicate that genetic variants at 12p11 and 12q24 may also play an important role in breast cancer development in Chinese women."
