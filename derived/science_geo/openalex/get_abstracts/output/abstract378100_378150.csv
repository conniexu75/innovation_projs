https://openalex.org/W2047031255,"RECENTLY diffraction patterns have been produced in this laboratory1 by using ultrasonic waves of frequencies higher than 100 Mc./sec. At such high frequencies, the patterns show some interesting features. Progressive waves of frequency 102.6 Mc./sec. and maintained in water have been employed. When the sound wave is exactly normal to the incident light, the diffraction pattern disappears altogether. On tilting the crystal holder to one side or the other, so that the light rays meet the sound wave-front at an angle of 52', the first-order diffraction line alone on the appropriate side is obtained. This angle agrees closely with the value derived from the equation ?/?8=2µ sin I¸ where I» and I»* are the wave-lengths employed and Âµ is the refractive index of water. In no position of the sound wave-front has it been possible to get the first-order line on both sides at the same time. The value of the above angle for which the first-order line attains the maximum intensity is quite critical. Even a slight variation of about 2' has been found to reduce its intensity to half. Thus the diffraction effect at such high frequencies (I»* = 0·00148 cm.) appears to be very much like reflexion in the Bragg sense."

https://openalex.org/W2068504605,"EXPERIMENTAL unimolecular reaction-rates in gases are adequately represented by the equation : where N is the concentration, T the absolute temperature, and k is Boltzmann's constant. The fact that a is in most cases found to be of the order of magnitude of intramolecular vibration frequencies (1014 see.-1) has been much discussed. By an approach akin to that of Polanyi and Wigner1, I obtained a theoretical reaction-rate in which a, although not precisely determined, was of this order of magnitude2,3. This result can nOw be made precise."

https://openalex.org/W1974048008,"dl-SERINE introduced either by stomach tube or by intraperitoneal injection causes severe kidney damage in young rats1,2. In view of the probable interaction of serine and methionine in the rat3,4, the influence of methionine on the serine effect was studied. Male rats weighing approximately 100 gm. were given 100 mgm. dl-serine by stomach tube and killed 24 hours later. Litter mates received the same amount of serine, and in addition dl-methionine in amounts varying from 100 to 600 mgm. subcutaneously in several injections preceding and following the administration of serine. 24 rats given serine alone showed extensive renal necrosis localized in the region of the corticomedullary junction (see Fig. 1). Of 39 animals given methionine in addition, 30 showed no lesions or only minute lesions (see Fig. 2). Only in two rats was no protective effect seen."
https://openalex.org/W1993109764,"MOST of the preparations with a chemotherapeutic effect against tubercle bacilli which have hitherto been tested have been bacteriostatic. The reactions occurring between chemotherapeutic substances of this type and the bacterial cell are of a reversible character. A considerably better effect should be achieved if a preparation producing irreversible changes could be discovered. The simple sulphanilamides, that is, those the effect of which is counteracted by para-aminobenzoic acid, are typical of such bacteriostatic substances. They give a good effect in vitro, and in animal experiments they show a definite though weak effect1. Derivatives of the simple sulphanilamides, for example, promin, have given better results in in vivo experiments2."

https://openalex.org/W2059334155,"CONVENTIONAL views on hæmopoiesis may be said to be well founded, in spite of the fact that beliefs in the transformation of precursor elements to definitive blood cells, through a series of specific cell stages, represent, so far as the adult mammal is concerned, dynamic concepts based upon more or less discontinuous observationsÂ in the sense that no one has observed, either in vitro or otherwise, the whole process of transformation in adult tissue. Because of this it is not surprising that the facts have been interpreted differently at different times, and that more than one view has been advanced about the development of the blood elements. Equally, it is not surprising that commonly expressed views fail to account for all the known facts. The observations that are reported in this note fall so far outside current generalizations that they seem to lend themselves to a complementary hypothesis of blood formation."

https://openalex.org/W2985954801,"DR. M. VENGEROV has described a method of gas analysis under this title1. As the method has been in practical use in the chemical industry for about ten years, I should like to direct attention to the self-recording infra-red absorption apparatus, called 'Uras', developed by Dr. Luft-Oppau."

This is scarcely surprising in view of the number of variables involved, within the material itself and in the conditions of its spoilage. In the work here reported, the samples of ghee were prepared with some care and represent genuine products in good condition ; the specimens examined were not chosen at random but belonged to three definite types—one, from Kirkee, of high Reichert value (30–40) and low iodine value (c. 28) typical of well-kept dairy buffaloes, another of normal Reichert value (c. 25) and iodine value (c. 38) from dairy cows, and the third of low Reichert value (14–22) and high iodine value (33–40) derived from buffaloes fed mainly on cotton-seed. The samples had all been stored in similar conditions, namely, in glass bottles with fairly loose-fitting wooden corks placed in a laboratory cupboard for periods of three to four years at a temperature range of 15–25° C. The analytical characteristics of the samples were determined before and after storage, and the average changes in each group were as below."

Tests with a series of several other steroid hormones, on the other hand, were negative. Testosterone administered intracutaneously in increasing doses for the purpose of desensitization brought about a striking improvement of the ocular condition in all the patients. In cases in which the keratitis rosacea was associated with facial rosacea, a distinct improvement was also observed in the latter condition."

https://openalex.org/W2069633298,"THE thermal dissociation of nitrous oxide has received considerable attention in the past in connexion with the collision theory of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions1, and it is known that oxygen atoms can be produced as a result of the primary dissociation N2O = N2 + O. This dissociation was considered to be the chain-initiating process in the H2—N2O reaction by Melville2, and in the CO—N2O reaction by Bawn3. In view of the production of atomic oxygen in the decomposition of nitrous oxide, some work has been carried out on the N2O—SO2 system in order to obtain some basic information on the association reaction SO2 + O = SO3, a process believed to be of some importance in relation to the oxidation of sulphur dioxide in flames4. This work will be reported in detail elsewhere ; but it is the purpose of this note to describe some observations on the nature of the luminescence accompanying the decomposition of nitrous oxide at temperatures of the order of 900° C., and the effect of various additions on this. Zeldovitsch and Jakovlev5 have studied briefly the explosive decomposition of nitrous oxide at high temperatures, and the appearance of yellow-green flashes in the combustion of carbon in nitrous oxide at 600–800° C. has been recorded by Shaw6 and Arthur7."

https://openalex.org/W2043419265,"IN the course of a recent investigation of the food-plants of the Chrysomelidae, a family of about 27,000 species of phytophagous beetles, I have tabulated all available records in relation to the systematic groups simultaneously of the beetles and of the food-plants concerned. The results of this investigation have not yet been published, but they lead me to consider that it would be of interest to investigate the extent to which the following propositions are true for insects in general : If insects of any given species can feed on plants of more than one species, then insects of any other species that can feed on any of these plant species can feed on all these plant species."

https://openalex.org/W4211197382,"EARLY in March 1946, the Institution of Electrical Engineers held a Radiolocation Conference at which were presented a large number of lectures and papers by various members and other individuals who had contributed to the development and application of radiolocation during the war years. The Convention was formally opened at an ordinary meeting of the Institution by the Minister of Supply, Mr. John Wilmot, and was followed by a lecture on “The Evolution of Radiolocation” by Sir Robert Watson-Watt. In the course of this lecture it was explained that the object of the Convention was to describe and discuss British activities in this subject, which began in February 1935 and were at first conducted independently of any similar work elsewhere. Following the co-operation established between Great Britain and the United States in the autumn of 1940, later developments were conducted on the basis of a United Nations' system for which the name 'radar' was adopted in 1943, this term being then in current use in the United States."
