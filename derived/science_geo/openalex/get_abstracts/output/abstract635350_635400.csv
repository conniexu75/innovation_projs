https://openalex.org/W2954157188,"Early detection and treatment are critical for improving the outcome of patients with cancer1. Understanding the largely uncharted biology of carcinogenesis requires deciphering molecular processes in premalignant lesions, and revealing the determinants of the intralesional immune reaction during cancer development. The adaptive immune response within tumours has previously been shown to be strongest at the earliest stage of carcinoma2,3. Here we show that immune activation and immune escape occur before tumour invasion, and reveal the relevant immune biomarkers of the pre-invasive stages of carcinogenesis in the lung. We used gene-expression profiling and multispectral imaging to analyse a dataset of 9 morphological stages of the development of lung squamous cell carcinoma, which includes 122 well-annotated biopsies from 77 patients. We identified evolutionary trajectories of cancer and immune pathways that comprise (1) a linear increase in proliferation and DNA repair from normal to cancerous tissue; (2) a transitory increase of metabolism and early immune sensing, through the activation of resident immune cells, in low-grade pre-invasive lesions; (3) the activation of immune responses and immune escape through immune checkpoints and suppressive interleukins from high-grade pre-invasive lesions; and, ultimately, (4) the activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the invasive stage of cancer. We propose that carcinogenesis in the lung involves a dynamic co-evolution of pre-invasive bronchial cells and the immune response. These findings highlight the need to develop immune biomarkers for early detection as well as immunotherapy-based chemopreventive approaches for individuals who are at high risk of developing lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2953771712,"Type 4 P-type ATPases (P4-ATPases) are lipid flippases that drive the active transport of phospholipids from exoplasmic or luminal leaflets to cytosolic leaflets of eukaryotic membranes. The molecular architecture of P4-ATPases and the mechanism through which they recognize and transport lipids have remained unknown. Here we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the P4-ATPase Drs2p-Cdc50p, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae lipid flippase that is specific to phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Drs2p-Cdc50p is autoinhibited by the C-terminal tail of Drs2p, and activated by the lipid phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P or PI4P). We present three structures that represent the complex in an autoinhibited, an intermediate and a fully activated state. The analysis highlights specific features of P4-ATPases and reveals sites of autoinhibition and PI4P-dependent activation. We also observe a putative lipid translocation pathway in this flippase that involves a conserved PISL motif in transmembrane segment 4 and polar residues of transmembrane segments 2 and 5, in particular Lys1018, in the centre of the lipid bilayer."

https://openalex.org/W2955794706,"Carbapenemase-producing bacteria (CPB) are rare, multidrug resistant organisms most commonly associated with hospitalized patients. Metropolitan wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) treat wastewater from large geographic areas which include hospitals and may serve as epidemiologic reservoirs for the maintenance or expansion of CPB that originate from hospitals and are ultimately discharged in treated effluent. However, little is known about the potential impact of these WWTP CPB on the local surface water and their risk to the public health. In addition, CPB that are present in surface water may ultimately disseminate to intensively-managed animal agriculture facilities where there is potential for amplification by extended-spectrum cephalosporins. To better understand the role of WWTPs in the dissemination of CPB in surface waters, we obtained samples of treated effluent, and both upstream and downstream nearby surface water from 50 WWTPs throughout the US. A total of 30 CPB with clinically-relevant genotypes were recovered from 15 WWTPs (30%) of which 13 (50%) serviced large metropolitan areas and 2 (8.3%) represented small rural populations (P < 0.05). Recovery of CPB was lowest among WWTPs that utilized ultraviolet radiation for primary disinfection (12%), and higher (P = 0.11) for WWTPs that used chlorination (42%) or that did not utilize disinfection (50%). We did not detect a difference in CPB recovery by sampling site, although fewer CPB were detected in upstream (8%) compared to effluent (20%) and downstream (18%) samples. Our results indicate that WWTP effluent and nearby surface waters in the US are routinely contaminated with CPB with clinically important genotypes including those producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). This is a concern for both public health and animal agriculture because introduction of CPB into intensively managed livestock populations could lead to their amplification and foodborne dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2954286747,"The prediction of readmission or death after a hospital discharge for heart failure (HF) remains a major challenge. Modern healthcare systems, electronic health records, and machine learning (ML) techniques allow us to mine data to select the most significant variables (allowing for reduction in the number of variables) without compromising the performance of models used for prediction of readmission and death. Moreover, ML methods based on transformation of variables may potentially further improve the performance.To use ML techniques to determine the most relevant and also transform variables for the prediction of 30-day readmission or death in HF patients.We identified all Western Australian patients aged 65 years and above admitted for HF between 2003-2008 in linked administrative data. We evaluated variables associated with HF readmission or death using standard statistical and ML based selection techniques. We also tested the new variables produced by transformation of the original variables. We developed multi-layer perceptron prediction models and compared their predictive performance using metrics such as Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.Following hospital discharge, the proportion of 30-day readmissions or death was 23.7% in our cohort of 10,757 HF patients. The prediction model developed by us using a smaller set of variables (n = 8) had comparable performance (AUC 0.62) to the traditional model (n = 47, AUC 0.62). Transformation of the original 47 variables further improved (p<0.001) the performance of the predictive model (AUC 0.66).A small set of variables selected using ML matched the performance of the model that used the full set of 47 variables for predicting 30-day readmission or death in HF patients. Model performance can be further significantly improved by transforming the original variables using ML methods."
https://openalex.org/W2954581489,"The present study aimed to evaluate the probiotic characteristics of certain microbial strains for potential use as feed additives. Three bacterial strains and a yeast previously isolated from different environments were investigated. The strains were subjected to molecular identification and established as Lactobacillus paracasei CP133, Lactobacillus plantarum CP134, Bacillus subtilis CP350 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CP605. Lactobacillus sp. CP133 and CP134 exhibited antibiosis, antibiotic activity, and relative odor reduction ability. Bacillus subtilis CP350 was thermotolerant, reduced hydrogen sulfide gas and showed significant proteolytic activity, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae CP605 exhibited high acid and bile salt tolerance. In general, the isolates in this study demonstrated improved functional characteristics, particularly acid and bile tolerance and relative cell adhesion to HT-29 monolayer cell line. Results in this work provides multifunctional probiotic characteristics of the strains for potential development of probiotics and cleaning of the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2955732908,"Atypical antipsychotic medications such as risperidone are widely prescribed for diverse psychiatric indications including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. These medications have complex pharmacology and are associated with significant endocrine and metabolic side effects. This class of medications also carries FDA black box warnings due to increased risk of death in elderly patients. Clinical reports indicate that patients treated with these medications are more susceptible to infections; however, the underlying mechanisms/pharmacology are unclear. We have previously reported that risperidone and it’s active metabolite distributes to the bone marrow in clinically relevant concentrations in preclinical species, leading us to hypothesize that the hematopoietic system may be impacted by these medications. To test this hypothesis, using proteomic and cytokine array technology, we evaluated the expression of genes involved in inflammatory and immune function following short term (5 days) and longer term (4 weeks) treatment in healthy animals. We report that low-dose risperidone treatment results in global immunosuppression in mice, observed following 5 days of dosing and exacerbated with longer term drug treatment (4 weeks). These data are consistent with increased susceptibility to infection in patients administered these medications and have profound implications for the increasing off-label prescribing to vulnerable patient populations including children and the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2954828165,"This study aimed to assess consumers’ uses of and opinions on the current Brazilian food label and their reaction to the introduction of a front-of-package warning label. We conducted 12 focus groups among a diverse sample of adult consumers, to broadly assess: (1) uses of and perceptions about the current food label, and (2) opinions about implementing a front-of-package warning label to guide food purchases. Data was analyzed with a triangulation of researchers using an exploratory content analysis, which allowed codes to emerge from the data. The frequency of codes across focus groups was compared by gender and socioeconomic status to explore differences by these sociodemographic factors. Codes were divided into six main themes: (1) “Reasons for using food labels”; (2) “Barriers to using food labels”; (3) “Requirements for a new label”; (4) “Perceived influence on consumption behaviors”; (5) “Perceived influence on child behaviors”; and (6) “Perceptions of the food manufacturers using of warning labels”. Participants used food labels to check nutrient content and ingredient information but the format of these labels and the technicality of the content displayed often made the information inaccessible, particularly for those with low socioeconomic status. Most participants were supportive of the display of front-of-package warning labels on products and considered them useful to inform purchases. Women believed that they and their children would reduce the consumption of foods with front-of-package warning labels, while men reported more polarity in their intentions. For men and their children, front-of-package warning labels would result in either stopping food intake entirely or continued consumption without changes to the amount. The study results highlight the potential of front-of-package warning labels to support healthier behaviors in both consumers and their children."
https://openalex.org/W2955025593,"Although environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly being used to survey for the presence of rare and/or invasive fishes in aquatic systems, the utility of this technique has been limited by a poor understanding of whether and how eDNA concentrations relate to fish density, especially in rivers. We conducted a field study to systematically test whether the eDNA released by a model invasive fish, Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), was related to the density of this species in a large river. We quantified fish density throughout the 460 km long Illinois River using hydroacoustic surveys at 23 sites while concurrently collecting 192 surface water samples for eDNA analysis. We found that Silver Carp numerical density and biomass density were positively and non-linearly related to eDNA concentration and detection rate. Both eDNA concentration (copy number) and detection rate increased rapidly as Silver Carp density increased but plateaued at moderate densities. These relationships could prove useful for estimating Silver Carp relative abundance in newly invaded locations where population numbers are low to moderate. Future studies should explore the causes of this nonlinear relationship as it would ultimately benefit aquatic species monitoring and management programs."
https://openalex.org/W2955055632,"An emerging cellular immunotherapy for cancer is based on the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells against a wide range of tumors. Although in vitro activation, or ""priming,"" of NK cells by exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, has been extensively studied, the biological consequences of NK cell activation in response to target cell interactions have not been thoroughly characterized. We investigated the consequences of co-incubation with K562, CTV-1, Daudi RPMI-8226, and MCF-7 tumor cell lines on the phenotype, cytokine expression profile, and transcriptome of human NK cells. We observe the downregulation of several activation receptors including CD16, CD62L, C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR)-4, natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D), DNAX accessory molecule (DNAM)-1, and NKp46 following tumor-priming. Although this NK cell phenotype is typically associated with NK cell dysfunction in cancer, we reveal the upregulation of NK cell activation markers, such as CD69 and CD25; secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1) α /β and IL-1β/6/8; and overexpression of numerous genes associated with enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory functions, such as FAS, TNFSF10, MAPK11, TNF, and IFNG. Thus, it appears that tumor-mediated ligation of receptors on NK cells may induce a primed state which may or may not lead to full triggering of the lytic or cytokine secreting machinery. Key signaling molecules exclusively affected by tumor-priming include MAP2K3, MARCKSL1, STAT5A, and TNFAIP3, which are specifically associated with NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor targets. Collectively, these findings help define the phenotypic and transcriptional signature of NK cells following their encounters with tumor cells, independent of cytokine stimulation, and provide insight into tumor-specific NK cell responses to inform the transition toward harnessing the therapeutic potential of NK cells in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2953649359,"Despite the benefits of evidence-based self-care behaviors in the management of hypertension, hypertensive patients have low rate of adherence to the recommended self-care behaviors. Studies related to self-care behaviors among hypertensive patients are limited in Ethiopia.To assess the rate of adherence to self-care behaviors and associated factors among hypertensive patients.A cross-sectional study was conducted at the cardiac clinic of Ayder comprehensive specialized hospital among ambulatory hypertensive patients. Self-care behaviors were assessed using an adopted Hypertension Self-Care Activity Level Effects (H-SCALE). Data were collected through patient interview and review of medical records. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of self-care behaviors.A total of 276 patients were included in the study. The majority of the participants were nonsmokers (89.9%) and alcohol abstainers (68.8%). Less than half of the participants were adherent to the prescribed antihypertensive medications (48.2%) and recommended physical activity level (44.9%). Moreover, only 21.45% and 29% were adherent to weight management and low salt diet recommendations, respectively. Our finding indicated that rural resident (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.97), comorbidity (AOR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.08-0.31), and negative medication belief (AOR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.14-0.46) were significantly associated with medication adherence. Female sex (AOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23-0.92), old age (AOR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06-0.60) and lack of knowledge on self-care behaviors (AOR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.57) were significantly associated with adherence to weight management. Female sex (AOR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.03-3.75) and lack of knowledge on self-care (AOR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03-0.16) were significantly associated with adherence to alcohol abstinence. Female sex (AOR: 6.33, 95% CI: 1.80-22.31) and khat chewing (AOR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.03-0.24) were significantly associated with non-smoking behavior. There was also a significant association between female sex and physical activity (AOR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.12-0.40).The rate of adherence to self-care behaviors particularly weight management, low salt intake, physical exercise, and medication intake was low in our study. Elders, females, khat chewers, rural residents, and patients with negative medication belief, comorbidity, and inadequate knowledge of SCBs were less adherent to self-care behaviors compared to their counterparts. Therefore, health care providers should pay more emphasis to patients at risk of having low self-care behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2955729937,"To isolate and characterize oral extracellular vesicles from gingival crevicular fluid at 11-14 weeks and evaluate their capacity to identify patients at risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus.A case-control study was conducted, including patients who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 11) and healthy pregnant controls (n = 23). Obstetric and periodontal histories were recorded at 11-14 weeks of gestation, and samples of gingival crevicular fluid obtained. Extracellular vesicles were isolated from gingival crevicular fluid by ExoQuick. Nanoparticle tracking analysis, ELISA and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize extracellular vesicles.Total extracellular vesicles isolated from gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in patients who developed gestational diabetes mellitus later in pregnancy compared to normoglycemic pregnant women (6.3x109 vs 1.7 x1010, p value = 0.0026), and the concentration of the extracellular vesicles delivered an area under the ROC curve of 0.81. The distribution size of extracellular vesicles obtained using ExoQuick was around 148 ± 57 nm. There were no significant differences in the periodontal status between cases and controls. The exosome transmembrane protein CD63 was also detected in the extracellular vesicles of gingival crevicular fluid.We were able to isolate extracellular vesicles from gingival crevicular fluid using a method that is suitable to be applied in a clinical setting. Our results provide an insight into the potential capacity of first trimester oral extracellular vesicles as early biomarkers for the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus in pre-symptomatic women."
https://openalex.org/W2954075588,"Short-term traffic speed prediction is a key component of proactive traffic control in the intelligent transportation systems. The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term traffic speed prediction under different data collection time intervals. Traffic speed data was collected from an urban freeway in Edmonton, Canada. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average plus seasonal discrete grey model structure (SARIMA-SDGM) was proposed to perform the traffic speed prediction. The model performance of SARIMA-SDGM model was compared with that of the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, seasonal discrete grey model (SDGM), artificial neural network (ANN) model, and support vector regression (SVR) model. The results showed that SARIMA-SDGM model performs best with the lowest mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the root mean square error (RMSE). The traffic speed prediction accuracy under different time intervals were compared based on the SARIMA-SDGM model. The results showed that the prediction accuracy improves with the increase in time interval. In addition, when the time interval is greater than 10 min, the prediction results yield stable prediction accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2954163546,"The adaptability of cassava to low fertile and marginal soils facilitates its production in subsistent agriculture. As a result, smallholder farmers rarely apply fertilizers. The current yield gap is therefore very large, calling for application of fertilizers and soil amendments to improve its productivity. Field experiments were carried out to assess the potential of partially substituting Phosphorus (P) fertilizers by in vitro-produced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) inoculants in cassava production in two agro-ecologies of Nigeria: Northern Guinea Savanna (Samaru) and Sudan Savanna (Minjibir). The experiments were laid out in a split plot design with P levels (0, 17.5, 35 and 52.5 kg P2O5 ha-1) as main plot and AMF inoculants (Control, Glomygel, Glomygel carrier, Mycodrip, Mycodrip carrier) as subplots. The results in Samaru showed that there was significant interaction between AMF and P in root fresh weight, total biomass and root to shoot ratio. The root fresh weights of the inoculated cassava increased proportionally with application of P. However, highest root fresh weight of cassava inoculated with Glomygel was observed at 35 kg P2O5 ha-1 recording 25% yield increase compared to 52.5 kg P2O5 ha-1 application. Interestingly, Cassava inoculated with Glomygel at 17.5 kg P2O5 ha-1 gave root fresh yield statistically similar to where 35 kg P2O5 ha-1 was applied. This represented a 50% reduction in P fertilizer use. Also, cassava inoculated with Glomygel increased leaf nutrient concentrations, which strongly correlated with the root fresh yield. However, no effects of inoculant carriers were observed in yield and nutrient concentrations. Contrarily, there was no significant treatment effect in Minjibir for nearly all the measured parameters. Cassava yield was however, higher in Minjibir than Samaru probably due to soil fertility and structural differences, which resulted in few observable effects of AMF and P treatments at Minjibir. We conclude that under low P conditions inoculation with in vitro produced AMF inoculants could be employed to reduce P fertilizer requirements for cassava and improve yields, but the variability of the responses as a result of soil heterogeneity and the identity of the fungal strain in the inoculant require further investigations before recommending the practice."
https://openalex.org/W2954200540,"Castleman disease (CD) describes a spectrum of heterogeneous disorders defined by characteristic lymph node histopathology. Enlarged lymph nodes demonstrating CD histopathology can occur in isolation (unicentric CD; UCD) sometimes accompanied by mild symptoms, or at multiple sites (multicentric CD, MCD) with systemic inflammation and cytokine-driven multi-organ dysfunction. The discovery that Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus/human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 drives MCD in a subset of patients has led to the hypotheses that UCD and MCD patients with negative HHV-8 testing by conventional methods may represent false negatives, or that these cases are driven by another virus, known or unknown. To investigate these hypotheses, the virome capture sequencing for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) platform was employed to detect RNA transcripts from known and novel viruses in fresh frozen lymph node tissue from CD patients (12 UCD, 11 HHV-8-negative MCD [idiopathic MCD; iMCD], and two HHV-8-positive MCD) and related diseases (three T cell lymphoma and three Hodgkin lymphoma). This assay detected HHV-8 in both HHV-8-positive cases; however, HHV-8 was not found in clinically HHV-8-negative iMCD or UCD cases. Additionally, no novel viruses were discovered, and no single known virus was detected with apparent association to HHV-8-negative CD cases. Herpesviridae family members, notably including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), were detected in 7 out of 12 UCD and 5 of 11 iMCD cases with apparent correlations with markers of disease severity in iMCD. Analysis of a separate cohort of archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node tissue by In situ hybridization revealed significantly fewer EBV-positive cells in UCD and iMCD compared to tissue from HHV-8-positive MCD and EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. In an additional cohort, quantitative testing for EBV by PCR in peripheral blood during disease flare did not detect systemic EBV viremia, suggesting detection lymph node tissue is due to occult, local reactivation in UCD and iMCD. This study confirms that HHV-8 is not present in UCD and iMCD patients. Further, it fails to establish a clear association between any single virus, novel or known, and CD in HHV-8-negative cases. Given that distinct forms of CD exist with viral and non-viral etiological drivers, CD should be considered a group of distinct and separate diseases with heterogeneous causes worthy of further study."
https://openalex.org/W2908727066,"Although interdisciplinarity is often touted as a necessity for modern research, the evidence on the relative impact of sectorial versus to interdisciplinary science is qualitative at best. In this paper we leverage the bibliographic data set of the American Physical Society to quantify the role of interdisciplinarity in physics, and that of talent and luck in achieving success in scientific careers. We analyze a period of 30 years (1980-2009) tagging papers and their authors by means of the Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS), to show that some degree of interdisciplinarity is quite helpful to reach success, measured as a proxy of either the number of articles or the citations score. We also propose an agent-based model of the publication-reputation-citation dynamics which reproduces the trends observed in the APS data set. On the one hand, the results highlight the crucial role of randomness and serendipity in real scientific research; on the other, they shed light on a counterintuitive effect indicating that the most talented authors are not necessarily the most successful ones."
https://openalex.org/W2953484990,"Background A key issue in the analysis of many spatial processes is the choice of an appropriate scale for the analysis. Smaller geographical units are generally preferable for the study of human phenomena because they are less likely to cause heterogeneous groups to be conflated. However, it can be harder to obtain data for small units and small-number problems can frustrate quantitative analysis. This research presents a new approach that can be used to estimate the most appropriate scale at which to aggregate point data to areas. Data and methods The proposed method works by creating a number of regular grids with iteratively smaller cell sizes (increasing grid resolution) and estimating the similarity between two realisations of the point pattern at each resolution. The method is applied first to simulated point patterns and then to real publicly available crime data from the city of Vancouver, Canada. The crime types tested are residential burglary, commercial burglary, theft from vehicle and theft of bike. Findings The results provide evidence for the size of spatial unit that is the most appropriate for the different types of crime studied. Importantly, the results are dependent on both the number of events in the data and the degree of spatial clustering, so a single ‘appropriate’ scale is not identified. The method is nevertheless useful as a means of better estimating what spatial scale might be appropriate for a particular piece of analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2953760938,"Voiding symptoms in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are driven by prostate smooth muscle contraction and prostate growth. Smooth muscle contraction in the prostate and other organs critically depends on activation of the small monomeric GTPase RhoA and probably Rac1. A role of another GTPase, ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), for smooth muscle contraction has been recently suggested by indirect evidence but remains to be proven for any organ. Here, we report effects of NAV2729, an inhibitor with assumed specificity for ARF6, in human prostate tissues and cultured prostate stromal cells (WPMY-1). NAV2729 (5 μm) inhibited neurogenic and α1-adrenergic contractions of human prostate tissues. Contractions induced by endothelin-1, by the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619, or by high molar KCl were not inhibited. Correlation analyses suggested up-regulation of prostatic ARF6 expression with increasing degree of BPH, as ARF6 expression increased with the content of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of prostate tissues. NAV2729 inhibited ARF6 activity but not other GTPases (ARF1, RhoA, Rac1) in prostate tissues and in WPMY-1 cells. Proliferation of WPMY-1 cells was inhibited concentration-dependently by NAV2726, as reflected by decreased viability, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, colony formation assay, and expression of Ki-67. Silencing of ARF6 expression mimicked effects of NAV2729 on viability and in the EdU assay. Effects of NAV2729 on viability and proliferation were attenuated in cells with silenced ARF6 expression. Our findings suggest that a NAV2729-sensitive mechanism promotes adrenergic contraction and stromal cell growth in the human prostate, which is probably ARF6-mediated.

https://openalex.org/W2955151671,"Three populations of Xiphinema primum n. sp. and two populations of X. pachtaicum were recovered from natural forests and cultural regions of northern Iran. Both species belong to the X. americanum-group and were characterized by their morphological, morphometric and molecular data. The new species, which was recovered in three locations, belongs to the X. brevicolle-complex and is characterized by 2124-2981 μm long females with a widely rounded lip region separated from the rest of the body by a depression, 103-125 μm long odontostyle, two equally developed genital branches with endosymbiont bacteria inside the ovary, which are visible under light microscope (LM), vulva located at 51.8-58.0%, the tail is 26-37 μm long with a bluntly rounded end and four juvenile developmental stages. It was morphologically compared with nine similar species viz. X. brevicolle, X. diffusum, X. incognitum, X. himalayense, X. luci, X. parabrevicolle, X. paramonovi, X. parataylori and X. taylori. The second species, X. pachtaicum, was recovered in two geographically distant points close to city of Amol. Molecular phylogenetic studies of the new species were performed using partial sequences of the D2-D3 expansion segments of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (LSU rDNA D2-D3), the internal-transcribed spacer rDNA (ITS = ITS1+5.8S+ITS2), and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI mtDNA) regions. The Iranian population of X. pachtaicum was also phylogenetically studied based upon its LSU rDNA D2-D3 sequences. Both species were also inspected for their putative endosymbiont bacteria. Candidatus Xiphinematobacter sp. was detected from two examined populations of the new species, whereas the second endosymbiont bacterium, detected from three examined isolates of X. pachtaicum, was related to the plant and fungal endosymbionts of the family Burkholderiaceae. The phylogenetic analyses of the two endosymbiont bacteria were performed using partial sequences of 16S rDNA. In cophylogenetic analyses, significant levels of cophylogenetic signal were observed using both LSU rDNA D2-D3 and COI mtDNA markers of the host nematodes and 16S rDNA marker of the endosymbiont bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2955060227,"Humans have a demonstrated tendency to copy or imitate the behavior and attitude of others and actively influence each other’s opinions. In plenty of empirical contexts, publicly revealed opinions are not necessarily in line with internal opinions, causing complex social influence dynamics. We study to what extent hypocrisy is sustained during opinion formation and how hidden opinions change the convergence to consensus in a group. We build and analyze a modified version of the voter model with hypocrisy in a complete graph with a neutral competition between two alternatives. We compare the process from various initial conditions, varying the proportions between the two opinions in the external (revealed) and internal (hidden) layer. According to our results, hypocrisy always prolongs the time needed for reaching a consensus. In a complete graph, this time span increases linearly with group size. We find that the group-level opinion emerges in two steps: (1) a fast and directional process, during which the number of the two kinds of hypocrites equalizes; and (2) a slower, random drift of opinions. During stage (2), the ratio of opinions in the external layer is approximately equal to the ratio in the internal layer; that is, the hidden opinions do not differ significantly from the revealed ones at the group level. We furthermore find that the initial abundances of opinions, but not the initial prevalence of hypocrisy, predicts the mean consensus time and determines the opinions’ probabilities of winning. These insights highlight the unimportance of hypocrisy in consensus formation under neutral conditions. Our results have important societal implications in relation to hidden voter preferences in polls and improve our understanding of opinion formation in a more realistic setting than that of conventional voter models."
https://openalex.org/W2955185989,"The unprecedented accessibility and affordability of online sexually explicit material (SEM) has facilitated widespread use among adolescents and growing concerns over adverse reproductive health outcomes. Although SEM-induced risky sexual behavior is among key concerns, there is a paucity of longitudinal research addressing this issue. This study aimed to assess the longitudinal association between frequency of SEM use and risky sexual behavior among adolescents in two independent 5-wave panel samples of Croatian adolescents (n = 368; n = 247). The indicators of risky sexual behavior were: (1) not using a condom at most recent sexual intercourse, and (2) reporting two or more sexual partners. Multilevel logistic regression analysis with a lagged component was used to explore the associations of interest. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, pubertal timing and sensation seeking, frequency of SEM use was not associated with the two indicators of sexual risk taking. This study’s findings are relevant for health and educational experts, but also for concerned parents."
https://openalex.org/W2955810979,"mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) are both involved in the development of obesity-linked insulin resistance. Recently, we showed that the S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 (PF) increases insulin sensitivity. However, we also reported that PF can increase glucose metabolism even in the absence of insulin in muscle and hepatic cells. Here we further explored the potential mechanisms by which PF increases glucose metabolism in muscle and liver cells independent of insulin. Time course experiments revealed that PF induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation before inhibiting S6K1. However, PF-induced glucose uptake was not prevented in primary muscle cells from AMPK α1/2 double KO (dKO) mice. Moreover, PF-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production was maintained in hepatocytes derived from AMPK α1/2-dKO mice. Remarkably, PF could still reduce glucose production and activate AMPK in hepatocytes from S6K1/2 dKO mice. Mechanistically, bioenergetics experiments revealed that PF reduces mitochondrial complex I activity in both muscle and hepatic cells. The stimulatory effect of PF on glucose uptake was partially reduced by expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase in L6 cells. These results indicate that PF-mediated S6K1 inhibition is not required for its effect on insulin-independent glucose metabolism and AMPK activation. We conclude that, although PF rapidly activates AMPK, its ability to acutely increase glucose uptake and suppress glucose production does not require AMPK activation. Unexpectedly, PF rapidly inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, a mechanism that partially underlies PF’s effect on glucose metabolism. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) are both involved in the development of obesity-linked insulin resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2954675341,"Cardiac disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for adult gorillas. Previous research indicates a sex-based difference with predominantly males demonstrating evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. To evaluate these findings, we analyzed serum markers with cardiac measures in a large sample of gorillas. The study sample included 44 male and 25 female gorillas housed at American Association of Zoo and Aquariums (AZA)-accredited zoos. Serum samples were collected from fasted gorillas during routine veterinary health exams and analyzed to measure leptin, adiponectin, IGF-1, insulin, ferritin, glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Cardiac ultrasonography via transthoracic echocardiogram was performed simultaneously. Three echocardiographic parameters were chosen to assess cardiac disease according to parameters established for captive lowland gorillas: left ventricular internal diameter, inter-ventricular septum thickness, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness. Our data revealed that high leptin, low adiponectin, and lowered cholesterol were significantly and positively correlated with measures of heart thickness and age in males but not in females. Lowered cholesterol in this population would be categorized as elevated in humans. High leptin and low adiponectin are indicative of increased adiposity and suggests a potential parallel with human obesity and cardiovascular disease in males. Interestingly, while females exhibited increased adiposity with age, they did not progress to cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2953453601,"Ticagrelor (TIC), a P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12)-receptor antagonist, has been widely used to treat patients with acute coronary syndrome. Although animal studies suggest that TIC protects against atherosclerosis, it remains unknown whether it does so through its potent platelet inhibition or through other pathways. Here, we placed hypercholesterolemic Ldlr-/-Apobec1-/- mice on a high-fat diet and treated them with either 25 mg/kg/day of clopidogrel (CLO) or 180 mg/kg/day of TIC for 16 weeks and evaluated the extent of atherosclerosis. Both treatments equally inhibited platelets as determined by ex vivo platelet aggregation assays. The extent of atherosclerosis, however, was significantly less in the TIC group than in the CLO group. Immunohistochemical staining and ELISA showed that TIC treatment was associated with less macrophage infiltration to the atherosclerotic intima and lower serum levels of CCL4, CXCL10, and TNFα, respectively, than CLO treatment. Treatment with TIC, but not CLO, was associated with higher serum activity and tissue level of paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an anti-atherosclerotic molecule, suggesting that TIC might exert greater anti-atherosclerotic activity, compared with CLO, through its unique ability to induce PON1. Although further studies are needed, TIC may prove to be a viable strategy in the prevention and treatment of chronic stable human atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2953549759,"Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is a critical innate immune signaling protein that directs the actions of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway of RNA virus recognition and initiation of anti-viral immunity against West Nile virus (WNV). In the absence of MAVS, mice die more rapidly after infection with the pathogenic WNV-Texas (TX) strain, but also produce elevated WNV-specific IgG concomitant with increased viral burden. Here we investigated whether there was a B cell intrinsic role for MAVS during the development of protective humoral immunity following WNV infection. MAVS-/- mice survived infection from the non-pathogenic WNV-Madagascar (MAD) strain, with limited signs of disease. Compared to wildtype (WT) controls, WNV-MAD-infected MAVS-/- mice had elevated serum neutralizing antibodies, splenic germinal center B cells, plasma cells and effector T cells. We found that when rechallenged with the normally lethal WNV-TX, MAVS-/- mice previously infected with WNV-MAD were protected from disease. Thus, protective humoral and cellular immune responses can be generated in absence of MAVS. Mice with a conditional deletion of MAVS only in CD11c+ dendritic cells phenocopied MAVS whole body knockout mice in their humoral responses to WNV-MAD, displaying elevated virus titers and neutralizing antibodies. Conversely, a B cell-specific deletion of MAVS had no effect on immune responses to WNV-MAD compared to WT controls. Thus, MAVS in dendritic cells is required to control WNV replication and thereby regulate downstream humoral immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2953834079,"Immunochemical techniques are the workhorse for sample enrichment and detection of a large variety of analytes. In contrast to classical microtiter plate-based assays, microparticles are a next generation solid support, as they promote automation of immunoassays using flow-based techniques. Antibody immobilization is a crucial step, as these reagents are expensive, and inefficient coupling can result in low sensitivities. This paper proposes a general procedure for efficient immobilization of antibodies onto TentaGel particles, via N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. The goal was the preparation of solid supports with optimum immunorecognition, while increasing the sustainability of the process. The influence of buffer composition, activation and coupling time, as well as the amount of antibody on the immobilization efficiency was investigated, resorting to fluorophore-labeled proteins and fluorescence imaging. Buffer pH and activation time are the most important parameters for efficient coupling. It is demonstrated, that the hydrolysis of N-hydroxysuccinimide esters occurs at similar rates as in solution, limiting the utilizable time for coupling. Finally, applicability of the generated material for automated affinity extraction is demonstrated on the mesofluidic platform lab-on-valve."
https://openalex.org/W2954039207,"In the past 20 years, free living populations of feral wild boar have re-established in several locations across the UK. One of the largest populations is in the Forest of Dean where numbers have been steadily increasing since monitoring began in 2008, with estimates from 2016 reporting a population of more than 1500. Feral wild boar have significant ecological and environmental impacts and may present a serious epidemiological risk to neighbouring livestock as they are a vector for a number of important livestock diseases. This includes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) which is currently absent from the UK. We developed an individual-based spatially explicit modelling approach to simulate feral wild boar populations in the Forest of Dean (England, UK) and use it to explore whether current or future populations might be sufficient to produce long-lived outbreaks of FMD in this potential wildlife reservoir. Our findings suggest that if you exclude the spread from feral wild boar to other susceptible species, the current population of boar is insufficient to maintain FMD, with 95% of unmanaged simulations indicating disease burn-out within a year (not involving boar management specifically for disease). However, if boar are allowed to spread beyond their current range into the adjacent landscape, they might maintain a self-sustaining reservoir of infection for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2953795194,"Introduction The rapid rise in trade and use of NPS and the lack of information concerning their potential toxicity pose serious challenges to public health authorities across the world. Policy measures towards NPS taken so far have a special focus on their legal status, while the implementation of a public health strategy seems to be still missing. The aim of this study is to perform a general assessment of NPS-related policy (including regulatory measures and public health strategies) implemented by six European countries: Portugal, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Methods Six EU countries were included in this scoping review study. Drug policies (including legal responses and public health strategies) were analysed. UNODC drug policy classification system was used as a benchmark, while path dependency approach was used for data analysis; a net of inter-dependencies between international, EU and national policies was highlighted. Results and discussion The countries included in this study can be placed in a wide spectrum according to their formulation of drug policy, from Portugal and the UK that have specific legal responses to NPS but have differently focused on harm reduction strategies at one end, to Sweden whose drug-free society goal is not translated into a specific regulation of NPS at the other end. Conclusion The findings of the study reveal limited development towards harmonisation of national drug policies–particularly with regard to NPS. To tackle the challenge presented by NPS, EU Member states have formulated legislation and public health strategies independently. National approaches to NPS are therefore in line with their already existing drug policies, reflecting cultural values towards substance abuse and national political interests, while the homogenization at an international level has so far mostly been focused on law enforcement and drugs use preventive strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2954070040,"During our studies on fungal diversity from plant substrates, a new species of Valsaria was isolated from dead branches of Ostrya carpinifolia. The taxon is morphologically similar to other taxa in Valsariaceae and is characterized by pseudostromata, apically free pseudoparaphyses, bitunicate asci, and dark brown, 2-celled ascospores. However, it differs from extant species in number of guttules and ornamentation of spore. It is introduced herein as Valsaria ostryae sp. nov. within the family Valsariaceae. Multigene phylogenies based on combined LSU, ITS and RPB2 DNA sequence data generated from maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and MrBayes analyses indicate that V. ostryae is basal to V. lopadostomoides and V. rudis and its establishment as a new species is strongly supported. No discordance was found between our morphological and phylogenetic species boundaries as postulated by other researchers and our molecular data strongly supports ornamentation of spore as useful for species delineation. Valsaria species do not appear to be host specific. Full morphological details are provided herein and phylogenetic relationships of Valsaria species are also discussed in light with host association."
https://openalex.org/W2955308757,"The World Health Organisation rotavirus surveillance networks have documented and shown eclectic geographic and temporal diversity in circulating G- and P- genotypes identified in children <5 years of age. To effectively monitor vaccine performance and effectiveness, robust molecular and phylogenetic techniques are essential to detect novel strain variants that might emerge due to vaccine pressure. This study inferred the phylogenetic history of the VP7 and VP4 genes of previously non-typeable strains and provided insight into the diversity of P[8] VP4 sequences which impacted the outcome of our routine VP4 genotyping method. Near-full-length VP7 gene and the VP8* fragment of the VP4 gene were obtained by Sanger sequencing and genotypes were determined using RotaC v2.0 web-based genotyping tool. The genotypes of the 57 rotavirus-positive samples with sufficient stool was determined. Forty-eight of the 57 (84.2%) had the P[8] specificity, of which 43 (89.6%) were characterized as P[8]a subtype and 5 (10.4%) as the rare OP354-like subtype. The VP7 gene of 27 samples were successfully sequenced and their G-genotypes confirmed as G1 (18/27) and G9 (9/27). Phylogenetic analysis of the P[8]a sequences placed them in subcluster IIIc within lineage III together with contemporary G1P[8], G3P[8], G8P[8], and G9P[8] strains detected globally from 2006–2016. The G1 VP7 sequences of the study strains formed a monophyletic cluster with African G1P[8] strains, previously detected in Ghana and Mali during the RotaTeq vaccine trial as well as Togo. The G9 VP7 sequences of the study strains formed a monophyletic cluster with contemporary African G9 sequences from neighbouring Burkina Faso within the major sub-cluster of lineage III. Mutations identified in the primer binding region of the VP8* sequence of the Ghanaian P[8]a strains may have resulted in the genotyping failure since the newly designed primer successfully genotyped the previously non-typeable P[8] strains. In summary, the G1, G9, and P[8]a sequences were highly similar to contemporary African strains at the lineage level. The study also resolved the methodological challenges of the standard genotyping techniques and highlighted the need for regular evaluation of the multiplex PCR-typing method especially in the post-vaccination era. The study further highlights the need for regions to start using sequencing data from local rotavirus strains to design and update genotyping primers."
https://openalex.org/W2955399237,"Phagocytosis of various targets, such as apoptotic cells or opsonized pathogens, by macrophages is coordinated by a complex signaling network initiated by distinct phagocytic receptors. Despite the different initial signaling pathways, each pathway ends up regulating the actin cytoskeletal network, phagosome formation and closure, and phagosome maturation leading to degradation of the engulfed particle. Herein, we describe a new phagocytic function for the nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 (NDK-1), the nematode counterpart of the first identified metastasis inhibitor NM23-H1 (nonmetastatic clone number 23) nonmetastatic clone number 23 or nonmetastatic isoform 1 (NME1). We reveal by coimmunoprecipitation, Duolink proximity ligation assay, and mass spectrometry that NDK-1/NME1 works in a complex with DYN-1/Dynamin (Caenorhabditis elegans/human homolog proteins), which is essential for engulf ment and phagosome maturation. Time-lapse microscopy shows that NDK-1 is expressed on phagosomal surfaces during cell corpse clearance in the same time window as DYN-1. Silencing of NM23-M1 in mouse bone marrow—derived macrophages resulted in decreased phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes. In human macrophages, NM23-H1 and Dynamin are corecruited at sites of phagosome formation in F-actin—rich cups. In addition, NM23-H1 was required for efficient phagocytosis. Together, our data demonstrate that NDK-1/NME1 is an evolutionarily conserved element of successful phagocytosis.—Farkas, Z., Petric, M., Liu, X., Herit, F., Rajnavölgyi, É., Szondy, Z., Budai, Z., Orbán, T.

https://openalex.org/W2955826594,"The considerably high evapotranspiration and the low leaching fraction of the soil in arid regions are likely the primary causes of the enhanced soil salinity in such regions. Winter irrigation has proven to be very effective for promoting the leaching of salts from the rooting-zone. In this study, we investigated the effects of different irrigation methods (flood irrigation and drip irrigation) and winter irrigation quotas (450, 1350, 2250, 3150, 4050, and 4950 m3/hm2) on soil salinity and plant growth in an arid region. The sum of ECe in the 0–100 cm soil layer was 56.26–29.32 ms/cm under flood irrigation, 61.37–17.90 ms/cm under drip irrigation, and 64.13 ms/cm under no irrigation. The survival rates of jujube trees reached 65% and 77%, respectively, for drip irrigation and flood irrigation with a quota of 2250 m3/hm2. Furthermore, at irrigation quotas in excess of 3150 m3/hm2 the ground diameter and height of jujube trees were significantly greater than those observed under nonwinter irrigation and several other winter irrigation treatments. These findings indicated that winter irrigation significantly reduced soil salinity, changed the soil salt distribution, created a good environment for the growth of jujube trees and improved the survival rate of young jujube trees, especially under winter drip irrigation with a quota of 3150 m3/hm2. In addition, 1-year-old jujube trees emerging in spring may benefit from an ECe lower than 5 ms/cm."
https://openalex.org/W2953491368,"It is crucial for agricultural production to identify the trigger that switches plants from vegetative to reproductive growth. Agricultural sustainability in semiarid regions is challenged by nitrogen (N) fertilizer overuse, inadequate soil water, and heavy carbon emissions. Previous studies focused on the short-term effects of a single application of N and water but have not investigated the long-term effects of different irrigation and N fertilizer regimens on crop yields and yield components. N application is routinely coupled with water availability, and crop yields can be maximized by optimizing both. We examined the growth of western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) Á. Löve], a temperate-region forage and turf grass, using multiple different combinations of N fertilizer [(NH4)2·CO3] and irrigation levels over 3 years to determine optimal field management. We conducted multifactorial, orthogonally designed field experiments with large sample sizes, and measured fertile tillers m-2 (Y1), spikelets/fertile tillers (Y2), florets/spikelet (Y3), seed numbers/spikelet (Y4), seed weight (Y5), and seed yield (Z) to study factors associated with the switch between vegetative and reproductive growth. Fertilization had a greater effect on seed yield and yield components than irrigation. Y1 had the strongest positive effect on Z, whereas Y5 had a negative effect on Z. Irrigation and fertilization affected Z, Y1, and Y5. Fertilizer concentrations were positively correlated with Z, Y1, and Y5, whereas irrigation levels were negatively correlated. The ridge regression linear model results suggested N application rate and irrigation had antagonistic effects on Y1 (X3 = 867.6–4.23×X2; R2 = 0.988, F = Infinity, P<0.0001). We conclude that the optimal amount of N fertilizer and irrigation was 156 kg ha-1 + 115 mm for seed yield, 120 kg ha-1 + 146 mm for spikelets/fertile tillers, and 108 kg ha-1 + 119 mm for seed numbers/spikelets. These results will improve yield and reduce agricultural inputs for P. smithii in semiarid and arid regions, thereby reducing fertilizer pollution and conserving water."
https://openalex.org/W2953562360,"In virtual reality, visual speed is usually underestimated relative to locomotor speed. Here we investigated how physical activity and fitness affect perceived visual speed when running in a treadmill-mediated virtual environment. Thirty healthy participants (ten sedentary individuals, ten team sport players and ten expert runners) ran on a treadmill at two different speeds (8, 12km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. Participants were asked to match the speed of the visual scene to their running speed (i.e. treadmill speed), indicating for each trial whether the scene was moving slower or faster than the treadmill. The speed of the visual scene was adjusted according to the participant’s response using a staircase until visual and running speeds were perceived as equivalent. More sedentary participants underestimated visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Specifically, visual speed had to exceed running speed to be perceived as equivalent. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and it was significantly larger for sedentary participants than for team sports players and expert runners. The volume of physical activity per week was found to be the best predictor of visual speed perception for both running speeds, while the perceived effort constituted a good predictor only at 8km/h. Physical fitness, on the other hand turned out to be a poor predictor of visual speed perception. Therefore, in order to enhance users’ engagement and their adherence to physical activity programs, the development of “personalized” treadmill-mediated virtual environments should take into account users’ personal characteristics to provide the most natural and engaging feedback possible."
https://openalex.org/W2953722433,"The diploid genotypes of males are widely thought to determine sperm phenotypes, yet recent work shows that the haploid genetics of the individual sperm cell also contributes significantly. We tested seven sperm phenotypes, flagellar length and six behaviors, looking for correlations between genetic and phenotypic variability. While flagellar length appears to be controlled by the diploid genotype of the source, variation in three of the behavioral phenotypes, linearity, wobble, and progression are significantly correlated with the heterozygosity of the male producer. Because males that are more genetically variable produce a sperm set that is more diverse in its haploid genotypes, we suggest that the correlations may reflect significant haploid genetic control of sperm swimming behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2955770887,"Anecdotal reports of horses opening fastened doors and gates are an intriguing way of exploring the possible scope of horses’ problem-solving capacities. The species’ natural environment has no analogues of the mechanisms involved. Scientific studies on the topic are missing, because the rate of occurrence is too low for exploration under controlled conditions. Therefore, we compiled from lay persons case reports of horses opening closed doors and gates. Additionally, we collected video documentations at the internet platform YouTube, taking care to select raw data footage of unedited, clearly described and clearly visible cases of animals with no distinct signs of training or reduced welfare. The data included individuals opening 513 doors or gates on hinges, 49 sliding doors, and 33 barred doors and gateways; mechanisms included 260 cases of horizontal and 155 vertical bars, 43 twist locks, 42 door handles, 34 electric fence handles, 40 carabiners, and 2 locks with keys. Opening was usually for escape, but also for access to food or stable-mates, or out of curiosity or playfulness. While 56 percent of the horses opened a single mechanism at one location, 44 percent opened several types of mechanism (median = 2, min. = 1, max. = 5) at different locations (median = 2, min. = 1, max. = 4). The more complex the mechanism was, the more movements were applied, varying from median 2 for door handles to 10 for carabiners. Mechanisms requiring head- or lip-twisting needed more movements, with significant variation between individuals. 74 horses reported in the questionnaire had options for observing the behaviour in stable mates, 183 did not, which indicates that the latter learned to open doors and gates either individually or from observing humans. Experience favours opening efficiency; subjects which opened several door types applied fewer movements per lock than horses which opened only one door type. We failed to identify a level of complexity of door-fastening mechanism that was beyond the learning capacity of the horse to open. Thus, all devices in frequent use, even carabiners and electric fence handles, are potentially vulnerable to opening by horses, something which needs to be considered in relation to keeping horses safely."
https://openalex.org/W2954373525,"Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the presence of pathogens in the blood. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and has to be treated promptly as mortality increases with every hour of delayed treatment. Therefore, rapid and sensitive diagnosis of BSI is essential. The routine diagnostic method for BSI is blood culture, which can only detect culturable pathogens and takes several days to obtain results. The 16S rRNA gene is present in all bacteria and is commonly used as a target for universal bacterial detection in rapid molecular assays such as PCR. However, molecular detection of the 16S gene is hampered by the large amount of human DNA found in blood samples, making diagnostic results aspecific and less sensitive. We have optimized the selection of PCR primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene to avoid cross-reaction with human DNA background. The developed method increases specificity and sensitivity for pathogen diagnosis, and provides rapid and accurate pathogen detection for rare bacterial DNA in the presence of abundant host DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2955022193,"The fundamental biological function of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) is to catalyze the reversible exchange of the γ-phosphate between nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) and nucleoside diphosphate (NDP). This kinase also has functions that extend beyond its canonically defined enzymatic role as a phosphotransferase. However, the role of NDK in filamentous fungi, especially in Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus), is not yet known. Here we report that A. flavus has two NDK-encoding gene copies as assessed by qPCR. Using gene-knockout and complementation experiments, we found that AfNDK regulates spore and sclerotia development and is involved in plant virulence as assessed in corn and peanut seed-based assays. An antifungal test with the inhibitor azidothymidine suppressed AfNDK activity in vitro and prevented spore production and sclerotia formation in A. flavus, confirming AfNDK's regulatory functions. Crystallographic analysis of AfNDK, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis experiments, revealed three residues (Arg-104, His-117, and Asp-120) as key sites that contribute to spore and sclerotia development. These results not only enrich our knowledge of the regulatory role of this important protein in A. flavus, but also provide insights into the prevention of A. flavus infection in plants and seeds, as well as into the structural features relevant for future antifungal drug development."

Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) has invaded many regions in China, causing enormous ecological and economic losses. We aimed to explore the trend and potential of diffusion by researching the thermal survival limits of S. noctilio. We measured the supercooling point (SCP), critical thermal temperature (CTmax), high lethal temperature (HLT) and low lethal temperature (LLT) for S. noctilio population in China and assessed life stage-related variation in thermal tolerance. Moreover, we determined the temperature tolerance range of S. noctilio and identified the temperature parameters for its potential invasive distribution risk analysis. The SCP of adults was -11.78 ± 0.67 (mean ± SEM), the CTmax was 37.67 ± 0.54, and those of larvae were -20.77 ± 0.44 and 40.53 ± 0.27, respectively. The LLT increased with exposure time, and the HLT was generally near 43°C. S. noctilio adults can tolerate higher temperatures than larvae, and the larvae showed high resistance to cold temperature. We calculated several temperature indexes based on our results, such as the lower temperature threshold (DV0) at -2.7°C, the upper temperature threshold (DV3) at 31°C, the temperature threshold for both heat stress (TTHS) at 35°C and cold stress (TTCS) at -32.5°C. We observed that, S. noctilio was not resistant to high temperatures, its CTmax is slightly lower than the lethal temperature, and the adults were more tolerant than larvae. Our next goal was to combine the temperature tolerance of symbiotic fungi, information on climate change and the current distribution of this species to predict its potential global distribution."

Liver biochemistry data, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHVD), acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and scores of Pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire (PedsQL) were collected.All the enrolled 33 PKBA patients (36.4% males), aged 1-23 years, possessed 25-OHVD less than 30ng/ml. An inverse correlation was detected between serum 25-OHVD and ARFI (r2 = 0.175; p = 0.024). We selected a cutoff value of 23ng/mL to divide PKBA patients into two groups, as the p-value was the most significant at this point when comparing the median ARFI of two groups (p = 0.003). Ten (30.3%) had 25-OHVD≥23ng/ml (HVD group), whereas 23(69.7%) had 25-OHVD<23ng/ml (LVD group).

Stable plaques yielded more cells than vulnerable ones. Plaque cell cultures also contained several morphological cellular types. RNA-seq profiles of plaque cells were different from any of the cell types known to be involved in atherogenesis. The expression of the following proteins was observed in cultured plaque cells: smooth muscle cells marker α-SMA, macrophage marker CD14, extracellular matrix proteins aggrecan, fibronectin, neovascularisation markers VEGF-A, CD105, cellular adhesion receptor CD31 and progenitor/dedifferentiation receptor CD34. Differential expression of several notable transcripts in cells from stable and vulnerable plaques suggests the value of plaque cell culture studies for the search of plaque vulnerability markers."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk of developing SSNHL among patients with dysrhythmia in different age and gender groups by using population-based data in Taiwan. Methods We conducted a matched cohort study by analyzing data between January 2000 and December 2013 obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. 41,842 newly diagnosed dysrhythmia patients and 83,684 comparison subjects without dysrhythmia were selected from claims. The incidence of sudden sensorineural hearing loss at the end of 2013 was determined in both groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the risk of SSNHL among patients with dysrhythmia. Results The incidence of SSNHL was 1.30-fold higher in the dysrhythmia group compared with the control group (53.2 versus 40.9 per 100,000 person-years), and using Cox proportional hazard regressions, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–1.70). Gender-stratified analysis revealed a significantly higher risk of SSNHL in patients with dysrhythmia than in those without dysrhythmia for both men and women (HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.02–1.76, P = 0.039, HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02–1.78, P = 0.035, respectively). Age-stratified analysis revealed remarkable associations between dysrhythmia and SSNHL among those aged less than 40 years and more than 65 years (HR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.03–4.64, P = 0.043 and HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.14–2.09, P = 0.006, respectively). Conclusions Our findings support dysrhythmia as an independent risk factor for SSNHL. Based on the study results, clinicians managing patients with dysrhythmia should be aware of the increased risk of developing SSNHL, especially among patients aged <40 and >65 years, and counsel patients to seek medical advice immediately if they experience any acute change in their hearing ability."
https://openalex.org/W2954559800,"Our recent single-cell transcriptomic analysis has demonstrated that heterogeneous transcriptional activity attends molecular transition from the nascent to terminally differentiated fiber cells in the developing mouse lens. To understand the role of transcriptional heterogeneity in terminal differentiation and the functional phenotype (transparency) of this tissue, here we present a single-cell analysis of the developing lens, in a transgenic paradigm of an inherited pathology, known as the lamellar cataract. Cataracts hinder transmission of light into the eye. Lamellar cataract is the most prevalent bilateral childhood cataract. In this disease of early infancy, initially, the opacities remain confined to a few fiber cells, thus presenting an opportunity to investigate early molecular events that lead to cataractogenesis. We used a previously established paradigm that faithfully recapitulates this disease in transgenic mice. About 500 single fiber cells, manually isolated from a 2-day-old transgenic lens were interrogated individually for the expression of all known 17 crystallins and 78 other relevant genes using a Biomark HD (Fluidigm). We find that fiber cells from spatially and developmentally discrete regions of the transgenic (cataract) lens show remarkable absence of the heterogeneity of gene expression. Importantly, the molecular variability of cortical fiber cells, the hallmark of the WT lens, is absent in the transgenic cataract, suggesting absence of specific cell-type(s).

This molecular dysfunction portends pathology much before the physical manifestations of the disease. The functional phenotype of the ocular lens is transmission of focused light into the eye. This physical phenotype is the culmination of a coordinated orchestration of gene activity and morphogenesis, which in the adult lens commences in the edges (equator) of the epithelium that covers the anterior face of the lens (1Bassnett S.

Differentiation produces long, elongated fiber cells, which are layered one over the other in an ordered and temporally regulated fashion. The youngest fiber cells, therefore, are on the outside, whereas the oldest, terminally differentiated cells are inside, in the center of the lens. The fiber cells thus constitute >95% of the volume of the adult lens, in which the oldest terminally differentiated fiber cells, in the middle, make the visual axis. Notably, the differentiation of fiber cells, from the epithelial cells, is attended by high expression of crystallins, proteins that generate transparency (2Andley U.P.

Analysis of these fiber cells, representing different regions/states of differentiation, revealed that the cortical fiber cells that connect the equatorial and the nuclear regions were transcriptionally highly variable. Importantly, a specific group of crystallin genes show coordinated increase in their expression in the fiber cells derived from the nuclear region of the lens (7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K.

It is unclear whether molecular heterogeneity at the single cell level is relevant to the realization of the functional phenotype of a tissue. Here we present our findings, working with a transgenic paradigm of an inherited childhood cataract to address this question. Cataract is a disease of the ocular lens where the fiber cells, instead of remaining transparent, become opaque, which inhibits light transmission. Because, in the ocular lens, the functional phenotype of fiber cells is transparency and the disease phenotype is a cataract (opacification), it would be meaningful to examine the status of transcriptional heterogeneity (which is characteristic of the WT transparent fiber cells) (7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K. Mangul S. Zhou X. Elashoff D. Bhat S.P.

For these investigations, we have used the transgenic model of a genetic cataract known as the lamellar cataract. Lamellar cataract is the most prevalent inherited childhood cataract (16Falls H.F.

The disease appears in the postnatal lens as cataracts (opacities) in a spatially restricted area in a single or a few fiber cells (or lamellae) (Fig. 1) (19Gangalum R.K. Jing Z. Bhat A.M. Lee J.

Here we investigate this unique paradigm at the single-cell level in a developing mouse lens genetically predisposed to cataractogenesis (Fig. 1B). We worked with the postnatal 2-day-old (PND02) transgenic mutant lens, which allows us to probe early molecular changes, much before the cataract pathology is visible after the eyes open (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1A shows the lens at postnatal day 25 (PND25) where the cataracts are visible. The transgenic lens looks like a normal WT lens in its overall morphology. The pathology (cataract) is visible only in a few fiber cells (Fig. 1A, schematic) whereas the rest of the lens looks normal. Although the mutant lens physiognomy looks normal, a cross section of the lens at PND02 reveals the persistence of nuclei (Fig. 1B, cataract PND02), an abnormal phenotype, known to be associated with the loss of Hsf4 gene activity (21Fujimoto M.

Note that in the WT lens, the fiber cell nuclei are organized in a “bow” at the equator (Fig. 1B, WT PND02). About 500 fiber cells, from five different transgenic lenses were manually isolated following the procedures established previously (7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K. Mangul S. Zhou X. Elashoff D.

These fiber cells represent three different regions and, therefore, three different states of differentiation (equatorial, cortical, and nuclear, indicated by red, green, and blue bars, respectively, in Fig. 1B). Each fiber cell was interrogated for the expression of 95 genes (including 17 crystallins and 78 noncrystallins; Table S1), just as was done previously with the WT lens fiber cells (7Gangalum R.K.

Our recent work with single fiber cells isolated from three different regions of the WT PND02 mouse lens revealed the existence of a population of cortical fiber cells, which show very poor expression of crystallins but high expression of noncrystallin genes (7Gangalum R.K.

These cells contribute >80% of the transcriptional variability in isolated single fiber cells of the WT lens. Fig. 2, A and B show unsupervised clustering of the gene expression data obtained from single fiber cells, isolated from one transgenic lamellar cataract lens and one WT lens, respectively. It is evident that a group of cortical fibers which show poor crystallin expression but high noncrystallin expression (Fig. 2B, dotted oval) are absent in the transgenic lens (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2C shows a cumulative analysis of the data obtained from five lenses (460 fiber cells in all, 92 fiber cells from each lens), confirming what we see in the data derived from one lens (Fig. 2A). In fact, the data presented in Fig. 2C for the transgenic lens are directly comparable with the data published for the five WT lenses (7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K. Mangul S. Zhou X. Elashoff D. Bhat S.P. Spatial analysis of single fiber cells of the developing ocular lens reveals regulated heterogeneity of gene expression.iScience. 2018; 10 (30508719): 66-7910.1016/j.isci.2018.11.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2C, we can recognize three predominant groups of cells that express crystallins and noncrystallins at variable levels (arrowheads 1–3). There is a group of fiber cells, which express crystallins as well as the noncrystallins at high levels (arrowhead 1); a group of fiber cells at an intermediate level (arrowhead 2); and a group of fiber cells which show poor expression of most of the genes (extreme left columns of Fig. 2C, arrowhead 3). The expression pattern in Fig. 2C suggests general uniformity with respect to the expression of genes all across the 460 fiber cells; we do not see fiber cell(s) with specific expression of a gene(s). This is a remarkable departure from the data obtained previously with the WT lens fiber cells, where various fiber cells can be characterized based on the expression of a specific gene(s) (7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K. Mangul S. Zhou X. Elashoff D. Bhat S.P. Spatial analysis of single fiber cells of the developing ocular lens reveals regulated heterogeneity of gene expression.iScience. 2018; 10 (30508719): 66-7910.1016/j.isci.2018.11.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A closer examination of the data in Fig. 2C shows a fiber cell with very low crystallin expression and high noncrystallin expression (magnified image on the right). We traced this fiber cell to the data from cortical fiber cells (Fig. S2), which suggests that this is a rare normal fiber cell in the mutant lens. In fact, in the WT lens 29% of the cortical fiber cells show low crystallin but high noncrystallin gene expression (7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K. Mangul S. Zhou X. Elashoff D. Bhat S.P. Spatial analysis of single fiber cells of the developing ocular lens reveals regulated heterogeneity of gene expression.iScience. 2018; 10 (30508719): 66-7910.1016/j.isci.2018.11.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This group of cells is absent in the transgenic lens fiber cells (Fig. 2, A and C). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptional activity of 95 genes in 460 fiber cells of the transgenic lens shows three top clusters (Fig. 3A). Notably, all of the clusters are composed of mixed populations of cells (red, green, and blue representing equatorial, cortical, and nuclear fiber cells, respectively). Similar analysis in the WT fiber cells produced five clusters. Of these, there were at least two clusters of fiber cells which were predominantly composed of cells spatially traceable to either cortical or nuclear regions (7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K. Mangul S. Zhou X. Elashoff D. Bhat S.P. Spatial analysis of single fiber cells of the developing ocular lens reveals regulated heterogeneity of gene expression.iScience. 2018; 10 (30508719): 66-7910.1016/j.isci.2018.11.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Analysis of the data (Fig. 3A) from the mutant (transgenic) fiber cells reveals that there are no clusters which represent a specific region or an absence or presence of one gene activity. Cluster 1 (n = 187 cells) generates >88% variation in these data and is composed of 58, 58, and 71 fiber cells from the equatorial, cortical, and nuclear regions, respectively. The other two clusters are not very different in their spatial derivations. Fig. 3, C–E presents violin plots (probabilistic distributions of various populations of cells based on expression) of all 17 crystallins (the data for all 95 genes are presented in Fig. S3, A–C). All three clusters contain cells which express most crystallins at high levels (Fig. 3, C–E). There are differences, however: Cluster 3 differs from the first two clusters in that it shows low expression of Cryba2 and Crybg3 (Fig. 3E, arrows). The presence of most crystallin transcripts at high concentrations in all clusters suggests unusual uniformity of crystallin expression (PCA loading plots are presented in Fig. S3, D and E). Fig. 3, F–H presents a gene-by-gene comparison of the expression profile of all 95 genes in the fiber cells from different regions of the transgenic lens (equatorial versus cortical, equatorial versus nuclear, and cortical versus nuclear, respectively). These data demonstrate similar gene activities in the fiber cells from the equatorial, cortical, and nuclear regions establishing the absence of molecular transitions between different regions in the transgenic lens. Analysis of differential gene activity in various regions of the WT transparent lens reveals that of the 94 genes, there are 75 genes differentially expressed between the equatorial and the cortical fibers and 82 genes between the cortical and the nuclear fibers (Fig. 4A, WT). In comparison, in the fiber cells from the transgenic lens (Fig. 4A, cataract), the corresponding numbers are 5 and 1, respectively. This is further corroborated by scatter plots presented in Fig. 4B (see also volcano plots in Fig. S4, showing absence of differential gene activity). These gene expression data are also supported by the similarity of the violin plots and the corresponding box plots of gene expression in fiber cells from all three regions, suggesting that there are similar cell populations or cell-types all across the developing transgenic lens (Fig. S5, A–C). One of the landmarks of the developing WT lens is the high transcriptional heterogeneity in the fiber cells derived from the cortex (7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K. Mangul S. Zhou X. Elashoff D. Bhat S.P. Spatial analysis of single fiber cells of the developing ocular lens reveals regulated heterogeneity of gene expression.iScience. 2018; 10 (30508719): 66-7910.1016/j.isci.2018.11.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is in this context, therefore, that the absence of variation in the expression of crystallin and noncrystallin genes in the fiber cells of the transgenic lens is striking (Fig. 5, B and D). The WT lens cortical fiber cells show highest variation, both in crystallins as well as in noncrystallin gene expression (Fig. 5, A and C, green). These data augment the apparent uniformity of cellular population distributions seen above in the PCA clusters and lack of differential gene activity (Figs. 3, F–H, and 4). There is appreciable increase in the noncrystallin gene activity in the cortical fiber cells in the WT lens; this activity obviously is highly variable (Fig. 5C and Ref. 7Gangalum R.K. Kim D. Kashyap R.K. Mangul S. Zhou X. Elashoff D. Bhat S.P. Spatial analysis of single fiber cells of the developing ocular lens reveals regulated heterogeneity of gene expression.iScience. 2018; 10 (30508719): 66-7910.1016/j.isci.2018.11.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Comparison of the noncrystallin activity in the WT and transgenic lens, however, reveals that decrease in the variability of expression in the cortical fiber cells in the transgenic lens is also accompanied by quantitatively lower transcriptional activity (Fig. 5, compare C and D). Fig. 6 presents a panoramic view of the 95 gene activities across the landscape of individual fiber cells in the WT PND02 lens (Fig. 6, A and C) and in the transgenic (cataract) lens (Fig. 6, E and G). In the WT, these data reveal a pattern that is interrupted by large variations in gene activity, be it the crystallins (Fig. 6A, open arrowheads) or the noncrystallins (Fig. 6C, open arrowheads). Note that in Fig. 6A, the medians (red, green, and blue dots), which are close to x axis (open arrowheads) indicate poor/absence of crystallin expression. The same fiber cells, however, show high noncrystallin gene expression (Fig. 6C, open arrowheads). Note that in the WT, about 75% of the cortical fiber cells (green) express crystallins at (log2) ≥ 10 (Fig. 6B). In the same region about 29% of cells show high noncrystallin expression (log2) ≥ 10 whereas the equatorial and nuclear fiber cells (red and blue bars, respectively) show much lower levels (Fig. 6D). These large variations in expression from region to region are absent in the fiber cells of the transgenic (cataract) lens (Fig. 6, F and H). Interestingly, however, the transgenic fiber cells show a repetitive pattern of gene activity, both among crystallins (Fig. 6E) as well as in noncrystallins (Fig. 6G). The repetitive patterns of gene activity result in the absence of finding specific gene activities that may be coordinated and/or represent specific fiber cells or regions within the developing lens. For example, the data in Fig. 7, A and B shows Pearson correlation plots of gene expression in the WT (Fig. 7A) and in the transgenic (cataract) fiber cells (Fig. 7B). Although everything seems to be uniformly correlated in the cataract fiber cells (Fig. 7B), there are specific correlations evident in the WT fiber cells, the prominent one being the nine crystallin genes (Fig. 7A, top right) and their inverse correlation with the noncrystallin activity in the rest of the fiber cells (Fig. 7A, blue). Note that in the fiber cells of the transgenic cataract, Cryaa and the eight crystallins are not as coordinated (Fig. 7B, top right) as in the WT (Fig. 7A). The data in Fig. 7, A and B represent all genes in about 460 fiber cells of the WT and the transgenic lens, respectively. In Fig. 7, C and D, we compare only the expression of crystallin genes in the WT and transgenic fiber cells. In the WT lens (Fig. 7C), the expression of crystallins in cortical fiber cells (green) is highly variable (mostly in the lower quartile, whereas the median is skewed up, green boxes. The expression profiles in the fiber cells of the transgenic lens (Fig. 7D) from all regions (red, green, and blue) are uniform and with rather compact distributions indicating absence of heterogeneity. The variability of noncrystallin genes is also high in the cortical fiber cells in the WT than in the transgenic lens (see box plots presented"
https://openalex.org/W2955404886,"We reveal by high-throughput screening that activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) is a novel pluripotent regulator in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The knockdown of ATF1 expression significantly up-regulated neuroectoderm (NE) genes but not mesoderm, endoderm, and trophectoderm genes. Of note, down-regulation or knockout of ATF1 with short hairpin RNA (shRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) was sufficient to up-regulate sex-determining region Y-box (SOX)2 and paired box 6 (PAX6) expression under the undifferentiated or differentiated conditions, whereas overexpression of ATF1 suppressed NE differentiation. Endogenous ATF1 was spontaneously down-regulated after d 1–3 of neural induction. By double-knockdown experiments, up-regulation of SOX2 was critical for the increase of PAX6 and SOX1 expression in shRNA targeting Atf1 hESCs. Using the luciferase reporter assay, we identified ATF1 as a negative transcriptional regulator of Sox2 gene expression. A novel function of ATF1 was discovered, and these findings contribute to a broader understanding of the very first steps in regulating NE differentiation in hESCs.—Yang, S.-C, Liu, J.-J., Wang, C.-K., Lin, Y.-T., Tsai, S.-Y., Chen, W.-J., Huang, W.-K., Tu, P.-W.

https://openalex.org/W2954374645,"An intriguing simple toy, commonly known as the Notched Stick, is discussed as an example of a “vibrot”, a device designed and built to yield conversion of mechanical vibrations into a rotational motion. The toy, that can be briefly described as a propeller fixed on a stick by means of a nail and free to rotate around it, is investigated from both an experimental and a numerical point of view, under various conditions and settings, to investigate the basic working principles of the device. The conversion efficiency from vibration to rotational motion turns out to be very small, or even not detectable at all, whenever the propeller is tightly connected to the stick nail and perfectly axisymmetrical with respect to the nail axis; the small effects possibly observed can be ascribed to friction forces. In contrast, the device succeeds in converting vibrations into rotations when the propeller center of mass is not aligned with the nail axis, a condition occurring when either the nail-propeller coupling is not tight or the propeller is not completely axisymmetrical relative to the nail axis. The propeller rotation may be induced by a process of parametric resonance for purely vertical oscillations of the nail, by ordinary resonance if the nail only oscillates horizontally or, finally, by a combination of both processes when nail oscillations take place in an intermediate direction. Parametric resonance explains the onset of rotations also when the weight of the propeller is negligible. In contrast with what is commonly claimed in the literature, the possible elliptical motion of the nail, due to a composition of two harmonic motions of the same frequency imposed along orthogonal directions, seems unnecessary to determine the propeller rotation."
https://openalex.org/W2955115721,"Hemangioblastoma (HB) is an abnormal intracranial buildup of blood vessels that exhibit a great potential for hemorrhage. Surgical options are limited, and few medications are available for treatment. We show here by immunohistochemical analysis that HB lesions display highly increased levels of VEGF expression and macrophage/microglia infiltration compared with those in normal brain tissues. In the meantime, TNF superfamily 15 (TNFSF15) (also known as vascular endothelial growth inhibitor), an antiangiogenic cytokine, is highly expressed in normal brain blood vessels but diminished in HB lesions. We set up a brain hemangioma model by using mouse bEnd.3 cells of a T antigen-transformed endothelial cell line that produce a large amount of VEGF. When implanted in mouse brains, these cells form lesions that closely resemble the pathologic characteristics of HB. Retroviral infection of bEnd.3 cells with TNFSF15 leads to inhibition of VEGF production and retardation of hemangioma formation. Similar results are obtained when wild-type bEnd.3 cells are implanted in the brains of transgenic mice overexpressing TNFSF15. Additionally, TNFSF15 treatment results in enhanced pericyte coverage of the blood vessels in the lesions together with reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and decreased hemorrhage. These findings indicate that the ability of TNFSF15 to counterbalance the abnormally highly angiogenic and inflammatory potential of the microenvironment of HB is of therapeutic value for the treatment of this disease.-Yang, G.-L., Han, Z., Xiong, J., Wang, S., Wei, H., Qin, T.-T., Xiao, H., Liu, Y., Xu, L.-X., Qi, J.-W., Zhang, Z.-S., Jiang, R., Zhang, J., Li, L.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2955590943,"Detection of human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in nasopharyngeal swab samples by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) will be valuable for diagnosing HAdV infection, which is a leading cause of severe respiratory tract disease, and will help in curbing the spread of HAdV. Monoclonal antibodies employed in IFA for HAdV detection should ideally target highly conserved epitope types. Here, we describe the development of two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) with specific reactivity to HAdV using phage antibody library technology. When tested with IFA, both Fabs recognized cells infected with several types of HAdV, some of which have been identified in epidemics globally, or associated with outbreaks of severe or fatal acute respiratory diseases. The specificity and cross-reactivity of both Fabs to HAdVs indicated that the generated Fabs could be applied in the development of IFAs to detect HAdVs. Both Fabs bound to the knob proteins, as shown by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay and western blot. In addition, epitope mapping showed that both Fabs recognized a conserved linear epitope among several types of HAdV. Two different Fabs recognized the same epitope, suggesting that the epitope triggered the production of at least two kinds of antibodies in the body. The generated Fabs exerted no neutralization against HAdVs. The results demonstrate that both Fabs bind to an epitope that plays no role in neutralization of HAdV."
https://openalex.org/W2956112927,"Dugout canoes are boats made from a single tree trunk. Even with the modernization of fishing, they are still made and used for artisanal fishing on the coast of southern and southeastern Brazil and in other regions of the world. Various tree species are used to construct these canoes and choosing a species is related to characteristics of the location, available raw materials and purpose of the boat. Our objective was to better understand the variation in dugout canoes in relation to tree species, tree size and fishing use, over time, along a coastal strip of southern and southeastern Brazil within the Atlantic Forest domain. We interviewed 53 artisans and analyzed 358 canoes that ranged from 1 to around 200 years old. Schizolobium parahyba is currently used the most. In the past, species of the family Lauraceae (Nectandra sp. / Ocotea sp.) were frequently used, as well as Cedrela fissilis and Ficus sp. The size of the canoes varied based on time, coastal region, environment where the boat is used (exposed or sheltered) and type of fishing. The average size of recent canoes was smaller than older canoes for more common species (S. parahyba and C. fissilis), reflecting changes in the vegetation of the biome over time, both in the species and size of individuals available. Latitudinal variation can also influence the availability of tree species along the studied regions. An increase in environmental monitoring has contributed to a decline in constructing dugout canoes, resulting in the use of fiberglass canoes and other motorized boats. Although canoe size varied based on region, location and use, today some of the older canoes represent large trees of the past and pieces of Atlantic Forest history."
