https://openalex.org/W2073610802,"The premature ageing disorder Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic condition characterized by a rapid onset of signs associated with normal ageing, such as atherosclerosis and the degeneration of vascular smooth-muscle cells. Liu et al. report that the altered structure of the nuclear envelope and epigenetic modifications that accumulate during physiological ageing or under specific disease conditions can be restored to normalcy by reprogramming somatic cell lines established with fibroblasts from patients with HGPS as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Directed differentiation of the resulting iPS cells as vascular smooth-muscle cells then leads to the appearance of the premature senescence phenotypes associated with vascular ageing. This HGPS iPS cell model provides a way to study the mechanisms regulating premature and normal ageing in vitro. Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare and fatal human premature ageing disease1,2,3,4,5, characterized by premature arteriosclerosis and degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs)6,7,8. HGPS is caused by a single point mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene, resulting in the generation of progerin, a truncated splicing mutant of lamin A. Accumulation of progerin leads to various ageing-associated nuclear defects including disorganization of nuclear lamina and loss of heterochromatin9,10,11,12. Here we report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts obtained from patients with HGPS. HGPS-iPSCs show absence of progerin, and more importantly, lack the nuclear envelope and epigenetic alterations normally associated with premature ageing. Upon differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs, progerin and its ageing-associated phenotypic consequences are restored. Specifically, directed differentiation of HGPS-iPSCs to SMCs leads to the appearance of premature senescence phenotypes associated with vascular ageing. Additionally, our studies identify DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNAPKcs, also known as PRKDC) as a downstream target of progerin. The absence of nuclear DNAPK holoenzyme correlates with premature as well as physiological ageing. Because progerin also accumulates during physiological ageing6,12,13, our results provide an in vitro iPSC-based model to study the pathogenesis of human premature and physiological vascular ageing."

We constructed chimeric proteins and mutants to address the protein region that specifies which reactive oxygen species is produced. Reactive oxygen species were measured with luminol/horseradish peroxidase and Amplex Red for H2O2 versus L-012 and cytochrome c for O2̇̄. The third extracytosolic loop (E-loop) of Nox4 is 28 amino acids longer than that of Nox1 or Nox2. Deletion of E-loop amino acids only present in Nox4 or exchange of the two cysteines in these stretches switched Nox4 from H2O2 to O2̇̄ generation while preserving expression and intracellular localization. In the presence of an NO donor, the O2̇̄-producing Nox4 mutants, but not wild-type Nox4, generated peroxynitrite, excluding artifacts of the detection system as the apparent origin of O2̇̄. In Cos7 cells, in which Nox4 partially localizes to the plasma membrane, an antibody directed against the E-loop decreased H2O2 but increased O2̇̄ formation by Nox4 without affecting Nox1-dependent O2̇̄ formation. The E-loop of Nox4 but not Nox1 and Nox2 contains a highly conserved histidine that could serve as a source for protons to accelerate spontaneous dismutation of superoxide to form H2O2. Mutation of this but not of four other conserved histidines also switched Nox4 from H2O2 to O2̇̄ formation. Thus, H2O2 formation is an intrinsic property of Nox4 that involves its E-loop. The structure of the E-loop may hinder O2̇̄ egress and/or provide a source for protons, allowing dismutation to form H2O2.

The structure of the E-loop may hinder O2̇̄ egress and/or provide a source for protons, allowing dismutation to form H2O2. The class of Nox protein NADPH oxidases is a group of enzymes whose sole known function is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 2The abbreviation used is: ROS, reactive oxygen species. The enzyme family is named for the enzymatically active transmembrane protein Nox. All seven Nox proteins share highly conserved structural features; the C-terminal dehydrogenase domain contains binding sites for FAD and NADPH. The N-terminal transmembrane region consists of six α-helical transmembrane domains that contain four conserved histidine residues, located in the third and fifth transmembrane helices that coordinate two hemes. Electron transfer occurs from NADPH to oxygen via FAD and the two heme groups, with the second heme group reducing molecular oxygen (1Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4908) Google Scholar, 2Vignais P.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1428-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Because heme is an obligate 1-electron donor, it is generally accepted that the superoxide anion (O2̇̄) is the initial reduction product of oxygen, although the latter can also react with a second O2̇̄ to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plus oxygen. Despite these similarities, Nox proteins differ in their mode of activation, their interaction with the small transmembrane protein p22phox, and the requirement for additional maturation and activation factors. The most extensively studied NADPH oxidase isoform is the phagocyte Nox2 (previously termed gp91phox), which depends on p22phox and whose activation requires assembly with the cytosolic regulatory subunits p47phox and p67phox (3Nauseef W.M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 122: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), along with GTP-loaded Rac1 or Rac2. Similar to Nox2, the homologue Nox1 requires regulatory subunits. Unlike all the other Nox proteins, Nox4 is constitutively active and is independent of cytosolic activator proteins or regulatory domains (4Ambasta R.K. Kumar P. Griendling K.K. Schmidt H.H. Busse R.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8010-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Another interesting difference between Nox1/2 and Nox4 is that Nox1 and Nox2 produce primarily O2̇̄, whereas most studies report that Nox4 generates H2O2 (4Ambasta R.K. Kumar P. Griendling K.K.

Given that the prosthetic groups are identical and the core protein structures are very similar among the Nox proteins, it has been suggested that the failure to detect O2̇̄ formation by Nox4 is a consequence of its intracellular location, resulting in problems detecting O2̇̄ within the cell and the inability of this ion to pass freely through the membrane. Indeed, although a significant fraction of Nox1 and Nox2 is located at the plasma membrane and thus would reduce extracellular oxygen, Nox4 is localized predominantly to intracellular membranes where any generated O2̇̄ might be cryptic. In fact, Nox4 protein has been reported in mitochondria (8Block K. Gorin Y. Abboud H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14385-14390Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), the nucleus (9Kuroda J. Nakagawa K. Yamasaki T. Nakamura K. Takeya R. Kuribayashi F. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Igarashi K. Shibata Y. Sueishi K. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 1139-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), the cytoskeleton (10Hilenski L.L. Clempus R.E. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), and the endoplasmic reticulum (11Chen K. Kirber M.T. Xiao H. Yang Y. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus, it was plausible to propose that O2̇̄ generated in these compartments must undergo dismutation to leave the cell as the freely diffusible H2O2. However, Nox4 in some cells resides in part in the plasma membrane but unexpectedly still produces H2O2 without any detectable O2̇̄ (12von Löhneysen K. Noack D. Wood M.R. Friedman J.S. Knaus U.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, a careful analysis of intracellular ROS formation using overexpressed Nox4 failed to detect Nox4-mediated O2̇̄ production using ESR spin traps and the dihydroethidium method (13Serrander L. Cartier L. Bedard K. Banfi B. Lardy B. Plastre O. Sienkiewicz A. Fórró L. Schlegel W. Krause K.H. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In contrast, Nox4 was able to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium. However, the site of the electron efflux from Nox4 to nitro blue tetrazolium has not yet been determined but is potentially via the FAD-containing dehydrogenase domain, which is known to catalyze the direct reduction of various dyes (14Nisimoto Y. Jackson H.M. Ogawa H. Kawahara T. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based on the above, it has to be concluded that although mechanistically, heme reduction of oxygen must initially generate O2̇̄, Nox4 releases H2O2 without releasing free O2̇̄. The molecular basis for this potentially physiologically important difference is unclear. Based on the presence of six transmembrane α-helical domains, the current model for NADPH oxidases predicts that the N- as well as C-terminal parts of the protein reside in the cytosol, giving rise to two intracellular loops (B- and D-loop) and three loops oriented away from the cytosol and toward the extracellular space or intracellular compartments (A-, C-, and E-loop). So far, little work has been devoted to the extracellular loops. Although asparagines within these regions are glycosylated in Nox2, to our knowledge, no mutations leading to chronic granulomatous disease have been reported for these loops. Also, the functional significance of glycosylation is somewhat uncertain as unlike human Nox2, the murine enzyme does not undergo this modification and glycosylation has not been reported for Nox1. Based upon their proximity to the site of oxygen reduction by the B heme, we hypothesized that differences in the extracellular loops are responsible for the unique ability of Nox4 to release H2O2 rather than O2̇̄. Nox sequences were aligned using the online program ClustalW2 from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) (15Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22512) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding human full-length Nox1, Nox4, and p22phox were kindly provided by T. Leto (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The plasmids coding for mouse Noxa1 and Noxo1 were generous gifts of B. Banfi (Iowa University, Iowa City, IA). The plasmids coding for the Nox4 deletion mutants were generated by overlap extension PCR. The plasmids coding for the cysteine and histidine mutants of Nox1 and Nox4 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cloned plasmids were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Transient transfection of HEK293 or Cos7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells stably expressing Nox4 Δ218–235 + Δ264–273 were generated by transfection with linearized plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000 and subsequent antibiotic selection. HEK293 or Cos7 cells were seeded on 3.5-cm dishes and transiently transfected. After 24 h, EDTA-detached cells were suspended in 500 μl of HEPES-modified Tyrode's solution containing the appropriate chemiluminescence enhancer. As enhancer for H2O2, luminol (Sigma; 100 μm) in combination with horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Sigma; 1 units/ml) were used. As enhancer for O2̇̄, L-012 (WAKO Chemicals, Richmond, VA, 200 μm) was used. As enhancer for peroxynitrite (ONOO−), luminol without HRP was used, and DetaNONOate (Enzo Life Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA; 100 μm) was added as NO donor to facilitate the formation of ONOO− from O2̇̄. HEK293 cells were grown on 12-well plates and transiently transfected. 24 h later, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently incubated in PBS containing 100 μm Amplex Red and 0.25 units/ml HRP. After 30 min, the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate, and H2O2-dependent oxidation of Amplex Red was measured in a microplate fluorometer (excitation 540 nm, emission 580 nm). H2O2 formation was quantified by a standard curve of known H2O2 concentrations. HEK293 cells were seeded on 12-well plates and transiently transfected. 24 h later, cells were washed once in HEPES-modified Tyrode's solution containing cytochrome c (from horse heart; Sigma; 1 mg/ml) and then incubated in this solution in the presence or absence of superoxide dismutase (Sigma, 100 units/ml) at 37 °C. After 30–60 min, supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes on ice, and the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c was quantified in a spectrophotometer (Uvikon, Kontron Instruments). Data were normalized to the isosbestic points at 542 and 558 nm, and O2̇̄ formation was calculated with the aid of the molar extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated for 8 h with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μm, Calbiochem) to stabilize and increase the Nox expression. Cell lysis, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot were carried out (16Helmcke I. Heumüller S. Tikkanen R. Schröder K. Brandes R.P. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-Nox1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology: Mox-1 H-15); anti-Nox4 (generated by us (17Anilkumar N. Weber R. Zhang M. Brewer A. Shah A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)); anti-β-actin (Sigma); and anti-Erk1/2 and anti-phosphorylated Erk1/2 (Cell Signaling). HEK293 cells stably expressing Nox4 Δ218–235 + Δ264–273 were seeded on μ-dishes (ibidi, Martinsried, Germany). When the cells reached ∼80% confluence, they were incubated for 8 h with the translation inhibitor anisomycin (Calbiochem; 20 μm) to reduce potential localization of the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum due to de novo synthesis. Imaging was carried out as described (16Helmcke I. Heumüller S. Tikkanen R. Schröder K. Brandes R.P. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with the following antibodies: anti-Nox4 (generated by us) and anti-GRP78 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for endoplasmic reticulum staining. Unless otherwise stated, all data shown are mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test or by paired or unpaired t test, if appropriate. To identify a structural basis for the H2O2 formation of Nox4, we compared this protein with Nox1 and Nox2. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of human and mouse Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 revealed that the E-loop of Nox4 is 28 amino acids longer than the E-loop of Nox1 and Nox2 (Fig. 1A) as a consequence of two insertions of 18 and 10 amino acids, respectively. The sequence within the two insertions is similar among Nox4s from different species, suggesting a conserved Nox4-specific function. We deleted these Nox4-specific E-loop regions so as to approximate the length of the E-loop in Nox1 and Nox2 (Fig. 1B). These mutations, which did not affect the endoplasmic reticulum localization of Nox4 (Fig. 1C), had a strong effect on ROS production by Nox4; the mutants produced very little H2O2 when compared with native Nox4 and instead released O2̇̄ (Fig. 1, D and E). The effect was more pronounced in the double deletion mutant, which lacked both sequence insertions, but deletion of amino acids 264–273 was almost equally effective. Although the Nox4 deletion mutants produced O2̇̄, their O2̇̄ formation rate was still lower than that of native Nox1 when equimolar amounts of the expression plasmid were transfected (data not shown). Given that Nox4 del218–235+264–273 colocalized with the heat-shock protein GRP78 (Fig. 1C) and thus is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum-like native Nox4, we conclude that the type of ROS formed by Nox proteins is an intrinsic feature of the protein and not a consequence of the intracellular localization. The E-loops of Nox4 as well as Nox1 and Nox2 both contain two conserved cysteines, although they are located in different positions in the two isoforms. In Nox4, both are lost upon the construction of the deletion mutants of Nox4. As the cysteines might form a disulfide bridge to maintain the integrity of the E-loop, we studied their role for the function of Nox4. Mutation of the cysteines to valines had a similar, although less pronounced, effect on ROS production by Nox4 as the deletion constructs (Fig. 2, A and B), as demonstrated by chemiluminescence as well as cytochrome c reduction and Amplex Red oxidation. A plasmid harboring the mutation of both Nox4 cysteines together showed a more pronounced effect on the switching of the ROS type generated than the single mutations (data not shown). Mutation of the two cysteines in Nox1 decreased the overall activity of the enzyme but did not change the type of ROS released (Fig. 2C). These data show that even minor alterations of the E-loop of Nox4 switch the protein from H2O2 to O2̇̄ production and that the integrity of the E-loop is also essential for O2̇̄ formation of Nox1. To address whether the H2O2 formation of Nox4 occurs via free intermediate formation of O2̇̄ and to further exclude that H2O2 formation is a consequence of some artifact of the detection system, we studied ROS formation in the presence of an NO donor using luminol chemiluminescence. We hypothesized that the failure to detect O2̇̄ by various methods may have resulted from a combination of poor access to the site of formation of O2̇̄ and/or relatively slow rates of reaction of the probe with O2̇̄. NO, on the other hand, is known to react at a near diffusion controlled rate with O2̇̄ to yield ONOO−, and its small size should allow better access to the site of ROS generation when compared with larger probes. Therefore, if any free O2̇̄ is formed by Nox4, it should react rapidly with NO to yield ONOO−, which is able to oxidize luminol in the absence of HRP. Indeed, for overexpressed Nox1, the DetaNONOate-induced luminol signal was easily detected, whereas overexpressed Nox4 failed to produce any luminol signal. These data exclude that significant amounts of O2̇̄ are released by Nox4. Importantly, similar to the other assays that detected O2̇̄ (above), the E-loop mutants of Nox4 produced ONOO− (Fig. 3). A general problem with mutational analyses is that local changes in structure may affect the function of an enzyme at a remote site by some allosteric modulations. We therefore sought a second approach to interfere with the E-loop. Recently, a monoclonal antibody directed against this part of the protein was generated (mAb8E9) (18Zhang L. Nguyen M.V. Lardy B. Jesaitis A.J. Grichine A. Rousset F. Talbot M. Paclet M.H. Qian G. Morel F. Biochimie. 2011; 93: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When compared with an antibody that binds in the NADPH binding site (Fig. 3C), Western blot analysis confirmed that the antibody mAb8E9 binds the E-loop as labeling was lost in the Nox4 mutants (Fig. 4). As the antibody can only directly interact with extracellular portions of Nox4, this part of the study was carried out in Cos7 cells, which exhibit some plasma membrane expression of this NADPH oxidase (12von Löhneysen K. Noack D. Wood M.R. Friedman J.S. Knaus U.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The addition of the mAb8E9 decreased H2O2 production by Nox4-transfected Cos7 cells by ∼20% (Fig. 4), and in a pilot study, mAb8E9 also increased the O2̇̄ formation of Nox4 (+28 ± 11%, n = 2). Importantly, a nonspecific mouse IgG control at the same concentration had no effect on ROS formation by Nox4, and also, mAb8E9 did not alter O2̇̄ production in Nox1-overexpressing cells. The interpretation of the signaling is, however, difficult as the fraction of plasma membrane-localized Nox4 to total Nox4 is unknown. To estimate the amount of Nox4 accessible by this approach, we treated the cells with the non-cell-permeable cross-linker bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (1 mm), assuming that this should destroy the Nox4 activity at the plasma membrane, and indeed, Nox4 protein became undetectable by Western blot after cross-linking (data not shown). With respect to ROS production, bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate was equally effective as mAb8E9 in reducing H2O2 formation by Nox4. Surprisingly, the compound increased O2̇̄ produced by Nox1, suggesting that indeed alterations of the extracytosolic loop directly affect the efficacy of O2̇̄ formation (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis of the Nox4 deletion constructs (Fig. 3C) indicated that the protein Nox4 del218–235 might be unstable as it was detected with a molecular mass of 6 kDa less than the calculated mass. As, however, ROS measurements of the other deletion constructs and the cysteine mutants in the same region yielded similar results, the reduced stability of this single construct might be of lesser importance for the interpretation of the data. Our data so far suggest that Nox4 directly generates H2O2 without the formation of significant amounts of a free O2̇̄ intermediate. To generate H2O2, Nox4 either has to act as a dioxygenase (which could not occur from the heme itself) or has to facilitate the transfer of an electron from one O2̇̄ to a second, in effect acting as a superoxide dismutase. We speculate that histidine residues might play a role in generating H2O2 by serving as a source for protons or by binding a metal, as is needed for catalysis by all known superoxide dismutase enzymes. Structure alignment revealed that in addition to those that are directly involved in heme ligation, Nox4 contains five additional highly conserved histidines in its membrane integrated part (Fig. 5A), and interestingly, three of these are located in the E-loop. We mutated these five histidines to glutamine and studied protein expression and ROS formation by the mutants. The mutations of His-47, His-246, and His-248 had no effect on ROS production, whereas H16Q reduced H2O2 formation by Nox4 by ∼50% without affecting O2̇̄ formation. In contrast, Nox4-H222Q, which carries the mutation at the beginning of the E-loop, produced almost no H2O2 and instead released O2̇̄ (Fig. 5B). The expression of the histidine mutants was similar to that of native Nox4 as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C). These observations not only confirm that the E-loop is central for H2O2 formation but also indicate that specific features of the E-loop are required for the process. In the final step, we sought to demonstrate that the type of ROS released by Nox4 is physiologically relevant. Unlike Nox2 and Nox1, Nox4 activity has previously been linked to Erk1/2 phosphorylation (17Anilkumar N. Weber R. Zhang M. Brewer A. Shah A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the activation of this MAP kinase in response to the overexpression of Nox4 versus Nox4 cysteine mutants. Although overexpression of native Nox4 induced a robust Erk1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells, this effect was not observed with the cysteine mutants, although they were expressed to a similar level and total Erk1/2 expression was not affected by this approach (Fig. 6). These data indicate that the direct formation of H2O2 by Nox4 has important biological consequences for Nox-dependent signal transduction. In this work, we studied the structural basis for H2O2 formation by Nox4. We identified the extended E-loop of the protein as an essential structural feature for this process and showed that alterations of the E-loop switch Nox4 from an H2O2 into an O2̇̄-producing enzyme. The ROS product generated appears to be sensitive to minor structural perturbations in the E-loop because binding by a monoclonal antibody or cross-linking at the cell surface impaired H2O2 formation by Nox4 but not O2̇̄ formation by Nox1. H2O2 formation appeared to be an intrinsic function of Nox4 as we could not detect O2̇̄ formation, based on the formation of ONOO− in the presence of an NO donor. In agreement with such a scenario, we identified a highly conserved histidine in the E-loop, which might serve as source of protons or as a binding site for metals to provide superoxide dismutase activity to Nox4. Based on their similarity to Nox2 and the obligate 1-electron transfer from heme iron, all Nox NADPH oxidases should primarily produce O2̇̄ (1Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4908) Google Scholar). The H2O2 formation by Nox4 was therefore initially interpreted as artifact but occurring as a result of the use of reagents that detected exclusively extracellular ROS generated by an intracellular enzyme. Mutational analysis (16Helmcke I. Heumüller S. Tikkanen R. Schröder K. Brandes R.P. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), intracellular probes for ROS detection (13Serrander L. Cartier L. Bedard K. Banfi B. Lardy B. Plastre O. Sienkiewicz A. Fórró L. Schlegel W. Krause K.H. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and comparative expression studies in cells exhibiting different localizations of Nox4 (12von Löhneysen K. Noack D. Wood M.R. Friedman J.S. Knaus U.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), however, demonstrated that the type of ROS produced by the enzyme is independent of its localization. This suggests that Nox NADPH oxidases can directly release either O2̇̄ or H2O2 and that this feature is dependent on structural properties of the individual Nox enzyme. Nox4, indeed, is not the only Nox homologue that primarily produces H2O2. Under physiological conditions, the Duox enzymes also generate H2O2 exclusively (19Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 20Forteza R. Salathe M. Miot F. Forteza R. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms leading to Duox-dependent H2O2 formation are not clear but appear to be distinct from that of Nox4. Based on homologue searches, it was suggested that Duox enzymes might bear an intrinsic superoxide dismutase activity localized to the peroxidase homology domain of these proteins (21Leto T.L. Geiszt M. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 1549-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but recently, it was shown that although structurally similar to peroxidases, mammalian Duox enzymes are not able to directly dismutate O2̇̄ (22Meitzler J.L.

Rather, the type of ROS generated appears to depend on the maturation state of the Duox enzymes. In the absence of the maturation factors Duoxa1 or Duoxa2, the Duox enzymes generate O2̇̄, and only after interaction with the Duoxa proteins does H2O2 formation becomes apparent (23Ameziane-El-Hassani R. Morand S. Boucher J.L. Frapart Y.M. Apostolou D. Agnandji D. Gnidehou S. Ohayon R. Noël-Hudson M.S. Francon J. Lalaoui K. Virion A. Dupuy C. J. Biol.

This process also involves relocalization of the Duox-Duoxa complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, and it is not clear whether localization impacts the observed reduced oxygen species (24Morand S.

The enzymatic activity of the Duox enzymes is independent of p22phox, whereas the maturation of Nox2 (25DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B. Yu L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol.

Thus, it is not an understatement that, by analogy with the Duox-Duoxa proteins, p22phox was referred to as a maturation factor for the Nox proteins (24Morand S. Ueyama T. Tsujibe S. Saito N. Korzeniowska A. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Divergent from this concept, it was observed that alteration of the maturation factors for the Duox proteins switch them from H2O2 to O2̇̄ formation (24Morand S. Ueyama T. Tsujibe S. Saito N. Korzeniowska A. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas so far no mutation in p22phox was reported to induce such a transition for Nox4 (7von Löhneysen K. Noack D.

Interestingly, based on truncation experiments, it can be concluded that at least some different regions of p22phox interact with Nox1/2 when compared with Nox4 (7von Löhneysen K. Noack D.

https://openalex.org/W2065293842,"Many stem, progenitor and cancer cells undergo periods of mitotic quiescence from which they can be reactivated. The signals triggering entry into and exit from this reversible dormant state are not well understood. In the developing Drosophila central nervous system, multipotent self-renewing progenitors called neuroblasts undergo quiescence in a stereotypical spatiotemporal pattern. Entry into quiescence is regulated by Hox proteins and an internal neuroblast timer. Exit from quiescence (reactivation) is subject to a nutritional checkpoint requiring dietary amino acids. Organ co-cultures also implicate an unidentified signal from an adipose/hepatic-like tissue called the fat body. Here we provide in vivo evidence that Slimfast amino-acid sensing and Target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling activate a fat-body-derived signal (FDS) required for neuroblast reactivation. Downstream of this signal, Insulin-like receptor signalling and the Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/TOR network are required in neuroblasts for exit from quiescence. We demonstrate that nutritionally regulated glial cells provide the source of Insulin-like peptides (ILPs) relevant for timely neuroblast reactivation but not for overall larval growth. Conversely, ILPs secreted into the haemolymph by median neurosecretory cells systemically control organismal size but do not reactivate neuroblasts. Drosophila thus contains two segregated ILP pools, one regulating proliferation within the central nervous system and the other controlling tissue growth systemically. Our findings support a model in which amino acids trigger the cell cycle re-entry of neural progenitors via a fat-body-glia-neuroblasts relay. This mechanism indicates that dietary nutrients and remote organs, as well as local niches, are key regulators of transitions in stem-cell behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W2005357928,"The harmonic oscillator is one of the simplest physical systems but also one of the most fundamental. It is ubiquitous in nature, often serving as an approximation for a more complicated system or as a building block in larger models. Realizations of harmonic oscillators in the quantum regime include electromagnetic fields in a cavity [1-3] and the mechanical modes of a trapped atom [4] or macroscopic solid [5]. Quantized interaction between two motional modes of an individual trapped ion has been achieved by coupling through optical fields [6], and entangled motion of two ions in separate locations has been accomplished indirectly through their internal states [7]. However, direct controllable coupling between quantized mechanical oscillators held in separate locations has not been realized previously. Here we implement such coupling through the mutual Coulomb interaction of two ions held in trapping potentials separated by 40 um (similar work is reported in a related paper [8]). By tuning the confining wells into resonance, energy is exchanged between the ions at the quantum level, establishing that direct coherent motional coupling is possible for separately trapped ions. The system demonstrates a building block for quantum information processing and quantum simulation. More broadly, this work is a natural precursor to experiments in hybrid quantum systems, such as coupling a trapped ion to a quantized macroscopic mechanical or electrical oscillator [9-13]."

IntroductionAcross the tropics, 10 million people are infected by the parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agents of Chagas disease and human African trypanosomiasis, respectively (1Brun R.

They are responsible for 60,000 deaths per year and represent a major public health problem in regions of the world least able to deal with the associated economic burden. Their primary route of transmission is by blood-sucking insect vectors. However, other pathways, notably blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and illicit drug usage coupled with population migration, have resulted in both infections becoming problematic in non-endemic areas (3Bern C. Montgomery S.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2009; 49: e52-e54Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 4Gascon J. Bern C. Pinazo M.J.

Parola P. Euro Surveill. 2009; 14 (pii=19327)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chagas disease is an emerging problem with as many as 300,000 people in the United States infected by T. cruzi, and blood supplies are now routinely screened for the parasite. Current treatment of both infections is restricted to a series of drugs whose mode(s) of action are poorly understood (6Wilkinson S.R. Kelly J.M. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2009; 11: e31Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Establishing how existing therapies work could contribute to more effective treatment and aid drug development.The 5-nitrofuran drug nifurtimox has been used for more than 40 years to treat Chagas disease. Its use is controversial as it is toxic, reportedly carcinogenic, and of limited efficacy. Additionally, T. cruzi strains refractory to treatment have been isolated, a situation compounded by failure to complete the recommended drug schedules. Nifurtimox drug regimes can take up to 4 months and are frequently associated with unpleasant side effects. Despite these problems, nifurtimox, as part of the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy, is now recommended for late-stage West African sleeping sickness (7Priotto G. Fogg C. Balasegaram M.

Oncol. 2009; 31: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).As with most nitroheterocyclic agents, nifurtimox functions as a prodrug and must undergo activation by nitroreduction. Two classes of enzyme can catalyze this process, the type I and type II nitroreductases (11Peterson F.J. Mason R.P. Hovsepian J. Holtzman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4009-4014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type I nitroreductases are NAD(P)H-dependent, FMN binding proteins commonly found in bacteria but rare in eukaryotes. They mediate a two-electron reduction of the nitro group to generate a nitroso intermediate (Reaction 1) that rapidly undergoes reduction to a hydroxylamine derivative (Reaction 2):RNO2+2e−→RNORNO+2e−→RNHOHREACTION 1 AND 2For nitrofuran compounds, the hydroxylamine can then be processed further to generate either the amine, which is believed to be inert, or nitrenium cations that promote DNA breakage (12McCalla D.R. Reuvers A. Kaiser C. Cancer Res. 1971; 31: 2184-2188PubMed Google Scholar, 13Streeter A.J. Hoener B.A. Pharm. Res. 1988; 5: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Beckett A.H. Robinson A.E. J. Med. Pharm. Chem. 1959; 1: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Alternatively, fragmentation of the furan ring may occur, yielding open-chain nitriles (11Peterson F.J. Mason R.P. Hovsepian J. Holtzman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4009-4014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gavin J.J. Ebetino F.F. Freedman R. Waterbury W.E. Arch. Biochem.

Because reduction by type I nitroreductase does not involve oxygen and does not result in the production of reactive oxygen species, this activity is said to be “oxygen-insensitive.”In contrast, the ubiquitous type II nitroreductases contain FMN or FAD as a co-factor, and their activity is “oxygen-sensitive.” They catalyze the one-electron reduction of a substrate, forming a nitro anion radical (Reaction 3) (17Mason R.P. Holtzman J.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1626-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the presence of oxygen, this radical undergoes futile cycling, resulting in the production of superoxide anions and regeneration of the parent nitro-compound (Reaction 4) (18Mason R.P.

Commun. 1975; 67: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).RNO2+e−→RNO2.−RNO2.−+O2→RNO2+O2.−REACTION 3 AND 4Following observations that nifurtimox-treated trypanosomal extracts generated superoxide anions and nitro anion radicals, it was proposed that this compound mediated its activity through induction of oxidative stress in reactions catalyzed by type II nitroreductases (19Docampo R.

Several flavoproteins, including dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 reductase, and trypanothione reductase, were subsequently shown to mediate the one-electron reduction of nifurtimox in vitro (21Viodé C.

To date there is insufficient functional evidence to suggest that this occurs in vivo and that trypanosomes overexpressing trypanothione reductase display the same susceptibility to nifurtimox as control cells (24Kelly J.M. Taylor M.C. Smith K. Hunter K.J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The only experimental evidence for superoxide anion involvement in nifurtimox toxicity is indirect and comes from studies on the trypanosomal superoxide dismutase repertoire. T. brucei TbSODB1 null mutants displayed enhanced sensitivity to nifurtimox (25Prathalingham S.R. Wilkinson S.R. Horn D. Kelly J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The same pattern of redox cycling seen in T. cruzi is observed in mammalian cells, and the selectivity of this prodrug toward the parasite is not explained by this model. Despite these issues, oxidative stress resulting from type II nitroreductase activity has been generally accepted as the main trypanocidal mechanism of nifurtimox, although this has been questioned (26Boiani M. Piacenza L. Hernández P. Boiani L. Cerecetto H. González M. Denicola A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010; 79: 1736-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Wilkinson S.R. Taylor M.C. Horn D.

Parasitol. 2011; 176: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Recently, an alternative activation mechanism has been proposed following the identification of two trypanosomal enzymes that can catalyze the two-electron reduction of nifurtimox (27Wilkinson S.R.

One, a prostaglandin F2α synthase, also known as the Old Yellow Enzyme, expressed by T. cruzi, can reduce the nitrofuran in vitro, but oxidoreductase activity only occurs under anaerobic conditions. The contribution, if any, that this enzyme makes to drug metabolism within the parasite has not been established. The second pathway involves a trypanosomal type I nitroreductase (NTR) 2The abbreviations used are: NTR, trypanosomal type I nitroreductase; ESI, electrospray ionization; TbCPR2 and TbCPR3, Trypanosoma brucei cytochrome P450 reductase 2 and 3, respectively; TbNTR, Trypanosoma brucei type I nitroreductase; TbPGS, Trypanosoma brucei prostaglandin F2α synthase; TcNTR, Trypanosoma cruzi type I nitroreductase. that displays characteristics shown by many of its bacterial homologues; the activity is oxygen-insensitive, the enzyme contains FMN as co-factor, and it can metabolize a wide range of nitro- and quinone-based compounds. Using T. cruzi and T. brucei lines with altered levels of this enzyme, a clear link between this nitroreductase activity and nifurtimox activation has been demonstrated (27Wilkinson S.R. Taylor M.C. Horn D. Kelly J.M. Cheeseman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5022-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Null mutant/heterozygous cells display resistance to various nitroheterocyclic agents, including nifurtimox, whereas overexpression confers hypersensitivity. Additionally, T. cruzi selected for resistance to nifurtimox were found to have lost one copy of the chromosome containing the TcNTR gene.The aim of this work was to determine the role of NTRs in nifurtimox action. We show that although low levels of oxygen consumption can be detected during nifurtimox reduction, NTRs are predominantly oxygen-insensitive enzymes that catalyze the four-electron reduction of the nitrofuran under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This produces an unsaturated open-chain nitrile that displays equivalent cytotoxicity toward mammalian and parasite cells, unlike the parental prodrug.DISCUSSIONThe mode of action and basis of selectivity of the anti-trypanosomal compound nifurtimox has been an enigma since its introduction as a therapy for Chagas disease. In this article we provide evidence showing that trypanosomal type I nitroreductases catalyze reduction of this prodrug to an unsaturated open-chain nitrile derivative (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) and that the product, unlike the nitrofuran precursor, displays equivalent growth inhibitory properties against parasite and mammalian cells (Fig. 6). Together, these findings demonstrate that selective toxicity of nifurtimox may be attributable to type I nitroreductase expression by trypanosomes and indicate that this prodrug mediates a significant component of its anti-parasitic activity by a mechanism other than induction of oxidative stress.Activation of nitrofurans can occur by two routes, involving the two-electron reduction of the compound, reactions mediated by type I nitroreductases, or a one-electron pathway, as catalyzed by type II enzymes. Bacteria express both activities, but it is the type I system that underpins the selectivity of nitrofuran antibiotics (39McCalla D.R. Kaiser C. Green M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 10-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sastry S.S. Jayaraman R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 379-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 41Whiteway J. Koziarz P. Veall J. Sandhu N. Kumar P. Hoecher B. Lambert I.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5529-5539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prokaryotes selected for resistance to nitrofurazone invariably acquire mutations in their type I nitroreductase genes. Following activation, the precise antimicrobial action of these prodrugs is largely unknown, but it is believed to rely on production of toxic intermediate metabolites that ultimately trigger DNA damage and cell death (12McCalla D.R. Reuvers A. Kaiser C. Cancer Res. 1971; 31: 2184-2188PubMed Google Scholar, 13Streeter A.J. Hoener B.A. Pharm. Res. 1988; 5: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, nitrofuran reduction in eukaryotic cells is generally mediated by enzymes with a type II activity, leading to nitro anion radical formation. In an aerobic environment, the radical then undergoes futile cycling, resulting in regeneration of the parental nitro-compound and production of reactive oxygen species (11Peterson F.J. Mason R.P. Hovsepian J. Holtzman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4009-4014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mason R.P. Holtzman J.L.

The latter may then induce a state of oxidative stress in the target cell. Mammalian cells do express enzymes that can mediate the two-electron reduction of nitroaromatic compounds (42Boland M.P. Knox R.J. Roberts J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 43Wu K. Knox R. Sun X.Z. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Zhang D. Deng P.S. Chen S. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5593-5603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but these activities are generally low in normal tissues and elevated in tumor cells, a difference that has been exploited in the development of anti-cancer therapies (45Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Whether such eukaryotic enzymes play a role in nitrofuran metabolism has not been addressed.The predominance of type II nitroreductases in eukaryotic cells, coupled with observations that nifurtimox-treated trypanosome extracts generated superoxide anions and nitro anion radicals, supported the proposal that parasite killing activity was mediated by the induction of oxidative stress. As a consequence, the presence of trypanosomal type I enzymes and their role in nitrofuran activation has been largely overlooked. However, following the identification of NTR and demonstration of its key role in nitroaromatic drug toxicity, the mechanism of nifurtimox action needs to be re-evaluated (27Wilkinson S.R. Taylor M.C. Horn D. Kelly J.M. Cheeseman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5022-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Against this backdrop, we overexpressed prostaglandin F2α synthase and two cytochrome P450 reductases, enzymes reported to interact with nifurtimox (29Kubata B.K. Kabututu Z. Nozaki T. Munday C.J. Fukuzumi S. Ohkubo K. Lazarus M. Maruyama T. Martin S.K. Duszenko M. Urade Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Portal P. Villamil S.F. Alonso G.D.

Parasitol. 2008; 160: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that elevation of their levels in bloodstream-form T. brucei had no effect on toxicity (Fig. 1). In contrast, the central role of NTR in this process was clearly demonstrated, as parasites with elevated levels were hypersensitive to nifurtimox (Fig. 1) in agreement with our previous work (27Wilkinson S.R. Taylor M.C. Horn D. Kelly J.M. Cheeseman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5022-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 32Hall B.S. Wu X. Hu L. Wilkinson S.R. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, in a whole-genome “loss of function” screen using nifurtimox against an induced T. brucei RNAi library, the only hits generated targeted the TbNTR transcript (28Baker N. Alsford S. Horn D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2011; 176: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, NTR remains the only trypanosomal enzyme with a confirmed role in nifurtimox activation within the parasite.The ability of NTR to reduce nitroheterocyclic compounds, including nifurtimox, under aerobic conditions indicates that this enzyme is a type I nitroreductase. Our observation that nifurtimox metabolism was slightly more efficient under anaerobic than aerobic conditions and the low level of oxygen consumption (Fig. 2) are fully consistent with the activity reported for Escherichia coli oxygen-insensitive enzymes, previously ascribed to protein impurities (11Peterson F.J. Mason R.P. Hovsepian J. Holtzman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4009-4014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of oxygen on activity may reflect that certain intermediaries generated by type I catalysis are prone to oxidation (46Nivinskas H. Koder R.L. Anusevicius Z. Sarlauskas J. Miller A.F. Cenas N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Some hydroxylamines can be oxidized when exposed to air. Alternatively, the type I/type II dichotomy may be less absolute than previously thought. In any case, it is clear that the predominant mode of NTR action is via a two-electron reduction pathway.Several different reaction products have been identified from the type I-mediated reduction of nitrofurans, including amines and open-chain nitriles (11Peterson F.J. Mason R.P. Hovsepian J. Holtzman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4009-4014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gavin J.J. Ebetino F.F. Freedman R. Waterbury W.E. Arch. Biochem.

However, in many cases these are reported to be biologically inactive. Instead, prodrug toxicity is believed to occur via formation of protein and nucleic acid adducts with reactive intermediates such as the hydroxylamine or nitrenium ions (12McCalla D.R. Reuvers A. Kaiser C. Cancer Res. 1971; 31: 2184-2188PubMed Google Scholar, 13Streeter A.J. Hoener B.A. Pharm. Res. 1988; 5: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 47Swaminathan S. Lower Jr., G.M. Bryan G.T. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4479-4484PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that the nitrile product generated from nifurtimox is toxic to bloodstream-form trypanosomes, displaying an IC50 value comparable with that of the parent compound (Fig. 6). Additionally, unlike nifurtimox itself, the metabolite also demonstrated significant growth inhibitory activity against a cultured mammalian cell line. For most nitrofurans, reduction to the open-chain nitrile is reported to go to completion, with the biologically inactive saturated form being the main end product. For nifurtimox reduction this is not the case, and the major open-chain nitrile formed is in the unsaturated state. One explanation for why other groups have not detected significant quantities of the unsaturated open-chain nitrile is that products were isolated after prolonged incubation (>48 h) or were derived from animals during pharmacological testing (15Gavin J.J. Ebetino F.F. Freedman R. Waterbury W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 113: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Swaminathan S. Bryan G.T. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 2331-2338PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in our system, LC/MS analysis of the nifurtimox-derived material was performed within 60 min of initiating the reaction. However, even after 24 h, the unsaturated open-chain nitrile product generated from nifurtimox was still the major peak in traces, with only small amounts of the saturated form detectable. This indicates that the unsaturated open-chain nitrile derived from this trypanocidal prodrug is relatively stable, and this stability may explain why nifurtimox is an effective anti-parasitic agent despite being a poor substrate for NTRs compared with other nitroheterocyclic compounds (32Hall B.S. Wu X. Hu L. Wilkinson S.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Bot C. Hall B.S. Bashir N. Taylor M.C. Helsby N.A. Wilkinson S.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As unsaturated open-chain nitriles have rarely been observed following nitroreduction, their role in nitrofuran toxicity has been overlooked, and the mechanism of action is unknown. The unsaturated open-chain nitrile derived from nifurtimox has the potential to function as a Michael acceptor and could react non-specifically with a range of cellular components. This may explain the pleiotropic effects of nifurtimox on trypanosomes, where treatment has been reported to inhibit various enzyme activities, modify thiol levels, and cause DNA damage (21Viodé C.

Biochem. 1989; 180: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).We have now shown that nifurtimox reduction by a trypanosomal type I nitroreductase leads to formation of a toxic product. The precise mode of action of the resultant unsaturated open-chain nitrile product remains to be determined, but given that it is equally toxic to mammalian and parasite cells, it is plausible that the downstream targets are common to both host and pathogen. If this is the case, then the basis of nifurtimox selectivity is due to expression of the type I nitroreductase in the parasite. Understanding how nifurtimox exerts its trypanocidal effects may lead to the development of novel anti-parasitic drugs that utilize the bioreductive activity of this enzyme. IntroductionAcross the tropics, 10 million people are infected by the parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agents of Chagas disease and human African trypanosomiasis, respectively (1Brun R.

They are responsible for 60,000 deaths per year and represent a major public health problem in regions of the world least able to deal with the associated economic burden. Their primary route of transmission is by blood-sucking insect vectors. However, other pathways, notably blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and illicit drug usage coupled with population migration, have resulted in both infections becoming problematic in non-endemic areas (3Bern C. Montgomery S.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2009; 49: e52-e54Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 4Gascon J. Bern C. Pinazo M.J.

Chagas disease is an emerging problem with as many as 300,000 people in the United States infected by T. cruzi, and blood supplies are now routinely screened for the parasite. Current treatment of both infections is restricted to a series of drugs whose mode(s) of action are poorly understood (6Wilkinson S.R. Kelly J.M. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2009; 11: e31Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Establishing how existing therapies work could contribute to more effective treatment and aid drug development.The 5-nitrofuran drug nifurtimox has been used for more than 40 years to treat Chagas disease. Its use is controversial as it is toxic, reportedly carcinogenic, and of limited efficacy. Additionally, T. cruzi strains refractory to treatment have been isolated, a situation compounded by failure to complete the recommended drug schedules. Nifurtimox drug regimes can take up to 4 months and are frequently associated with unpleasant side effects. Despite these problems, nifurtimox, as part of the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy, is now recommended for late-stage West African sleeping sickness (7Priotto G. Fogg C. Balasegaram M.

Although much is understood about the molecular machinery that confers HIF responsiveness to oxygen, far less is known about HIF isoform-specific mechanisms of regulation, despite the fact that HIF-1 and HIF-2 exhibit distinct biological roles. We recently determined that the stress-responsive genetic regulator sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) selectively augments HIF-2 signaling during hypoxia. However, the mechanism by which Sirt1 maintains activity during hypoxia is unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that Sirt1 gene expression increases in a HIF-dependent manner during hypoxia in Hep3B and in HT1080 cells. Impairment of HIF signaling affects Sirt1 deacetylase activity as decreased HIF-1 signaling results in the appearance of acetylated HIF-2α, which is detected without pharmacological inhibition of Sirt1. We also find that Sirt1 augments HIF-2 mediated, but not HIF-1 mediated, transcriptional activation of the isolated Sirt1 promoter. These data in summary reveal a bidirectional link of HIF and Sirt1 signaling during hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2056713498,"MicroRNAs play important roles in tumor metastasis. Recently, we reported that the level of miR-520b is inversely related to the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-520b in breast cancer cell migration. We found that miR-520b suppressed the migration of breast cancer cells with high metastatic potential, including MDA-MB-231 and LM-MCF-7 cells, although the inhibition of miR-520b enhanced the migration of low metastatic potential MCF-7 cells. We further discovered that miR-520b directly targets the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of either hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP) or interleukin-8 (IL-8), which has been reported to contribute to cell migration. Surprisingly, tissue array assays showed that 75% (38:49) and 94% (36:38) of breast cancer tissues and metastatic lymph tissues, respectively, were positive for HBXIP expression. Moreover, overexpression of HBXIP was able to promote the migration of MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, HBXIP was able to regulate IL-8 transcription by NF-κB, suggesting that the two target genes of miR-520b are functionally connected. In addition, we found that miR-520b could indirectly regulate IL-8 transcription by targeting HBXIP. Thus, we conclude that miR-520b is involved in regulating breast cancer cell migration by targeting HBXIP and IL-8 via a network in which HBXIP promotes migration by stimulating NF-κB-mediated IL-8 expression. These studies point to HBXIP as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer."

The cross-linked form of this mutant protein, designated 147CC514, exhibited a significant decrease in the rate of interflavin electron transfer and large (≥90%) decreases in rates of electron transfer to its redox partners, cytochrome c and cytochrome P450 2B4. Reduction of the disulfide bond restored the ability of the mutant to reduce its redox partners, demonstrating that a conformational change is essential for CYPOR function.

https://openalex.org/W2020774181,"The mechanisms by which thymosin β 4 (Tβ(4)) regulates the inflammatory response to injury are poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that ectopic Tβ(4) treatment inhibits injury-induced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. We have also shown that Tβ(4) suppresses TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. Herein, we present novel evidence that Tβ(4) directly targets the NF-κB RelA/p65 subunit. We find that enforced expression of Tβ(4) interferes with TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation, as well as downstream IL-8 gene transcription. These activities are independent of the G-actin-binding properties of Tβ(4). Tβ(4) blocks RelA/p65 nuclear translocation and targeting to the cognate κB site in the proximal region of the IL-8 gene promoter. Tβ(4) also inhibits the sensitizing effects of its intracellular binding partners, PINCH-1 and ILK, on NF-κB activity after TNF-α stimulation. The identification of a functional regulatory role by Tβ(4) and the focal adhesion proteins PINCH-1 and ILK on NF-κB activity in this study opens a new window for scientific exploration of how Tβ(4) modulates inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W1978379971,"Cell surface proteoglycans on T cells contribute to retroviral infection, binding of chemokines and other proteins, and are necessary for some T cell responses to the matricellular glycoprotein thrombospondin-1. The major cell surface proteoglycans expressed by primary T cells and Jurkat T cells have an apparent M(r) > 200,000 and are modified with chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate chains. Thrombospondin-1 bound in a heparin-inhibitable manner to this proteoglycan and to a soluble form released into the medium. Based on mass spectrometry, knockdown, and immunochemical analyses, the proteoglycan contains two major core proteins as follows: amyloid precursor-like protein-2 (APLP2, apparent M(r) 230,000) and CD47 (apparent M(r) > 250,000). CD47 is a known thrombospondin-1 receptor but was not previously reported to be a proteoglycan. This proteoglycan isoform of CD47 is widely expressed on vascular cells. Mutagenesis identified glycosaminoglycan modification of CD47 at Ser(64) and Ser(79). Inhibition of T cell receptor signaling by thrombospondin-1 was lost in CD47-deficient T cells that express the proteoglycan isoform of APLP2, indicating that binding to APLP2 is not sufficient. Inhibition of CD69 induction was restored in CD47-deficient cells by re-expressing CD47 or an S79A mutant but not by the S64A mutant. Therefore, inhibition of T cell receptor signaling by thrombospondin-1 is mediated by CD47 and requires its modification at Ser(64)."

Most ERAD substrates are ubiquitinated through a reaction-mediated E3 ubiquitin ligase and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which transfer activated ubiquitin from the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme to specific lysine residues in the substrate or in a previously attached ubiquitin of a polyubiquitin chain. The polyubiquitination of substrates is an essential modification that ensures their efficient targeting to proteasomes for degradation. The specificity of substrate ubiquitination appears to be primarily determined by ubiquitin ligases.

Both of these enzymes are anchored to the ER through a hydrophobic domain with multiple membrane-spanning segments, and they contain a cytosolic domain with a RING finger motif that directs ubiquitin ligase activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that Hrd1 and Doa10 exist in distinct multiprotein complexes (7Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A.

The Doa10 ubiquitin ligase complex consists of Doa10, the cytosolic ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7 and its membrane anchor Cue1, and Ubx2, a ubiquitin regulatory X (Ubx)-domain containing protein that mediates recruitment of soluble cdc48 to membranes. Hrd1 associates with a large multiprotein complex that includes its cofactor Hrd3, Ubc7, and Cue1, the polytopic ER membrane protein Der1 and its recruitment factor Usa1, Ubx2/cdc48, and the Hsp70 chaperone Kar2 bound to the lectin Yos9. The presence of cdc48, which belongs to the family of ATPases associated with various cellular processes (AAA-ATPases), in Doa10 and Hrd1 complexes reflects the general function of the enzyme in the extraction of ubiquitinated ERAD substrates from membranes and their delivery to proteasomes (9Vij N.

Differences in the composition of Doa10 and Hrd1 complexes are thought to arise from the necessity of these enzymes to recognize distinct types of substrates. For example, Doa10-mediated ubiquitination appears to be restricted toward substrates with misfolded cytosolic domains, whereas Hrd1 recognizes substrates with both lumenal and intramembrane lesions (7Carvalho P.

Although mammalian ERAD ubiquitin ligase complexes have not been defined at the molecular level, they are likely to exist considering the degree of conservation of Hrd1 and Doa10 complex components across species and common features shared by the yeast and mammalian ERAD pathways. The number of ubiquitin ligases that mediate ERAD in mammalian cells appears to far exceed that in yeast (5Kostova Z. Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cell Dev.

One of these enzymes, termed gp78, mediates the sterol-accelerated ERAD of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The ER-resident reductase catalyzes the reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a rate-limiting reaction in the synthesis of cholesterol (11DeBose-Boyd R.A.

This sterol-accelerated ERAD contributes to a complex regulatory system that governs feedback regulation of reductase and prevents over-accumulation of cholesterol and other sterols (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of sterol overload, reductase binds to one of two ER membrane proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2 (14Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol.

This binding bridges reductase to Insig-associated gp78 that, together with its cognate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7, mediates ubiquitination of reductase. This ubiquitination imparts the recognition of reductase by VCP/p97, the mammalian homolog of yeast cdc48, for extraction from membranes and delivery to proteasomes for degradation. The cDNA for gp78 predicts a 643-amino acid protein that contains an N-terminal domain with 5–7 membrane-spanning segments (5Kostova Z. Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The C terminus of gp78 projects into the cytosol and contains a RING finger motif as well as binding sites for VCP/p97 and Ubc7. The membrane domain of gp78, which mediates its association with Insigs, is organized in membranes with a similar topology to that of human Hrd1. Although their membrane domains share significant amino acid homology, gp78, but not human Hrd1, binds to Insigs and mediates reductase degradation (15Song B.L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Glycerol gradient centrifugation studies indicate that human Hrd1 exists in a large multiprotein complex (16Schulze A. Standera S. Buerger E. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Koning F. Kloetzel P.M. Seeger M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); however, a complex containing gp78 has not been identified. In the current study we identify the ER membrane protein SPFH2 as an associated protein of gp78. Our results indicate that binding of SPFH2 to gp78 is mediated by a ubiquitin-like (UBL)-domain containing ER membrane protein called TMUB1. The relevance of this gp78-associated complex was indicated by the finding that RNAi-mediated knockdown of both SPFH2 and TMUB1 blunts sterol-induced ubiquitination and degradation of endogenous reductase. These studies indicate gp78 exists in a multiprotein complex containing an array of components that mediate various aspects of the ERAD pathway. The molecular characterization of this complex will likely have important implications for the ERAD of reductase and perhaps other gp78 substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2117290428,"Macroautophagy is a catabolic process by which cytosolic components are sequestered by double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and sorted to the lysosomes/vacuoles to be degraded. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has adapted this mechanism for constitutive transport of the specific vacuolar hydrolases aminopeptidase I (Ape1) and α-mannosidase (Ams1); this process is called the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. The precursor form of Ape1 self-assembles into an aggregate-like structure in the cytosol that is then recognized by Atg19 in a propeptide-dependent manner. The interaction between Atg19 and autophagosome-forming machineries allows selective packaging of the Ape1-Atg19 complex by the autophagosome-like Cvt vesicle. Ams1 also forms oligomers and utilizes the Ape1 transport system by interacting with Atg19. Although the mechanism of selective transport of the Cvt cargoes has been well studied, it is unclear whether proteins other than Ape1 and Ams1 are transported via the Cvt pathway. We describe here that aspartyl aminopeptidase (Yhr113w/Ape4) is the third Cvt cargo, which is similar in primary structure and subunit organization to Ape1. Ape4 has no propeptide, and it does not self-assemble into aggregates. However, it binds to Atg19 in a site distinct from the Ape1- and Ams1-binding sites, allowing it to ""piggyback"" on the Ape1 transport system. In growing conditions, a small portion of Ape4 localizes in the vacuole, but its vacuolar transport is accelerated by nutrient starvation, and it stably resides in the vacuole lumen. We propose that the cytosolic Ape4 is redistributed to the vacuole when yeast cells need more active vacuolar degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1960124967,"Intracellular pH (pH(i)), a major modulator of cell function, is regulated by acid/base transport across membranes. Excess intracellular H(+) ions (e.g. produced by respiration) are extruded by transporters such as Na(+)/H(+) exchange, or neutralized by HCO(3)(-) taken up by carriers such as Na(+)-HCO(3)(-) cotransport. Using fluorescence pH(i) imaging, we show that cancer-derived cell lines (colorectal HCT116 and HT29, breast MDA-MB-468, pancreatic MiaPaca2, and cervical HeLa) extrude acid by H(+) efflux and HCO(3)(-) influx, largely sensitive to dimethylamiloride and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS), respectively. The magnitude of HCO(3)(-) influx was comparable among the cell lines and may represent a constitutive element of tumor pH(i) regulation. In contrast, H(+) efflux varied considerably (MDA-MB-468 > HCT116 > HT29 > MiaPaca2 > HeLa). When HCO(3)(-) flux was pharmacologically inhibited, acid extrusion in multicellular HT29 and HCT116 spheroids (∼10,000 cells) was highly non-uniform and produced low pH(i) at the core. With depth, acid extrusion became relatively more DIDS-sensitive because the low extracellular pH at the spheroid core inhibits H(+) flux more than HCO(3)(-) flux. HCO(3)(-) flux inhibition also decelerated HCT116 spheroid growth. In the absence of CO(2)/HCO(3)(-), acid extrusion by H(+) flux in HCT116 and MDA-MB-468 spheroids became highly non-uniform and inadequate at the core. This is because H(+) transporters require extracellular mobile pH buffers, such as CO(2)/HCO(3)(-), to overcome low H(+) ion mobility and chaperone H(+) ions away from cells. CO(2)/HCO(3)(-) exerts a dual effect: as substrate for membrane-bound HCO(3)(-) transporters and as a mobile buffer for facilitating extracellular diffusion of H(+) ions extruded from cells. These processes can be augmented by carbonic anhydrase activity. We conclude that CO(2)/HCO(3)(-) is important for maintaining uniformly alkaline pH(i) in small, non-vascularized tumor growths and may be important for cancer disease progression."

Development of such peptide immunogens, however, has thus far been hindered by the lack of general design strategies to control the conformation of a given peptide sequence. In addition, most naked peptides have low inherent immunogenicity. Although design of peptide templates for the generation of antibodies that selectively recognize protein epitopes with an α-helical conformation has been reported (2Villard V. Agak G.W. Frank G.

Protein aggregation resulting from aberrant folding is characterized by the formation of proteinaceous deposits called amyloid, which exhibit β-sheet structure (11Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Misfolding is now associated with over 20 human diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer disease (AD), 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, β-amyloid protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; DMPC, 1, 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DMPG, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)); DMTAP, 1, 2-dimyristoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane; MAS, magic angle spinning; MPLA, monophosphoryl lipid A; ThT, thioflavin T; SEC, size exclusion chromatography.

Vaccines that can elicit antibodies against only the pathological β-sheet multimers of these targets would thus be considered advantageous from an efficacy perspective but also particularly from a safety perspective, where the non-folded protein has physiological relevance. In AD, β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) have been associated with disease progression over several decades of research, and the β-sheet aggregates of Aβ are one of the major pathological hallmarks of AD (13Roychaudhuri R.

Although the molecular pathology of AD has not yet been elucidated, a large variety of soluble and insoluble β-sheet Aβ(1–40/42) oligomers with different degrees of polymerization have been identified in vitro or in AD brain as synaptotoxic and likely causal agents of cognitive impairment (14Chimon S.

The importance of immunogen aggregation state upon immune response specificity has been demonstrated by the generation of antibodies with binding specificities for fibrillar (22Hock C. Konietzko U.

Control of peptide aggregation state is, however, precarious due to the stability issues associated with oligomers held together by non-covalent bonds. As a result of this, peptide immunogens are frequently used as heterogeneous mixtures of different secondary and quaternary conformations. On the other hand, vaccines that make use of covalently stabilized peptide multimers have hitherto been designed using de novo strategies that are not readily adaptable to target different oligomeric species. We have previously reported that the tetrapalmitoylated β-amyloid 1–15 peptide (Palm1–15) embedded into liposomes along with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), to generate liposomal vaccine ACI-24, could elicit an immune response that restored the cognitive impairment of APP transgenic mice (27Muhs A. Hickman D.T. Pihlgren M. Chuard N. Giriens V. Meerschman C. van der Auwera I. van Leuven F. Sugawara M. Weingertner M.C. Bechinger B. Greferath R. Kolonko N. Nagel-Steger L. Riesner D. Brady R.O. Pfeifer A. Nicolau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9810-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This truncated Aβ peptide sequence was chosen because it retains the immunodominant B-cell epitope of Aβ(1–42) but lacks the T-cell epitope (27Muhs A. Hickman D.T. Pihlgren M. Chuard N. Giriens V. Meerschman C. van der Auwera I. van Leuven F. Sugawara M. Weingertner M.C. Bechinger B. Greferath R. Kolonko N. Nagel-Steger L. Riesner D. Brady R.O. Pfeifer A. Nicolau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurology. 2003; 61: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that liposomal Palm1–15 (ACI-24) adopted a predominant β-sheet conformation although the N-terminal region of Aβ(1–40/42) is thought to be unstructured in vitro (29Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Moreover, introduction of a PEG spacer between peptide and lipid anchor removed the peptide from the liposome surface and gave rise to a liposomal peptide with a random coil conformation. When tested in APP transgenic mice, only ACI-24 restored the cognitive deficit, suggesting a link between peptide immunogen conformation and in vivo efficacy (27Muhs A. Hickman D.T. Pihlgren M. Chuard N. Giriens V. Meerschman C. van der Auwera I. van Leuven F. Sugawara M. Weingertner M.C. Bechinger B. Greferath R. Kolonko N. Nagel-Steger L. Riesner D. Brady R.O. Pfeifer A. Nicolau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9810-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe experiments aimed at understanding better the β-sheet conformation and establishing a structure-conformation relationship for liposomal Palm1–15 (ACI-24). In addition, we investigated whether the formation of a defined conformation is dependent upon the amino acid sequence. To this end, various peptides were lipidated and integrated into liposomes. To evaluate the utility of such constructs to generate conformation-specific antibodies in vivo, mice and monkeys were immunized with ACI-24, and the resulting antibodies were analyzed for conformation-specific binding to distinct conformations of Aβ(1–42) peptide as well as native protein. CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco-815 spectropolarimeter (Japan) with a 0.1 cm path length quartz cuvette at 23 °C. Measurements were made with a 1.0 nm bandwidth and 0.5 nm resolution. A scan speed of 50 nm/min was employed with response time of 1 s. Solvent control spectra (four scans) were averaged and subtracted from the average of eight scans of each sample spectra. All spectra ([θ]obs, degrees) were smoothed after being converted to mean residue molar ellipticity ([θ], degrees cm2 dmol−1) with the equation, [θ] = [θ]obs × (MRW/10lc), where MRW is the mean residue molecular weight (molecular weight/number of residues), l is the optical path length (cm), and c is the concentration (g/cm3). For analysis, liposomal suspensions were diluted 6-fold in PBS to give final peptide concentrations between 10 and 40 μm. Spectra of the corresponding empty liposomes lacking peptide were subtracted. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 °C on a Tecan M200 spectrofluorimeter with an excitation of 440 nm. Liposomes were diluted 8-fold in PBS to give a final peptide concentration of 15 μm, and then ThT was added at different concentrations. Data were fitted using non-linear regression analysis (SigmaPlot version 10.0) assuming single-site binding saturation in order to calculate apparent Kd and maximal binding Bmax. For disaggregation experiments, see the supplemental “Results.” Experiments were conducted using a 3.2-mm triple-resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) MAS probe (Bruker Biospin) at a static magnetic field of 16.4 T, corresponding to 700-MHz proton resonance frequency. For analysis, the amino acids Ala-2, Ser-8, and Gly-9 of Palm1–15 were uniformly labeled with 13C and 15N. This peptide Palm1–15(ASG) was then incorporated into liposomes composed of phospholipids (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphor-rac-(1-glycerol)) (DMPG), or 1,2-dimyristoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DMTAP)), cholesterol, and MPLA, giving a final peptide concentration of 121 μm. Spectra were acquired and processed as described under supplemental “Methods.” ACI-24 was prepared using the lipids DMPC, DMPG, cholesterol, and MPLA (all from Avanti Polar Lipids) at a molar ratio of 9:1:7:0.06 respectively. Palm1–15 was added to give a peptide/phospholipid ratio of 1:100 and at a final concentration of 121 μm (see supplemental “Methods” for details). Vaccine was characterized by cryo-EM and HPLC for peptide, MPLA, and lipid content (data not shown). All treatments were carried out in accordance to local regulations. C57BL/6 adult mice (10 females/group) received subcutaneous injections of ACI-24 on three occasions with a 2-week interval between each immunization (at days 0, 14, and 28). Blood samples were collected, and plasma prepared at day 35. Cynomolgus monkeys were immunized four times at 3-week intervals. 8.5 months after the last immunization, monkeys were reimmunized subcutaneously in the leg area with two doses of ACI-24 at days 2 and 24. Aβ(1–42) used for SEC-HPLC fractionation was synthesized and purified by Dr. James I. Elliott (Yale University (New Haven, CT). Aβ(1–42) powder (1 mg) was equilibrated to room temperature for 6 min and dissolved in 50 μl of DMSO, followed by 800 μl of doubly distilled H2O and 10 μl of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and mixed by vortex. The Aβ preparation was incubated for 3–4 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 10 min at 6,000 × g at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was immediately injected onto the HPLC and run over two columns, TSK-GEL G4000PWXL (Tosoh Bioscience) and Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare), with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Thirty fractions of 1 ml were collected and stored at 4 °C until use immediately after the fractionation was completed. The concentrations of Aβ monomer- and oligomer-enriched SEC-HPLC fractions were measured by absorbance at 280 nm in a glass cuvette. ELISA plates were coated for 2 h at 4 °C with SEC Monomer and Oligomer Aβ(1–42) preparations diluted in PBS to obtain 10 μg/ml concentrations. After coating, washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 was performed, followed by blocking with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Serial dilutions of sera were added to the plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing, plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 2 h at 37 °C. After final washing, plates were incubated with AP substrate para-nitrophenylphosphate for 2.5 h at room temperature and read at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Results are expressed by reference to serial dilutions of monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Covance). Prepared cryosections of human Alzheimer brain (cortex) tissue were used as a positive control tissue, whereas normal human brain (cortex) tissue was used as a negative control. The panel of human tissues was obtained from Tissue Solutions Ltd., and analyses were performed by Covance Laboratories Ltd. (Harrogate, UK). Mouse monoclonal antibody against β-amyloid (anti-human β-amyloid, M0872, Dako) was used as a positive control antibody. Monkey serum was used at 1:2000 dilution. Serum of one animal immunized with PBS was used as a negative control. A goat anti-monkey IgG (1:100 dilution) and a biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG were used to detect primary non-primate antibody. ∼5-μm-thick cryostat sections were prepared and fixed in acetone followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin. After washing, sections were incubated with Dako REAL serum blocking solution, Avidin solution, and Biotin solutions. Cryosections were incubated overnight with diluted sera and incubated with goat anti-monkey IgG, followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-goat. VECTASTAIN ABC/HRP and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride were used to detect antibody complexes. After staining, sections were washed and incubated with 0.5% copper sulfate solution, counterstained in hematoxylin, and mounted. All reagents were diluted in antibody diluents, and all incubation steps were preceded by washing in PBS and were performed at room temperature. The data were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon matched pair ranks. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. In order to investigate the structure-conformation relationship of liposomal tetrapalmitoylated peptides, a range of peptides were synthesized (Table 1), which differ in peptide sequence, length, and charge. The biophysical properties of these peptides either alone as “native” tetra-acetylated peptides or as tetrapalmitoylated peptides embedded into liposome bilayers were analyzed by various techniques.TABLE 1Different peptide sequences synthesized bearing N- and C-terminal palmitoyl or acetyl chainsNamePeptideLinkerPalm1–15H-K(X)-K(X)-DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQ-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylAcetyl1–15X = AcetylPalm15–1H-K(X)-K(X)-QHHVEYGSDHRFEAD-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylAcetyl15–1X = AcetylscPalm15H-K(X)-K(X)-GHEAYHSVERFDDQH-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylscAcetyl15X = AcetylPalm1–9H-K(X)-K(X)-DAEFRHDSG-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylAcetyl1–9X = AcetylPalm1–5H-K(X)-K(X)-DAEFR-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylAcetyl1–5X = AcetylPalm1–15(D7K)H-K(X)-K(X)-DAEFRHKSGYEVHHQ-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylAcetyl1–15(D7K)X = AcetylPalm1–15(E3A,D7K)H-K(X)-K(X)-DAAFRHKSGYEVHHQ-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylAcetyl1–15(E3A,D7K)X = AcetylPalm1–15(E3K,D7K)H-K(X)-K(X)-DAKFRHKSGYEVHHQ-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylAcetyl1–15(E3K,D7K)X = AcetylPalm1–15(E3K,D7K,E11K)H-K(X)-K(X)-DAKFRHKSGYKVHHQ-K(X)-K(X)-OHX = PalmitoylAcetyl1–15(E3K,D7K,E11K)X = Acetyl Open table in a new tab Previously, we reported that Palm1–15 (Table 1) adopts a β-sheet conformation within the lipid bilayer of ACI-24 (27Muhs A. Hickman D.T. Pihlgren M. Chuard N. Giriens V. Meerschman C. van der Auwera I. van Leuven F. Sugawara M. Weingertner M.C. Bechinger B. Greferath R. Kolonko N. Nagel-Steger L. Riesner D. Brady R.O. Pfeifer A. Nicolau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9810-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To explore if this conformation induces aggregation, we measured fluorescence of ThT upon the addition to ACI-24. ThT is a small benzothiazole dye that exhibits a strong red shift in its emission spectrum upon binding to aggregated β-sheet peptides (30LeVine 3rd, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 31Khurana R. Coleman C. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Krishna V. Grover R.K. Roy R. Singh S. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). As such, it has been widely used to detect and characterize the aggregation of β-amyloid peptides into both oligomers (32Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Liu R. Wu C.Y. Cheng R.H. Kung M.P. Kung H.F. Lam K.S. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Jin L.W. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and fibers (33Groenning M. J. Chem. Biol. 2010; 3: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The addition of ThT to ACI-24 gave rise to a strong fluorescence emission at 485 nm, characteristic of the emission spectra for β-sheet aggregated amyloid (Fig. 1A). No emission above background was observed over the same range in the presence of liposomes lacking peptide (“empty” liposomes), confirming that the liposome matrix did not cause interference. Because Palm1–15 peptide is highly insoluble in PBS, an acetylated and PBS-soluble version, “Acetyl1–15” peptide was synthesized and analyzed; however, this showed no emission at 485 nm in the presence of ThT (Fig. 1A). For Palm1–15 in liposomes, the fluorescence response value at saturation Bmax and the apparent Kd value of 2.4 μm were estimated by fitting the fluorescence emission at 485 nm upon the addition of ThT at different concentrations to Palm1–15 (ACI-24) (Fig. 1B). This apparent Kd value is consistent with that reported for the interaction of ThT with Aβ(1–40) (11 μm) (34Levine 3rd, H. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1995; 2: 1-6Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). ThT data were in agreement with the CD spectra, which show that the liposomal Palm1–15 adopts a β-sheet secondary structure, whereas “native” Acetyl1–15 peptide alone is unstructured in PBS solution (Fig. 1C). Thus, within the liposomal formulation of ACI-24, Palm1–15 forms β-sheet aggregates that are tinctorially similar to β-amyloid. Based upon liposomes of 100-nm diameter with 5-nm thick bilayers and standard lipid headgroup areas, we calculate that, on average, each liposome contains ∼335 peptides, assuming a random distribution of peptide between liposomes covering a minor portion of the surface. In order to further examine the similarities between Palm1–15 and Aβ(1–42) aggregates and to better understand the mechanism of β-sheet assembly upon incorporation into lipid bilayers, we investigated whether preformed β-sheet aggregates of liposomal Palm1–15 could be disaggregated by Cu(II), as reported for Aβ(1–42) fibers (35House E. Mold M. Collingwood J. Baldwin A. Goodwin S. Exley C. J. Alzheimers. Dis. 2009; 18: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To this end, ACI-24 was incubated with CuCl2 for 2 h and then analyzed by ThT. Likewise, the effect of adding ZnCl2 and FeCl3 was investigated. Fig. 1D shows that at near stoichiometric concentrations of metal/peptide, the ThT fluorescence is decreased by ∼75% upon the addition of Cu(II), whereas only ∼12% reduction was observed with Zn(II) and none with Fe(III). A shorter incubation time of just 5 min revealed a similar reduction upon the addition of Cu(II), whereas an EC50 value for Cu(II) disaggregation of ∼3 μm was determined. When the metal chelator diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid was added to the metal-liposome solution instead of PBS alone, analysis by ThT fluorescence revealed an increase in fluorescence, similar to that found prior to the addition of Cu(II). These data reveal that Palm1–15 is disaggregated by Cu(II) and can reassemble within the lipid bilayer post-liposome formation to form aggregates comparable with those formed prior to Cu(II)-induced disassembly. The ability of Cu(II) to disaggregate Palm1–15 β-sheets thus further highlights the similarities between Palm1–15 aggregates and Aβ(1–42) aggregates. In order to determine whether the formation of β-sheet aggregates of liposomal Palm1–15 was related to the peptide sequence in Aβ1–15, the unrelated reverse sequence Palm15–1 and scrambled sequence scPalm15 were synthesized (Table 1). These peptides were then incorporated into liposomes as for ACI-24 and analyzed by CD spectroscopy. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, both liposomal peptides Palm15–1 and scPalm15 show minimal mean residue molar ellipticities at ∼220 nm. These spectra are similar to that found for liposomal Palm1–15 and characteristic of a β-sheet conformation. In contrast, the tetra-acetylated peptides Acetyl15–1 and scAcetyl15, corresponding to the sequences from Palm15–1 and scPalm15, were synthesized and upon analysis by CD were found to adopt random coil conformations (supplemental Fig. S1). When analyzed by ThT fluorescence, positive ThT emission signals were observed, whereas the corresponding acetylated peptides Acetyl15–1 and scAcetyl15 alone (native peptides) showed no fluorescence (Fig. 2B). Thus, the aggregation observed for Palm1–15 is not unique to the Aβ1–15 amino acid sequence but also occurs for other unrelated sequences upon peptide palmitoylation and incorporation into liposomes. Slight differences in fluorescence intensity were nevertheless observed between liposomal peptides Palm1–15, Palm15–1, and scPalm15 (Fig. 2B) despite similar binding affinities for ThT (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S3), suggesting that the peptide sequence has only a minor influence on the extent of β-sheet aggregation. Because the binding epitope within Aβ(1–42) of sera taken from mice immunized with ACI-24 was found to be in the region Aβ1–9 (27Muhs A. Hickman D.T. Pihlgren M. Chuard N. Giriens V. Meerschman C. van der Auwera I. van Leuven F. Sugawara M. Weingertner M.C. Bechinger B. Greferath R. Kolonko N. Nagel-Steger L. Riesner D. Brady R.O. Pfeifer A. Nicolau C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9810-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we next decided to investigate the effect of peptide length on conformation. To this end, the truncated peptides Palm1–9 and Palm1–5 were synthesized (Table 1). Upon incorporation into liposomes, peptide Palm1–9 was found to form β-sheet aggregates by CD (Fig. 2A) similar to liposomal peptide Palm1–15 (Fig. 1A). On the contrary, lipopeptide Palm1–5 was found to give a CD spectrum consistent with a mixed proportion of extended β-sheet and random coil conformations. This was supported by ThT binding data showing lower ThT fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B) and a lower Bmax value for liposomal peptide Palm1–5 compared with Palm1–15 or Palm1–9 (supplemental Table S2 and Fig S3). In summary, even short tetrapalmitoylated peptides generate β-sheet aggregates within the liposome bilayers, but with a minimal length of at least 5 amino acids. To examine whether the preference for β-sheet formation would still arise for peptides with different net charges at physiological pH, we decided to synthesize a range of Aβ1–15 mutants (Palm1–15(D7K), Palm1–15(E3A,D7K), Palm1–15(E3K,D7K), and Palm1–15(E3K,D7K,E11K)), wherein different numbers of acidic amino acids within Aβ1–15 were replaced by either basic Lys or neutral Ala residues (Table 1). In this way, it was possible to create a series of peptides with very different isoelectric points ranging from 5.2 to 10.0 (supplemental Table S1), such that they carry net negative, neutral, and positive charges at physiological pH. These different peptides were then incorporated into liposomes carrying a negative surface charge as for ACI-24. CD spectroscopic analyses of these liposomal peptides revealed characteristic minima at ∼220 nm (Fig. 2C) indicative of β-sheet secondary structure. These findings were supported by ThT analyses, whic"

Here, we report that the suppressed expression of DAPIT in DAPIT-knockdown HeLa cells causes loss of the population of ATP synthase in mitochondria. Consequently, DAPIT-knockdown cells show smaller mitochondrial ATP synthesis activity, slower growth in normal medium, and poorer viability in glucose-free medium than the control cells. The mRNA levels of α- and β-subunits of ATP synthase remain unchanged by DAPIT knockdown. These results indicate a critical role of DAPIT in maintaining the ATP synthase population in mitochondria and raise an intriguing possibility of active role of DAPIT in cellular energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2002935795,"We have generated a set of dual-reporter human cell lines and devised a chase protocol to quantify proteasomal degradation of a ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) substrate, a ubiquitin ligase CRL2(VHL) substrate, and a ubiquitin-independent substrate. Well characterized inhibitors that target different aspects of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can be distinguished by their distinctive patterns of substrate stabilization, enabling assignment of test compounds as inhibitors of the proteasome, ubiquitin chain formation or perception, CRL activity, or the UFD-p97 pathway. We confirmed that degradation of the UFD but not the CRL2(VHL) or ubiquitin-independent substrates depends on p97 activity. We optimized our suite of assays to establish conditions suitable for high-throughput screening and then validated their performance by screening against 160 cell-permeable protein kinase inhibitors. This screen identified Syk inhibitor III as an irreversible p97/vasolin containing protein inhibitor (IC(50) = 1.7 μM) that acts through Cys-522 within the D2 ATPase domain. Our work establishes a high-throughput screening-compatible pipeline for identification and classification of small molecules, cDNAs, or siRNAs that target components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system."

These complex proteins are activated by the endogenous neurotransmitter ACh as well as by nicotine and structurally related agonists. Activation and modulation of nAChRs has been implicated in the pathology of multiple neurological disorders, and as such, these proteins are established therapeutic targets. Here we use unnatural amino acid mutagenesis to examine the ligand binding mechanisms of two homologous neuronal nAChRs: the α4β4 and α7 receptors. Despite sequence identity among the residues that form the core of the agonist-binding site, we find that the α4β4 and α7 nAChRs employ different agonist-receptor binding interactions in this region. The α4β4 receptor utilizes a strong cation-π interaction to a conserved tryptophan (TrpB) of the receptor for both ACh and nicotine, and nicotine participates in a strong hydrogen bond with a backbone carbonyl contributed by TrpB. Interestingly, we find that the α7 receptor also employs a cation-π interaction for ligand recognition, but the site has moved to a different aromatic amino acid of the agonist-binding site depending on the agonist.

These transmembrane proteins are essential for proper rapid synaptic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems (1Corringer P.J. Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). One or more nAChRs are implicated in pathophysiology and/or therapy of multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders including addiction, schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, depression, and congenital myasthenic syndromes (2Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 3Romanelli M.N. Gratteri P. Guandalini L. Martini E. Bonaccini C. Gualtieri F. Chem. Med. Chem. 2007; 2: 746-767Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The nAChR is the longest known, most studied neuroreceptor. Early work established a nicotinic pharmacophore comprised of a cationic N and a hydrogen bond-accepting group separated by an appropriate distance (4Beers W.H. Reich E. Nature. 1970; 228: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 5Glennon R.A. Dukat M. Pharm. Acta. Helv. 2000; 74: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This pharmacophore is also present in the potent agonist epibatidine and in cytisine, which has served as an important lead compound for discovery of new nicotinic drugs (6Dart M.J. Wasicak J.T. Ryther K.B. Schrimpf M.R. Kim K.H. Anderson D.J. Sullivan J.P. Meyer M.D. Pharm. Acta. Helv. 2000; 74: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the overall layout of the receptor has been delineated by cryo-electron microscopy images of the Torpedo californica nAChR (7Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar), the present work focuses on the agonist-binding site. Ligands bind at a subunit interface in the large, N-terminal, extracellular domain. A major advance in the field was the discovery and structural characterization of the family of snail acetylcholine-binding proteins, which share 20–25% sequence identity with the extracellular domain of the nAChR (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 9Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Annu Rev Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The cationic moiety of ACh interacts with a cluster of aromatic amino acids. These aromatic residues were first identified by photoaffinity labeling and mutagenesis experiments of the full receptor and subsequently located by the acetylcholine-binding protein crystal structures (1Corringer P.J. Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The binding site “aromatic box” is formed by five residues: four contributed by the “principal” subunit (TyrA, TrpB, TyrC1, and TyrC2) and one contributed from the “complementary” surface or subunit (TrpD), and these five aromatics are completely conserved within the nAChR family (Fig. 1). The hydrogen bond acceptor of the agonist interacts with residues from the complementary subunits (β in neuronal nAChRs and γ, δ, and ϵ in the muscle-type nAChR) (10Blum A.P. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13206-13211Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To date, 16 mammalian genes have been identified that encode nAChR subunits, termed α1–α7, α9, α10, β1–β4, δ, γ, and ϵ. The muscle-type nAChR, post-synaptically located at the neuromuscular junction, has a uniquely precise stoichiometry of (α1)2β1γδ (fetal form; the adult form is (α1)2β1δϵ). Most other nAChRs are located post- or pre-synaptically in autonomic ganglia and cholinergic neurons throughout the central nervous system; some of the so-called “neuronal” nAChRs, such as the α7 subtype studied in this paper, also occur on non-neuronal cells (2Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar,11Gotti C. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 363-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Neuronal nAChRs have variable stoichiometries formed from various combinations of α and β subunits (11Gotti C. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 363-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). This large collection of closely related receptors—current estimates are that as many as 25 nAChR subtypes are active in humans—presents special challenges to drug discovery efforts (3Romanelli M.N. Gratteri P. Guandalini L. Martini E. Bonaccini C. Gualtieri F. Chem. Med. Chem. 2007; 2: 746-767Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It seems certain that therapeutics directed toward specific neurological disorders will require selectivity in terms of which nAChR subtype(s) is targeted. In previous work, we have studied the muscle-type and neuronal α4β2 receptors (12Zhong W. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y. Li L. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 13Beene D.L. Brandt G.S. Zhong W. Zacharias N.M. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A.

Nature. 2009; 458: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Here we extend our studies of the principal component of the agonist-binding site to two other subtypes of the nAChR family, the neuronal α4β4 and α7 receptors. The α4 and β4 subunits colocalize in brain regions implicated in behavioral responses to nicotine, such as the medial habenula (2Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 16Wu J. Liu Q. Yu K. Hu J. Kuo Y.P. Segerberg M. St John P.A. Lukas R.J. J. Physiol. 2006; 576: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The β4 subunit is more commonly expressed with the α3 subunit, where it forms the major nAChR of autonomic ganglia, and a cluster of genes including the β4, α3, and α5 subunits are repeatedly identified in genome wide association studies and candidate gene studies that focus on nicotine dependence (2Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 17Improgo M.R. Scofield M.D. Tapper A.R. Gardner P.D. Prog. Neurobiol. 2010; 92: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether these associations arise from peripheral or central nervous system nAChRs. Further supporting the role of the β4 subunit in acute responses to nicotine, β4−/− knock-out mice are more resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared with wild type mice (2Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The pharmacology of the α4β4 nAChR differs markedly from that of the muscle-type and α4β2 receptors, providing a valuable comparison for the structure-function studies employed here. The homopentameric α7 nAChR is one of the most prevalent neuronal nAChR subtypes and is a potential therapeutic target in schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, and inflammation (18Martin L.F. Kem W.R. Freedman R. Psychopharmacology. 2004; 174: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 19O'Neill M.J. Murray T.K. Lakics V. Visanji N.P. Duty S. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol.

Nature. 2003; 421: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). These receptors are richly expressed in most forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions, as well as in some non-neuronal cells (2Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 21Trombino S. Cesario A. Margaritora S. Granone P. Motta G. Falugi C. Russo P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Brain expression is heaviest in the neonatal period, when the endogenous ligand may be choline; even in adults, most neurons exhibit ACh responses with characteristic α7 waveforms and pharmacology (22Court J.A. Lloyd S. Johnson M. Griffiths M. Birdsall N.J. Piggott M.A. Oakley A.E. Ince P.G. Perry E.K. Perry R.H. Brain Res. Dev.

Cortes W.S. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In neurons and heterologous expression systems, α7 nAChRs exhibit responses that desensitize within 10–100 ms (25Vijayaraghavan S. Pugh P.C. Zhang Z.W. Rathouz M.M. Berg D.K. Neuron. 1992; 8: 353-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), but even the peak α7 responses are less sensitive to agonists than are α4β2 or α4β4 responses (2Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 26Arneric S.P. Brioni J.D. Neuronal Nicotinic Receptors: Pharmacology and Therapeutic Opportunities. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Despite the widespread expression of the α7 nAChR, homozygous α7 knock-out mice are viable (27Orr-Urtreger A. Göldner F.M. Saeki M. Lorenzo I. Goldberg L. De Biasi M. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. Beaudet A.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9165-9171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse strains with low expression of α7 nAChRs provide a useful model for schizophrenia (28Stevens K.E. Freedman R.

Psychopharmacology. 1998; 136: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and α7 nAChRs may be activated by the high concentrations of nicotine that are produced by the heavy smoking habits of many schizophrenics (30Séguéla P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhang Z.W. Vijayaraghavan S. Berg D.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 167-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Here we use unnatural amino acid mutagenesis to investigate the ligand binding modes of the neuronal α4β4 and α7 nAChRs (Fig. 2). In the α4β4 receptor, we establish a strong cation-π interaction to a conserved tryptophan (TrpB) of the receptor for both ACh and nicotine. Nicotine also participates in a strong hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl contributed by TrpB. Overall, the binding patterns are similar to that reported for the α4β2 receptor (15Xiu X. Puskar N.L. Shanata J.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2009; 458: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The α7 receptor also employs a cation-π interaction for ligand recognition, but surprisingly, we find that the locus has moved to a different aromatic amino acid of the agonist-binding site depending on the agonist. ACh participates in a cation-π interaction with TyrA, whereas the nicotine analog epibatidine participates in a cation-π interaction with TyrC2. nAChR subunits of human α4 and β4 were in pGEMhe, whereas rat α7 was in pAMV. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). For nonsense suppression experiments, the site of interest within the nAChR subunit was mutated to an amber stop codon. Circular DNA for α4 and β4 was linearized with NheI. Circular α7 DNA was linearized with NotI. After purification (Qiagen), linearized DNA was used as a template for runoff in vitro transcription using T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). hRIC-3 cDNA in pGEM was obtained from Dr. Miller Treinin at Hebrew University. Circular hRIC-3 DNA was linearized with XhoI, and mRNA was prepared as previously described. THG73 (32Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Du F. Abelson J.N. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J.

The nitroveratryloxycarbonyl-protected cyanomethyl ester form of unnatural amino acids and α-hydroxythreonine cyanomethyl ester were synthesized, coupled to dinucleotide dCA, and enzymatically ligated to 74-nucleotide THG73 tRNACUA as previously reported (33Nowak M.W. Gallivan J.P. Silverman S.K. Labarca C.G. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 504-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Crude tRNA amino acid product was used without desalting, and the product was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS on 3-hydropicolinic acid matrix. Deprotection of the nitroveratryloxycarbonyl group on the tRNA-amino acid was carried out by photolysis for 5 min prior to co-injection with mRNA containing the UAG mutation at the site of interest. Stage V–VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were employed. Co-injection of α4:β4 mRNA at a ratio of 1:1 by mass or lower yielded wild type (α4)2(β4)3 receptors, whereas a ratio of 30:1 by mass or higher produced pure populations of (α4)3(β4)2. If an unnatural amino acid was to be incorporated into the α4 subunit to produce a (α4)2(β4)3 receptor, then a mass ratio of 2:1 for α4:β4 mRNA was injected into each oocyte. For α4β4 experiments, the total mRNA injected was 25–65 ng/oocyte depending on the relative expression level. For α7 T6′S experiments, 10–25 ng of α7 T6′S mRNA was co-injected with 20 ng of hRIC-3 mRNA per oocyte. For all of the suppression experiments, ∼15 ng of tRNA/cell was used. Each oocyte was injected with 50 nl of RNA solution, and the oocytes were incubated for 24–48 h at 18 C in culture medium (ND96+ with 2.5% horse serum). In the case of low expressing mutant receptors, a second injection was required 24 h after the first injection. As a negative control for all suppression experiments, 76-nucleotide tRNA (dCA ligated to 74-nucleotide tRNA) was co-injected with mRNA in the same manner as fully charged tRNA. Acetylcholine chloride and (−)-nicotine tartrate were purchased from Sigma/Aldrich/RBI, and drug dilutions were prepared from 1 m aq stock solutions. (±)-Epibatidine was purchased from Tocris, and drug dilutions were prepared from a 50 mm stock solution (1:1 H2O:EtOH). For α4β4 experiments, drug dilutions were prepared in calcium-free ND96 buffer. For α7 T6′S experiments, drug dilutions were prepared in calcium-containing ND96 buffer. Ion channel function was assayed using the OpusXpress 6000A (Molecular Devices Axon Instruments) in two-electrode voltage clamp mode. The oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of −60 mV. For α4β4 receptors, 1 ml of each drug solution was applied to the clamped oocytes for 12 s and followed by a 2-min wash with calcium-free ND96 buffer between each concentration. For α7 T6′S receptors, 1 ml of each drug solution was applied for 30 or 12 s, followed by a 5-min wash step with calcium-containing ND96 buffer between each concentration. The data were sampled at 125 Hz and filtered at 50 Hz. Dose-response data were obtained for at least six concentrations of agonists and for a minimum of five oocytes (from two different batches). Mutants with Imax of at least 100 nA of current were defined as functional. The EC50 and Hill coefficient (nH) values were calculated by fitting the averaged, normalized dose-response relation to the Hill equation. All of the data are reported as the means ± S.E. The nonsense suppression methodology for incorporating unnatural amino acids into receptors and ion channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes has proven to be broadly applicable, including studies of serotonin (5-HT3) receptors, GABA receptors, glycine receptors, K+ and Na+ channels, and G protein-coupled receptors such as the D2 dopamine and M2 muscarinic ACh receptors (13Beene D.L.

Studies of the muscle-type nAChR have long been straightforward, but attempts to apply the methodology to neuronal nAChRs were initially frustrated by several factors. These issues include poor expression in Xenopus oocytes and some intrinsic pharmacological properties of the receptors. Here, we report the strategies used to overcome these obstacles in both the α4β4 and α7 receptors. First, expression of the nAChRs in Xenopus oocytes yields variable stoichiometries. This can be problematic, because interpretation of subtle structure-function studies requires a homogeneous collection of receptors. Several studies of other receptor subtypes have shown that biasing the ratios of subunit mRNAs injected into the oocyte can influence subunit stoichiometry (15Xiu X. Puskar N.L. Shanata J.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2009; 458: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 38Moroni M. Zwart R. Sher E. Cassels B.K. Bermudez I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and we have found similar results in our previous studies of unnatural amino acids in the α4β2 receptor (15Xiu X. Puskar N.L.

For the α4β2 nAChR, the (α4)2(β2)3 form is the higher sensitivity form for nicotine, and chronic exposure to nicotine leads to up-regulation of this form at the expense of (α4)3(β2)2 in a variety of cell types (38Moroni M. Zwart R. Sher E. Cassels B.K. Bermudez I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 39Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Choi C.H. Zhou Y. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In initial studies of the α4β4 receptor, we observed variable dose-response curves and anomalously low Hill coefficients, indicating a mixed population of receptors. By biasing the subunit mRNA ratios, we observed two dominant α4β4 receptor populations, which we have assigned as (α4)2(β4)3 and (α4)3(β4)2. To facilitate comparisons and to emphasize the critical role of the β subunit in defining drug selectivity at nAChRs, our studies of the α4β4 nAChR have focused on the (α4)2(β4)3 form. We found that injection of an mRNA ratio α4:β4 of 1:1 or lower produces a pure population of (α4)2(β4)3, whereas a ratio of 30:1 or higher is necessary to produce pure populations of (α4)3(β4)2 (supplemental Table S1). Studies of the homopentameric α7 nAChR also presented several challenges, including poor expression and agonist concentration-dependent desensitization; the latter impedes accurate measurement of dose-response relations. To overcome the issue of poor expression, we co-expressed the α7 nAChR with the human homolog of the RIC-3 protein (hRIC-3). Other studies have shown that co-expression with hRIC-3 enhances surface expression of α7 nAChRs, presumably by aiding the folding, assembly, and/or trafficking of the α7 protein (40Halevi S.

Previous work established that this mutation, which lies ∼60 Å from the agonist-binding site, decreases desensitization without disrupting other aspects of receptor pharmacology (45Placzek A.N. Grassi F. Meyer E.M. Papke R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All of the studies of the α7 receptor reported here include this mutation. Nicotine is not a potent agonist for α7 receptors; this complicates analyses of mutant receptors with elevated EC50 values. On the other hand, the important natural product and close nicotine analog epibatidine is a potent agonist at α7 nAChRs (Table 1). In addition, we have shown that epibatidine participates in the same kinds of interactions with specific residues as nicotine does in receptors at which nicotine is potent (10Blum A.P. Lester H.A.

In the present work, we report EC50 values, which indicate a functional measure that can be altered by changes in agonist affinity and/or receptor gating. All of our previous studies of the aromatic box of nAChRs have employed this metric, and so using EC50 measurements allows direct comparisons between different subtypes. In addition, an earlier study of the α4β2 receptor employed single-channel analysis to establish that shifts in EC50 caused by subtle mutations at TrpB, a major focus of the present work, result from changes in agonist affinity, not receptor gating (15Xiu X. Puskar N.L. Shanata J.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2009; 458: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Our lab has previously established that the muscle-type and α4β2 nAChRs interact with agonists through cation-π interactions at TrpB (12Zhong W. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y. Li L. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 15Xiu X. Puskar N.L. Shanata J.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2009; 458: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We therefore focused on TrpB in the α4β4 receptor using strategies that are now well established for identifying a cation-π interaction. In particular, we systematically fluorinate a side chain and determine whether the progressive diminution of the cation-π binding ability of the residue induced by fluorination is manifested in receptor function. The fluorination approach can be augmented with other substitutions, such as the highly deactivating cyano (CN) substituent, which is compared with the much less deactivating but sterically similar bromo substituent. With ACh as the agonist, both the 5-CN-Trp/5-bromo-tryptophan effect (9-fold ratio of EC50; Table 1 and supplemental Table S2) and the fluorination effect (Fig. 4A) establish that a cation-π interaction is present at TrpB. Efforts to incorporate 5,6,7-trifluoro-tryptophan or 4,5,6,7-tetrafluoro-tryptophan gave low expression yields, such that we were unable to achieve large enough signals with ACh as agonist but could do so with nicotine as agonist. To compensate for the lack of ACh data, we incorporated 7-aza-tryptophan, which is structurally very similar to Trp but shows a diminished cation-π binding ability. When all the data are combined (Trp, 5-fluoro-tryptophan, 5,7-difluoro-tryptophan, 7-aza-tryptophan, 5-bromo-tryptophan, and 5-CN-Trp) into one plot,"
https://openalex.org/W2017263658,"CD81 is a tetraspanin protein that is involved in several essential cellular functions, as well as in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. CD81 interacts with a high stoichiometry with its partner proteins EWI-2, EWI-2wint, and EWI-F. These latter proteins modify the functions of CD81 and can thereby potentially inhibit infection or modulate cell migration. Here, we characterized the cleavage of EWI-2 leading to the production of EWI-2wint, which has been shown to inhibit HCV infection. We determined the regions of EWI-2/EWI-2wint and CD81 that are important for their interaction and their functionality. More precisely, we identified a glycine zipper motif in the transmembrane domain of EWI-2/EWI-2wint that is essential for the interaction with CD81. In addition, we found that palmitoylation on two juxtamembranous cysteines in the cytosolic tail of EWI-2/EWI-2wint is required for their interaction with CD81 as well as with CD9, another tetraspanin. Thus, we have shown that palmitoylation of a tetraspanin partner protein can influence the interaction with a tetraspanin. We therefore propose that palmitoylation not only of tetraspanins, but also of their partner proteins is important in regulating the composition of complexes in tetraspanin networks. Finally, we identified the regions in CD81 that are necessary for its functionality in HCV entry and we demonstrated that EWI-2wint needs to interact with CD81 to exert its inhibitory effect on HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2077406513,"The activities of signaling pathways are critical for fungi to survive antifungal attack and to maintain cell integrity. However, little is known about how fungi respond to antifungals, particularly if these interact with multiple cellular targets. The antifungal protein AFP is a very potent inhibitor of chitin synthesis and membrane integrity in filamentous fungi and has so far not been reported to interfere with the viability of yeast strains. With the hypothesis that the susceptibility of fungi toward AFP is not merely dependent on the presence of an AFP-specific target at the cell surface but relies also on the cell's capacity to counteract AFP, we used a genetic approach to decipher defense strategies of the naturally AFP-resistant strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The screening of selected strains from the yeast genomic deletion collection for AFP-sensitive phenotypes revealed that a concerted action of calcium signaling, TOR signaling, cAMP-protein kinase A signaling, and cell wall integrity signaling is likely to safeguard S. cerevisiae against AFP. Our studies uncovered that the yeast cell wall gets fortified with chitin to defend against AFP and that this response is largely dependent on calcium/Crz1p signaling. Most importantly, we observed that stimulation of chitin synthesis is characteristic for AFP-resistant fungi but not for AFP-sensitive fungi, suggesting that this response is a successful strategy to protect against AFP. We finally propose the adoption of the damage-response framework of microbial pathogenesis for the interactions of antimicrobial proteins and microorganisms in order to comprehensively understand the outcome of an antifungal attack."
https://openalex.org/W2016895203,"The roles of monocytes/macrophages and their mechanisms of action in the regulation of pancreatitis are poorly understood. To address these issues, we have employed genetically altered mouse strains that either express the human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) coupled to the CD11b promoter or have global deletion of TNF-α. Targeted, conditional depletion of monocytes/macrophages was achieved by administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) to CD11b-DTR mice. We show that in the absence of DT administration, pancreatitis is associated with an increase in pancreatic content of Ly-6Chi monocytes/macrophages but that this response is prevented by prior administration of DT to CD11b-DTR mice. DT administration also reduces pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis in two dissimilar experimental models of acute pancreatitis (a secretagogue-induced model and a model elicited by retrograde pancreatic duct infusion of sodium taurocholate). In the secretagogue-elicited model, the DT-induced decrease in pancreatitis severity is reversed by adoptive transfer of purified Ly-6Chi monocytes harvested from non-DT-treated CD11b-DTR mice or by the transfer of purified Ly-6Chi monocytes harvested from TNF-α+/+ donor mice, but it is not reversed by the transfer of Ly-6Chi monocytes harvested from TNF-α−/− donors. Our studies indicate that the Ly-6Chi monocyte subset regulates the severity of pancreatitis by promoting pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis and that this phenomenon is dependent upon the expression of TNF-α by those cells. They suggest that therapies targeting Ly-6Chi monocytes and/or TNF-α expression by Ly-6Chi monocytes might prove beneficial in the prevention or treatment of acute pancreatitis.

The morbidity and mortality rates associated with acute pancreatitis are closely correlated with its morphological severity, but the processes that regulate pancreatitis severity are poorly understood. Previously reported studies have suggested that monocytes/macrophages might play an important role in regulating pancreatitis severity, but the methods employed in those studies to alter monocyte/macrophage number or function were relatively nonspecific and inefficient (1Shifrin A.L.

As a result, definitive mechanistic studies exploring these important issues have not been possible, the monocyte subset responsible for regulating pancreatitis severity has not been identified, and the critical factors involved in that regulatory process are unknown. In 2001, Saito et al. (9Saito M. Iwawaki T. Taya C. Yonekawa H. Noda M. Inui Y. Mekada E. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) showed that transgenic expression of the human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) 2The abbreviations used are: DTR, human diphtheria toxin receptor; DT, diphtheria toxin; BMC, bone marrow cell; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell. in mice followed by administration of diphtheria toxin to those animals could be used to achieve targeted and conditional DT-induced cell injury. Human and mouse DTRs bind DT with widely differing affinities (the mouse with very low and the human with very high affinity) and, as a result, human cells are rapidly killed by exposure to even very low concentrations of the toxin, whereas mouse cells are highly resistant. In our studies, we have employed a transgenic mouse strain (CD11b-DTR mice) that expresses DTR coupled to the CD11b promoter. Coupling expression of DTR to the CD11b promoter leads to the selective expression of DTR by mouse cells belonging to the granulocyte-macrophage lineage. Theoretically, both granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages would be expected to be killed following exposure of these mice to diphtheria toxin but, perhaps because of their relatively low rate of protein synthesis, granulocytes from CD11b-DTR mice survive exposure to the toxin and only monocytes/macrophages are depleted when CD11b-DTR mice are given very small amounts of DT (25 ng/g, i.p.) (10Duffield J.S. Forbes S.J. Constandinou C.M. Clay S. Partolina M. Vuthoori S. Wu S. Lang R. Iredale J.P. J. Clin.

Increasing evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies points to key roles for monocytes/macrophages in regulating the injury response in diverse tissues. In injury studies of heart, kidney, and muscle in which there is organ repair, monocytes/macrophages have been shown to play roles in both augmenting the initial injury and subsequently promoting repair (10Duffield J.S.

Circulation. 2007; 115: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To explain these diverse functions, it has been postulated that there are functional subsets of macrophages in the inflammatory tissue. Indeed, cultured macrophages or monocytes can be polarized by application of polarizing cytokines and known as M1 and M2 (14Mosser D.M. Edwards J.P. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 958-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar, 15Mantovani A. Sica A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Vecchi A. Locati M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 677-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). M1 macrophages evolve in response to interferon-γ and play a pro-inflammatory role, whereas M2 macrophages evolve in response to IL-4 or IL-13 and play a pro-reparative role. It was recently shown that in blood, there are functionally distinct subsets of monocytes delineated by the marker Ly-6C (16Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S. Sarnacki S. Cumano A. Lauvau G. Geissmann F. Science. 2007; 317: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Ly-6Chi monocytes are released from bone marrow in response to distant organ injury and traffic directly to the injured site (16Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S. Sarnacki S. Cumano A. Lauvau G. Geissmann F. Science. 2007; 317: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). These Ly-6Chi monocytes are believed to play important roles in initial responses to tissue injury, whereas Ly-6Clo monocytes may play a role in tissue repair. It has recently been suggested that the Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes correspond to M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 17Geissmann F. Manz M.G. Jung S. Sieweke M.H. Merad M. Ley K. Science. 2010; 327: 656-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar), but that remains to be confirmed. In recent studies, we have demonstrated that the Ly-6Chi monocytes traffic to chronically injured kidney, where they differentiate into pro-injurious Ly-6Chi macrophages but also into Ly-6Clo pro-fibrotic macrophages (18Lin S.L. Castaño A.P. Nowlin B.T. Lupher Jr., M.L. Duffield J.S. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 6733-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The role of Ly-6Chi or Ly-6Clo monocytes or macrophages in pancreatic injury remains unknown, however. The studies described here have employed selective depletion of monocytes/macrophages achieved by administration of DT to CD11b-DTR mice and selective repletion of monocytes/macrophages in those mice achieved by adoptive transfer of monocytes harvested from naive donor mice to (a) identify the role played by monocytes/macrophages in regulating acute pancreatitis severity, (b) define the monocyte subset that is involved in this process, and (c) explore the possibility that monocytes/macrophages might regulate pancreatitis severity by a mechanism that involves generation of TNF-α. Our studies are the first to unequivocally show that monocytes belonging to the Ly-6Chi subset exert a profound pro-injurious effect in acute pancreatitis and the first to show that they do so by generating TNF-α. FVB/N mice (20–25 g) were used in all experiments. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the animals used had been transgenically modified to express DTR coupled to the CD11b promoter as described previously (10Duffield J.S. Forbes S.J. Constandinou C.M. Clay S. Partolina M. Vuthoori S. Wu S. Lang R. Iredale J.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). In selected experiments, FVB/N mice with global deletion of TNF-α expression (kindly provided by Dr. A. K. Verma, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) were also employed. All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tufts Medical Center. Secretagogue-induced pancreatitis was elicited by administering 12 hourly intraperitoneal injections of the cholecystokinin analog caerulein (50 μg/kg/injection) (19Lampel M. Kern H.F. Virchows Arch. A. Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1977; 373: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Bile acid-induced pancreatitis was elicited by retrogradely infusing sodium taurocholate (50 μl, 37 mm) into the pancreatic duct of anesthetized mice as described previously by our group (20Laukkarinen J.M. Van Acker G.J. Weiss E.R. Steer M.L. Perides G. Gut. 2007; 56: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The severity of pancreatitis in both models is maximal 12 h after the start of induction and persists at this level for at least an additional 12 h (21Frossard J.L. Hadengue A. Spahr L. Morel P. Pastor C.M. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Van Acker G.J. Perides G. Weiss E.R. Das S. Tsichlis P.N. Steer M.L. J. Biol.

Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, mice were sacrificed to evaluate pancreatitis severity 24 h after the start of induction. At that time, blood was harvested for measurement of serum amylase activity, and pancreas samples were prepared for evaluation of pancreatic edema (defined as pancreatic water content above that observed in untreated control animals), pancreatic inflammation (defined as an increase in pancreatic myeloperoxidase content), and acinar cell injury/necrosis (defined as morphologic changes in hematoxylin/eosin-stained samples noted by an observer unaware of sample identity) as described previously (23Laukkarinen J.M. Weiss E.R. van Acker G.J. Steer M.L. Perides G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20703-20712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase content was quantitated by ELISA (Hycult Biotechnology Uden, Netherlands). Acinar cell injury/necrosis was expressed as a percentage of total acinar cell mass. Preliminary experiments 3G. Perides, unpublished results. showed that (a) DT administration to wild-type FVB/N mice does not alter the severity or course of pancreatitis; (b) pancreatitis is slightly more severe and consistent in female, as opposed to male, mice; and (c) the effects of DT administration are the same in both sexes. For these reasons, only female mice were used to quantitate pancreatitis severity, whereas mice of either sex were used as donors in adoptive transfer experiments. CD11b-DTR mice were given DT (25 ng/g i.p.) 16 h before the start of pancreatitis induction. Previously published studies (10Duffield J.S. Forbes S.J. Constandinou C.M. Clay S. Partolina M.

To isolate cells from the pancreas, the gland was cut into fragments (<0.5 mm3) that were suspended in FACS buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 10% calf serum and 5 mm EDTA). The fragments were triturated using a 1-ml pipette with an opening diameter of 0.5 mm, and the remaining large fragments were allowed to sediment for 15 s. The supernatant was harvested and reserved, whereas the sedimented large fragments, resuspended in FACS buffer, were again triturated. The resulting supernatant, combined with the reserved initial supernatant, was filtered through a Nitex filter (40 μm, Sefar America, Kansas City, MO) and centrifuged (250 × g, 4 °C, 25 min). The resulting pellet was then resuspended in FACS buffer for immediate use. In preliminary experiments, we found that this method of cell isolation yields single-cell suspensions that are of more consistent composition but the same numbers of leukocytes when compared with a method that involves collagenase digestion of the gland. For the isolation of bone marrow cells (BMC), bone marrow was harvested from femurs and tibias under sterile conditions and suspended in FACS buffer. The samples were triturated and resuspended in 5 ml of FACS buffer to obtain single cell suspensions. For isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), whole blood (0.5–0.8 ml) was used, and it was diluted with an equal volume of FACS buffer. Both the BMC and the PBMC samples were layered over a 2-ml cushion of Histopaque (1.083 g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and sedimented by centrifugation (30 min, 250 × g). The cells were harvested from the buffer-Histopaque interphase, washed in FACS buffer, resedimented, and used immediately. Isolated cells were preincubated with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 10 min and then, at 4 °C, with specific antibodies conjugated with fluorescein (FITC), R-phycoerythrin, peridinin chlorophyll protein, and/or allophycocyanin. To determine cut-off values and true positive staining, cells were incubated with isotypic control antibodies conjugated with the same fluorophores (BD Biosciences). Immunostained cells were subjected to flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Adoptive transfer was performed using either PBMC or BMC preparations. Unless otherwise stated, adoptive transfer studies involved infusing 300 μl of FACS buffer containing 106 PBMCs or BMCs, obtained from single donor mice, into the lateral tail vein of each recipient mouse. In preliminary studies characterizing the CD45+ cells in those preparations, we found that they were predominantly composed of CD11b+ cells but that they also contained CD90.2+ T-cells (0.6 ± 0.3% of PBMCs, 13.5 ± 0.8% of BMCs), CD45R+ B-cells (14.5 ± 1.6% of PBMCs, 32.7 ± 3.0% of BMCs), and NK1.1+ natural killer cells (9.1 ± 1.4% of PBMCs, 15.3 ± 0.9% of BMCs). For this reason, in selected experiments, recipient FVB/N CD11b-DTR mice were adoptively transferred with monocytes that had been either depleted or enriched with monocytes of the Ly-6Chi subset and/or depletion of Ly-6G+ cells (i.e. granulocytes). Depletion and enrichment were achieved by either negative or positive selection cell sorting using anti-Ly-6C and/or anti-Ly-6G antibodies. Negative selection was achieved using biotinylated anti-Ly-6C (clone AL-21) antibodies and streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (IMag, BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric analysis of the resulting sample indicated that this method achieved more than 95% reduction of Ly-6C+ cells (from 27.5 to 1.3%) and more than 99% reduction of the CD11b+7/4+Ly-6C+ cells (from 11.06 to only 0.04%). Positive selection was achieved by FACS, and the resulting sample was, by definition, composed entirely of Ly-6C+ or Ly-6Chi monocytes. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. values. They report results obtained from at least three, and usually more, independently evaluated animals in each group. The significance of differences was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t test for paired values and one-way analysis of variance when multiple groups were being compared. Significant differences were defined as those with p < 0.05. To allow for pooling of data from multiple animals, data from flow cytometric studies quantitating BMCs were expressed as “percentage of CD45+ cells.” Those from studies quantitating cells extracted from the pancreas were expressed as “number of cells per total pancreas.” Preliminary studies were performed using immunohistochemistry to quantitate monocytes/macrophages (i.e. F4/80+ cells) in the pancreas during pancreatitis (see supplemental Fig. 1). Those studies indicated that monocytes/macrophages are increased within the pancreas within 24 h of pancreatitis induction. To further characterize this process and permit identification of monocyte/macrophage subsets, we chose to extract intra-pancreatic leukocytes from the pancreas and evaluate those cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1, very few Ly-6Chi monocytes/macrophages are found in the untreated mouse pancreas, but the number of Ly-6Chi monocytes/macrophages found in the pancreas is markedly increased 24 h after the start of pancreatitis induction. At the same time, after the start of pancreatitis induction, the number of bone marrow Ly-6Chi monocytes is decreased, and the number of blood Ly-6Chi monocytes is increased (Fig. 1). This pattern of Ly-6Chi monocyte/macrophage distribution is compatible with the conclusion that those cells are mobilized from the bone marrow and traffic, via the circulating blood, to the pancreas during induction of pancreatitis. Our preliminary immunohistochemical studies indicated that DT administration to CD11b-DTR mice prevents the pancreatitis-associated increase in monocytes/macrophages (i.e. F4/80+ cells) in the pancreas (see supplemental Fig. 1). To further characterize the effects of DT administration, all of our subsequent studies employed flow cytometry. Those studies indicate that in the absence of pancreatitis, DT administration to CD11b-DTR mice leads to a reduction in the number of bone marrow and blood Ly-6Chi monocytes (Fig. 1, B and C). As shown in Fig. 1D, this reduction in bone marrow and blood content of Ly-6Chi monocytes occurs rapidly (i.e. <6 h) after DT administration and persists for at least 24 h. Importantly, DT administration also prevents the pancreatitis-associated rise in pancreatic Ly-6Chi monocyte/macrophage content (Fig. 1A) and significantly reduces the pancreatitis-associated rise in blood Ly-6Chi monocyte content (Fig. 1C), but it does not further reduce the pancreatitis-associated reduction in bone marrow Ly-6Chi monocyte content (Fig. 1B). These observations are compatible with the conclusion that DT administration to CD11b-DTR mice prevents trafficking of Ly-6Chi monocytes to the pancreas via the blood during induction of pancreatitis by depleting Ly-6Chi monocytes in the bone marrow. Pancreatitis was induced in CD11b-DTR mice either by giving repeated (12×) hourly i.p. doses of the cholecystokinin analog caerulein (50 μg/kg/injection) (19Lampel M. Kern H.F. Virchows Arch. A. Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1977; 373: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A) or by retrogradely infusing the bile salt sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct (20Laukkarinen J.M. Van Acker G.J. Weiss E.R. Steer M.L. Perides G. Gut. 2007; 56: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Both models are characterized by pancreatic edema, hyperamylasemia, pancreatic inflammation, and acinar cell injury/necrosis, which are maximal 12 h after the start of pancreatitis induction and remain constant in severity over the ensuing 12 h (21Frossard J.L. Hadengue A. Spahr L. Morel P. Pastor C.M. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Van Acker G.J. Perides G. Weiss E.R. Das S. Tsichlis P.N. Steer M.L. J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 20703-20712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When administered, DT was given 16 h prior to induction of pancreatitis. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, DT administration to CD11b-DTR mice significantly reduces the extent of pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis in both models, but it does not alter the extent of pancreatic inflammation or hyperamylasemia in either model. Furthermore, DT administration does not have any effect in the caerulein-induced trypsinogen activation (supplemental Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2C, pancreatitis-associated edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis are reduced when pancreatitis is induced 1 day after DT administration but not when pancreatitis is induced 4 or 7 days after DT administration. These observations are compatible with the conclusion that DT administration to CD11b-DTR mice reduces the severity of pancreatic injury (i.e. edema and injury/necrosis), but not hyperamylasemia or pancreatic inflammation, in these two dissimilar models of acute experimental pancreatitis. As shown in Fig. 3, the reduction in both pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis (i.e. measures of pancreatitis severity) that follows DT administration to CD11b-DTR mice is reversed when those mice are adoptively transferred with either PBMCs or BMCs isolated from naive donor mice. Dose-response studies indicate that complete restoration of pancreatitis severity is achieved by the adoptive transfer of 106 cells, whereas lesser numbers of transferred cells do not completely reverse the decrease in pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis that follows DT administration (see supplemental Fig. 3). Neither i.p. adoptive transfer of PBMCs nor adoptive transfer of PBMCs harvested from DT-treated donor mice restores pancreatitis severity. Restoration of pancreatitis severity is also observed after adoptive transfer of BMCs enriched in Ly-6C+ monocytes, but restoration of pancreatitis severity is not observed when Ly-6C+ cells are removed from the BMCs prior to adoptive transfer. Most importantly, pancreatitis severity is also restored when FACS-purified Ly-6Chi monocytes are adoptively transferred to the DT-treated recipient mice. The effects of DT administration, pancreatitis, and adoptive transfer of either BMCs or PBMCs on the pancreatic content of Ly-6Chi monocytes/macrophages were evaluated in experiments reported in Fig. 4. As already shown (Fig. 1A), pancreatitis induction in the absence of DT administration is associated with a marked rise in the pancreatic content of Ly-6Chi monocytes, and this rise is prevented by prior administration of DT. As shown in Fig. 4, adoptive transfer of either BMCs or PBMCs to DT-treated mice prevents this effect of DT administration, and the pancreatic content of Ly-6Chi monocytes in DT-treated mice after adoptive transfer is not different from that observed in non-DT-treated animals. Taken together, the observations reported in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 unequivocally indicate that the severity of pancreatitis is critically dependent upon the presence of the Ly-6Chi monocyte subset. Pancreatitis severity is reduced when those cells are depleted by DT treatment of CD11b-DTR mice, and pancreatitis severity is restored when DT-treated mice are adoptively transferred with Ly-6Chi monocytes. They suggest that DT treatment reduces pancreatitis severity by preventing the appearance of Ly-6Chi monocytes/macrophages in the pancreas during pancreatitis. The severity of pancreatitis is reduced in FVB/N mice with global deletion of TNF-α expression (Fig. 5A). Although the severity of pancreatitis is not restored in TNF-α−/− mice by adoptive transfer of Ly-6ChiLy6G− monocytes harvested from TNF-α−/− mice, pancreatitis severity is restored in those TNF-α−/− mice when they are adoptively transferred with Ly-6ChiLy6G− monocytes harvested from TNF-α+/+ (wild-type) mice (Fig. 5A). The severity of pancreatitis is also reduced in FVB/N CD11b-DTR mice that have been pretreated with DT, and the severity of pancreatitis in those DT-treated mice is restored by adoptive transfer of FACS-purified Ly-6ChiLy6G− monocytes harvested from TNF-α+/+ mice (Fig. 5B). In agreement with these results, DT administration leads to reduced TNF-α levels during acute pancreatitis, but adoptive transfer restored the levels of TNF-α present in the pancreas (supplemental Fig. 4). In contrast, the severity of pancreatitis in the DT-pretreated mice is not restored when those mice are adoptively transferred with purified Ly-6ChiLy6G− monocytes harvested from TNF-α−/− mice (Fig. 5B). These observations indicate that the ability of Ly-6Chi monocytes to regulate pancreatitis severity and, thus, to restore pancreatitis severity after DT treatment of CD11b-DTR mice is dependent upon the ability of those monocytes to express TNF-α. Furthermore, because FACS was used to positively select for Ly-6Chi cells and to eliminate Ly-6G+ cells in these studies, our findings exclude the possibility that contaminating Ly-6G+ granulocytes in the Ly-6Chi cell fraction could account for the observed restoration of pancreatitis severity. At least two distinct monocyte subsets have been identified: a “resident monocyte” subset with the Ly-6CloCX3CR1hi phenotype and an “inflammatory monocyte” subset with the Ly-6ChiCX3CR1lo phenotype (24Geissmann F. Jung S. Littman D.R. Immunity. 2003; 19: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar). Monocytes are believed to enter the circulation from the bone marrow as inflammatory monocytes and, in the absence of an inflammatory stimulus, these cells are thought to be transformed, within the circulating blood compartment, into resident monocytes. Auffray et al. (16Auffray C. Fogg D. Garfa M. Elain G. Join-Lambert O. Kayal S. Sarnacki S. Cumano A. Lauvau G. Geissmann F. Science. 2007; 317: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar) have suggested that resident monocytes patrol endothelial surfaces and react to inflammatory stimuli as local “first responders.” In the absence of inflammation, however, they enter and populate non-inflamed tissues as resident tissue macrophages. The onset of an inflammatory state, on the other hand, triggers the generation of factors that can accelerate mobilization of inflammatory monocytes from the bone marrow and promote their direct trafficking to inflamed tissues, where they function as inflammatory macrophages. The course and outcome of an acute pancreatitis attack are directly related to the severity of that attack, so much so that virtually all of the morbidity and mortality of pancreatitis is limited to patients with a severe attack. Despite the obvious clinical importance of severity in clinical pancreatitis, the factors that regulate pancreatitis severity are poorly understood. Although previous studies have suggested that monocytes/macrophages might play an important role in regulating pancreatitis severity (1Shifrin A.L. Chirmule N. Zhang Y. Raper S.E. Surgery. 2005; 137: 545-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Norman J.G. Fink G.W. Franz M.G. Arch.

Surg. 2000; 4: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the ability of those studies to address issues related to specific monocyte subsets and to address mechanistic issues was quite limited. To overcome those limitations, we have employed a highly efficient method of achieving targeted and conditional depletion of monocytes combined with modern techniques of flow cytometry, FACS, and adoptive transfer to address these issues. Our studies have focused on the Ly-6Chi monocyte subset because of studies by others that have indicated that those cells play important roles in regulating the severity of various other inflammatory states (18Lin S.L.

Our studies have also employed genetically modified mice to explore the role of TNF-α in the regulation of pancreatitis severity because of earlier studies that have suggested that TNF-α might play a pro-injurious role in acute pancreatitis (4Norman J.G. Fink G.W. Franz M.G. Arch. Surg. 1995; 130: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 7Denham W. Yang J. Fink G. Denham D. Carter G. Ward K. Norman J.

Pathol. 2000; 190: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The studies reported here indicate that Ly-6Chi monocytes are mobilized from the bone marrow to the pancreas during acute pancreatitis but that this phenomenon can be prevented if Ly-6Chi monocytes are depleted by administration of DT to CD11b-DTR mice (Fig. 1). Depletion of Ly-6Chi monocytes by DT administration prevents the pancreatitis-associated rise in pancreatic Ly-6Chi monocyte content, and this phenomenon is associated with a reduction in pancreatic injury (i.e. edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis) that occurs in two dissimilar experimental models of pancreatitis (Fig. 2). Our studies also show that both the rise in pancreatic Ly-6Chi monocyte content and the severity of pancreatic injury during pancreatitis can be restored by adoptive transfer of Ly-6Chi monocytes to DT-treated CD11b-DTR mice (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Taken together, our studies unequivocally indicate that Ly-6Chi monocytes play a critical pro-injurious role in regulating the severity of pancreatic injury during acute pancreatitis. To our knowledge, ours are the first studies that have explored the role of a distinct and well characterized monocyte subset, i.e. inflammatory monocytes, in the regulation of pancreatitis severity. It is interesting to note that although pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis during pancreatitis are markedly reduced by depletion of Ly-6Chi monocytes, pancreatitis-associated trypsinogen activation, hyperamylasemia, and pancreatic inflammation during pancreatitis were not altered when Ly-6Chi monocytes were depleted or when their rise within the pancreas during pancreatitis was prevented. These observations suggest that trypsinogen activation, hyperamylasemia, and pancreatic inflammation during pancreatitis are regulated by mechanisms that differ from those that regulate pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis, i.e. the latter by mechanisms involving Ly-6Chi monocytes/macrophages but the former by mechanisms that are not dependent on those cells. Previous studies reported by our group have also suggested that the various pancreatic manifestations of acute pancreatitis may be differentially regulated (22Van Acker G.J. Perides G. Weiss E.R. Das S. Tsichlis P.N. Steer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22140-22149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Studies reported by several other groups have indicated that TNF-α plays an important role in promoting pancreatic injury during pancreatitis by showing that pancreatitis severity can be reduced by global genetic deletion of TNF-α receptor (7Denham W. Yang J. Fink G. Denham D. Carter G. Ward K. Norman J. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1741-1746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), by administration of anti-TNF-α antibodies (33Grewal H.P. Mohey el Din A. Gaber L. Kotb M. Gaber A.O. Am. J. Surg. 1994; 167: 214-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), or by pharmacological interventions with agents known to abrogate the release of TNF-α (34Hughes C.B. el-Din A.B. Kotb M. Gaber L.W. Gaber A.O. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our own studies also support this conclusion by showing that pancreatitis severity is reduced by global genetic deletion of TNF-α (Fig. 5A). The source of the TNF-α that plays this important role in regulating pancreatic severity during pancreatitis has remained uncertain despite previous studies that have explored this issue. Norman and co-workers (4Norman J.G. Fink G.W. Franz M.G. Arch. Surg. 1995; 130: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 8Jaffray C. Mendez C. Denham W. Carter G. Norman J. J. Gastrointest. Surg. 2000; 4: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed that TNF-α expression in macrophages within the pancreas during pancreatitis is increased and that, under in vitro conditions, isolated macrophages generate TNF-α in response to exposure to activated pancreatic digestive enzymes. Those observations would suggest that the critical TNF-α that regulates pancreatitis severity is generated by macrophages. On the other hand, studies reported by Gukovskaya et al. (31Gukovskaya A.S. Gukovsky I. Zaninovic V. Song M. Sandoval D. Gukovsky S. Pandol S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) showed that pancreatic acinar cells can both generate and respond to TNF-α, suggesting that the critical TNF-α might be produced by acinar cells during evolution of acute pancreatitis. Our own findings, reported here, clearly favor the former of these two mechanisms. We found that pancreatic injury during pancreatitis is reduced by global genetic deletion of TNF-α and that the severity of pancreatitis in TNF-α−/− mice is restored when those animals are adoptively transferred with purified Ly-6Chi monocytes harvested from TNF-α+/+ (but not TNF-α−/−) donors (Fig. 5A). In addition, we found that the reduction in pancreatic injury that follows DT treatment of CD11b-DTR mice with DT is reversed when those DT-treated animals are adoptively transferred with purified Ly-6Chi monocytes harvested from TNF-α+/+ (but not TNF-α−/−) donors (Fig. 5B). Our studies do not challenge the possibility that pancreatic acinar cells (or other cells within the pancreas) may generate (and respond to) TNF-α during pancreatitis and that TNF-α contributes to pancreatic injury. They suggest that the TNF-α that regulates the extent of pancreatic injury (i.e. pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis) during pancreatitis arises primarily from Ly-6Chi inflammatory monocytes. It is tempting to speculate that those inflammatory monocytes generate TNF-α after first trafficking to the pancreas during pancreatitis, but our studies do not allow us to exclude the possibility that Ly-6Chi monocytes might generate the critical TNF-α after trafficking to other, non-pancreatic, sites during pancreatitis. We have shown that depletion of Ly-6Chi monocytes and genetic deletion of TNF-α cause comparable reductions in the magnitude of pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis during pancreatitis (edema by roughly 30–40%; injury/necrosis by roughly 50%) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 5). It is, perhaps, noteworthy that (a) the magnitude of these reductions in pancreatic injury brought about by either depletion of Ly-6Chi monocytes or ablation of TNF-α is similar and (b) neither depletion of Ly-6Chi monocytes nor ablation of TNF-α provides complete protection against injury during pancreatitis. Taken together, these observations lead us to speculate that in addition to TNF-α generated by Ly-6Chi monocytes, there are additional mechanisms responsible for the regulation of pancreatic injury during pancreatitis. Identification of those mechanisms would represent fertile ground for future studies exploring the mechanisms responsible for regulating pancreatitis severity. In summary, our studies indicate that pancreatic edema and acinar cell injury/necrosis, but not hyperamylasemia or pancreatic inflammation, during acute pancreatitis are regulated by the Ly-6Chi monocyte subset and that the ability of those cells to promote pancreatic injury during pancreatitis is dependent upon their ability to express TNF-α. Our observations suggest that Ly-6Chi monocytes and/or their expression of TNF-α may represent suitable targets for therapies designed to prevent or treat acute pancreatitis.

https://openalex.org/W2167155575,"The intracellular mechanisms underlying renal tubular epithelial cell proliferation and tubular repair following ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remain poorly understood. In this report, we demonstrate that activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3), an unconventional receptor-independent regulator of heterotrimeric G-protein function, influences renal tubular regeneration following IRI. In rat kidneys exposed to IRI, there was a temporal induction in renal AGS3 protein expression that peaked 72 h after reperfusion and corresponded to the repair and recovery phase following ischemic injury. Renal AGS3 expression was localized predominantly to the recovering outer medullary proximal tubular cells and was highly coexpressed with Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation. Kidneys from mice deficient in the expression of AGS3 exhibited impaired renal tubular recovery 7 d following IRI compared to wild-type AGS3-expressing mice. Mechanistically, genetic knockdown of endogenous AGS3 mRNA and protein in renal tubular epithelial cells reduced cell proliferation in vitro. Similar reductions in renal tubular epithelial cell proliferation were observed following incubation with gallein, a selective inhibitor of Gβγ subunit activity, and lentiviral overexpression of the carboxyl-terminus of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2ct), a scavenger of Gβγ subunits. In summary, these data suggest that AGS3 acts through a novel receptor-independent mechanism to facilitate renal tubular epithelial cell proliferation and renal tubular regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1978955492,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) is known to serve as a chylomicron remnant receptor in the liver responsible for the binding and plasma clearance of apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins. Previous in vitro studies have provided evidence to suggest that LRP1 expression may also influence high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. The current study showed that liver-specific LRP1 knock-out (hLrp1(-/-)) mice displayed lower fasting plasma HDL cholesterol levels when compared with hLrp1(+/+) mice. Lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase and hepatic lipase activities in plasma of hLrp1(-/-) mice were comparable with those observed in hLrp1(+/+) mice, indicating that hepatic LRP1 inactivation does not influence plasma HDL remodeling. Plasma clearance of HDL particles and HDL-associated cholesteryl esters was also similar between hLrp1(+/+) and hLrp1(-/-) mice. In contrast, HDL secretion from primary hepatocytes isolated from hLrp1(-/-) mice was significantly reduced when compared with that observed with hLrp1(+/+) hepatocytes. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins revealed decreased surface localization of the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) protein, but total cellular ABCA1 level was not changed in hLrp1(-/-) hepatocytes. Finally, hLrp1(-/-) hepatocytes displayed reduced binding capacity for extracellular cathepsin D, resulting in lower intracellular cathepsin D content and impairment of prosaposin activation, a process that is required for membrane translocation of ABCA1 to facilitate cholesterol efflux and HDL secretion. Taken together, these results documented that hepatic LRP1 participates in cellular activation of lysosomal enzymes and through this mechanism, indirectly modulates the production and plasma levels of HDL."
https://openalex.org/W1989262688,"Pathological angiogenesis usually involves disrupted vascular integrity, vascular leakage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, which are governed mainly by VEGF-A and TNF-α. Although many inhibitors targeting either VEGF-A or TNF-α have been developed, there is no single inhibitor molecule that simultaneously targets both molecules. Here, we designed and generated a novel chimeric decoy receptor (Valpha) that can simultaneously bind to VEGF-A and TNF-α and block their actions. In this experimental design, we have shown that Valpha, which is an effective synchronous blocker of VEGF-A and TNF-α, can drastically increase treatment effectiveness through its dual-blocking characteristics. Valpha contains the VEGF-A-binding domain of VEGFR1, the TNF-α-binding domain of TNFR2, and the Fc domain of IgG1. Valpha exhibited strong binding characteristics for its original counterparts, VEGF-A and TNF-α, but not for the extracellular matrix, resulting in a highly favorable pharmacokinetic profile in vivo. Compared with VEGF-Trap or Enbrel, both of which block either VEGF-A or TNF-α, singularly, Valpha is a highly effective molecule for reducing abnormal vascular tufts and the number of F4/80+ macrophages in a retinopathy model. In addition, Valpha showed superior relief effects in a psoriasis model with regard to epidermal thickness and the area of blood and lymphatic vessels.

IntroductionVEGF-A plays a key role in growth, migration, and survival of blood endothelial cells, which are essential processes for angiogenesis, specifically through the activation of VEGFR2 rather than VEGFR1 (1Ferrara N.

TNF-α mediates the immune response by recruiting leukocytes to the site of inflammation (15Hickey M.J. Reinhardt P.H. Ostrovsky L. Jones W.M. Jutila M.A. Payne D. Elliott J. Kubes P. J.

TNF-α is an important molecule in the initiation of inflammatory responses through activation of NF-κB in the inflammatory cells, including macrophages, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells (16Rojanasakul Y.

Therefore, Ig-like domain 2 of VEGFR1 per se might not be used as a therapeutic protein due to its poor pharmacokinetic properties (9Holash J. Davis S. Papadopoulos N. Croll S.D. Ho L. Russell M.

However, early vessel loss initiates retinopathy because of an inadequate blood supply resulting from vaso-obliteration, resulting in tissue hypoxia, which determines the severity of subsequent pathological vessel growth (28Chen J.

Pathological angiogenesis in the retina produces chaotically oriented growth of dysfunctional vessels that grow into the vitreous as vascular tufts and is accompanied by infiltration of various inflammatory cells, including macrophages, leaky vessels, and edema in the retina (26Saint-Geniez M.

The hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis is synovial cell proliferation in response to inflammatory stimuli, leading to formation of the rheumatoid pannus (6De Bandt M. Ben Mahdi M.H. Ollivier V. Grossin M. Dupuis M. Gaudry M. Bohlen P. Lipson K.E. Rice A. Wu Y. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Pasquier C. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 35Firestein G.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). One of the earliest events observed in synovitis is the development of new vessels in the synovium, and VEGF-A is strongly expressed by subsynovial macrophages, fibroblasts surrounding vessels, vascular smooth muscle cells, and synovial lining cells (6De Bandt M.

The VEGF-A expression level in synovial fluid and tissues correlates with the clinical severity of human rheumatoid arthritis and with the degree of joint destruction (35Firestein G.S.

Among other antirheumatic drugs, TNF-α inhibitors are widely used, and VEGF-A inhibitors have therapeutic potential as well (6De Bandt M. Ben Mahdi M.H. Ollivier V. Grossin M. Dupuis M. Gaudry M.

To address our hypothesis, we designed and generated a novel chimeric decoy receptor (Valpha) that can simultaneously bind to VEGF-A and TNF-α and block their actions. Valpha is an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of retinopathy and psoriasis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we developed a novel chimeric decoy receptor (Valpha) that can simultaneously block the actions of VEGF-A and TNF-α related to diseases caused by inflammatory angiogenesis. Although Valpha was generated by fusion of two ligand-binding domains from different receptors, the recombinant engineered product still has the binding capability of its original counterparts, VEGF-A and TNF-α. Also, we found that Valpha significant blocks VEGF-A and TNF-α, as shown in in vitro cell-based assays and in subsequent in vivo therapeutic trials for treatment of retinopathy and psoriasis in mice.To design the Valpha construct, we considered the minimum binding portion of original receptors and their biochemical characteristics. By fusion of the cysteine-rich domains of human TNFR2, Ig-like domain 2 of human VEGFR1, and the Fc domain of human IgG, we could generate a novel fusion protein that interacts with both VEGF-A and TNF-α with desirable biochemical profiles. Thus, the actual pI of Valpha is low enough to avoid attachment to the ECM, resulting in a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile in vivo compared with VEGF-Trap or Enbrel. Just as other therapeutic proteins have their unique pharmacokinetic profiles that lend to their critical factor of effectiveness, the low pI of Valpha is the key factor of importance. However, because VEGF-Trap and Enbrel have different biodistributions and half-lives in the body, they could not produce the same synergistic effects in the pathogenic environment. Furthermore, as a sole treatment agent, Valpha could be more cost-efficient for the patients than dual agents and will allow a more convenient administration of the treatment. Although Valpha has only a slightly better pharmacokinetic profile than Enbrel, the in vivo therapeutic effectiveness of Valpha was significantly better than that of Enbrel. In fact, our study showed that the effectiveness of Valpha was greater in anti-inflammatory, anti-edema, and anti-angiogenic activities than simultaneous therapy with VEGF-Trap and Enbrel. Thus, “double blockade” is the key factor responsible for the highly effective in vivo activity of Valpha. It is evident that Valpha has great benefits in relation to the engineered fusion antibody, which is a new trend in the current drug development field.When we treated TNF-α on primary cultured lymphatic endothelial cells, NF-κB was activated and translocated into the nucleus. Although treatment with VEGF-Trap did not show any significant effect, nuclear translocation of NF-κB was dramatically inhibited in the Enbrel- or Valpha-treated group. These data show that Valpha could trap TNF-α as a decoy receptor in the cultured media and that TNF-α cannot bind to and activate its receptor. Meanwhile, VEGF-A-induced migration of primary cultured endothelial cells was significantly reduced only in the VEGF-Trap- or Valpha-treated group and not in the Enbrel-treated group. Taking an approach similar to that in the cell-based experiment using TNF-α, Valpha could also act as a decoy receptor for VEGF-A. Therefore, we conclude that TNF-α and VEGF-A signaling pathways can be blocked by treatment with Valpha. Because of the promising results from cell-based functional assays in vitro, we next tested the in vivo effect of Valpha using mice disease models.Our results from the retinopathy experiment indicated that Valpha had an excellent therapeutic effect in reducing the number of abnormal vascular tufts, similar to VEGF-Trap. As abnormal vascular tufts are easily detected in pathological conditions of the retina, normalization of those irregular vessel structures reflects a quite favorable outcome of retinopathy treatment (28Chen J. Connor K.M. Aderman C.M. Smith L.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 526-533PubMed Google Scholar, 29Skoura A. Sanchez T. Claffey K. Mandala S.M. Proia R.L. Hla T. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 2506-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). From treatment outcomes of VEGF-Trap and Valpha, which have a common target to be sequestrated, VEGF-A, it was shown that blockade of VEGF-A signaling is enough to reduce pathological vascular tufts in retinopathy. Interestingly, the number of F4/80+ macrophages was significantly decreased in the Valpha-treated group, whereas the results in the VEGF-Trap- and Enbrel-treated groups were not significant different from those in the Fc-treated group. Therefore, single inhibition of VEGF-A or TNF-α separately is not sufficient for blockade of macrophage infiltration, but simultaneous blockade of both VEGF-A and TNF-α using Valpha is a promising strategy for blocking macrophage infiltration. Although the remaining macrophages in the Fc-, VEGF-Trap-, and Enbrel-treated groups might induce further pathological inflammatory responses in the retina and thereby accelerate disease progression, our data indicate that Valpha is more effective than VEGF-Trap or Enbrel for treating retinopathy in mice due to its ability to block macrophage infiltration. Also, there are several reports that a decoy receptor for VEGF-A repressed not only pathological but also physiological neovascularization, and so a single treatment with VEGF-Trap may not be the ideal method of retinopathy treatment (11Ng E.W. Shima D.T. Calias P. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Guyer D.R. Adamis A.P. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2006; 5: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 41Ishida S. Usui T. Yamashiro K. Kaji Y.

Thus, simultaneous blockade of both VEGF-A and TNF-α to reduce both abnormal vessels and macrophages should be considered in future application for efficient treatment of ocular diseases.In addition, we examined whether Valpha treatment could ameliorate chronic inflammation in a mouse model of psoriasis. The pathophysiology of psoriasis is not well understood, but increasing evidence indicates that TNF-α is a crucial cytokine implicated in psoriasis pathogenesis, and biological therapies targeting TNF-α have revolutionized the treatment of patients with severe psoriasis. Albeit very effective, these biological agents have little influence on the actual production of TNF-α by the immune cells or keratinocytes, which might be associated with recurrence of the disease after cessation of therapy (42Chua R.A. Arbiser J.L. Autoimmunity. 2009; 42: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, VEGF-A has been another focus of intense research in psoriasis pathogenesis and treatment. Patients with psoriasis show an increased expression of VEGF-A in both skin lesions and serum, and polymorphisms in VEGF and VEGFR genes are associated with psoriasis susceptibility, severity, and prognosis (42Chua R.A.

Teige I. Kvist P.H. Svensson L. Kemp K. Int. Immunol. 2008; 20: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite concurrent TPA challenges, Valpha produced a dramatic and significant improvement in epidermal hyperplasia compared with Fc, VEGF-Trap, and even Enbrel (Fig. 7E). Moreover, unlike VEGF-Trap-treated mice, which showed a significant decrease only in the area of blood vessels, Valpha-treated mice showed significant improvements in the area of blood and lymphatic vessels. In particular, Valpha was the only treatment that produced a significant improvement in the area of lymphatic vessels, even when blockade of either cytokine separately failed to produce a significant change. Thus, the double blockade of VEGF-A and TNF-α using Valpha is a far superior strategy than single blockade of either cytokine by normalizing epidermal thickness and vascular abnormalities. In addition to all the pathological benefits of Valpha, the high bioavailability and excellent pharmacokinetic profile of Valpha in vivo might even contribute to better efficacy because limited access to the target tissue of conventional drugs is a barrier to efficient treatment (45Kunstfeld R.

Brahn E. Nat. Clin. Pract. Rheumatol. 2007; 3: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of inflammatory angiogenesis using Valpha could be an effective method to reduce the progression and joint destruction of rheumatoid arthritis. Although we had originally expected that Valpha possessed a synergistic or additive effect in treatment of arthritis, there was no marked or observable difference in the effectiveness between Valpha and other single inhibitors. In general, the exact amounts and balance of VEGF-A and TNF-α affecting the pathogenesis of a certain disease might be varied depending on the types of diseases. It is important to note that although a double blocker is much more effective than a single blocker in many disease models as shown in cases of retinopathy and psoriasis, the efficacy of the double blocker can sometimes be different for other types of diseases that are caused by other unknown factors.Valpha, the chimeric double decoy receptor that binds to both VEGF-A and TNF-α and blo"
https://openalex.org/W2041353187,"Host cell invasion by the facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes requires the invasion protein InlB in many cell types. InlB consists of an N-terminal internalin domain that binds the host cell receptor tyrosine kinase Met and C-terminal GW domains that bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Met binding and activation is required for host cell invasion, while the interaction between GW domains and GAGs enhances this effect. Soluble InlB elicits the same cellular phenotypes as the natural Met ligand hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), e.g. cell scatter. So far, little is known about the central part of InlB, the B-repeat. Here we present a structural and functional characterization of the InlB B-repeat. The crystal structure reveals a variation of the β-grasp fold that is most similar to small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs). However, structural similarity also suggests a potential evolutionary relation to bacterial mucin-binding proteins. The B-repeat defines the prototype structure of a hitherto uncharacterized domain present in over a thousand bacterial proteins. Generally, this domain probably acts as a spacer or a receptor-binding domain in extracellular multi-domain proteins. In cellular assays the B-repeat acts synergistically with the internalin domain conferring to it the ability to stimulate cell motility. Thus, the B-repeat probably binds a further host cell receptor and thereby enhances signaling downstream of Met."

A screen of protein kinases that bind to NHE1 revealed that B-Raf bound to the cytosolic regulatory tail of NHE1. Immunoprecipitation of NHE1 from HeLa and HEK cells confirmed the association of B-Raf with NHE1 in vivo. The expressed and purified C-terminal 182 amino acids of the NHE1 protein were also shown to associate with B-Raf protein in vitro. Because treatment with the kinase inhibitor sorafenib decreased NHE1 activity in HeLa and HEK cells, we examined the role of B-Raf in regulating NHE1 in malignant melanoma cells. Melanoma cells with the B-RafV600E mutation demonstrated increased resting intracellular pH that was dependent on elevated NHE1 activity. NHE1 activity after an acute acid load was also elevated in these cell lines. Moreover, inhibition of B-Raf activity by either sorafenib, PLX4720, or siRNA reduction of B-Raf levels abolished ERK phosphorylation and decreased NHE1 activity.

https://openalex.org/W1999764701,"The covalent attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) to various intracellular proteins plays important roles in altering the function, localization, processing, and degradation of the modified target. A minimal ubiquitylation pathway uses a three-enzyme cascade (E1, E2, and E3) to activate Ub and select target proteins for modification. Although diverse E3 families provide much of the target specificity, several factors have emerged recently that coordinate the subcellular localization of the ubiquitylation machinery. Here, we show that the family of membrane-anchored ubiquitin-fold (MUB) proteins recruits and docks specific E2s to the plasma membrane. Protein interaction screens with Arabidopsis MUBs revealed that interacting E2s are limited to a well defined subgroup that is phylogenetically related to human UbcH5 and yeast Ubc4/5 families. MUBs appear to interact noncovalently with an E2 surface opposite the active site that forms a covalent linkage with Ub. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation demonstrated that MUBs bind simultaneously to the plasma membrane via a prenyl tail and to the E2 in planta. These findings suggest that MUBs contribute subcellular specificity to ubiquitylation by docking the conjugation machinery to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2073238770,"γ-Aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) in the spinal cord are evolving as an important target for drug development against pain. Purinergic P2X(2) receptors (P2X(2)Rs) are also expressed in spinal cord neurons and are known to cross-talk with GABA(A)Rs. Here, we investigated a possible ""dynamic"" interaction between GABA(A)Rs and P2X(2)Rs using co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells along with co-localization and single particle tracking studies in spinal cord neurons. Our results suggest that a significant proportion of P2X(2)Rs forms a transient complex with GABA(A)Rs inside the cell, thus stabilizing these receptors and using them for co-trafficking to the cell surface, where P2X(2)Rs and GABA(A)Rs are primarily located extra-synaptically. Furthermore, agonist-induced activation of P2X(2)Rs results in a Ca(2+)-dependent as well as an apparently Ca(2+)-independent increase in the mobility and an enhanced degradation of GABA(A)Rs, whereas P2X(2)Rs are stabilized and form larger clusters. Antagonist-induced blocking of P2XRs results in co-stabilization of this receptor complex at the cell surface. These results suggest a novel mechanism where association of P2X(2)Rs and GABA(A)Rs could be used for specific targeting to neuronal membranes, thus providing an extrasynaptic receptor reserve that could regulate the excitability of neurons. We further conclude that blocking the excitatory activity of excessively released ATP under diseased state by P2XR antagonists could simultaneously enhance synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA(A)Rs."
https://openalex.org/W2086082022,"D-aspartate (D-Asp) is found in specific neurons, transported to neuronal terminals and released in a stimulation-dependent manner. Because D-Asp formation is not well understood, determining its function has proved challenging. Significant levels of D-Asp are present in the cerebral ganglion of the F- and C-clusters of the invertebrate Aplysia californica, and D-Asp appears to be involved in cell-cell communication in this system. Here, we describe a novel protein, DAR1, from A. californica that can convert aspartate and serine to their other chiral form in a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent manner. DAR1 has a predicted length of 325 amino acids and is 55% identical to the bivalve aspartate racemase, EC 5.1.1.13, and 41% identical to the mammalian serine racemase, EC 5.1.1.18. However, it is only 14% identical to the recently reported mammalian aspartate racemase, DR, which is closely related to glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, EC 2.6.1.1. Using whole-mount immunohistochemistry staining of the A. californica central nervous system, we localized DAR1-like immunoreactivity to the medial region of the cerebral ganglion where the F- and C-clusters are situated. The biochemical and functional similarities between DAR1 and other animal serine and aspartate racemases make it valuable for examining PLP-dependent racemases, promising to increase our knowledge of enzyme regulation and ultimately, D-serine and D-Asp signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2033785292,"R7BP (RGS7 family-binding protein) has been proposed to function in neurons as a palmitoylation-regulated protein that shuttles heterodimeric, G(i/o)α-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complexes composed of Gβ5 and RGS7 (R7) isoforms between the plasma membrane and nucleus. To test this hypothesis we studied R7BP palmitoylation and localization in neuronal cells. We report that R7BP undergoes dynamic, signal-regulated palmitate turnover; the palmitoyltransferase DHHC2 mediates de novo and turnover palmitoylation of R7BP; DHHC2 silencing redistributes R7BP from the plasma membrane to the nucleus; and G(i/o) signaling inhibits R7BP depalmitoylation whereas G(i/o) inactivation induces nuclear accumulation of R7BP. In concert with previous evidence, our findings suggest that agonist-induced changes in palmitoylation state facilitate GAP action by (i) promoting Giα depalmitoylation to create optimal GAP substrates, and (ii) inhibiting R7BP depalmitoylation to stabilize membrane association of R7-Gβ5 GAP complexes. Regulated palmitate turnover may also enable R7BP-bound GAPs to shuttle between sites of low and high G(i/o) activity or the plasma membrane and nucleus, potentially providing spatio-temporal control of signaling by G(i/o)-coupled receptors."

RDH10 shares little similarity with the retinol/sterol dehydrogenases (abbreviated here as RSDHs) described above and belongs to a different branch of the SDR phylogenetic tree.

However, their relative roles in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid and regulation of gene expression are not known. In part, this is due to technical difficulties associated with analyzing functions of enzymes that are expressed at very low levels in human cell lines and tissues and their generally low enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the use of mouse models has been limited by the redundancy of RoDH-like SDR homologs in mice and the lack of orthologs for some of the human genes (19Belyaeva O.V. Kedishvili N.Y. Genomics. 2006; 88: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of the ex vivo human organotypic skin culture to examine the contribution of human SDRs to retinoic acid biosynthesis and their impact on gene expression. Human organotypic skin culture is very similar to human skin in its morphology and metabolism because human foreskin keratinocytes are grown at the liquid-air interface, a system that recreates fully differentiated squamous epithelium (28Banerjee N.S. Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Davy C. Doorbar J. Human Papillomaviruses: Methods and Protocols, Methods in Molecular Medicine. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 187-202Google Scholar). Keratinocytes placed on top of the collagen bed receive moisture and nutrients through the support matrix, growing upwards and forming a “raft” culture. The keratinocytes in this raft culture proliferate, stratify, differentiate, and form layers just like normal skin. Importantly, this model recreates the complex process of epidermal differentiation that involves the temporal and spatial regulation of a large number of key molecules (29Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar); gene expression pattern in raft cultures is very similar to that seen in whole foreskin (30Wilson J.L. Dollard S.C. Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 471-483PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bernard F.X. Pedretti N. Rosdy M. Deguercy A. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 11: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The genetic make-up of skin raft culture can be manipulated using retrovirus-mediated gene expression. This aspect of skin raft culture model was utilized in the present study to investigate the individual contribution of the four human SDR enzymes to the biosynthesis of retinoic acid and regulation of gene expression during the growth and differentiation of human epidermis. The results of this study reveal important differences in the physiological roles of the four human SDRs. The cDNAs encoding human RDH10, RoDH4, RL-HSD, and RDHL were PCR-amplified from clones described previously using the primers containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Sequences of primers are as follows: RDH10, 5′-GTG GAT CCA TGA ACA TCG TGG TGG AGT TCT TCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAG AAT TCA GAT TCT TAG ATT CCA TTT TTT GCT TCA T-3′ (reverse); RL-HSD, 5′-ATC GGA TCC ATG TGG CTC TAC CTG GCA GCC T-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATC GAA TTC TTA GAC TGC CTG GGC TGG TTT GG-3′ (reverse); RDHL, 5′-ATC GGA TCC ATG CTC TTT TGG GTG CTA GGC CT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATC GAA TTC TCA CAC TGC CTT GGG ATT AGC C-3′ (reverse); and RoDH4, 5′-ATC GGA TCC ATG TGG CTC TAC CTG GCG GTT TTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATC GAA TTC TCA TAG AGC CTT GGC CGG GCT TG-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI endonucleases and cloned into the corresponding sites of Moloney murine leukemia retroviral vector pBabe puro under the control of the retroviral long terminal repeat promoter. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Retroviral vectors were introduced into an ecotropic cell line Bosc23 by electroporation. Culture media from electroporated cells containing ecotropic retroviruses were used to infect GP+envAM12 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA), an NIH3T3-derived amphotropic packaging cell line. Twenty-four hours after infection, the cells were placed into selection medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin for 6 days. The resistant cells were allowed to reach confluence to obtain high titer retroviruses. The retrovirus-containing media from the producer cells was used to infect primary human keratinocytes (PHKs) (32Cheng S. Schmidt-Grimminger D.C. Murant T. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2335-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Neonatal foreskins were obtained from the Newborn Nursery of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital in compliance with University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board regulations. Epidermal raft cultures were prepared as described previously (32Cheng S. Schmidt-Grimminger D.C. Murant T. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2335-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, PHKs were isolated from freshly collected neonatal foreskins and cultured in DermaLife calcium-free medium (Lifeline Cell Technology, Walkersville, MD). Freshly collected retrovirus-containing media from producer cells were used to infect PHKs. Infected PHKs were selected with 1.5 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days and then cultured in DermaLife calcium-free medium until confluency. Retrovirus-transduced PHKs (4 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded onto a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen with embedded Swiss 3T3 J2 fibroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. Louise T. Chow, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama, Birmingham). After 3 days, skin equivalents were lifted onto stainless steel grids and cultured at the medium-air interface using raft culture medium prepared from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F12 medium, and bovine fetal serum, which was supplemented with cholera toxin, insulin, apo-transferrin, hydrocortisone-21, and human epidermal growth factor as described previously (32Cheng S. Schmidt-Grimminger D.C. Murant T. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2335-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The raft cultures were allowed to stratify and differentiate for 10–11 days, whereupon they were harvested for analysis. Twelve hours before harvest, the medium was supplemented with BrdU (50 μg/ml) to mark cells in S phase. The rafts were harvested, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Alternatively, epithelial tissues were separated manually from the collagen bed and used for protein extraction. Paraffin-embedded skin rafts were cut into 5-μm sections, mounted on Superfrost/Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and then deparaffinized and rehydrated by a series of washes in containers with decreasing concentrations of ethanol (95, 85, 70, 50, and 30%). For H&E staining, the sections were incubated with Weigert's hematoxylin (Poly Scientific, Bay Shore, NY), dehydrated through graded ethanol, restained with eosin (Fisher Scientific), and mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific). For immunohistochemical staining, the sections were pretreated with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95 °C for 10 min to unmask antigens, followed by incubation in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were then washed in PBS (pH 7.2) and incubated with primary antibodies as follows: a 1:100 dilution of BrdU antibodies (Invitrogen); and a 1:100 dilution of filaggrin antibodies (Leica Microsytems, Inc. Bannockburn, IL). After incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, samples were rinsed with PBS and reincubated with a 1:50 dilution of biotinylated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, anti-mouse immunoglobulins) from the SuperSensitive Link-Label-IHC detection kit manufactured by Biogenex (San Ramon, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS several times, the sections were incubated for 30 min with a 1:50 dilution of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase followed by incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride from Turbbo DAB kit (Innovex Biosciences, Richmond, CA) as the chromogenic substrate. Sections were counterstained with Weigert's hematoxylin (Poly Scientific), dehydrated through graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted with Permount (Fisher Scientific). All sections were analyzed at a 20× magnification using AxioImager A2 microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera and AxioVision image capture software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The epidermis from raft cultures was peeled off collagen beds and homogenized on ice in PBS with 20% glycerol containing a mixture of protease inhibitors: aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μg/ml). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were quantified using Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were resolved by electrophoresis in 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for subsequent probing with polyclonal antibodies against RoDH4 (1:5000 dilution) (33Gough W.H.

Gel loading was determined by reprobing with HRP-conjugated monoclonal β-actin antibody (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich). Organotypic cultures of PHKs expressing RDH10, RoDH4, RL-HSD, and RDHL were prepared essentially as described above with minor modifications. Retrovirus-transduced PHKs (4 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded onto Costar Transwells (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA), which were placed into 24-well plates. At confluency, transwells containing PHKs were transferred onto dermal equivalents, and skin rafts were cultured as described above. For analysis of retinoid metabolism, culture medium was supplemented with 2 μm all-trans-retinol under reduced light 24 h before harvest. Rafts were peeled off transwells and homogenized in PBS on ice. Culture media were collected separately. All manipulations were done under reduced light. Retinoids were extracted into hexane and separated by reversed phase HPLC using a Waters Alliance separation module and 2996 Photodiode array detector (35Molotkov A. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Duester G. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Chromatographic peaks were identified by comparing retention times and spectra against retinoid standards and quantified as described previously (36Belyaeva O.V. Korkina O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Kim T. Nelson P.S. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7035-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Total retinoids were normalized by tissue weight and protein amount. For steroid activity assays, commercially available radiolabeled steroids (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; ∼40–60 Ci/mmol each) were diluted with cold steroids (Steraloids, Inc. Newport, RI) dissolved in Me2SO. For analysis of activities in raft cultures, steroid stock solutions were added to skin raft culture medium containing fetal bovine serum. Steroid reference standards were generated by incubating Sf9 microsomes expressing RL-HSD with androsterone (ADT) or allopregnanolone (ALLO) in phosphate buffer (90 mm KH2PO4, 40 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing fatty acid-free BSA equimolar to steroids as described previously (34Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After a 24-h incubation, media and cells were collected separately as described above and extracted with 7 volumes of dichloromethane. The organic layer was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and dissolved in 50 μl of fresh dichloromethane. Steroids were separated by development in toluene:acetone (4:1) on silica gel TLC plates (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). TLC plates containing 3H-labeled steroids were exposed to a PhosphorImager tritium screen (GE Healthcare) overnight, and the intensity of the bands was calculated using ImageQuant program (version 5.0). Products of each reaction were identified by comparison to reference steroids (34Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by gradient reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The gradient was generated with a Shimadzu Prominence Ultra Fast Liquid Chromatography system consisting of a vacuum degasser, binary pump, and a temperature-controlled autosampler. The injection volume was 80 μl, and the samples were maintained in the autosampler at 4 °C. The separation was performed on a Develosil RP Aqueous 2.00 mm × 150 mm (5 μ) column with a 2.00 mm × 30 mm guard column. Mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water; mobile phase B was acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. The gradient was as follows: 0–3 min, 70% B; 4–6 min, 95% B; and 6.5–10 min, 70% B. The flow rate was 0.75 ml/min. Data were acquired with an Applied Biosystems API-4000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization operating in positive ion mode. The mass spectrometer and HPLC were controlled with Analyst (version 1.4.2) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The mass transitions used to monitor all-trans-retinoic acid were m/z 301 (M + H)+ to the m/z 123, 105, and 81 fragments. The dwell time was 40 ms for all mass transitions. The atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-optimized conditions include the following: curtain gas, 10; collision gas, 12; nebulizer gas, 70; nebulizer current, 4; and source temperature, 350. All gases were nitrogen. RNA from rafts was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was purified using a MiniPrep DNA purification kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR was performed in a LightCycler® 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science) using LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche Applied Science) with 0.5 μm primers and 2.5–25 ng of purified cDNA per reaction. Sequences of the primers are available by request. Levels of transcripts were determined using relative quantification method (37Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). Three empty vector-transduced and three SDR-expressing rafts were included in each q-PCR experiment. To evaluate the significance of differences in expression levels of each transcript between control and SDR-expressing rafts, an unpaired t test was performed, and the two-tailed p value was determined using GraphPad InStat (version 3.00; GraphPad Software, San Diego California). Previous studies have indicated that the retinoid-active SDRs are expressed naturally in human skin (25Markova N.G. Pinkas-Sarafova A. Karaman-Jurukovska N. Jurukovski V. Simon M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Jurukovski V. Markova N.G. Karaman-Jurukovska N. Randolph R.K. Su J. Napoli J.L. Simon M. Mol. Genet.

Commun. 2003; 303: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that skin organotypic culture is a physiologically relevant model for analyzing functions of these enzymes. We have confirmed the presence of RoDH4, RDHL, and RDH10 transcripts in human organotypic raft cultures by RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. 1). However, the protein levels of most of these enzymes were below detection limit by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Therefore, we examined their functions by increasing the levels of individual proteins through retrovirus-mediated ectopic expression of the corresponding cDNAs. PHKs from neonatal foreskin infected with retroviruses were plated on a collagen-fibroblast matrix and then lifted to the air-liquid interface to generate stratified and differentiated epithelium. To confirm the ectopic expression of the SDRs, epidermis was separated manually from collagen beds and processed for immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1, protein levels of RDH10, RoDH4, and RL-HSD, which were below detection limit by available antisera in skin rafts infected with empty virus (Fig. 1, A–C), increased significantly following transduction with the corresponding recombinant retroviruses. The levels of RDHL protein, which was visible in mock-transduced rafts, increased further in transgenic skin infected with RDHL-expressing retrovirus (Fig. 1D). This analysis confirmed successful expression of the SDR proteins in transgenic skin. As PHKs proliferated and formed stratified epithelium, significant differences were noted in the appearance of rafts expressing RDH10 compared with other rafts. RDH10 rafts appeared to be softer and more transparent than mock-transduced rafts or rafts expressing RoDH4, RL-HSD, or RDHL. To evaluate the morphology of transgenic epidermis, rafts were sectioned and stained with H&E. This analysis revealed striking differences in the histology of RDH10 rafts compared with other rafts (Fig. 2). RoDH4, RL-HSD, RDHL, and mock-transduced rafts had a well developed histological appearance with clearly visible spinous, granular, and cornified layers. In contrast, the granular layer in RDH10 rafts was developed poorly, and the cornified layer was much thinner than in control cultures or completely absent. Extending the time of RDH10 rafts in culture from 11 to 16 days did not produce a more differentiated epidermis (data not shown), indicating that the differentiation was not simply delayed but was profoundly impaired. Immunohistochemical staining for BrdU incorporation revealed increased proliferation of basal cells in RDH10 rafts (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the expression of keratinocyte differentiation marker filaggrin, which was detected in a continuous band in the granular layer of RSDH rafts and mock-transduced rafts, was severely reduced or completely absent in RDH10 rafts (Fig. 2), indicating an overall inhibition of keratinocyte differentiation and stratification/cornification of the epidermis. Retinoic acid is known to induce proliferation of basal keratinocytes and to inhibit their differentiation (2Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

We identified novel spliced variants of K(Ca)3.1 (human (h) K(Ca)3.1b) from the human thymus, which were lacking the N-terminal domains of the original hK(Ca)3.1a as a result of alternative splicing events. hK(Ca)3.1b was significantly expressed in human lymphoid tissues. Western blot analysis showed that hK(Ca)3.1a proteins were mainly expressed in the plasma membrane fraction, whereas hK(Ca)3.1b was in the cytoplasmic fraction. We also identified a similar N terminus lacking K(Ca)3.1 variants from mice and rat lymphoid tissues (mK(Ca)3.1b and rK(Ca)3.1b). In the HEK293 heterologous expression system, the cellular distribution of cyan fluorescent protein-tagged hK(Ca)3.1a and/or YFP-tagged hK(Ca)3.1b isoforms showed that hK(Ca)3.1b suppressed the localization of hK(Ca)3.1a to the plasma membrane. In the Xenopus oocyte translation system, co-expression of hK(Ca)3.1b with hK(Ca)3.1a suppressed IK(Ca) channel activity of hK(Ca)3.1a in a dominant-negative manner. In addition, this study indicated that up-regulation of mK(Ca)3.1b in mouse thymocytes differentiated CD4(+)CD8(+) phenotype thymocytes into CD4(-)CD8(-) ones and suppressed concanavalin-A-stimulated thymocyte growth by down-regulation of mIL-2 transcripts. Anti-proliferative effects and down-regulation of mIL-2 transcripts were also observed in mK(Ca)3.1b-overexpressing mouse thymocytes. These suggest that the N-terminal domain of K(Ca)3.1 is critical for channel trafficking to the plasma membrane and that the fine-tuning of IK(Ca) channel activity modulated through alternative splicing events may be related to the control in physiological and pathophysiological conditions in T-lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1989089149,"Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential co-factor for the nitric-oxide (NO) synthases, and in its absence these enzymes produce superoxide (O2̇̄) rather than NO. The rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 production is guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH-1). Because endogenously produced NO affects T cell function, we sought to determine whether antigen stimulation affected T cell GTPCH-1 expression and ultimately BH4 levels. Resting T cells had minimal expression of inducible NOS (NOS2), endothelial NOS (NOS3), and GTPCH-1 protein and nearly undetectable levels of BH4. Anti-CD3 stimulation of T cells robustly stimulated the coordinated expression of NOS2, NOS3, and GTPCH-1 and markedly increased both GTPCH-1 activity and T cell BH4 levels. The newly expressed GTPCH-1 was phosphorylated on serine 72 and pharmacological inhibition of casein kinase II reduced GTPCH-1 phosphorylation and blunted the increase in T cell BH4. Inhibition of GTPCH-1 with diaminohydroxypyrimidine (1 mmol/liter) prevented T cell BH4 accumulation, reduced NO production, and increased T cell O2̇̄ production, due to both NOS2 and NOS3 uncoupling. GTPCH-1 inhibition also promoted TH2 polarization in memory CD4 cells.

Endogenously produced NO can either induce or suppress T regulatory cells depending on the nature of the external stimulus (6Niedbala W. Cai B. Liu H. Pitman N. Chang L. Liew F.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad.

All NOS enzymes require tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a co-factor. During NOS catalysis, electrons are transferred from the flavin-containing reductase domain to a heme group in the oxygenase domain. This reduces the heme iron to a ferrous state. The ferrous heme readily binds oxygen, forming a ferrous-dioxy (FeII-O2) intermediate. BH4, which is also bound in the oxygenase domain, donates an electron that causes scission of FeII-O2 to an iron-oxy species (8Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J.

In the absence of BH4, the NOS enzymes produce superoxide (O2̇̄) and other reactive oxygen species rather than NO. This condition is referred to as NOS uncoupling (13Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P.

Uncoupling of NOS3 contributes to the vascular pathology associated with common diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis (16Landmesser U. Dikalov S. Price S.R. McCann L. Fukai T.

BH4 is produced by a complex enzymatic pathway involving the serial actions of GTP cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH-1), pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase, and sepiapterin reductase (18Thöny B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The first of these enzymes, GTPCH-1, converts guanosine 5′-triphosphate to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate and is most often rate-limiting. This enzyme exists as a homodecamer, and its activity is regulated in a negative feedback fashion by levels of BH4, which promotes binding of GTPCH-1 with its inhibitor protein (GFRP) (19Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20102-20108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, when cellular BH4 levels are sufficient, GFRP binds to and inhibits GTPCH-1 function in a negative feedback fashion. Recently, we found that phosphorylation of human GTPCH-1 at serine 81 reduces its binding to GFRP and thus prevents inhibition by this negative feedback process (20Li L. Rezvan A. Salerno J.C. Husain A. Kwon K. Jo H. Harrison D.G. Chen W. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Given the importance of GTPCH-1 and BH4 in cellular NO production and the evolving understanding of NO in T cell function, the present study was performed to understand how T cell levels of BH4 and T cell GTPCH-1 activity are regulated. Our studies show that resting T cells have virtually no NOS, GTPCH-1, or BH4. Ligation of the T cell receptor leads to expression of GTPCH-1 and both NOS2 and NOS3. We further examined the importance of BH4 production in modulating T cell NO and O2̇̄ production and CD4+ cytokine production. Total splenocytes were obtained from mouse spleens, and CD3+ T cells were isolated using the Pan T cell isolation kit (Milentyl Biotec, catalog no. 130-090-861). Respective T cell subtypes were isolated from CD3+ cells using CD4, CD8, and CD4+ CD62L T cell isolation kits obtained from Milentyl Biotec (catalog numbers 130-090-860, 130-090-859, and 130-049-701, respectively). Memory CD4+, CD62L CD44high cells were isolated using a kit from R&D Systems (catalog number MAGM206). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc., catalog number 15-041-CV) supplemented with 1% (v/v) l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For T cell activation, cells were cultured for 48 h on 96-well plates coated with anti-CD3 antibody from BD Biosciences (catalog number 354720) in the above medium containing 20 units/ml IL-2. In some experiments, dasatinib (50 nmol/liter; Selleck Chemicals) was added to the tissue culture. In experiments involving prolonged T cell culture, medium without IL-2 was substituted after 48 h. C57BL/6, OT-II, NOS2−/−, and NOS3−/− mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. They were studied at 3 months of age. Western blotting was performed as described previously (20Li L. Rezvan A.

Antibodies for NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3 were from BD Biosciences (catalog numbers 610310, 610332, and 610298, respectively) and were used at a 1:3000 dilution. Polyclonal antibodies to GTPCH-1 amino acids 1–20 and a mouse serine 72 phosphoantibody were raised in rabbits and used at dilutions of 1:2000 and 1:1000, respectively. A secondary anti-rabbit antibody from Bio-Rad was employed at a dilution of 1:5000. Quantitative real-time PCRs were employed to quantify mRNA levels of GFRP using commercially available Taqman primers and an Applied Biosystems 7500 PCR system. Total biopterin, BH4, and oxidized forms of BH4 were quantified using differential oxidation in acid and alkaline conditions followed by HPLC as described previously (20Li L. Rezvan A. Salerno J.C.

Hatakeyama K. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). O2̇̄ was detected by monitoring the oxidation of dihydroethidium to the specific product 2-hydroxyethidium as described previously (22Dikalov S. Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. Hypertension. 2007; 49: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). NO was detected using the spin trap Fe[DETC]2 and electron spin resonance as described previously (23Cai H. Dikalov S. Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. Sreejayan N. Ren J. Methods in Molecular Medicine. Humana Press, New York, NY2005: 293-314Google Scholar). T cells were isolated from mouse spleen and cultured on anti-CD3 plates with or without the GTPCH-1-specific inhibitor 2,4 diamino-6-hydroxypyrimadine (DAHP) at a final concentration of 1 mmol/liter for 7 days. Following this, levels of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and TNF-α in the media were measured using cytokine bead array (catalog number 551287; BD Biosciences). In some experiments, either the NO donor DETA-NO (1 μmol/liter; catalog number 82120, Cayman Chemical) or PEG-SOD (200 units/ml; catalog number S9549, Sigma) were added to the media. Media and drugs were changed every 48 h. Data in this paper are presented as means ± S.E. When comparing two or three variables, two-tailed unpaired t tests were employed with a Bonferroni correction when appropriate. When comparing multiple variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed using a Dunnett's post hoc, allowing comparison to control values. Two-way ANOVA was also employed when comparing the effect of an intervention on different cells. In initial experiments, we found that resting T cells express minimal levels of either NOS2 or NOS3 protein; however, stimulation with anti-CD3 for 48 h robustly stimulated expression of both of these (Fig. 1, A and B). NOS1 was not detectable in either resting or stimulated T cells as determined by Western blotting and real-time PCR (data not shown). Because the NOS enzymes require BH4 as an essential co-factor for production of NO, we also examined levels of BH4 in resting and stimulated T cells. Levels of BH4 and its oxidized products were nearly undetectable in resting T cells, but were markedly increased by exposure to anti-CD3-coated plates for 48 h (Fig. 1C). To determine whether this was specific for either CD4 or CD8 T cells, we isolated subsets of these cells using negative selection and exposed these cells to anti-CD3. Pterin synthesis was stimulated to a roughly equal extent in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (Fig. 1D). The ratio of oxidized to reduced BH4 was greater in CD8+ compared with CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1E). These data show that activation of murine T cells leads to a striking induction of both NOS enzymes and BH4 production in a coordinated fashion. The enzyme GTPCH-1 plays a critical role as the rate-limiting step in BH4 biosynthesis. In keeping with the marked increase in BH4 caused by T cell receptor ligation, we also found that this stimulus markedly increased GTPCH-1 protein levels (Fig. 2, A and B). Likewise, GTPCH-1 activity was essentially undetectable in resting T cells, but was markedly increased upon exposure of cells to anti-CD3 for 48 h (Fig. 2C). T cell activation was not associated with a change in mRNA levels of GFRP (Fig. 2D). In other cells, cytokines induce expression of GTPCH-1 (24Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in this protein and T cell levels of BH4 could have been due to IL-2, which was used in culture of the T cells, rather than T cell receptor ligation per se. We found, however, that GTPCH-1 expression was increased by anti-CD3 even when IL-2 was excluded from the media, indicating that this cytokine does not significantly alter GTPCH-1 expression (data not shown). An important downstream signaling event of T cell receptor ligation is activation of the tyrosine kinase Lck, which is inhibited by dasatinib (25Lee K.C. Ouwehand I. Giannini A.L. Thomas N.S. Dibb N.J. Bijlmakers M.J. Leukemia. 2010; 24: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Addition of dasatinib during exposure to anti-CD3 completely abrogated the increase in GTPCH-1 protein (Fig. 3, A and B). Previously, we found that human endothelial GTPCH-1 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II at serine 81 in response to mechanical shear stress and that this increases its activity by 30-fold (20Li L. Rezvan A. Salerno J.C. Husain A. Kwon K. Jo H. Harrison D.G. Chen W. Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the newly synthesized GTPCH-1 in T cells was also phosphorylated at serine 72 (the mouse equivalent of human serine 81; Fig. 2C). In keeping with prior findings in human endothelial cells, the casein kinase II inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) (26Sarno S. Reddy H. Meggio F. Ruzzene M. Davies S.P. Donella-Deana A. Shugar D. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), reduced GTPCH-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C) and decreased GTPCH-1 activity (Fig. 3D). We next sought to determine whether GTPCH-1 activation is necessary for function of NOS within T cells. To accomplish this, we exposed cells to anti-CD3 in the presence and absence of the GTPCH-1 inhibitor DAHP (1 mmol/liter) (27Gál E.M. Nelson J.M. Sherman A.D. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 69-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As evident in Fig. 4A, DAHP prevented the increase in both reduced and oxidized BH4 in T cells exposed to anti-CD3. In keeping with a critical role of BH4 in regulating NO production, exposure of T cells to anti-CD3 stimulated NO production as detected by the spin trap Fe[DETC]2 and electron spin resonance, and this increase was abolished by concomitant treatment of cells with DAHP (Fig. 4B). In the absence of BH4, the NOS enzymes produce O2̇̄ rather than NO (14Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wever R.M. van Dam T. van Rijn H.J. de Groot F. Rabelink T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether this was true in T cells and to examine the relative contributions of NOS2 and NOS3 to this process. We therefore examined production of O2̇̄ by T cells isolated from spleens of wild-type, NOS2−/−, and NOS3−/− mice. At base line, these produced similar levels of O2̇̄ (Fig. 4C). Exposure of wild-type T cells to DAHP increased T cell O2̇̄ production by almost 2-fold (Fig. 4C). Both NOS2 and NOS3 seemed to be sources of this radical because DAHP did not increase O2̇̄ in cells lacking these compared with the wild-type cells. To examine further a role of NOS2, we treated NOS3-deficient cells with the specific NOS2 inhibitor 1400W, which dissociates the heme from NOS2 and prevents the ability of this enzyme to produce O2̇̄ (28Zhu Y. Nikolic D. Van Breemen R.B. Silverman R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 858-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Miller A.A. Megson I.L. Gray G.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Addition of 1400W decreased NOS3−/− cell production of O2̇̄ both at base line and following DAHP treatment. Thus, when murine T cells are stimulated by anti-CD3, the increase in BH4 is essential to allow adequate function of the newly synthesized NOS isoforms. Both O2̇̄ and NO have been reported to affect T cell polarization (30Jackson S.H. Devadas S. Kwon J. Pinto L.A. Williams M.S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 31King M.R. Ismail A.S. Davis L.S. Karp D.R. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2765-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Feuerer M. Eulenburg K. Loddenkemper C. Hamann A. Huehn J. J.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16186-16191Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that uncoupling of the NOS enzymes could modulate T cell cytokine production. To examine this, we isolated memory murine CD4+ T cells and exposed them to anti-CD3-coated plates for 7 days in the absence and presence of DAHP, to prevent BH4 synthesis. Incubation of T cells with DAHP decreased IFN-γ production by one-half and doubled IL-4 production (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, DAHP co-incubation had no effect on either IL-5 or TNF-α production (Fig. 5, C and D). These changes in IL-4 and IFN-γ production could have been due to an increased O2̇̄ or decreased NO production. To determine which of these might have contributed, we added either PEG-SOD (200 units/ml) or the NO donor DETA-NO (1 μmol/liter) every 48 h throughout the incubation. Addition of the NO donor had no effect on production of any of the cytokines studied; however, PEG-SOD restored production of IFN-γ and IL-4 to levels observed in the absence of DAHP (Fig. 5, A and B). PEG-SOD also decreased IL-5 production (Fig. 5C). These studies indicate that NOS uncoupling leads to polarization of T cells toward a TH2 phenotype and that this is largely due to an increase in cellular O2̇̄ production. To determine whether T cell activation in vivo also stimulates levels of BH4, we performed additional studies in OT-II mice. These animals are transgenic for a T cell receptor that induces production of CD4+-activated T cells when immunized using the ovalbumin peptide 323–339 (34Barnden M.J. Allison J. Heath W.R. Carbone F.R. Immunol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 76: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). OT-II mice were injected intraperitoneally with this peptide (0.5 μg/μl) or vehicle (Al(OH)3, 2.5 μg/μl) on two occasions 1 week apart. Five days following the final ovalbumin injection, CD62L (effector) T cells were isolated and pterin levels measured. As evident in Fig. 6, CD4 effector T cells from OT-II mice immunized with ovalbumin peptide contained ∼4-fold more total pterins and BH4 than did cells from animals injected with the Al(OH)3 vehicle. These findings indicate that T cell activation in vivo stimulates BH4 synthesis in these cells. In the current study, we show that T cell receptor ligation causes a coordinated increase in both NOS2 and NOS3 while also markedly stimulating expression of the rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 production, GTPCH-1. This concomitant stimulation of these three enzymes allows T cell production of NO and plays an important role in modulating T cell function. The increase in BH4 occurs in both CD4 and CD8 cells and in the former, regulates cytokine production, in large part by preventing O2̇̄ production from the NOSs. We further show that T cell activation in vivo stimulates T cell BH4 levels. These studies have identified a previously unknown role of BH4 in modulating T cell function upon activation. We found that the newly expressed GTPCH-1 is phosphorylated on serine 72. In prior studies, we found that the mechanical force of shear stress stimulates GTPCH-1 phosphorylation by casein kinase IIα′. As in the case with shear in the endothelium, the casein kinase II inhibitor TBB reduces phosphorylation of the T cell GTPCH-1, indicating a role of casein kinase II in T cells. Thus, the ultimate effects of T cell receptor ligation and laminar shear in the endothelium on GTPCH-1 phosphorylation and activity are quite similar. In both cell types, resting BH4 and GTPCH-1 activity are very low, but are stimulated by more than 20-fold by the respective stimuli of T cell receptor ligation and endothelial laminar shear stress. It is of interest that both stimuli affect the actin cytoskeleton in the respective cell types and share similar signaling mechanisms, including activation of tyrosine kinases, G proteins, and MAP kinases (35Collins M. Bartelt R.R. Houtman J.C. Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 1665-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is induced rapidly upon exposure to shear stress in a redox-sensitive fashion (37Tai L.K. Okuda M. Abe J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1790-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Likewise, Pyk2 is induced by T cell receptor ligation and promotes production of TH2 cytokines in vivo (38Collins M. Tremblay M. Chapman N. Curtiss M. Rothman P.B. Houtman J.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2010; 87: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Duan Y. Learoyd J. Meliton A.Y. Clay B.S. Leff A.R. Zhu X. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2010; 42: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The precise roles of these signaling pathways leading to GTPCH-1 activation remain undefined. Of interest, the tyrosine kinase Lck is upstream of Pyk2 activation in T cells (35Collins M. Bartelt R.R. Houtman J.C. Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 1665-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we found that the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib, which potently inhibits Lck (25Lee K.C. Ouwehand I. Giannini A.L. Thomas N.S. Dibb N.J. Bijlmakers M.J. Leukemia. 2010; 24: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), completely prevented the increase in GTPCH-1 in response to anti-CD3 exposure. In the present study, we found that prevention of BH4 synthesis in stimulated cells further increased T cell O2̇̄ production and prevented an increase in NO production (Fig. 4), compatible with uncoupling of NOS within these cells. In memory CD4+ cells, this led to an increase in the TH2 cytokine IL-4 and a decrease in the TH1 cytokine IFN-γ. These perturbations of cytokine production were prevented by co-treatment of cells with PEG-SOD, suggesting that O2̇̄ or a product of O2̇̄ such as the peroxynitrite anion contribute to TH2 polarization of T cells. These findings are in accord with a prior study from Jackson et al., who showed that stimulation of T cell blasts with anti-CD3 caused production of reactive oxygen species as detected by the fluorescent dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate (30Jackson S.H. Devadas S. Kwon J. Pinto L.A. Williams M.S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In cells from mice lacking the NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox, these investigators showed that T cell receptor ligation augmented IFN-γ and diminished production of IL-4 and IL-5, suggesting that an absence of reactive oxygen species from this source promoted TH1 polarization. More recently, King et al. showed that induction of intracellular O2̇̄ by a redox cycling agent promoted TH2 polarization of human T cells (31King M.R. Ismail A.S. Davis L.S. Karp D.R. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2765-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These data are in accord with our present study supporting a role of O2̇̄ in suppressing IFN-γ and stimulating IL-4 production. It is conceivable that uncoupled NOS could have affected cytokine production by also reducing T cell levels of NO. Ibiza et al. have shown that upon T cell receptor ligation with an antigen-presenting cell, NOS3 moves with the Golgi apparatus to the region of the immunological synapse (3Ibiza S. Víctor V.M. Boscá I. Ortega A. Urzainqui A. O'Connor J.E. Sánchez-Madrid F. Esplugues J.V. Serrador J.M. Immunity. 2006; 24: 753-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These investigators further showed that NOS3 overexpression enhances phosphorylation of the CD3z chain and ZAP70 and increases IFN-γ production. We found that supplementation with an NO donor had no effect on cytokine production after DAHP treatment, suggesting that the predominant effect of NOS uncoupling was mediated by increased O2̇̄ rather than reduced NO production. Of note, DAHP did not increase IL-5, but PEG-SOD lowered its levels below those observed at base line. This suggests that uncoupled NOS does not affect IL-5 production, but that O2̇̄ from other sources likely modulates expression of this cytokine. These findings are in keeping with the notion that various sources of cellular reactive oxygen species can be highly localized and can differentially affect responses to extracellular stimuli. It is interesting to speculate how T cell levels of BH4 might be regulated in the setting of an inflammatory stimulus in vivo. In keeping with our cell culture studies, we found that ovalbumin peptide immunization of OT-II mice increased T cell levels of BH4. For the short term, this should promote NO production and TH1 polarization. In regions of inflammation, the production of reactive oxygen species is commonly increased. Others and we have shown that BH4 is susceptible to degradation by oxidants such as peroxynitrite, the carbonate radical and hydroxyl (16Landmesser U. Dikalov S. Price S.R. McCann L. Fukai T. Holland S.M. Mitch W.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 40Patel K.B. Stratford M.R. Wardman P. Everett S.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we also found that incubation of T cells with the peroxynitrite-generating compound SIN-1 caused oxidation of intracellular BH4 (data not shown). This would likely uncouple T cell NOS enzymes, increase NOS-derived O2̇̄, and promote TH2 cytokine production, leading to resolution of the inflammatory state. In summary, our current findings have two important implications. First, they illustrate that GTPCH-1 expression and activity are markedly enhanced by T cell receptor ligation and that this markedly increases T cell BH4 levels and production of NO. Second, in conditions where BH4 levels are reduced, the NOS enzymes can become an important source of O2̇̄ production, which in turn can alter T cell cytokine production."

As for other G protein-coupled receptors, agonists stimulate sst2A receptor phosphorylation on multiple residues, and phosphorylation at different sites has distinct effects on receptor internalization and uncoupling. To elucidate the spatial and temporal regulation of sst2A receptor phosphorylation, we examined agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of multiple receptor GPCR kinase sites using phospho-site-specific antibodies. SS increased receptor phosphorylation sequentially, first on Ser-341/343 and then on Thr-353/354, followed by receptor internalization. Reversal of receptor phosphorylation was determined by the duration of prior agonist exposure. In acutely stimulated cells, in which most receptors remained on the cell surface, dephosphorylation occurred only on Thr-353/354. In contrast, both Ser-341/343 and Thr-353/354 were rapidly dephosphorylated when cells were stimulated long enough to allow receptor internalization before agonist removal. Consistent with these observations, dephosphorylation of Thr-353/354 was not affected by either hypertonic sucrose or dynasore, which prevent receptor internalization, whereas dephosphorylation of Ser-341/343 was completely blocked. An okadaic acid- and fostriecin-sensitive phosphatase catalyzed the dephosphorylation of Thr-353/354 both intracellularly and at the cell surface. In contrast, dephosphorylation of Ser-341/343 was insensitive to these inhibitors. Our results show that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of neighboring GPCR kinase sites in the sst2A receptor are subject to differential spatial and temporal regulation.

IntroductionG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GRK, GPCR kinase; TMB, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. are the largest class of mammalian cell surface receptors. When stimulated by hormones, neurotransmitters, or other signaling molecules, GPCRs activate heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, which then go on to regulate a variety of enzymes and ion channels to produce changes in second messengers such as cyclic AMP and calcium (1Park P.S. Lodowski D.T. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). These signaling events are exquisitely coordinated to produce the desired effect on cell function. Overwhelming evidence has shown that within minutes of receptor activation, GPCR signaling is attenuated by receptor phosphorylation. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate ligand-activated GPCRs at cytosolic serine and threonine residues (3Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 4Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, the activated receptors recruit arrestins, cytoplasmic proteins that sterically inhibit receptor-G protein coupling thereby desensitizing this signaling pathway. In addition, because arrestins also bind to numerous cytosolic proteins involved in intracellular signaling and receptor trafficking, the recruitment of arrestins by phosphorylated GPCRs leads to the endocytosis of cell surface receptors and to the initiation of G protein-independent signaling events (5Moore C.A. Milano S.K. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 6Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Cleghorn W.M. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2008; 186: 15-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). After endocytosis, GPCRs can follow different intracellular trafficking routes (8Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 9Seachrist J.L. Ferguson S.S. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Some receptors are sorted to lysosomes where they are degraded, whereas others are dephosphorylated in endocytic compartments and then recycled to the cell surface where they are poised for another round of agonist stimulation.Because the phosphorylation state of GPCRs determines both their signaling capacity and their subcellular distribution, elucidating the mechanisms controlling receptor phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is key to understanding GPCR regulation. We now know that GPCRs are often phosphorylated on multiple intracellular Ser and Thr residues, although specific phosphorylation sites have been identified in relatively few receptors (10Tobin A.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: S167-S176Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it seems that each GPCR exists in a mixture of phosphorylation states, with different sites phosphorylated to different extents under various conditions (11Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Trester-Zedlitz M. Burlingame A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 32075-32083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, experiments with mutant receptors missing specific Ser/Thr residues have indicated that phosphorylation of different sites has distinct effects on receptor function (14Tobin A.B. Butcher A.J. Kong K.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, multisite phosphorylation provides a subtle and complex regulatory mechanism for GPCRs, as for many other proteins, and both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of individual receptor sites are likely to be tightly controlled. A number of mathematical models have provided general insights into the molecular mechanisms utilized by cells to regulate protein function by multisite phosphorylation (15Patwardhan P. Miller W.T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2218-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Salazar C. Höfer T. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3177-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At this time, however, the regulation of GPCR function by multisite phosphorylation is too poorly understood to apply such models in a meaningful way. We know little about how GPCR phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at specific receptor residues are regulated, the kinetics and sequence by which these catalytic events occur, or even the cellular compartments where changes in the phosphorylation state of these receptors are brought about.Somatostatin receptors are members of the class A family of GPCRs. Of the five known somatostatin receptor subtypes, the sst2A receptor is the most widely distributed in normal tissues as well as in human tumors (17Schonbrunn A. Lennarz W.J. Lane M.D. Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry. Elsevier, Oxford2004: 55-60Google Scholar, 18Olias G. Viollet C. Kusserow H. Epelbaum J. Meyerhof W. J.

These receptors play a critical role in regulating hormone and neurotransmitter release in the endocrine and neuronal systems and, in addition, modulate a number of gastrointestinal and exocrine processes. Because of its inhibitory effect on tumor cell secretion, the sst2A receptor subtype is an important therapeutic target in the treatment of a variety of neuroendocrine cancers. In addition, it is targeted by the radiolabeled somatostatin analogs used for tumor imaging (20Weckbecker G. Lewis I. Albert R. Schmid H.A. Hoyer D. Bruns C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 999-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 21Reubi J.C. Maecke H.R. J. Nucl. Med. 2008; 49: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of sst2A receptor function will have important therapeutic as well as physiological consequences.We previously showed that sst2A receptors are rapidly internalized and desensitized following SS14 treatment (22Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Both these processes depend on agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation, which occurs independently of G-protein coupling, and is catalyzed by GRKs (22Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Hipkin R.W. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In fact, site-directed mutagenesis has shown that different phosphorylation sites are involved in different aspects of sst2A receptor regulation; phosphorylation of Thr residues in the C terminus of the receptor is required for receptor internalization, and Ser phosphorylation mediates receptor desensitization (25Liu Q. Dewi D.A. Liu W. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To develop a better understanding of the functional roles of Ser and Thr residues in the sst2A receptor, we recently identified a cluster of phosphorylation sites within the C terminus and showed that GRKs and protein kinase C (PKC) specifically phosphorylate distinct residues in this cluster (24Liu Q. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In particular, agonist binding rapidly increased phosphorylation on a pair of Ser residues, Ser-341 and Ser-343, and on a pair of Thr residues, Thr-353 and Thr-354 (24Liu Q. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, we do not know how the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of these sites are coordinated either spatially or temporally. Therefore, we examined the kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at specific receptor residues under conditions of normal receptor trafficking and when receptor internalization was blocked. In addition, using selective inhibitors, we investigated the phosphatases involved in sst2A receptor dephosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that the regulation of GPCR phosphorylation is more complex than previously recognized. Phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation of intracellular Ser/Thr residues are individually controlled leading to an exquisitely choreographed and compartment-specific sequence of catalytic events that produce a pattern of receptor phosphorylation that varies in space and time.DISCUSSIONGPCR signaling and trafficking are stringently regulated by receptor phosphorylation, which usually occurs on multiple Ser and Thr residues in the receptor C terminus or third intracellular loop. Studies with individual GPCRs have suggested that phosphorylation at different sites within these highly phosphorylated receptor domains can have distinct consequences for receptor activity, such that the functional state of the receptor is determined by the particular phosphorylated species that can exist (10Tobin A.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: S167-S176Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 43Celver J. Xu M. Jin W. Lowe J. Chavkin C. Mol.

Chem. 2010; 285: 7805-7817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In fact, this is the case for the sst2A receptor; phosphorylation of Thr residues is necessary for rapid agonist-induced internalization, whereas phosphorylation of Ser residues is responsible for receptor uncoupling (25Liu Q. Dewi D.A. Liu W. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Yet because measurement of receptor phosphorylation at individual phospho-sites is experimentally difficult in intact cells, the detailed regulation of GPCR phosphorylation has been investigated for only a few receptors and is not fully understood with any GPCR.To understand the biochemical mechanisms that control GPCR activity, we characterized the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of two pairs of GRK sites in the C terminus of the sst2A somatostatin receptor in intact cells. Use of phospho-site-specific antibodies and a sensitive ELISA allowed us to quantitate wild type receptor phosphorylation directly and avoid the uncertainties inherent in mutagenesis-based studies. We found that receptor phosphorylation occurred rapidly and in a sequential manner. Mutation of either the pair of residues that are phosphorylated first (Ser-341/343) or the pair phosphorylated subsequently (Thr-353/354) reduced the rate at which the remaining sites were modified suggesting a stringent structural requirement for GRK catalysis that is independent of the hierarchy of receptor phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, the two pairs of phospho-sites were dephosphorylated by distinct phosphatases and in different cellular compartments. Following removal of agonist, Thr-353/354 was subject to dephosphorylation both at the cell surface and in endocytic vesicles, and these reactions were catalyzed by a PP2A/PP4 phosphatase. In contrast, Ser-341/343 was dephosphorylated only after receptor internalization, and the enzyme involved was insensitive to available inhibitors for different phosphatase classes. Thus, the phosphorylation state of the sst2A receptor is controlled by multiple enzymes acting in specific cellular compartments and, as a result, depends on the duration of receptor activation.We used two different experimental methods to measure sst2A receptor phosphorylation in intact cells. Immunoblot analysis was used to detect the phosphorylation of purified receptors, as described in detail previously (24Liu Q. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Accurate quantitation of receptor phosphorylation was performed with a rapid in-cell ELISA. The specificities of the antibodies used for immunoblotting and ELISA were very similar (supplemental Table 1), and as shown by multiple control experiments, all antibodies reacted only with the phosphorylated form of the sst2A receptor (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). When compared, results from immunoblotting and in cell ELISA agreed closely.Although the sst2A receptor can be phosphorylated by PKC as well as by GRKs, the phosphorylation reactions investigated here are catalyzed only by GRKs. Early studies, looking at overall phosphorylation by 32PO4 labeling showed that agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation did not involve second messenger-activated kinases (22Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Hipkin R.W. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2502-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). More recently, using phospho-site-specific antibodies, we showed that neither forskolin nor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated sst2A receptor phosphorylation at Ser-341/343 or Thr-353/354, whereas SS14 rapidly increased phosphorylation at all these sites (24Liu Q. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, siRNA knockdown of GRK2 inhibited SS14-stimulated receptor phosphorylation at both Ser-341/343 (24Liu Q. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Thr-353/354. 3Q. Liu and A. Schonbrunn, unpublished observations. Thus, the phosphorylation reactions examined here are catalyzed by GRK2 and possibly other GRKs as well. This conclusion is consistent with our observation that phosphorylation of Ser-341/343 and Thr-353/354 shows the same agonist dose dependence because receptor phosphorylation by second messenger-activated kinases often occurs at much lower agonist concentrations than GRK-catalyzed receptor phosphorylation (48Pollok-Kopp B.

Clark R.B. Mol.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, the rates with which multiple identified GRK sites are phosphorylated has only been determined for rhodopsin (11Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 50Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (46Busillo J.M. Armando S. Sengupta R. Meucci O. Bouvier M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7805-7817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting to compare the phosphorylation kinetics of the two peptide-activated receptors with the kinetics of rhodopsin phosphorylation. After a flash of light, three Ser residues are phosphorylated in a sequential manner in rhodopsin, with half-times of 0.26 min (Ser-343), 1.4 min (Ser-338), and 13.9 min (Ser-334) (11Kennedy M.J. Lee K.A. Niemi G.A. Craven K.B. Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Hurley J.B. Neuron. 2001; 31: 87-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to SS14 the sst2A receptor is also phosphorylated sequentially and at remarkably similar rates; the half-times for phosphorylation on Ser-341/343 and Thr-353/354 were ∼0.3 and 1.7 min (summarized in Fig. 10). However, in rhodopsin the sites closest to the C terminus are phosphorylated the fastest, whereas in the sst2A receptor, the Ser residues closest to the plasma membrane are phosphorylated first, and the distal Thr are phosphorylated more slowly. The sequence of GRK-mediated CXCR4 phosphorylation is even more complex; GRK-catalyzed phosphorylation occurs first at Ser-339 followed by Ser-324/325 and then Ser-330 (46Busillo J.M. Armando S. Sengupta R. Meucci O. Bouvier M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7805-7817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, a general pattern for multisite phosphorylation of GPCRs by GRKs has yet to emerge.The reason for a time lag in the GRK-catalyzed phosphorylation of residues only a few amino acids apart in all three receptors is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that Ser-341/343 phosphorylation was required for the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-353/354 by comparing the rate of Thr-353/354 phosphorylation in WT receptors and in receptors lacking the Ser phosphorylation sites. Indeed, mutating Ser-341/343 to Ala slowed the rate of Thr-353/354 phosphorylation 4-fold, although it did not block it entirely. Unexpectedly, however, mutating Thr-353/354 to Ala also reduced the rate of Ser-341/343 phosphorylation, even though Ser-341/343 is phosphorylated prior to Thr-353/354 in the WT receptor. These results suggest that mutations affect the phosphorylation of distal receptor residues because of the structural changes they produce rather than by interfering with the normal phosphorylation sequence. Although Ser/Thr mutations often disrupt GPCR phosphorylation at distal sites, our results suggest that such an effect does not demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation occurs in a particular order.An important unanswered question for GPCR regulation is whether dephosphorylation and reactivation of receptors require endocytosis or whether these processes can occur at the plasma membrane. Thus, one of our most striking and unexpected findings was that dephosphorylation of two neighboring GRK sites in the C-tail of the sst2A receptor occurs in different cellular compartments. Because the sst2A receptor internalizes with a half-time of 5 min in the CHO-sst2A cells used in this study (Fig. 6) (25Liu Q. Dewi D.A. Liu W. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), receptor phosphorylation precedes receptor endocytosis (Fig 10), consistent with mutagenesis studies showing that phosphorylation is required for rapid sst2A receptor internalization (25Liu Q. Dewi D.A. Liu W. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our kinetic measurements show that a short pulse of agonist will lead to the plasma membrane accumulation of receptor initially phosphorylated on Ser-341/343 and then on both Ser-341/343 and Thr-353/354 (Fig 10). Following washout of agonist after such a brief stimulation, Thr-353/354 is rapidly dephosphorylated, whereas dephosphorylation of cell surface receptors at Ser-341/343 does not occur. Thus, a new steady state will be established in which cell surface receptors are phosphorylated on Ser-341/343 but not on Thr-353/354 (Fig 10). This will be the phosphorylation state of sst2A receptors following recovery from a short pulse of agonist, as occurs in neurons. In contrast, longer exposure of cells to agonist, as occurs during endocrine or pharmacological stimulation, will lead to the intracellular accumulation of phosphorylated receptors (25Liu Q. Dewi D.A. Liu W. Bee M.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Removal of agonist after the receptor has been internalized permits receptor dephosphorylation at both Ser-341/343 and Thr-353/354 (Fig 10), and the internalized dephosphorylated receptor is then recycled to the cell surface over the next hour. 4Y. J. Kao, M. Ghosh, and A. Schonbrunn, submitted for publication.The compartment-specific dephosphorylation of adjacent GRK sites in the sst2A receptor is particularly interesting because previous studies with other GPCRs differ as to whether endocytosis is required for receptor dephosphorylation. For example, internalization of CXCR2 receptors is essential for receptor dephosphorylation following agonist stimulation (33Yang W. Wang D. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11328-11333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the β2-adrenergic receptor (37Iyer V. Tran T.M. Foster E. Dai W. Clark R.B. Knoll B.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (29Jones B.W. Song G.J. Greuber E.K. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12893-12906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) can be dephosphorylated both at the cell membrane and intracellularly. However, to our knowledge, the sst2A receptor provides the first example of a GPCR in which neighboring GRK sites are dephosphorylated in distinct compartments. An important consequence of such site-specific dephosphorylation is that the phosphorylation state of the receptor will be determined by its subcellular distribution and will therefore vary with the time of agonist stimulation (Fig 10). Such differential dephosphorylation may explain why inhibitors of internalization can prevent resensitization of GPCRs in which some dephosphorylation occurs on the cell surface (35Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 37Iyer V. Tran T.M. Foster E. Dai W. Clark R.B. Knoll B.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The phosphatases that catalyze GPCR dephosphorylation have not been identified, and their sensitivity to inhibitors varies greatly. For example, okadaic acid inhibits the dephosphorylation of β2-adrenergic, CCR5, and κ-opioid receptors (48Pollok-Kopp B. Schwarze K. Baradari V.K. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2190-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 51Tran T.M. Friedman J. Baameur F. Knoll B.J. Moore R.H. Clark R.B. Mol.

Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12893-12906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In intact cells, okadaic acid will inhibit PP2A, PP4, PP5, and PP6 at concentrations of 10–100 nm, although it will also inhibit PP1 at a concentration of 1 μm or greater (41Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S.

In our study, okadaic acid did not affect sst2A receptor dephosphorylation at Ser-341/343, even at a concentration of 1 μm. In contrast, nanomolar concentrations of okadaic acid blocked receptor dephosphorylation at Thr-353/354. Interestingly okadaic acid was equipotent at inhibiting Thr-353/354 dephosphorylation at the cell surface and intracellularly, suggesting that the same enzyme is responsible for catalyzing Thr-353/354 dephosphorylation in both compartments. Fostriecin, a potent inhibitor of PP2A and PP4 but not of PP1 and PP5 (42Single M. Ni L. Honkanen R.E. Moorhead G. Protein Phosphatase Protocol. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2007: 23-38Google Scholar) also had phospho-site-specific effects on sst2A receptor dephosphorylation, inhibiting Thr-353/354 dephosphorylation without affecting dephosphorylation at Ser-341/343. Inhibition of PP2B with FK506 did not block either Ser-341/343 or Thr-353/354 dephosphorylation. Together these results demonstrate that at least two different phosphatases catalyze sst2A receptor dephosphorylation (Table 1 and Fig 10). A PP2A/PP4 phosph"

We found that KGF augments pulmonary host defenses to Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in part through GM-CSF-dependent macrophage recruitment and activation.DISCUSSIONKGF is an epithelial mitogen and differentiation factor that is known to protect the lung from a variety of insults. There have been only a few reports of potential effects of KGF on pulmonary host defense. We found that KGF indeed enhances the rate of bacterial clearance from the lung through a novel mechanism that is at least partially GM-CSF dependent.Nature often borrows elements of normal developmental processes to execute repair and host defense functions in the mature organism (27Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Examples include the key roles of NFκB pathway proteins both in Drosophila morphogenesis and in inflammation in mammalian organisms. The importance of KGF in lung development is graphically demonstrated by the absence of lungs in mice that overexpress a dominant-negative form of KGF receptor, FGFR2-IIIb, in the pulmonary epithelium (28Peters K. Werner S. Liao X. Wert S. Whitsett J. Williams L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3296-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Using a similar strategy with a skin-specific promoter, KGF signaling has also been shown to be critical for wound repair in that organ (29Li C. Guo H. Xu X. Weinberg W. Deng C.X. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The documented efficacy of KGF in reducing the severity of mucositis following radiation and chemotherapy illustrates the protective potential of KGF for epithelial and mucosal tissues (30Spielberger R. Stiff P. Bensinger W. Gentile T. Weisdorf D. Kewalramani T. Shea T. Yanovich S. Hansen K. Noga S. McCarty J. LeMaistre C.F. Sung E.C. Blazar B.R. Elhardt D. Chen M.G. Emmanouilides C. N. Engl. J.

Although the mechanism of KGF action in the amelioration of mucositis is thought to be preservation of epithelial barrier integrity, infection is also central to the pathogenesis of the disease, and we wondered if the antimicrobial actions of KGF might have also contributed to the favorable outcomes in those studies. Reports that KGF is up-regulated in gingival fibroblasts by LPS and inflammatory cytokines (IL1α, IL1β, IL6, TNFα, TGFα, and PDGF-BB) (31Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol.

(17Viget N.B. Guery B.P. Ader F. Nevière R. Alfandari S. Creuzy C. Roussel-Delvallez M. Foucher C. Mason C.M. Beaucaire G. Pittet J.F. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1199-L1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a single intratracheal instillation of KGF (5 mg/kg) in rats 48 h prior to infection with P. aeruginosa resulted in improved barrier function in vivo and in isolated perfused lungs, increased macrophage and infection-induced neutrophil recruitment, and enhanced bacterial clearance. The mechanism of these effects was not resolved in that study, however.In the current study, KGF enhanced the clearance of two Gram-negative pathogens from the lungs of mice ∼4–6-fold within 1 or 24 h of administration of the growth factor. To determine the mechanism of augmented pulmonary defense, we assessed the effect of KGF on the antimicrobial functions of alveolar macrophages. The observation that a GM-CSF-dependent increase in bacterial clearance occurs within 1 h of KGF administration directly implicates macrophage activation rather than increases in macrophage recruitment, collectins, or neutrophils in the KGF effect. Treatment of mice with KGF by the respiratory route more than doubled the number of alveolar macrophages in the airspace over a 3-day period, but there were no significant changes in BAL inflammatory cell counts or composition at earlier time points (Fig. 2A), so it is unlikely that recruitment of circulating monocytes explains the early phenotypic changes in the alveolar macrophages associated with enhanced bacterial clearance at 24 h. KGF clearly increased the phagocytic and oxidative tone of alveolar macrophages within this time frame, however. Much less robust effects on inflammatory cell activation were observed with parenteral (intraperitoneal) administration of KGF; but daily dosing of KGF for 3 days produced the same level of superoxide release that was induced by a single dose of intranasal KGF. The KGF-induced macrophage actions were preceded by an increase in the secretion of a number of cytokines and chemokines into the airspace, including GM-CSF. In vitro experiments were performed in which each of these factors, individually and in combination, were tested for the ability to recapitulate the activation phenotype of macrophages isolated from KGF-pretreated animals. Of these, only GM-CSF primed macrophages for nitric oxide production upon exposure to LPS. On this basis, we postulated that GM-CSF was the principal mediator of the macrophage-activating functions induced by KGF.GM-CSF is a hematopoetic growth factor that is known to be important for pulmonary homeostasis (35Stanley E. Lieschke G.J. Grail D. Metcalf D. Hodgson G. Gall J.A. Maher D.W. Cebon J. Sinickas V. Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 5592-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). GM-CSF promotes the terminal differentiation and survival of myeloid cells and is expressed by a variety of cells in the lung including activated T cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and pulmonary epithelial cells (36Paine 3rd, R. Preston A.M. Wilcoxen S. Jin H. Siu B.B. Morris S.B. Reed J.A. Ross G. Whitsett J.A. Beck J.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2602-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). GM-CSF plays a central role in surfactant homeostasis and in the terminal differentiation of alveolar macrophages through binding to the GM-CSF receptor on the phagocyte, activation of JAK-STAT signaling, and induction of the transcription factor PU.1 (37Trapnell B.C. Whitsett J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 775-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The absence of GM-CSF in gene-targeted mice results in susceptibility to infection with bacterial and fungal organisms, due primarily to deficits in alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, H2O2 production, and killing (36Paine 3rd, R. Preston A.M. Wilcoxen S. Jin H. Siu B.B. Morris S.B. Reed J.A. Ross G. Whitsett J.A. Beck J.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2602-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 37Trapnell B.C.

Invest. 1999; 103: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). GM-CSF−/− mice also exhibit surfactant accumulation, and increased bacterial dissemination, defective inflammatory mediator responses, and reduced survival despite preserved neutrophil recruitment and function after intratracheal challenge with P. aeruginosa (39Ballinger M.N. Paine 3rd, R. Serezani C.H. Aronoff D.M. Choi E.S. Standiford T.J. Toews G.B. Moore B.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 34: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).In our study, the primary source of GM-CSF following KGF induction was the alveolar epithelium, based on the detection of GM-CSF in isolated type II cells but not isolated alveolar macrophages of KGF-pretreated animals and in cultures of KGF challenged alveolar cells isolated from animals that had not been pretreated. GM-CSF levels in BAL and lung homogenate peaked within 1 h of intrapulmonary treatment with KGF. The accelerated kinetics of secretion of GM-CSF is atypical for mechanisms requiring protein synthesis, and suggests the possibility of release from mobilizable, intracellular or cell surface bound stores, as has been described for other growth factors (40Grenier A. Chollet-Martin S. Crestani B. Delarche C. El Benna J. Boutten A. Andrieu V. Durand G. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Aubier M. Dehoux M. Blood. 2002; 99: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The GM-CSF spike was followed by a trailing, sustained increase in STAT5 phosphorylation in alveolar macrophages. The KGF-induced augmentation of bacterial clearance, and alveolar macrophage STAT5 phosphorylation, recruitment, and nitric oxide response to LPS were all absent in GM-CSF-deficient mice. Although we used young mice (5 weeks) to minimize the effect that accumulation of surfactant may have had on the macrophage phenotype in these animals (16Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B. Rashid A. Bronson R.T. Dickersin G.R. Bachurski C.J. Mark E.L. Whitsett J.A. Mulligan R.C. Science. 1994; 264: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that collateral effects of GM-CSF deficiency may have influenced GM-CSF-dependent macrophage functions. Increased levels of surfactant proteins in these animals may also effect bacterial clearance through direct antimicrobial (25Wu H. Kuzmenko A. Wan S. Schaffer L. Weiss A. Fisher J.H. Kim K.S. McCormack F.X. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1589-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and phagocyte-dependent mechanisms (41Manz-Keinke H. Plattner H. Schlepper-Schäfer J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 95-100PubMed Google Scholar), but if anything would have biased the result in the direction opposite to what was observed.Collectively, these data are consistent with a model in which KGF stimulates pulmonary innate immunity. KGF enhances the recruitment, oxidant, and killing functions of alveolar macrophages, and accelerates the clearance of Gram-negative pathogens through GM-CSF-dependent mechanisms. We submit that pharmacologic augmentation of macrophage activation through a KGF/FGFR2-IIIb/GM-CSF/GM-CSFR paracrine loop might be exploited to advantage, to enhance host defense functions in the airspace. These findings may have implications for the treatment of patients with pneumonias for which no effective treatment exists (e.g. viral pneumonias) or which fail to respond adequately to available treatments.

GM-CSF−/− mice also exhibit surfactant accumulation, and increased bacterial dissemination, defective inflammatory mediator responses, and reduced survival despite preserved neutrophil recruitment and function after intratracheal challenge with P. aeruginosa (39Ballinger M.N.

GM-CSF levels in BAL and lung homogenate peaked within 1 h of intrapulmonary treatment with KGF. The accelerated kinetics of secretion of GM-CSF is atypical for mechanisms requiring protein synthesis, and suggests the possibility of release from mobilizable, intracellular or cell surface bound stores, as has been described for other growth factors (40Grenier A. Chollet-Martin S. Crestani B. Delarche C. El Benna J. Boutten A. Andrieu V. Durand G. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Aubier M. Dehoux M. Blood. 2002; 99: 2997-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The GM-CSF spike was followed by a trailing, sustained increase in STAT5 phosphorylation in alveolar macrophages. The KGF-induced augmentation of bacterial clearance, and alveolar macrophage STAT5 phosphorylation, recruitment, and nitric oxide response to LPS were all absent in GM-CSF-deficient mice. Although we used young mice (5 weeks) to minimize the effect that accumulation of surfactant may have had on the macrophage phenotype in these animals (16Dranoff G. Crawford A.D. Sadelain M. Ream B.

Increased levels of surfactant proteins in these animals may also effect bacterial clearance through direct antimicrobial (25Wu H. Kuzmenko A. Wan S. Schaffer L. Weiss A. Fisher J.H. Kim K.S.

KGF enhances the recruitment, oxidant, and killing functions of alveolar macrophages, and accelerates the clearance of Gram-negative pathogens through GM-CSF-dependent mechanisms. We submit that pharmacologic augmentation of macrophage activation through a KGF/FGFR2-IIIb/GM-CSF/GM-CSFR paracrine loop might be exploited to advantage, to enhance host defense functions in the airspace. These findings may have implications for the treatment of patients with pneumonias for which no effective treatment exists (e.g. viral pneumonias) or which fail to respond adequately to available treatments. KGF is an epithelial mitogen and differentiation factor that is known to protect the lung from a variety of insults. There have been only a few reports of potential effects of KGF on pulmonary host defense. We found that KGF indeed enhances the rate of bacterial clearance from the lung through a novel mechanism that is at least partially GM-CSF dependent. Nature often borrows elements of normal developmental processes to execute repair and host defense functions in the mature organism (27Whitsett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Examples include the key roles of NFκB pathway proteins both in Drosophila morphogenesis and in inflammation in mammalian organisms. The importance of KGF in lung development is graphically demonstrated by the absence of lungs in mice that overexpress a dominant-negative form of KGF receptor, FGFR2-IIIb, in the pulmonary epithelium (28Peters K. Werner S. Liao X. Wert S. Whitsett J. Williams L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3296-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Using a similar strategy with a skin-specific promoter, KGF signaling has also been shown to be critical for wound repair in that organ (29Li C. Guo H. Xu X. Weinberg W. Deng C.X. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The documented efficacy of KGF in reducing the severity of mucositis following radiation and chemotherapy illustrates the protective potential of KGF for epithelial and mucosal tissues (30Spielberger R. Stiff P. Bensinger W. Gentile T. Weisdorf D. Kewalramani T. Shea T. Yanovich S. Hansen K. Noga S. McCarty J. LeMaistre C.F. Sung E.C. Blazar B.R. Elhardt D. Chen M.G. Emmanouilides C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of KGF action in the amelioration of mucositis is thought to be preservation of epithelial barrier integrity, infection is also central to the pathogenesis of the disease, and we wondered if the antimicrobial actions of KGF might have also contributed to the favorable outcomes in those studies. Reports that KGF is up-regulated in gingival fibroblasts by LPS and inflammatory cytokines (IL1α, IL1β, IL6, TNFα, TGFα, and PDGF-BB) (31Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol.

Res. 2002; 37: 66-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that KGF stimulates the production of antimicrobial peptides and enhances bactericidal activity of skin grafts by more than 500-fold (34Erdag G. Medalie D.A. Rakhorst H. Krueger G.G. Morgan J.R. Mol. Ther. 2004; 10: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are consistent with a role for the growth factor in the augmentation of innate immune defenses. Viget et al. (17Viget N.B. Guery B.P. Ader F. Nevière R. Alfandari S. Creuzy C. Roussel-Delvallez M. Foucher C. Mason C.M. Beaucaire G. Pittet J.F. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1199-L1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a single intratracheal instillation of KGF (5 mg/kg) in rats 48 h prior to infection with P. aeruginosa resulted in improved barrier function in vivo and in isolated perfused lungs, increased macrophage and infection-induced neutrophil recruitment, and enhanced bacterial clearance. The mechanism of these effects was not resolved in that study, however. In the current study, KGF enhanced the clearance of two Gram-negative pathogens from the lungs of mice ∼4–6-fold within 1 or 24 h of administration of the growth factor. To determine the mechanism of augmented pulmonary defense, we assessed the effect of KGF on the antimicrobial functions of alveolar macrophages. The observation that a GM-CSF-dependent increase in bacterial clearance occurs within 1 h of KGF administration directly implicates macrophage activation rather than increases in macrophage recruitment, collectins, or neutrophils in the KGF effect. Treatment of mice with KGF by the respiratory route more than doubled the number of alveolar macrophages in the airspace over a 3-day period, but there were no significant changes in BAL inflammatory cell counts or composition at earlier time points (Fig. 2A), so it is unlikely that recruitment of circulating monocytes explains the early phenotypic changes in the alveolar macrophages associated with enhanced bacterial clearance at 24 h. KGF clearly increased the phagocytic and oxidative tone of alveolar macrophages within this time frame, however. Much less robust effects on inflammatory cell activation were observed with parenteral (intraperitoneal) administration of KGF; but daily dosing of KGF for 3 days produced the same level of superoxide release that was induced by a single dose of intranasal KGF. The KGF-induced macrophage actions were preceded by an increase in the secretion of a number of cytokines and chemokines into the airspace, including GM-CSF. In vitro experiments were performed in which each of these factors, individually and in combination, were tested for the ability to recapitulate the activation phenotype of macrophages isolated from KGF-pretreated animals. Of these, only GM-CSF primed macrophages for nitric oxide production upon exposure to LPS. On this basis, we postulated that GM-CSF was the principal mediator of the macrophage-activating functions induced by KGF. GM-CSF is a hematopoetic growth factor that is known to be important for pulmonary homeostasis (35Stanley E. Lieschke G.J. Grail D. Metcalf D. Hodgson G. Gall J.A. Maher D.W. Cebon J. Sinickas V. Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 5592-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). GM-CSF promotes the terminal differentiation and survival of myeloid cells and is expressed by a variety of cells in the lung including activated T cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and pulmonary epithelial cells (36Paine 3rd, R. Preston A.M. Wilcoxen S. Jin H. Siu B.B. Morris S.B. Reed J.A. Ross G. Whitsett J.A. Beck J.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2602-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). GM-CSF plays a central role in surfactant homeostasis and in the terminal differentiation of alveolar macrophages through binding to the GM-CSF receptor on the phagocyte, activation of JAK-STAT signaling, and induction of the transcription factor PU.1 (37Trapnell B.C. Whitsett J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 775-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1983846800,"This study examined the role of the Gα(q) signal constituted by Gα(q) and Gα(11) (encoded by Gnα(q) and Gnα(11), respectively), a major intracellular pathway of parathyroid hormone (PTH), in the PTH osteoanabolic action by the gain- and loss-of-function analyses. Transgenic mice with osteoblast-specific overexpression of the constitutively active Gnα(q) gene under the control of 2.3-kb type I collagen α1 chain (Col1a1) promoter exhibited osteopenia with decreased bone formation parameters and did not respond to the daily PTH treatment. We then established osteoblast-specific Gnα(q) and Gnα(11) double-knock-out (cDKO) mice by crossing the 2.3-kb Col1a1 promoter-Cre recombinase transgenic mice and those with Gnα(q) gene flanked with loxP and global ablation of Gnα(11) (Col1a1-Cre(+/-);Gna(q)(fl/fl);Gna(11)(-/-)) and found that the cDKO and single knock-out littermates of Gnα(q) or Gnα(11) exhibited normal bone volume and turnover under physiological conditions. With a daily injection of PTH, however, the cDKO mice, but not the single knock-out mice, showed higher bone volume and turnover than the wild-type littermates. Cultures of primary osteoblasts derived from cDKO and wild-type littermates confirmed enhancement of the PTH osteoanabolic action by the Gα(q) signal deficiency in a cell-autonomous mechanism, in association with the membrane translocation of protein kinase Cδ. This enhancement was reproduced by overexpression of regulator of G protein signaling-2, a Gα(q) signal inhibitor, in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Hence, the Gα(q) signal plays an inhibitory role in the PTH osteoanabolic action, suggesting that its suppression may lead to a novel treatment in combination with PTH against osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2144173086,"The GES-2 β-lactamase is a class A carbapenemase, the emergence of which in clinically important bacterial pathogens is a disconcerting development as the enzyme confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. Tazobactam is a clinically used inhibitor of class A β-lactamases, which inhibits the GES-2 enzyme effectively, restoring susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. We have investigated the details of the mechanism of inhibition of the GES-2 enzyme by tazobactam. By the use of UV spectrometry, mass spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography, we have documented and identified the involvement of a total of seven distinct GES-2·tazobactam complexes and one product of the hydrolysis of tazobactam that contribute to the inhibition profile. The x-ray structures for the GES-2 enzyme are for both the native (1.45 Å) and the inhibited complex with tazobactam (1.65 Å). This is the first such structure of a carbapenemase in complex with a clinically important β-lactam inhibitor, shedding light on the structural implications for the inhibition process."
https://openalex.org/W2149908975,"Single-channel conductance in Cys-loop channels is controlled by the nature of the amino acids in the narrowest parts of the ion conduction pathway, namely the second transmembrane domain (M2) and the intracellular helix. In cationic channels, such as Torpedo ACh nicotinic receptors, conductance is increased by negatively charged residues exposed to the extracellular vestibule. We now show that positively charged residues at the same loop 5 position boost also the conductance of anionic Cys-loop channels, such as glycine (α1 and α1β) and GABAA (α1β2γ2) receptors. Charge reversal mutations here produce a greater decrease on outward conductance, but their effect strongly depends on which subunit carries the mutation. In the glycine α1β receptor, replacing Lys with Glu in α1 reduces single-channel conductance by 41%, but has no effect in the β subunit. By expressing concatameric receptors with constrained stoichiometry, we show that this asymmetry is not explained by the subunit copy number. A similar pattern is observed in the α1β2γ2 GABAA receptor, where only mutations in α1 or β2 decreased conductance (to different extents). In both glycine and GABA receptors, the effect of mutations in different subunits does not sum linearly: mutations that had no detectable effect in isolation did enhance the effect of mutations carried by other subunits. As in the nicotinic receptor, charged residues in the extracellular vestibule of anionic Cys-loop channels influence elementary conductance. The size of this effect strongly depends on the direction of the ion flow and, unexpectedly, on the nature of the subunit that carries the residue.

The size of this effect strongly depends on the direction of the ion flow and, unexpectedly, on the nature of the subunit that carries the residue. Channels in the nicotinic superfamily are formed by five subunits arranged quasi-symmetrically around the central pore. Structural information from the Torpedo acetylcholine nicotinic receptor and related prokaryotic channels, such as GLIC and ELIC (all cation-permeable), shows that the conduction path for ions starts with a wide vestibule formed by the extracellular domains (1Unwin N.

This tapers to a narrower transmembrane region, which is lined mainly by the second transmembrane domains (M2) of each of the five subunits. In eukaryotic channels, this is connected to the cytoplasm by openings in the subunits intracellular domains, which are formed by the M3-M4 loop. The rate of ion flow along this pathway (and therefore the single-channel conductance) is strongly affected by the nature of the residues that line it, especially those that line the narrowest parts. In particular, there are rings of charged amino acids at the extracellular and intracellular ends of the transmembrane part of the pore (positions −4′ and 20′ in the M2 domain (4Imoto K. Busch C.

Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It was recently found that single-channel conductance can also be influenced by residues in the extracellular domain (ECD). The first clue came from the structure of a member of the family of ACh-binding proteins (AChBP), molluscan homopentameric soluble proteins, which are homologous to the ECD part of nicotinic channels. In the structure of the Aplysia AChBP crystallized in the presence of sulfate or phosphate ions, a positively charged Arg residue in position 97 in loop 5 coordinates the negatively charged sulfate or phosphate ion (6Hansen S.B.

AChBPs do not function as ion channels, but cation-permeable nicotinic channels, such as the Torpedo ACh receptor and the 5-HT3A receptor, have a negatively charged Asp in the equivalent position (97 for the α1 Torpedo nicotinic subunit). Reversing or neutralizing this charge markedly decreases the single-channel conductance of these receptors (6Hansen S.B. Wang H.L. Taylor P. Sine S.M. J. Biol.

In the anion-permeable channels in this superfamily, such as glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 2The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GlyR, glycine receptor. channels, the amino acid in this position is a positively charged Lys, suggesting that this residue is exposed to the vestibule and is important as a conductance determinant in the whole nicotinic superfamily. In the present study, we investigated the effect of reversing from positive to negative the charge in this position in homomeric and heteromeric glycine channels and in GABAA channels. We show that this decreases the single channel conductance especially for outward currents (i.e. when chloride ions enter the vestibule and the channel from the extracellular medium). An unexpected feature of our findings is that the magnitude of the conductance change depends very strongly on which subunit carries the mutation. No effect is seen if the β subunit (in glycine receptors) or the γ subunit (in GABAA receptors) is mutated, unless other subunits in the receptors are also mutated. In glycine receptors, the unequal contribution of the α and β subunits was not due to the different number of copies of each subunit in the pentamer. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293) (American Type Culture Collection-CRL-1573; LGC Promochem) were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air/5% CO2 incubator in DMEM supplemented with 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen). Cells (passaged every 2–3 days, up to 30 times) were plated 2 h before transfection by calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation (details in Ref. 9Groot-Kormelink P.J. Beato M. Finotti C. Harvey R.J. Sivilotti L.G. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2002; 113: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rat α1 and β GlyR subunits (GenBankTM accession numbers AJ310834 and AJ310839) were transfected at a ratio of 1:40 to minimize contamination by homomeric α1 receptors (10Burzomato V. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Sivilotti L.G. Beato M. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with a total amount of 3 μg of cDNA per dish. Rat α1, β2, and γ2L (long isoform) GABAA receptor subunits (GenBankTM accession numbers AY574250, AY574251, AY574252) were transfected at a ratio of 1:1:4. All recordings were carried out 24–72 h after transfection. All subunits were subcloned into the pCI vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were full-length sequenced. As shown in alignment in Fig. 1E, the position of the extracellular conductance determinant is: for GlyR subunits Lys-104 in α1 or Lys-127 in β; for GABAA receptor subunits Lys-105 and Lys-106 in α1, Lys-101 and Lys-102 in β2, Lys-117 and Lys-118 in γ2 (numbering as in the mature peptide). Gly α1 and β subunits were linked by an 18-amino acid linker (six repeats of Ala-Gly-Ser) connecting the C-terminal of the α1 subunit to the N-terminal of the β subunit. 2 runs of PCR were performed on each subunit. The first run eliminated the stop codon from the α1 subunit and the signal peptide from the β subunit. The second run of PCR added EcoRI at the 5′-end of the α1 subunit and an (AGS)3 repeat followed by XhoI at the 3′-end. At the 5′-end of the β subunit XhoI was added followed by an (AGS)3 repeat, whereas at the 3′-end NotI was inserted for subsequent cloning into a plasmid. The α1 and β subunits were then subcloned one at a time into a new pCI vector between EcoRI/XhoI and XhoI/NotI. The whole construct was then fully sequenced. The resulting construct is very similar to that previously used successfully to express a 2α:3β stoichiometry in oocytes (11Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), with the slight difference that in that study the α1 C terminus was shortened by 4 amino acids and 7 AGS repeats were used. An identical approach was used to create β_α1 dimers. To maintain the effective length of the linker between subunits despite the much shorter C-terminal of the leading β subunit (1 amino acid only), β_α1 dimers were joined with AGS repeats of different length (6, 8, and 10) and we tested all of these constructs. For expression in oocytes, all cDNAs were linearized immediately downstream of the 3′-UTR with BamHI, and capped cRNAs were transcribed using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, UK). The quality of the cRNA molecules was checked by RNA gel-electrophoresis. Female Xenopus laevis frogs, anesthetized by immersion in neutralized ethyl m-aminobenzoate solution (tricaine, methanesulfonate salt; 0.2% solution w/v, Sigma), were killed by concussion immediately followed by decapitation and destruction of brain and spinal cord before removal of the ovarian lobes. This procedure is in accordance with United Kingdom Home Office regulations. The study protocol does not fall under the remit of the UCL Research Ethics Committee. Clumps of stage V-VI oocytes were dissected in a sterile modified Barth's solution consisting of (in mm): 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 0.82 MgCl2, 0.77 CaCl2, 2.4 NaHCO3, 15 Tris-HCl, with 10 units/ml of penicillin and 10 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) in HPLC water; pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. The dissected oocytes were placed in OR2 solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH) and defolliculated manually. In the same manner as for HEK cells, wild-type or mutant RNAs coding for the α1 and β subunits were injected at a 1:40 molar ratio to minimize contamination by α1 homomeric channels. Wild-type or mutant α1_β tandem and β monomer constructs were injected at a 1:2 molar ratio. When attempting to express receptors with 3α:2β stoichiometry, α1_β tandem and α1monomer constructs were injected at a 40:1 ratio. Each oocyte was injected with a total of 20 ng of cRNA (in 36 nl of RNase-free water), using a Nanoject Automatic Oocyte Injector (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA), and then incubated for ∼72 h at 18 °C in fresh Barth's solution containing 5% heat-inactivated horse serum. Experiments were carried out 3–4 days from injection. All recordings from HEK293 cells or Xenopus oocytes were performed in the cell-attached configuration. Electrodes were pulled from thick-walled Clark borosilicate glass GC150F (Harvard Instruments), coated near the tip with Sylgard 184® (Dow Corning) and fire-polished prior to use to a final resistance of 6–12 MΩ. The oocyte vitelline membrane was removed by hand after incubating the oocytes for 10 min in stripping solution (Table 1).TABLE 1Solutions used throughout the recordingsCompoundStripping solutionS1S2S3S4Na-gluconate205.4K-gluconate200NaCl102.75.45.4KCl202142170273.6CaCl22222MgCl211111HEPES10101010EGTA10MES10TEA-Cl202020Sucrose1515pH7.67.47.46.07.4 Open table in a new tab Single-channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, pre-filtered at 10 kHz (using the 4-pole Bessel filter of the amplifier). The signal was then passed through an 8-pole Bessel filter (fc = 5 kHz) and digitized to the computer with a sampling rate of 50 kHz, using a Digidata 1322A and Clampex 8.1. All recording solutions are listed in Table 1. Glycine and GABA were used to elicit channel opening and were freshly added to the pipette solutions from a 1 m frozen stock (final concentrations, 0.2 and 10 mm, respectively). Single-channel current-voltage relationships were obtained from different patches for inward and outward currents, using different recording solutions. This was done to make the signal of interest as big as possible. Thus, inward currents from either glycine or GABAA receptors were recorded in the sodium-based S1 external solution (Table 1) both in the bath and in the pipette. In this case the true transmembrane potential is the pipette holding potential minus the cell resting potential (this is not important as we measure slope conductances throughout). For glycine channels, outward currents (i.e. at positive holding potentials) were recorded with high- K+ S2 solution (both in the bath and in the pipette). In this solution, the resting potential of the cell is depolarized to 0 mV. Consequently, the pipette holding potential values, as shown in the figures and in “Results” are the true transmembrane potentials. Because of the low conductance of GABAA receptors, recording of outward currents were performed with the high K+ S2 solution in the bath and with a low-pH, high-chloride (200 mm) solution (S3) in the pipette to increase the channel conductance. The effects of both pH and chloride concentration on the GABAA conductance are well-known (12Bormann J. Hamill O.P. Sakmann B. J. Physiol. 1987; 385: 243-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 13Mortensen M. Ebert B. Wafford K. Smart T.G. J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 1251-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). At the agonist concentrations we used, openings occurred in clusters. Before analysis the traces were digitally filtered at 1 KHz using Clampfit 9.2 (Molecular Devices). Openings were detected by threshold-crossing measurement using Clampfit 9.2. Slope conductance values at positive and negative holding potentials were obtained by plotting current-voltage curves, and by fitting a straight line to the data points (each point was the average of 50 to 500 openings) in Equation 1,γ=I/V+C(Eq.1) where γ is the slope of the line, I is the single current measured, V is the voltage and C is the reversal potential (Prism 5, Graphpad). Only openings longer than 0.8 ms (more than twice the value of rise-time of the filter) were included in the analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test (Prism 5, Graphpad). For clarity, the tables show only the significance of comparisons of each mutant to the appropriate wild-type, and other comparisons are reported in the text. The alignment of loop 5 sequences of Cys-loop receptors in Fig. 1E shows that the position of the extracellular conductance determinant (6Hansen S.B. Wang H.L. Taylor P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36066-36070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is occupied by a negatively charged Asp (bold) in the α1 subunit of the Torpedo ACh nicotinic receptor, which is cation-permeable, and by positively charged Lys residues in subunits from the glycine (Gly) and GABAA receptors, which are anion-permeable. The traces in Fig. 1, A and C show the changes in single-channel currents of α1 Gly homomeric receptors produced by reversing the charge at this position (104) by mutating Lys to Glu. We measured the channel slope conductance from cell-attached recordings such as those shown, both at negative transmembrane potentials (where the current is inward because chloride exits the cell, Fig. 1, A and B) and at positive transmembrane potentials (where chloride enters the cell, Fig. 1, C and D). These experiments were done on different patches to allow us to use different recording solutions, chosen to maximize the signal in each of the two protocols. The traces and the plot show that charge reversal in the extracellular vestibule of α1 (i.e. five copies of Lys mutated to Glu) produced only a modest decrease in the slope conductance of inward currents (about 22.0%, Table 2). The same mutation had a much more marked effect on the outward channel conductance, which decreased by 72.4%. It is not particularly surprising that a mutation in the extracellular vestibule has a greater effect on the flow of chloride ions from the external medium to the inside of the cell. Previous work on the single-channel conductance of Gly receptors reported that mutations in the intracellular membrane-associated helix (in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop) affected more markedly the flow of chloride in the opposite direction, from the cytoplasm to the extracellular medium (14Carland J.E. Cooper M.A. Sugiharto S. Jeong H.J. Lewis T.M. Barry P.H. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Moorhouse A.J. J. Biol.

While our report was in preparation, it was reported that, in homomeric α1 GlyR expressed in HEK cells, charge neutralization at the same position (by mutation to Ala) reduced slope conductance to a smaller extent (−40%, Ref. 7Brams M.

Open table in a new tab We next investigated the effect of the same charge reversal mutation on the conductance of heteromeric α1β GlyR, where residues in the α1 and β subunits can be mutated independently. The traces in Fig. 2A (rightmost column) show that the extracellular charge reversal mutations had virtually no effect on the conductance of inward currents through heteromeric glycine receptors, even if all the subunits were mutated and five negative charges are inserted (double mutants, α1KEβKE, 24.7 ± 1.5 pS, Fig. 2B and Table 2). This is in contrast with the modest, but consistent decrease in inward conductance observed with five copies of the homologous mutation in homomeric channels. Next, we measured the outward slope conductance for the heteromeric α1β GlyR mutated in either the α or the β subunit or in both. As in homomeric receptors, the outward conductance was much more sensitive to charge reversal in the extracellular domain than the inward conductance. Unexpectedly, the contribution of α and β subunits was very different. In particular, replacing Lys with Glu in the β subunit alone (α1βKE) had very little effect (−8%, 30.5 ± 0.6 pS), whereas the homologous mutation on the α1 subunit (α1KEβ) decreased outward conductance by as much as 41% (19.6 ± 1.5 pS, p < 0.001, Table 2). With the double mutant channel (α1KEβKE), which contains five copies of the charge reversal mutation, we observed a pronounced decrease in conductance (−67.8%, 10.7 ± 0.8 pS), greater than that produced by mutating either the α or the β subunit alone (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C, rightmost column, and square symbols in the current-voltage plots in Fig. 2D). The size of this effect was similar to that seen when all subunits are mutated in the homomeric channel (α1KE, a 72.4% reduction from wild-type conductance). In the Torpedo nicotinic receptor, a minimum of three subunits had to be mutated in the homologous position for the change in conductance to be large enough to be detectable (6Hansen S.B. Wang H.L. Taylor P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36066-36070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similarly, conductance mutations in the intracellular domain have no effect if present only in two of the five subunits (4Imoto K. Busch C. Sakmann B. Mishina M. Konno T. Nakai J. Bujo H. Mori Y. Fukuda K. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 5Kelley S.P. Dunlop J.I. Kirkness E.F. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that mutations in the β subunit appear to have no effect on α1β GlyR conductance because this channel contains only two copies of β (as proposed by (10Burzomato V.

Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we constrained the heteromeric receptor to have three copies of the β subunit and a 2α:3β stoichiometry by means of a tandem construct (α1_β), as previously described, i.e. with a linker made of 7 AGS repeats (11Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Because expression in HEK cells of α1_β together with a monomeric β subunit failed to produce any whole-cell current (data not shown), we performed the experiments in Xenopus oocytes. In this expression system, the same combination expressed robust currents that were dependent on co-injection of monomer β subunit constructs (i.e. α1_β tandem construct alone did not express functional GlyR, see supplemental Fig. S1). The cell-attached traces in Fig. 3A show the effect on outward GlyR currents of mutating the extracellular conductance determinant Lys to Glu either in the α or the β subunits in these constrained stoichiometry GlyRs. Surprisingly, even when all the three β subunits carried the reverse charge mutation (α1βKE), no effect was seen on the outward slope conductance (Fig. 3A, 34.9 ± 0.9 pS, second column and Table 3). On the other hand, mutating the two α subunits (α1KEβ, Fig. 3A, third column) still produced a clear decrease in conductance (−27.3%, 24.0 ± 1.0 pS, p < 0.05). Combining the (ineffective) mutations in β with the mutations in α to express a double mutant receptor (α1KEβKE) produced a greater decrease in conductance (−54.4%, 16.4 ± 1.6 pS) than mutating the α subunit alone (p < 0.05).TABLE 3Outward slope conductance values for α1β Gly receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes as tandem subunits together with a free β subunit (α1_β+β) or as untethered subunits (α1:β, 1:40 injection ratio)Receptor type (tethered)Outward γnan is the number of patches.Receptor type (un-tethered)Outward γnan is the number of patches.α1β33.0 ± 2.05α1β35.3 ± 1.33α1K104Eβ24.0 ± 1.0bp < 0.001 compared to wild-type conductance (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test).3α1K104Eβ23.3 ± 0.6bp < 0.001 compared to wild-type conductance (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test).4α1βK127E34.9 ± 0.97α1βK127E34.7 ± 1.03α1K104EβK127E16.4 ± 1.6cp < 0.0001 compared to wild-type conductance (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test).6α1K104EβK127E15.9 ± 0.6bp < 0.001 compared to wild-type conductance (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test).3a n is the number of patches.b p < 0.001 compared to wild-type conductance (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test).c p < 0.0001 compared to wild-type conductance (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test). Open table in a new tab Thus, charge reversal in the extracellular domain of the β subunit does not change conductance in the heteromeric α1β receptor, even when β subunits are present in higher number than α subunits. Mutations in the β subunit only have a detectable effect when the conductance has already been reduced by mutating the α subunit. As artifacts with tandem subunits have been described for other members of the nicotinic superfamily (19Groot-Kormelink P.J. Broadbent S.D. Boorman J.P. Sivilotti L.G. J. Gen.

Sci. 2004; 25: 499-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we measured, for comparison, the conductance of heteromeric receptors expressed in oocytes from un-tethered α1 and β subunits, both wild type and mutant. We found that the effects of mutations were identical to those observed in receptors constrained to have a 2α:3β stoichiometry in oocytes (Fig. 3, C and D, Table 3). To better explore whether the subunit copy number influences the effects of the conductance mutation in the same heterologous system, we tried to express a pure 3α:2β receptor population by injecting in oocytes the α1_β tandem together with an α1 subunit at 40:1 ratio. Robust whole-cell currents were recorded (supplemental Fig. S1), but patches from these oocytes contained exclusively α1 homomeric channels, as indicated by their conductance (6 patches from 2 different batches of oocytes). Because of that, we tried an alternative strategy and constructed β_α1 tandems, linked by (AGS)6/8/10 repeats. Unfortunately, and in contrast with the α1_β constructs described above and in Ref. 11Grudzinska J. Schemm R. Haeger S. Nicke A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Laube B. Neuron. 2005; 45: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, all these β_α1 tandems displayed robust whole-cell current when injected alone in oocytes, making them useless for our purposes (see supplemental Fig. S1). In Gly and GABAA channels, single-channel conductance increases with increasing chloride concentration above the physiological 150 mm chloride concentration used in our experiments so far, reaching a maximum above 300 mm (12Bormann J. Hamill O.P. Sakmann B. J. Physiol. 1987; 385: 243-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the effect of charge reversals in the different subunits is affected if single-channel conductance is increased by using a chloride concentration that is close to saturating (300 mm). We therefore recorded outward currents from all"

In biologically induced mineralization, crystals are generally produced by a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism.

Establishing the presence of such a diversity of these phosphorylated proteins and the consequent potential array of phosphorylated polypeptides that could be derived by their post-translational modification may be significant to understanding their functional activity. Although relatively little attention has been directed toward understanding the effects of phosphorylation of these ECM proteins, it is reasonable to speculate that the nature and extent of their phosphorylation could confer specificity in their function and specific behaviors between tissues. For example, the OPN gene is expressed and translated in many non-mineralizing tissues with very low levels of phosphorylation, compared with the extent of OPN phosphorylation in bone (12Nomura S. Wills A.J. Edwards D.R. Heath J.K. Hogan B.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 13Mark M.P. Prince C.W. Gay S. Austin R.L. Butler W.T. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, the extent of OPN phosphorylation in bone (14Salih E. Zhou H.Y. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16897-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) is less than that of OPN in milk (15Lasa M. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These differences suggest that the phosphorylation state can confer functional specificity to these proteins, and strongly implies the existence of tissue-specific kinases. One of our goals is to understand how post-translational phosphorylation of non-collagenous ECM proteins potentiates their contribution to the formation of mineral matrices. Second, we are interested in whether the protein kinases responsible for phosphorylating these proteins are unique to cells dedicated to producing mineralized tissues or whether they could be present in non-mineralizing tissues as well. Our proposed model system focuses on the highly phosphorylated ECM protein known as PP, due to its high content of phosphate and possession of one of the highest affinities for Ca2+ of the matrix proteins studied to date (16Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Veis A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1987; 40: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, PP is overexpressed in NIH3T3, a cell that does not normally mineralize its matrix, and in MC3T3-E1, an osteoblastic cell that is capable of forming a mineralized matrix. We further assess the phosphorylation status of secreted PP harvested from the extracellular matrix, and thereby speculate on its role in biomineralization in these distinct extracellular environments. To clone the murine Pp gene into the glutathione S-transferase (GST) Gene Fusion System, the pGEX-4T-3 vector was used. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of exon 5, using the dentin sialophosphoprotein genomic DNA as a template, was performed. A PCR was carried out using gene-specific primers containing the DNA sequence for SalI and XbaI restriction enzymes added to the 5′ end of each primer. The forward primer with the SalI restriction site added to the 5′ end was: 5′-CTAATGTCGACATGGAGAGTGGCAGCCGTGGAGA-3′. The reverse primer with XbaI added to the 5′ end was 5′-GCATTCTAGATTAAAGCACCCGCCATTCAAATCG-3′. (Double underline signifies the gene-specific sequence, whereas the single underline represents the restriction enzyme and 5 random bases at the 5′ end.) The amplified 1.7-kb fragment of exon 5 was digested using SalI and XbaI restriction enzymes and subcloned into the GST vector. The Pp insert was confirmed using agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. The newly generated clone was called pGEX-4T-3-PP. The Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare GST Gene Fusion System is an integrated system for the expression, purification, and detection of fusion proteins produced in Escherichia coli. The construct pGEX-4T-3-PP was used to transform the bacterial host BL21. Ampicillin-resistant colonies containing the insert were grown in Luria broth (LB) containing ampicillin for 4 h at 30 °C. To induce expression of the fusion protein, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was then added at 1 mm, and incubation was carried out for another 3 h. The bacterial lysate was cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation and the cleared lysate was applied directly to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). After the fusion proteins were bound to the matrix, it was washed with 1× PBS to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Bound GST fusion proteins were then released with thrombin. (Cleavage of the bound fusion protein eliminates the extra step of separating the released protein from GST, because the GST moiety remains bound to the matrix, whereas the cloned protein is eluted using wash buffer.) To remove thrombin from the eluates, p-aminobenzamidine immobilized on Sepharose 4 Fast Flow matrix was used (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). The purified protein was electrophoresed on polyacrylamide to verify the molecular mass, and an aliquot was used for amino acid composition and sequencing as previously reported (17Jadlowiec J.

A phosphophoryn gene fragment (exon 5) was subcloned into the pShooter/ER vector (Invitrogen) using PCR. The primers used were the same as described above to amplify the expected 1.7-kb fragment of exon 5. The fragment was digested using SalI and XbaI restriction enzymes and subcloned into the pShooter/ER vector. The pShooter/ER vector employs an N-terminal signal peptide targeting sequence that results in the recombinant protein product being directed to the endoplasmic reticulum in mammalian cells. The pShooter-ER-PP construct was transfected into MC3T3-E1 and NIH3T3 cell lines using a FuGENE 6 transfection kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Following DNA transfection, neomycin (G418) was used to select and maintain stable eukaryotic cell lines stably expressing the p-Shooter-ER-PP construct. A range of 800 μg/ml to 1 mg/ml of G418 was used for selection of neomycin resistance (a control of non-transfected cells was also used). The transfected cells were plated in 150-cm2 flasks at a high dilution. Sterile glass rings were used to select surviving colonies. The isolated colonies were trypsinized and transferred to a new flask where the cells were allowed to expand and then screened for gene and protein expression. Over 6 weeks, we isolated 10 and 12 colonies of NIH3T3 and MC3T3-E1, respectively, stably transfected with the Pp gene. Transfected NIH3T3 and MC3T3-E1 mRNA was extracted using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). Extraction was carried out according to the protocol with addition of RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) treatment for 15 min, followed by a low salt buffer wash, just prior to mRNA elution from a MicroSpin column (GE Healthcare). The freshly isolated mRNA was used to carry out RT-PCR using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega). The primers used for the PCR were: forward 5′-GAG TGA GGA CAA GGA CGA ATC T-3′ and reverse 5′-ATC TAA TCA TCA CTG GTT GAG TG-3′. These primers should yield a 1.3-kb PCR fragment. NIH3T3-PP cells were cultured for 7 and 10 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 50 mm l-ascorbic acid, and 4 mm inorganic phosphate (Sigma). Medium and cells/matrix were collected separately at days 7 and 10. The proteins were precipitated from the medium using trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The remaining cells (with associated extracellular matrix) were lysed in a RIPA buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The RIPA buffer consists of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm 1-methionine, 2 mm 1-cysteine, 0.3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The precipitated proteins from the medium and cell/matrix were either further purified by column chromatography, or blotted on nitrocellulose paper using dot blot or Western blot techniques using both the anti-PP antibody (generated in our laboratory) and the anti-dentin matrix protein 2 (DMP2) antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Arthur Veis, Northwestern University). This antibody has been previously shown to have cross-reactivity with phosphophoryn due to the common content of (DSS)n repeats (19Veis A. Wei K. Sfeir C. George A. Malone J. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20He G. Ramachandran A. Dahl T. George S. Schultz D. Cookson D. Veis A. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33109-33114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we used our recombinant PP as well as recombinant DMP2, provided by Dr. Veis. BSA was used as a negative control. Cells were grown for 7 and 10 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 50 mm l-ascorbic acid, and 4 mm inorganic phosphate (Sigma). This phosphate concentration does not cause dystrophic calcification as shown in other culture studies (21Magne D. Bluteau G. Lopez-Cazaux S. Weiss P. Pilet P. Ritchie H.H. Daculsi G. Guicheux J. Connect. Tissue Res. 2004; 45: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Pourmand E.P. Binderman I. Doty S.B. Kudryashov V. Boskey A.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). At days 7 and 10, von Kossa staining for phosphate deposition was performed as follows: cell culture layers were washed twice with PBS, fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin for 10 min, and serially dehydrated in 70, 95, and 100% ethanol, two times each, and air dried. The plates were then rehydrated from 100 to 95 to 80% ethanol to H2O. The water was removed, a 2% silver nitrate solution was added, and the plate was exposed to sunlight for 20 min, after which the plate was rinsed with water. Sodium thiosulfate (5%) was added for 3 min, the plates were then rinsed in water, and the cells were counterstained with nuclear fast red for 5 min. The plates were washed with H2O, then twice with 95% ethanol and twice with 100% ethanol, and dried for image analysis. To estimate the amount of calcium accumulated in the cultures, cells were cultured as described before. Cell layers were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h and rinsed with double distilled H2O. Cells were stained with 40 mm alizarin red-S, pH 4.2, for 10 min with gentle agitation. Cell layers were rinsed five times with ddH2O and then rinsed for 15 min with 1× PBS and gentle agitation. Alizarin red was extracted from fixed cell layers by treatment with 500 μl of 10% cetylpyridinium chloride for 20 min with gentle agitation. Absorbance of extracted alizarin red in cetylpyridinium chloride solution was measured at 570 nm. The amount of calcium (in μg) was determined according to an alizarin red-Ca2+ standard curve and normalized to total protein of the cell lysate. The relative phosphate content of the phosphoproteins was determined using Pro-Q® Diamond (Invitrogen) phosphoprotein gel stain, which selectively stains phosphoproteins in polyacrylamide gels. This proprietary fluorescent stain allows direct, in-gel detection of phosphate groups attached to tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues. The SDS-PAGE gels were stained according to the manufacturer's recommendation. In summary, the gels were fixed and stained with phosphoprotein gel stain equivalent to 10 times the volume of the gel with gentle agitation in the dark for 60–90 min. The gel was then destained in 80–100 ml of destaining solution with gentle agitation for 30 min at room temperature. The gel was then washed twice with ultrapure water at room temperature for 5 min per wash and imaged. The specimens from tissue culture were washed three times with pH 8 ammoniated water, air dried, and then lyophilized. Aliquots (∼1.0 mg) were hydrolyzed in 1 n HCl and diluted 1:1 to 1:10 depending on the initial calcium concentration observed. Calcium concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry as described by Willis et al. (23Willis J.B. Spectrochim. Acta. 1960; 16: 259-272Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). An equivalent volume was assayed for phosphate concentration (24Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Calcium/phosphate ion molar ratios were calculated and compared with a hydroxyapatite standard included in all assays. The HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare) was used to couple the anti-PP antibody according to the manufacturer's recommendation. In summary, the antibody was first coupled to the column using a coupling buffer that consists of 0.2 m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8, washed to remove any uncoupled antibodies, and then deactivated to remove any excess active groups. PP purification was carried out using an affinity column pre-equilibrated with tissue culture medium. The isolated medium containing PP was loaded and washed. PP was eluted in a 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, solution. MC3T3-E1 and NIH3T3 cells were seeded on glass slides that were subsequently placed in 150 × 25-mm polystyrene tissue culture dishes. The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and kept in a humidified incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) until they reached ∼80% confluence. Once the cells reached 80% confluence, a 4 mm inorganic phosphate (prepared from 0.5 m NaH2PO4·2(H2O) stock solution was used) solution was created in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2.5% Hepes. Day 1 was defined as the day of inorganic phosphate supplementation to the cell culture. At day 15, the medium was aspirated and culture dishes were washed with ammonia water (1000:1 deionized water to 5% ammonium hydroxide solution) to remove any unincorporated salts that might be present. The culture dishes were then air dried. The glass slides were removed from the culture dishes for analysis. Samples were analyzed using the Philips x-ray diffractometer (Philips X'pert Pro diffractometer with X'Celerator) employing CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) from the 2θ angle of 21 to 80 degrees with time per step being 100 s, and step size (2θ) being 0.033 degrees. Some of the mineralized samples were also scanned from 2θ angles of 2 to 90 degrees to detect the presence of inorganic calcium phosphates, particularly, octacalcium phosphates that could also likely form under the conditions used for this study. Recombinant PP (rPP) at concentrations from 2.5 to 100 ng/ml was assessed for its ability to initiate the formation and growth of the mineral phase, hydroxyapatite (HA). De novo HA formation and growth were monitored in the dynamic collagen gel HA growth system (25Boskey A.L. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 91: 1628-1633Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In brief, in this double diffusion system, Ca2+ and HPO42- (Pi) ions circulate at room temperature diffusing into opposite ends of a 6-cm long 10% gelatin (Bloom 275, Fisher Chemical) gel. At a site 3.4 cm from the P entrance point, the gel includes a 100-μl band containing the proteins to be tested. At 4.5 days, the CaxPi mm product in the absence of protein at this site is 5.5 mm2. For de novo formation and growth studies, calcium and phosphate ions accumulation in the precipitant band containing 0.15 m Tris buffer (control) was compared with experimental gels with 0.01–100 μg/ml of recombinant protein in Tris buffer. For all experiments, identical “single diffusion” gels, into which only calcium and phosphate ions diffused, served as additional controls to correct for ion accretion due only to diffusion or to binding of the ion to the matrix protein. Control, non-phosphorylated recombinant double and single diffusion gels were run parallel to each recombinant experiment; comparisons were also made to these controls to avoid errors inherent in experiments that might have undergone variations in temperature, time span, solution flow, or reservoir concentrations. At 4.5 days, the gels were removed from the apparatus and either the precipitant band was cut out for mineral analysis (x-ray diffraction or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)) or the entire gel was cut into slices (0.30 ml volume), and the calcium (23Willis J.B. Spectrochim. Acta. 1960; 16: 259-272Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and phosphate ion (24Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) content of each slice was then determined by atomic absorption and spectrophotometric analyses, respectively. The calcium/phosphate ion analyses were performed following hydrolysis (18 h, 110 °C) of the gel in 4 n HCl. The calcium and phosphate ion contents of the precipitant band were calculated by subtracting the content of the comparable slice in the single diffusion gels from that of the precipitant band. The calcium and phosphate ion contents of adjacent bands were also compared, and used to verify that the gels had been sliced equivalently. All data were compared with the mineral content of the protein-free gels using the Student's t test. Each data point represents 3–12 gel analyses. To compare the same protein made without post-translational modification (bacterially), or with post-translational modification (expressed in mammalian cells), we cloned the PP cDNA insert into both pGEX-4T-3 and pShooter expression vectors. The new constructs expressing PP were called: pGEX-4T-3-PP and pShooter-ER-PP. The construct pGEX-4T-3-PP was used to transform the bacterial host BL21, which in turn was induced to express PP. The purified protein, following removal of GST, was electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels to verify a molecular mass of ∼55 kDa (17Jadlowiec J. Koch H. Zhang X. Campbell P.G. Seyedain M. Sfeir C. J.

As expected, the acidic nature of the protein resulted in staining with Stains-All (28Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. Jorgensen A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). Dot blot analysis with an anti-PP antibody (Fig. 1A), verified that the recombinant protein is indeed rPP. These data were strengthened through a second dot blot using a polyclonal anti-DMP2 antibody (Fig. 1B). This antibody (a gift from Dr. A. Veis) has been previously shown to have cross-reactivity with phosphophoryn due to the common content of (DSS)n repeats (19Veis A. Wei K. Sfeir C. George A. Malone J. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20He G. Ramachandran A. Dahl T. George S. Schultz D. Cookson D. Veis A. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33109-33114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We confirmed the correct size and migration of the recombinant PP through Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, amino acid composition analysis of an aliquot of the preparation showed a protein rich in aspartic acid and serine, with the N-terminal end sequence corresponding to phosphophoryn (data not shown). The pShooter-ER-PP construct was transfected into MC3T3-E1 and NIH3T3 cells. To determine that the NIH3T3 and MC3T3-E1 cells were stably transfected, we performed PCR using freshly isolated mRNA and forward and reverse primers specific to PP, which yielded a 1.3-kb PCR product (expected size using the specified primers). As shown in Fig. 2, most of the NIH3T3 isolated G418-resistant cell colonies produced the PP transcript as demonstrated by the presence of the 1.3-kb PCR band, whereas the control (non-transfected NIH3T3 cells) did not show the presence of the PP transcript. We also obtained similar results from MC3T3-E1 cells (data not shown). To establish that the PP produced in our stable transfectants was actually finding its way to the extracellular matrix, we examined whether PP was detectable in the media of transfected cells. The pShooter-ER-PP construct relies on a peptide at the N-terminal end of PP to direct newly translated protein to the ER and Golgi where its post-translational modification takes place (29Sfeir C. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Sfeir C. Veis A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, A–C, the stably transfected NIH3T3 and MC3T3-E1 cells secreted PP; the protein was readily precipitated from the medium of NIH3T3-PP and MC3T3-E1-PP and detectable by dot blot (Fig. 3A) and Western blot (Fig. 3, B–D) using anti-PP antibody. No phosphophoryn expression was detected in non-transfected cells (control). The stably transfected cells secreted ∼0.5 μg of phosphophoryn/ml of medium. Of particular interest in this study was to see whether expressing phosphophoryn in cells that do not normally produce a mineralized matrix would alone induce these cells to form a mineralized matrix. In other words, would PP expression be sufficient to establish the necessary framework for establishing a mineralized ECM? Cells grown for 4, 7, and 10 days showed the presence of mineral when PP was present (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Phosphate (von Kossa) staining at days 7 and 10 showed negligible staining of the mineral deposits in control NIH3T3 cells (non-transfected) (Fig. 4A), whereas NIH3T3 cells expressing PP showed extensive mineral deposition (Fig. 4B). Higher magnification images (Fig. 4, E and F) verified these findings. Fig. 5A shows the presence of calcium (positive alizarin red stain) at days 4 and 10 (day 7 not shown), whereas the control cultures show only background alizarin red staining. Spectrophotometric quantification of alizarin red staining (Fig. 5B) demonstrated a 2-fold increase at day 4 and a 4-fold increase at day 10 in the staining levels, whereas the control cells remained at background levels. The differences between experimental and control were statistically significant (p < 0.001) based on analysis of variance and Fisher's Least Significant Difference post hoc test (Protected t test).FIGURE 5Assessment of calcium deposition by cells expressing PP.

https://openalex.org/W2018511027,"The ATPase activity of chloroplast and bacterial F(1)-ATPase is strongly inhibited by both the endogenous inhibitor ε and tightly bound ADP. Although the physiological significance of these inhibitory mechanisms is not very well known for the membrane-bound F(0)F(1), these are very likely to be important in avoiding the futile ATP hydrolysis reaction and ensuring efficient ATP synthesis in vivo. In a previous study using the α(3)β(3)γ complex of F(1) obtained from the thermophilic cyanobacteria, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, we succeeded in determining the discrete stop position, ∼80° forward from the pause position for ATP binding, caused by ε-induced inhibition (ε-inhibition) during γ rotation (Konno, H., Murakami-Fuse, T., Fujii, F., Koyama, F., Ueoka-Nakanishi, H., Pack, C. G., Kinjo, M., and Hisabori, T. (2006) EMBO J. 25, 4596-4604). Because γ in ADP-inhibited F(1) also pauses at the same position, ADP-induced inhibition (ADP-inhibition) was assumed to be linked to ε-inhibition. However, ADP-inhibition and ε-inhibition should be independent phenomena from each other because the ATPase core complex, α(3)β(3)γ, also lapses into the ADP-inhibition state. By way of thorough biophysical and biochemical analyses, we determined that the ε subunit inhibition mechanism does not directly correlate with ADP-inhibition. We suggest here that the cyanobacterial ATP synthase ε subunit carries out an important regulatory role in acting as an independent ""braking system"" for the physiologically unfavorable ATP hydrolysis reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1994699932,"AMPA receptors mediate fast excitatory transmission in the brain. Neuronal AMPA receptors comprise GluA pore-forming principal subunits and can associate with multiple modulatory components, including transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) and CNIHs (cornichons). AMPA receptor potentiators and non-competitive antagonists represent potential targets for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies showed that the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-53655 displaces binding of a potentiator from brain receptors but not from recombinant GluA subunits. Here, we asked whether AMPA receptor modulatory subunits might resolve this discrepancy. We find that the cerebellar TARP, stargazin (γ-2), enhances the binding affinity of the AMPA receptor potentiator [3H]-LY450295 and confers sensitivity to displacement by non-competitive antagonists. In cerebellar membranes from stargazer mice, [3H]-LY450295 binding is reduced and relatively resistant to displacement by non-competitive antagonists. Coexpression of AMPA receptors with CNIH-2, which is expressed in the hippocampus and at low levels in the cerebellar Purkinje neurons, confers partial sensitivity of [3H]-LY450295 potentiator binding to displacement by non-competitive antagonists. Autoradiography of [3H]-LY450295 binding to stargazer and γ-8-deficient mouse brain sections, demonstrates that TARPs regulate the pharmacology of allosteric AMPA potentiators and antagonists in the cerebellum and hippocampus, respectively.

Zukin R.S. Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 126-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Accordingly, numerous pharmacological efforts have sought either to promote AMPA receptor function with potentiators or to block channel function with antagonists. AMPA receptor potentiators enhance channel permeation by either slowing deactivation (channel closure following glutamate removal) or blunting desensitization (channel closure in the continued presence of glutamate) (22Yamada K.A. Tang C.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3904-3915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AMPA potentiators can enhance synaptic transmission and thereby promote growth factor release and neurogenesis (23Bai F. Bergeron M. Nelson D.L. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Lauterborn J.C. Lynch G. Vanderklish P. Arai A. Gall C.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tang C.M. Shi Q.Y. Katchman A. Lynch G. Science. 1991; 254: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Preclinically, AMPA potentiators have shown promising activity in models of depression (26Arai A.C. Kessler M. Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 583-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), cognitive impairment (27Staubli U. Rogers G. Lynch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and Parkinson disease (28O'Neill M.J. Murray T.K. Clay M.P. Lindstrom T. Yang C.R. Nisenbaum E.S. CNS Drug. Rev. 2005; 11: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). AMPA receptor antagonists that blunt synaptic transmission have been pursued as therapeutics for epilepsy, neurodegeneration, and neuropathic pain. Multiple classes of AMPA receptor antagonists have been identified. Antagonists, such as 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, compete with glutamate at the agonist binding site and occlude channel opening (29Honoré T. Davies S.N. Drejer J. Fletcher E.J. Jacobsen P. Lodge D. Nielsen F.E. Science. 1988; 241: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Noncompetitive antagonists, such as GYKI-53655, reportedly interact at an alternative site to allosteric potentiators and inhibit channel gating downstream of glutamate binding (30Donevan S.D. Rogawski M.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 51-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 31Balannik V. Menniti F.S. Paternain A.V. Lerma J. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2005; 48: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TARPs have complex interactions with AMPA receptor modulator drugs. TARPs convert certain competitive antagonists, including 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, into partial agonists (32Menuz K. Stroud R.M. Nicoll R.A. Hays F.A. Science. 2007; 318: 815-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). By increasing glutamate affinity, TARPs also blunt effects of competitive antagonists (33Cokić B. Stein V. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 54: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By contrast, TARP γ-2 increases the affinity of certain non-competitive antagonists, such as GYKI-53655 (33Cokić B. Stein V. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 54: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for channel block by non-competitive antagonists remains unclear (31Balannik V. Menniti F.S. Paternain A.V. Lerma J. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2005; 48: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and resolving this may provide insights for mechanisms that underlie channel gating. Interactions between AMPA receptors potentiators and antagonists have also yielded valuable clues regarding their mechanisms of action. The IC50 for GKYI-53655 is shifted 10-fold to right by cyclothiazide (34Zorumski C.F. Yamada K.A. Price M.T. Olney J.W. Neuron. 1993; 10: 61-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although initially interpreted as evidence for direct interaction between these sites, subsequent studies showed that cyclothiazide cannot displace a radiotracer from the GYKI-53655 binding site (9Priel A. Kolleker A. Ayalon G. Gillor M. Osten P. Stern-Bach Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2682-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Additional insight was provided by binding studies with [3H]-LY395153, which potently labels the potentiator site (35Lindén A.M. Yu H. Zarrinmayeh H. Wheeler W.J. Skolnick P. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, GYKI-53655 potently blocks binding of [3H]-LY395153 to AMPA receptors in brain membranes but does not affect binding to recombinant receptors (35Lindén A.M. Yu H. Zarrinmayeh H. Wheeler W.J. Skolnick P. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we addressed this discrepancy and discovered an unexpected role for AMPA receptor accessory proteins in functionally linking AMPA receptor potentiator and non-competitive antagonist binding sites. These results provide valuable insights for understanding and refining the neuropharmacology of AMPA receptors. All buffers and reagents were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich or Thermo Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). All cDNAs were human, except for rat iGluA2R, and were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 mammalian expression plasmids (Invitrogen). Compounds used in binding assays were synthesized at Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). For electrophysiology experiments, HEK293T cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 high glucose DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and split bi- or tri-weekly. HEK293T cells were plated onto 25-mm coverslips and were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocols (11814443001; Roche Applied Science). Experiments were conducted 48–72 h post-transfection. For radioligand binding experiments, HEK293E cells were maintained in suspension using a plate shaker (160 rpm) and incubated at 37 °C, 5–8% CO2, humidified with DMEM/F-12 medium (Hybritech, San Diego, CA) supplemented with HEPES (20 mm), Pluronic F-68 (0.075% w/v), tropolone (0.4 μg/ml), and nucellin/humulin (5 μg/ml). On the day of transfection, cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g and resuspended to 2 × 106 cells/ml. Using prewarmed media containing no supplements, the DNA-transfection reagent complex was made by adding 5 μg cDNA per ml with 10 μl of X-tremeGENE 1539 (Roche Applied Science), gently mixed for 60–90 min at room temperature, and then added to the cells. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Stargazer and wild-type mice were euthanized with CO2 and decapitated. Brains were dissected rapidly and homogenized using a Polytron in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Cells were pelleted and homogenized using a Polytron in 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 g to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Both tissue and cell homogenates were centrifuged again at 4 °C at 38,000 × g for 20 min. To remove endogenous glutamate, pellets were resuspended, washed with buffer, and centrifuged for 20 min. This process was repeated a total of four times. After the final wash, pellets were frozen on solid CO2 and stored at −80 °C. Membranes were incubated with 50 nm [3H]-LY450295 (ViTrax Radiochemicals, Placentia, CA) and other pharmaceutical agents as indicated for 2 h at 4 °C. Assay buffer comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 500 μm l-glutamate (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO). Nonspecific binding was determined by including 10 μm LY450108, a related AMPA receptor potentiator (36O'Neill M.J. Witkin J.M. Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 603-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All binding was terminated by rapid filtration using a TOMTEC 96-well cell harvester (Hamden, CT) through GF/A filters presoaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and air-dried overnight. The dried filters were placed on PerkinElmer Life Sciences MeltiLex A melt-on scintillator sheets, and the radioactivity was counted using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Wallac 1205 Betaplate counter (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). For binding studies, homomeric GluA transfections were used to ensure a uniform receptor composition. GluA2 was selected for binding studies due to its inclusion in most hippocampal (GluA1/GluA2 heteromeric) and cerebellar neuronal (GluA2/GluA3 and GluA2/GluA4 heteromeric) AMPA receptors (37Geiger J.R. Melcher T. Koh D.S. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Jonas P. Monyer H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). In some experiments, experimental variability caused binding to exceed 100% of control. Agonist-evoked currents were recorded from transfected HEK293T cells as described (38Kato A.S. Siuda E.R. Nisenbaum E.S. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 2008; 59: 986-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recordings were made using thick-walled borosilicate glass electrodes (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) pulled and fire-polished to a resistance of 2–5 megohms. All cells were voltage-clamped at −80 mV; data were low pass-filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using Axoclamp 200B and Axopatch software and hardware (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For each experiment, the transfected HEK293T cells were maintained in external solution containing the following: 117 mm TEA, 13 mm NaCl, 5 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm CsCl, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4). The intracellular electrode solution contained the following: 160 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4 mm MgCl2, 40.0 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 12 mm phosphocreatine, 2.0 mm Na2-ATP (pH 7.2) adjusted with H2SO4. Osmolarity was adjusted to 290 ± 5 mosm. Transfected HEK293T cells were lifted and perfused with a 16-barrel glass capillary pipette placed 100–200 μm from the cell (VitroCom, Mountain Lakes, NJ). Solutions were switched by sliding the pipette array with a solution exchange rate of <20 ms. Glutamate (1 mm), LY450295 (10 μm), and GYKI-53655 (10 μm) were applied where indicated. Because of the low conductance from homomeric GluA2 receptors used in binding studies (39Boulter J. Hollmann M. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Hartley M. Deneris E. Maron C. Heinemann S. Science. 1990; 249: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 40Swanson G.T. Kamboj S.K. Cull-Candy S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 58-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we transfected HEK293T cells with GluA1 + GluA2 in the presence or absence of γ-2. GluA2 incorporation into heteromeric complexes with GluA1 was confirmed via a linear I-V curve from −80 to + 80 mV. Preincubation of the potentiator, empirically determined to maximize intercell potentiation reliability, was for a period of 1 min followed by 30-s pulses of agonist in the presence of compounds. Sagittal brain sections were cut at 12 μm, thaw mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, and stored at −80 °C. Sections were incubated for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 50 nm [3H]-LY450295, 500 μm l-glutamate, and other agents as indicated. Sections were rinsed with 50 mm ice-cold Tris-HCl for 10 min, dried, and exposed to a Fujifilm Imaging Plate for 15 days. Radioligand binding studies were analyzed using a Microsoft ExcelTM workbook and were graphed using GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA). The electrophysiology data are represented as mean ± S.E. and were the result of at least three independent experiments. Analyses involving three or more data sets were performed with a one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey Kramer post hoc analysis using GraphPad Prism software. Analyses involving two data sets were performed with an uncorrected Student's t test or with a Student's t test with a Welsh correction, only if the variances were statistically different. Percent inhibition was calculated as,Inhibition(%)=100−[(lGlu-SS in LY50295+GYKI−53655/lGlu-SS in LY450295)×100](Eq.1) where IGlu-SS is the glutamate-evoked steady state current in LY450295 and GYKI-53655 or just LY450295. Significance was set as a p value of <0.05. B0 refers to the specific potentiator binding, which occurs in the absence of any added antagonist. Previous studies characterized binding of AMPA receptor potentiator [3H]-LY395153 both to brain membranes and to recombinantly expressed GluA subunits (35Lindén A.M. Yu H. Zarrinmayeh H. Wheeler W.J. Skolnick P. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Curiously, the non-competitive antagonist, GYKI-53655 potently displaced [3H]-LY395153 binding to cerebrocortical membranes but did not displace binding from transfected GluA4 membranes (35Lindén A.M. Yu H. Zarrinmayeh H. Wheeler W.J. Skolnick P. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We first asked whether this discrepancy was particular to a specific brain region or GluA subunit. Using GluA2 because of its predominant incorporation into cerebellar neuronal AMPA receptors (37Geiger J.R. Melcher T. Koh D.S. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Jonas P. Monyer H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), we observed that GYKI-53655 readily displaced the AMPA potentiator, [3H]-LY450295, from cerebellar membranes but did not displace [3H]-LY450295 binding from transfected GluA2 membranes (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a structurally distinct non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, CP-465,022, showed a similar selectivity for displacement of potentiator only from native tissues (Fig. 1B). Because GluA2 is incorporated into AMPA receptors across multiple brain regions, we focused on this GluA subunit (37Geiger J.R. Melcher T. Koh D.S. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Jonas P. Monyer H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Numerous studies show that TARPs control neuronal AMPA receptor gating and pharmacology (4Nicoll R.A. Tomita S. Bredt D.S. Science. 2006; 311: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 41Vandenberghe W. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neuroscience. 2009; 162: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In particular, stargazin (γ-2) slows AMPA receptor desensitization, augments steady state currents and increases the affinity for both the full agonist glutamate and the partial agonist kainate (7Yamazaki M. Ohno-Shosaku T. Fukaya M. Kano M. Watanabe M. Sakimura K. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 50: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 9Priel A. Kolleker A. Ayalon G. Gillor M. Osten P. Stern-Bach Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2682-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Turetsky D. Garringer E. Patneau D.K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7438-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We asked whether γ-2 might also modulate [3H]-LY450295 binding. GluA2 alone produced receptors that bound [3H]-LY450295 with a Kd of 81 ± 13 nm and a Bmax of 1434 ± 74 fmol/mg protein. Nonlinear regression analysis of the specific binding revealed a single saturable, high affinity site for LY450295. Co-expression of γ-2 increased both [3H]-LY450295 binding affinity (Kd = 19 ± 2.5 nm) and total binding (Bmax = 2101 ± 67 fmol/mg protein, Fig. 2A). Immunoblotting showed that the increase in total binding with γ-2 occurred despite a decrease in the amount of GluA2 expressed (Fig. 2B), which suggests that γ-2 may promote folding or stability of functional GluA2 to increase potentiator binding (46Vandenberghe W. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Displacement of [3H]-LY450295 with unlabeled LY450295 revealed a similar γ-2-mediated increase in LY450295 binding affinity (GluA2 alone IC50 = 109.5 nm versus GluA2 + γ-2 IC50 = 29.5 nm, Fig. 2C). The stargazin-mediated enhancement in potentiator affinity is paralleled by the increase seen previously in native cortical tissue versus recombinantly expressed AMPA receptors (35Lindén A.M. Yu H. Zarrinmayeh H. Wheeler W.J. Skolnick P. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We next asked whether γ-2 co-transfection might also confer sensitivity of [3H]-LY450295 binding to GYKI-53655. Strikingly, GYKI-53655 readily displaced [3H]-LY450295 from GluA2 + γ-2 membranes similar to wild-type cerebellar membranes (Fig. 3). Also, the structurally distinct AMPA receptor antagonist, CP-465,022, showed a similar selectivity for displacement of radiolabeled potentiator binding from GluA2 + γ-2-containing membranes (Fig. 3). Differential displacement by GYKI-53655 of [3H]-LY450295 in GluA2 (no displacement, Figs. 1A and 3) and GluA2 co-transfected with γ-2 membranes (∼70% displacement, Figs. 1A and 3) could indicate that LY450295 makes γ-2-lacking AMPA receptors insensitive to functional antagonism by GYKI-53655. To assess this, we measured GYKI-53655-mediated inhibition of glutamate-evoked currents. As reported previously, co-transfection of γ-2 dramatically increased glutamate-evoked currents (Fig. 4, A–C). LY450295 potentiated the glutamate-evoked currents from GluA1/GluA2 and GluA1/GluA2 + γ-2 heteromeric receptors (Fig. 4, A–C). Importantly, GYKI-53655 inhibited the LY450295-potentiated glutamate-evoked steady state currents from both γ-2-lacking and γ-2-containing AMPA receptors (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). Even though GYKI-53655 does not affect LY450295 binding to GluA2 receptors, these data show that GYKI-53655 regulates γ-2-lacking receptors and implies that the binding sites for GYKI-53655 and LY450295 are distinct. Stargazer mice, which lack functional γ-2, display absence epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia and exhibit dramatically reduced synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated responses in cerebellar granule cells (5Hashimoto K. Fukaya M. Qiao X. Sakimura K. Watanabe M. Kano M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6027-6036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J.

Epilepsy Res. 1990; 7: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To further assess the importance of γ-2, we characterized binding of [3H]-LY450295 and found that cerebellar membranes from stargazer mice bound less [3H]-LY450295 than did wild-type membranes (wild-type Bmax ∼ 1960 fmol/mg protein versus stargazer Bmax ∼ 1470 fmol/mg protein; Fig. 5A). Furthermore, [3H]-LY450295 had decreased binding affinity in stargazer as compared with wild-type cerebellar membranes (∼32 nm in wild-type versus ∼60 nm in stargazer, Fig. 5A). Importantly, the non-competitive antagonists, GYKI-53655 and CP-465,022, only weakly displaced [3H]-LY450295 binding from stargazer cerebellar membranes (Fig. 5, B and C). These data resolve the discrepancy between native and recombinant AMPA receptors for potentiator binding by establishing that γ-2 allosterically regulates AMPA receptor allosteric modulator pharmacology (35Lindén A.M. Yu H. Zarrinmayeh H. Wheeler W.J. Skolnick P. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recent proteomic analyses have identified several additional AMPA receptor accessory proteins that modulate channel kinetics and/or pharmacology (11Schwenk J. Harmel N. Zolles G. Bildl W. Kulik A.

In particular, CNIH (cornichon) proteins modulate surface trafficking of AMPA receptors and channel gating (11Schwenk J. Harmel N. Zolles G. Bildl W. Kulik A. Heimrich B. Chisaka O. Jonas P.

CNIH-2 is present in multiple brain regions with high levels of expression occurring in the hippocampus and low levels of expression in the cerebellum, particularly within the Purkinje neuron population (12Shi Y. Suh Y.H. Milstein A.D. Isozaki K. Schmid S.M. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16315-16319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Kato A.S. Gill M.B. Ho M.T.

We assessed the effects of CNIH-2 on [3H]-LY450295 binding. We observed a single saturable, high affinity site in HEK293E membranes transiently expressing GluA2 + CNIH-2. Similar to γ-2, we found that CNIH-2-increased total binding (Fig. 6A). However, unlike γ-2, CNIH-2 did not affect affinity for [3H]-LY450295 (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, GluA2 + CNIH-2 recombinant membranes exhibited partial displacement of [3H]-LY450295 binding by the non-competitive antagonists, GYKI-53655 and CP-465,022 (Fig. 6C). Thus, CNIH-2 can regulate AMPA receptor pharmacology in a manner similar to but not identical to TARPs. γ-2 is the predominant TARP subunit in the cerebellum, whereas γ-8 predominates in hippocampus (48Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We used autoradiography to visualize [3H]-LY450295 binding throughout the brain. Sagittal sections were incubated with ∼50 nm [3H]-LY450295, and co-application of unlabeled LY450108 served as a measure of non-specific binding (Fig. 7, A and D). In wild-type mice, [3H]-LY450295 binding was present in diverse brain regions with the highest levels o"
https://openalex.org/W2071576057,"Growth and remodeling of lymphatic vasculature occur during development and during various pathologic states. A major stimulus for this process is the unique lymphatic vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C). Other endothelial growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) or VEGF-A, may also contribute. Heparan sulfate is a linear sulfated polysaccharide that facilitates binding and action of some vascular growth factors such as FGF-2 and VEGF-A. However, a direct role for heparan sulfate in lymphatic endothelial growth and sprouting responses, including those mediated by VEGF-C, remains to be examined. We demonstrate that VEGF-C binds to heparan sulfate purified from primary lymphatic endothelia, and activation of lymphatic endothelial Erk1/2 in response to VEGF-C is reduced by interference with heparin or pretreatment of cells with heparinase, which destroys heparan sulfate. Such treatment also inhibited phosphorylation of the major VEGF-C receptor VEGFR-3 upon VEGF-C stimulation. Silencing lymphatic heparan sulfate chain biosynthesis inhibited VEGF-C-mediated Erk1/2 activation and abrogated VEGFR-3 receptor-dependent binding of VEGF-C to the lymphatic endothelial surface. These findings prompted targeting of lymphatic N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 (Ndst1), a major sulfate-modifying heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzyme. VEGF-C-mediated Erk1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited in Ndst1-silenced lymphatic endothelia, and scratch-assay responses to VEGF-C and FGF-2 were reduced in Ndst1-deficient cells. In addition, lymphatic Ndst1 deficiency abrogated cell-based growth and proliferation responses to VEGF-C. In other studies, lymphatic endothelia cultured ex vivo from Ndst1 gene-targeted mice demonstrated reduced VEGF-C- and FGF-2-mediated sprouting in collagen matrix. Lymphatic heparan sulfate may represent a novel molecular target for therapeutic intervention."

CEP patients carrying this hotspot mutation develop a severe phenotype of the disease, including reduced life expectancy. Here, we have investigated the molecular basis for the functional deficit in the mutant enzyme both in vitro and in cellular systems. We show that a Cys in position 73 is not essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme but its mutation to Arg speeds up the process of irreversible unfolding and aggregation. In the mammalian cell milieu, the mutant protein levels decrease to below the detection limit, whereas wild type UROIIIS can be detected easily. The disparate response is not produced by differences at the level of transcription, and the results with cultured cells and in vitro are consistent with a model where the protein becomes very unstable upon mutation and triggers a degradation mechanism via the proteasome. Mutant protein levels can be restored upon cell treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132.

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), 4The abbreviations used are: CEP, congenital erythropoietic porphyria; UROIIIS, uroporphyrinogen III synthase; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; NPTII, neomycin phosphotransferase II; ARP, acidic ribosomal protein. or Gunther disease, is a rare autosomal disease caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROIIIS) (1Ged C.

Haematol. 2002; 117: 779-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). UROIIIS catalyzes the cyclization of the linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane to produce uroporphyrin III (3Battersby A.R.

Trans. 2002; 30: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Such condensation competes with the spontaneous degradation of the substrate to produce uroporphyrin I, which does not catabolize well (4Schubert H.L. Raux E. Matthews M.A. Phillips J.D. Wilson K.S. Hill C.P. Warren M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In CEP patients, lowered UROIIIS activity causes the accumulation of type I porphyrins in the bone marrow, teeth, stool, and urine as well as skin photosensitivity (2Desnick R.J. Astrin K.H. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 117: 779-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CEP patients also suffer from hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly, and they have red-colored urine. Because porphyrins mostly accumulate in the marrow, current treatment has focused on marrow suppression and bone marrow transplantation with an uneven degree of success (5Dupuis-Girod S. Akkari V. Ged C. Galambrun C. Kebaïli K. Deybach J.C. Claudy A. Geburher L. Philippe N. de Verneuil H. Bertrand Y. Eur. J. Pediatr. 2005; 164: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Tezcan I.

At the molecular level, the severity of the disease is dependent ultimately on the nature of the inborn error (7Fontanellas A. Bensidhoum M. Enriquez de Salamanca R. Moruno Tirado A. de Verneuil H.

Genetic analyses of >110 CEP patients have identified ∼25 missense mutations as well as four defects in the promoter region (10Frank J. Wang X. Lam H.M. Aita V.M. Jugert F.K. Goerz G. Merk H.F.

As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, the distinct mutations are repeated only occasionally within patients. One striking exception is C73R, present in more than one-third of all reported cases (10Frank J. Wang X. Lam H.M. Aita V.M. Jugert F.K. Goerz G. Merk H.F. Poh-Fitzpatrick M.B. Christiano A.M. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 225-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hotspot mutation has a drastic effect on UROIIIS enzyme functionality and results in the most severe phenotype in CEP patients (11Bishop D.F. Johansson A. Phelps R. Shady A.A. Ramirez M.C. Yasuda M. Caro A. Desnick R.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 78: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a first step to therapy, it is crucial to understand the mechanism by which the mutation induces the loss of functionality. Structural studies and modeled complexes indicate that Cys-73 is far from the enzyme-substrate interaction site, suggesting that it does not play a critical role in catalysis (12Mathews M.A. Schubert H.L. Whitby F.G. Alexander K.J. Schadick K. Bergonia H.A. Phillips J.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Cunha L. Kuti M. Bishop D.F. Mezei M. Zeng L.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8648-8655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, we have shown recently that, in vitro, purified recombinant human C73R-UROIIIS partially retains its catalytic activity (15Fortian A. Castaño D. Ortega G. Laín A. Pons M. Millet O. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutations can also reduce thermodynamic stability, and proteins that are mis- or unfolded are usually processed by cellular degradation pathways (16Knecht E. Aguado C. Cárcel J. Esteban I. Esteve J.M. Ghislat G. Moruno J.F. Vidal J.M. Sáez R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 2427-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, we have explored the relationship between enzyme activity and the stability of C73R-UROIIIS both in vitro and in cell cultures. Our results with pure protein show that the mutant protein is folded but undergoes a conformational change. The apparent enzyme activity decreases over time at a much faster rate than in wild type UROIIIS due to the premature unfolding of the molecule. In transfected cells, C73R-UROIIIS protein levels are depleted, but intracellular mRNA levels are not. Upon proteasome inhibition, mutant protein levels are restored, and the protein is proven to be functionally active. All media and reagents for tissue culture were purchased from Invitrogen. Human fibroblastoid M1 cells were grown in complete DMEM medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin). The murine hepatic MLP29 cell line was grown under the same culture conditions. When indicated, cells were cultured during 12 h in the presence of 10 μm MG132, 100 μm choloroquine, or 15 mm ammonium chloride, which were all from Sigma-Aldrich. Monoclonal antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: anti-Myc tag (clone 4A6) from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY), anti-neomycin phosphotransferase II (clone 4B4D1) from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), anti-Hsp90 (clone 68) from BD Biosciences, and anti-Hsp70 (clone BRM-22) and anti-alpha-tubulin (clone DM1A) from Sigma-Aldrich. HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was from GE Healthcare. All other reagents were of analytical grade and primarily acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. To generate mammalian expression plasmids coding human UROIIIS (wild type and C73R) fused to the Myc epitope, the complete open reading frames of UROIIIS were amplified by PCR from the bacterial plasmid pHTUROIIIS expressing wild type or C73R versions of human UROIIIS. The products were purified and used as templates for nested PCR, using primers designed to append an EcoRI site upstream of the Kozak sequence and to replace the translation termination site with a SalI site, followed by Myc-coding sequence, a stop codon, and a NotI site. The nested PCR product was gel-purified and cloned in the EcoRI-SalI sites of the pEGFP-C2 and pEGFP-N3 vectors (Takara Bio, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) for expression of GFP-tagged proteins, or in the EcoRI-NotI of the pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen) for expression of Myc-tagged proteins. All constructs were roughly verified by DNA sequencing. The human UROIIIS sequence fused to the Myc epitope also was obtained by PCR of plasmid DNA (pHTUROIIIS) containing wild type human UROIIIS, using the forward and reverse primers 5′-cttccatatgatggaacaaaagcttatttc-3′ and 5′-cgcggatcctcagcagcaaccatg-3′ and cloned into the pET16b bacterial vector using the BamH1 and Nde1 restriction sites. For stable transfection, both M1 and MLP29 cell lines were grown to 60–70% confluency. M1 cells were transfected with C- or N-terminal Myc-tagged UROIIIS-WT or UROIIIS-C73R-encoding plasmids and MLP29 cells with C- or N-terminal GFP-tagged UROIIIS-WT or UROIIIS-C73R-encoding plasmids by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany) and OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was changed to complete DMEM 5 h post-transfection and to complete DMEM containing 2 g/liter G418 24 h later. About 2 weeks later, clones of stably transfected cells were isolated and maintained in complete DMEM containing 2 mg/ml G418. The same stable cell line from each of the different WT and C73R versions of the UROIIIS protein was selected to perform this study. MLP29 stable cell lines carrying GFP-tagged proteins were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 2% (w/v) formaldehyde, washed twice with PBS, and mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) containing 0.7 mg/liter DAPI. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (27Falcón-Pérez J.M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was examined on a Leica TCS SP multiphoton confocal microscope, and images from different channels were acquired using the Leica Confocal Software. MLP29 cell lines stably expressing GFP-tagged UROIIIS-WT or UROIIIS-C73R proteins were cultured in 150-mm dishes, trypsinized using TRIPLE reagent (Invitrogen), washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and analyzed on a FACS Canto II cytometer (BD Biosciences). GFP fluorescence of a minimum of 20,000 cells was acquired using BD FACSDiva flow cytometry software (version 5.0). The determination of UROIIIS specific activity was based on the method developed by Jordan and modified by Tsai et al. and Hart and Battersby (28Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Leadbeater R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Tsai S.F. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. Anal.

Purified protein samples were obtained as described previously (15Fortian A. Castaño D. Ortega G. Laín A. Pons M. Millet O. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When testing the activity in eukaryotic cells, an aliquot of ten million untreated or MG132-treated cells were used, and the protein concentration was obtained by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as the standard and corrected for the number of cells that contained the GFP tag that was determined by flow cytometry. CD experiments were collected in a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter and analyzed as described previously (31Tadeo X. López-Méndez B. Trigueros T. Laín A. Castaño D. Millet O. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000257Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CD experiments were performed in a quartz cuvette with a 0.2-cm path length, whereas fluorescence data were recorded in a JASCO FP-6500 fluorometer. Sample concentration was set to 350 nm and 40 nm for the CD and fluorescence experiments, respectively. The experiments were run at 25 °C with samples that had been purified and stored at 4 °C. The C73R, C73A, C73D, C73S, C73N, C73L, and C73Y mutants of UROIIIS were modeled computationally using the Swiss Model Workspace (17Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6039) Google Scholar) and the Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine (Phyre) (18Bennett-Lovsey R.M. Herbert A.D. Sternberg M.J. Kelley L.A. Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Solvent accessibility calculations were carried out using the MOLMOL program with a probe radius of 1.4 Å and using the 1JR2 Protein Data Bank structure (12Mathews M.A. Schubert H.L. Whitby F.G. Alexander K.J. Schadick K. Bergonia H.A. Phillips J.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) for wild type and the modeled structure for C73R. PyMOL software was used for data representation and analysis of interatomic distances. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in two steps. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of mRNA, treated previously with RNase-free DNase, using random hexamers and SuperScript II in presence of RNase OUT. (All reagents were from Invitrogen.) The real-time step was carried out with 5 μl of 1:20 cDNA dilution and SYBR Green (Invitrogen) for 30 cycles (for 30 s at 94 °C, for 30 s at 60 °C, and for 30 s at 72 °C) on a Bio-Rad iCycler thermocycler. The samples were examined twice in triplicate for expression of neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII), UROIIIS, and acidic ribosomal protein (ARP). For UROIIIS, both N- and C-terminal Myc-tagged versions of the wild type and C73R mutant proteins were analyzed. The specific primers (and expected product sizes, in base pairs) are shown in supplemental Table S1. The relative level of each transcript was calculated on the basis of the ΔΔCt method and normalized to ARP as the reference gene. Amplicon size and reaction specificity was also confirmed by 2.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. To prepare cell lysates, 106 trypsinized cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in the presence of 100 μl of lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). After clarification of the samples by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube. The protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined by means of the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as the standard. SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, 65 °C, and 95 °C and separated on 4–12% precast acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). After transferring to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocking overnight (5% milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), the primary antibody was added for 1 h, followed by a PBS wash, and application of the secondary HRP-conjugated antibody. Chemiluminescent detection of bands was performed with ECL Plus reagent (GE Healthcare). The catalytic activity of UROIIIS is time-dependent because the enzyme is not thermodynamically stable and undergoes irreversible denaturation, followed by aggregation (11Bishop D.F. Johansson A. Phelps R. Shady A.A. Ramirez M.C. Yasuda M. Caro A. Desnick R.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 78: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Freshly purified UROIIIS-C73R retained one-third of the activity of the wild type enzyme, but at physiological temperature, the activity of the mutant protein decayed >10 times faster than the wild type protein (Fig. 1A). The decrease in the folded conformation over time was determined using CD, monitored at 37 °C and 222 nm (this wavelength reports on the α-helical content of the protein), and is shown in Fig. 1B. Wild type UROIIIS had a half-life of 61 h as compared with 15 min observed with C73R-UROIIIS, which was in very good agreement with the time dependence of the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Fig. 1C shows the CD spectra for the purified wild type (black line) and C73R (blue line) UROIIIS, which match significantly, consistent with the idea that both proteins share the same folding pattern. The lower intensity at 222 nm found in the C73R spectra is consistent with a slightly lower helical content for the mutant. The effect of the mutation was also investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, as UROIIIS has two tryptophan residues, both of which are found at the N-terminal domain, and Trp-83 is only 10Å away from CYS-73. Fig. 1D shows the emission spectrum for wild type UROIIIS (black line) and C73R (blue line). The shift in the maximum of the emission spectra indicates that the tryptophan of the mutant protein is more exposed to a polar environment. Using homology modeling programs (17Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6039) Google Scholar, 18Bennett-Lovsey R.M. Herbert A.D. Sternberg M.J. Kelley L.A. Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we generated a structural model of C73R-UROIIIS. Fig. 2 shows the overlay of the N-terminal domains of wild type (Protein Data Bank code 1JR2) (12Mathews M.A. Schubert H.L. Whitby F.G. Alexander K.J. Schadick K. Bergonia H.A. Phillips J.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the C73R (model), where Cys-73 and Arg-73 side chains have been highlighted by red and blue spheres, respectively. According to the model, the arginine side chain penetrates into the domain core. To further investigate the origin of UROIIIS destabilization upon mutation, a set of Cys-73 mutations that differ in the side chain volume and charge has been generated: C73A, C73D, C73S, C73N, C73L, and C73Y. Structural models for the mutants are also shown in Fig. 2, whereas the loss of stability over time, analyzed by CD, is shown in Fig. 1B. A certain correlation between the side chain volume and the acceleration of the unfolding process is observed (Fig. 2), consistent with the increase in the number contacts that large side chains have with the hydrophobic surrounding (supplemental Table S2). However, C73D shows higher stability than wild type UROIIIS and retained 100% of its enzymatic activity, demonstrating that Cys-73 does not play a significant role in catalysis, consistent with the proposed reaction mechanism (14Schubert H.L. Phillips J.D. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8648-8655Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the destabilization mechanism is complex, and the introduction of a negative charge in this position may also play a favorable role in increasing the free energy of the protein. By introducing a positive charge, C73R probably exerts the opposite effect, consistent with the very low stability found for this mutation. To investigate whether the loss of activity in vitro also is observed in the cell environment, several tagged versions of wild type and C73R-UROIIIS were analyzed in two different cell-types: a human fibroblast-derived cell line (named M1) and a murine hepatocyte-derived cell line (MLP29). M1 cell lines stably expressing N-terminal or C-terminal Myc-tagged versions of wild type and C73R mutant enzymes were generated, and the levels of the ectopically expressed proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. As expected, no signal was observed in the M1 parental cells (Fig. 3A). A clear specific band was observed in stable cell lines expressing wild type UROIIIS. When expressed in vitro and purified, this protein showed >80% of the activity of untagged UROIIIS (Fig. 1A), indicating that tagged version of this enzyme is functional. For the mutant, no specific bands were detected in stable cell lines expressing the C73R mutant protein. This result could not be assigned to additional stress induced by the ectopic expression of the different versions of UROIIIS protein because no significant differences were detected when two endogenous stress-inducible chaperones were analyzed (Hsp70 and Hsp90, Fig. 3A) (19Duncan R.F. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5244-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mammalian vector pCR3.1 utilized in this study also carried the gene encoding NPTII that was detected at similar levels in all the stable cell lines, indicating that all of cell lines contained functional vectors. qRT-PCR with the stable cell lines was used to discard the idea that the lack of mutant protein expression was due to a failure at the transcriptional level. Specific pair primers were designed to amplify the coding sequence for the N-terminal Myc-tagged UROIIIS (UROIIIS-Myc), C-terminal Myc-tagged UROIIIS (UROIIIS-Myc), vector-carried NPTII, and the housekeeping gene ARP. As an internal control, we certified that the corresponding primers amplified Myc-tagged UROIIIS and NPTII transcripts only in the stably transfected cell lines (Fig. 3B, upper panel). In the qRT-PCR assay, similar expression levels of NPTII were observed in stable cell lines transfected with the plasmids encoding the C-terminal Myc-tagged UROIIIS (wild type or C73R), whereas the expression levels of C73R UROIIIS-Myc were 2-fold higher than wild type UROIIIS-Myc (Fig. 3B, lower left panel). In the Myc-UROIIIS construct, a reduction in the transcript levels was observed upon mutation (Fig. 3B, lower right panel), but this was independent of the mutation because the transcript levels of NPTII and Myc-UROIIIS were similar. Together, the results obtained from the Western blot analysis and from qRT-PCR assay indicated that a defect in the transcription of the Myc-tagged UROIIIS mutant versions was not the origin of the lack of expression generated by the C73R mutation, supporting the idea that the protein mutant is unstable and quickly degraded in the cell, in agreement with the results obtained by the structural analysis. In this experiment, we analyzed the intracellular degradation of the C73R mutant. MLP29 cells stably expressing C73R-UROIIIS fused to GFP were incubated in the presence of proteasome (MG132) or lysosome (chloroquine, NH4Cl) inhibitors (Fig. 4). Treatment with chloroquine or NH4Cl affected the endosomal-lysosomal pathway (20Puertollano R. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3435-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as could be observed by the accumulation of the early endosomal marker EAA1, but no effect was observed in the C73R mutant cells as compared with the mock treatment. On the contrary, treatment with MG132 resulted in the accumulation of C73R along with p21 and ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 4). The protein accumulation induced by MG132 was independent of the tag position as shown by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 5A); the GFP-fused proteins of the C73R mutant were absent under regular conditions but could be detected at similar levels of expression when proteasome activity was inhibited with MG132. This treatment also caused an increase in the level of WT protein (supplemental Fig. S2). However, the intracellular localization of WT and C73R were different; cytosolic staining was observed for WT UROIIIS, whereas a partially aggregated pattern was detected for C73R-UROIIIS (Fig. 5B). This aggregation was not observed in cells expressing GFP-tagged wild type version of UROIIIS even at the highest expression levels, indicating that the aggregation was caused by C73R mutation and not by the accumulation of GFP moeties. A fraction of these cells were disrupted and tested for enzyme activity. Wild type and C73R-UROIIIS were both catalytically active and, remarkably, the mutant retained 50% of the activity when normalized with respect to wild type. Altogether, these results demonstrate the implication of the proteasome degradation pathway in the intracellular clearance of the wild type enzyme and the misfolded C73R mutant.FIGURE 5A, GFP fluorescence of unmodified MLP29 cells (control) or cells stably expressing GFP-tagged versions of UROIIIS-C73R in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (mock) or MG132 was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Clinically speaking, C73R is, by far, the most relevant mutation in CEP (10Frank J. Wang X. Lam H.M. Aita V.M. Jugert F.K. Goerz G. Merk H.F. Poh-Fitzpatrick M.B. Christiano A.M. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 225-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have studied the molecular basis of this hotspot mutation. Our results show that the mutation does not involve a residue important for catalysis. Instead, the C73R mutation, due to a combination of factors, produces a conformational change ultimately responsible for decreased kinetic stability of the molecule, because in vitro, the unfolding half-life dropped from 2.5 days (WT) to 15 min (C73R) at 37 °C. In two distinct mammalian cell types, the mutant was undetectable as compared with WT UROIIIS that could be overexpressed in the cell. From these data, a model emerges where the active conformation of WT UROIIIS is unstable thermodynamically but remains folded long enough to exert its function. This would not to be the case for the C73R-UROIIIS, which is expressed in the cell but rapidly unfolds and is degraded quickly, resulting in undetectable protein levels in the cell. Numerous diseases have been related to mutations that result in decreased stability of an enzyme. For instance, the ΔPhe-508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor is responsible for >70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis (21Kerem B. Rommens J.M. Buchanan J.A. Markiewicz D. Cox T.K. Chakravarti A. Buchwald M. Tsui L.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar), and destabilizing mutations in G protein-coupled receptors are responsible for diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (22Conn P.M. Ulloa-Aguirre A. Ito J. Janovick J.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2007; 59: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For some of these pathologies, it has been shown that certain substances can act as “chemical chaperones” to slow down or inhibit their tendency to aggregate, resulting in detectable enzyme levels in the cell (23Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that some of these co-solutes could equally act on C73R-UROIIIS, and we are actively pursuing such studies. The proteasome complex plays a critical role in signal transduction pathways for cell growth and survival, cell-cycle control, and in protein turnover, which is crucial to maintain cellular homeostasis. Here, we have shown that degradation of UROIIIS depends on the activity of the proteasome instead of the lysosome pathway, providing a molecular explanation for the failure of chloroquine treatment in CEP patients (24Lagarde C. Hamel-Teillac D. De Prost Y. Blanche S. Thomas C. Fischer A. Nordmann Y. Ged C. De Verneuil H. Ann. Dermatol. Venereol. 1998; 125: 114-117PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the degradation process can be reverted by inhibiting proteasome activity, and even though the accumulation of the mutant protein in the cell results in partial aggregation, we show that the enzyme retains partial catalytic activity. The sensitivity of transformed cells to proteasome inhibitors along with the successful design of treatment protocols with tolerable therapeutic indices has made proteasome inhibition a viable strategy for cancer treatment. Clinical validation of the proteasome as a molecular target was achieved with the approval of bortezomib, a boronic acid proteasome inhibitor, for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma (25Schenkein D. Clin. Lymphoma. 2002; 3: 49-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several “next-generation” proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and PR-047, NPI-0052, and CEP-18770 represent the distinct structural classes of peptidyl epoxyketones, β-lactones, and peptidyl boronic acids, respectively) with different mechanisms of action, pharmacological and pharmacodynamic activity profiles, and therapeutic indices recently have entered clinical development (reviewed in Ref. 26Ruggeri B. Miknyoczki S. Dorsey B. Hui A.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2009; 57: 91-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results argue positively for the possibility to expand the clinical utility of proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of specific non-oncological purposes. Although further studies are required, the partial inhibition of the proteasome may constitute a new therapeutic modality for CEP patients. Download .pdf (1.27 MB) Help with pdf files"

IDE is made up of four structurally similar domains arranged into a U-like conformation, with only the N-terminal most domain retaining a functional active site (9Shen Y. Joachimiak A. Rosner M.R.

This property appears dependent on association to form a homodimer (8Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol.

With small synthetic peptide substrates IDE exhibits a sigmoidal rate versus substrate response indicative of allosteric enzymes showing homotropic activation or activation by substrate. In addition IDE is activated by small physiological peptides such as bradykinin and dynorphin (8Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) by what can be termed “heterotrophic activation” or activation by molecules other than the substrate. We recently obtained evidence that peptide activators bind to a site on the enzyme we refer to as the distal site. 3N. Noinaj, S. K. Bhasin, E. S. Song, K. Scoggin, M. A. Juliano, L. Juliano, L. B. Hersh, and D. W. Rodgers, submitted manuscript. Both this distal site as well as the active site was found to contain a peptide derived from TEV protease release of the polyHis and linker region from an inactive IDE fusion protein. As might be expected with active IDE neither the active site nor the distal site is occupied by the same TEV protease treatment, presumably due to degradation of the released polyHis-containing peptide. This distal site makes extended binding contacts with larger peptide substrates such as Aβ and insulin (11Manolopoulou M. Guo Q. Malito E. Schilling A.B. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14177-14188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and has been reported to bind a small substrate in a non-catalytic mode (12Malito E. Ralat L.A. Manolopoulou M. Tsay J.L. Wadlington N.L. Tang W.J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12822-12834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to activation by small peptides, IDE is activated by polyphosphates such as ATP and triphosphate (13Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Fried M.G. Wagner S.L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54216-54220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Yao H. Hersh L.B. Arch. Biochem.

Bhasin, B. J. Alper, W. K. Schmidt, L. B. Hersh, and D. W. Rodgers, submitted manuscript. The finding that IDE can be activated by peptides and polyphosphates makes it an excellent target for the development of small molecules that could be used in the treatment of Alzheimer disease (15Cabrol C. Huzarska M.A. Dinolfo C. Rodriguez M.C. Reinstatler L. Ni J. Yeh L.A. Cuny G.D. Stein R.L. Selkoe D.J. Leissring M.A. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the mechanism of activation of IDE should facilitate such efforts. To this end we have made use of mutations that affect catalytic activity, substrate binding at the active site, and activation via the distal site to further study the mechanism of activation of IDE in the context of the IDE dimer. Mixed oligomers, of IDE were generated by using baculovirus to co-express wild type and IDE mutant forms in Sf9 insect cells (8Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mutations introduced into IDE included E111F, which removes the catalytic glutamate that serves to facilitate attack of water on the scissile bond, H112Q, which removes this zinc binding residue, and Y609F, which reduces allosteric activation produced at a distal substrate binding site. None of these mutations affect the overall structure of the enzyme as shown by circular dichroism measurements, Fig. 1. In each case we added to Sf9 cells baculovirus coding for an inactive form of IDE containing a hexahistidine affinity tag attached through a linker containing a TEV protease site mixed with baculovirus expressing an active form of IDE devoid of an affinity tag. Preliminary experiments were conducted in which each baculovirus culture was titered with respect to expression of its respective IDE form. Different viruses were then mixed to optimize equal co-expression of each IDE form. As noted under “Results,” we usually obtained lower yields of mixed dimer than anticipated. Although not investigated it is possible that the inactive enzyme forms tend to generate homodimers rather than heterodimers. Oligomeric forms were generated in 200-ml cultures expressed for 72 h and isolated by Ni-affinity chromatography using a 2-ml HIS-select Ni-NTA-agarose column as previously described (16Song E.S.

This method yielded catalytically active oligomers composed of the His-tagged inactive subunit and non-tagged catalytically active subunits. Oligomers containing both inactive subunits copurified using this approach, but did not contribute to activity measurements. To determine the concentration of active (non-affinity tagged) IDE the isolated oligomers were subjected to SDS-PAGE on duplicate gels along with IDE-His6 as a standard. Following transfer to PDVF membranes one membrane was treated with a rabbit anti-IDE antibody (1Miller B.C. Eckman E.A. Sambamurti K. Dobbs N. Chow K.M. Eckman C.B. Hersh L.B. Thiele D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6221-6226Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) at 1/1,000 while the other was treated with mouse anti-His6 antibody (GE, Healthcare Life, Sciences) at 1/1,000. Following incubation for 1 h with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/20,000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc.) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (1/5,000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Inc.) the immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL using Western blotting Detection Reagents from GE Healthcare. The ratio of the intensity of anti-His antibody staining (inactive IDE) and the intensity of staining obtained using an anti-IDE antibody (total IDE) was calibrated on theWestern blot using fully His-tagged IDE. The ratio of anti-His/anti-total IDE was assigned a value, N. The amount of active IDE subunit was calculated as follows: The observed anti-His staining/N yields the expected anti-IDE staining for the fraction of His-tagged IDE present in the mixture and is designated as X. Total anti-IDE immunostaining is equal to the anti-IDE staining for the His-tagged IDE (X) plus the amount of non-His-tagged IDE present. Thus the amount of non-His-tagged IDE is equal to the total staining minus X and is designated Y. The fraction of non-His-tagged IDE present is calculated as Equation 1. Y/(X+Y)(Eq. 1) We found more reproducible results were obtained with the His tag removed by treatment with TEV protease, so the above analysis was conducted prior to His tag removal. The fluorogenic peptide Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp was routinely used for measuring IDE activity. This internally quenched FRET peptide is cleaved at the RK bond resulting in an increase in fluorescence as previously described (16Song E.S. Mukherjee A. Juliano M.A. Pyrek J.S. Goodman Jr., J.P. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1152-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, IDE, 10 μm Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp, and the indicated concentration of peptides when added in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction was continuously monitored at 37 °C for 30 min. using a SpectraMax Gemini XS fluorescence plate reader. Kinetic data were fit to either a hyperbolic substrate versus velocity response curve (Michaelis-Menten equation) or to a sigmoidal response curve using Graphpad software. Experiments were repeated two or three times with different enzyme preparations. For monitoring the activity of fractions eluted from a Amersham Biosciences Superdex S200 column, the reaction contained 195 μl of the column fraction prewarmed to 37 °C, with the reaction initiated by adding 5 μl of 400 mm Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp. Assay times varied from 30 min to 240 min depending on the activity of the eluted enzyme. The reaction of IDE with amyloid β peptide (Aβ1–40) was measured by two different methods. In one method we used a biotinylated/fluorescently labeled Aβ analog Aβ1–40-Lys(Biotin)FAM-labeled (AnaSpec, Inc.). Reactions (200 μl) containing 0.5 μm Aβ1–40-Lys(Biotin)FAM-labeled in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, plus 0.05% Tween-20 were incubated with 50–400 ng of IDE for 30 min. at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 200 mm 1–10-phenanthroline to produce a final concentration of 1 mm and then 15 μl of agarose bound avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) was added to bind any unreacted Aβ1–40-Lys(Biotin)FAM-labeled and C-terminally biotin labeled reaction products. After centrifugation for 5 min, the supernatant containing released FAM-labeled peptide products was measured on a Spectramax plate reader at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 528 nm. Total fluorescence released from Aβ1–40-Lys(Biotin)FAM-labeled was determined by the same procedure using an excess of IDE and used to calculate fractional release in the various incubations. The second method employed was a sandwich ELISA assay for Aβ. Reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 100 nm Aβ1–40 and enzyme in a total volume of 20 μl were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by diluting >1,000-fold into PBS-T (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20) to yield ∼100 pm Aβ. A 100-μl aliquot was transferred to a Maxisorp Nunc plate precoated with anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 (anti-Aβ1–6) (Covance Signet) diluted 1:500. After incubating for 2–3 h at room temperature and then at 4 °C overnight, the plate was washed and 100 μl of biotinylated anti-Aβ antibody 4G8 (anti-17–24) (Covance Signet) at a 1/2,000 dilution was added. After incubating for 2 h at room temperature, the plate was washed three times with TBST, and 100 μl of streptavidin-HRP (1:10,000) (KPL) was added followed by a 1.5 h incubation at room temperature. After removal of the streptavidin-HRP, 100 μl of a 1:1 mix of TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the reaction allowed to proceed for ∼30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1% H2SO4, and samples were read on a plate reader at 450 nm. A standard curve was constructed with varying amounts of Aβ1–40. The binding of the fluorescent Aβ1–40 analog Aβ1–40 FAM-labeled (AnaSpec, Inc.) to IDE was measured by following the change in fluorescence anisotropy when increasing amounts of IDE (0–3 μm) was added to 1 μm FAM-labeled Aβ1–40 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer in a total volume of 200 μl. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured at 23 °C using a SpectraMax M5 fluorescence plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 494 nm and an emission wavelength of 521 nm. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the data using Prism software to Equation 2 (18Parker M.W. Hellman L.M. Xu P. Fried M.G. Vander Kooi C.W. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), r=r0+ra[IDE]/(Kd+[IDE])(Eq. 2) where r is the observed anisotropy, ro is the initial anisotropy, and ra is the difference in anisotropy between bound and free fluorescent Aβ1–40. The oligomerization state of the various IDE preparations was determined by gel filtration using a Amersham Biosciences Superdex S200 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min at 4 °C. The column was standardized with a gel filtration calibration kit (GE, Healthcare Life Sciences). A 0.5-ml IDE sample was loaded at 1 mg/ml, with the column run at 0.4 ml/min with 1-ml fractions collected. Using this concentration of protein, the IDE activity in the eluted fractions was assayed without further dilution so as to approximate the same active enzyme concentrations used in kinetic experiments. All samples were diluted to ∼0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and placed in a 0.1-cm path length cuvette prior to measuring circular dichroism spectra. Spectra were taken over a range of 200–250 nm in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD), measuring values every 0.2 nm. Four spectra were averaged for each IDE construct. It has been established that the distal part of the extended substrate binding site of IDE can bind peptides and reaction products (11Manolopoulou M. Guo Q. Malito E. Schilling A.B. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14177-14188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 3N. Noinaj, S. K. Bhasin, E. S. Song, K. Scoggin, M. A. Juliano, L. Juliano, L. B. Hersh, and D. W. Rodgers, submitted manuscript. We have found that mutation of a tyrosine within this distal binding site, Tyr-609, disrupts allosteric activation, and thus we have proposed that this distal site is an allosteric binding site. 3N. Noinaj, S. K. Bhasin, E. S. Song, K. Scoggin, M. A. Juliano, L. Juliano, L. B. Hersh, and D. W. Rodgers, submitted manuscript. Because IDE functions primarily as a dimer we set out to determine whether binding at the substrate binding site and binding at the distal binding site can produce allosteric activation by a cis or trans mechanism. To accomplish this we generated a series of oligomeric IDE molecules in which mutations were introduced into the active site, the distal allosteric site, or both. These oligomeric IDE variants were expressed with one subunit, generally an inactive subunit, containing a hexahistidine affinity tag, and the active subunit having no affinity tag. Isolation of the oligomers on a nickel resin produced enzyme that contains at least one inactive subunit. We first compared the kinetics of IDE derived by expressing the enzyme with both subunits containing a hexahistidine affinity tag (His6IDE)2 to IDE in which one subunit contained a His affinity tag and the other did not (His6IDE-IDE). Kinetic analysis showed that expressing IDE where both subunits contained a His tag or where only one subunit contained a His tag gave the same kinetic constants with the synthetic substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp and that removal of the His tag did not affect kinetic properties. However, we did note that the enzyme containing a His affinity tag on both subunits seemed to be activated to a slightly greater extent (5–6-fold versus ∼3–4-fold) by small peptides. To avoid any potential affect of the His affinity tag we routinely removed it prior to analysis. We next compared the kinetic properties of mixed oligomers of IDE in which one subunit contained the wild-type sequence and the other contained either the E111F mutation or the H112Q mutation. Both of these mutations decrease enzyme activity to less than 1% of the wild-type enzyme (17Song E.S. Daily A. Fried M.G. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17701-17706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) however the E111F mutation does not affect substrate binding. In contrast the H112Q mutation increases Km 5–10-fold (17Song E.S. Daily A. Fried M.G. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17701-17706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1 when IDE contains one active subunit and an inactive subunit that binds substrate poorly (IDE:IDEH112Q) there is little or no effect on kcat (expressed as turnover per active subunit), Km, or the extent of cooperativity as measured by the Hill coefficient with Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp as substrate. This indicates that substrate turnover by IDE can occur through one subunit independent of the other. However, expressing IDE containing one active subunit and an inactive subunit that retains substrate binding (IDE:IDEE111F) lowers the observed kcat more than 10-fold, but does not affect Km or the Hill coefficient. This finding suggests that once bound, substrate induces a conformational change in the adjacent subunit that lowers its activity. This effect could result from intervals of activity alternating between subunits, although the observed similar kcat values for the wild-type dimer (IDE:IDE) and the dimer with one non-binding subunit (IDE:IDEH112Q) indicates that the alternating between subunits in itself is not rate-limiting. This follows since if alternating between subunits were slow relative to catalysis, then on a per subunit basis the dimeric enzyme with two active subunits would exhibit a lower kcat than a dimeric enzyme with only one non-interacting active subunit. Comparing IDE:IDE and IDE:IDEH112Q, which as noted exhibit the same kcat, indicates that this is not the case. The effect is marked in IDE:IDEE111F presumably because substrate bound to the catalytically compromised subunit has a long residence time when it is not cleaved. Even though binding to the inactive subunit in IDE:IDEE111F decreases activity, cooperativity is still observed. This observation plus the finding that IDE:IDEH112Q, which binds substrate poorly, also exhibits full cooperativity shows that activation by substrate (homotropic allosteric activation) is independent of whether or not substrate is bound to the active site of the adjacent subunit. Thus homotropic allosteric affects can be attributed to binding at a site other than the active site. This is consistent with our recent finding that peptide-dependent activation occurs though binding to what we have termed the “distal site” on IDE. 3N. Noinaj, S. K. Bhasin, E. S. Song, K.

Open table in a new tab Gel filtration analysis showed that all of the oligomers regardless of their composition or enzymatic activity were predominantly dimers but contained some tetramer and to a much lesser extent higher molecular weight oligomers. Thus the presence of a catalytically inactive subunit does not produce a significant affect on the oligomerization state of IDE. This is shown in Fig. 2. Molecular weight determinations were performed by gel filtration loading IDE at 1 mg/ml such that the eluted enzyme concentration approximated the IDE concentration in the assaysused for kinetic analysis and thus reflects the oligomeric state of the various IDE forms during activity assays. IDE has been shown to be subject to heterotrophic activation by small peptide substrates such as bradykinin and dynorphin (8Song E.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49789-49794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These peptides appear to bind to the distal site (11Manolopoulou M. Guo Q. Malito E. Schilling A.B.

Therefore we looked at the effect of the catalytically inactive subunit on the ability of peptide activators to increase the activity of the mixed dimers. Peptide activation did not seem to be affected to any significant extent by either type of mutation in the active site of one subunit; compare IDE:IDE, IDE:IDEH112Q, and IDE:IDEE111F in Table 2.TABLE 2Activation of IDE dimeric forms by dynorphin B9 and bradykininIDE oligomerFold activation by dynorphin B9Fold activation by bradykininIDE:IDE2.32.8IDE:IDEH112Q2.53.0IDE:IDEE111F3.23.7IDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F2.32.7IDE:IDEE111F,Y609F3.23.3Y609FIDE:IDEY609F1.41.9Y609FIDE:IDEH112Q1.71.8Y609FIDE:IDEE111F1.21.4Y609FIDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F1.21.7Y609FIDE:IDEE111F,Y609F0. 81.2 Open table in a new tab As alluded to above, we previously identified a distal site that is comprised of a portion of the extended substrate-binding site. We previously showed that binding to the distal site is what actually produces the observed allosteric activation. 3N. Noinaj, S. K. Bhasin, E. S. Song, K. Scoggin, M. A. Juliano, L. Juliano, L. B. Hersh, and D. W. Rodgers, submitted manuscript. Larger IDE peptide substrates such as insulin or amyloid β-peptide bind to the active site and are large enough to make extended binding interactions at the distal site and thus do not exhibit homotropic cooperativity. The substrate Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp is not large enough to extend binding interactions to the allosteric distal site, however either its hydrolytic product or a second molecule of substrate can bind to this distal site. We thus asked the question as to whether activation through the distal site can occur on the same subunit, the adjacent subunit, or on either subunit. To answer this question we introduced a mutation into the distal site, Y609F, which we have shown eliminates allosteric kinetics. 3N. Noinaj, S. K. Bhasin, E. S. Song, K. Scoggin, M. A. Juliano, L. Juliano, L. B. Hersh, and D. W. Rodgers, submitted manuscript. As shown in Table 1 when the Y609F mutation is introduced into both active subunits (Y609FIDE:IDEY609F) there is a 4–5-fold decrease in catalytic activity accompanied by a change in the Hill coefficient from ∼2 for wild-type IDE to ∼1 for the Y609F mutant. Mutation of the distal binding site on only the inactive subunit (IDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F or IDE:IDEE111F,Y609F) does not affect the allosteric nature of the reaction as judged by the absence of a change in the Hill coefficient. This strongly supports the concept of cis activation and suggests that allosteric activation by substrate, reaction products, or other peptides occurs within the same catalytically active subunit. However, a lower kcat value is observed when the distal site is mutated in the catalytically incompetent non-binding subunit; compare IDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F to IDE:IDEH112Q. This further suggests that although peptide binding to the distal site of the catalytic subunit produces cis activation, disruption of the allosteric site of the second subunit in the dimer can affect the activity of the adjacent subunit. We next examined the effect of mutating the distal site on the catalytic subunit, but having this site available on the inactive subunit, Table 1. The absence of the distal site on the catalytic subunit eliminates cooperativity, regardless of whether or not the inactive subunit has an intact distal binding site as seen in the Hill coefficients for Y609FIDE:IDEH112Q, Y609FIDE:IDEE111F, Y609FIDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F, or Y609FIDE:IDEE111F,Y609F. This finding further confirms homotropic cooperativity as resulting from cis binding to the distal site on the catalytically active subunit. With the IDEH112Q mutant, the Y609F mutation on the active subunit decreases kcat as expected (compare IDE:IDEH112Q to Y609FIDE:IDEH112Q). Interestingly, however a different situation occurs when the inactive subunit can bind substrate. In this case introducing the Y609F mutation into the active subunit has no additional effect on kcat (compare IDE:IDEE111F to Y609FIDE:IDEE111F). Here the effect of maintaining bound peptide at the active site of the catalytically compromised subunit must dominate the functioning of the active subunit. That the distal site can work in cis with the catalytic site is further supported by the data obtained when measuring the ability of the peptides dynorphin B9 and bradykinin to activate hydrolysis of Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp as substrate. As illustrated in Table 2 all of the enzyme forms that contain an intact distal site on the catalytic subunit, regardless of the presence (IDE:IDE, IDE:IDEH112Q, IDE:IDEE111F) or absence (IDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F, IDE:IDEE111F,Y609F) of an intact distal site on the non catalytic subunit exhibit the same 2–3-fold activation. In contrast, when the distal site is mutated on the catalytic subunit in the absence (Y609FIDE:IDEY609F, Y609FIDE:IDEH112Q, Y609FIDE:IDEE111F) or presence (Y609FIDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F, Y609FIDE:IDEE111F,Y609F) of a second mutation on the inactive subunit, activation is diminished. We also examined the effect of mutations in the distal site on the hydrolysis of a substrate that spans the active site and binds at the distal site, amyloid β peptide 1–40 (Aβ1–40). We employed two different assays; for one assay we used a biotinylated, N-terminal carboxyl fluorescein (FAM) labeled Aβ1–40 and in the other we used an Aβ sandwich ELISA. As shown in Table 3 there was generally good agreement between the two methods. The mixed dimer in which the inactive subunit does not bind substrate (IDE:IDEH112Q) exhibited a slightly higher activity than wild-type IDE as confirmed in both assays; however, there is a decrease in the rate when the inactive subunit can bind substrate (IDE:IDEE111F). This is the same effect observed with Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp as substrate as noted in Table 1. When the distal site is mutated on both subunits (Y609FIDE:IDEY609F) there is an even greater decrease in the reaction rate as would be expected if the Y609F mutation interfered with substrate activation through the distal site.TABLE 3Reaction of dimeric IDE with amyloid β peptideIDE oligomerFluorescent AbaReaction mixtures contained 0.5 μm Aβ1–40-Lys(Biotin)FAM-labeled and 50–400 ng of IDE in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4.

Open table in a new tab When the distal site is mutated on the inactive subunit regardless of whether or not the inactive subunit can bind substrate (IDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F and IDE:IDEE111F,Y609F) there is a decrease in the reaction rate, a result in contrast to our findings with smaller peptides. This is most evident for IDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F and suggests that Aβ1–40 can interact at the distal site on the non-catalytic subunit and that this interaction enhances catalysis. This seems to occur whether or not binding at the active site is impaired. That bound Aβ1–40 can activate in a trans manner is further supported by the relatively high reaction rates of the Y609FIDE:IDEH112Q and IDE:IDEH112Q mutants. The low reaction rate of Y609FIDE:IDEE111F and particularlyY609FIDE:IDEE111F, Y609F may reflect, as seen with Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp as substrate, high occupancy binding to the noncatalytic subunit that inhibits the active subunit. We next used the fluorescent N-terminal FAM-labeled Aβ1–40 to directly measure binding to IDE by following the increase in anisotropy that occurs when the fluorescent Aβ is bound to the enzyme. No binding was observed with the homodimeric (IDEH112Q)2 or (IDEH112Q,Y609F)2 confirming our previous report that substrate binding is diminished by the H112Q mutation. IDE forms containing the E111F mutation showed a stable anisotropy reading over at least 60 min. We thus measured the binding of fluorescent Aβ to (IDEE111F,Y609F)2 and (IDEE111F)2 (Fig. 3). The binding of the fluorescent Aβ to (IDEE111F)2, exhibited a slightly higher Kd (0.63 ± 0.03 μm) compared with (IDEE111F,Y609F)2 which exhibited a Kd of 0.25 ± 0.05 μm). The same Kd values were obtained using two different enzyme preparations. Thus the Y609F mutation does not in itself prevent binding, but is involved in allosteric activation. By utilizing combinations of point mutations that affect catalysis, substrate binding, and allosteric activation we have further explored the IDE reaction mechanism and uncovered new insights into the complexity of the reaction. For example when only one subunit in the dimeric enzyme binds substrate, the single active site can function as well as the dimeric enzyme in terms of kcat, Km, and Hill coefficient. This means that under some circumstances a subunit within the IDE dimer can function independently. However, when the adjacent catalytically compromised subunit is capable of binding substrate the reaction rate at the other subunit is substantially reduced. Therefore an intact substrate bound in the active site appears to transmit a conformational change to the other subunit that affects catalysis. Because there is not a significant difference per active subunit between the kcat values for a dimer with two fully active subunits compared with a dimer with one subunit inactive in terms of both substrate binding and turnover (IDE:IDE versus IDE:IDEH112Q), the resident time of the intact substrate at a functioning active site must be short relative to the overall catalytic cycle and contribute little to reducing kcat. We have also found that the observed cooperativity in the IDE reaction with Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp as substrate can be attributed to cis binding to the distal part of the extended substrate binding site. That is, binding to the active site and to the distal site on the same subunit can produce cooperativity as evidenced by a Hill coefficient of ∼2 with all dimeric enzyme forms having an intact cis distal site, and a Hill coefficient of ∼1 with all dimeric enzyme forms containing a distal site Y609F mutation on the catalytic subunit. Interestingly, with both the H112Q and E111F mutants and Aβ1–40 as substrate there appears to be a decrease in catalysis when the distal site is mutated on the non-catalytic subunit, indicating that under some circumstances there also can be communication between subunits via the distal site. A cis activation mechanism is further supported by the finding of the increase in the rate of hydrolysis of Abz-GGFLRKHGQ-EDDnp by added dynorphin B9 and bradykinin. This heterotropic activation is observed when the distal site on the catalytic subunit is intact regardless of whether the active site is mutated on the adjacent catalytically compromised subunit (IDE:IDEH112Q and IDE:IDEE111F) or when both the active site and distal site on the adjacent catalytically compromised subunit are mutated (IDE:IDEH112Q,Y609F and IDE:IDEE111F,Y609F). In contrast when the distal site on the catalytic subunit is mutated, activation by dynorphin B9 and bradykinin is diminished regardless of the mutational status of the non-catalytic subunit. When measuring the direct binding of Aβ to IDE we were surprised to find that the Y609F mutation did not decrease binding affinity, and if anything increased the affinity of the enzyme for Aβ. The simplest interpretation is that the Y609F mutation still supports binding of peptide to the distal site, but prevents the bound peptide from triggering the conformational changes that activate the enzyme. That is Tyr609 does not contribute to Aβ binding per se even though its appears well positioned to do so based on crystal structures with peptide bound at the distal site (11Manolopoulou M. Guo Q.

Juliano, L. Juliano, L. B. Hersh, and D. W. Rodgers, submitted manuscript. Instead, we suggest that Tyr609 facilitates a conformational change leading to IDE activation. As we have recently shown this conformational change is likely to involve a small translation of the two haves of the IDE molecule relative to each other, 3N. Noinaj, S. K. Bhasin, E. S. Song, K. Scoggin, M. A. Juliano, L. Juliano, L. B. Hersh, and D. W. Rodgers, submitted manuscript. which likely alters the partitioning between the open and closed forms of the clamshell-like enzyme. In summary we have shown that the individual subunits in the IDE oligomer have the capacity to function independently, but there is also communication between the subunits. Activation by binding to the distal region of the substrate-binding site occurs primarily through a cis mechanism, but the distal site of the adjacent subunit can affect activity in trans. The hydrolysis rate of large substrates that interact with both the active and distal sites is particularly dependent on the interaction at the distal site."
https://openalex.org/W2072423467,"Introduction The Microbicides Development Programme evaluated the safety and effectiveness of 0.5% and 2% PRO2000/5 microbicide gels in reducing the risk of vaginally acquired HIV. In February 2008 the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that evaluation of 2% PRO2000/5 gel be discontinued due to futility. The Africa Centre site systematically collected participant responses to this discontinuation. Methods Clinic and field staff completed field reports using ethnographic participant observation techniques. In-depth-interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with participants discontinued from 2% gel. A total of 72 field reports, 12 in-depth-interviews and 3 focus groups with 250 women were completed for this analysis. Retention of discontinued participants was also analysed. Qualitative data was analysed using NVivo 2 and quantitative data using STATA 10.0. Results Participants responded initially with fear that discontinuation was due to harm, followed by acceptance after effective messaging, and finally with disappointment. Participants reported that their initial fear was exacerbated by being contacted and advised to visit the clinic for information about the closure. Operational changes were subsequently made to the contact procedures. By incorporating feedback from participants, messages were continuously revised to ensure that information was comprehensible and misconceptions were addressed quickly thereby enabling participants to accept the discontinuation. Participants were disappointed that 2% PRO2000/5 was being excluded as a HIV prevention option, but also that they would no longer have access to gel that improved their sexual relationships with their partners and assisted condom negotiations. In total 238 women were discontinued from gel and 185 (78%) went on to complete their scheduled follow-up period. Discussion The use of qualitative social science techniques allowed the site team to amend operational procedures and messaging throughout the discontinuation period. This proved instrumental in ensuring that the discontinuation was successfully completed in a manner that was both understandable and acceptable to participants.

These results highlight the importance of protein-protein binding kinetics for specific biotin addition to carboxylases and provide one mechanism for determining biotin distribution in metabolism. Post-translational protein modification is ubiquitous in biology and influences critical processes including metabolism, protein degradation, and gene expression. The water-soluble vitamin biotin, a required cofactor for biotin-dependent carboxylases, functions as a transient carrier of carboxyl groups in their transfer from bicarbonate to small molecule metabolites, such as acetyl-CoA. The five mammalian biotin-dependent carboxylases function in gluconeogenesis, amino acid catabolism, and fatty acid synthesis and degradation (1Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In its coenzyme function biotin must be covalently linked to a carboxylase in a highly specific post-translational modification reaction catalyzed by biotin protein ligases (BPLs). 2The abbreviations used are: BPL, biotin protein ligase; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; bio-5′-AMP, biotinyl-5′-adenylate; Ec, Escherichia coli; Hs, Homo sapiens; p67, carboxyl-terminal fragment of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase α subunit; Ph, Pyrococcus horikoshii; SUMO protein, small ubiquitin-like modifier protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. In this two-step reaction (Fig. 1A) an intermediate, bio-5′-AMP, is first formed from biotin and ATP substrates, and the biotin is then linked via its carboxyl group to the ϵ amine of a specific lysine residue on the carboxylase (2Lane M.D. Rominger K.L. Young D.L. Lynen F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The target lysine residue is on the biotin carboxylase carrier protein (BCCP) domain of the carboxylase, an enzyme complex composed of multiple copies of BCCP, biotin carboxylase, and carboxyl transferase moieties (1Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Previous studies of specificity in post-translational biotin addition are inconclusive. In any single organism, with few exceptions, only the specific target lysine on carboxylase substrates is biotinylated. Consistent with this specificity, the Pyrococcus horikoshii ligase-BCCP structure, in which BCCP refers to a minimal biotin accepting domain, is characterized by an extensive protein-protein interface (3Bagautdinov B. Matsuura Y. Bagautdinova S. Kunishima N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14739-14750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, a lack of specificity is evident from numerous examples of interspecies biotinylation. For example, in vivo the Escherichia coli ligase biotinylates BCCP domains from yeast (4Polyak S.W. Chapman-Smith A. Brautigan P.J. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32847-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), human (5Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7003-7006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the human p67, a commonly used substrate that includes propionyl-CoA carboxylase BCCP, can be biotinylated by partially purified BPLs from at least nine other organisms (8Slavoff S.A. Chen I. Choi Y.A. Ting A.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 1160-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9León-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This interspecies biotinylation may be attributable to the high degree of sequence conservation among ligases and BCCP domains. Alternatively, the qualitative nature of the methods used to measure interspecies reactivity may have precluded detection of selectivity in the reaction. Comparison of BPL-BCCP pairs from E. coli (Ec), P. horikoshii (Ph) and Homo sapiens (Hs), which represent three phylogenetic domains, illustrates the sequence and structural conservation among the enzymes and substrates. For example, the most disparate ligase catalytic domain sequences of E. coli and human (Fig. 1B) maintain 26% sequence identity and 43% similarity (10Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). Moreover, the structures of the catalytic domains of the E. coli and P. horikoshi enzymes are nearly superimposable (11Wilson K.P. Shewchuk L.M. Brennan R.G. Otsuka A.J. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 9257-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 12Bagautdinov B. Kuroishi C. Sugahara M. Kunishima N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overlay of BCCP structures from the three organisms reveals that, with the exception of the “thumb” on the E. coli domain, they are identical (Fig. 2A). At the primary sequence level (Fig. 2B), the most disparate BCCP sequences from human and E. coli display 35% identity and 54% similarity (10Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). As indicated above, ligase-catalyzed biotinylation occurs in two steps, and steady-state measurements with the human ligase revealed that bio-5′-AMP synthesis is the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction. However, a single-turnover stopped-flow fluorescence assay in which the preformed enzyme-intermediate complex is mixed with the BCCP substrate provides specific information about the ligase-acceptor protein interaction independent of the bio-5′-AMP synthesis step. Stopped-flow measurements of the HsBPL-catalyzed biotin transfer from the intermediate to a human BCCP substrate revealed a linear dependence of the apparent rate on substrate protein concentration with no evidence of leveling off (13Ingaramo M. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30862-30870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Nenortas E. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The simplest interpretation of this kinetic behavior is that the assay reports on the bimolecular collision of the enzyme with substrate protein. However, it is not known whether this is a general feature of the BPL-catalyzed reaction. Additionally, the stopped-flow measurements, which monitor the disappearance of the enzyme-intermediate complex, provide no information about product accumulation in the reaction and, consequently, about which step limits turnover in the second half-reaction. In this work, the single turnover stopped-flow and a quench-flow assay that allows monitoring of product formation are applied to studies of the second step in BPL-catalyzed biotinylation. Measurements performed on three cognate enzyme-substrate pairs from E. coli, P. horikoshii, and H. sapiens yield linear rate versus substrate concentration profiles in both assays. Furthermore, for each cognate enzyme-acceptor protein pair the bimolecular rates obtained using the stopped-flow and quench-flow assays are identical. Thus, bimolecular association of the enzyme-intermediate complex with BCCP substrate limits post-translational biotin transfer from bio-5′-AMP to the acceptor protein. In addition, measurements performed on noncognate enzyme-substrate pairs reveal distinct levels of substrate selectivity by the three enzymes. The control of the biotin transfer rate by enzyme-substrate collision coupled with the discrimination in noncognate reactions stresses the importance of protein-protein recognition in post-translational biotin addition and has implications for control of biotin distribution in metabolism. All chemicals used in buffer preparation were at least reagent grade. Bio-5′-AMP was synthesized and purified as previously described (2Lane M.D. Rominger K.L. Young D.L. Lynen F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Abbott J. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9649-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Biotin d-[2,3,4,6-3H] was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals and stored under argon at −70 °C. Unlabeled d-biotin and ATP were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The ATP concentration in stock solutions, which were prepared by dissolving adenosine 5′-triphosphate disodium salt into water and adjusting the pH to 7.5, were determined by UV absorbance using an extinction coefficient at 259 nm of 15,400 m cm−1. Biotin solutions were prepared by dissolving the desired amount of powder in reaction buffer that had not been pH-adjusted, adjusting the pH to 7.5, and bringing the solution to its final volume in a volumetric flask. The biotin stock was filtered, divided into 1-ml aliquots, and stored at −70 °C. The reaction buffer was composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.50 ± 0.02, at either 20 °C (Ec and Hs) or 40 °C (Ph), 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 500 mm KCl (Ph) or 200 mm KCl (Ec and Hs). PhBPL, EcBPL, and HsBPL were recombinantly expressed and purified from E. coli as previously described (13Ingaramo M. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30862-30870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Brown P.H. Cronan J.E. Grøtli M. Beckett D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Daniels K.G. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5358-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The E. coli biotin acceptor substrate fragment EcBCCP, which comprises the C-terminal 87 amino acids of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase BCCP subunit, was purified as described by Nenortas et al. (14Nenortas E. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All chromatographic steps were carried out on an AKTA prime FPLC platform at 4 °C (GE Healthcare). PhBCCP corresponds to the 73 C-terminal amino acids of P. horikoshii BCCP domain of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and was expressed from a pet11-a plasmid derivative that was a generous gift from RIKEN (18Bagautdinov B. Matsuura Y. Bagautdinova S. Kunishima N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(λDE3)-RIL strain by electroporation, and selection was carried out on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. A 1-ml volume from a 5-ml overnight culture was diluted into 50 ml of LB medium containing antibiotic and grown for 8 h at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. A second 500-ml culture was started by addition of 10 ml of the previous growth and grown overnight. The final four 1-liter cultures were inoculated with the previous culture at a dilution of 1:20. Protein expression was induced at an A600 of 0.7 by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 350 μm, and allowed to proceed for 2.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 rpm at 4 °C for 40 min, the pellet was washed with 40 ml of lysis buffer/liter of culture, and the sample was centrifuged again for 20 min at 9000 rpm. The cell paste was resuspended in twice its weight of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, 500 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF), and cells were disrupted by sonication using 1-min bursts until the A600 decreased to <10% of the original value. The lysate was diluted to 200 ml with lysis buffer and cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 40 min. After adding CaCl2, MgCl2, DNase I, and RNase, to 1 mm, 2.5 mm, and 0.03 mg/ml (both enzymes) final concentrations, respectively, the sample was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The solution was then heated to 90 °C for 15 min with stirring, cooled to room temperature, and the precipitated contaminating proteins were cleared by centrifuging at 9000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. To eliminate residual nucleic acid contamination PEI was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v), the sample was stirred at 4 °C for 15 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. Solid ammonium sulfate was stirred slowly into the supernatant to 90% (w/v) saturation, and precipitation was allowed to proceed overnight. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1.5 h and resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, 5% (v/v) glycerol. This sample was dialyzed against 2 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 5% (v/v) glycerol and loaded on a hydroxyapatite column (Pall Lifesciences). The flow-through was collected, dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, 200 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol), and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Because the PhBCCP does not possess tryptophan or tyrosine residues, the stock concentration was determined by comparing the density of the bands from dilutions electrophoresed on a 20% acrylamide-SDS-Tricine gel against bands with known amounts of PhBCCP(19Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). Lanes with known amounts of PhBCCP were obtained by loading dilutions of a PhBCCP desalted “standard” solution, the concentration of which had been determined in triplicate by quantitative amino acid analysis at the protein facility of the Iowa State University. Band density quantitation was performed using a Molecular Dynamics Laser Scanning Personal Densitometer (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software. The HsBCCP fragment corresponds to the C-terminal 67 amino acids of the BCCP domain of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. To facilitate removal of the histidine tag and eliminate any exogenous residues originating from the vector, the p67 sequence from a pDEST17 derivative (a generous gift from Dr. Roy Gravel) was subcloned into pSUMO-pro (LifeSensors) (20Healy S. Heightman T.D. Hohmann L. Schriemer D. Gravel R.A. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 314-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A tyrosine residue was added at the N terminus to allow for concentration determination using UV absorption spectroscopy. The plasmid encoding the SUMO-HsBCCP fusion was introduced into E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) by electroporation, and transformants were selected by growth on LB agar containing 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A single colony was transferred to 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with antibiotics and grown for 8 h with shaking at 37 °C. A 1:100 dilution was performed to initiate a 50-ml overnight culture, and 1-liter cultures were inoculated with 20 ml of the overnight culture and grown at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced at an A600 of 0.8 by addition of lactose to 0.5% (w/v). Following overnight growth at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 rpm at 4 °C, resuspended in a volume of lysis buffer corresponding to five times the cell pellet weight, and lysed by sonication in HsBCCP lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, 300 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF). The crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to chromatography on 8 ml of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) packed in a 1.5 × 10-cm Econo-Column (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted protein was dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 60 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and digested overnight at room temperature with SUMO-protease-1. To remove the protease, the His6-SUMO tag, and undigested protein, the sample was passed through Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The flow-through was collected and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol. The resulting sample was loaded onto a 8-ml DEAE anion exchange (GE Healthcare) column and eluted with a linear gradient of 20–400 mm KCl (VT = 200 ml) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The pooled fractions (2 ml each) containing HsBCCP were concentrated and loaded at 0.1 ml/min onto a 150-ml S-100 Sephacryl resin (GE Healthcare) packed in a 1.5 × 100-cm Econo-Column and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, 0.8 m KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol. The eluted sample was exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, at 4 °C, 200 mm KCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol by dialysis and stored at −70 °C. The yield was 10 mg of protein per liter of bacterial culture, and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 1450 m cm−1 at 276 nm (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Biotin transfer was measured by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence increase that occurs upon rapid mixing the enzyme-intermediate complex with the substrate biotin acceptor protein (13Ingaramo M. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30862-30870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Nenortas E. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A solution of 1–2 μm ligase was incubated with half its concentration of biotin and 500 μm ATP for 20 min to allow for bio-5′-AMP synthesis. To avoid the complication from the large fluorescence change that accompanies ATP binding to the enzyme, PhBPL-catalyzed reactions were carried out using chemically synthesized bio-5′-AMP (17Daniels K.G. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5358-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Reactions catalyzed by the human and E. coli enzyme were carried out in standard reaction buffer, which contains 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 20 °C, 200 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2. In contrast, those reactions catalyzed by PhBPL were performed at pH 7.5, 40 °C, and a KCl concentration of 500 mm. The higher salt concentration and temperature are necessary to obtain complete activity of the thermophilic enzyme (17Daniels K.G. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5358-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), a reflection of the fact that the P. horikoshii intracellular salt concentration is about 500 mm, and the organism grows optimally at 98 °C (22González J.M. Masuchi Y. Robb F.T. Ammerman J.W. Maeder D.L. Yanagibayashi M. Tamaoka J. Kato C. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Each ligase-intermediate complex solution was rapidly mixed with varying concentrations of BCCP using a Kintek SF-2001 stopped-flow instrument equipped with fluorescence detection. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and fluorescence emission was monitored above 340 nm using a cutoff filter (Corion Corp.). At least six traces spanning 10 half-lives were collected at each BCCP concentration. The resulting transients were fit to an appropriate model (single or double exponential), and the apparent rates were plotted as a function of BCCP concentration. Further analysis and interpretation were performed as described under “Results.” Single turnover measurements of enzyme-catalyzed biotin transfer to the BCCP fragments were monitored as a function of time using a Kintek QF-3 quench-flow apparatus. One syringe contained a solution of 1 μm ligase, 0.463 μm biotin, 37 nm [3H]biotin, and 500 μm ATP that had been incubated for 30 min at the working temperature to allow for bio-5′-AMP synthesis. The second syringe contained variable concentrations of each BCCP fragment, ranging from 10 to 200 μm. All samples were prepared in the appropriate working buffer. Equal volumes of the two syringe solutions were mixed, and the resulting reactions were allowed to age for a specific amount of time, after which they were quenched with a 2 m HCl solution. Free and BCCP-incorporated biotin were separated using TCA precipitation (23Chapman-Smith A. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In reactions containing PhBCCP, 0.02% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate was included, in addition to BSA (0.1 mg/ml), to aid in precipitation. The samples were spotted on dried Whatman 3MM squares to which 200 μl of 800 μm unlabeled biotin had been added after soaking in 10% TCA. After drying, the papers were washed twice in batch mode in 250 ml of ice-cold 10% TCA and once in 100 ml of cold ethanol. The radioactivity retained on the filters was quantified in a LS6500 Beckman counter using ReadyProtein+ (Beckman) scintillation fluid. Background corrections were performed with values obtained from control reactions that contained no BCCP. Correction for precipitation efficiency (typically above 80%) and conversion from dpm to “μm biotin” were carried out using the relation between dpm and μm obtained from the precipitation of a reaction incubated for 30 min to allow for quantitative 3H incorporation. Each discontinuous transient was fit to a single exponential equation, and the resulting apparent rates as a function of BCCP concentration were subjected to linear least squares analysis. The slope of the line yielded the rate of biotin incorporation. Interpretation of kinetic and binding data requires knowledge of the assembly states of all species participating in a reaction. The oligomerization properties of the three biotin protein ligases have previously been characterized using sedimentation equilibrium. The human ligase is monomeric in both its unliganded and liganded forms (13Ingaramo M. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30862-30870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By contrast, the P. horikoshii ligase is a constitutive dimer (17Daniels K.G. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 5358-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, in the dimer the active sites for biotin transfer are available for interaction with the acceptor substrate (3Bagautdinov B. Matsuura Y. Bagautdinova S. Kunishima N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14739-14750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The E. coli enzyme can also form a homodimer, albeit in a reaction that depends on the intermediate in biotin transfer, bio-5′-AMP (24Eisenstein E. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13077-13084Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the surface utilized for the homodimerization is identical to that used for heterodimerization with the biotin acceptor protein (25Weaver L.H. Kwon K. Beckett D. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2618-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constant governing the homodimerization reaction in buffer conditions identical to those used in the present studies is ∼10 μm (24Eisenstein E. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13077-13084Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consequently, to avoid any complication from this competing homodimerization reaction, all kinetic measurements in these studies were performed at a total enzyme concentration of 0.5 μm. The assembly states of the three acceptor protein substrates employed in these studies were also characterized by sedimentation equilibrium. The EcBCCP has previously been shown to be monomeric over a broad concentration range (14Nenortas E. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For this work, sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed on HsBCCP and PhBCCP (data not shown). Global analysis of the data obtained at three loading concentrations and two speeds using a single species model yielded molecular masses for the proteins consistent with monomers. This work is focused on the interaction of the ligase with the biotin acceptor protein in post-translational biotinylation. Because the rate-determining step in the overall reaction is intermediate synthesis, steady-state measurements provide limited information about this protein-protein interaction. However, the reaction proceeds through a double displacement mechanism that can be halted after formation of the kinetically stable ligase-bio-5′-AMP complex (Fig. 1). Mixing of the preformed complex with BCCP allows monitoring of the second half-reaction independent of the first. In these experiments, BPL is preincubated with biotin at half of the enzyme concentration and excess ATP to allow for bio-5′-AMP synthesis. The BPL excess over biotin ensures that only one turnover of biotin transfer occurs in the stopped-flow measurement. Mixing of the preformed complex with BCCP yields a time-dependent increase in the intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 3A) that has been shown through measurements of the spectra of the two species to be consistent with conversion of the bio-5′-AMP-bound enzyme to the free enzyme (13Ingaramo M. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30862-30870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Nenortas E. Beckett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transients acquired upon mixing the ligase-bio-5′-AMP complex at each BCCP concentration were fit to either a single or double exponential model to obtain apparent rates. For example, the transient shown in Fig. 3A, which was obtained by mixing HsBCCP-bio-5′-AMP with 200 μm HsBCCP, contains two well separated exponential phases. Although both the human- and E. coli-catalyzed reactions displayed this biphasic behavior at higher BCCP concentrations, all PhBCCP traces were monophasic. Plots of the faster apparent rate versus biotin-accepting substrate concentration for all three cognate ligase-substrate pairs were linear and showed no evidence of saturation (Fig. 3B). Consequently, the slope of each line is interpreted as reporting on k1, or BCCP association with the ligase-bio-5′-AMP complex, in the following mechanism.BPL−bio−5'−AMP+BCCP⇄k−1k1BPL−bio−5'−AMP−BCCP→k2BPL+bioBCCP+AMPREACTION 1 The bimolecular association rates for the three BPLs with their cognate substrates (Table 1), obtained from linear regression of the apparent rate versus BCCP concentration profiles (Fig. 3B), reveal that all three reactions are characterized by bimolecular association rates on the order of 104 m−1s−1. However, the human system displays the fastest rate.TABLE 1Biotin transfer rates for cognate ligase-BCCP pairsPairStopped-flowaThe errors represent the S.D. of three independent stopped-flow experiments.Quench-flowbThe errors correspond to the S.D. of results obtained in two independent quench-flow experiments.m−1s−1m−1s−1HsBPL35,000 ± 3,00031,000 ± 3,000EcBPL11,500 ± 70010,500 ± 800PhBPL15,000 ± 600cMeasurements with PhBPL were carried out at 40 °C, in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2.
