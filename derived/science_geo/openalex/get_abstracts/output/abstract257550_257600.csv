https://openalex.org/W2040945899,"A palaeoclimate record spanning the past 16,000 years with nearly annual time resolution has been obtained from Lake Huguang Maar in China. The magnetic properties and titanium content of the lake sediments are thought to reflect changes in the East Asian winter monsoon strength, thus providing a complement to palaeoclimate archives that record the strength of the rain-bearing summer monsoon. The records point to an anti-correlation between winter and summer monsoon strength, best explained by migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a belt of low-pressure air at the Equator. Interestingly, the decline of China's Tang dynasty and the Mayan civilization broadly coincide with drought periods recorded in Lake Huguang Maar and Cariaco basin sediments, respectively. Did major shifts in the position of the ITCZ catalyse simultaneous events in civilizations on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean? The Asian–Australian monsoon is an important component of the Earth’s climate system that influences the societal and economic activity of roughly half the world’s population. The past strength of the rain-bearing East Asian summer monsoon can be reconstructed with archives such as cave deposits1,2,3, but the winter monsoon has no such signature in the hydrological cycle and has thus proved difficult to reconstruct. Here we present high-resolution records of the magnetic properties and the titanium content of the sediments of Lake Huguang Maar in coastal southeast China over the past 16,000 years, which we use as proxies for the strength of the winter monsoon winds. We find evidence for stronger winter monsoon winds before the Bølling–Allerød warming, during the Younger Dryas episode and during the middle and late Holocene, when cave stalagmites suggest weaker summer monsoons1,2,3. We conclude that this anticorrelation is best explained by migrations in the intertropical convergence zone. Similar migrations of the intertropical convergence zone have been observed in Central America for the period ad 700 to 900 (refs 4–6), suggesting global climatic changes at that time. From the coincidence in timing, we suggest that these migrations in the tropical rain belt could have contributed to the declines of both the Tang dynasty in China and the Classic Maya in Central America."

If recalling a memory is a biological equivalent of replaying a video, the brain is a poor video recorder. That might be for the best, though. In a revival of our Essays strand, Daniel Schacter and Donna Rose Addis reflect on the nature of 'constructive memory', which allows us to remember something that didn't happen. They suggest that memory works by piecing together bits of the past from scattered components. Not ideal for a video recorder, but it may allow us to simulate future events in a way that better equips us for the world."

Novel antiviral cytokines IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2, and IFN-λ3 are classified as type III IFNs and have evolved independently of type I IFNs. Type III IFN genes are regulated at the level of transcription and induced by viral infection. Although the regulatory mechanism of type I IFNs is well elucidated, the expression mechanism of IFN-λs is not well understood. Here, we analyzed the mechanism by which IFN-λ gene expression is induced by viral infections. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed the involvement of RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), IPS-1, TBK1, and interferon regulatory factor-3, key regulators of the virus-induced activation of type I IFN genes. Consistent with this, a search for the cis-regulatory element of the human ifnλ1 revealed a cluster of interferon regulatory factor-binding sites and a NF-κB-binding site. Functional analysis demonstrated that all of these sites are essential for gene activation by the virus.

Viral infections trigger the activation of type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β). The mechanism behind the virus-induced expression of type I IFNs is well documented (3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar, 4Honda K. Yanai H. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Plasmacytoid-dendritic cells, which are responsible for a high level of IFN-α in serum, detect virus-associated molecular patterns via Toll-like receptor-7 or -9 receptors. The signal is transduced to IRAK1/IRAK4/IKK-α kinases in a MyD88-dependent manner resulting in the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) through its specific phosphorylation. In other cells, extracellular double-stranded RNA is detected by Toll-like receptor-3, transducing a signal through the TRIF/TICAM-1 adaptor in a MyD88-independent manner and then activating TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or IκB kinase I (IKK-i) kinase and subsequently IRF-3 through its phosphorylation. The third class of receptors for virus-associated molecular patterns resides in the cytoplasm and detects replicating viral RNA. The retinoic acid inducible-gene I (RIG-I) family of RNA helicases are shown to recognize viral double-stranded RNA by their helicase domain and transmit signals to downstream molecules via their caspase recruitment domain (CARD) (5Yoneyama M.

Although the precise mechanism involved has not been elucidated, IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), a mitochondrial protein containing CARD, is thought to further transmit the signal to IRF-3 kinases, TBK1, and IKK-i (7Kawai T.

Recently, a study using mice with disrupted genes for key molecules of the three different pathways of type I IFN gene activation was reported (11Gitlin L. Barchet W. Gilfillan S. Cella M. Beutler B.

Nature. 2006; 441: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RIG-I family helicases RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 play key protective roles in infections of Japanese encephalitis virus and encephalomyelitis virus, respectively. It appeared that disruption of either of the Toll-like receptor pathways did not have a strong effect on protection against these viruses, suggesting a central role for the RIG-I family in host protection in vivo. In recent years, several novel interleukin-10-related cytokines have been identified (13Kotenko S.V. Gallagher G. Baurin V.V. Lewis-Antes A. Shen M. Shah N.K. Langer J.A. Sheikh F. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, 14Pestka S. Krause C.D. Sarkar D. Walter M.R. Shi Y. Fisher P.B. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Although IFN-λs, a family of interleukin-10-related cytokines, are evolutionarily distantly related to type I IFNs, they exhibit antiviral activity similar to type I IFNs. Thus, they are collectively known as type III IFNs. Type III IFNs interact with cell surface receptors composed of interleukin-10 receptor β and interleukin-28 receptor α, distinct from those for types I or II IFNs. The binding of a type III IFN to its receptor results in the intracellular activation of Janus kinase 1 and signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT1 and STAT2 and then the subsequent formation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex. Similar to type I IFNs, type III IFNs are induced to express by viral infection or treatment with poly(I·C) or lipopolysaccharide (16Coccia E.M. Severa M. Giacomini E. Monneron D. Remoli M.E. Julkunen I. Cella M. Lande R. Uze G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms involved are not well understood. Here we analyzed how type III IFN genes are regulated by viral infections. We took advantage of a comparative approach using the well established molecular mechanism regulating type I IFN genes. We looked at the effect of loss and gain of function of the signaling molecules critical for type I IFN genes. We mapped and analyzed cis-regulatory elements that function as virus-inducible enhancers. Our results demonstrate a central role for a pathway involving RIG-I, IRF-3, and NF-κB. Cell Culture, Transfection, Preparation of Cell Extracts, and Luciferase Assay—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. L929 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. 293T and L929 cells were transiently transfected with the calcium-phosphate method and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), respectively. For the preparation of cell extracts, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and centrifuged at 245,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for immunoblotting. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used for luciferase assays. As an internal control for the Dual-Luciferase assay, the Renilla luciferase construct pRL-TK (Promega) was used. Plasmid Constructs—We used pEF-FLAG-IRF-3 5D and pEF-FLAG-RIG-I CARD as described previously (6Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar, 17Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). IPS-1 cDNA was purchased from the Biological Resource Center of the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan. We amplified this cDNA with an oligonucleotide for the N-terminal FLAG tag by PCR and inserted it into the XbaI-SpeI site of pEF-BOS(+) (pEF-FLAG-IPS-1). The promoter region of human ifnλ1 was amplified by genomic PCR (upper primer, 5′-CTAGGTCGACGGGCAACAAGAGCAAAACTA-3′, lower primer, 5′-GTGGATCCGCTAAATCGCAACTGCTTCC-3′), and the PCR fragment was inserted into the SalI-BamHI site of luciferase vector (pλ1-(-554/+14)Luc). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed with the BigDye DNA sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). We chemically synthesized fragments encompassing the promoter sequence of the ifnλ1 between -225 and -36 and inserted them into the SalI-BamHI site of p-55Luc (p-55λ1-(-225/-36)Luc). Synthesized fragments of p-55λ1mut.IRF-Luc, p-55λ1mut. NF-κBLuc, and p-55λ1mut.IRF/mut. NF-κBLuc were designed as shown in Fig. 4A and inserted into the SalI-BamHI site of p-55Luc. Quantitative Real Time-PCR—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), treated with DNase I (Roche Diagnostics), and amplified by real time-PCR with the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Taq-Man reverse transcription reagents and the TaqMan Universal PCR mix (Applied Biosystems) were used for cDNA synthesis and PCR, respectively. We used commercial TaqMan primerprobe sets (Applied Biosystems) for mouse ifnλ2, human ifnλ1, and human ifnλ2. As an internal control for the comparative threshold cycle method, a primer-probe set for eukaryotic 18 S rRNA (Applied Biosystems) was used. The results were normalized to the abundance of internal 18 S rRNA and were reproducibly obtained in two independent transfection experiments. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—RACE analysis was performed using the FirstChoice RNA ligase-mediated RACE (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was prepared as for quantitative real time-PCR. Nested PCR reaction was performed using recombinant TaqDNA polymerase (TaKaRa), ifnλ1-specific outer primer (5′-GGCCACATATTTGAGGTCTC-3′), and ifnλ1-specific inner primer (5′-CGCGGATCCAGAAGCCTCAGGTCCCAATT-3′) according to the manufacturer. The RACE product was cloned into pBluescript II vector, and 10 random clones were sequenced. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The oligonucleotides containing self-complementary sequences for NF-κB(5′-GGGAAATTCTCTTAGCTTGAGAATTTCC-3′) or mutated NF-κB(5′-GCCGAATTCTCTTAGCTTGAGAATTCGG-3′) of human ifnλ1 were used as a probe. The method for EMSA was described previously (18Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). We used commercial anti-NF-κB antibodies for human p50, p65, and IRF-3 (IBL; catalog numbers 18661, 18667, and 18781, respectively). The Effect of Loss of Function of IRF-3, TBK1, and RIG-I on Virus-induced Activation of ifnλ2—It has been reported that the expression of IFN-λ is induced by stimuli such as viral infections and treatment with poly(I·C) or lipopolysaccharide in a parallel fashion to that of type I IFN genes (16Coccia E.M. Severa M. Giacomini E. Monneron D. Remoli M.E. Julkunen I. Cella M. Lande R. Uze G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of the transcription factor IRF-3 and its regulatory kinase, TBK1, using MEFs derived from respective knock-out mice (19Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 20Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Because mice have no ortholog gene of the human ifnλ1, we examined the expression level of the mouse ifnλ2. MEFs were mock-treated or infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and the endogenous mouse ifnλ2 mRNA level was determined by quantitative real time-PCR. Although a significant level of expression of the mouse ifnλ2 gene was observed in NDV-infected wild-type cells, IRF-3-/- cells were totally deficient in ifnλ2 (Fig. 1A). TBK1-/- cells exhibited a significantly suppressed expression of the ifnλ2 (Fig. 1B). The residual induction is likely due to IKK-i (IKK-ε). Viral infections are shown to activate type I IFN genes through the activation of the RNA helicase RIG-I, which acts as a sensor for replicating viral RNA in cells (6Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar, 21Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Matsui K. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunity. 2005; 23: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). We investigated the involvement of RIG-I in the NDV-induced activation of the ifnλ2 by using RIG-I knock-out MEFs. As shown in Fig. 1C, RIG-I-deficient cells failed to activate the ifnλ2, suggesting RIG-I is critical for this signaling. Essentially the same result was obtained in small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown experiments using transformed mouse L929 cells (data not shown). We do not know the reason why gene expression levels somehow vary between +/+ cells. Although the genetic background of the mice is the same, MEFs were prepared at different embryonic stages for IRF-3, TBK1, and RIG-I knockouts. To compare the effect of knock-out, each wild-type/knock-out pair was prepared at the same embryonic stage or from littermates. Also, cell culture histories are different between different gene knockouts but are identical between each wild-type/knockout pair. Thus, comparison is best made between each +/+ and -/-. Gain of Function of IRF-3 and RIG-I Results in the Activation of Human IFN-λ Genes—As an alternative approach, we expressed dominant active mutants of IRF-3 and RIG-I in 293T cells and monitored endogenous human ifnλ1 and ifnλ2 mRNA by quantitative real time-PCR. IRF-3 5D is a mutant with five Ser/Thr residues replaced with Asp. IRF-3 5D is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser-386 by some unknown kinase(s) in human cells and is capable of activating targets including type I IFN genes (17Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a deletion mutant of RIG-I, which contains CARD alone (RIG-I CARD, Fig. 2A), results in the constitutive activation of type I IFN genes (6Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of constitutively active IRF-3 and RIG-I in 293T cells (Fig. 2B) resulted in the constitutive activation of human ifnλ1 and ifnλ2 (Fig. 2, C and D). These results strongly suggest that IFN-λ genes are regulated by a mechanism common to type I IFN. IFN-λ Genes are Regulated by IPS-1-mediated Signaling—Recently, IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, VISA, or Cardif) was identified as an adaptor molecule of RIG-I signaling (7Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar, 8Meylan E. Curran J. Hofmann K. Moradpour D. Binder M. Barten-schlager R. Tschopp J. Nature. 2005; 437: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar, 9Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar, 10Xu L.G. Wang Y.Y. Han K.J. Li L.Y. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that activated RIG-I interacts with IPS-1 between respective CARD domains, resulting in the activation of IRF-3, NF-κB, and type I IFN genes. Interestingly, overexpression of full-length IPS-1 can induce the expression of type I IFN genes without a viral infection. We therefore expressed full-length IPS-1 in 293T cells (Fig. 2B) and monitored human ifnλ1 and ifnλ2 mRNA. Transfection of the IPS-1-encoding vector but not empty vector induced the expression of endogenous human ifnλ1 and ifnλ2 (Fig. 2, E and F), suggesting that IFN-λ genes are regulated by IPS-1-mediated signaling, the major pathway triggered by viral replication. Identification of the Transcription Initiation Site of the Human ifnλ1—The above results suggest the presence of one or more virus-inducible enhancer elements within the IFN-λ genes. To identify these elements, the transcription initiation site(s) of human ifnλ1 was investigated by RACE. The RACE product was exclusively detected with NDV-infected RNA (Fig. 3A). The product was subcloned and sequenced. A random 10 clones had identical 5′ ends as shown in Fig. 3B. There was no TATA-like sequence at the expected position, thus we conclude that ifnλ1 is a TATA-less gene. Identification of the cis-Acting Regulatory Element of the Human ifnλ1—Next, we analyzed virus-inducible enhancer elements within the ifnλ1. We isolated the HeLa cell genomic fragment encompassing the human ifnλ1 -554 to +14 relative to the transcription initiation site (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 4A). The fragment was cloned into a firefly luciferase reporter gene (pλ1-(-554/+14)Luc) (Fig. 4A). For comparison, a reporter containing eight tandem repeats of the IRF-binding motif (p-55C1BLuc) (Fig. 4A, bottom) was used. Although p-55C1BLuc was significantly activated by IFN-β treatment, pλ1-(-554/+14)Luc was not significantly affected by IFN-β treatment, consistent with the observation that IFN-λ is barely inducible (1/1000 of viral induction) by type I IFN per se (Fig. 4B) (22Ank N. West H. Bartholdy C. Eriksson K. Thomsen A.R. Paludan S.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4501-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In contrast, NDV infection strongly induced the activation of both p-55C1BLuc and pλ1-(-554/+14)Luc, showing that the isolated genomic fragment contains a virus-inducible enhancer (Fig. 4C). Critical Function of IRF and NF-κB-binding Sites within the ifnλ1 Enhancer—Within the above fragment, we noted putative binding sites for IRF (-214 to -172) and NF-κB(-98 to -89) (Fig. 4A). It is worth noting that multiple IRF-binding sites and a NF-κB motif exist similar to the ifnβ enhancer. Also, corresponding motifs were found in the human ifnλ2 (Fig. 4A, right). To examine the function of these motifs, we chemically synthesized the region (-225 to -36) of human ifnλ1 and cloned it into the upstream of the basal promoter of human ifnβ fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene (p-55Luc (18Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar)). Fig. 4E shows that the synthetic fragment functions as a virus-inducible cis-element, suggesting that the synthetic fragment encompasses the regulatory element. Disruption of the binding sites for either IRF or NF-κB reduced the level of virus-induced gene expression, and simultaneous disruption of these binding sites resulted in further impaired viral induction (Fig. 4, D and E). These results indicate that these binding sites function as components of a virus-inducible enhancer. NF-κB Binds to the NF-κB Motif of ifnλ1—The above reporter assay suggested that the NF-κB motif is critical for IFN-λ gene induction. We tested NF-κB binding to the motif by EMSA (Fig. 5). NDV infection specifically induced binding activity to the wild-type but not to the mutated probe, suggesting that the motif is a functional NF-κB site (Fig. 5A). In addition, anti-p50 or -p65 antibody blocked the specific complex (Fig. 5B), suggesting that p50/p65 heterodimer binds to the ifnλ1 NF-κB site. The type I and III IFNs exhibit little structural conservation and are thought to have different origins. Indeed, types I and III IFNs elicit biological effects through interaction with distinct cell surface receptors. We found that, irrespective of their evolutional origin, IFN-λ genes are regulated by a mechanism common to type I IFNs. Our loss-of-function analyses revealed the involvement of IRF-3, TBK1, and RIG-I. Ectopic activation of IRF-3, RIG-I, and IPS-1 all activated type III IFN genes. These signaling molecules play a critical role in the virus-induced activation of type I IFN genes. Our search for a cis-element in the promoter of the human ifnλ1 revealed a cluster of IRF-binding sites and a NF-κB-binding site as components of the virus-inducible enhancer. This is reminiscent of type I IFN enhancers, because multiple IRF sites critically regulate virus-inducible enhancers of IFN-α and -β, and a single κB site plays a critical role in the activation of IFN-β. Although IRF sites are potentially subject to regulation by IFN through IFN-stimulated gene factor 3, the expression of types I or III genes is little induced by IFN treatment per se. Thus, the common expression patterns of types I and III IFN genes are determined by the arrangements of these transcription factor-binding sites, which may be independently acquired through the evolution of the respective genes. Consistent with our finding, Osterlund et al. (23Osterlund P. Veckman V. Siren J. Klucher K.M. Hiscott J. Mati-kainen S. Julkunen I. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9608-9617Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) report that IRF-3 binds to the IRF site predicted by a DNA affinitybinding assay. They also report the binding of NF-κBtothe promoter region (at nucleotide position -264 to -256 from the transcription initiator site); however, removal of the predicted binding site did not affect the enhancer activity. 3K. Onoguchi and T. Fujita, unpublished data. Instead, disruption of the other proximal NF-κB site (-98 to -89) significantly reduced the enhancer activity. Disruption of both IRF and NF-κB sites significantly reduced the transcriptional activity, but the mutant promoter exhibited weak activation, suggesting that unidentified cis-elements exist within the DNA fragment. In addition, they reported differential activation of ifnλ1 and ifnλ2. Influenza A virus induces the expression of ifnλ1 (but not ifnλ2), although Sendai virus induced production of high levels of both ifnλ1 and ifnλ2. It is worth noting that, although putative binding sites for IRF and NF-κB are found in the promoter region of the ifnλ2 (Fig. 4A, right), DNA sequence conservation to that of ifnλ1 is low. Detailed analyses are necessary to elucidate the mechanism behind the virus-specific activation of type III IFN genes. Because of the use of distinct receptors, types I and III IFNs likely do not signal identical biological outcomes in anti-viral and anti-cancer activities. Type I IFNs have been used to treat viral infections and certain cancers. The present study will help to establish a new strategy using IFN inducers. Developing inducers that commonly or differentially regulate types I and III IFN genes may enable us to manipulate the IFN system for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2095579742,"Wilms tumor is a pediatric kidney cancer associated with inactivation of the WT1 tumor-suppressor gene in 5 to 10% of cases. Using a high-resolution screen for DNA copy-number alterations in Wilms tumor, we identified somatic deletions targeting a previously uncharacterized gene on the X chromosome. This gene, which we call WTX , is inactivated in approximately one-third of Wilms tumors (15 of 51 tumors). Tumors with mutations in WTX lack WT1 mutations, and both genes share a restricted temporal and spatial expression pattern in normal renal precursors. In contrast to biallelic inactivation of autosomal tumor-suppressor genes, WTX is inactivated by a monoallelic “single-hit” event targeting the single X chromosome in tumors from males and the active X chromosome in tumors from females."

https://openalex.org/W2033427105,"Theories predict that collisions between some of the many thousands of stars packed into globular clusters should lead to the formation of massive black holes. No such black holes had been observed, so perhaps a rival theory, that stellar jostling would eject most or all black holes from the clusters has it right? The discovery of the X-ray signature of a black hole in a globular cluster associated with the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4472 in Virgo provides part of the answer, and by studying its properties it should be possible to establish the prospects for other black holes in similar situations. A report of the X-ray signature of an accreting black hole in a globular star cluster associated with the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4472. Globular star clusters contain thousands to millions of old stars packed within a region only tens of light years across. Their high stellar densities make it very probable that their member stars will interact or collide. There has accordingly been considerable debate about whether black holes should exist in these star clusters1,2,3. Some theoretical work suggests that dynamical processes in the densest inner regions of globular clusters may lead to the formation of black holes of ∼1,000 solar masses3. Other numerical simulations instead predict that stellar interactions will eject most or all of the black holes that form in globular clusters1,2. Here we report the X-ray signature of an accreting black hole in a globular cluster associated with the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4472 (in the Virgo cluster). This object has an X-ray luminosity of about 4 × 1039 erg s-1, which rules out any object other than a black hole in such an old stellar population. The X-ray luminosity varies by a factor of seven in a few hours, which excludes the possibility that the object is several neutron stars superposed."

https://openalex.org/W1969066867,"The androgen-androgen receptor (AR) system plays vital roles in a wide array of biological processes, including prostate cancer development and progression. Several growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), can induce AR activation, whereas insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are correlated with an elevated incidence of prostate cancer. Here we report that Foxo1, a downstream molecule that becomes phosphorylated and inactivated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase in response to IGF1 or insulin, suppresses ligand-mediated AR transactivation. Foxo1 reduces androgen-induced AR target gene expressions and suppresses the in vitro growth of prostate cancer cells. These inhibitory effects of Foxo1 are attenuated by IGF1 but are enhanced when it is rendered Akt-nonphosphorylatable. Foxo1 interacts directly with the C terminus of AR in a ligand-dependent manner and disrupts ligand-induced AR subnuclear compartmentalization. Foxo1 is recruited by liganded AR to the chromatin of AR target gene promoters, where it interferes with AR-DNA interactions. IGF1 or insulin abolish the Foxo1 occupancy of these promoters. Of interest, a positive feedback circuit working locally in an autocrine/intracrine manner may exist, because liganded AR up-regulates IGF1 receptor expression in prostate cancer cells, presumably resulting in higher IGF1 signaling tension and further enhancing the functions of the receptor itself. Thus, Foxo1 is a novel corepressor for AR, and IGF1/insulin signaling may confer stimulatory effects on AR by attenuating Foxo1 inhibition. These results highlight the potential involvement of metabolic syndrome and hyperinsulinemia in prostate diseases and further suggest that intervention of IGF1/insulin-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling may be of clinical value for prostate diseases.

The androgen-AR system mediates male sexual differentiation in the uterus, sperm production at puberty, prostate development in the adult, and primary prostate cancer (PC) growth in patients with PC (1Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Adv. Pharmacol. 2004; 47: 317-341Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PC is the most common malignancy in men worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States (2Greenlee R.T. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA-Cancer. J. Clin. 2000; 50: 7-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The fact that over 70% of PCs rely on androgen stimulation for growth sets the basis for androgen ablation therapy, which is initially effective but invariably results in treatment resistance after a period of time (3Santos A.F. Huang H. Tindall D.J. Steroids. 2004; 69: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The disease is then referred to as androgen-independent PC and progresses to a fatal outcome. Recent loss-of-function studies have revealed that AR still plays a key role in hormone-refractory progression of PC (4Zegarra-Moro O.L. Schmidt L.J. Huang H. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1008-1013PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R. Rosenfeld M.G. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). An adaptation of AR signaling in order to function under low or absent androgen levels may occur (6Buchanan G. Irvine R.A. Coetzee G.A. Tilley W.D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2001; 20: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Among the various suggested mechanisms by which AR may be reactivated in a low androgen environment (7Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), signaling by growth factors, especially insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), is reportedly of significant importance (8Pollak M.

A. 1996; 93: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also revealed that high serum insulin levels are associated with an increased incidence of PC (14Amling C.L. Curr. Opin. Urol. 2005; 15: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Hsing A.W. Gao Y.T. Chua Jr., S. Deng J. Stanczyk F.Z. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), although there is a lack of mechanistic studies implicating insulin signaling in the regulation of AR function. Foxo1, also known as FKHR, together with other two homologs, FKHRL1 and AFX, belong to the Foxo subfamily of the forkhead transcription factor family, which includes a large array of transcription factors characterized by the presence of a conserved 110-amino acid winged helix DNA-binding domain (16Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Foxo subfamily members play important roles in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, as well as in metabolic homeostasis (17Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, which is activated by both liganded IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and insulin receptor, phosphorylates each of the Foxo proteins at three different Ser/Thr residues (17Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Foxo proteins become inactive and are exported from the nucleus. Subsequently, they become sequestered in the cytoplasm, where they interact with 14-3-3 protein. In this study, we observe that Foxo1, which is endogenously expressed in PC cells, can interact with AR via the C terminus of the receptor in a ligand-dependent manner and suppress ligand-induced AR transactivation. Foxo1 impaired AR signaling by interfering with ligand-induced AR nuclear translocation and subnuclear compartmentalization as well as receptor-target gene promoter interactions. Furthermore, IGF1/insulin-PI3K/Akt pathway-induced phosphorylation of Foxo1 ameliorated the suppression. Intriguingly, liganded AR stimulated IGF1R expression, suggesting the presence of local positive feedback between IGF1 and AR signaling in PC cells.

Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as means ± S.D. and evaluated by Student's two-tailed t test or ANOVA, followed by post hoc comparisons with Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Foxo1 Represses Ligand-induced AR Transactivation and Delays LNCaP Cell Proliferation—Initially, the effects of Foxo1 on the transactivation induced by ligand-bound AR were investigated using relative luciferase activity assays. COS7 cells were cotransfected with pCMV-hAR and an artificial luciferase reporter for AR (pGL3-MMTV) together with increasing doses of a Foxo1 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 1a, Foxo1 inhibited agonist-induced transcription from the MMTV promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the transactivation of endogenous AR monitored by the MMTV promoter in LNCaP human PC cells was suppressed by Foxo1 in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 1a). Foxo1 also inhibited liganded AR-mediated expression of the promoter of a native AR target gene, PSA, in both COS7 (supplemental Fig. 1b) and DU145 (supplemental Fig. 1c) human PC cells. Thus, the inhibitory effect of Foxo1 on AR, either exogenous or endogenous, is not limited to one cell line and/or promoter. Endogenous Foxo1 mRNA was readily detectable by RT-PCR in all four PC cell lines, namely ALVA41, DU145, LNCaP, and PC3 cells, with DU145 and LNCaP cells showing 2-fold higher expression levels than PC3 and ALVA41 cells (supplemental Fig. 1d). To further explore the relevance of the inhibitory effects of Foxo1 on AR observed in the promoter assays, the androgen-mediated endogenous PSA expression levels were studied in LNCaP cells stably expressing either FLAG-Foxo1 or the control FLAG tag. As shown in Fig. 1, b and c, DHT-stimulated PSA expression, which was dose-dependent in terms of both the mRNA level (assayed by real time PCR) and the amount of protein secreted into the medium (quantified by EIA), was significantly lower in cells overexpressing Foxo1, indicating that Foxo1 down-regulates the expressions of endogenous androgen-responsive genes. Lentivirus was applied as an additional method for overexpressing Foxo1 in LNCaP cells, and similar results were obtained (supplemental Fig. 1e). Foxo1 also acted on other steroid hormone receptors (supplemental Fig. 2). Specifically, it enhanced the transcription mediated by liganded PR-A, PR-B, and GRα, exhibited no dramatic effect on ERα, but suppressed ERβ function in a similar manner to that observed for AR. Thus, the inhibitory effects are relatively specific for AR and ERβ. LNCaP cells are typical androgen-responsive PC cells, and their proliferation is largely dependent on the availability of androgen as well as functional AR. To study the effects of Foxo1 on LNCaP cell growth, the two cell lines stably expressing either FLAG-Foxo1 or the control FLAG tag were grown in medium containing charcoal-stripped serum supplemented with either DHT (10-8 m) or vehicle (ethanol), and a time course experiment was performed. Among the cells grown in the presence of DHT, the number of FLAG-Foxo1-expressing cells was decreased compared with control cells, even after 1 day of treatment, and then continued to decrease in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1d). The basal proliferation in the presence of ethanol was also reduced to some extent in the stable FLAG-Foxo1-expressing cells, but more prominent inhibition was observed in cells treated with DHT. Thus, Foxo1 overexpression reduced the proliferation of LNCaP cells. IGF1 Ameliorates Foxo1 Suppression over AR Transactivation— Foxo1 protein is a target of Akt kinase and negatively regulated by phosphorylation in an insulin- and/or IGF1-dependent manner, with resultant nuclear exportation and cytoplasmic sequestration. Therefore, either IGF1 or insulin is expected to attenuate the inhibitory effects of Foxo1 on AR. Initially, we observed that a constitutively active mutant, Foxo1-3A (nonphosphorylatable mutant with all three Akt target residues mutated to alanine, specifically T24A, S253A, and S316A), was more potent than Foxo1 at suppressing DHT-induced AR transactivation (Fig. 2) in LNCaP cells, in which the impaired PI3K/Akt signaling was rescued by cotransfection of PTEN (LNCaP cells lack functional PTEN, and their Akt is constitutively active (27Xin L. Teitell M.A. Lawson D.A. Kwon A. Mellinghoff I.K. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28McMenamin M.E. Soung P. Perera S. Kaplan I. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4291-4296PubMed Google Scholar)). In these PTEN-expressing LNCaP cells, IGF1 significantly augmented liganded AR-mediated PSA promoter activities. Of importance, the IGF1-augmented DHT-induced AR transactivation was sharply suppressed by Foxo1-3A but not by wild-type Foxo1. In other words, IGF1 abolished the suppression of liganded AR by wild-type Foxo1 but not that mediated by the Akt-nonphosphorylatable Foxo1 mutant. The rescue by IGF1 was dose-dependent (supplemental Fig. 3a) and also found in DU145 cells, which contain intact PTEN and PI3K/Akt signaling (supplemental Fig. 3c). Intriguingly, insulin, another PI3K/Akt stimulator, also enhanced the DHT-induced AR transactivation in the PTEN-expressing LNCaP cells in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit less potently (supplemental Fig. 3b). To exclude the possibility that Foxo1 inhibits AR transactivation by decreasing the protein level of the receptor, the AR protein level was examined by immunoblotting under the same conditions used for the reporter assays. As shown in supplemental Fig. 4, a–c, cotransfection of Foxo1 with AR into LNCaP cells did not alter the AR protein level in either the presence or absence of DHT. Similarly, the AR mRNA expression level in lentiviral Foxo1-infected LNCaP cells was not significantly altered (supplemental Fig. 4d). Hence, these data indicate that Foxo1 suppresses the specific activity of the receptor. Physical Interaction between Foxo1 and AR—Next, we examined whether there is a direct physical interaction between AR and Foxo1 by using coimmunoprecipitation assays. LNCaP cells cotransfected with FLAG-Foxo1 and pCMV-hAR together with PTEN and grown in serum-free medium were treated with IGF1, insulin, or PBS in combination with DHT or ethanol. As shown in Fig. 3a (upper panel), FLAG-Foxo1 bands were detected in anti-AR antibody-precipitated immune complexes from cells treated with DHT (lanes 6–8), whereas a very weak signal was detected in ethanol-treated cells (lane 2), suggesting that Foxo1 and AR interact directly, and their interaction is significantly enhanced by the AR ligand. The presence of IGF1 or insulin did not abolish the interaction (Fig. 3a (upper panel), lanes 7 and 8), although both molecules appeared to reduce the amount of Foxo1 protein interacting with liganded AR. In contrast, no Foxo1 signal was detectable in normal rabbit IgG-precipitated immune complexes from cells treated with either ethanol (Fig. 3a (upper panel), lane 1) or DHT (lane 5), indicating the specificity of the Foxo1-AR interaction. Using PTEN-expressing LNCaP cells, we further verified that endogenous AR and Foxo1 interacted in an androgen-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 5), suggesting that the observed interaction is physiologically meaningful and that Foxo1 may repress liganded activated AR via a direct protein-protein interaction. The interaction was further confirmed by modified mammalian one-hybrid assays (29Liao G. Chen L.Y. Zhang A. Godavarthy A. Xia F. Ghosh J.C. Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5052-5061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were cotransfected with an MMTV reporter and AR together with wild-type Foxo1, pACT-Foxo1, or both, and then treated with DHT or two antiandrogens, namely hydroxyflutamide and casodex. As shown in Fig. 3b, FLAG-Foxo1 inhibited DHT-induced AR transactivation as expected. However, pACT-Foxo1 (with a viral VP16 activation domain fused to the Foxo1 N terminus) enhanced the liganded AR function, and the coexistence of FLAG-Foxo1 and pACT-Foxo1 neutralized the luciferase activity. Thus, although Foxo1 was suppressive toward AR, VP16-Foxo1 became an artificial coactivator for AR, and this remarkable shift strongly suggests that there is a direct interaction between AR and Foxo1. Interestingly, the antiandrogens casodex and hydroxyflutamide did not produce the same phenomenon, suggesting that only an agonist can induce the interaction. Further clarification of the individual domains of AR responsible for the interaction with Foxo1 was carried out by mammalian two-hybrid assays, in which the AR N terminus (amino acids 1–660) and C terminus (amino acids 615–919) were individually fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 to produce pBIND-AR-N and pBIND-AR-C, respectively. As a control, the full-length Foxo1 cDNA was fused to the VP16 activation domain in either the forward (pACT-Foxo1-F) or reverse orientation (pACT-Foxo1-R). In comparison with pACT-Foxo1-R, pACT-Foxo1-F did not alter the activity of the pG5-LUC reporter coexpression with pBIND-AR-N in either the presence or absence of the ligand, suggesting a lack of interaction between the AR N terminus and Foxo1 (Fig. 3c). In the case of pBIND-AR-C coexpression, pACT-Foxo1-F, but not pACT-Foxo1-R, significantly stimulated the reporter in the presence of DHT (Fig. 3d). These data indicate that the AR C terminus interacts with Foxo1 in a hormone-dependent manner. Subcellular Interactions between Foxo1 and AR in Living Cells—The intracellular distribution of EYFP-Foxo1 in living COS7 cells was visualized using laser confocal scanning microscopy. Consistent with previous observations (17Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), EYFP-Foxo1 in serum-starved COS7 cells was predominantly located in the nucleus in a homogeneous manner, with relatively weak diffuse fluorescence also visible in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4a). However, the nuclear accumulation of Foxo1 varied among the examined cells (supplemental Fig. 6, a–c). This variation was presumably because of differing IGF1/insulin signaling tones among the different cells, because challenge with IGF1 caused 100% of the EYFP-Foxo1-expressing cells to show complete cytoplasmic fluorescence (Fig. 4b). As expected, EGFP-AR predominantly showed diffuse fluorescence in the cytosol with very weak nuclear fluorescence in the absence of the ligand (Fig. 4c), whereas DHT induced complete nuclear translocation and typical subnuclear foci formation (Fig. 4d). When EYFP-Foxo1 and EGFP-AR were coexpressed, both proteins showed their original distribution patterns in cells treated with the control solvents (IGF1-/DHT-; Fig. 4f). Among the cells treated with DHT alone (IGF1-/DHT-; Fig. 4g), the distribution of EYFP-Foxo1 remained almost unchanged, whereas EGFP-AR exhibited incomplete nuclear translocation and significantly impaired subnuclear compartmentalization (foci formation) and was diffuse in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Although a subgroup of cells showed relatively complete nuclear translocation, their foci formation was apparently impaired (supplemental Fig. 6d). In cells treated with IGF1 alone (IGF1+/DHT-; Fig. 4i), EYFP-Foxo1 was completely exported to the cytoplasm, whereas EGFP-AR maintained its original distribution, namely predominant diffuse cytoplasmic localization with weak nuclear fluorescence. In comparison with IGF1-/DHT+ cells (Fig. 4g), EGFP-AR in cells treated with both ligands (IGF1+/DHT+; Fig. 4j) showed more complete nuclear translocation and, importantly, also exhibited significantly improved subnuclear compartmentalization. To quantitatively evaluate the effects of IGF1/Foxo1 on the subnuclear distribution of liganded AR, the intranuclear distribution patterns of EGFP-AR in the cell populations, shown representatively in Fig. 4, d, g, and j, were subjected to line scan analyses using the LSM software as described previously (22Fan W. Yanase T. Wu Y. Kawate H. Saitoh M. Oba K. Nomura M. Okabe T. Goto K. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Takayanagi R. Nawata H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4, e, h, and k show the line scan data of d, g, and j, respectively. In total, 20 cells from each group were subjected to the line scan analyses. The fluorescence intensity of the cells in Fig. 4d was quite heterogeneous (heterogeneity index (HI) = 53.12 ± 10.53), whereas cotransfection of Foxo1 (cells in Fig. 4g) decreased the HI to 17.83 ± 9.46, indicating that the AR distribution in these cells was quite constant. The HI value recovered to 35.16 ± 18.89 in cells further treated with IGF1 (cells in Fig. 4j), suggesting that the Foxo1-inhibited subnuclear reorganization of liganded AR was partially rescued by IGF1. 3T3-L1 cells contain a relatively high quantity of endogenous AR, which undergoes typical subnuclear reorganization and forms fine foci in the presence of DHT (23Wu Y. Kawate H. Ohnaka K. Nawata H. Takayanagi R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6633-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To address whether Foxo1 also suppresses the foci formation of endogenous AR, EYFP-Foxo1 was expressed in 3T3-L1 cells, and the endogenous AR distributions in the presence and absence of DHT were studied by immunofluorescence staining. As shown in supplemental Fig. 7, DHT-induced AR foci were significantly suppressed by Foxo1 overexpression. Specifically, the HI of liganded nuclear AR was 66"

The plexins are high affinity receptors for the semaphorins and are responsible for initiation of signaling upon ligation. Emerging evidence indicates that many human cancers overexpress Semaphorin 4D, which promotes neovascularization upon stimulating its receptor, Plexin-B1, on endothelial cells. However, to exert its pro-angiogenic functions, Semaphorin 4D must be processed and released from its membrane bound form to act in a paracrine manner on endothelial cells. Here we show that Semaphorin 4D is a novel target for the membrane-tethered collagenase membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase. We demonstrate that this metalloproteinase, which is not expressed in normal or immortal but non-tumorigenic epithelial cell lines, was present in several head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and was required for processing and release of Semaphorin 4D into its soluble form from these cells, thereby inducing endothelial cell chemotaxis in vitro and blood vessel growth in vivo. These results suggest that the proteolytic cleavage of Semaphorin 4D may provide a novel molecular mechanism by which membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase controls tumor-induced angiogenesis.

These results suggest that the proteolytic cleavage of Semaphorin 4D may provide a novel molecular mechanism by which membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase controls tumor-induced angiogenesis. The semaphorins represent a large family of phylogenetically conserved molecules, both membrane-bound and secreted, originally identified by their ability to provide attractive and repulsive axon guidance cues during axon growth (1Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Semaphorins have been grouped into eight classes based upon their species of origin and sequence similarity: Classes 1 and 2 are found in invertebrates, Classes 3-7 in vertebrates, and Class V is encoded by some non-neurotropic DNA viruses (2Semaphorin Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 551-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The plexins and the neuropilins are the two main families of receptors for the semaphorins, and they can homodimerize or heterodimerize upon ligand binding depending on whether the semaphorin is soluble or membrane bound (3Kolodkin A.L.

Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). It is the plexins, however, that initiate the signaling cascades upon binding of a semaphorin ligand. There have been nine plexins identified in humans so far, most of which have been shown to regulate neuronal cell growth and contact and nerve fasciculation (8Ohta K. Mizutani A. Kawakami A. Murakami Y. Kasuya Y. Takagi S. Tanaka H. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1189-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Satoda M. Takagi S. Ohta K. Hirata T. Fujisawa H. J.

They are grouped into four families, A through D, based upon sequence homology. While sharing homology in their extracellular region with the scatter factor receptors such as RON and c-Met, the intracellular region of the plexins contain a unique domain called the Sex-Plex domain that is highly conserved within and across species. The semaphorins and plexins recently have been implicated in a host of responses including regulation of cell migration (11Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), immune responses (12Kumanogoh A. Kikutani H. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 670-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), tumor progression (13Neufeld G. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Guttmann-Raviv N. Herzog Y. Kessler O. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and tissue organization during development (14Dalpe G. Zhang L.W. Zheng H. Culotti J.G. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2073-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Brown C.B. Feiner L. Lu M.M. Li J. Ma X. Webber A.L. Jia L. Raper J.A. Epstein J.A.

Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3061-3070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the functions of proteins involved in the transmission of axonal guidance cues have been expanded to include regulation of blood vessel growth and endothelial precursor cell homing during vessel development (17Autiero M. De Smet F. Claes F. Carmeliet P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Carmeliet P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 2005; 436: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). We and others (19Basile J.R. Barac A. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5212-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Conrotto P. Valdembri D. Corso S. Serini G. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Bussolino F. Giordano S. Blood. 2005; 105: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) have observed that Plexin-B1 is highly expressed in endothelial cells and promotes migration and tubulogenesis when bound by its ligand, Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D). 2The abbreviations used are: Sema4D, semaphorin 4D; HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(s); MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane type 1-MMP; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA.2The abbreviations used are: Sema4D, semaphorin 4D; HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(s); MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane type 1-MMP; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. Surprisingly, while exploring the nature of the molecules expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), we have recently observed that Sema4D is highly expressed in HNSCC as well as in some of the most prevalent solid tumors, including breast, prostate, and colon carcinomas (21Basile J.R. Castilho R.M. Williams V.P. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9017-9022Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the class IV semaphorins may regulate angiogenesis in vivo and raise the possibility that Sema4D could play a role in tumor-induced angiogenesis. However, to exert its pro-angiogenic functions, Sema4D, a membrane bound protein, must be processed and released into a soluble form to act in a paracrine manner on endothelial cells. Semaphorin 4D is known to be expressed on the surface of cells as a homodimer, but it has also been shown to be shed into the surrounding environment through proteolytic cleavage, the mechanism for which has only recently been investigated (22Elhabazi A. Delaire S. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4341-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The protease responsible for Semaphorin 4D cleavage is likely a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), a group of zinc-dependent enzymes that hydrolyze numerous components of the extracellular matrix, because shedding could be partly inhibited by the MMP inhibitors EDTA and EGTA (22Elhabazi A. Delaire S. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4341-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of MMPs in cancer cells has been linked to acquisition of an invasive phenotype, with cells acquiring the ability to digest extracellular matrix substrates and invade underlying tissue and metastasize (23Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have found HNSCC secrete a soluble form of Sema4D that acts through Plexin-B1 on the surface of endothelial cells to enhance tumor growth and survival by promoting angiogenesis (21Basile J.R. Castilho R.M. Williams V.P. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9017-9022Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this study, we use general and specific inhibitors of MMPs and knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to demonstrate that Sema4D is a novel target for membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP, also called MMP14), a member of a family of metalloproteinases that are tethered to the cell membrane and confer peri-cellular proteolytic activity but also participate in the processing of membrane bound receptors and proteins (24Sato H. Takino T. Kinoshita T. Imai K. Okada Y. Stetler Stevenson W.G. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We found that MT1-MMP, while not expressed in non-tumorigenic epithelial cell lines, was present in several head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. MT1-MMP was required for processing and release of Sema4D into its soluble form from these cells, thereby inducing endothelial cell chemotaxis in vitro and tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo. These results suggest that the proteolytic cleavage of Sema4D may provide a novel molecular mechanism by which MT1-MMP controls tumor-induced angiogenesis. Cell Culture—HNSCC cell lines and MT1-MMP and MMP-2 wild-type and knock-out MEFs were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma). The human T cell line, Jurkat, was grown in RPMI (Sigma). Porcine aorta endothelial cells were cultured in HAM F-12 media (Sigma). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Sigma). Cells were treated with GM6001 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), TIMP-1 (Sigma), or TIMP-2 (Sigma) where indicated. Immunoblot Analysis—Analysis of whole cell extracts was performed as described previously (25Basile J.R. Afkhami T. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6889-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For transmembrane proteins, cells were processed as previously described (26Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5% precondensed Triton X-114) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min, after which it separated into an upper (aqueous) layer, which was discarded, and a lower (detergent) phase that was quantified and loaded onto the gel. For analysis of conditioned media, 4.5 ml of serum free media was placed on cells growing in 10 cm dishes and left overnight to concentrate molecules released to the media. Sample buffer was added directly to the media after collection and 50 μl loaded for immunoblotting. Following gel electrophoresis, a transfer was done onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), which was incubated with the appropriate antibodies: Semaphorin 4D (BD Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences), Tubulin (Pharmingen), EGFR (SC03, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and MT1-MMP (Chemicon). Proteins were detected using the Super-Signal chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Gelatin Zymography—Gelatin zymography was performed as described previously (27Liotta L. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 285-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-PAGE gelatin gels (Invitrogen) were loaded with 25 μg of protein and run as a standard immunoblot (see above). The gels were soaked in renaturing buffer for 30 min, incubated overnight in developing buffer, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Migration Assays—Serum free medium containing the indicated cell type or chemoattractant was placed in the bottom well of a Boyden chamber, while serum-free medium containing endothelial cells was added to the top. The two chambers were separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone filter membrane (Osmonics, GE Water Technologies, Trevose, PA, 8 μm pore size) coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Invitrogen). After 7 h, the chamber was disassembled and the membrane stained with Diff-Quick Stain (Diff-Quick, Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL), placed on a glass slide, and scanned. Densitometric quantitation was performed with NIH image software. Lentivirus Infections—The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences for human MT1-MMP were obtained from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s RNAi library (RNAi Codex) (28Siolas D. Lerner C. Burchard J. Ge W.

Biol. 2004; 265: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides based upon the following sequence, identified as shRNA2, worked best to knock down MT1-MMP: 5′-TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGCAGCCTTCCAACTCTGGAGTAATAGT GAAGCCACAGATGTATTACTCCAGAGTTGGAAGGCTTTGCCTACTGCCTCGGA-3′. shRNA1, used as a control, was generated by the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGCTGGGCTGAAAGTGACTGGGAATAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTATTCCCAGTCACTTTCAGCCCAATGCCTACTGCCTCGGA-3′. Oligonucleotides were digested with XhoI/EcoRI, and cloned into pSHAG MAGIC2 (29Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 265: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar), an entry vector for the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). In the case of wild-type MT1-MMP, the sequence was cloned into pSHAG MAGIC2 at SalI/XhoI. For catalytically inactive MT1-MMP, the E240A mutation was generated using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) prior to cloning into pSHAG MAGIC2. An LR reaction was performed to transfer the inserts into pWPI GW, a Gateway-compatible CSCG-based retroviral destination vector. Virus was prepared as reported previously (30Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) using 293T cells as the packaging cells. Target cells were infected with viral supernatants for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 8 μg/ml of polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide, Sigma). Transfection—Where indicated, cells were transfected prior to immunoblotting, migration assays, or angiogenesis assays with pcDNA 3.1/GS/Sema4D or pSecTag2B Sema4D, or the appropriate control vectors, using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), supplemented with CombiMag transfection agent (Oz Biosciences, Marseille, France), to increase transfection efficiency. In Vivo Cultrex Assay—A DIVAA assay (Trevigen, Gaithers-burg, MD) was performed as described previously (31Guedez L. Rivera A.M. Salloum R. Miller M.L. Diegmueller J.J. Bungay P.M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1431-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, angioreactors were filled with 18 μl of Cultrex-reconstituted basement membrane substrate (Trevigen) containing 37.5 ng of vascular endothelial growth factor and 12.5 ng of basic fibroblast growth factor (positive control), phosphate-buffered saline (negative control), or 1 × 106 HN12 cells in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, treated as indicated prior to the assay. These were implanted subcutaneously into 6-week-old nude mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Nine days after implantation, the mice were sacrificed and the angioreactors removed, photographed, and processed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Griffonia lectin, an endothelial cell-selective reagent (32Sahagun G. Moore S.A. Fabry Z. Schelper R.L. Hart M.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 1227-1232PubMed Google Scholar, 33Laitinen L. Histochem. J. 1987; 19: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), to quantify invasion of endothelial cells into the angioreactors. Fluorescence was determined in a plate reader as mean relative fluorescence units for triplicate assays. We previously have shown that HNSCC cells secrete a soluble form of Sema4D that acts through Plexin-B1 on the surface of endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis in mouse tumor xenografts (21Basile J.R. Castilho R.M. Williams V.P. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9017-9022Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, in search of the proteolytic activity responsible for Sema4D release, we used a representative HNSCC cell line, HN12, which exhibits Sema4D-mediated angiogenesis and focused our attention on metalloproteinases based upon their potential role in Sema4D proteolysis in T-lymphocytes (22Elhabazi A. Delaire S. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4341-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HN12 cells failed to release soluble Sema4D into the conditioned medium when treated with GM6001, a general metalloproteinase inhibitor (34Galardy R.E. Grobelny D. Foellmer H.G. Fernandez L.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4715-4718PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), showing that a metalloproteinase activity was required for Sema4D release. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, which inhibits soluble matrix metalloproteinases was unable to block Sema4D release (Fig. 1B). In contrast, TIMP-2, which inhibits both soluble and membrane-type MMPs, completely inhibited Sema4D release (Fig. 1C). This pattern of proteinase inhibitor sensitivity, where Sema4D release is inhibited by TIMP-2 but not TIMP-1, suggested that Sema4D release could be mediated by the MT-MMPs. Of the six human MT-MMPs, MT1-MMP is most frequently overexpressed in tumors and associated with tumor progression and angiogenesis (35Sounni N.E. Devy L. Hajitou A. Frankenne F. Munaut C. Gilles C. Deroanne C. Thompson E.W. Foidart J.M. Noel A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 36Deryugina E.I. Soroceanu L. Strongin A.Y.

To address the possible role of MT1-MMP in Sema4D release, MEFs from MT1-MMP knock-out mice (38Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) and wild-type littermates were transfected with a full-length, membrane-bound form of Sema4D. Equal levels of Sema4D were seen in total cell lysates from wild-type and knock-out MEFs transfected with the Sema4D construct (Fig. 2A). However, MT1-MMP knock-out cells failed to release Sema4D into conditioned medium (Fig. 2A). MT1-MMP knock-out MEFs transfected with a Sema4D plasmid engineered to produce a secreted form of Sema4D (39Coloma M.J. Hastings A. Wims L.A. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 152: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) released Sema4D into conditioned medium (Fig. 2B), indicating that the cellular machinery involved in the processing and secretion of soluble proteins remained intact. Although zymograms still showed significant secretion of pro-MMP-2 (gelatinase A) in MT1-MMP knock-out MEFs as well as the wild-type cells (Fig. 2A, lower right, lower band), MT1-MMP is known to play an important role in MMP-2 activation (40Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Thus, we challenged whether our results were due to a decrease of pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP by transfecting Sema4D into MMP-2 knock-out MEFs. Both wild-type and MMP-2 knock-out MEFs exhibited equal levels of Sema4D in cell lysates and released equal levels of Sema4D in the conditioned media, establishing that MMP-2 activity is not necessary for Sema4D release (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the catalytic activity of MT1-MMP was required for Sema4D release, we generated lentiviruses expressing either wild-type MT1-MMP or a catalytically inactive MT1-MMP containing an active site point mutation (E240A) (41Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and infected wild-type and MT1-MMP knock-out MEFs transfected with full-length Sema4D. Re-expression of MT1-MMP in knock-out MEFs by infection with lentiviruses coding for wild-type MT1-MMP and its E240A mutant was confirmed by Western blot analysis of membrane extracts (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Immunoblots for Sema4D demonstrated its expression in cells transfected with the full-length Sema4D (Fig. 3B, lysate, upper panel, lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9) and in media conditioned by control infected wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3B, lane 4, CM, upper panel) but in MT1-MMP knock-out MEFs only when infected with lentivirus coding for wild-type MT1-MMP (Fig. 3B, lane 8, CM, upper panel) or when transfected with pSecTag2B Sema4D, which codes for a secretory form of Sema4D (Fig. 3B, lane 11, CM, upper panel). Secretion of soluble Sema4D into the conditioned media could not be rescued in MT1-MMP knock-out MEFs infected with the catalytically inactive MT1-MMP E240A mutant (lane 9, CM, upper panel). In addition, wild-type MEFs infected with the E240A mutant secreted much lower levels of Sema4D (Fig. 3B, lane 5, CM, upper panel), suggesting that the inactive mutant may compete with the endogenous enzyme. Zymograms (Fig. 3B, CM, lower panel) supported these observations, as MMP-2 activity was decreased in all cells that lack functional MT1-MMP (lanes 3, 7, 9, 10, and 11) or where the MT1-MMP E240A mutant is exerting a potential dominant negative effect over the endogenous enzyme (lanes 3 and 5). To determine the biological significance of MT1-MMP-induced Sema4D release, we used full-length Sema4D-transfected wild-type and MT1-MMP knock-out MEFs as the chemoattractants for endothelial cells in in vitro migration assays. While both wild-type and knock-out MEF controls exhibited some chemotactic effects upon endothelial cells (Fig. 3C, MT1-MMP: wt and KO, respectively), wells containing wild-type MEFs transfected with Sema4D (Fig. 3C, wt and S4D) induced a robust endothelial cell migration, while the MT1-MMP knock-out cells transfected with Sema4D failed to do so (Fig. 3C, KO and S4D). We next performed an in vivo angiogenesis assays in nude mice. Sema4D-transfected wild-type and MT1-MMP knock-out MEFs infected with lentiviruses transducing either the wild-type MT1-MMP or the E240A mutant were mixed with reconstituted basement membrane material and placed in an open-ended silicone tube angioreactor, which was implanted subcutaneously into nude mice (31Guedez L. Rivera A.M. Salloum R. Miller M.L. Diegmueller J.J. Bungay P.M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1431-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After 9 days, reactors containing wild-type and knock-out MEFs infected with control lenti-virus demonstrated an angiogenic response at levels only slightly higher than that seen for negative controls (Fig. 3D, lanes 4 and 6), whereas MT1-MMP wild-type MEFs expressing wild-type Sema4D were able to induce blood vessel growth comparable with that seen in vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor filled control angioreactors (Fig. 3D, lane 7). In contrast, MT1-MMP knock-out MEFs expressing the wild-type form of Sema4D failed to do so (Fig. 3D, lane 5) but reacquired the ability to induce blood vessel in growth when infected with lentivirus transducing wild-type MT1-MMP (Fig. 3D, lane 10) but not the E240A catalytic site mutant (Fig. 3D, lane 9). The pro-angiogenic phenotype could also be rescued in knock-out MEFs by transfecting the secreted form of Sema4D, indicating that loss of Sema4D release is sufficient to abrogate the pro-angiogenic response in these cells (Fig. 3D, Sec S4D, lane 8) and that a catalytically active form of MT1-MMP is necessary for cells to release Sema4D and to promote angiogenesis in vivo. We next determined whether tumor cells employ this paracrine MT1-MMP/Sema4D pathway to promote angiogenesis, as Sema4D is highly expressed in HNSCC cell lines compared with normal or immortalized human oral keratinocytes (21Basile J.R. Castilho R.M. Williams V.P. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9017-9022Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HNSCC cells also overexpress MT1-MMP, whereas the immortal but non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell lines HaCaT and HeLa do not (Fig. 4A). To examine the role of MT1-MMP in Sema4D release from HNSCC cells, we reduced the expression of endogenous MT1-MMP by generating lentiviruses expressing shRNAs for MT1-MMP (28Siolas D. Lerner C. Burchard J. Ge W. Linsley P.S. Paddison P.J. Hannon G.J. Cleary M.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, we identified an shRNA construct that caused a marked reduction in MT1-MMP protein levels (shRNA2, lane 5) and MMP-2 activation (Fig. 4C, lower panel, lane 4), which, when expressed in HN12 cells, markedly reduced Sema4D release into the conditioned medium (Fig. 4C, upper panel, lane 4). To determine the significance of MT1-MMP-mediated Sema4D release for tumor-induced angiogenesis, we used HN12 cells infected with lentiviruses expressing the functional MT1-MMP shRNA (Fig. 4A, shRNA2, lane 5) or a control shRNA (Fig. 4A, shRNA1, lane 4) in in vivo angiogenesis assays in nude mice (31Guedez L. Rivera A.M. Salloum R. Miller M.L. Diegmueller J.J. Bungay P.M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1431-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The results showed significant blood vessel growth into angioreactors containing HN12 cells infected with control virus (Fig. 4D, upper panel, HN12, reactor 3), similar to that seen for positive controls (Fig. 4D, upper panel, VEGF/FGF (vascular endothelial growth factor/fibroblast growth factor), reactor 2) but only slight growth into reactors containing HN12 cells infected with MT1-MMP shRNA (Fig. 4D, upper panel, HN12, MT1-MMP shRNA, reactor 4), thus supporting a critical role for MT1-MMP in tumor induced angiogenesis. Importantly, blood vessel growth could be fully restored in reactors containing HN12 cells infected with MT1-MMP shRNA expressing virus when these cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the soluble form of Sema4D (Fig. 4D, upper panel, Sec S4D, reactor 5). Measurement of fluorescein isothiocyanate-lectin binding to the endothelial contents of reactors supported these findings and demonstrated reduced fluorescence in reactors that contained HN12 cells transduced with MT1-MMP shRNA (Fig. 4D, bottom panel, HN12, MT1-MMP shRNA, reactor 4) compared with the robust fluorescence seen in reactors containing control-infected HN12 cells (Fig. 4D, right panel, HN12, reactor 3). These results support the notion that MT1-MMP may contribute to the ability of carcinoma cells to induce angiogenesis by promoting the release of Sema4D. While genetic and biochemical studies have implicated semaphorins and their receptors, the plexins, in numerous aspects of neural development, evidence now suggests that the plexin-semaphorin signaling system can control blood vessel growth and development as well (18Carmeliet P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 2005; 436: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). We have recently observed that Plexin-B1 is highly expressed in endothelial cells and is able to promote endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis in response to Sema4D (19Basile J.R. Barac A. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5212-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although Sema4D is a membrane-bound protein, some semaphorins are known to exist in both membrane-bound and secreted forms (42Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar). We have observed spontaneous processing of membrane bound Sema4D into a smaller form that is released by HNSCC into to the surrounding tissue culture media, findings aligned with recent observations of the presence of Sema4D as a soluble protein produced by T lymphocytes through cleavage of the membrane form at a cysteine residue located immediately after the transmembrane domain (22Elhabazi A. Delaire S. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4341-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that Sema4D may act at a distance similar to other pro-angiogenic molecules that promote endothelial cell chemotaxis, although the mechanism of shedding from the cell surface has remained elusive. Here we show that MT1-MMP is required for this process. MT1-MMP is a member of a MMP subfamily that consists of six enzymes, MT (1-6)-MMP, all of which share peptide sequence homology (43Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5093) Google Scholar). Like other MMPs, MT1-MMP is synthesized as a zymogen that requires proteolytic processing to generate its active, membrane-tethered form. Once activated, MT1-MMP has been shown to be crucial for pericellular collagenolysis and subsequently is considered a key enzyme that contributes to tumor cell invasion and metastasis through direct extracellular matrix degradation (43Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5093) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is also known to act on other proteinases and MMPs, proteinase inhibitors, growth factors and their receptors, chemokines and cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules, thereby influencing cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis by shedding cell surface molecules or by producing biologically functional fragments from extracellular matrix components (37Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 44Bauvois B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in the migration and invasion of malignant cells, MT1-MMP is frequently overexpressed in aggressive, metastatic neoplasms, such as observed in cancers of the lung, colon, liver, breast, brain, head and neck, ovary, and uterine cervix (45Seiki M. Koshikawa N. Yana I. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 46Katayama A. Bandoh N. Kishibe K. Takahara M. Ogino T. Nonaka S. Harabuchi Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition to its other numerous protumorigenic effects, we demonstrate that MT1-MMP is necessary to generate soluble Sema4D. We focused on this MMP based upon the loss of Sema4D shedding following the administration of various MMP inhibitors. We show that MT1-MMP-mediated Sema4D shedding can induce endothelial cell chemotaxis in vitro and that HNSCC cell lines express this enzyme while non-invasive epithelial cell lines do not. Expression of MT1-MMP in HNSCC cells appears to be important for tumor-induced angiogenesis, as knocking down MT1-MMP expression with lentiviruses expressing MT1-MMP shRNAs greatly reduced the response in an in vivo angiogenesis assay, while re-introduction of MT1-MMP into knock-out MEFs restored the angiogenic phenotype. MT1-MMP expression in some cells is able to induce activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) cascade and gene transcription under the control of the serum response element (47Gingras D. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Langlois S. Lachambre M.P. Annabi B. Beliveau R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated a catalytically dead form of MT1-MMP and demonstrated that it is the catalytic activity of the enzyme that is, in fact, necessary for processing and shedding of Sema4D. Our catalytically inactive mutant was also able to compete with endogenous protein to reduce, although not completely block, Sema4D cleavage when introduced into wild-type MEFs through lentiviral gene transfer. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that MT1-MMP acts upon Sema4D on the cell surface to cleave and release this protein, which then diffuses out and is able to exert its pro-angiogenic effects at a distance. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that an intermediate protein or proteins exist in this pathway, and it is the activation of the intermediates that then go on to process Sema4D from the cell surface. Tumor progression and metastasis in large part depend upon the acquisition of an angiogenic capacity. Fast growing tumors become hypoxic because the tumor cells overwhelm the ability of the vasculature to meet their high metabolic demands. Paradoxically, it is the hypoxic environment generated in a tumor as it rapidly outgrows its blood supply that eventually leads to the switch from an avascular to a neovascular phenotype (48Fang J. Yan L. Shing Y. Moses M.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5731-5735PubMed Google Scholar), a process that turns on the production of membrane bound pro-angiogenic proteins and soluble survival factors that induce proliferation and migration in surrounding endothelial cells (49Vajkoczy P. Farhadi M. Gaumann A. Heidenreich R. Erber R. Wunder A. Tonn J.C. Menger M.D. Breier G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recent reports have identified MT1-MMP as a hypoxia-induced gene product (50Petrella B.L. Lohi J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 51Noda K.

Ottlecz A. Lambrou G.N. Bazan H.E. Bazan N.G. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 341-350PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found evidence that Sema4D might be up-regulated in some HNSCC cell lines upon exposure to hypoxic conditions as well. 3J. R. Basile, K. Holmbeck, T. H. Bugge, and J. Silvio Gutkind, unpublished observations. These observations raise the possibility of the existence of a pro-angiogenic mechanism whereby tumor cells concomitantly increase expression of MT1-MMP and Sema4D as the neoplasms acquires a neovascular phenotype. Sema4D is cleaved from the surface of the tumor cells in a MT1-MMMP-dependent manner, thereby facilitating angiogenesis by acting as a chemotactic agent for Plexin-B1 expressing endothelial cells (Fig. 5). These possibilities are under current investigation. Our present findings indicate that the MT1-MMP-dependent proteolytic cleavage of Sema4D may play a critical role in tumor-induced angiogenesis and therefore may represent new fronts of attack in the anti-angiogenic therapy of cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2069063970,"Zinc is an essential nutrient. Genetic evidence for this nutritional requirement in humans is the zinc deficiency disease, acrodermatitis enteropathica. This disorder is caused by mutations in hZIP4 (SLC39A4), a zinc importer required for zinc uptake in enterocytes and other cell types. Studies in mice have demonstrated that levels of the mZIP4 mRNA are reduced by elevated dietary zinc, resulting in a decreased abundance of the ZIP4 protein at the plasma membrane. Moreover, studies in cultured cells have demonstrated that low micromolar concentrations of zinc stimulate the endocytosis of the mZIP4 protein resulting in a reduction in cellular zinc uptake. In this study, we demonstrate an additional level of hZIP4 regulation involving ubiquitination and degradation of this transporter in elevated zinc concentrations. Mutational analysis identified a cytoplasmic histidine-rich domain that was essential for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of ZIP4 and protection against zinc toxicity. However, this motif was dispensable for zinc-induced endocytosis. These findings indicate that ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the ZIP4 protein is critical for regulating zinc homeostasis in response to the upper tier of physiological zinc concentrations, via a process that is distinct from zinc-stimulated endocytosis.

Zinc is an essential trace element required for many enzymes as a catalytic cofactor and a critical component of structural motifs such as zinc fingers. However, zinc is also potentially toxic when allowed to accumulate beyond cellular needs. Thus, homeostatic mechanisms have evolved to precisely regulate intracellular levels of this nutrient. The importance of zinc in humans is illustrated by the genetic disorder of zinc deficiency acrodermatitis enteropathica (1Kury S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Taieb A. Mallet E. Baudon J.J. Glastre C.

This disease is caused by mutations in ZIP4, a zinc importer required for the absorption of dietary zinc by enterocytes and in other cell types (2Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am.

For example, in mice the levels of mZIP4 mRNA are increased in response to zinc limitation in enterocytes and yolk sac and suppressed upon zinc repletion (5Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M.

Moreover, the abundance of mZIP4 protein at the plasma membrane of enterocytes is rapidly diminished when zinc-deficient mice are fed a zinc-replete diet (5Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mZIP4 protein may be removed from the plasma membrane by zinc-stimulated endocytosis. Subsequent in vitro studies confirmed this in HEK293 cells transfected with recombinant mZIP4 protein (8Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In these studies, human and murine ZIP4 was shown to accumulate at the plasma membrane during zinc deficiency and undergo endocytosis when cells were exposed to low zinc concentrations (∼1 μm Zn). This Zn2+-stimulated endocytosis of ZIP4 resulted in a reduction in ZIP4-dependent zinc uptake suggesting that this process controls the entry of zinc into cells (8Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).In the current study, we demonstrate an additional level of regulation of ZIP4 involving ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein. ZIP4 protein was found to degrade at higher levels of zinc concentrations (10–20 μm) than those required to promote its endocytosis (∼1 μm). Further analysis demonstrated that ZIP4 endocytosis was a prerequisite for ZIP4 degradation via a process that required both the proteasomal and lysosomal compartments. Overexpression of a dominant-negative ubiquitin mutant resulted in the suppression of Zn2+-responsive ZIP4 degradation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed zinc-dependent ubiquitination of ZIP4. A histidinerich putative zinc binding domain was required for zinc-induced degradation and ubiquitination. These findings identify Zn2+-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of ZIP4 as an additional regulatory mechanism controlling zinc homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The hZIP4 cDNA was cloned into the expression vector, pcDNA3.1, and the hemagglutinin (HA) 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine; GFP, green fluorescent protein. antigen epitope was added at the C terminus, as described previously (8Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The hZIP4 mutations in this study were generated by PCR mutagenesis and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. N-terminal 3×FLAG-tagged human ubiquitin was kindly provided by Kazuo Sugamura and Nobuyuki Tanaka (Tohoku University, Japan). N-terminal 3×FLAG-tagged human ubiquitin K48R was generated using a QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The GFP-tagged dynamin I-K44A mutant construct was kindly provided by Dr. Pietro DeCamilli (Yale University). The cytoplasmic loop (Leu424 to Met499) containing the histidine-rich motif of wild-type hZIP4 or the 5H-5A mutant was subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid to assess sufficiency of this region for zinc-induced degradation.Reagents, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—All chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma. The human embryonic kidney HEK293 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. HEK293 cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector or the same vector harboring the wild-type or mutant alleles of hZIP4 using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were established by the selection with 500 μg/ml G418 in the growth medium (Amersham Biosciences). Transient transfections of plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type ubiquitin or ubiquitin-K48R, or GFP-tagged wild-type dynamin I or dynamin I-K44A were performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cell viability assays were carried out using the Cell Proliferation Kit I (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Roche Applied Science). All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Roche Applied Science, and Alexa-488 and -588 conjugated antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. All other antibodies were from Sigma. Zinc depletion of 10% fetal bovine serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was performed using Chelex 100 as described previously (8Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis—Cells cultured in 6-well trays were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted by centrifugation. After several washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer containing 62 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and the protein concentration of the lysates was determined using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of protein lysates was separated using SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). As a loading control, the same membranes were stripped and re-probed with anti-tubulin antibody. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide added to the medium to inhibit protein synthesis prior to treatment with zinc or other metals. In other experiments, endocytosis inhibitors (sucrose or methyl-β-cyclodextrin) or proteasome inhibitors (MG132 or lactacystin) were added to culture medium as described in the text. Inhibition of glycosylation was performed using 1 μg/ml tunicamycin added to the medium for 24 h. Enzymatic removal of glycosyl groups was performed by addition of 2500 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) to cell lysates at 37 °C for 1 h.Plasma Membrane Localization and Endocytosis Assays of hZIP4 Protein—The pool of hZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane was assessed by measuring the levels of anti-HA antibodies bound to the surface of HEK/hZIP4-HA cells as we have previously described for the murine ZIP4 protein (8Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK/hZIP4-HA cells in 6-well trays were washed twice with PBS on ice, blocked with ice cold 3% skim milk in PBS for 20 min, then incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-HA antibody for 1 h on ice. After extensive washing to remove unbound antibodies, cells were sonicated in SDS lysis buffer and lysates containing solubilized anti-HA antibodies were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Anti-HA antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:500) by chemiluminescence. The protein detected in the hZIP4-HA lane co-migrated with purified anti-HA antibody (data not shown).Endocytosis of hZIP4-HA protein was indirectly determined by assaying the uptake of anti-HA antibodies added to the culture media of living cells as described previously (8Kim B.E.

Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the indicated medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml anti-HA antibodies for 5 min to allow internalization of antibody/hZIP4-HA complexes by endocytosis. Cells were then transferred to ice to prevent further endocytosis then washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and surface-bound antibodies were removed by five washes with ice-cold acidic buffer (100 mm glycine, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium chloride, pH 2.2). After two additional washes with ice-cold PBS, the cells were collected, lysed, and analyzed for anti-HA antibodies by immunoblotting as described above.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown in 24-well trays for 24 h on sterile glass coverslips, washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and then fixed for 10 min at 25 °C using 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% skim milk in PBS, and then probed with the anti-HA antibodies (1:1000) followed by Alexa-488 anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1000).65Zn Uptake Assays—HEK293 cells transiently transfected with wild-type hZIP4-HA or the 5H-5A mutant were used for 65Zn uptake assays as described previously (9Wang F. Kim B.E. Petris M.J. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51433-51441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In brief, 48 h after transfection the cells were washed once in uptake buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0) and then incubated with uptake buffer containing the indicated concentrations of 65ZnCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 10 min. Assays were stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold uptake buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (stop buffer). Cells were then collected on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, 0.45-μm pore size) and washed three times in stop buffer. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 gamma counter. Duplicate samples were assayed for protein determination using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay and used to calculate zinc uptake rate.Immunoprecipitation Experiments—hZIP4-HA-expressing HEK293 cells or vector controls were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the 3×FLAG-Ubiquitin construct and then incubated for the indicated times in zinc-depleted or zinc-supplemented medium. Cells were scraped into ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and the protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The cell lysates were pre-cleared with Protein-G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C with rotation, followed by incubation with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The anti-HA affinity matrix was washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer before the proteins were eluted by boiling at 95 °C for 5 min in elution buffer. The eluates were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gradient gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the extent of hZIP4-HA ubiquitination was assessed by probing with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1,000) by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Duplicate samples were probed by anti-HA antibody (1:2,000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000). Meanwhile, total cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE gel and probed by either anti-HA antibody (1:2,000) or by anti-tubulin antibody (1:10,000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.RESULTShZIP4-HA Is a Glycosylated Protein and Functional Zinc Transporter That Undergoes Zinc-responsive Endocytosis—Recent studies have demonstrated that the murine ZIP4 protein is a high affinity zinc importer and undergoes zinc-stimulated endocytosis in response to low micromolar zinc concentrations (5Dufner-Beattie J.

We began this study by determining if the human ZIP4 protein also exhibits these properties in transfected HEK293 cells. An HA antigen tag was fused to the extracellular C terminus of hZIP4, and stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing the hZIP4-HA protein were isolated (HEK/hZIP4-HA cells). Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies indicated that the hZIP4-HA protein was resolved at an apparent molecular mass of ∼85 kDa, as well as a faster migrating protein of 80 kDa (Fig. 1A). Both bands were absent in HEK293 cells transfected with vector alone indicating they were specific for the hZIP4-HA protein. The presence of two hZIP4-HA bands was likely due to variation in glycosylation, because removal of carbohydrate moieties using peptide N-glycosidase F, or prevention of glycosylation in vivo using tunicamycin, resulted in a predominant band of 70 kDa, which is the expected molecular mass of hZIP4-HA (Fig. 1A). Kinetic studies using 65Zn demonstrated that the hZIP4-HA protein was a functional zinc transporter, as evident from the 2-fold increase in total zinc accumulation in HEK/hZIP4-HA cells compared with HEK/vector cells over a range of zinc concentrations (Fig. 1B). The apparent Km for hZIP4-HA-dependent zinc uptake was 2.5 μm, which was similar to the reported value for murine ZIP4 and other mammalian ZIP family members (5Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M.

However, depletion of zinc in the medium using the zinc chelator TPEN resulted in the dispersal of hZIP4-HA to the cell periphery, consistent with an increased abundance at the plasma membrane. The extracellular orientation of the HA-epitope tag fused to the C terminus of hZIP4 allowed levels of hZIP4-HA to be determined at the plasma membrane of intact cells by immunoblot analysis of anti-HA antibodies recovered from HEK/hZIP4-HA cells. Using this approach, we observed an increase in hZIP4-HA protein levels at the plasma membrane of HEK/hZIP4-HA cells under zinc limiting conditions relative to basal medium (Fig. 2B). This increase in hZIP4-HA protein at the plasma membrane during zinc limitation was likely due to a decrease in its endocytosis, as we have found previously for the mZIP4-HA protein (8Kim B.E. Wang F. Dufner-Beattie J. Andrews G.K. Eide D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4523-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Once again the extracellular orientation of the HA-tag on the C terminus of hZIP4-HA enabled hZIP4-HA endocytosis to be indirectly measured by the internalization of anti-HA antibody added to the culture media of living cells, as we have done previously for mZIP4-HA (8Kim B.E.

A low level of anti-HA antibody uptake was observed for HEK/hZIP4-HA cells in media made zinc-deficient using Chelex 100 (Fig. 2C). However, when zinc was added to Chelex-treated media there was a concentration-dependent increase in hZIP4-HA endocytosis, as determined by the marked increase in anti-HA antibody uptake during a 5-min incubation. As expected the HEK/vector cells, which lack hZIP4-HA, failed to internalize anti-HA antibodies. Taken together, these data suggest that plasma membrane abundance of hZIP4-HA is dependent on zinc status and that hZIP4-HA undergoes zinc-induced endocytosis.FIGURE 2The plasma membrane abundance and endocytosis of the hZIP4-HA protein is regulated by zinc availability. A, immunofluorescence microscopy detection of hZIP4-HA in HEK/hZIP4-HA cells exposed for 1 h to basal medium, basal medium plus 10 μm TPEN, or basal medium plus 10 μm TPEN and 10 μm Zn2+. B, zinc availability alters plasma membrane levels of hZIP4-HA in HEK/hZIP4-HA cells. Cells were cultured for 1 h in basal medium, Chelex-treated medium, Chelex-treated medium plus 10 μm Zn2+, basal medium plus 10 μm TPEN, or basal medium plus 10 μm TPEN and 10 μm Zn2+. Cells were then fixed, and the surface pool of hZIP4-HA protein was probed with anti-HA antibody. Antibodies retained by cells were detected by immunoblot using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. C, zinc stimulates the endocytosis of hZIP4-HA protein. HEK/hZIP4-HA cells were preincubated with Chelex-treated medium for 1 h to maximize surface levels of hZIP4-HA, before supplemented with the indicated zinc concentrations and anti-HA antibodies were added to these media before allowing endocytosis to proceed for 5 min. Surface-bound antibodies were removed from cells by acidic buffer washes and internalized anti-HA antibodies were detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)hZIP4-HA Is Degraded by Elevated Zinc—There are many examples of proteins that are degraded upon endocytosis from the plasma membrane (14Hicke L.

To explore whether such regulation occurs for hZIP4, we examined the steady-state levels of this protein in zinc-treated cells. HEK/hZIP4-HA cells were pre-treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis, and then the level of hZIP4-HA protein was determined after exposing cells to different zinc concentrations for 4 h. Significantly, this zinc treatment resulted in dose-dependent decrease in levels of hZIP4-HA protein (Fig. 3A), which was most apparent at between 150 and 200 μm zinc. This zinc treatment had no effect on the steady-state levels of another membrane transporter, Na+/K+ ATPase (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this degradation response specifically affects hZIP4-HA. Zinc-stimulated degradation of hZIP4-HA occurred as rapidly as 1 h following addition of 200 μm zinc (Fig. 3C), and as little as 10–20 μm zinc could stimulate the degradation of hZIP4-HA with longer exposures (18 h) (Fig. 3B). The metal specificity of the hZIP4-HA degradation response was examined by exposing HEK/hZIP4-HA cells to various metals at 200 μm (100 μm for cadmium) for 4 h. Besides zinc, cadmium was the only metal tested that promoted hZIP4-HA degradation (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Elevated zinc concentrations reduce levels of hZIP4-HA protein. A, immunoblot analysis of total hZIP4-HA protein in HEK/hZIP4-HA cells after exposure to elevated zinc concentrations. HEK293 cells stably expressing the pcDNA3.1 vector or hZIP4-HA were pretreated for 30 min with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) to inhibit new protein synthesis followed by a 4-h exposure to the indicated concentrations of zinc. Protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and hZIP4-HA protein was detected using anti-HA antibodies. Tubulin was detected as the loading control. B, dose-dependent degradation of hZIP4-HA by zinc. Immunoblots were used to detect the abundance of hZIP4-HA protein in HEK/hZIP4-HA cells treated with the indicated concentrations of zinc for 18 h.

HEK/hZIP4-HA cells were pretreated for 30 min with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) to inhibit new protein synthesis followed by zinc treatment for indicated times. Immunoblots were used to detect hZIP4-HA protein as described in A above. D, metal specificity of the hZIP4-HA degradation response. HEK/hZIP4-HA cells were pretreated with cycloheximide followed by exposure to either basal medium or basal media containing indicated concentrations of trace metals for 4 h. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies to detect hZIP4-HA protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the zinc-stimulated degradation of hZIP4-HA, we determined whether this process required endocytosis. Endocytosis was blocked using the dominant-negative dynamin mutant (Dyn1-K44A), which is required for the pinching of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane (17Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In HEK/hZIP4-HA cells transiently transfected with a GFP-tagged Dyn1-K44A construct, the hZIP4-HA protein accumulated at the plasma membrane, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4A) and cell surface labeling of cells with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 4B). We then examined the effect of Dyn1 K44A-mediated inhibition of endocytosis on zinc-stimulated degradation of hZIP4-HA. As shown in Fig. 4C, the Dyn1-K44A mutant suppressed the degradation of hZIP4-HA in response to elevated zinc concentrations. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis using methyl-β-cyclodextrin or sucrose also impaired the degradation of hZIP4-HA in zinc-treated HEK/hZIP4-HA cells (Fig. 4D). These findings suggested that the degradation of hZIP4-HA in response to elevated zinc concentrations requires endocytosis of the protein.FIGURE 4Endocytosis inhibitors block zinc-induced hZIP4-HA degradation. A, immunofluorescence analysis of hZIP4-HA protein in HEK/hZIP4-HA cells transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing the dynamin-K44A mutant or control vector. Cells were fixed at 16 h post-transfection and probed with rabbit anti-HA antibody, followed by Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. B, immunoblot analysis of plasma membrane levels of hZIP4-HA in HEK/vector or HEK/hZIP4-HA cells transiently transfected with the dynamin-K44A mutant or control vector.

https://openalex.org/W1974986171,"Embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency is regulated by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Previously we have demonstrated that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling is required for efficient self-renewal of murine ES cells. In the study presented here, we have investigated the downstream molecular mechanisms that contribute to the ability of PI3Ks to regulate pluripotency. We show that inhibition of PI3K activity with either pharmacological or genetic tools results in decreased expression of RNA for the homeodomain transcription factor Nanog and decreased Nanog protein levels. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) activity by PI3Ks plays a key role in regulation of Nanog expression, because blockade of GSK-3 activity effectively reversed the effects of PI3K inhibition on Nanog RNA, and protein expression and self-renewal under these circumstances were restored. Furthermore, GSK-3 mutants mimicked the effects of PI3K or GSK-3 inhibition on Nanog expression. Importantly, expression of an inducible form of Nanog prevented the loss of self-renewal observed upon inhibition of PI3Ks, supporting a functional relationship between PI3Ks and Nanog expression. In addition, expression of a number of putative Nanog target genes was sensitive to PI3K inhibition. Thus, the new evidence provided in this study shows that PI3K-dependent regulation of ES cell self-renewal is mediated, at least in part, by the ability of PI3K signaling to maintain Nanog expression. Regulation of GSK-3 activity by PI3Ks appears to play a key role in this process."

Although cDNA of the pathogenesis-related (PR) 10 family, the translation product of which catalyzes NCS reaction, has been isolated from Thalictrum flavum, its detailed enzymological properties have not yet been characterized. We report here that a distinct cDNA isolated from Coptis japonica (CjNCS1) also catalyzed NCS reaction as well as a PR10 homologue of C. japonica (CjPR10A). Both recombinant proteins stereo-specifically produced (S)-norcoclaurine by the condensation of dopamine and 4-HPAA. Because a CjNCS1 cDNA that encoded 352 amino acids showed sequence similarity to 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases of plant origin, we characterized the properties of the native enzyme. Sequence analysis indicated that CjNCS1 only contained a Fe2+-binding site and lacked the 2-oxoglutarate-binding domain. In fact, NCS reaction of native NCS isolated from cultured C. japonica cells did not depend on 2-oxoglutarate or oxygen, but did require ferrous ion. On the other hand, CjPR10A showed no specific motif. The addition of o-phenanthroline inhibited NCS reaction of both native NCS and recombinant CjNCS1, but not that of CjPR10A. In addition, native NCS and recombinant CjNCS1 accepted phenylacetaldehyde and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, as well as 4-HPAA, for condensation with dopamine, whereas recombinant CjPR10A could use 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and pyruvate in addition to the above aldehydes.

Higher plants produce divergent chemicals such as alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenolic compounds in secondary metabolism. Among these chemicals, alkaloids are very important in medicine because of their high biological activities. Alkaloids are low molecular weight, nitrogen-containing compounds that are found in ∼20% of plant species. Most alkaloids are derived from amines produced by the decarboxylation of amino acids such as histidine, lysine, ornithine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Although the coupling of amines to other products is the first important step in producing diverse alkaloids, this entry reaction has been poorly characterized. (S)-Strictosidine is a central intermediate for indole alkaloids. Strictosidine synthase, which catalyzes the formation of (S)-strictosidine from tryptamine and secologanin, is a rare exception in that its cDNA has been cloned from Catharanthus roseus and Rauvolfia serpentine (1McKnight T.D.

Total RNA was extracted from 1-, 2-, and 3-week-old cells with TRIzol and used for RNA blot analysis (10Shitan N. Bazin I. Dan K. Obata K. Kigawa K. Ueda K. Sato F. Forestier C. Yazaki K. Proc. Natl.

Construction and Sequencing of a cDNA Library of C. japonica—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated and a cDNA library was constructed as described elsewhere (8Choi K.B. Morishige T. Shitan N. Yazaki K. Sato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 830-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments were ligated into pDR196 vector (15Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the cDNA library was performed using a MegaBACE 1000 DNA Sequencing System (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA Gel Blot Analysis—10 μg of total RNA isolated from each cultured cell line was electrophoresed on formaldehyde gels and then blotted onto BioDyne A™(Pall) membranes. The EST clone sequences were amplified by PCR with primers (5′-GAA AGA AAA AAA ATA TAC CCC AGC-3′ and 5′-TTT CGT AAA TTT CTG GCA AGG TAG AC-3′), separated on agarose gel, and recovered using GenElute™ (Sigma-Aldrich) to prepare probes. PCR product was labeled with 32P-radioisotope, and RNA hybridization and signal detection were carried out according to standard protocols as reported previously (16Hibi N. Higashiguchi S. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Vectors for Recombinant CjNCS1 and CjPR10A—Expression vectors were constructed for full-length CjNCS1 and CjPR10A cDNAs without the fused peptide derived from the vector sequence in pET-41a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). CjNCS1 and CjPR10A cDNAs were amplified by PCR with 5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGA GCA AGA ATC TTA CTG GTG-3′ (NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TTA TAG TTT CAT CTG ATC CAA TAA GCT CTT ACC-3′ (XhoI adaptor is underlined) primers for CjNCS1 and 5′-GGC ATA TGA GGA TGG AAG TTG TTC TAG-3′ (NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-GGC TCG AGT TAC TCT GAA CTC TTG TGT TTG-3′ (XhoI adaptor is underlined) primers for CjPR10A. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into the pET-41a vector digested with NdeI and XhoI using a DNA ligation kit (Takara Shuzo Co.). The resulting plasmid/vector was sequenced to confirm the correct construction. Isolation of Arabidopsis Homologue (AtSRG1) to CjNCS1 and Construction of Expression Vector—Total RNA was extracted from 5-week-old callus cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana maintained on Linsmaier and Skoog medium supplemented with 3% sucrose, 10 μm 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, and 1 μm benzyladenine using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Total RNA (2.5 μg) was converted to cDNA using Superscript III according to the protocol of the manufacturer, and the AtSRG1 (GenBank™ accession number S44261), which is highly homologous to CjNCS1, was amplified by PCR using 5′-GGG AAT TCC ATA TGG AAG CAA AAG GGG CAG CA-3′ (NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-CCG CTC GAG TTA GAT TCT CAA AGC ATC TAG-3′ (XhoI adaptor is underlined) as primers. PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET-41a as described above. Heterologous Expression of Recombinant CjNCS1, CjPR10A, and AtSRG1 in E. coli—The expression vectors for full-length cDNAs of CjNCS1, CjPR10A, and AtSRG1 were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3). E. coli cells containing each plasmid were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium. After induction with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside, E. coli cells containing CjNCS1 plasmid were incubated at 16 °C for 48 h and E. coli cells containing CjPR10A and AtSRG1 plasmids were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The resulting recombinant CjNCS1 protein was extracted from a 1-liter culture of E. coli grown in Luria Bertani medium with the extraction Tris buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and then purified to homogeneity. Crude extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to fractionation with (NH4)2SO4. The desired recombinant protein was precipitated between 30 and 60% (NH4)2SO4 saturation and made soluble in the extraction buffer again. The protein solution was dialyzed in the same buffer and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Biosciences) (2.5 × 16 cm) that had been equilibrated with the extraction buffer. After the column was washed with 2 volumes of the same buffer, recombinant protein was eluted with 250 ml of a linear gradient of extraction buffer with 0–0.5 m NaCl solution. The recombinant protein fractions were detected with SDS-PAGE, and these fractions were pooled and then applied to a hydroxyapatite column (Amersham Biosciences) (2.5 × 9 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 8.0). After the column was washed with 10 mm KPB, CjNCS1 was eluted with a linear gradient (0.01–0.5 m) of KPB solution (100 ml). The active fractions were pooled and then dialyzed in 50 mm KPB (pH 8.0). All operations were performed at 4 °C, and all of the buffers contained 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol unless stated otherwise. Measurement of NCS Activity—Enzyme activity was determined in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm dopamine and 1mm 4-HPAA. 4-HPAA was produced by the enzymological conversion of tyramine with monoamine oxidase. 4-HPAA was prepared from the deamination of tyramine by purified tyramine oxidase (1 unit/ml) from Arthrobacter sp. (Sigma) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm tyramine). After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged, the supernatant was used as 2 mm 4-HPAA solution, and the reaction was considered to be complete. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1/10 volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After protein precipitation, the formation of norcoclaurine was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) (LCMA-2010A; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an LC-10A system: column, Inertsil ODS-3 (4.6 × 250 mm; GL Sciences Inc.); solvent system, acetonitrile/methanol/300 mm acetic acid (2:2:5); flow rate, 0.5 ml/min at 40 °C. To distinguish (R) and (S) forms of norcoclaurine, we used a chiral column (Sumichiral-CBH; Sumika Chemical Analysis Service) with LC-MS analysis. The solvent system was acetonitrile/0.3% acetic acid (5:95), pH 5.2; flow rate, 0.4 ml/min at 25 °C. Because we did not have an (S)-norcoclaurine standard, norcoclaurine was converted to coclaurine by recombinant 6-O-methyltransferase from C. japonica (7Morishige T. Tsujita T. Yamada Y. Sato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23398-23405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and compared with an (S)-coclaurine standard. To examine the effect of ferrous ion in the NCS reaction, the enzyme solution was preincubated with 5 mm EDTA or 0.5 mm o-phenanthroline for 5 min at 4 °C. After preincubation with chelators, the substrates were added to the reaction mixture, and the NCS activity was assayed as described above. Immunoprecipitation of NCS Activity with Antiserum against CjNCS1—Mouse polyclonal antibodies for C. japonica NCS were prepared against purified recombinant CjNCS1 at Japan Clinical Laboratories, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). These antibodies were specific to CjNCS1, and no signal was detected by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting except for CjNCS1 in crude C. japonica cell extract. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the same volume of polyclonal antiserum for CjNCS1 was added to cell lysates. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, 20 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose suspension (Calbiochem) was added to an antiserum/enzyme mixture, and the suspension was then mixed gently for another 12 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered by centrifugation, and NCS activity was determined as described above. Alignment Analysis—The protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar, 18Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) and Boxshade (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX-form.html). The phylogenetic tree was calculated by the neighbor-joining method using ClustalW (19Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). LC-NMR Method—LC was performed on an Inertsil ODS-3 reversed-phase column; solvent system, 0.1 m NH4OAc (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, D2O)/CH3CN (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) (4:1); flow rate, 0.5 ml/min at 40 °C. NMR analysis was performed as described elsewhere (20Iwasa K. Cui W. Sugiura M. Takeuchi A. Moriyasu M. Takeda K. J. Nat. Prod. 2005; 68: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NCS Activity in C. japonica Cells—(S)-Norcoclaurine, the central precursor of pharmaceutically important benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, is produced by NCS, which condenses dopamine and 4-HPAA (Fig. 1). NCS activity is usually detected by the formation of total norcoclaurine (21Samanani N. Facchini P.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas racemic norcoclaurine is also formed by a chemical reaction during the enzyme reaction. Therefore, we established a system to detect the stereo-specific formation of (S)-norcoclaurine to estimate the native NCS reaction. Crude extract from cultured C. japonica cells clearly showed that the native enzymic reaction was stereo-specific, that is, it gave the (S) form, whereas the product of the chemical reaction was a mixture of (R) and (S) forms (Fig. 2). Next, we examined the substrate specificity of NCS, because (S)-norlaudanosoline, which is produced by the condensation of dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, was once thought to be a common pathway intermediate in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis (22Rueffer M. El-Shagi H. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 5-9Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Schumacher H.M. Rüffer M. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1983; 48: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas (S)-norcoclaurine is now thought to be a natural precursor in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis (4Stadler R. Kutchan T.M. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 1083-1086Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Stadler R. Zenk M.H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1990; 6: 555-562Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of NCS was examined with several amines and aldehydes. When the condensation activity of NCS from C. japonica was examined for dopamine, tyramine, tryptamine, noradrenaline, 2-phenylethylamine, and 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenethylamine with 4-HPAA as an aldehyde donor, only dopamine produced a condensation product, norcoclaurine (data not shown). On the other hand, when several aldehydes and carboxylic acids (phenylacetaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, 4-HPAA, benzaldehyde, and pyruvic acid) were reacted with dopamine as an amine substrate, phenylacetaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, and 4-HPAA produced 1-benzyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, norlaudanosoline, and norcoclaurine, respectively (data not shown). Thus, NCS from C. japonica could condense dopamine and a phenylacetaldehyde group. Molecular Cloning of a C. japonica NCS cDNA Candidate— Because it was rather difficult to assay NCS due to the background chemical reaction until the recent development of chiral column chromatographic analysis, we tried to isolate NCS cDNA using an EST library prepared from high berberine-producing cultured C. japonica cells. In fact, our EST library of C. japonica 156-1 cells has the advantage that transcripts of berberine biosynthetic enzyme have been highly enriched.4 When the sequences of our EST library were determined, we noticed that it contained many oxygenase-like proteins that might be related to berberine biosynthesis. Additional RNA gel blot analysis showed that such oxygenase-like protein cDNA could be related to berberine biosynthesis, because the expression pattern of oxygenase-like protein was highly correlated with the expression of other biosynthetic genes in several Coptis cell lines with different berberine productivities (supplemental data). Because cDNAs for early steps in norcoclaurine biosynthesis from tyrosine have not yet been characterized, we examined the enzyme activity of this oxygenase-like protein. To examine the enzyme activity of oxygenase-like protein, we produced recombinant protein in E. coli. Although no enzyme activity was detected for tyrosine, 3,4-dihydrophenylalanine (DOPA), or tyramine, this protein produced a product with dopamine and 4-HPAA. The reaction product was identified to be (S)-norcoclaurine by LC-MS, although the enzyme activity was considerably lower than that of native enzyme. The other recombinant protein (putative 2-nitropropane dioxygenase) and pET 41-a vector, as the control, did not show NCS activity or any other enzyme activity for the early reaction from tyrosine to norcoclaurine. Thus, this clone was named CjNCS1 in this report. We determined the full-length sequence of CjNCS1 and found that this EST had 1172 nucleotides with an open reading frame that encoded 352 amino acids (supplemental data). The deduced amino acid sequence of CjNCS1 was similar to 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases of plant origin (Fig. 3). CjNCS1 had no putative signal peptide and was predicted to be cytosolic protein. CjNCS1 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation with DEAE-Sepharose CL-4B and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 40 kDa by Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration (data not shown). SDS-PAGE of CjNCS1 gave a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of 40 kDa, indicating that the recombinant CjNCS1 was a monomer (data not shown). During our characterization of CjNCS1, NCS was isolated from a T. flavum cell culture and the amino acid sequences predicted from its cDNA showed 28–38% identity with the Betv1 allergen and belonged to the PR10 protein family, whereas no homology with CjNCS1 was found (6Samanani N. Liscombe D.K. Facchini P.J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, a gene homologous to T. flavum NCS (C. japonica PR10A) was isolated from a C. japonica EST library and compared with native NCS in C. japonica cells. Recombinant CjPR10A was produced in E. coli, and the protein was used as crude extract without further purification. Both CjNCS1 and CjPR10A catalyzed the condensation of dopamine and 4-HPAA and produced (S)-norcoclaurine, although the elution time of the products differed between CjNCS1 and CjPR10A in LC-MS analysis (Fig. 4). Confirmation of the structure of the product of the NCS reaction with CjNCS1 or CjPR10A by LC-NMR also showed that the products of both CjNCS1 and CjPR10A were norcoclaurine (data not shown). Characterization of C. japonica NCS Based on the Sequence Information of CjNCS1—To characterize which gene product corresponds to native NCS in C. japonica, native NCS extracted from cultured C. japonica cells was immunoprecipitated with antiserum against recombinant CjNCS1. The activity of native NCS after immunoprecipitation with anti-CjNCS1 antibodies was markedly reduced, whereas antibodies against Cj3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4′-O-methyltransferase, another biosynthetic enzyme in the berberine pathway, did not affect the NCS activity (Fig. 5A). Because a measurable amount of NCS activity remained even after immunoprecipitation with anti-CjNCS1, we examined whether CjPR10A might be involved in the NCS reaction in C. japonica cells as shown below. Because the sequence of CjNCS1 suggested that ferrous ion may be required (Fig. 3), we examined the effect of chelators on the NCS activity of native enzymes and both recombinant proteins. o-Phenanthroline, a chelator for ferrous ion, inhibited NCS activity in C. japonica cells and recombinant CjNCS1 (Fig. 5B), whereas EDTA did not (data not shown). o-Phenanthroline as well as EDTA did not inhibit the NCS activity of CjPR10A. This result again showed CjNCS1 was involved in native NCS in C. japonica. However, it was possible that CjPR10A was still involved in native NCS, because residual NCS activity was visible. When we examined the substrate specificity of the NCS reaction, we found that the substrate specificity of CjPR10A was different from that of native NCS in C. japonica and CjNCS1. CjNCS1 and the crude extract from cultured C. japonica cells only accept dopamine and a phenylacetaldehyde group (phenylacetaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, and 4-HPAA), whereas CjPR10A used pyruvic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate for the condensation with dopamine (data not shown). This result clearly indicated that the native NCS reaction in C. japonica involved CjNCS1, not CjPR10A. The activity of recombinant CjNCS1 was lower than that of the native enzyme extracted from cultured C. japonica cells on a protein basis. Therefore, the compositions of recombinant CjNCS1 and native NCS were compared. The fractions by gel filtration for purified recombinant CjNCS1 and crude extract from C. japonica cells were analyzed by Western blotting. As a result, NCS from C. japonica was a complex, whereas recombinant CjNCS1 was a monomer (data not shown). 2-Oxoglutarate was not needed in the NCS reaction, as expected from the sequence of CjNCS1. Isopenicillin N synthase has structural characteristics similar to those of CjNCS1: requirement for ferrous ion, but not 2-oxoglutarate (25Perry D. Abraham E.P. Baldwin J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar). Because isopenicillin N synthase requires oxygen for its enzyme activity, we examined the requirement for oxygen in the NCS reaction. The depletion of dissolved oxygen in the reaction mixture by the glucose oxidase-catalase system (26Bouin J.C. Atallah M.T. Hultin H.O. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 44: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) did not reduce NCS activity. Thus, we concluded that NCS of C. japonica was a novel 2-oxoglutarate-independent dioxygenase-like protein that catalyzed the cyclase reaction without oxygen and was different from isopenicillin N synthase. Sequence Comparison of CjNCS1 and Other Plant Dioxygenases—The sequence of CjNCS1 was compared with those of other representative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases in plants to estimate the molecular basis of reaction (Fig. 3). The sequence of CjNCS1 showed a typical 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase-like protein sequence as in other plant genes. CjNCS1 had two completely conserved histidine and aspartate residues (His-228 and Asp-230) that wouldactasferrousligands, as reported for other 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (27De Carolis E. De Luca V. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the motif His X Asp (53–57 amino acids) X His (28Borovok I. Landman O. Kreisberg-Zakarin R. Aharonowitz Y. Cohen G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (indicated by asterisks). However, CjNCS1 did not have the highly conserved consensus sequence for binding of the co-substrate, 2-oxoglutarate, Asn-Tyr-"

Cannabinoids are known to exert an antitumoral action on gliomas that relies on at least two mechanisms: induction of apoptosis of transformed cells and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. However, whether cannabinoids target human glioma stem cells and their potential impact in gliomagenesis are unknown. Here, we show that glioma stem-like cells derived from glioblastoma multiforme biopsies and the glioma cell lines U87MG and U373MG express cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2) receptors and other elements of the endocannabinoid system. In gene array experiments, CB receptor activation altered the expression of genes involved in the regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The cannabinoid agonists HU-210 and JWH-133 promoted glial differentiation in a CB receptor-dependent manner as shown by the increased number of S-100β- and glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing cells. In parallel, cannabinoids decreased the cell population expressing the neuroepithelial progenitor marker nestin. Moreover, cannabinoid challenge decreased the efficiency of glioma stem-like cells to initiate glioma formation in vivo, a finding that correlated with decreased neurosphere formation and cell proliferation in secondary xenografts. Gliomas derived from cannabinoid-treated cancer stem-like cells were characterized with a panel of neural markers and evidenced a more differentiated phenotype and a concomitant decrease in nestin expression. Overall, our results demonstrate that cannabinoids target glioma stem-like cells, promote their differentiation, and inhibit gliomagenesis, thus giving further support to their potential use in the management of malignant gliomas.

Malignant gliomas remain the most deadly human brain tumors, with poor prognosis despite years of research in anti-tumoral therapeutic strategies. A hallmark characteristic of gliomas is their molecular and cellular heterogeneity (1Maher E.A. Furnari F.B. Bachoo R.M. Rowitch D.H. Louis D.N. Cavenee W.K. DePinho R.A.

Moreover, even morphologically or histologically related tumors may behave very differently. Neoplastic transformation of differentiated glial cells was for many years the most accepted hypothesis to explain the origin of gliomas (1Maher E.A. Furnari F.B. Bachoo R.M. Rowitch D.H. Louis D.N.

Dai C. Schaefer L. Sawaya R.E. Fuller G.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). These findings are in line with the observation that gliomagenesis is frequently associated with adult brain germinal zones, in particular the subventricular zone (2Sanai N. Alvarez-Buylla A. Berger M.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 11-22Crossref Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 3Vescovi A.L. Galli R. Reynolds B.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). It is therefore imperative that the development of new therapeutic strategies for the management of gliomas takes into account their cellular diversity and origin. Among those strategies, cannabinoid-based drugs may represent an alternative to other established chemotherapeutics (12Guzmán M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The discovery of an endogenous cannabinoid system (13Piomelli D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), together with the great improvement in our understanding of the signaling mechanisms responsible for cannabinoid actions (12Guzmán M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 13Piomelli D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), has fostered the interest in the potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids (14Makriyannis A. Mechoulam R. Piomelli D. Neuropharmacology. 2005; 48: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated a significant antitumoral action of cannabinoid ligands in animal models (12Guzmán M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Thus, cannabinoid administration to nude mice curbs the growth of different tumors, including gliomas, lung adenocarcinomas, thyroid epitheliomas, lymphomas, and skin carcinomas (12Guzmán M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The antitumoral action on gliomas relies on at least two mechanisms: induction of apoptosis of tumor cells (15Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Cortés M.L. Gomez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzmán M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 16Sánchez C. de Ceballos M.L. Gómez del Pulgar T. Rueda D. Corbacho C. Velasco G. Galve-Roperh I. Huffman J.W. Ramón y Cajal S.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Besides their wide distribution in tumor cells, cannabinoid receptors are expressed and functionally active in neural progenitors, in which they regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (18Rueda D.

This background prompted us to investigate the actions of cannabinoids on human GSCs and their impact in gliomagenesis. Our results show that GSCs express cannabinoid receptors and that cannabinoid stimulation reduces glioma initiation in vivo, a finding that correlates with increased cell differentiation. These findings provide further support for cannabinoid-based antitumoral therapies that are able to target the brain tumor stem cell compartment. Materials—The following materials were kindly donated as indicated: SR141716 and SR144528 (Sanofi-Aventis, Montpellier, France), JWH-133 (J. Huffman), anti-mouse cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor polyclonal antibody (K. Mackie), and anti-trimethyl-histone H3 (Lys9) polyclonal antibody (Upstate; I. Flores).

Anti-cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor polyclonal antibody was from Affinity BioReagents, and anti-S-100β antibody was from Swant. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) were from R&D Systems. Mouse anti-β-tubulin III monoclonal antibody was from Covance Inc., and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), anti-MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Glioblastoma multiforme (World Health Organization grade IV astrocytoma) samples were provided by the Tissue Bank Network of the Molecular Pathology Program of the Spanish National Cancer Centre. GSC Culture and Gliomagenesis in Vivo—GSCs were obtained from human brain tumor biopsies digested with collagenase (type Ia, Sigma) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium at 37 °C for 90 min (17Blázquez C. González-Feria L. Álvarez L. Casanova L. Guzmán M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and grown under non-adherent conditions (19Aguado T. Monory K. Palazuelos J. Stella N. Cravatt B. Lutz B. Marsicano G. Kokaia Z. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1704-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) in neural stem cell culture medium composed of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s and Ham’s F-12 media supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen), 50 mm Hepes, 2 μg/ml heparin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 20 ng/ml FGF-2, and 20 ng/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. Of eight biopsies employed, five rendered cells that fulfilled stem-like cell criteria (3Vescovi A.L. Galli R. Reynolds B.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Representative results are shown for one of these GSC lines and were also extended to GSCs derived from classical human glioma U87MG and U373MG cell lines. Cell lines were grown as described (15Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Cortés M.L. Gomez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzmán M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 17Blázquez C. González-Feria L. Álvarez L. Casanova L. Guzmán M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and inoculated in vivo, and after tumor digestion, GSCs were cultured. Clonal neurospheres were grown at 1000 cells/ml and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of different stem cell markers, including CD133, the stem cell factor receptor c-Kit, and their ability to exclude Hoechst 33342 (side population analysis). Differentiation experiments were performed in polyornithine-coated plates, and adherent GSCs were grown in neural stem cell culture medium without growth factors. GSCs were cultured in the presence of the indicated stimuli after overnight growth factor deprivation. Differentiation experiments with at least three independent cultures were performed by quantification of the percentage of total cells that expressed the indicated neural antigens or that were highly positive for histone H3 trimethylated at Lys9. A minimum of 10 fields were scored in a double-blinded manner to minimize subjective interpretations. Quantified fields were selected randomly by visualizing total cells with a microscope Hoechst filter. Stock solutions of cellular effectors were prepared in Me2SO, and the concentrations employed were selected based on previous studies on cannabinoid regulation of neural progenitors (19Aguado T. Monory K. Palazuelos J. Stella N. Cravatt B. Lutz B. Marsicano G. Kokaia Z. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1704-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). No significant influence of Me2SO on any of the parameters determined was observed at the final concentration used (0.1%, v/v). Control incubations included the corresponding vehicle content. Gliomagenesis was induced by subcutaneous flank inoculation into athymic nude mice of U87MG-GSCs or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) GSCs in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% glucose (16Sánchez C. de Ceballos M.L. Gómez del Pulgar T. Rueda D. Corbacho C. Velasco G. Galve-Roperh I. Huffman J.W. Ramón y Cajal S. Guzmán M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5784-5789PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, 1.5 mg/kg JWH-133 or the corresponding vehicle was administered daily to subcutaneous gliomas. Tumor growth was measured with an external caliper, and volume was calculated as (4π/3) × (width/2)2× (length/2). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—GSCs were dissociated with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions; cells (0.5 × 106/condition) were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline; and nonspecific binding was blocked using 2% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Antibodies and their corresponding controls were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 2% goat serum/phosphate-buffered saline, and cells (10,000/recording) were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD133 (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and phycoerythrin/Cy5-conjugated anti-CD117 (c-Kit; BD Biosciences) antibodies were employed following the manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA Detection and Quantification—mRNA was obtained with an RNeasy Protect kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) using an RNase-free DNase kit. cDNA was subsequently obtained using a SuperScript first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science), and amplification of cDNA was performed with the following primers: human CB1, CGT GGG CAG CCT GTT CCT CA (sense) and CAT GCG GGC TTG GTC TGG (antisense; 403-bp product); human CB2, CGC CGG AAG CCC TCA TAC C (sense) and CCT CAT TCG GGC CAT TCC TG (antisense; 502-bp product); human fatty acid amide hydrolase, TGG GAA AGG CCT GGG AAG TGA ACA (sense) and GCC GCA GAT GCC GCA GAA GGA G (antisense; 458-bp product); human monoacylglycerol lipase, ACC CTG GGC TTC CTG TCT TCC TTC (sense) and TTC CTG CCG TGG CTG TCC TTT GAG (antisense; 564-bp product); human TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1), CGC CGC CAG CAC CGA GAA (sense) and ACC GAG TCC CTG GCG CTG ATG TC (antisense; 546-bp product); human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GGG AAG CTC ACT GGC ATG GCC TTC C (sense) and CAT GTG GGC CAT GAG GTC CAC CAC (antisense; 318-bp product); human Musashi-1, GAT GGT CAC TCG GAC GAA GAA (sense) and CAA ACC CTC TGT GCC TGT TG (antisense; 149-bp product); human nestin, GAG AGG GAG GAC AAA GTC CC (sense) and TCC CTC AGA GAC TAG CGC AT (antisense; 128-bp product); human NOTCH1, GCC GCC TTT GTG CTT CTG TTC (sense) and CCG GTG GTC TGT CTG GTC GTC (antisense; 251-bp product); human OCT4, GAC AAC AAT GAA AAT CTT CAG GAG A (sense) and TTC TGG CGC CGG TTA CAG AAC CA (antisense; 217-bp product); and human SOX2, GCA CAT GAA CGG CTG GAG CAA CG (sense) and TGC TGC GAG TAG GAC ATG CTG TAG G (antisense; 206-bp product). CB1 and CB2 receptor PCR amplifications were performed under the following conditions: 93 °C for 1 min; two rounds at 59 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 93 °C for 30 s; two rounds at 57 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 93 °C for 30 s; and 35 cycles at 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 93 °C for 30 s. Finally, after a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min, PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed with TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplifications were run in a 7700 real-time PCR system, and the values obtained were adjusted using 18 S RNA levels as a reference. cDNA Arrays—Total RNA was extracted from vehicle- or HU-210-treated GBM-GSCs cells, and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with Oligotex resin (Qiagen Inc.) and reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-33P]dATP for the generation of radiolabeled cDNA probes. Purified radiolabeled probes were hybridized to stem gene array membranes (GEArray Q series, SuperArray Bioscience Corp., Frederick, MD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 5See www.superarray.com for a detailed list of the genes analyzed. Hybridization signals were detected using a PhosphorImager and analyzed using Phoretix housekeeping genes on the blots as internal controls for normalization. The selection criteria were set conservatively throughout the process, and the genes selected were required to exhibit at least a 50% change in expression. Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Aguado T. Monory K. Palazuelos J. Stella N. Cravatt B. Lutz B. Marsicano G. Kokaia Z. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1704-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cleared cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Following incubation with primary antibodies, blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. Loading controls were performed with anti-α-tubulin antibody. Densitometric quantification of the luminograms was performed using a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) and MultiAnalyst software. Identification of Endocannabinoids in GSCs—Samples were dissolved in 1 volume of high pressure liquid chromatography-grade methanol and precipitated with 1 volume of acetone, and non-miscible material was filtered. The supernatant was evaporated, and the residue was partitioned between chloroform and water. A preparative TLC plate (Silica Gel 60 F24, 1 mm) was pre-developed with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Then, the residue of the chloroform layer was redissolved and applied to a Finnigan LCQ MS detector. Detection was performed using the electrospray ionization technique with the full-scan mass spectrometric mode, providing a full spectrum of samples between m/z 100 and 550. The rest of the mixture was loaded onto a TLC plate (40:6:1 (v/v) chloroform/petroleum ether/methanol) with synthetic anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol as references. The plate was scrapped, and after methanol extraction, filtrates were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with an electron impact detector (Hewlett-Packard G1800 GCD HP-5971) after derivatization with the silylating agent N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to form trimethylsilyl ethers at free hydroxyl groups. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence was performed in 10-μm tumor sections or in cultured cells as described previously (17Blázquez C. González-Feria L. Álvarez L. Casanova L. Guzmán M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Rueda D. Navarro B. Martínez-Serrano A. Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46645-46650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with the indicated antibodies and their corresponding secondary antibodies, either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody highly cross-adsorbed with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). CB receptor expression was determined with anti-rabbit secondary antibody highly cross-adsorbed with Alexa Fluor 594. The number of positive cells was normalized to the total cell number identified by counterstaining with TOTO-3 iodide or Hoechst 33342. GSC differentiation was determined in a minimum of five tumor sections. The human origin of the cells immunostained with the different neural markers was confirmed by double labeling with anti-human nucleus antibody (Chemicon). Tumor section CD133 staining was performed with non-conjugated antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) as described (7Singh S.K. Clarke I.D. Terasaki M. Bonn V.E. Hawkins C. Squire J. Dirks P.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5821-5828PubMed Google Scholar) and for in vitro cells after 50 mm ClNH4 incubation for autofluorescence treatment. Preparations were examined using Leica software and a Leica SP2 acoustical optical beam splitter microscope with two passes with a Kalman filter and a 1024X1024 collection box. Statistical Analysis—The results shown represent the means ± S.E. of the number of experiments indicated in every case. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance, and post hoc analysis was performing using Student’s t test. Glioma-derived Stem Cells Express CB Receptors—To investigate the potential effects of cannabinoids on GSCs, we first analyzed whether these cells express CB receptors. GSCs derived from GBM biopsies and human glioma U87MG and U373MG cell lines were cultured and generated neurosphere structures equivalent to those formed by normal neural stem cells (Fig. 1A). Clonal GSC cultures were subjected to subsequent neurosphere passages and showed unlimited self-renewal ability (supplemental Fig. 1A). Thus, we characterized in detail their stem-like cell characteristics. Immunostaining evidenced a high expression of the neural stem cell markers Musashi-1 and nestin (Fig. 1A), with many cells coexpressing both proteins (supplemental Fig. 1B). In addition, flow cytometry analysis showed a CD133-positive cell population (supplemental Fig. 1C), the size of which depended on the tumor of origin. The CB1 and CB2 receptors were shown by double immunofluorescence to colocalize in nestin-positive cells both in vitro (Fig. 1A) and in glioma xenografts (Fig. 1B); the CB1 and CB2 receptors were present in 49 ± 5 and 31 ± 7% of the nestin-positive cells, respectively. Western blotting of GSC cultures was also used to analyze the presence of CB receptors (Fig. 1C). Reverse transcription PCR analysis confirmed the expression of stemness markers, including CD133, nestin, Musashi-1, SOX2, and NOTCH1, and the pluripotency embryonic stem cell marker OCT4 in GSCs (Fig. 1D). These findings correlated with enhanced CB receptor expression of GBM- and U87MG-GSC populations compared with their respective differentiated counterparts. In particular, GSCs were significantly enriched in CB2 receptors at both the transcript and protein levels, in line with the correlation between astrocytoma malignancy and CB2 receptor expression (16Sánchez C. de Ceballos M.L. Gómez del Pulgar T. Rueda D. Corbacho C. Velasco G. Galve-Roperh I. Huffman J.W. Ramón y Cajal S. Guzmán M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5784-5789PubMed Google Scholar). Other elements of the endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system were also present in GSCs, including TRPV1 and the hydrolases monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydrolase, enzymes responsible for eCB degradation (Fig. 1D). Finally, GSCs were evaluated for their ability to produce endogenous cannabinoid ligands upon incubation with the calcium ionophore A23187 (5 μm, 2 min) and subsequent identification by LCQ mass spectrometry (supplemental Table 1). Several major species of 2-monoacylglycerols were detected, specifically palmitoylglycerol and stearoylglycerol. In addition, 2-arachidonoylglycerol and N-arachidonoylglycine, a metabolite of anandamide, were present in the samples at trace levels. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis after derivatization with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide confirmed the data obtained by LCQ mass spectrometry (supplemental Table 1). CB Receptor Activation Contributes to the Regulation of Glioma Stem Cell Gene Expression—To identify the potential action of cannabinoids on GSCs, we investigated the changes in gene expression induced by the synthetic cannabinoid agonist HU-210 (30 nm) in GBM-GSCs. HU-210 significantly altered the expression of 11 genes (Fig. 2A) of the 266 genes analyzed. Among them, seven genes involved in regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation (CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), CDKN1B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B), FGFR1 (FGF receptor 1), FGFR3 (FGF receptor-3), EGF receptor, EGF, and integrin α4) were down-regulated by cannabinoid stimulation. In addition, the transcript levels of neuronal MAP2 and the tumor suppressor RBL1 (retinoblastoma-like 1) were increased. These results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR analysis of three transcripts (Fig. 2B) and suggest that CB receptor activation regulates essential GSC functions such as cell proliferation and differentiation. However, GSC proliferation and self-renewal were not affected by cannabinoid stimulation during several neurosphere passages (data not shown). The impact of CB receptor activation on differentiation-related genes was therefore determined by quantitative PCR analysis. HU-210 treatment increased the mRNA levels of the glia-specific markers GFAP and S-100β inaCB1 receptor-dependent manner as evidenced by SR141716 antagonism (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). In addition, CB1 receptor activation resulted in increased expression of the early neuronal marker β-tubulin III (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Cannabinoid regulation of glioma stem-like cell gene expression in vitro. A-C, real-time PCR analysis of GFAP, S-100β, andβ-tubulin III (β-tubIII) expression, respectively, in GSCs treated with 30 nm HU-210, 2 μm SR141716 (SR1), or both and normalized to 18 S RNA transcript levels.

We have used small interfering RNAs to suppress HSP27 expression in HeLa cells and fibroblasts and found that it is required for pro-inflammatory cell signaling and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. HSP27 is needed for the activation by interleukin (IL)-1 of TAK1 and downstream signaling by p38 MAPK, JNK, and their activators (MKK-3, -4, -6, -7) and IKKβ. IL-1-induced ERK activation appears to be independent of HSP27. HSP27 is required for both IL-1 and TNF-induced signaling pathways for which the most upstream common signaling protein is TAK1. HSP27 is also required for IL-1-induced expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators, cyclooxygenase-2, IL-6, and IL-8. HSP27 functions to drive cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-6 expression by augmenting the activation of the kinase downstream of p38 MAPK, MK2, resulting in stabilization of cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-6 mRNAs.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HSP27 (or HSPB1) is a widely expressed 27-kDa protein and one of ten members of the small HSP family. These proteins include the lens proteins αA- and αB crystallin, and they all share a conserved C-terminal motif, the α-crystallin domain (2Kappe G. Franck E. Verschuure P. Boelens W.C. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The function of HSP27 is poorly understood, but recently missense mutations in the gene encoding it have been associated with the human neurodegenerative disorders, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (3Evgrafov O.V. Mersiyanova I. Irobi J. Van Den Bosch L. Dierick I. Leung C.L. Schagina O. Verpoorten N. Van Impe K. Fedotov V. Dadali E. Auer-Grumbach M. Windpassinger C. Wagner K. Mitrovic Z. Hilton-Jones D.

However, the role of the HSP27 in these diseases is unclear. HSP27 is phosphorylated in response to heat shock, cell stresses, pro-inflammatory stimuli, and various agonists including phorbol 12-myristoyl 13-acetate (PMA) (4Welch W.J. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of the protein by MK2 has been suggested to modulate different functional properties of HSP27, including oligomerization; the unphosphorylated protein exists as large ∼700-kDa oligomers (e.g. 24-mers), which dissociate to form dimers upon phosphorylation (13Kim K.K.

It is cytoprotective against heat shock (16Landry J. Chretien P. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. J.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2661-2667PubMed Google Scholar). HSP27 possesses chaperone-like activity and refolds denatured proteins, preventing their aggregation (21Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced glutathione-dependent chaperone activity against misfolded or oxidized proteins has been suggested to be responsible for the HSP27 protective role (22Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Several other anti-apoptotic functions have also been proposed (23Concannon C.G. Gorman A.M. Samali A. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar); however, at present, there is no common mechanism that explains the cytoprotective function of HSP27. HSP27 may also regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. Overexpression of HSP27 stabilizes actin filaments, and this process appears to require phosphorylation (24Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p38 MAPK pathway, in addition to phosphorylating HSP27, plays a key role in the induction of many genes of the inflammatory response. An important function is to stabilize otherwise unstable mRNAs, thereby increasing their expression (26Dean J.L. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The mechanism involves AU-rich elements (ARE) present in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs that direct instability but also allow for stabilization by p38 MAPK (27Winzen R. Kracht M.

Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The fact that HSP27 is a substrate of MK2 makes it a candidate for involvement in the inflammatory response. Although its phosphorylation following IL-1 treatment of cells was first described some 20 years ago (30Kaur P. Saklatvala J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), its function in inflammation remains unknown. To examine the role of HSP27 in the inflammatory response we suppressed the expression of the protein in HeLa cells and human fibroblasts by RNA interference (RNAi). We found that HSP27 is needed for the induction by IL-1 of COX-2 and IL-6 protein and mRNA. In HSP27-depleted cells, the inhibition of COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA was a result of instability of these mRNAs, which was caused by reduced MK2 activation. These findings led us to uncover an unexpected function for the small heat shock protein in pro-inflammatory cell signaling. Cell Culture—HeLa cells and human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units ml–1 penicillin and 100 μgml–1 streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Oligonucleotides—21-nucleotide double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides with 3′-dTdT overhangs were designed according to Tuschl and co-workers (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). They were synthesized in 2′-ACE protected form (Dharmacon) and were deprotected according to the manufacturer’s instructions. dsRNAs used were as follows: Scramble 2 (Scr): 5′-CAGUCGCGUUUGCGACTGGdTdT-3′ HSP27#1: 5′-GGAUGGCGUGGUGGAGAUCdTdT-3′; HSP27#2: 5′-CGAGAUCACCAUCCCAGUCdTdT-3′; HSP27#3: 5′-GUGGUUAGGCGGCAGCAGCdTdT-3′; HSP27#4: 5′-GAUCCGGCACACUGCGGACdTdT-3′; HSP27#5: 5′-UGCCCAAGCUAGCCACGCAdTdT-3′; HSP27#6: 5′-UCCGAUGAGACUGCCGCCAdTdT-3′; TAK1 siRNA: 5′-UGGCUUAUCUUACACUGGAdTdT-3′. siRNA Transfection—HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates (105 cells per well) and cultured for 24 h. Cells were transfected with siRNAs at a final concentration of 10 nm using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After addition of liposome-siRNA complexes, cells were incubated in a final volume of 1 ml of serum-free OptiMEM I (Invitrogen) for 4 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in 1.5 ml of 5% fetal calf serum/OptiMEM I including 100 units ml–1 penicillin and 100 μgml–1 streptomycin. Cells described as untransfected were subjected to identical changes of the culture medium but were not treated with lipid or siRNA. Human fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 104 cells per well) and cultured for 24 h. The cells were transfected with dsRNA (10 nm final concentration) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions supplied. Cells were re-transfected 24-h later in the same way. Cells were stimulated and harvested for the times indicated at 72 h after the initial transfection. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μgml–1 aprotinin, 10 μm E64, 2 μg ml–1 pepstatin, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm microcystin, 2 mm dithiothreitol), and protein was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were stained with rabbit anti-COX-2 antibody (Alexis), a mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody DM-1A (Sigma-Aldrich), a mouse monoclonal antibody against actin (Sigma), a rabbit antiserum raised against MKK3/6 (32Lasa M.

Rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2, rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, rabbit anti-phospho-MKK3/6 antibodies, and mouse anti-phospho-JNK1/2 monoclonal antibody were from Cell Signaling, and secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were from Dako. Protein detection was carried out by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations in medium were determined by ELISA using a kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) ELISA kit was from R&D Systems and was used according to the instructions supplied. All samples were developed using the TMB peroxidase substrate system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), and the reactions were stopped using 1 m H2SO4. Absorbance was read on an ELISA Multiskan Biochromic plate reader (Labsystems). Data were analyzed using Ascent software (Labsystems). RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—RNA was isolated from cells using an RNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 8 μg of HeLa cell RNA was electrophoresed on denaturing formaldehyde/1% agarose gels with 0.41 m formaldehyde. RNA was capillary-transferred onto Hybond XL membranes (GE Healthcare) and fixed by UV cross-linking. For cDNA probes, membranes were prehybridized for 3 h and then hybridized overnight with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe at 42 °C in Ultrahyb (Ambion). Blots were then washed three times for 1 h at 52 °C with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS, 1× SSC/0.1% SDS, and 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS. For GAPDH riboprobe pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washes were carried out at 65 °C. RNA was visualized and quantified using an FLA-2000 phosphorimager (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). The GAPDH riboprobe template was from BD Biosciences and prepared according to Ref. 34Dean J.L. Sarsfield S.J. Tsounakou E. Saklatvala J. J. Biol.

IL-6 and COX-2 probes have been described previously (35Ridley S.H. Dean J.L. Sarsfield S.J. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J.

Cell Viability Assay—3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (0.5 mg ml–1 final concentration) was added to 1.5 ml of cell culture medium, and cells were incubated for 4 h. 1.5 ml of 10% SDS in 10 mm HCl was then added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance at 620 nm was measured using an ELISA Multiskan Biochromic plate reader (Labsystems). Kinase Assays—For MK2 and p38 MAPK, these were performed as described previously (36Dean J.L. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). JNK was immunoprecipitated in an identical fashion but using an antiserum against long JNK2 (37Finch A. Davis W. Carter W.G. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 275-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p38 MAPK and JNK assays were performed using either recombinant His-tagged MK2 or GST-ATF-2 substrates, respectively. MKK4 was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit antiserum (sc-964; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MKK7 was immunoprecipitated with a previously described antiserum (37Finch A. Davis W. Carter W.G. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 275-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MKK4 and MKK7 were immunoprecipitated with a buffer lacking deoxycholate but using protein G beads, and they were assayed using GST-JNK2 (K55R) as previously described (37Finch A. Davis W. Carter W.G. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 275-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IKKβ was assayed for after immunoprecipitation with an anti-IKKγ (764) antibody (BD Pharmingen) in lysis buffer containing 400 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitates were washed in the same buffer and assayed using GST-IκBα as substrate (gift from Michael Karin, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA). TAK1 was immunoprecipitated with a sheep antibody against TAB1 and assayed using recombinant MBP-MKK6 (both gifts from Mark Windheim, MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit, University of Dundee) as a substrate as described previously (38Cheung P.C. Campbell D.G. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5793-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). HSP27 Is Required for the Induction of COX-2, IL-6, and IL-8 Proteins by IL-1—To investigate whether HSP27 is required for the regulation of inflammatory response genes, its expression was suppressed in HeLa cells by RNAi, and the induction by IL-1 of COX-2, IL-6, and IL-8 was measured. Cells were transiently transfected separately with six different siRNA targeted against HSP27 (HSP27#1–6) or with a scrambled double-stranded oligonucleotide (Scr) as a control or were left untransfected. Cells were incubated for 72 h to allow for suppression of HSP27 protein. They were then incubated for a further 4 h with or without IL-1. Culture medium was then removed, and cells were harvested, lysed, and HSP27, COX-2, and α-tubulin (as a loading control) were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). All siRNAs, except for HSP27#4, suppressed HSP27 protein expression, with HSP27#2 and HSP27#5 as the most effective (Fig. 1A). IL-1 induced COX-2 protein to a similar extent in untransfected cells and in cells transfected with the scrambled oligonucleotide (Fig. 1A). The induction of COX-2 protein by IL-1 was inhibited by four different siRNAs but not by HSP27#3 or HSP27#4 (Fig. 1A). It is possible that HSP27#3 exerts off-target effects that block the inhibition of COX-2 upon HSP27 depletion. Because HSP27#2 and HSP27#5 siRNAs were the most effective at depleting HSP27 protein, they were selected for subsequent experiments. The effect of depleting HSP27 on IL-1-induced PGE2 secretion was also examined. The amount of PGE2 secreted following a 4-h IL-1 treatment was inhibited by 47 and 60% by HSP27#2 and HSP27#5 siRNAs compared with untransfected cells (data not shown). The amounts of IL-6 and IL-8 secreted into the culture medium in response to IL-1 were also measured (Fig. 1, B and C). These were reduced in cells in which HSP27 expression was suppressed: siRNAs HSP27#2 and #5 inhibited IL-6 secretion by 72 ± 8% and 81 ± 7%, respectively (Fig. 1B) and reduced IL-8 secretion by 65 ± 4% and 68 ± 9%, respectively (Fig. 1C). HSP27 Is Required for Induction by IL-1 of COX-2 Protein in Human Fibroblasts—To investigate whether HSP27 functions in inflammatory gene expression in cells other than HeLa cells, HSP27 expression was examined in different cell types. HSP27 was undetectable in human monocytes, human T cells, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, and the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage-like cell line (Fig. 1D). HSP27 could not be detected in lipopolysaccharide-treated monocytes or macrophages (data not shown). It was expressed to a similar degree in HeLa cells and human fibroblasts and was also expressed in the 293 cell line (Fig. 1D). HSP27 was also detected in human endothelial cells and human chondrocytes (data not shown). RNAi was used to test whether HSP27 functions in inflammatory gene expression in human fibroblasts. A single round of transfection by lipofection was found to be insufficient for strong depletion of HSP27 protein (data not shown). The cells were therefore transfected twice by lipofection, with an interval of 24 h between transfections, to improve depletion of HSP27. The suppression achieved by HSP27#2 after sequential transfection of the fibroblasts was still not as complete as in HeLa cells (compare Fig. 1, A and E) and was not sufficient to inhibit COX-2 expression (Fig. 1E). However in fibroblasts, HSP27#5 strongly suppressed HSP27 expression and, also inhibited the induction of COX-2 protein by IL-1 (Fig. 1E). Thus the pro-inflammatory function of HSP27 is not limited to HeLa cells but also occurs in human fibroblasts. HSP27 Is Required for the Induction of COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA by IL-1—Suppression of HSP27 expression might inhibit the translation of COX-2 and IL-6 or reduce their mRNA levels. To test this, cells were treated with the siRNAs as before and were left unstimulated or stimulated with IL-1. The cells were harvested after 2 h, and RNA was isolated and examined by Northern blotting. IL-1 treatment induced COX-2 mRNA in untransfected and Scr-transfected cells to a similar extent (Fig. 2A). HSP27#2 and HSP27#5 inhibited COX-2 mRNA by 50 and 56%, respectively, compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 2A). Stronger inhibition was seen for IL-6 mRNA (68% inhibition for both siRNAs) (Fig. 2A). The inhibition of IL-1-induced IL-6 mRNA (Fig. 2A) reflected the reduction in IL-6 protein (Fig. 1B). Therefore, HSP27 does not appear to regulate IL-6 translation. These results indicate that HSP27 regulates either the transcription or the stability of these inflammatory transcripts. Northern blots were also performed to measure the degree of suppression of HSP27 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Both siRNAs suppressed HSP27 mRNA (HSP27#2: 65 ± 8%; HSP27#5: 71 ± 7%). HSP27 has previously been reported to have a cytoprotective role. It was possible that the inhibition of expression of inflammatory proteins in response to IL-1 was caused by the death of cells in which HSP27 expression was suppressed. To check this, the viability of oligonucleotide-treated cells was measured by the MTT assay. In three experiments, Scr and HSP27#2 had no effect on cell viability, and only a small reduction was seen with HSP27#5 (14 ± 3%). Decrease in viability did not account for the differences in COX-2, IL-6, and IL-8 expression. HSP27 Is Needed for Stabilization of IL-1-induced COX-2 and IL-6 mRNAs—Because HSP27 is a component of the p38 MAPK signaling cascade and this pathway has an important post-transcriptional role in inflammatory gene expression, we examined the stability of COX-2 and IL-6 mRNAs in HSP27-depleted cells. Cells were transfected with dsRNA as before, then stimulated with IL-1 for 1.5 h. Actinomycin D was added to block transcription, and cells were then incubated further and harvested at different times. RNA was isolated and examined by Northern blotting to measure mRNA decay rates. After 1.5 h of IL-1 treatment, COX-2 mRNA in Scr-transfected cells was stable; however, in HSP27#2-suppressed cells, it was reduced in amount and decayed rapidly (Fig. 2B). IL-6 mRNA behaved similarly (Fig. 2B). The stability of various other mRNAs (Bcl-x, GADD45, c-Fos, p21, Bax, Mcl-1, and L32) was unaffected by HSP27 depletion (supplemental Fig. S1) showing that of the mRNAs tested, the effect is not general and may be specific to COX-2 and IL-6 mRNAs. Overexpression of HSP27 has previously been shown to protect against the cytotoxic effects of actinomycin D (39Huot J. Roy G. Lambert H. Chretien P. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5245-5252PubMed Google Scholar). To check whether actinomycin D affected the viability of cells in which HSP27 protein was suppressed, MTT assays were performed. Scr- and HSP27#2-transfected cells were left untreated, treated with IL-1 for 2 h, treated with actinomycin D for 1.5 h, or treated with IL-1 for 2 h followed by actinomycin D for 1.5 h. In two separate experiments, cell viability was unaffected by any of these treatments (data not shown). Thus the instability of COX-2 and IL-6 mRNAs in HSP27-suppressed cells was not caused by death of the cells, which might have been caused by actinomycin D. HSP27 Is Required for Activation of MK2 by IL-1—It is possible that suppression of HSP27 protein (which is phosphorylated by MK2) was affecting upstream signaling by the p38 MAPK pathway. To examine this possibility, Scr or HSP27#5-transfected cells were stimulated with IL-1 for different times. Activation of MK2 was measured in lysates by immunoprecipitating it and assaying for its ability to phosphorylate recombinant HSP27 in vitro (Fig. 3). MK2 activity peaked at 30 min after IL-1 treatment and was inhibited by 56% by HSP27#5 siRNA (Fig. 3). Because MK2 activity is required for stabilization of COX-2 and IL-6 mRNAs, the reduced stability of these transcripts in HSP27-depleted cells is entirely consistent with inhibition of MK2 following HSP27 depletion. HSP27 Is Needed for Full Activation by IL-1 of p38 MAPK and JNK, but Not ERK—Because HSP27 regulates MK2, the activation by IL-1 of its upstream activator, p38 MAPK, was measured in Scr and HSP27#5-transfected cells. p38 MAPK activity was measured by immunocomplex kinase assay using recombinant MK2 as substrate (Fig. 4A). p38 MAPK activity was maximal at 30 min after IL-1 stimulation and was inhibited by 59 ± 14% following HSP27 depletion (Fig. 4A). The reduction in p38 MAPK activity in HSP27 knockdown cells was not a result of reduced p38 MAPK expression as this was the same in Scr- and HSP27#5-transfected cells. JNK is a MAPK, which, like p38 MAPK, is strongly activated by inflammatory stimuli including IL-1. ERK, the first discovered MAPK, is typically activated by mitogens, but is also activated by IL-1 in many cells. To find out whether the effect of HSP27 depletion on signaling is limited to the p38 MAPK pathway or affects the other MAPK pathways, the activation of JNK and ERK was examined. JNK was immunoprecipitated from dsRNA-transfected cell lysates and assayed using recombinant ATF-2 protein as a substrate (Fig. 4B). As for p38 MAPK, JNK was strongly activated by IL-1 in Scr-transfected cells, peaking at 30 min IL-1 (Fig. 4B). Peak JNK activity was reduced by 64 ± 2% in HSP27-depleted cells compared with Scr-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). Thus the role of HSP27 in regulating signaling is not restricted to the p38 MAPK pathway. ERK activation was assessed by Western blotting lysates wit"
https://openalex.org/W2111234060,"Calcium mishandling in Duchenne dystrophic muscle suggested that dystrophin, a membrane-associated cytoskeleton protein, might regulate calcium signaling cascade such as calcium influx pathway. It was previously shown that abnormal calcium entries involve uncontrolled stretch-activated currents and store-operated Ca2+ currents supported by TRPC1 channels. Moreover, our recent work demonstrated that reintroduction of minidystrophin in dystrophic myotubes restores normal capacitative calcium entries (CCEs). However, until now, no molecular link between the dystrophin complex and calcium entry channels has been described. This study is the first to show by coimmunoprecipitation assays the molecular association of TRPC1 with dystrophin and alpha1-syntrophin in muscle cells. TRPC1 was also associated with alpha1-syntrophin in dystrophic muscle cells independently of dystrophin. Furthermore, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays showed that TRPC1 binds to the alpha1-syntrophin PDZ domain. Transfected recombinant alpha1-syntrophin formed a complex with TRPC1 channels and restored normal CCEs in dystrophic muscle cells. We suggest that normal regulation of CCEs in skeletal muscle depends on the association between TRPC1 channels and alpha1-syntrophin that may anchor the store-operated channels to the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). The loss of this molecular association could participate in the calcium alterations observed in dystrophic muscle cells.

We previously discovered that DM in vivo and HG in vitro induced the translocation of Hsp90α to the outside of aortic endothelial cells. In this report we tested the hypothesis that translocation of Hsp90α is responsible for the decline in NO production observed in HG-treated cells. We found that HG increased phosphorylation of Hsp90α in a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-dependent manner, and that this event was required for translocation of Hsp90α in porcine aortic endothelial cells. Furthermore, preventing translocation of Hsp90α protected from the HG-induced decline in eNOS·Hsp90α complex and NO production. Notably, DM increased phosphorylation of Hsp90α and reduced its association with eNOS in the aortic endothelium of diabetic rats. These studies suggest that translocation of Hsp90α is a novel mechanism by which HG and DM impair eNOS activity and thereby reduce NO production.

Vascular NO dilates all types of blood vessels. It also inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion, and leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall (3Moncada S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

This enzyme is also tightly regulated by specific interactions with inhibitory and activating proteins such as caveolin-1 and Hsp90, respectively. The binding of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) to eNOS enhances eNOS activation, assists with the intracellular trafficking of eNOS, and helps activate eNOS by dissociating it from caveolin-1 (12Garcia-Cardena G.

Several studies have demonstrated that hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus (DM) causes a loss of endothelium-derived NO in both animals (17Booth G. Stalker T.J. Lefer A.M. Scalia R.

Creager M.A. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1695-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), but the underlining mechanism is poorly understood. DM does not influence the overall eNOS protein level or its mRNA level (21Felaco M. Grilli A. De Lutiis M.A. Patruno A. Libertini N. Taccardi A.A. Di Napoli P. Di Giulio C. Barbacane R. Conti P. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2001; 31: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar). One potential mechanism may be the reduced association of eNOS with Hsp90 (19Stalker T.J. Gong Y. Scalia R. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is an ATP-dependent chaperone that interacts with over 100 proteins (22Csermely P. Schnaider T. Soti C. Prohaszka Z. Nardai G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 129-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 23Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J.

DM induces an increase in the amount of Hsp90α at the luminal surface of the aorta, and this event could be mimicked by treating cultured vascular endothelial cells with high glucose (HG) (28Lei H. Romeo G. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression of Hsp90 on the cell surface has also been published by several other laboratories (29Eustace B.K. Sakurai T. Stewart J.K. Yimlamai D. Unger C. Zehetmeier C. Lain B. Torella C.

In this report, we tested the hypothesis that HG reduced NO production by translocating Hsp90α out of the cell and thereby reducing the amount of Hsp90α available to interact with and activate eNOS. Our findings strongly support this hypothesis and suggest that a similar mechanism operates in DM. Animals and Aorta Isolation—Sprague-Dawley male rats were made diabetic by injecting streptozotocin (55 mg/kg body weight) into the tail vein. Insulin was given as needed (28Lei H. Romeo G. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to achieve a slow weight gain while maintaining hyperglycemia and glycosuria. Glycohemoglobin was measured (Glyc-Affin, Pierce, Rockford, IL) to assess the degree of hyperglycemia (17 ± 1.9% in diabetic versus 4.5 ± 0.5% in control rats, p < 0.00001). The thoracic aortas were isolated from sacrificed rats, which had endured 5 or 6 months of DM, or age- and sex-matched controls. Before sacrifice, the rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (70/9 mg/kg body weight), and then perfused with pre-warmed PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) through the left ventricle using a catheter connected to a peristaltic pump (5 min, 100 mm Hg). The thoracic aorta was harvested, freed of periadventitial fat, dissected longitudinally, and then washed in ice-cold PBS. The protocol for the use of animals was approved by the Schepens Animal Care and Use Committee.

Propidium idodide was obtained from BD Biosciences, and protein G-agarose was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The following antibodies were obtained from commercial sources: phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody (number 9621, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and anti-eNOS mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories); goat anti-Hsp90α polyclonal antibody and non-immune goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences); and fluorescein isothiocyante-conjugated AffiniPure sheep anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The crude polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised against a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein including the human Hsp90α-N-terminal (1–284 aa) or C-terminal (285–732) domains (Alpha Diagnostic Intl. Inc., San Antonio, TX). Similarly, the Ras GTP-activating protein (RasGAP) antibody was a crude rabbit antisera against a GST fusion protein including the SH2-SH3-SH2 region of the human RasGAP as previously described (32Rosenkranz S.

Cell Culture and Preparation of Cell Lysates—The porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) were from Dr. Lena Claesson-Welsh (Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden). They were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose, Invitrogen), F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham's) (Invitrogen), which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA). To achieve “HG,” d-glucose was added to the medium to a final concentration of 30 mmol/liter; “normal glucose” was 5 mmol/liter. The “HG treatment” consisted of a 2-week incubation in the HG-containing medium. GPG293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 2.25 μmol/liter tetracycline (Sigma), 3.67 μmol/liter puromycin (Sigma), 43 μmol/liter G418 (Sigma), and 16.7 mmol/liter HEPES (Invitrogen). The medium used to collect virus from these cells was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 16.7 mmol/liter HEPES (33Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). To prepare total cell lysates, cells were grown to 90% confluence, placed on ice, and washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed by adding extraction buffer (EB) (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 3.07 μmol/liter aprotinin, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmol/liter Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100). The cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g, the pellet was discarded, and the soluble fraction used as the total cell lysates. Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Hsp90α Fusion Proteins—The following primers synthesized by MWG Biotech Inc. (High Point, NC) were used to PCR amplify the desired regions of human Hsp90α. Hsp90α N-terminal (H90N, 1–284 aa) and Hsp90α N-terminal T89A (H90NT89A, 1–284 aa) (sense, 5′-TTAGGGATCCTGCCTGAGGAAACCCAGACC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TGAGCTCTGCGGCCGCTTAGTACTTTTCCTTAATCTT-3′); Hsp90α C-terminal (H90C, 285–732 aa) (sense, 5′-GAAAGGATCCTCGATCAAGAAGAGCTCAAC-3′, and antisense 5′-ATCCCTCAGCGGCCGCTTAGTCTACTTCTTCCAT-3′). The template for these PCR was human Hsp90α or mutated human Hsp90α T89A in pBluescript. The PCR products were subcloned into the GST expression vector pGEX-5x-1 (Amersham Biosciences) that had been cut with BamHI/NotI. The final plasmids were sequenced by the Massachusetts General Hospital DNA Sequencing Core (Cambridge, MA). Expression of the fusion proteins was induced with 0.5 mmol/liter isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 5 h. The fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. A single Coomassie-stainable species of the appropriate molecular mass was detected when the purified material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. PKA Phosphorylation Assay—Full-length Hsp90α protein was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, BC, Canada), whereas the GST-H90N, GST-H90T89A, and GST-H90C fusion proteins were generated as described above. For each of the substrates, 100 ng was incubated with or without 1 μl (2500 units) of the catalytic subunit of PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in kinase buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/liter ATP) in a total volume of 25 μl at 30 °C for 1 h (34Xie J. Lee J.A. Kress T.L. Mowry K.L. Black D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8776-8781Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by lowering the temperature to 0 °C or by adding sample buffer. Following the kinase assay the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot using a phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody. The membranes were stripped and then reprobed (28Lei H. Romeo G. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Rahimi N. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3401-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using anti-H90N and H90C antibodies. The Western blots were developed using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting data were scanned and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For the stoichiometry experiments full-length Hsp90α was phosphorylated as described above, except that the concentration of unlabeled ATP was 20 μmol/liter, 20 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP (6.6 × 10–6 μmol/liter) was added and the reactions were run for 3 h. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into Hsp90α was determined by scintillation counting of the excised Hsp90α band. Overexpression of PKA—A pcDNA 3.1 (+)-Flag-PKA plasmid containing the full-length mouse PKA (1047 bp) was kindly provided by Dr. Jiuyong Xie (University of Manitoba, Canada). The entire coding region of catalytic PKA (including the FLAG tag), was subcloned into pLPCX retroviral vector (BD Biosciences). The plasmids were transfected into 293GPG cells to obtain virus and the resulting viruses were used to infect PAECs as outlined previously (28Lei H. Romeo G. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Short Interfering RNA (siRNA)—To choose the region to target, we used the siRNA Sequence Selector software (BD Biosciences). We selected 3 target sequences specific for porcine Hsp90α (GenBank™ U94395): 1, GAGAAGGAATCTGAGGATA (769–788 bp); 2, TTGGCCGAAGATAAGAGA (1306–1325); and 3, AGAAGCACCTGGAGATAAA (1919–1938 bp). The corresponding oligonucleotides, flanked with BamHI and EcoRI, were subcloned into the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ retroviral vector (BD Biosciences). The siRNA retroviruses were generated as described above. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Hsp90α—Mutants were introduced into Hsp90α using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers used for the Thr to Ala substitution at residue 89 were 5′-GATCGAACTCTTGCAATTGTGGATACTGGAATTGGAATGACCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGGTCATTCCAATTCCAGTATCCACAATTGCAAGAGTTCGATC-3′. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing and then subcloned into the pLNCX2 (BD Biosciences) retroviral vector. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—To immunoprecipitate the population of Hsp90α on the cell surface, PAECs were washed 3 times with cold PBS, and then the intact cells were incubated with an anti-Hsp90α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal goat IgG (2 μg/ml in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS) for 30 min on ice with gentle shaking. The unbound antibody was removed by washing 3 times with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed by adding EB (1 ml/per dish), the dishes were scraped and the insoluble material was separated by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). The clarified supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) per sample for 2 h. The beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of EB buffer each time, and resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer. To immunoprecipitate Hsp90α from all cellular compartments, cells were first lysed in EB buffer, and the anti-Hsp90α antibody was added to the lysate. The remainder of the immunoprecipitation procedure was the same as described above. To immunoprecipitate Hsp90α from the aortic endothelium, lysates from the aortic endothelial layer of 5 diabetic or nondiabetic rats were obtained as described previously (28Lei H. Romeo G. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and then incubated with 3 μg of either an anti-Hsp90α antibody or non-immune IgG for 4 h at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were captured on protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of EB buffer each time, and resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates from cultured cells were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody; the stripped membranes were reprobed using an anti-Hsp90α antibody. Immunoprecipitates from rat aortic endothelium were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody; the stripped membranes were reprobed using anti-Hsp90α and anti-eNOS antibody. To co-immunoprecipitate eNOS and Hsp90, the lysates prepared from PAECs cultured in normal glucose or HG for 2 weeks were incubated with anti-eNOS antibody (0.5 μg) or non-immune IgG as described above. The resulting samples were subjected to an anti-eNOS Western blot followed by an anti-Hsp90 Western blot. FACS Analysis—Following the desired experimental treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and detached with cell dissociation solution (Sigma). The cells were incubated with a goat anti-Hsp90α antibody or non-immune goat IgG for 1 h on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyante-conjugated AffiniPure mouse anti-goat secondary antibody for 30 min on ice, rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then stained with propidium iodide (BD Biosciences). The cells were finally analyzed by flow cytometry (20,000 events) in Coulter Beckman XL (Beckman Coulter Inc., Miami, FL). NO Assay—PAECs were cultured in normal glucose or HG for 2 weeks. The media were collected, and spun at 5,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were subjected to an NO assay following the protocol provided by the Griess reagent kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). This method involves the Griess diazotization reaction and spectrophotometric (at 548 nm) detection of nitrite formed by the spontaneous oxidation of NO under physiological conditions. Statistics—Comparisons were made using unpaired and paired t test; a confidence level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. HG Increased Phosphorylation of Hsp90α in a PKA-dependent Manner—Whereas DM is known to decrease NO bioavailability (6Lin K.Y. Ito A. Asagami T. Tsao P.S. Adimoolam S. Kimoto M. Tsuji H. Reaven G.M. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 2002; 106: 987-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 19Stalker T.J. Gong Y. Scalia R. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism has not be elucidated. Our observation that DM (and HG treatment of cultured endothelial cells) promoted translocation of an eNOS activator (Hsp90) (28Lei H. Romeo G. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggested that NO declines because of the translocation of an eNOS activator. To test this hypothesis we determined if preventing translocation of Hsp90α prevented the decline in NO production caused by HG. Because Hsp90α does not have a signal peptide, its translocation must proceed via a non-classical route used by other excreted proteins that also lack signal peptides such as basic fibroblast growth factor and galectin (36Nickel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Others have found that HG activates PKA in certain cell types (including vascular endothelial cells) (37Zhang Z.

Consequently, we speculated that HG promoted PKA phosphorylation of Hsp90α, resulting in its translocation out of the cell. To test this hypothesis, we searched for potential PKA phosphorylation sites within Hsp90α using the Scansite software. The results showed a low stringency PKA phosphorylation site (NKQDRTLT89IVDTGIG) at position 89. This PKA site (underlined amino acids) was identical in all vertebrate species examined (human, pig, hamster, mouse, and zebra fish). The commercially available phosphospecific PKA substrate antibody recognizes proteins containing RRXpS or RXXpT, and this antibody should recognize Hsp90α phosphorylated at Thr-89. The first step to test our hypothesis that HG induced PKA-dependent translocation of Hsp90α was to determine whether HG induced phosphorylation of proteins that can be recognized by this antibody. Indeed, we found that HG stimulated the phosphorylation of numerous proteins at a consensus PKA phosphorylation site (Fig. 1). To test if Hsp90α was one of these proteins, Hsp90α was immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blotting using the phosphospecific PKA substrate antibody. We found that HG increased phosphorylation of Hsp90α by 2.2 ± 0.2-fold (Fig. 2A). Blocking PKA activity by preincubating the cells with a PKA inhibitor (0.5 μmol/liter PKI for 12 h) reduced phosphorylation of Hsp90α in HG-treated cells (Fig. 2B). These data strongly suggested that the HG-induced phosphorylation of Hsp90α was PKA dependent. To test if PKA is capable of directly phosphorylating Hsp90α, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified PKA and either full-length Hsp90α or fusion proteins containing portions of Hsp90α. Full-length Hsp90α, or a GST fusion protein that included the N-terminal portion (1–284 aa) was readily phosphorylated in this in vitro setting (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we were unable to detect phosphorylation of the C-terminal fragment of Hsp90α (285–732 aa) (Fig. 3A). Thus PKA was capable of phosphorylating Hsp90α, and the phosphorylation site(s) was(were) within the first 284 amino acids. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of full-length Hsp90α was 15.6 ± 0.7% (supplemental materials Fig. S1). As mentioned above, there is a PKA phosphorylation site at position 89 of Hsp90α, and Hsp90α phosphorylated at this site would be recognized by phosphospecific PKA substrate antibody. Consistent with this idea is the observation that mutating Thr-89 to alanine (T89A) abrogated recognition of the in vitro phosphorylated GST fusion containing the N-terminal portion of Hsp90α by the phosphospecific PKA substrate antibody (Fig. 3B). These findings indicated that PKA directly phosphorylated Hsp90α at Thr-89. Translocation of Hsp90α Required Phosphorylation at Thr-89—If phosphorylation of Hsp90α by PKA promoted its translocation to the cell surface, then the phosphorylated form of Hsp90α should predominate on the cell surface. To test this idea we prepared Hsp90α immunoprecipitates from the cell surface or from total cell lysates, which contained both the cell surface and intracellular pools. Consistent with our previous observation (28Lei H. Romeo G. Kazlauskas A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) less than 10% of the total Hsp90α was on the cell surface (data not shown), and hence we observed much more Hsp90α recovered from the total cell lysate samples (Fig. 4). After normalizing for the amount of Hsp90α present in each of the immunoprecipitates, we found that the c"

Comparison of YR orthologs and paralogs revealed Asp6.59 to be fully conserved throughout all of the YRs reported so far. By replacing this conserved aspartic acid residue with alanine, asparagine, glutamate, and arginine, we now show that this residue plays a crucial role in binding and signal transduction of NPY/PP at all YRs. Sensitivity to distinct replacements is, however, receptor subtype-specific. Next, we performed a complementary mutagenesis approach to identify the contact site of the ligand. Surprisingly, this conserved residue interacts with two different ligand arginine residues by ionic interactions; although in Y2R and Y5R, Arg33 is the binding partner of Asp6.59, in Y1R and Y4R, Arg35 of human PP and NPY interacts with Asp6.59. Furthermore, Arg25 of PP and NPY is involved in ligand binding only at Y2R and Y5R. This suggests significant differences in the docking of YR ligands between Y1/4R and Y2/5R and provides new insights into the molecular binding mode of peptide agonists at GPCRs.

Consequently, knowledge of the mechanism of peptide-receptor interaction is of great relevance, and efforts in designing subtype-selective agonists are central.

Despite the low sequence similarity between YR subtypes, all bind the same family of peptides. All of the four most intensely investigated YR subtypes (Y1R, Y2R, Y4R, and Y5R) have their own signature profile of ligand recognition, indicating that the ligand-binding pocket displays subtype-specific differences.

However, the C-terminal pentapeptide of all natural ligands was identified as an essential region for binding to all YRs (23Beck-Sickinger A.G. Wieland H.A. Wittneben H. Willim K.D. Rudolf K. Jung G.

Interestingly, studies of analogs containing conformational constraints, when bound at the various YR subtypes, support the concept of structural differences between subtypes in this domain (25Fuhlendorff J.

Although many efforts have been made to characterize the relevance of the individual amino acids of the ligand, little is known about residues within receptor involved in ligand recognition. For the hY1R only, all extracellularly located Glu and Asp residues have been mutated to Ala to identify possible interaction partners of the Arg residues of the C-terminal pentapeptide of NPY (29Walker P. Munoz M. Martinez R. Peitsch M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2863-2869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sautel M. Rudolf K. Wittneben H. Herzog H. Martinez R. Munoz M. Eberlein W.

Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we have now identified one conserved residue Asp6.59 (see “Experimental Procedures” for position numbering scheme) and proved its importance in all YRs by replacing it with Ala, Glu, Asn, and Arg. Interestingly, the fine mapping of Asp6.59 showed differences between Y1R, Y2R, Y5R, and Y4R, suggesting a subtype-specific binding pocket. Then using a complementary mutagenesis approach to receptors and ligands, we identified the interaction partner of YR-Asp6.59 in the peptide ligands. Surprisingly, a receptor subtype-specific interaction was observed, where Asp6.59 of Y1R and Y4R interacts with Arg35 of NPY/PP, and Asp6.59 of Y2R and Y5 R contacts Arg33 of NPY, suggesting differences in the docking of YR ligands to Y2/5R and Y1/4R. Further receptor subtype-specific interactions have been identified for [Ala25]NPY/hPP and position Asp/Glu5.27 in the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of YRs. These data are of great importance not only for YRs. We suggest a binding mode that involves at least two different events and contact sides. Furthermore, we identified one position on top of transmembrane domain (TMD) 6 that might be a general activation residue in many peptide-binding GPCRs, probably representing the second step. Additionally, these results are relevant to the evolution of GPCRs, because the multi-ligand/multi-receptor system has evolved from an ancestor ligand/receptor pair. We speculate that the Arg35/Asp6.59 interaction may have evolved in the primordial YR first, and the alternate binding of the Asp6.59 arose later, after the gene duplication and evolution of Y2/Y5Rs. Peptide Synthesis—The following peptides were synthesized by automated solid phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoctert-butyl (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-tert-butyl) strategy (23Beck-Sickinger A.G.

The peptides were purified, and peptide mass was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry. To confirm the correct position of C-terminal Ala residues, bromocyan digest followed by Edman sequencing ([Ala33]hPP and [Ala35]hPP) or tryptic digest combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of the fragments ([Ala33]pNPY and [Ala35]pNPY) were performed. CD analysis of Ala substituted peptides were performed (23Beck-Sickinger A.G. Wieland H.A. Wittneben H. Willim K.D. Rudolf K. Jung G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and showed no significant differences to wild type pNPY and hPP. Position Numbering System in YRs—The residues are numbered relative to the most conserved residue contained in the helix, as explained previously (32Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). On the basis of this scheme, the most conserved residue in TMD 6 is proline, designated with the index number 6.50 and hence referred to throughout as Pro6.50. Asp, located nine residues C-terminal of Pro6.50, is referred to Asp6.59 to compare conserved residues in different receptors. Generation of Mutant YRs—The subcloning of the human Y2R and Y5R cDNA into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) has been described previously (33Dinger M.C.

Mutations were introduced with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, CA). For receptor quantification in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies (see below) an N-terminal nine-amino acid residue epitope (YPYDVPDYA) derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein tag was inserted downstream of the start codon of all YRs. Enhanced green fluorescent protein was fused to the human Y2R and Y5R, and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) was fused to the human Y1R and Y4R cDNA for fluorescence detection. As previously shown the function of YRs is not altered by C-terminal fusion to fluorescent proteins (33Dinger M.C. Bader J.E. Kobor A.D. Kretzschmar A.K. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10562-10571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The correctness of all of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing of the entire coding region. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Functional Assays—Baby hamster kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown as monolayers at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Radioligand binding studies were performed with [3H]propionylated pNPY ([3H]pNPY; 107 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and [3H]propionylated hPP ([3H]hPP) on transiently transfected cells as described previously (34Hofliger M.M.

Chem. 2003; 46: 4369-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (for details see supplemental materials). Signal transduction was studied by co-transfection of COS-7 cells with YRs and chimeric G proteins (Gαqi4, GαΔ6qi4myr kindly provided by E. Kostenis) and subsequent measuring of the signal of the phospholipase Cβ-pathway (inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation) as described (36Berridge M.J. Biochem.

J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that replacement of the four or five C-terminal amino acids of Gαq with the corresponding Gαi residues (referred to as Gαqi4) confers the ability to stimulate the phospholipase Cβ pathway onto Gi-coupled receptors (38Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 39Kostenis E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 560-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For control, transfection of chimeric G proteins without receptor and only transfection of the receptor and subsequent stimulation experiments were performed and did not show any increased IP accumulation up to 100 μm of the ligand (for details and controls see supplemental Fig. S1). Immunological and Immunofluorescence Studies—To ligand-independently estimate plasma membrane localization, a cell surface ELISA was performed with wild type and mutant receptors carrying an N-terminal hemagglutinin tag (40Schoneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (for details see supplemental materials). Immunofluorescence studies were carried out to determine the subcellular distribution of wild type and mutant receptors. COS-7 cells were transferred into 24-well plates that contained sterilized glass coverslips and transfected. Approximately 48 h later, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde. The cells were treated with an anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (10 μg of 12CA5/ml) and then incubated with a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-linked antimouse IgG secondary antibody. Fluorescence images were obtained with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2; Heidelberg, Germany). Identification of Conserved Residues in the Third Extracellular Loop—By comparing the amino acid sequences of ECL3 of human, rat, and mouse YRs (Fig. 1) and further available sequences, the conservation of residue Asp6.59 became obvious for YRs, whereas Asp/Glu is not found in any other peptide-binding GPCRs except for the receptors of the neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and pyroglutamylated Arg-Phe-amide peptide (QRFP) family. The general receptor numbering system (32Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2481) Google Scholar) was used to compare residue positions between receptors. The first digit indicates the transmembrane domain, and the last two digits are selected such that the most conserved residue in each helix has the number 50, e.g. proline in TMD 6 is referred to Pro6.50 (Fig. 1). It became obvious that in many peptide-binding GPCRs of class A, position 6.59 (± one position) is a conserved trifunctional amino acid that qualifies for ligand binding. This includes receptors for orexin (Lys6.58/Lys6.59), bradykinin (Asp6.58), cholestocytokinin, (Arg6.58/Ala6.59), endothelin (Lys6.58/Lys6.59), and angiotensin (Asp6.58/Val6.59). Asp6.59 Is a Functional Key Residue in All YRs—To study whether this conserved aspartate plays an important role in ligand binding, Asp6.59 was substituted with Ala in Y1R, Y2R, Y4R, and Y5R, and wild type and mutant receptors were transiently expressed and functionally tested. As shown in Table 1, mutation of Asp6.59 to Ala resulted in a dramatic loss of affinity, and the Kd values could no longer be determined because specific binding was only 2-4% of wild type binding. To further characterize the mutant receptors, IP accumulation assays with chimeric G proteins were performed. IP formation revealed a more than 600-fold reduction in pNPY potency for Y2R-D6.59A, a 12-fold reduction for Y4R-D6.59A, and a 99-fold reduction for Y5R-D6.59A compared with a 461-fold reduction for Y1R-D6.59A (Table 1). In contrast, mutagenesis of nearby Asp residues in Y2R and Y5R to yield Y2 R-D6.61 A and Y5 R-D6.62 A showed wild type properties in both binding and signal transduction (Table 1). ELISA and confocal microscopy studies demonstrated that cell surface expression levels of these and the following Asp6.59 mutants were not significantly different when compared with the wild type receptors (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2). This implies that Asp6.59 is a functional key residue in all YRs.TABLE 1Functional characterization of wild type and mutant Y receptorsConstructRadioligand binding (Kd)aKd values were determined in saturation experiments using [3H]pNPY for Y1R, Y2R, Y5R and [3H]hPP for Y4R.IP assaybEmax and EC50 values were obtained from concentration-response curves.

https://openalex.org/W2106698196,"Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in fat and muscle by redistributing GLUT4 glucose transporters from intracellular membranes to the cell surface. We previously proposed that, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TUG retains GLUT4 within unstimulated cells and insulin mobilizes this retained GLUT4 by stimulating its dissociation from TUG. Yet the relative importance of this action in the overall control of glucose uptake remains uncertain. Here we report that transient, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of TUG causes GLUT4 translocation and enhances glucose uptake in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, similar to insulin. Stable TUG depletion or expression of a dominant negative fragment likewise stimulates GLUT4 redistribution and glucose uptake, and insulin causes a 2-fold further increase. Microscopy shows that TUG governs the accumulation of GLUT4 in perinuclear membranes distinct from endosomes and indicates that it is this pool of GLUT4 that is mobilized by TUG disruption. Interestingly, in addition to translocating GLUT4 and enhancing glucose uptake, TUG disruption appears to accelerate the degradation of GLUT4 in lysosomes. Finally, we find that TUG binds directly and specifically to a large intracellular loop in GLUT4. Together, these findings demonstrate that TUG is required to retain GLUT4 intracellularly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the absence of insulin and further implicate the insulin-stimulated dissociation of TUG and GLUT4 as an important action by which insulin stimulates glucose uptake.

Rev. 2004; 25: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, GLUT4 is retained in intracellular membranes, and its predominant exclusion from the plasma membrane minimizes glucose uptake from the extracellular space. Within minutes of insulin stimulation, GLUT4 is translocated so that the number of transporters in the plasma membrane is increased and glucose uptake is accelerated. This insulin action is defective in muscle and adipose from individuals with type 2 diabetes and other insulin-resistant states (3Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar, 4Abel E.D. Shepherd P.R. Kahn B.B. Le Roith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M.

Metab. 2001; 86: 5450-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms governing GLUT4 distribution and its regulation by insulin remain poorly characterized. To redistribute GLUT4, insulin acts primarily on the exocytic arm of the GLUT4 recycling pathway. The signaling proteins involved include Akt/protein kinase B and its substrate AS160; the latter protein was recently shown also to contribute to intracellular retention of GLUT4 in unstimulated cells (6Larance M. Ramm G. Stockli J. van Dam E.M. Winata S. Wasinger V. Simpson F. Graham M. Junutula J.R. Guilhaus M. James D.E. J. Biol.

Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Studies of GLUT4 vesicle traffic have been complicated by the fact that unstimulated cells, particularly the widely used 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line, contain multiple pools of intracellular GLUT4. These include GLUT4 in endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and poorly characterized membranes sometimes termed as the “insulin-responsive compartment” or “GLUT4 storage vesicles” (GSVs). Insulin stimulates endosome recycling, which may contribute a 2-fold increase in cell surface GLUT4 and other proteins such as the transferrin receptor (TfnR). The more dramatic, insulin-stimulated increase in cell surface GLUT4, and not in other recycling proteins, is due to mobilization of GSVs. These membranes comprise small, preformed vesicles that are depleted of TfnR and other endosomal markers (8Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Xu Z. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47972-47975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Data indicate that GSVs are derived by budding from the trans-Golgi network, yet they may also exchange with endosomes (10Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S.

Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, GSVs are distinct from secretory vesicles containing adiponectin (13Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of these vesicles is both cell type-specific and developmentally regulated (14Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). How GSVs are retained intracellularly in the absence of insulin, and how these GLUT4-containing membranes are mobilized by insulin stimulation, remains uncertain. We recently proposed that in unstimulated cells, GLUT4 that is present in GSVs may be tethered to intracellular structures to restrict its movement to the plasma membrane (15Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Nature. 2003; 425: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). According to this model, insulin “untethers” this GLUT4 to accelerate its movement to the cell surface and subsequent fusion at the plasma membrane. We identified TUG as a putative tethering protein, which acts in concert with other proteins to retain GLUT4 within cells in the absence of insulin. Supporting this model, TUG and GLUT4 form a complex in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and colocalize on TfnR-negative intracellular membranes that sediment as light microsomes (15Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Nature. 2003; 425: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These are properties shared by GSVs. The TUG-GLUT4 complex is insulin-responsive, because insulin acts rapidly to stimulate the dissociation of TUG and GLUT4 (15Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Nature. 2003; 425: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Overexpression of TUG both increases the size of the insulin-responsive GLUT4 pool, assessed using kinetics, and increases the number of insulin-responsive TUG-GLUT4 protein complexes (15Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Nature. 2003; 425: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of a dominant negative TUG UBX-Cter fragment decreases the size of the insulin-responsive pool and decreases the number of TUG-GLUT4 complexes. Together, these data suggested that TUG is part of an insulin-responsive mechanism governing the sequestration of GLUT4 in GSVs within unstimulated 3T3-L1 cells. Here we use RNAi-mediated depletion of TUG to further characterize its role in GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These data show that TUG is required for intracellular retention of GLUT4 in nonendosomal, perinuclear membranes within unstimulated cells, consistent with the model described above. The magnitude of the effects we observe suggests that the TUG-GLUT4 complex may be an important site of insulin action to regulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Cell Lines and Reagents—3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured as described previously, except that the fully supplemented, initial differentiation medium was used for 72 h, and differentiation medium containing insulin alone was omitted (13Bogan J.S.

In some experiments siPORT electroporation buffer (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) was used. 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing a GLUT4-7Myc-GFP reporter protein, with or without the TUG UBX-Cter fragment or overexpressed TUG protein, have been described previously (13Bogan J.S.

(Berkeley, CA), anti-β-actin antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), anti-transferrin receptor antibody from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and anti-Hsc70 antibody from Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (13Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Pellets previously termed “LDM” and “HDM” are here more accurately called light microsomes (LMs) and heavy microsomes (HMs). Pellets were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), as described (13Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Total protein concentrations were measured in triplicate using micro-BCA (Pierce) or EZQ protein quantitation kits (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Victor3 plate reader. For SDS-PAGE, equal protein amounts were loaded in each well, and Invitrogen Novex NuPAGE gels and buffers were used. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry apparatus, and immunoblotting was performed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection on film as described previously (13Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For densitometry, film exposures in the linear range were scanned using transillumination at 16-bit pixel depth, and quantification was done using ImageJ. Statistical significance was assessed using a paired, two-tailed Student's t test. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—Assays were done as described, except that 12- or 6-well plates were used and mannitol was omitted (15Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Nature. 2003; 425: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were differentiated (for stable cell lines) or reseeded (for cells electroporated with siRNA duplexes) in multiwell plates. Electroporated cells were assayed 2 days after siRNA transfection. Cells were starved, washed, then stimulated using 80 or 160 nm insulin for 20 min at 37 °C. 1 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[2,6-3H]glucose was added so that the final concentration of 2-deoxyglucose was 50 mm, and uptake was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 6 min or at 25 °C for 8 min. Cells were washed using cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. A portion of each lysate was used for a BCA protein assay (Pierce), so that total protein could be used to correct for variation in the number of cells in each well. Nonspecific uptake was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B and was subtracted from 3H counts obtained from other wells. Data points were obtained in triplicate or quadruplicate, and statistical significance was assessed using a paired, two-tailed Student's t test. Recombinant Proteins and Binding Experiments—Plasmids containing the large intracellular loop of rat GLUT4 (residues 223-288) or GLUT1 (residues 207-271) in a modified pGEX-2T vector were a kind gift of Drs. Amira Klip and Philip Bilan. These proteins and control GST protein were expressed in the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain or its derivative, Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Expression was induced using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, then cells were pelleted and lysed in ice-cold NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were purified from the soluble phase using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). To use equal amounts of GST or GST fusion proteins in binding experiments, aliquots of the beads were removed and the amount of protein bound was assessed by elution in sample buffer, SDS-PAGE, and Gelcode Coomassie staining (Pierce). Recombinant, full-length TUG protein was subcloned in the pTYB3 vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and produced using the Roche Applied Science RTS system according to the manufacturer's instructions. TUG fragments containing residues 1-164 or 165-550 were produced and labeled with [35S]methionine using a TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Intact or truncated TUG proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with bound GST, GST-GLUT4loop, or GST-GLUT1loop in NETN buffer. The following day, the beads were washed four times with NETN buffer, and proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (for intact TUG) or autoradiography (for the 35S-labeled fragments). Duplicate gels were stained with Gelcode Coomassie to demonstrate equivalent loading of GST or GST-loop proteins. Confocal Microscopy—3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing a GLUT4 reporter were reseeded on coverslips, starved, stimulated, and prepared for imaging as previously described (13Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F.

To detect externalized Myc epitope tag, staining with 9E10 monoclonal antibody was done on live cells at 4 °C prior to fixation. For intracellular antigens (e.g. TfnR), cells were fixed and permeabilized before staining for indirect immunofluorescence. Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used for simultaneous detection with GFP. Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope using a 63×/1.20 water immersion objective and pinhole settings for an Airy unit of 1.0. Images were acquired at 12-bit pixel depth with a scan head speed of 6, and signal averaging of 8 or 16 total acquisitions. Postprocessing was done at 12-bit pixel depth and linear gamma using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Cells were disrupted in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA from each sample was treated with DNase I and reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II with random hexamer priming (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed for all samples using self-designed primer combinations (Primer Express Software 2.0, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primer pairs used included those to detect murine TUG (5′-CCTGACCCTGTATCCCTGGA-3′ and 5′-TCAGCCACTTGGGTACTTTGC-3′), murine GLUT4 (5′-CCAACAGCTCTCAGGCATCA-3′ and 5′-TGACCACACCAGCTCCTATGG-3′), GLUT4 reporter (5′-TGCTTGGCTCCCTTCAGTTT-3′ and 5′-CCTGCCTACCCAGCCAAGT-3′), GFP (5′-CAGGAGCGCACCATCTTCTT-3′ and 5′-CGATGCCCTTCAGCTCGAT-3′), and both native GLUT4 and exogenous GLUT4 reporter (5′-GAGGCCGGACGTTTGAC-3′ and 5′-CTGGGTTTCACCTCCTGCTCTA-3′). Detection was with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), and all samples were normalized to 18 S 5-carboxyfluorescein-labeled endogenous control (Applied Biosystems). For each individual sample, expression of specific mRNAs was quantified in duplicate with a tolerated variance of ∼10% in an iQ5 Cycler (Bio-Rad). Samples were analyzed in triplicate. Other Methods—To assess the effect of lysosomal inhibition on GLUT4 protein amounts, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle media containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum with or without 0.4 mm chloroquine (Sigma), essentially as described (14Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for various amounts of time, and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The protein concentration of each sample was measured as described above, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To evaluate the role of TUG in the control of glucose uptake, we transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes with synthetic siRNA duplexes. Fig. 1a demonstrates that two different siRNA duplexes effectively deplete TUG protein. In control, mock transfected cells, and in those transfected with irrelevant siRNA duplexes, there was no effect on TUG protein amount. In contrast, the two siRNAs that target TUG each depleted the protein by ∼85%, assessed 48 h after transfection. Amounts of insulin receptor β chain were unaffected. Thus, the two different siRNAs effectively and specifically depleted TUG protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The effect of siRNA-mediated TUG depletion on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is shown in Fig. 1b. In control mock or luciferase siRNA-transfected cells, insulin stimulated a ∼4-fold increase in glucose uptake. In cells transfected with either of the two TUG siRNAs, basal glucose uptake was markedly increased, and no further increase was observed after insulin stimulation. In several experiments, siRNA duplex B was the slightly more effective of the two duplexes, and it may have enhanced glucose uptake more than siRNA duplex A, although this did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that transient depletion of TUG markedly augments glucose uptake, similar to insulin, in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To determine if the enhanced glucose uptake we observed after TUG siRNA transfection is attributable to increased GLUT4 or GLUT1 protein amounts, these proteins were assayed on immunoblots of total cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1c, neither GLUT4 nor GLUT1 was increased in 3T3-L1 adipocytes transfected with TUG siRNA B, compared with mock transfected control cells. Indeed, GLUT4 was actually decreased, raising the possibility that TUG may coordinately regulate GLUT4 targeting and protein levels, as discussed further below. No consistent effects on GLUT1 protein amount were noted. Thus, the enhanced glucose uptake we observed could not be attributed to increased GLUT4 or GLUT1 protein amounts. These data are consistent with the possibility that TUG depletion caused GLUT4 targeting to the plasma membrane to enhance glucose uptake in cells not treated with insulin. To further study the effect of siRNA-mediated TUG depletion on GLUT4 subcellular localization, we performed confocal microscopy of 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably expressing a GFP- and Myc-tagged GLUT4 reporter (13Bogan J.S. McKee A.E. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4785-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, cells were transfected using a control siRNA and not treated with insulin targeted GLUT4 to intracellular membranes, and the typical perinuclear distribution was observed (top row). Minimal surface-exposed Myc epitope tag was detected in these unstimulated cells. After insulin exposure, GLUT4 was seen in both perinuclear and plasma membrane distributions, and detection of externalized Myc epitope tag demonstrated that GLUT4 had been incorporated into the plasma membrane (second row). In cells in which TUG was depleted by transfection of siRNA B, GLUT4 was observed at the cell surface even in the absence of insulin (third row). Externalized Myc epitope was abundant, showing that this GLUT4 had been incorporated into the plasma membrane. The surface GLUT4 may be more punctate than in the insulin-treated control cells, which have a more homogeneous pattern, yet the overall pattern was clearly distinct from that in unstimulated control cells. After insulin stimulation of the TUG siRNA-treated cells, GLUT4 was again observed at the cell surface (bottom row). Externalized Myc tag was readily detected, and again demonstrated a punctate distribution. Thus, the main result was that transient, siRNA-mediated TUG depletion caused marked incorporation of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To perform more detailed analyses, we constructed 3T3-L1 cells in which TUG was stably depleted by retroviral expression of a shRNA. This shRNA targets the same sequence as TUG siRNA duplex B, described above. We isolated a homogeneous population of infected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by flow cytometry. These “shRNA” cells undergo normal adipose differentiation, as judged by lipid accumulation and expression of GLUT4, compared with control, uninfected 3T3-L1 cells. Fig. 3a demonstrates that TUG was depleted by >95% in adipocytes containing the shRNA. To further control for the specificity of TUG depletion, the shRNA cells were superinfected with a retrovirus containing a shRNA-resistant form of TUG, to make “shRNA + TUG” cells. These cells were also isolated by flow sorting and underwent normal adipose conversion. Fig. 2a shows that the reintroduced TUG protein was present in amounts that were ∼5-fold higher than that of endogenous TUG in control, uninfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As well, amounts of GLUT4 were similar or slightly decreased in shRNA cells, and markedly increased in shRNA+TUG cells, suggesting that GLUT4 abundance may be regulated by TUG protein levels. No large effect on GLUT1 protein amounts was observed. Thus, data from both stable and transiently transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes suggest that TUG abundance may positively regulate GLUT4 protein amount, as examined further below. We first tested the effect of stable TUG depletion on glucose uptake. Fig. 3b shows that unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes containing the shRNA had increased glucose uptake compared with control cells. This increased basal glucose uptake was nearly equal to that caused by insulin treatment of the control cells. Insulin further enhanced glucose uptake in cells depleted of TUG, but only by ∼2-fold because of the increased basal uptake. The enhanced glucose uptake in the shRNA cells was not attributable to increased GLUT1 or GLUT4 protein amounts, which were similar or slightly decreased in shRNA cells compared with control cells, as noted above (Fig. 3a). Reintroduction of shRNA-resistant TUG rescued the effect on glucose uptake, indicating that it resulted from TUG depletion and was not a nonspecific effect of the shRNA. Remarkably, glucose uptake in shRNA+TUG cells was similar to that in control cells even despite the markedly increased GLUT4 abundance in shRNA+TUG cells (Fig. 3a). This may reflect the ability of overexpressed TUG to retain GLUT4 within cells, sequestering it away from the plasma membrane (Fig. 4a) (15Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Nature. 2003; 425: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Finally, it was notable that the variability in glucose uptake measurements was much smaller in stable cells (Fig. 3b) than in electroporated cells (Fig. 1b), permitting the observation of a significant effect of insulin to enhance glucose uptake in the shRNA cells. Thus, both stable and transient depletion of TUG resulted in increased glucose uptake in unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and in neither case was this attributable to increased amounts of GLUT4 or GLUT1 proteins. To study the effect of the TUG shRNA on glucose transporter distribution, we performed subcellular fractionation of basal and insulin-stimulated control, shRNA, and shRNA + TUG 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 4a, insulin increased GLUT4 in plasma membranes of control cells, and there was a corresponding decrease of GLUT4 in light microsomes (top left panel). In shRNA cells, GLUT4 was abundant in plasma membranes, and was relatively decreased in light microsomes, both in basal and insulin-treated cells (middle left panel). Some GLUT4 remained in basal light microsomes and was decreased by insulin, but this effect was less marked than in control cells and may have been due to endosome recycling. In the shRNA + TUG cells, reintroduction of TUG rescued both basal GLUT4 retention in light microsomes and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 movement to the plasma membrane (bottom left panel). Therefore, these effects were due to TUG depletion and not nonspecific effects of the shRNA. As predicted by data in Fig. 3, GLUT4 was very well excluded from plasma membranes of basal shRNA + TUG cells. Immunoblotting of the fractions to detect GLUT1 demonstrated that, in control cells, insulin caused some movement of GLUT1 out of light microsomes a"

Magnetic resonance molecular imaging is an imaging technique that allows the visualization of pathological processes in vivo with a better spatial resolution as compared with nuclear methods, such as photon emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography. In this study, we used alpha(v)beta3 targeted bimodal liposomes to quantitate angiogenesis in a tumor mouse model with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the angiogenesis inhibitors anginex and endostatin. The MRI findings were validated with fluorescence microscopy and showed a very good correlation with the microvessel density. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that molecular MRI can be used to noninvasively measure the efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors during the course of therapy."

There are four members of mammalian TIMPs (TIMP-1, -2, -3, -4) and each TIMP has its own specific profile of inhibition against the metalloproteinases (MPs). TIMP-1, for instance, inhibits the majority of the MMPs with the exception of MMP-19 and the membrane-type MT-MMPs (1Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As well as this, TIMP-1 is also a known inhibitor of ADAM-10 but its activity against ADAM-17 (TNF-α-converting enzyme, TACE) has been shown to be minimal (4Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelly C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 5Amour A. Knight C.G.

TIMP-3, on the contrary, inhibits all known interstitial and membrane-bound MMPs as well as several key ADAMs and ADAMTSs, the most notable being ADAM-10, ADAM-17, and the aggrecanases ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 (6Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12501-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Collectively, TIMPs regulate the enzymatic activities of all MMPs and many of the known ADAM and ADAMTS proteinases. TIMPs are relatively small proteins of ca. 21-28-kDa molecular mass. They exert their inhibitory functions on the MPs by forming 1:1 non-covalent stoichiometric complexes with the catalytic domains of the enzyme targets (7Gomis-Rüth F. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A.

Freedman R.B. Carr M.D. Williamson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21736-21743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The four TIMPs share a relatively high degree (40-50%) of sequence homology (9Douglas D.A. Shi Y.E. Sang Q.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but to date, only the structures of TIMP-1 and -2 have been resolved by protein crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (PDB 1UEA and PDB 1BR2) (7Gomis-Rüth F.

The overall conformation of the two TIMPs is remarkably comparable: both are multidomain proteins with very similar, near-super-imposable N- and C-terminal configurations. The N-terminal domain of the TIMPs encompasses the first two-thirds of the polypeptides. Structurally, the domain resembles a five anti-parallel β-stranded barrel typical of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding (OB) moiety. The C-terminal subdomain is made up of the remaining 50-60 amino acids, and its structure is generally less well defined. There are six disulfide bonds in the TIMPs, three within each domain. Although the structures of TIMP-3 and -4 are yet to be determined, mutagenesis and kinetic studies carried out on the two TIMPs suggest an overall similarity in tertiary configuration with those of TIMP-1 and -2 (11Lee M.H. Verma V. Maskos K. Nath D. Knäuper V. Dodds P. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15967-15975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TIMP-3 is unique, because it is the sole TIMP regulator of one of the most versatile ADAM sheddases, TACE (ADAM-17) (4Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelly C. Hutton M. Knäuper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TIMP-3 is also renowned for its ability to induce apoptosis in mammalian cells by stabilization of the three death receptors TNF-RI, FAS, and TRAIL-RI (13Ahonen M. Baker A.H. Kahari V.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 11: 2310-2315Google Scholar, 14Ahonen M. Poukkula M. Baker A.H. Kashiwagi M. Nagase H. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2121-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Another extraordinary quality that distinguishes TIMP-3 from the others is its ability to adhere to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Whereas TIMP-1, -2, and -4 are all soluble proteins, TIMP-3 is largely sequestered to the ECM in both its glycosylated (27 kDa) and unglycosylated (24 kDa) forms. Indeed, TIMP-3 was first discovered as a novel ECM-adhering molecule from chicken embryo fibroblasts undergoing early stages of oncogenic transformation (15Blenis J. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11563-11570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, there has been no systematic research to investigate whether this ECM-adhering attribute has any bearing upon the biological activities of the inhibitor. We are interested in the development of TIMP-3 to counter TACE-related inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease (16Lorenz H.M. Kalden J.R. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17van Deventer S.J.H. Gut. 2002; 51: 5-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To succeed in making a therapeutic TIMP of high specificity, it will be essential to understand the molecular rationale that underpins TIMP-3:ECM association to formulate an effective strategy of delivery. At present, there is no consensus among researchers as to the exact location of the ECM binding motif in TIMP-3. On the one hand, it appears that the C-terminal domain is critical for ECM-association since N-TIMP-3 (TIMP-3 devoid of a C-terminal domain) displays no propensity for ECM association while T2:T3 chimera (i.e. N-TIMP-2 fused with C-TIMP-3) is capable of adhering to the ECM, albeit with lesser affinity (18Langton K.P.

On the other hand, N-TIMP-3 has also been shown to bind to heparin with affinity similar to that of full-length TIMP-3, suggesting that the binding motif is situated at the N-terminal domain (19Yu W.S. Yu S.C. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31226-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To clarify the confusion, we embarked on a series of site-directed and domain-exchanged mutagenesis leading to the final uncovering of the ECM binding motif. In this report, we examined earlier findings by Langton et al. (18Langton K.P. Barker M.D. McKie N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16778-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and showed that both the N and C termini of TIMP-3 were implicated in ECM association. To find out the residues involved, a strategy was devised to split the molecule into two independent entities to simplify the process of identification. This brought about successful delineation of the ECM binding modules on the N- and C-terminal domains and a soluble TIMP-3 devoid of ECM binding ability. The final part of the results demonstrates how our understanding of the motif has been adapted to engineer a TIMP-1 variant equally capable of ECM association. Materials—All chemicals and reagents in this study were purchased from Sigma Chemicals unless otherwise stated. Vent and Kod DNA polymerases for mutagenesis were purchased from New England Biolabs and Merck Biosciences, respectively. All restriction enzymes for subcloning are also from New England Biolabs. DNA primers for mutagenesis were synthesized by MWG-Biotech AG. Anti-human TIMP-3 monoclonal antibody, 136-13H4, was a kind gift from Daiichi Chemical Industries Ltd, Takaoka, Japan. Construction of TIMP Chimeras and Site-directed Mutagenesis of TIMP-3—All TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4 cDNAs used in this study are of human origin. TIMP chimeras (TX:TX) were typically produced in two stages. The first stage of the mutagenesis process involved independent amplification of the N- and the C-terminal domains of the desired TIMPs by PCR before ligation to create an uncorrected TX:TX template in pcDNA 3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). To make the interdomain ligation possible, an NdeI restriction site was incorporated into the 3′- and 5′-ends of the PCR fragments encoding the two domains. The second stage of the process entailed elimination and replacement of the NdeI site by a pair of primers encoding the correct amino acid sequence. This was achieved by QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) following the recommended protocols. Mutants of simpler designs were constructed by direct amplification of the cDNAs with long distance Kod DNA polymerase. All constructs in this study have been sequenced to confirm that no unwanted mutations had been introduced during the mutagenesis process. Transient TIMP Transfection—A total of four adherent cell lines were used in this study: immortalized HeLa cells, MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, and transformed African green monkey kidney fibroblast COS-7 cells. The procedure for transfection is a slight modification of the protocol recommended in the product leaf-let accompanying the FuGene® 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). As a general rule, the cells were typically seeded to 30-40% confluency the day before transfection in 6-well tissue culture plates in 1.5 ml 10% fetal calf serum-enriched Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium-Glutamax® media (Invitrogen). 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used for transfection throughout this work. Plasmid DNA was added to 3 μl of FuGene premixed with 97 μl serum-free media for 20 min before dropwise addition to the cells. 24 h post-transfection, the media were replaced by fresh DMEM-Glutamax® but with reduced fetal calf serum (2.5%) content. Incubation was allowed for a further 3 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator before the ECM, media, or cell lysates were harvested for analysis. ECM Harvesting—Confluent cell layers were detached from the culture plates by preincubation in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4 at 37 °C for 1 h. Cell layers were lifted off the plates by twice gentle washing of the dishes using PBS with added EGTA/EDTA (5 mm each). The cell pellets were stored at -20 °C until required for Western blot analysis. The plates were rinsed for the final time with PBS and examined under a low power microscope to ensure that no cell debris remained on the dishes. Whole ECM was harvested into 100 μl of non-reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer (2.4 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 3 ml of 20% SDS, 3 ml of glycerol, and 6 mg of bromphenol blue made up to 10 ml with sterile water) with the help of cell scrapers. Samples were stored at -20 °C until required. We typically used up to 5 μl of ECM samples and 4 μl of conditioned media for reverse zymography analysis. Reverse Zymography—Reverse zymography was performed in 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel containing 0.5 mg/ml gelatin and 0.33 ml/5 ml BHK-conditioned media expressing gelatinase-A enzyme (20Janowska-Wieczorek A. Marquez L.A. Matsuzaki A. Hashmi H.R. Larratt L.M. Boshkov L.M. Turner A.R. Zhang M.C. Edwards D.R. Brit. J. Haematology. 1999; 105: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were washed twice, 30 min each, first with 2.5% Triton X-100 in water and the second time with 2.5% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Gels were briefly rinsed with water before overnight incubation at 37 °C in 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The following day, gels were stained for 30 min in 0.25% Coomassie Blue G-250 followed by destaining in a solution containing 30% methanol and 1% acetic acid. The presence of TIMPs was identified as dark bands on a light background. Western Blotting—Protein contents from the whole cell lysates (from cell pellets dissolved in 200 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer; 8 μl used in each lane), ECM (10 μl), and conditioned media (6 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE electro-phoresis before transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Following incubation in anti-TIMP-3 antibody (8 μg/ml) for 1 h, the membrane was briefly washed in PBS and probed with sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson IR Laboratories) for another hour. TIMP-3 was detected with ECL® Western blotting Reagent (Amersham Biosciences) by 30 s to 1 min exposure to film. Scanning TIMP-3 for ECM Binding Motif: Unsuccessful Attempts to Create a Soluble TIMP-3—The ECM binding profiles of wild-type human TIMPs (TIMP-1 to -4) using a HeLa cell expression mode are shown in Fig. 1A (left panel). Among the four TIMPs, only TIMP-3 was sequestered to the ECM, whereas TIMP-1, -2, and -4 were all highly water soluble. Two forms of TIMP-3 were detected in the ECM: an unglycosylated form (24 kDa) and a glycosylated form (27 kDa) (Fig. 1A, upper panel, highlighted by arrows). Although both forms of TIMP-3 were ECM-sequestered, there were some recombinant proteins in the conditioned media possibly because of leakage from an oversaturated ECM. At the outset of this study, we repeated the same experiments by Langton et al. (18Langton K.P. Barker M.D. McKie N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16778-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) but with a C-terminally tagged version of TIMP-3 included. The C-terminal hexa-histidine tag was added because we intend to purify TIMP-3 in the near future and hence the interest in knowing its effects on the ECM binding characteristic of the molecule. The solubility and ECM binding profiles of untagged TIMP-3, histidine-tagged TIMP-3 and N-TIMP-3 in transiently transfected HeLa cells are shown in the right panel of Fig. 1A. Indeed, both wild-type TIMP-3 (24 kDa) and its histidine-tagged variant (25 kDa) were clearly ECM-associated. N-TIMP-3, in contrast, was exclusively water-soluble, and no trace of the protein could be discerned in the ECM. The conclusion appeared straightforward: the ECM binding motif of TIMP-3 must reside within the C-terminal domain as N-TIMP-3 was totally incapable of adhering to the ECM. To find out if the primary sequence of TIMP-3 contains any recognized heparin binding motifs, we BLAST-searched TIMP-3 with proteins in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) but failed to retrieve any significant hits with known heparin binding sequences (such as the “XBBXBX” and “XBBBXXBX” motifs whereby “B” denotes basic residues and “X” represents other amino acids) (21Cardin A.D. Demeter D.A. Weintraub H.J. Jackson R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 203: 556-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Neither can a canonical integrin binding motif (e.g. RGD motif) be detected from homology comparison (Fig. 1B). Undefined exploration, on the other hand, would certainly entail mutations of a very large repertoire of residues with no guarantee of success. Because of the apparent lack of an identifiable motif, we used molecular modeling to find alternative explanations. Fig. 1C is a model of TIMP-3 created on the backbones of TIMP-1 and -2. Eleven lysine and arginine residues are highlighted in the figure, six on the N-terminal domain (Lys-26, Lys-27, Lys-30, Lys-71, Lys-76, and Arg-100) and five on the C-terminal domain (Lys-123, Lys-125, Lys-137, Arg-163, and Lys-165). These residues were singled out because they are all basic, non-conserved, in close proximity to each other and most importantly, their side chains are exposed to the surface in considerable high density, suggesting a possible role in heparin association. With this rationale, we proceeded to try to identify an ECM binding motif located on the C-terminal domain of TIMP-3. The outcomes of the study are shown in Fig. 2. As explained previously, five surface-exposed basic residues were deemed appropriate for alanine scanning mutagenesis on C-TIMP-3: Lys-123, Lys-125, Lys-137, Arg-163, and Lys-165. Fifteen single, double, triple, and multiple lysine/arginine-to-alanine mutants were created in the study. With the exception of three compounded mutants that were not detectable by reverse zymography (i.e. K123/125/163A, K123/125/163/165A and K123/125/137/163/165A), all the rest were still clearly ECM-sequestered. None of the mutants was exclusively soluble as had been hoped. If TIMP-3 could not be rendered soluble by such extensive mutations at the C-terminal domain, we next wondered if the goal could be achieved by mutation of the N-terminal domain. Given the strength of the affinity of N-TIMP-3 for heparin in vitro, it is possible that the motif for ECM association is indeed located on the N-terminal domain as suggested by Yu et al. (19Yu W.S. Yu S.C. Meng Q. Brew K. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31226-31232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A series of N-terminal mutants were created to examine this possibility. Of the basic residues on N-TIMP-3, six were of particular interest: Lys-26, Lys-27, Lys-30, Lys-71, Lys-76, and Arg-100 (K26, K27, K30, K71, K76, and R100; Fig. 1B, C). Instead of mutating these residues individually and collectively to generate a large pool of single and multiple mutants, a different approach was taken. Centering on Lys-26, we systematically increased the number of residues incorporated in our mutation targets until all six lysines/arginine were included in the final mutant. In line with this new strategy, only six lysine/arginine-to-glutamate (K/R to E) mutants were made, each carrying an extra mutation than its predecessor: (i) K26E (ii) K26/30E (iii) K26/27/76E (iv) K26/27/30/76E (v) K26/27/30/76E + K71E, and lastly (vi) K26/27/30/76E + R100E. As shown in Fig. 3A, mutants carrying K71E and R100E mutations were noticeably absent in the ECM and conditioned media of HeLa cells transfected with the cDNAs (hence the mutations are highlighted in bold). Subsequent Western blotting on the +K71E mutant with an anti-TIMP-3 antibody confirmed the absence of these mutants because of incorrect post-translational processing (Fig. 3B). Probably as a result of the increased negativity in surface polarity, mutant K26/27/76E and K26/27/30/76E migrated somewhat faster than their wild-type counterpart. Under reducing conditions, the pace of migration was restored to that of the wild-type TIMP-3, as confirmed by the Western blot of the K26/27/30/76E mutant in Fig. 3B. Despite the arguable increased solubility of the triple and quadruple mutants K26/27/76E and K26/27/30/76E, all the TIMP-3s demonstrated the property of ECM association. Splitting of the TIMPs: Creation of T3:TX and TX:T3 Chimeras—The unsuccessful attempt to produce a soluble TIMP-3 after exhaustive mutations at its N- and C-terminal domains necessitated a re-evaluation of our previous investigation strategy. Using a different approach, we separated the N- and C-domains into two independent entities in the expectation that this would simplify the identification process. TIMP-1, -2, and -4 are all highly water soluble. By fusing the N- and C-terminal domains of TIMP-3 to these soluble TIMPs independently, we could effectively narrow down the ECM binding motif to a specific part of the molecule. To investigate the possible roles of the N-terminal domain, fusion proteins were therefore made between N-TIMP-3 and the C-terminal domains of TIMP-1, -2, and -4. The new series of TIMP chimeras are henceforth named T3:T1, T3:T2, and T3:T4, respectively (or T3:TX in abbreviation). To study the effect of the C-terminal domain, likewise, C-TIMP-3 was made to fuse with the N-terminal domains of TIMP-1, -2, and -4 to create T1:T3, T2:T3, and T4:T3 chimeras (TX:T3 in short). In total, six chimeras were made (three T3:TX and three TX:T3) and transfected into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, all the T3:TX chimeras were partially sequestered to the ECM regardless of the nature of their C-terminal domains. Furthermore, it appears that T3:T1 and T3:T4 chimeras were produced in two different forms of slightly varied molecular mass (highlighted by an asterisk in Fig. 4A). The conclusion from the T3:TX panel was unambiguous: the ECM binding motif must be found on the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 as all T3:TX were capable of ECM association. However, when the C-TIMP-3 chimeras T1:T3 and T2:T3 were subjected to similar analysis, both chimeras also exhibited clear, though weaker signs of ECM association (highlighted by an asterisk in Fig. 4B). Despite the fact that the vast majority of the T1:T3 and T2:T3 chimeras were partitioned to the conditioned media, there were still a small proportion of the proteins that were sequestered to the ECM. Taken together, our data indicated that the ECM binding motif of TIMP-3 was made up of two independent modules, one on each domain of the molecule. Resolving the issue henceforth involved independent delineation of the modules from both termini of the TIMP. Delineating the ECM Binding Module on the N-terminal Domain of TIMP-3—All T3:TX chimeras and their site-directed mutants could be expressed and secreted and the yields of the recombinant proteins were consistently higher than that of wild-type TIMP-3. Fig. 5 summarizes the ECM binding profiles of T3:T1, T3:T2, and T3:T4 and their various site-directed mutants. The mutations introduced to identify the ECM binding module on N-TIMP-3 were essentially the same as those mentioned in the first section of the “Results”: (i) K26E single mutant (ii) K26/30E double mutant (iii) K26/27/76E triple mutant, and (iv) K26/27/30/76E quadruple mutant. Among the three, T3:T1 was the most vulnerable to mutations. A single substitution (K26E) was sufficient to dissociate most of the recombinant protein from the ECM. Replacement of a further lysine (K26/30E) resulted in a mutant that was entirely soluble. T3:T2 followed, instead of two mutations, three lysine-to-glutamate substitutions (K26/27/76E) were required to render the chimera non-ECM adherent. The chimera most tightly bound to the ECM was T3:T4. Despite four mutations (K26/27/30/76E) at its N-terminal, there was still a minute trace of the recombinant protein sequestered to the ECM (Fig. 5C). It is of interest to note that the ECM binding affinities of the T3:TX chimeras are not strictly related to the number of C-terminal lysine/arginine residues of the particular TIMP with which N-TIMP-3 is fused. With five lysines and three arginines, C-TIMP-2 boasts the highest number of basic residues (seven in C-TIMP-4; five in C-TIMP-1; Fig. 1B) and yet, the most tightly binding of the three is T3:T4. The impact exerted by the C-terminal domain, therefore, is very much dependent on the pattern of distribution as well as the spacing between the individual residues involved. Delineating the ECM Binding Module on the C-terminal Domain of TIMP-3—Because T4:T3 was undetectable by reverse zymography, only the chimeras of T1:T3 and T2:T3 could be used to identify the ECM binding module on C-TIMP-3. Following the same strategy outlined in section 1, the five most conspicuous C-terminal lysines and arginine were targeted for mutation: Lys-123, Lys-125, Lys-137, Arg-163, and Lys-165. Instead of alanine, the residues were mutated to glutamine (Q) as we found, during the course of this study, that TIMP-3-bearing glutamine substitutions (i.e. X-to-Q) were generally more easily expressed than those with alanine substitutions (data not shown). A clear and consistent profile emerged from the two panels of chimeras: while mutants with Lys-123 (K123Q), Lys-125 (K125Q), and Lys-137 (K137Q) mutations retained their ECM binding characteristics, those with Arg-613 (R163Q) and Lys-165 (K165Q) mutations had little, if any, affinity for the ECM. Furthermore, the profiles were identical in both panels of T1:T3 and T2:T3 chimeras (Fig. 6). Thus, the conclusion from this study was that Arg-163 and Lys-165 were essential parts of the ECM binding module on the C-terminal domain of TIMP-3. Reunion of the Two Domains: the Creation of a Soluble TIMP-3—We had so far treated the ECM binding motif as two independent N- and C-terminal modules. Could a soluble TIMP-3 be made by the reunion of the two domains? To this end, we combined the four N-terminal mutations (K26E, K27E, K30E, and K76E, identified in section 3) with the two C-terminal mutations (R163Q and K165Q, identified in section 4) to generate a compounded TIMP-3 mutant: K26/27/30/76E + R163/K165Q. The ECM binding profiles of the mutant in HeLa, MCF-7, HT1080, and COS-7 are shown in Fig. 7. Indeed, the mutant was exclusively soluble and no trace of the protein was detected in the ECM. As with previous Lys-to-Glu mutants, the soluble TIMP-3 also migrated slightly faster than its wild-type TIMP-3 counterpart. Transfection and overexpression of the mutant in MCF-7, HT1080, and COS-7 cell lines all yielded recombinant proteins that were soluble and non ECM-adhering (Fig. 7, B-D).

The convertases that catalyze this reaction assemble from fragments of complement components via multistep reactions. In the lectin pathway, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins bind to pathogens and activate MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2). MASP-2 cleaves C4 releasing C4a and generating C4b, which attaches covalently to the pathogen surface upon exposure of its reactive thioester. C2 binds to C4b and is also cleaved by MASP-2 to form the C3 convertase (C4b2a). To understand how this complex process is coordinated, we have analyzed the interactions between MASP-2, C4, C2, and their activation fragments and have compared MASP-2-catalyzed cleavage of C4b2 and C2. The data show that C2 binds tightly to C4b but not to C4, implying that C4 and C2 do not circulate as preformed complexes but that C2 is recruited only after prior activation of C4. Following cleavage of C4, C4b still binds to MASP-2 (KD ∼ 0.6 μm) and dissociates relatively slowly (koff ∼ 0.06 s–1) compared with the half-life of the thioester (≤0.7 s) (Sepp, A., Dodds, A. W., Anderson, M. J., Campbell, R. D., Willis, A. C., and Law, S. K. (1993) Protein Sci. 2, 706–716). We propose that the C4b·MASP-2 interaction favors attachment of C4b near to the activating MBL·MASP complex on the bacterial surface so that, following recruitment of C2, the proximity of enzyme and substrate (C4b2) combined with more favorable reaction kinetics drive the formation of the C3 convertase, promoting complement activation.

Complement is a fundamental part of the immune system, providing protection against invading microorganisms through both antibody-dependent and -independent mechanisms (1Porter R.R. Reid K.B.M. Nature. 1978; 275: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It also mediates many cellular and humoral interactions within the immune response, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, cell adhesion, and B-cell differentiation (2Carroll M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Three different pathways initiate the complement cascade, the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways (3Whaley K. Schwaeble W. Semin. Liver Dis. 1997; 17: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the classical pathway, component C1q binds to a variety of targets, including immune complexes, to initiate the stepwise activation of associated serine proteases, C1r and C1s, thereby providing a major mechanism for pathogen clearance following engagement by the adaptive immune system. In the alternative pathway, spontaneous low level hydrolysis of component C3 effects deposition of protein fragments onto cell surfaces, triggering complement activation on pathogens. Regulatory proteins on host tissues avert activation, preventing self-damage. In the lectin pathway (4Schwaeble W. Dahl M. Thiel S. Stover C. Jensenius J.

They are homologues of C1r and C1s of the classical pathway and comprise two CUB domains (domain found in the complement component Clr/Cls, Uegf, and bone morphogenic protein 1) separated by a Ca2+-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain and followed by two CCP modules and a serine protease domain. MASPs normally circulate as zymogens bound to MBL and ficolins through their CUB and epidermal growth factor-like domains (9Wallis R. Dodd R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30962-30969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When the lectin components bind to a target cell, MASP-1 and -2 activate through autolysis at a specific site within a linker region at the N-terminal end of the serine protease domain. Only MASP-2 has a clearly defined role in complement activation. It initially cleaves C4 to produce the peptide anaphylatoxin C4a and the C4b fragment, which attaches to the cell surface. C2 then binds to C4b and is also cleaved by MASP-2 to generate C2b and C2a. C2a remains attached to C4b to become the catalytic component of the C3 convertase (C4b2a) (10Kerr M.A. Biochem.

MASP-1 cleaves C2 but not C4, so it might enhance complement activation triggered by lectin · MASP-2 complexes, but cannot initiate activation itself (12Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). MASP-3 does not autoactivate, so is probably activated through the action of an unknown protease (13Zundel S. Cseh S. Lacroix M. Dahl M.R. Matsushita M. Andrieu J.P. Schwaeble W.J. Jensenius J.C.

Indeed, in vitro, zymogen MASP-2 interacts weakly with C4 through accessory-binding sites, even though the catalytic site is disrupted. These accessory sites, which probably include one or both of the CCP modules of the MASP, only become exposed upon activation of the MBL·MASP-2 complex, thereby enabling MASP-2 to bind to C4 (12Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Additional changes at the catalytic site allow the MASP to cleave its substrates. Complement activation must be tightly regulated to prevent tissue damage. Stable attachment of components to the surface of pathogens is one of the mechanisms employed by the host. MBL·MASP complexes bind tightly to pathogens through multivalent interactions between the carbohydrate recognition domains of MBL and arrays of mannose-like sugars on cell surfaces (16Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Analogous interactions between fibrinogen-like domains of ficolins and N-acetyl groups on pathogens immobilize ficolin·MASP complexes (17Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). When a lectin·MASP complex cleaves C4, the C4b fragment also attaches to the pathogen following exposure of a thioester, which reacts with the cell surface (18Law S.K. Dodds A.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 19Møller-Kristensen M. Thiel S. Hansen A.G. Jensenius J.C. Scand. J. Immunol. 2003; 57: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For complement activation to proceed, the C4b fragment must be close enough to a lectin·MASP complex so that the MASP can cleave C2 once it has bound to C4b. Control of this process is relatively poorly understood. Co-localization is probably achieved, in part, by the high reactivity of the thioester bond of C4b toward hydroxyl, or amino, groups on the pathogen surface. Nevertheless, additional processes probably increase the efficiency of complement activation in vivo. In this manuscript, we have investigated the steps leading to C3 convertase formation by analyzing the molecular interactions between MASP-2, C4, and C2 and their activation fragments. Based on our findings, we propose a model to explain how interactions between MASP-2 and C4b coordinate the activation process following pathogen recognition. Materials—Tissue culture media were from Invitrogen. l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Amino Acid Sequencing—Amino acid sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 494A Procise protein sequencer. Samples were run for 10 cycles using standard sequencing cycles. Production of Proteins and Protein Fragments—Recombinant proteins were used in these studies to ensure that preparations were not contaminated by trace amounts of other complement proteins. Previous work has demonstrated that components are processed correctly during biosynthesis and retain the key properties of native material (12Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25894-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat complement components C2 and C4 and catalytically active and inactive forms of rat MASP-2, called MASP-2K and MASP-2A, respectively, were produced by expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified as described previously (12Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25894-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MASP-2A comprises full-length MASP-2 in which the active site serine residue at position 613 is changed to an alanine. It was converted from the zymogen to the activated form by incubation with trypsin (0.25% w/w) for 1 h at 37 °C in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 1). Edman degradation of the C-terminal fragment confirmed that cleavage occurred at the expected site for zymogen activation. Residual trypsin activity was inhibited by the addition of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (0.1 mg/ml final concentration), and protein was dialyzed against reaction buffer to remove excess inhibitor. MASP-2K consists of full-length MASP-2 in which the arginine residue at the cleavage site for zymogen activation (Arg424) is replaced by a lysine residue (12Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This change reduces the rate of autocatalysis and thereby prevents activation of the zymogen during biosynthesis, secretion, and purification, allowing preparation of pure zymogen. MASP-2K was activated by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h in reaction buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2. Complement component C4b was generated from C4 by incubation with activated MASP-2K (0.02% w/w) for 1.5 h at 37 °C in reaction buffer (Fig. 1D). The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, as described above. Cleavage of all proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and protein fragments were quantified by scanning gels using a Chemigenius bioimaging system from Syngene. C4(met), in which the thioester has become exposed by reaction with methylamine, was produced by incubation of C4 with methylamine at pH 8 for 1 h at 37 °C. Before further analysis, all proteins were dialyzed against reaction buffer. Proteolysis of the C4b2 Complex—The catalytic activity of MASP-2K toward C4b2 was measured by incubating activated MASP-2K (1–2 nm) with increasing concentrations of C2 (0.1–2 μm) in the presence of excess C4b (2.5 μm) in reaction buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and ovalbumin (40 μg/ml) at 37 °C. C2 and C4b were preincubated for 30 min before the addition of enzyme to allow complex formation. At various times, aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by boiling in gel-loading buffer. The extent of C2 cleavage was determined by scanning SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To correct for minor differences in the amounts of sample loaded onto the gels, values were normalized using the amount of ovalbumin in each aliquot as a reference. A similar assay was used to measure cleavage of C2, except that the concentration of activated MASP-2 was 1 nm and the concentration of C2 was between 1 and 10 μm. Initial rates were calculated from the first 10% of cleavage or less. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear regression using the software Origin from Microcal. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium experiments were carried out as described previously in a Beckman XLA-70 centrifuge using epon charcoal-filled six-hole centerpieces (21Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Before analysis, all proteins were dialyzed extensively against reaction buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. To measure the interaction between activated MASP-2A and C4b, proteins were mixed at different molar ratios to give initial absorbances of 0.1–0.6 at 280 nm. Data were analyzed using the program 2C1SFIT, which implements conservation of mass constraints to model the equilibrium distributions globally (23Minton A.P. Progress in Colloid and Polymer Science. 1997; 107: 11-19Crossref Google Scholar). The apparent equilibrium association constant and the fraction of competent components were allowed to vary as global fitting parameters. Apparent equilibrium association constants were converted to molar dissociation constants as described previously (24Rivas G. Stafford W. Minton A.P. Methods. 1999; 19: 194-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Values are mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. It was assumed that no changes in the partial specific volumes occur on complex formation and that the molecular mass of the complex is the sum of that of the components. Molecular masses of MASP-2 and C4 were determined from experiments run in parallel (see Table 1) by fitting equilibrium data at three different loading concentrations to a model assuming a single solution species, using software supplied with the centrifuge.TABLE 1Biophysical properties of complement componentsProteinUnmodified monomer molecular massPartial specific volumeSedimentation coefficient (s20,w)Weight-averaged molecular masskDaml/gSkDaMASP-2A74.80.7225.50 ± 0.02139 ± 1C283.20.7305.35 ± 0.04N.D.C4190.00.7328.01 ± 0.02200aData from Ref. 12.C4b181.60.7327.31 ± 0.16187 ± 4a Data from Ref. 12Chen C.B.

Open table in a new tab Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 40,000 revolutions/min and at 20 °C using aluminum centerpieces. Prior to setting up the experiments, proteins were dialyzed against reaction buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Scans were collected at 2–4-min intervals at 230 nm. Data were analyzed using the program DCDT (25Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Values are displayed as s20,w (Table 1) by correcting for the effects of buffers (26Laue T.M. Bhairavi D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymers Science, Royal Society of Chemistry, London. 1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance—Measurements were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore). Protein ligands were diluted to 25 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.5 (for C4, C4b and C4(met)) or pH 3.5 or 4.0 (for activated MASP-2A) and immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore) using amine-coupling chemistry (BIAcore amine-coupling kit). Binding was measured in reaction buffer at a flow rate of 5 μl/min and at 25 °C. Regeneration of the protein surfaces between analyses was achieved by injection of 10 μl of 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5, containing 1 m NaCl. Data were analyzed by fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model for several protein concentrations simultaneously, using BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants (koff/kon). Kinetics of C4 Binding to Substrate—Binding of C4b to a substrate S can be described by the following reaction scheme: Measurements of C4 activation for a variety of species have been made using small substrates such as glycine and glycerol (27Sepp A. Dodds A.W. Anderson M.J. Campbell R.D. Willis A.C. Law S.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Under pseudo-first order conditions, where [S] ≫ [C4b], the proportion of C4b binding to substrate is [S]·k1/k0. For human C4B, kopen is too rapid to measure. The pseudo-first order rate constant for hydrolysis, k0 (= k·[H2O], where k is the second order rate constant for hydrolysis), has been estimated as ≥1s–1 at 22 °C (t½ ≤ 0.7 s). Thus, k0 provides a lower limit for [S]·k1, assuming that at least equivalent amounts of C4b bind to substrate as are inactivated through hydrolysis. Complement activation normally occurs on the surfaces of pathogens. Nevertheless, solution studies have provided key insights into the activation process. In this manuscript, we have adopted both solution and solid-phase approaches to study the molecular interactions leading to C3 convertase formation in the lectin pathway. Similar processes on the surfaces of pathogens probably help to regulate complement activation in vivo. Recruitment of C2 by C4b—C2 binds to C4b with high affinity (28Laich A. Sim R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1544: 96-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, binding between C2 and C4 has not been analyzed. Even a weak interaction between these components would probably facilitate C3 convertase formation, because both substrates would be present at the same time for their stepwise activation by a lectin·MASP-2 complex. We therefore examined whether C4 binds to C2. Freshly prepared C4 was used in these experiments to minimize hydrolysis of the thioester, which occurs spontaneously in solution but at a low rate. This precaution was necessary, because thioester hydrolyzed, but peptide bond-intact C4 binds to C2, and the resulting complexes would have similar properties to C4b2 complexes. Samples at concentrations comparable with those that occur in vivo were analyzed by velocity analytical ultracentrifugation using the time derivative method g(s*) to display the distribution of apparent sedimentation coefficients (s*). Using this approach, complexes can be distinguished from free components by differences in the rates at which they sediment. In a mixture of C2 and C4, the s* distribution corresponded closely to the sum of the distributions of the components analyzed separately (Fig. 2A), indicating that C2 and C4 do not interact with each other over the range of concentrations examined. By contrast, when C4b was mixed with C2, a new peak was observed corresponding to a complex, which sedimented faster than either of the free components, confirming that C4b binds to C2 (Fig. 2B). Only small amounts of unassociated species were detected in the mixture, indicating that the KD of the C4b2 complex is considerably lower than the loading concentration of the components (0.2 μm), consistent with previous studies in which the KD for the interaction between human C4b and C2 was determined as ∼1 × 10–8 m (28Laich A. Sim R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1544: 96-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that C2 and C4 do not interact with each other before activation of C4. However, following cleavage of C4, C2 binds tightly to C4b to form the C4b2 complex, which is subsequently cleaved again to form the C3 convertase. Interactions between Activated MASP-2 and C4b—Binding between MASP-2 and C4b, following activation of C4, would help to ensure that C4b attaches to the pathogen surface close to the lectin·MASP-2 complex. Co-localization of these components, in turn, would increase the probability of cleavage of the C4b2 complex by the same MASP and would thus help to coordinate C3 convertase formation. Following cleavage of C4, the C4b fragment undergoes a conformational change that exposes the thioester. Nevertheless, at least some of the MASP-binding sites might still remain after the conformational change. To examine this possibility, we tested whether MASP-2 binds to C4b. In a mixture of activated MASP-2A and C4b, the amount of unassociated MASP-2 decreased, and the average s* increased relative to the individual components measured separately, indicating that MASP-2A does indeed bind to C4b (Fig. 3). Some of the MASP was still unassociated in the mixture, so the KD is probably greater than the loading concentration of the components (0.4 μm). To investigate binding between MASP-2A and C4b further, samples were analyzed by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. In a mixture of both components, more protein was distributed toward the bottom of the cell compared with the sum of the equilibrium distributions of the components, confirming the presence of MASP-2A·C4b complexes (Fig. 4A). The strength of the interaction was quantified by comparing mixtures of MASP-2A and C4b at different molar ratios. Data from three separate experiments, each at two different loading concentrations, fit well to models assuming formation of 1:1 complexes in which the KD was 2.7 ± 1.3 μm (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the affinity of the interaction between activated MASP-2A and C4b is comparable with the affinity between zymogen MASP-2 and intact C4, characterized previously under comparable conditions (6.8 ± 2.0 μm) (12Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Gal P. Harmat V. Kocsis A. Bian T. Barna L. Ambrus G. Vegh B. Balczer J. Sim R.B. Naray-Szabo G. Zavodszky P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33435-33444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The latter interaction is mediated through accessory-binding sites on the MASP, which become exposed following activation of the MBL·MASP complex, thereby lowering the Km for catalysis of C4. Given their comparable affinities, it is likely that MASP-2 binds to C4 and C4b through the same binding sites, implying that the binding surface is maintained upon cleavage of C4, despite the subsequent conformational change. Although the affinity of the interaction between activated MASP-2 and C4b is relatively low compared with many protein-protein interactions (e.g. binding between C4b and C2), it is unusually high for an enzyme·product complex, where affinities are often in the mm range. Binding between enzyme and product might help to localize C4b near the lectin·MASP-2 complex on the pathogen by trapping the C4b molecule until it has attached covalently to the cell surface. The probability of such a process is dependent on the relative magnitudes of the rate of dissociation of C4b from MASP-2 (koff) following cleavage of C4 and the rates at which the thioester is exposed and subsequently reacts with its substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). When dissociation is of a similar magnitude or slower than the reactivity of the thioester, a significant proportion of C4b molecules are likely to bind covalently to hydroxyl or amino groups on the cell surface before their release by the enzyme. To analyze the kinetics of the interaction between C4b and MASP-2, each component was immobilized in turn, and binding by its soluble partner was measured using surface plasmon resonance. Data for MASP-2A binding to immobilized C4b are shown in Fig. 5A, and the kinetic parameters from all experiments are summarized in Table 2. Reassuringly, the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants were comparable irrespective of whether MASP-2A or C4b was attached to the sensor chip. Furthermore, the KD values (at 25 °C; calculated from koff/kon) were broadly comparable with the KD measured by equilibrium ultracentrifugation (at 20 °C), demonstrating that immobilization of either component did not impair binding greatly. The koff values were 7.4 ± 4 × 10–2 (t½ = 11.5 ± 4.8 s) and 4.6 ± 1.4 × 10–2 s–1 (t½ = 16.7 ± 5.1 s) using immobilized C4b and MASP-2A, respectively. By comparison, the half-life of the thioester in human C4B is ≤0.7 s (27Sepp A. Dodds A.W. Anderson M.J. Campbell R.D. Willis A.C. Law S.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (see “Kinetics of C4 Binding to Substrate” above). Therefore, assuming that the activation kinetics of rat C4 are broadly comparable with those of human C4B, then a significant proportion of C4b molecules are likely to bind to substrate before release from the MASP. Thus, the relatively slow dissociation of C4b from MASP-2 probably helps to co-localize these components on an activating surface, thereby enabling subsequent cleavage of C2 by the same MASP.TABLE 2Kinetic properties of the interactions between C4 and C4b with activated MASP-2AImmobilized proteinSoluble proteinkonaMean value determined from two separate experiments.koffaMean value determined from two separate experiments.KDm-1 s-1s-1μmC4bMASP-2A1.9 ± 0.3 × 1057.4 ± 4 × 10-20.5 ± 0.3C4MASP-2A4.7 ± 0.7 × 1050.7 ± 0.2 × 10-20.05 ± 0.03MASP-2AC4b1.2 ± 0.5 × 1054.6 ± 1.4 × 10-20.7 ± 0.3MASP-2AC43.4 ± 0.7 × 1052.3 ± 0.5 × 10-20.19 ± 0.07a Mean value determined from two separate experiments. Open table in a new tab To further probe the activation mechanism, we also measured the interactions of MASP-2A with C4 and C4(met) (Fig. 5 and Table 2). MASP-2A bound to C4 4–10-fold more tightly than to C4b, probably because of additional contacts between the enzyme and substrate at or near the active site. Interestingly, very little binding was detected between MASP-2A and C4(met), even though the amount of C4(met) bound to the sensor chip was comparable with the amounts of C4 and C4b (Fig. 5C). Likewise, only minimal binding was detected between soluble C4(met) and immobilized MASP-2A at concentrations of C4(met) up to 0.5 μm. We conclude that MASP-2 binds more weakly to C4(met) than to C4b, despite both proteins undergoing similar conformational changes upon cleavage of the thioester. The most likely explanation for this observation is that the C4a fragment, which is still covalently attached in C4(met) but not in C4b, impairs MASP-2 binding. Catalysis of the C4b2 Complex by MASP-2—During formation of the C3 convertase, C4b, the product of the first MASP-2-catalyzed reaction, becomes part of the substrate of the second reaction (C4b2). Any persisting interactions between the MASP and the C4b component of C4b2 would be likely to affect the reaction kinetics. To investigate the role of C4b in the cleavage of C4b2, we compared the cleavage of C4b2 with the cleavage of C2 alone. Kinetic parameters are shown in Table 3, and examples of cleavage of C4b2 and C2 by MASP-2K on polyacrylamide gels are shown in Fig. 6. Both reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics over the concentration ranges examined. There is a modest increase in the catalytic efficiency of C4b2 cleavage compared with C2 cleavage, which is characterized by a 7-fold lower Km value and a smaller reduction in kcat (Table 3). Thus, C4b binding modifies the kinetics of C2 cleavage catalyzed by MASP-2. The significance of these findings are discussed below.TABLE 3Kinetic properties of activated MASP-2K with protein substratesSubstrateKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1μm-1 s-1C25.1 ± 0.63.9 ± 1.60.85 ± 0.42C4b20.72 ± 0.071.1 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab The data presented here suggest novel mechanisms for the regulation of C3 convertase formation during complement activation by the lectin pathway. By combining these findings with existing knowledge, we revised the current model for the early stages of complement activation (Fig. 7). When MBL·MASP-2 or ficolin·MASP-2 complexes bind to the surface of a pathogen, conformational changes trigger MASP autoactivation. Activated MASP-2 binds to C4 through accessory-binding sites on the CCP domains as well as at the active site within the protease domain, leading to cleavage of the C4 polypeptide (12Chen C.B. Wallis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26058-26065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The newly exposed thioester on C4b reacts with hydroxyl or amino groups on the bacterial cell surface before dissociation from the MASP, thus binding proximally to the activating lectin·MASP-2 complex. Co-localization of these components facilitates subsequent cleavage of incoming C2 molecules by the same MASP, thereby coordinating activation. Intriguing questions still remain concerning the order of events during the initial stages of complement activation. For example, it is uncertain whether C4a is released from C4b immediately after cleavage by the lectin·MASP complex (as shown in Fig. 7) or at a later stage. Interestingly, during C3 activation, C3a remains associated with C3b and may not be released until the larger C3b fragment is broken down to iC3b (29Janatova J. Tack B.F. Prahl J.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4479-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is important to acknowledge that complement activation normally occurs on the surfaces of foreign cells in serum, which is a very different environment from those typically used for in vitro studies. In vivo, activation is controlled by a variety of regulators and inhibitors, and many different serum proteins and carbohydrates interact with components to modulate the process. For example, in the classical pathway, C1 inhibitor plays a major role in the activation efficiency of C1s, the classical pathway homologue of MASP-2, by binding and inhibiting C1 and the subsequent activation of C2 and C4 (30Ziccardi R.J. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1769-1773PubMed Google Scholar). C1 inhibitor also binds and inhibits MASP-2 (11Rossi V. Cseh S. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40880-40887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and so might play a comparable role in the lectin pathway, although the kinetics of the interaction have not been examined. The fate of activating MBL·MASP complexes on a cell surface is thus likely to depend on the relative rates of recruitment of substrates compared with binding by the C1 inhibitor, as well as to the influences of other regulators. In the classical pathway, it has been estimated that only 35 C4 molecules and four C2 molecules are activated for each activating C1 complex due to inhibition by the C1 inhibitor (30Ziccardi R.J. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1769-1773PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this rate of turnover is sufficient to trigger activation, which is subsequently amplified further by latter steps in the reaction cascade. Complement is also regulated by polysaccharides, such as heparin and heparan sulfate, which bind to many complement components, including C4, C1 inhibitor, and more weakly to C2 (31Yu H. Munoz E.M. Edens R.E. Linhardt R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1726: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although these and other protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions might modulate enzyme activities or compete for substrate binding, they are unlikely to change the underlying activation mechanism proposed here, because the key step of C4b deposition onto the activating surface (such as a bacterial cell wall) is faster than its release from MASP-2 and therefore happens while C4b is still attached to the enzyme. It is relatively unusual for the product of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction to bind to its enzyme with appreciable affinity, because such interactions are likely to reduce the efficiency of catalysis by blocking the catalytic site. During formation of the C3 convertase, however, interactions between the product of the first reaction (C4b) and the enzyme (MASP-2) probably help to coordinate the two-step reaction on the pathogen surface by reducing the probability of additional C4 cleavage while increasing the chances of C4b2 cleavage. In addition, the proximity of C4b2 and MASP-2 will increase the effective concentration of substrate (C4b2) greatly, thus driving formation of the convertase. Interestingly, although the Km value for C2 cleavage decreases by 7-fold when C4b binds to C2, the increase in the catalytic efficiency of the reaction in solution is relatively modest (∼2-fold). As discussed above, on the surface of a bacterial cell, cleavage of C4b2 is likely to be driven by its high effective concentration. Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider the kinetics of the reaction in solution and the changes that occur when C2 binds to C4b. Cleavage of C4 and C4b2 by MASP-2 are both characterized by relatively low Km values, which, for C4 at least, is because of a relatively low KD value for the enzyme·substrate complex. Generally, a relatively stable enzyme·substrate complex is likely to improve substrate specificity but at the expense of catalysis (because of the increase in the resulting energy barrier). However, such properties might be advantageous in the complement cascade, where control of activation is particularly important. The data would be consistent with this model in which a decrease in the Km value for C4b2 cleavage compared with C2 cleavage alone is partially offset by a corresponding decrease in the kcat value. An alternative explanation for the differences in catalysis of C4b2 and C2 is that binding to C4b induces a conformational change in C2. Indeed, a similar explanation has been proposed in the classical pathway for cleavage of C4b-bound C2 by C1s. Once cleavage of the C4b2 complex is complete, the MASP will be free for subsequent rounds of catalysis. Consequently, activation probably results in each lectin·MASP-2 complex becoming surrounded by multiple C3 convertase complexes. Because substrates, inhibitors, and regulators must bind to activating complexes, steric factors might affect complement activation in vivo. As more proteins are deposited onto the surface, further access might become blocked. Consequently, any C4b molecules that attach to the pathogen surface further away from the initiating lectin·MASP-2 complex can still bind to C2 but are less likely to be converted to C4b2a complexes, because the MASP is not close enough to catalyze the second step of the reaction. Under these circumstances, C4b2 cleavage will only occur when another lectin·MASP complex binds close enough to catalyze the reaction. An important assumption that we have made in our analysis is that the kinetics of rat C4 activation and substrate binding are similar to those of human C4B. It is important to consider whether this assumption is likely to be valid. Comparison of the reactivities of C4 isolated from a variety of species has shown that rat C4, similar to human C4B and most other mammalian C4s, has a preference for hydroxyl groups as substrates, whereas human C4A is more reactive toward amino and thiol groups (32Dodds A.W. Law S.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These differences are due largely to a single amino acid difference at position 1106 (His in C4B and rat C4 and Asp in C4A) (33Dodds A.W. Ren X.D. Willis A.C. Law S.K. Nature. 1996; 379: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The relative reactivities (k1rat·k0C4B/k0rat·k1C4B) of rat C4 and human C4B are 1.12 and 1.24 using glycine and glycerol as substrates (32Dodds A.W. Law S.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, although absolute rate constants for rat C4 have not been determined, it is likely that the kinetics are similar to those of human C4B. It is also worth noting that, in our analysis, we have used the rate of hydrolysis of C4B as a measure of the half-life of the thioester. On the surface of a bacterial cell, the effective concentrations of the more reactive hydroxyl and amino groups are likely to be extremely high, so the half-life of the thioester is probably much shorter. The C3 convertase of the classical pathway is formed by a mechanism similar to that in the lectin pathway, although, in this case, C1s catalyzes cleavage of C4 and C2. Formation of the C3 convertase might be regulated in a manner similar to that for the lectin pathway. Indeed, analysis of classical pathway activation has revealed that accessory-binding sites, probably located within the CCP modules of C1s, also facilitate recognition of C4 in a manner analogous to those between MASP-2 and C4 (34Rossi V. Bally I. Thielens N.M. Esser A.F. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1232-1239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, although C1s and MASP-2 share the same substrates, binding through the protease domains of the enzymes is achieved through different enzyme·substrate contacts (35Harmat V. Gal P. Kardos J. Szilagyi K. Ambrus G. Vegh B. Naray-Szabo G. Zavodszky P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Likewise, the CCP modules of MASP-2 have a higher C4 recognition efficacy than the equivalent domains of C1s, implying that there are additional differences in contacts between the two systems (15Rossi V. Teillet F. Thielens N.M. Bally I. Arlaud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41811-41818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be very interesting to examine classical pathway activation to reveal whether mechanisms similar to those described here help to coordinate C3 convertase formation."

Low levels of HDL represent a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and there is growing interest in therapies that can enhance HDL plasma levels or its anti-atherogenic activity (1Linsel-Nitschke P. Tall A.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) comprises ∼70% of the protein content of HDL and is a primary determinant of HDL structure, composition, and stability. ApoA-I is a prominent member of the exchangeable apolipoprotein class of proteins, and HDL derives a large portion of its functionality from the ability of apoA-I to sequester phospholipid and cholesterol and functionally interact with plasma enzymes and cellular receptors (for a recent review see Ref. 2Marcel Y.L.

This approach allowed us to both describe the structure of the lipid-free apoA-I C terminus (residues 163-241) and also report on the structural changes that arise because of lipidation.

We also identify sites of more stable tertiary interactions in an otherwise conformational dynamic segment of the protein. To observe the effect of lipid binding on the structure of the N terminus, the spin-labeled samples were analyzed in reconstituted HDL discs, providing insight into the adaptive response that the secondary structure of apoA-I undergoes during lipidation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Thio-specific nitroxide spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTS-SL) was received as a kind gift from Dr. K. Hideg (University of Pecs, Hungary). Standard molecular biology procedures were used to create the different plasmid constructs. All mutagenic primers were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX), and Davis Sequencing (Davis, CA) performed DNA sequence determination.Construction, Expression, Purification, and MTS Labeling of ApoA-I Mutants—PCR mutagenesis was applied on an apoA-I template enhanced for bacterial expression (10Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Dideoxy DNA sequencing confirmed the substitutions and the absence of unwanted changes. The resulting constructs expressed apoA-I mutant proteins with single substitutions of the native amino acids for cysteines, and the mutants were purified and labeled with MTS-SL as described previously (3Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, the apoA-I protein was sequentially incubated with 100 μm Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 300 μm MTS spin label on a Ni2+-chelated HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) under denaturing conditions (3 m guanidine-HCl). The protein purity was estimated higher than 95% by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The protein concentration was determined by use of the MicroBCA assay kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard.ApoA-I Lipidation—Reconstituted nascent HDL were prepared by a modified method originally described by Nichols et al. (11Nichols A.V. Gong E.L.

To 0.5 ml of 16.3 mm 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (POPC) in TBS, pH 8 was added an equal volume of TBS, pH 8, 22 mm sodium deoxycholate. The mixture was vortexed and incubated at 37 °C until completely clear. 3 mg of spin-labeled apoA-I was added to the cleared dispersion (1:2.04 w/w apoA-I:POPC) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Deoxycholate was removed by extensive dialysis against TBS, pH 8. Reconstituted nascent HDL was recovered by KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation at 50,000 × g for 3 h in a Beckman Optima TLA 100.4 rotor. Fractions containing both protein and lipid were pooled and dialyzed against TBS, pH 7.4. The size of lipidated discoidal complexes was confirmed by gradient gel electrophoresis (11Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).EPR Analysis—EPR measurements were carried out in a JEOL X-band spectrometer fitted with a loop-gap resonator (13Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 515-521Google Scholar, 14Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For room temperature spectra, an aliquot (5 μl) of purified, spin-labeled protein (100 μm) was placed in a sealed quartz capillary contained in the resonator. Spectra were acquired at room temperature (20-22 °C) from a single 60-s scan over a field of 100 G at a microwave power of 2 milliwatt and a modulation amplitude optimized to the natural line width of the individual spectrum (0.5-1.5 G). The spectra were normalized by the intensity of their integrals. For frozen spectra (-100 °C), samples were first flash-frozen in sealed capillaries by rapid immersion into a butane bath cooled in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then placed in a TE cavity and scanned over 100 G using a microwave power of 0.1 milliwatt and modulation width of 1 G.Molecular accessibility of spin-labeled side chains to chromium oxalate (CrOx) and O2 was determined using successive power saturation scans as described (15Oh K.J. Altenbach C. Collier R.J. Hubbell W.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 147-169PubMed Google Scholar). ∏½ values (which also were used to calculate the contrast function (Φ)) were calculated using software provided by C. Altenbach.Molecular Modeling—Insight II software (version 2005) on the Octane work station by Silicon Graphics was used for structural modeling. The protein data bank coordinates of crystalline lipid-free apoA-I (code 2A01) (16Ajees A.A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Mishra V.K. Hussain M.M. Murthy H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2126-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) were used as templates.RESULTSSDSL-EPR Analysis of Lipid-free ApoA-I—The chemical and structural properties of the N-terminal one-third of apoA-I were examined by EPR spectroscopy. Here, 82 individual cysteine substitution mutants of apoA-I were created between residues 14 and 98. 4Pro-66 was not substituted in order to preserve its unique backbone conformation. Thr-79 was omitted due to poor expression. These 82 cysteine substitution variants of apoA-I were expressed in bacteria, purified, and labeled at the cysteine sulfhydryl with nitroxide label. The EPR spectra obtained from these protein samples (Fig. 1A) reported on the immediate milieu of the labeled side chains. Strong immobilization of the side chain is observed as spectral broadening (for example, see spectra for V30C and L75C in Fig. 1A), whereas a high degree of side chain motional freedom is characterized by a sharpness of the spectra (Fig. 1A, G35C and V53C spectra). The inverse central line width (δ-1, Gauss-1), a parameter that directly reflects the side chain mobility (17Hubbell W.L. Mchaourab H.A. Altenbach C. Lietzow M.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 779-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), was used to determine the secondary structure (Fig. 1B, bottom). In addition, the collision frequency between the nitroxide on the labeled side chain and the polar or non-polar relaxation agents (chromium oxalate (CrOx) and oxygen (O2), respectively) was used to determine the accessibility (∏; Fig. 1B, upper graph) of the respective compound and thus also the chemical environment at the side chain. Based on the periodicity (generated from asymmetrical solvent or tertiary contacts) of these values, several regions were identified as α-helical with a helical pitch of 3.6 residues/turn.For example, residues 26-34 display an α-helical pattern with a periodicity between 3 and 4 for both the mobility and accessibility parameters. This can be seen in the EPR spectra of residues 26, 30, 33, and 34, the line shapes of which display immobilized, broadened features. The intervening residues exhibit more mobile spectra, and their ∏-values indicate they are in a more hydrophilic environment. Moreover, the residues with immobilized spectra are concentrated within a hydrophobic region in the helical wheel plot (Fig. 1D). The same approach was used to identify other α-helical regions. These are comprised of residues 36-42, 44-51, 55-85, and residues 92-98 (Fig. 1, B-D). Of these segments, the mobility parameter for residues 36-42 do not exhibit this periodicity, suggesting a more complex modulation of side chain dynamics in this region. However, the accessibility of the relaxation agents for these residues bears a helical periodicity, allowing for an assignment of helical secondary structure for residues 36-42.In addition, residues 20-25 bore an alternating periodicity of mobility consistent with β-strand structure. This conclusion is also supported by the non-polar accessibility parameter for this stretch of amino acids (Fig. 1B, ∏O2). The mobility parameter for residues 87-92 also demonstrates such a periodicity. However, because the accessibility data for this region do not support such a pattern and also because the overall mobility is high, we propose this region to be a loop; although the presence of β-strand structure cannot be completely excluded.In contrast to the clearly defined structural regions of the N-terminal third of apoA-I, there are segments of this region that appear unstructured (Fig. 1B, white). These loop regions typically exhibit spectra with high mobility and are also readily accessible by EPR relaxation agents. For example, the line shapes for spectra 51-55 are sharp with high δ-1 values (>0.4 Gauss-1). In particular, position 53 exhibits a spectrum that is similar in appearance to the spectra of unbound nitroxide. These residues thus clearly define a loop region. Similarly, the spectra of nitroxides at residues 35 and 43 also display high mobility, which does not fit with the helical pattern of the neighboring residues. Thus, residues 35 and 43 may also represent interruptions in the regular helical structure. By the same criteria, residues 86 to 91 have been assigned coil/turn secondary structure. The final assignment of secondary structure is summarized in Fig. 1C.Several of the EPR spectra of lipid-free apoA-I display a broadening (Fig. 2) indicative of dipolar coupling between two nitroxides. For proteins labeled with only one disulfide-linked nitroxide, the dipolar interaction must be intermolecular. At the concentrations of apoA-I used in this study, the quaternary state of apoA-I exists as a dynamic equilibrium between monomers, dimers, and higher order oligomers (18Vitello L.B. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1131-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the limited range in which dipolar broadening is observable (<20 Å) by continuous wave EPR and the small subset of residues, which exhibit dipolar spin coupling, we assign residues 26, 44, and 64 within the central plane of an antiparallel dimer. Further evaluation of the broadening as a function of the distance-dependent dipolar interaction was performed by collecting the EPR spectra of frozen samples. In the absence of motion (i.e. frozen in liquid N2), a semiquantitative analysis of the extent of broadening because of dipolar interaction can be obtained from the d1/d spectral ratio (19Likhtenshtein G.I. Biophysical Labeling Methods in Molecular Biology. Cambridge University Press, NY1993Crossref Google Scholar, 20Kokorin A.I. Zamaraev K.I. Grigorian G.L. Ivanov V.P. Rozantsev E.G. Biofizika. 1972; 17: 34-41PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). All four examined positions reveal a d1/d ratio between 0.38 and 0.41, confirming a weak dipolar coupling and therefore the close proximity of spin labels in the self-associated population. This alignment of amino acids allows for the synthesis of a tertiary model in which segments of secondary structure containing sites of self-interaction can be aligned relative to the central plane of the protein (3Oda M.N.

During this process the helical structure content increases from 45-58% (21Davidson W.S. Silva R.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to ∼80% for lipid-bound apoA-I (22Davidson W.S. Hazlett T. Mantulin W.W. Jonas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13605-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To examine the structural consequences of lipid binding, the spin-labeled apoA-I protein preparations described above were utilized in the formation of recombinant HDL. This allowed for a direct comparison of the EPR spectra of the N-terminal domain in two environmentally distinct states. Clearly, a majority of nitroxide-labeled side chains experienced a higher steric hindrance in the lipid-bound state compared with the lipid-free state. This is typified by generally broader spectral shapes for lipid-bound forms of the protein (Fig. 3A). The exceptions include positions Ser-31, Thr-56, and Leu-64, which all display an increased mobility in the lipid-bound state, whereas some side chains, such as Leu-42 and Arg-83, appear to be structurally unaffected.FIGURE 3Secondary structure analysis of lipid-bound apoA-I. Spin-labeled apoA-I mutant proteins in reconstituted HDL discs were analyzed by EPR. A, spectra were compared between lipid-bound (red) and lipid-free (black) apoA-I mutants. B, the accessibility parameters for polar (πCrOx) and non-polar (πO2) was used to calculate the contrast function Φ (filled squares), a measure of the hydrophobicity of the immediate environment to a spin-labeled side chain, which is plotted versus residue number. C, a periodicity of 3.67 residues/turn (23Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31755-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was used to identify the regions displaying α-helical character and for making the helical projection. The color code is black for hydrophobic (Met, Ile, Leu, Val, Phe, Tyr, Trp, Ala), orange for polar and uncharged (Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln), red for negatively charged (Asp, Glu), and blue for positively charged (Lys, His, Arg) residues. Glycine residues are shown in green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To define the helical faces in the apoA-I N terminus relative to lipid, the contrast function (Φ), which reflects the ratio between the accessibility parameters for O2 and CrOx (Fig. 3B). This value is especially useful for membrane-embedded proteins and lipoproteins because O2 dissolves particularly well in the hydrophobic lipid phase, and CrOx is highly hydrophilic. A helical pitch of 3.67 was used to define helical regions (Fig. 3B). This periodicity corresponds to an 11/3 helix, which has been proposed to better conform to the curvature of the periphery of the reconstituted HDL disc and arrange the hydrophobic and charged residues around the helical axis in comparison to a 3.6 helical pitch (23Segrest J.P.

The SDSL-EPR analysis of lipid-bound apoA-I suggests that residues 13-38 and 49-98 form two individual α-helices, and that the intervening residues display α-helical character (residues 43-47). The helical wheel display (Fig. 3C) shows that the distribution of hydrophobic and charged residues around the helical axis is in agreement with the expected amphipathic character of helices in lipid-bound apoA-I.DISCUSSIONThe first 90 amino acids of apoA-I compose a unique feature of this molecule. The distinctiveness of this region is highlighted by the presence of proteolytically derived N-terminal fragments (amino acids 1 to ∼83) of apoA-I within senile amyloid plaques. Interestingly, the first 43 amino acids of apoA-I are encoded by exon 3, which is the most highly conserved region of apoA-I, whereas the remainder of apoA-I is encoded by exon 4 (4Li W.H. Tanimura M. Luo C.C. Datta S. Chan L. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 245-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the apoA-I gene suggests that this region bears a critical role distinct from the remainder of apoA-I. Furthermore, lipid-free apoA-I lacking residues 1-43 adopts a conformation resembling lipid-bound apoA-I (8Rogers D.P. Brouillette C.G. Engler J.A. Tendian S.W. Roberts L. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ray M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus it has been hypothesized that these residues serve to stabilize the compact lipid-free conformation by protecting a latent lipid-binding domain, available only after initial lipid interaction (8Rogers D.P. Brouillette C.G. Engler J.A. Tendian S.W. Roberts L. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Ray M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Although the majority of positions throughout apoA-I display dynamics and molecular accessibility that is consistent with the recently solved crystal structure (16Ajees A.A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Mishra V.K. Hussain M.M. Murthy H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2126-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), results from EPR analysis suggest the conformation of the N-terminal domain in solution diverge significantly from the crystalline state. The first 90 amino acids in the crystal structure compose of two long α-helices flanked by loop regions, composing half of a four-helix bundle. However, lipid-poor apolipoproteins are in general noted for their dynamic properties, especially at their termini, and thus the highly ordered structure of crystalline apoA-I may not be representative of a prevalent conformer in solution. Because the thermodynamics of lipid binding are frequently driven by reorganization of secondary and tertiary structural elements, mapping the dynamics of the apoA-I polypeptide at its N-terminal region is an important step in elucidating the mechanism of lipid recognition and lipid-driven reorganization.As shown recently with the KvAP potassium channel (24Cuello L.G. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Science. 2004; 306: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and the MsbA multi-drug resistance protein (25Dong J. Yang G. McHaourab H.S. Science. 2005; 308: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), EPR of site-directed spin labels is useful for identifying conformers in solution that may not be observable when the protein is in a crystalline state. Such discrepancies are not entirely unexpected for apolipoproteins, the global conformational rearrangements of which require a dynamic lipid-free state for lipid sensing and structural conversion. In particular, the EPR data complement the crystal structure by identifying regions involved in hinge bending and misfolding (6Joy T. Wang J. Hahn A. Hegele R.A. Clin. Biochem. 2003; 36: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Andreola A. Bellotti V. Giorgetti S. Mangione P. Obici L. Stoppini M. Torres J. Monzani E. Merlini G. Sunde M. J. Biol.

Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Martin D.D. Budamagunta M.S. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Oda M.N. J. Biol.

Thus we find regions within both the C-(3) and N-terminal domains display conformational heterogeneity, consistent with two states in equilibrium. Our model for secondary structure in the N terminus of lipid-free apoA-I is based on the accessibility of side chains to paramagnetic relaxers (∏) and side chain mobility (δ-1). In the case of the former, the values will reflect the most predominant conformational state, whereas the simple δ-1 evaluation of side chain mobility may over-represent the more dynamic species when considering comparable populations of restricted and mobile side chains. The general agreement of the parameters (∏ and δ-1) as a function of N-terminal sequence position, along with the identification of sites displaying dipolar interaction, is reflected in the model shown in Fig. 4. Here the structure of the ground-state crystal conformer was modified according to the EPR results to produce a time-averaged conformer of lipid-free apoA-I in solution (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Model of apoA-I solution structure.

The side chains of residues 26, 44, 64, and 167, which are all suggested to be in the central plane of the structure, are shown in red.

The assignment of β-strand secondary structure in lipid-free apoA-I is in agreement with circular dichroism (CD) measurements of the protein in solution (28Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Fang J. Macha S.

Although the crystal structure of apoA-I provides the basis for an elegant model of nascent HDL formation, the fixed ground-state conformation of crystal structure does not reflect the substantial conformational dynamics inherent to apoA-I in solution. For example, the thermodynamics of folding suggest the protein experiences a loosely packed molten globule in solution (30Gursky O. Atkinson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These include sites of protease sensitivity in the N-terminal domain (31Roberts L.M. Ray M.J. Shih T.W. Hayden E. Reader"

The cells undergo dramatic changes in morphology and an ordered program of gene expression changes representing differentiation to all three germ layers over the first 3-5 days of LIF withdrawal. We observed a global increase in acetylation on histone H4 and to a lesser extent on histone H3 over this time period. Treatment of the cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, induced changes in morphology, gene expression, and histone acetylation that mimicked differentiation induced by withdrawal of LIF. We examined localized histone acetylation in the regulatory regions of genes that were transcriptionally either active in undifferentiated cells, induced during differentiation, or inactive under all treatments. There was striking concordance in the histone acetylation patterns of specific genes induced by both TSA and LIF withdrawal. Increased histone acetylation in local regions correlated best with induction of gene expression. Finally, TSA treatment did not support the maintenance or progression of differentiation. Upon removal of TSA, the cells reverted to the undifferentiated phenotype. We concluded that increased histone acetylation at specific genes played a role in their expression, but additional events are required for maintenance of differentiated gene expression and loss of the pluripotent state.

Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to a differentiation signal these cells are capable of multi-lineage differentiation into cells of the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm (2Gadue P. Huber T.L. Nostro M.C. Kattman S. Keller G.M. Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 955-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The term “commitment” is frequently used with regard to achieving a new differentiated phenotype, assayed by changes in morphology and patterns of gene expression (3Keller G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 4Loebel D.A. Watson C.M. De Young R.A. Tam P.P. Dev.

Commitment to the differentiated phenotype is probably a different, although not completely independent cellular process than loss of the undifferentiated state. The loss of the undifferentiated state occurs after exposure to a differentiation signal that results in an irreversible loss of the mES cell phenotype, characterized by loss of tight colony growth, altered self-renewal, and a pattern of marker gene expression that no longer resembles undifferentiated mES cells. We are interested in identifying the molecular events that regulate loss of the undifferentiated state of mES cells and commitment to lineage specific differentiation. Mouse ES cells are maintained in the undifferentiated state by adding leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to the culture media. A common method of inducing differentiation is withdrawal of LIF from the culture media, resulting in multi-lineage differentiation, indicated by the induced expression of lineage marker genes (6Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During early mES cell differentiation, the rate of transcription of large numbers of genes is substantially altered in a time-dependent fashion. Epigenetic changes are proposed to play a role in regulating both local and global gene expression through post-translational histone modifications (7Huebert D.J. Bernstein B.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Some histone modifications result in transcriptional activation, whereas others result in transcriptional repression (8Peterson C.L. Laniel M.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 546-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Some of these modifications appear to spread over broad genomic areas, resulting in large regional effects. In developmental models, covalent modifications of the histone tails have been proposed to act as epigenetic marks that impart transient or permanent “cellular memory” of the transcriptional activation state of specific genes or regions of the genome (9Turner B.M. Cell. 2002; 111: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 10Gil J. Bernard D. Peters G. DNA Cell Biol. 2005; 24: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Chromatin domains with both transcriptional activating and repressive histone tail modifications are seen in undifferentiated mES cells (11Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. Jaenisch R. Wagschal A. Feil R. Schreiber S.L. Lander E.S. Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). We propose that commitment and changes in transcription associated with very early differentiation of mES cells are at least in part regulated by local and/or global modifications of histone tails. We examined the role of acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in regulating the early events during differentiation of mES cells. In general, locally increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 is associated with increased gene transcription. Histone acetylation may increase transcription factor access to the DNA by relieving its interaction with the histone octomer, and high levels of acetylation can also disrupt higher order chromatin folding (12Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 13Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 14Verdone L. Caserta M. Di Mauro E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We observed a global increase in acetylation of histones H3 and H4 during the first 5 days of mES cell differentiation induced by LIF withdrawal. Examination of a set of marker genes showed that increased histone acetylation was not seen at all local sites. Rather, it occurred within the regulatory regions of specific genes and temporally correlated with the increase in transcription from each gene. We demonstrated that hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) induced a rapid morphologic and molecular (gene expression pattern) program that directly mimicked early differentiation induced by LIF withdrawal. Yet the TSA-treated cells were not committed to a differentiation pathway. Withdrawal of TSA resulted in a reversal to the undifferentiated cell phenotype. We conclude that global acetylation of histones H3 and H4 can induce the expression of some marker genes, but is not sufficient for early commitment to differentiation and loss of the pluripotent state. Cell Culture—CCE mES cells were used for all studies and were obtained from Dr. John Gearhart (Johns Hopkins University) with permission from Dr. Gordon Keller (15Robertson E. Bradley A. Kuehn M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Culture conditions were as previously described (6Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Preparation of Total RNA—RNA samples were isolated from cultured cells (usually one 10-cm plate/sample) using Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (6Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Conventional Reverse Transcription-PCR—The synthesis of cDNA and performance of conventional PCR was as previously reported (6Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additional primers used and detection are described in the supplemental data. Histone Purification—Cells (10-20 × 106) were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), scraped into PBS-PMSF, and centrifuged at 300 × g at 4 °C. Hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 mm sodium butyrate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) was added (0.5 ml), and the cells were centrifuged immediately at 300 × g. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer, allowed to swell for 10 min at 4 °C, and then homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with 10 strokes of a B pestle. The sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet-containing nuclei was resuspended in 0.2 m H2SO4 at about 2 mg of DNA/ml (about 400 μl), sonicated for 2-3 s at power setting 4, and allowed to stand at 4 °C overnight. This was sonicated again for 2-3 s at 4 °C and centrifuged at the maximum setting for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. One-third volume (133 μl) of 100% trichloroacetic acid (final, 25%) was added and mixed well, and proteins were allowed to precipitate for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The histone pellet was washed once with 1 ml of 100% acetone, 0.05 m HCl at 4 °C with vortexing and then centrifuged. The resulting pellet was washed once with 100% acetone at 4 °C and centrifuged. The pellet was allowed to air dry then resuspended in 200-800 μl of water at room temperature and stored at -80 °C. Total protein levels were determined using the BCA kit from Pierce. Histones were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and immunoblotted as described below. Immunofluorescence—Cells were harvested as a single cell suspension using trypsin followed by inactivation of the trypsin using growth media-containing serum. The cells were centrifuged onto slides using a Cytopro™ cytocentrifuge (Wescor) at 1400 rpm for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at RT. Cells were rinsed twice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 3% goat serum in 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS for 1 h at RT. Primary antibody at 1:400 dilution was applied in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h at RT in a humidity chamber. The slides were then rinsed 3 times with blocking agent for 2 min each at RT, and secondary antibody at 1:800 dilution was applied for 1 h at RT. The cells were counterstained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole at 1:50,000 dilution, and coverslips were applied using Fluoromount®. Primary antibodies include Oct3/4 (BD Transduction Laboratories) and Nestin clone Rat 401 (Stem Cell Technologies). Secondary antibody was Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Use of TSA—TSA (Sigma) was dissolved to 1 mm in 100% ethanol and used at 100 nm in 0.1% final ethanol concentration. Immunoblotting—Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunostained using standard methods. Primary antibodies were against acetylated histone H3 (Upstate), acetylated histone H4 (Upstate), native histone H3 (Upstate), and dimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (Upstate). Blotting for total histone H3 was used as a loading control. Appropriate conjugated secondary antibodies were used, and binding was detected by either enhanced chemiluminescence or chemifluorescence (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was performed as previously described with minor alterations as detailed in the supplemental data (17Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Curran E.M. Welshons W.V. Fritsch M.K. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 328: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed on DNA recovered from the immunoprecipitation and the total chromatin input. Primers used for PCR of genomic DNA recovered by ChIP for regulatory regions are shown in supplemental Table 1. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, stained with vistra green, and detected using the Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) with quantitation analysis performed using ImageQuant 5.2 software. Background signals for IgG or no antibody controls were subtracted from the immunoprecipitation numbers and generally represented less than 10-15% of the signal with specific antibody. The ratio of the corrected immunoprecipitation value over the total input value for the +LIF (undifferentiated mES cells) sample was arbitrarily set equal to one, and all other ratios were determined relative to this as a -fold acetylation relative to +LIF. For determination of the relative amount of acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at each promoter in the +LIF cells, the highest levels were always at the Oct4 regulatory region, and therefore, this was arbitrarily set equal to 100%, and all other values were expressed relative to this. Three independent experiments were performed, and the data were plotted as the mean ± S.E. Global Histone Acetylation Increased during Early Differentiation of mES Cells Induced by LIF Withdrawal—Total histones were prepared from undifferentiated mES cells maintained in the presence of LIF and from cells induced to differentiate by LIF withdrawal for 1-4 days. As shown in Fig. 1A, levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 increased over the 4 days of differentiation. The total pool of histone H4 showed an increase in global acetylation (a modification usually associated with localized transcriptional activation) beginning on day 2 after LIF withdrawal, reaching 2.5 on day 3 and persisting through day 4 (Fig. 1B). The level of acetylation of histone H3 also changed, but more slowly, and only achieved a modest 50% increase by day 4. The level of dimethylation on lysine 4 of histone H3 did not significantly change during this period. As shown in Fig. 1C, LIF withdrawal initiated a specific pattern of gene expression and order of induction and repression of marker genes over this time course. After 5 days of LIF withdrawal, this pattern of gene expression was quite dissimilar from the undifferentiated mES cells at day 0, providing a distinct fingerprint for early, multi-lineage differentiation. The gene expression pattern at 0 days of LIF withdrawal represented that of undifferentiated mES cells, with readily detectable transcripts for Oct4, Rex1, and Fgf4. This group of marker genes was termed “ON” to represent their expression in the pluripotent stem cell state. The transcript levels of all three of these genes decreased subsequent to LIF withdrawal but at different rates. The second set of marker genes, referred to here as “INDUCED,” were not expressed in the undifferentiated mES cell but displayed a time-dependent, ordered increase in their expression during LIF withdrawal. Transcripts for the PR increased first, within 1 day of LIF withdrawal, whereas levels for Hoxb1 (a patterning gene), Brachy (early mesoderm marker), and Nestin (early neural ectoderm marker) rose between days 2 and 3. The last set of genes, termed “OFF,” were not detectable during the early stages of differentiation examined in these studies. Afp (endoderm) and βH1 globin (later mesoderm) did not increase significantly until after 5 days of LIF withdrawal (6Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Prl and Ins are tissue-specific genes that were not expressed after LIF withdrawal in our model system even after longer induction times. Positive controls were performed on samples from cell lines expressing Prl and Ins (data not shown). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was expressed in undifferentiated cells, and RNA levels did not significantly change over this period. It was used as an internal control. Localized Histone Acetylation Patterns in Gene Regulatory Regions Correlated with Transcription and Not the Global Pattern—To determine whether changes in gene expression that occurred during early differentiation coincided with localized or global histone acetylation, we examined regulatory regions of the marker gene set during early differentiation using ChIP. We chose to examine regulatory regions, including promoters and enhancers, regardless of their location in the gene since increased histone acetylation in such regions is predicted to be permissive for transcription. Known regulatory regions of the marker gene set (diagrammed in Fig. 2) were amplified after immunoprecipitation of the chromatin with either anti-acetylated histone H3 or anti-acetylated histone H4 antibodies. Figs. 3, 4, and 5 show changes in levels of histone acetylation relative to the undifferentiated (+LIF, day 0) cells for the three gene sets: ON, INDUCED, and OFF. Fig. 3, A and B, show the relative acetylation of histones H3 and H4, respectively, in regulatory regions of the ON genes, which are expressed in undifferentiated mES cells but decrease over 5 days of differentiation (Figs. 1 and 6). The regulatory region of Oct4 demonstrated a small decrease in both histones H3 and H4 acetylation within 1 day of LIF withdrawal. Rex1 and Fgf4 showed a small decrease in histone H4 acetylation only. This loss of histone acetylation, although modest, was in contrast to the global increase in histone acetylation, which represented the average of all localized changes.FIGURE 3ChIP for acetylated histones H3 and H4 at the regulatory regions of the ON gene set as diagrammed in Fig. 2. The level of acetylated histones at times 4 h and 1, 2, 3, and 4 days of LIF withdrawal is expressed as a -fold change relative to that for undifferentiated mES cells (+LIF).

Histone acetylation in the regulatory regions shown in Fig. 2 was assayed by ChIP on undifferentiated mES cells. The level of histone acetylation at the Oct4 promoter was arbitrarily set equal to 100%, and the levels of acetylation of histone H3 (panel A) or histone H4 (panel B) are expressed as a percentage relative to the level of acetylation of the Oct4 promoter.

Local increases in histone acetylation over the differentiation time course were observed for all of these genes. PR is a complex gene, which we have recently shown is turned on in mES cells 12-24 h after LIF withdrawal (Fig. 1) (6Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of PR, PRA and PRB, are encoded by a single gene with two separate promoters (18Conneely O.M. Mulac-Jericevic B. DeMayo F. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2002; 57: 339-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The PRB promoter is upstream of the PRA promoter; therefore, the PRB transcript shares all the PRA sequence plus an additional 5′ sequence. The PCR primers we used in Fig. 1C did not distinguish between the two PR transcripts. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the PRB promoter demonstrated a 2-fold increase in histone H4 acetylation and a smaller increase in histone H3 acetylation as early as 4 h after LIF withdrawal. In contrast, acetylation of histone H4 at the PRA promoter showed a transient increase at 2 days and little change in acetylation of histone H3. The increased histone acetylation of PRB preceded the increase in PR transcripts observed at 12-24 h (6Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two known regulatory regions for the Hoxb1 gene, one in the 5′ promoter and the other in the 3′ region of the gene, were examined (19Huang D. Chen S.W. Gudas L.J. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 353-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histone H4 in the 3′ region increased by day 2, reaching 2-fold by day 4 of differentiation, with little change in histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 4, A and B). H4 acetylation of the 5′ region rose within 4 h and persisted to day 4 (Fig. 4, C and D). Acetylation of histone H3 also rapidly increased, reaching a 3.8-fold increase by day 4. The increase in histone H3 acetylation preceded the increased expression of Hoxb1 seen at 2-3 days (Figs. 1 and 6). As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 in the Nestin regulatory region increased 3 days after LIF withdrawal, coincident with increased gene expression. Acetylation of histone H3 in the Brachy regulatory region also increased 3 days after LIF withdrawal (Fig. 4C), coincident with increased accumulation of RNA (Fig. 1). Increased acetylation of histone H4 in this region was not visible until after 4 days (Fig. 4D). Overall, increased acetylation of either or both histones H3 and H4 was observed in at least one regulatory region of each INDUCED gene preceding or coincident with RNA accumulation. Fig. 5, A and B, show the relative acetylation of histones H3 and H4, respectively, in three regulatory regions of two genes, whose transcripts accumulate only after 5 days of LIF withdrawal (6Sauter C.N.

The β-globin gene locus is complex, containing multiple β-globin genes and regional as well as gene-specific regulatory regions. An upstream DNase hypersensitive site (locus control region HS2) is necessary for initial de-repression of the entire β-globin locus (20Bresnick E.H. Tze L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Development. 1991; 111: 259-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The local promoter of this gene (bH1) acquired a small, 1.5-fold increase in histone H3 acetylation after 3 days of LIF withdrawal, but little change in the level of H4 acetylation occurred over the 4 days (Fig. 5, A and B). The HS2 locus control region showed a unique pattern, with increased acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 only 4 h after LIF withdrawal followed by a return of acetylated histone H4 to the level seen in undifferentiated cells and a fall in acetylated histone H3 to 50% that seen in undifferentiated cells. This lower level was maintained throughout the 4 days of LIF withdrawal (Fig. 5A). The Afp regulatory region demonstrated an average 1.5-fold increase in the acetylation of histone H3 over the entire 4 days of LIF withdrawal and little change at H4 (Fig. 5, A and B). We have previously reported that both βH1 globin and Afp are expressed later in this cell model (6Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and these local increases in histone acetylation may be necessary to maintain these genes in a permissive chromatin structure during this early differentiation period. Finally, levels of histone acetylation were not altered in the regulatory regions of two genes (Ins and Prl) that were not expressed even at later times in this mES cell model (Fig. 5, C and D). Basal Acetylation of Histones H3 and H4 in Undifferentiated mES Cells Varied across the Regulatory Regions of the Marker Gene Set—We used ChIP to obtain a measure of the relative basal acetylation levels of the histone tails at the regulatory regions of the marker gene set in the undifferentiated mES cells as shown in Fig. 6. In all experiments the level of acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 was highest in the Oct4 regulatory region. We, therefore, arbitrarily set this to 100%, and levels in other regulatory regions are shown relative to the Oct4. The three genes of the ON set (Oct4, Rex1, Fgf4) showed some of the overall highest levels of acetylation of histones H3 (Fig. 6A) and H4 (Fig. 6B). The relative levels of histone acetylation in the regulatory regions of the rest of the marker gene set were quite variable. There was no apparent relationship between the level of histone acetylation in the undifferentiated state and the order of transcriptional activation that is seen in response to LIF withdrawal for the INDUCED set. This was indicated by the relatively high level of basal histone acetylation for Brachy despite having the slowest induced expression (as seen in Fig. 1). PRB, both Hoxb1 regulatory regions, and Nestin had lower basal acetylation of histones H3 and H4 than the ON set of genes yet were rapidly activated by LIF withdrawal. The basal acetylation of histones H3 and H4 for the “OFF” set of genes was also lower than for the ON set. Overall, integrating the results from Fig. 6 with Figs. 3, 4, and 5, differentiation induced the lar"

However, potent and specific urea transport blockers have not been available. Here, we used high-throughput screening to discover high-affinity, small molecule inhibitors of the UT-B urea transporter. A collection of 50,000 diverse, drug-like compounds was screened using a human erythrocyte lysis assay based on UT-B-facilitated acetamide transport. Primary screening yielded approximately 30 UT-B inhibitors belonging to the phenylsulfoxyoxazole, benzenesulfonanilide, phthalazinamine, and aminobenzimidazole chemical classes. Screening of approximately 700 structurally similar analogs gave many active compounds, the most potent of which inhibited UT-B urea transport with an EC50 of approximately 10 nM, and approximately 100% inhibition at higher concentrations. Phenylsulfoxyoxazoles and phthalazinamines also blocked rodent UT-B and had good UT-B vs. UT-A specificity. The UT-B inhibitors did not reduce aquaporin-1 (AQP1)-facilitated water transport. In AQP1-null erythrocytes, ""chemical UT-B knockout"" by UT-B inhibitors reduced by approximately 3-fold UT-B-mediated water transport, supporting an aqueous pore pathway through UT-B. UT-B inhibitors represent a new class of diuretics, ""urearetics,"" which are predicted to increase renal water and solute clearance in water-retaining states."
https://openalex.org/W2167390304,"Binding of pathogen-bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) to cell surface Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) triggers a wide variety of effector functions. The binding kinetics and affinities of IgG-FcγR interactions are hence important parameters for understanding FcγR-mediated immune functions. We have measured the kinetic rates and equilibrium dissociation constants of IgG binding to a soluble FcγRIIIa fused with Ig Fc (sCD16a) using the surface plasmon resonance technique. sCD16a interacted with monomeric human IgG and its subtypes IgG1 and IgG3 as well as rabbit IgG with on-rates of 6.5 × 103, 8.2 × 103, 1.1 × 104 and 1.8 × 104 m–1 s–1, off-rates of 4.7 × 10–3, 5.7 × 10–3, 5.9 × 10–3, and 1.9 × 10–2 s–1, and equilibrium dissociation constants of 0.72, 0.71, 0.56, and 1.1 μm, respectively. The kinetics and affinities measured by surface plasmon resonance agreed with those obtained from real time flow cytometry and competition inhibition binding experiments using cell surface CD16a. These data add to our understanding of IgG-FcγR interactions. Binding of pathogen-bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) to cell surface Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) triggers a wide variety of effector functions.

The kinetics and affinities measured by surface plasmon resonance agreed with those obtained from real time flow cytometry and competition inhibition binding experiments using cell surface CD16a. These data add to our understanding of IgG-FcγR interactions. Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) 7The abbreviations used are: FcγR, Fc γ receptor; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; IgG, immunoglobulin G; h, human; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NA1 and NA2, neutrophil antigen 1 and 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Rb, rabbit; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; TM, transmembrane. are a family of cell surface glycoproteins with varying affinities for the Fc region of immunoglobulins G (IgG). Three classes of human FcγRs have been described: FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), and FcγRIII (CD16), which are widely distributed in hematopoietic cell lineages. These include at least 12 different isoforms many of which are polymorphic. For example, CD16 has two isoforms, a and b, that differ by six amino acids in the extracellular domain and the presence (CD16a) or absence (CD16b) of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (1van de Winkel J.G.J. Capel P.J.A. Human IgG Fc receptors. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). The IgG-FcγR interaction-mediated binding of antibody-opsonized pathogens to leukocytes is a key event by which antibody effector functions are initiated. Kinetic rates and binding affinity are critical determinants of an IgG-FcγR interaction, as they control how likely and how rapidly such binding will occur, how many bonds will be formed, and how long the bonds last. In addition, it has been hypothesized that these parameters are related to the signaling events following the initial binding (2Matsui K. Boniface J.J. Steffner P. Reay P.A. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12862-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 3McKeithan T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using a micropipette method, we have measured the kinetic rates and binding affinities of several IgG-FcγR interactions when both interacting molecules are anchored on apposing surfaces. We found that in this assay the half-lives of these IgG-FcγR bonds are in the order of seconds (5Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys.

In addition to interaction parameters of surface-linked molecules, the kinetic rates and affinities of FcγRs for soluble IgG are also of interest, because in vivo interactions of immobilized IgG to leukocyte FcγRs are subject to competitive binding of soluble antibodies in sera. Of the three FcγRs, CD64 binds to monomeric IgG with high affinity (Kd ∼ tens of nm) (10Miller K.L. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2227-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), CD32 and CD16b are of low affinities (Kd, several and several tens of μm, respectively) (6Chesla S.E. Li P. Nagarajan S.

In addition to the above results, which were obtained by conventional assays using FcγR-expressing cells, there were two studies using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology and soluble FcγRs. Galon et al. (13Galon J. Robertson M.W. Galinha A. Mazieres N. Spagnoli R. Fridman W.H. Sautes C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1928-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported half-lives of the order of 10 min and equilibrium dissociation constants of several micromolar for sCD16bNA2 binding to human (h) IgG1 and IgG3. By comparison, Maenaka et al. (14Maenaka K. van der Merwe P.A. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Sondermann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44898-44904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) found a much faster off-rate (half-lives of the order of seconds) but similar Kd for IgG-sCD16bNA2 binding. Here, we report kinetic and affinity measurements of a soluble dimeric human FcγRIIIa (sCD16a) interacting with various IgG ligands in both monomeric and multimeric forms using SPR. We found that sCD16a interacted with monomeric rabbit (Rb) IgG, hIgG, hIgG1, and hIgG3 with on-rates of 1.8 × 104, 6.5 × 103, 8.2 × 103, and 1.1 × 104 m–1 s–1, off-rates of 1.9 × 10–2, 4.7 × 10–3, 5.7 × 10–3, and 5.9 × 10–3 s–1, and equilibrium dissociation constants of 1.1, 0.72, 0.71, and 0.56 μm, respectively. sCD16a bound with aggregated ligands with lower apparent equilibrium dissociation constants and slower apparent off-rates. To ensure that the relatively slow kinetics is not artifactual, various controls were performed in both the experiment and analysis steps. The slow kinetics was not found to be artifacts because of the mass transport limitation, ligand aggregation, or dimeric binding of the sCD16a molecule. The kinetic rates and affinities were also measured by real-time flow cytometry and a competition inhibition binding experiment using CD16 expressed on the cell surface, which were found to be in agreement with those obtained by SPR. Cells, Soluble CD16a, and Antibodies—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected to express human CD16a™, CD16bNA1, CD16bNA2, and B7-1GPI as well as untransfected CHO cells were cultured as previously described (15Nagarajan S.

The mutated IgG1 CH2-CH3 Fc domains were obtained from Dr. Peter Linsley, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, as the hB7-1-Ig construct and the extracellular domain of hCD16a was cloned in the place of hB7-1 as described (17Li P. Nagarajan S. Zhu C. Selvaraj P. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Fc domain of hCD16a-Ig are L267F, L268E, G270A, and A363T (numbered as in accession number AAH69020.1). These mutations were shown to abolish the binding of FcγRs (18Chappel M.S.

The anti-CD16 nonblocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) 214.1 (murine IgG1) was a generous gift from Dr. Howard Fleit (State University of New York, Long Island). The anti-CD16 adhesion blockade mAb CLBFcgran-1 (murine IgG2a) was purified in house from hybridomas as previously described (20Selvaraj P. Rosse W.F. Silber R. Springer T.A. Nature. 1988; 333: 565-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Cleavage of CLBFcgran-1 into Fab fragments was done by Lampire (Pipersville, PA). The rabbit anti-mouse Fc polyclonal antibody was purchased from BIAcore (Piscataway, NJ). Total hIgG and subtypes (hIgG1, hIgG2, and hIgG3) as well as RbIgG were purchased from Sigma, except hIgG1 used for the real time flow cytometry experiment, which was a generous gift from Dr. Adrian Whitty (Biogen Inc., Boston, MA). Fab of CLBFcgran-1 and hIgG1 was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Monomeric and multimeric IgG ligands were separated by size exclusion chromatography. 7.5 g of Sephadex G-200 (Amersham Biosciences) was swelled in 200 ml of PBS/EDTA (containing 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 90 °C for 5 h and then cooled at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was decanted and the gel was resuspended in 150 ml of PBS/EDTA and poured into a column. Two columns were used, with respective diameters of 1.7 and 1.0 cm and respective volumes of 150 and 103 ml (Bio-Rad). The columns were rinsed with 300 ml of PBS/EDTA at 0.3 ml/min between each run. Two sets of gel filtration standards were used to calibrate the columns. The first set included 4 mg each in 1 ml of PBS/EDTA of cytochrome c (molecular mass 12 kDa), blue dextran (2,000 kDa), and BSA (88 kDa) (Sigma). The second set included 2.5 mg of thyroglobulin (670 kDa), 2.5 mg of bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), 2.5 mg of chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), 1.25 mg of equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and 0.25 mg of vitamin B12 (1.4 kDa). After adding 5–20 mg of IgG in 1 ml of PBS/EDTA, the column was connected to a 1-liter reservoir of PBS/EDTA. Setting the flow rate at 0.25–0.75 ml/min, the effluent was collected sequentially in fractions of 1.5 ml each. The optical density at 280 nm was measured to monitor the protein concentration in each fraction. Monomeric or multimeric IgG fractions were used immediately after separation, either directly or further diluted to lower concentrations for SPR or real time flow cytometry experiments. In some cases where higher concentrations were desired, chromatographed IgG was reconcentrated by using protein concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrations of monomeric and multimeric IgG were determined by a protein estimation kit (Bio-Rad). SPR Measurement—SPR experiments were conducted in a BIAcore™ 1000 instrument using CM5 sensor chips (BIAcore) at 25 °C. Samples were prepared in PBS/EDTA and perfused over the sensor chip at 30 μl/min (unless otherwise stated) for kinetic measurements. For other control experiments, the flow rate was 5 μl/min. The running buffer was BIA-certified HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant p20) filtered and degassed using 0.2-μm bottle top filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Several approaches were tried in preliminary experiments to immobilize sCD16a on the sensor chip, including the standard amine coupling procedure to coat either sCD16a directly or a nonblocking anti-CD16 mAb 214.1, which in turn captured sCD16a. Unfortunately, the former adversely affected the ability of sCD16a to bind ligands and the latter did not allow satisfactory regeneration of the sensor chip. The approach that worked best with our reagents appeared to be coupling first a rabbit anti-mouse Fc antibody to the sensor chip with the amine coupling procedure then binding mAb 214.1, followed by capturing sCD16a. This approach also ensured the consistent orientation of the sCD16a molecule on the sensor chip. The sensor chip could be regenerated with three washes of 10 μlof 1 m formic acid (Sigma), which completely removed noncovalently bound sCD16a and 214.1 without impairing the reactivity of the anti-mouse Fc antibody. The binding of mAb 214.1 was ≥95% of the initial level after 40 times of regeneration. Using the full rabbit anti-mouse Fc antibody yielded negligible sCD16a binding to its Fc region, as confirmed by a control experiment in which sCD16a was injected over the sensor chip coupled with the full rabbit anti-mouse Fc antibody alone without mAb 214.1 followed by subsequent injection of IgG ligands. The kinetic rates of IgG-sCD16a binding were derived by globally fitting the Langmuir (1:1) model (cf. Equations 1 and 2) to the family of association and dissociation curves collected at different ligand concentrations, using BIAevaluation 3.0 software provided by the manufacturer. The affinity of CLBFcgran-1 Fab-sCD16a binding was derived by Scatchard analysis. Kinetic Measurement of Cell Surface CD16 by Real Time Flow Cytometry—5 × 106 cells were washed three times in 5 ml of binding buffer (RPMI, 1% IgG-free BSA, 0.02% sodium azide). Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer and transferred to a tube. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled ligands in binding buffer were added and quickly mixed with the cells to obtain 2.5 × 106 cells/ml cell concentration and the desired final ligand concentration. A range of ligand concentrations was selected based on separate affinity measurements using other techniques, such that the receptors could be saturated at high concentrations yet the ligands would not be depleted in low concentrations. To assay for association, the sample was immediately run in a FACS Vantage machine (BD Biosciences) and a total of 15 fluorescence intensity histograms were measured sequentially in predetermined time points over a 12-min period. The earliest time point a histogram could be measured was ∼10 s. Each histogram included >2,000 events and took ∼2 s to acquire. The sample was vortexed between two consecutive time points to ensure cells and ligands were well mixed. The right-shift of the histogram toward higher fluorescence intensity was monitored in real time. To assay for dissociation, the remaining sample from the association assay was incubated for another 20 min to ensure equilibrium was achieved. 1 ml of the sample was centrifuged, the supernatant was decanted, and the tube was vortexed to disperse the cell pellet. 2 ml of plain medium was added to resuspend the cells. The sample was immediately run in the FACS machine to measure another 15 fluorescence intensity histograms sequentially in predetermined time points over a 12-min period. The background-subtracted mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) versus time data of the association and dissociation assays were, respectively, fit to equations, C=konLRTkonL+koff{1−exp[−(konL+Koff)t]} (Eq. 1) and C=ηkonLRTkonL+koffexp(−kofft) (Eq. 2) where kon and koff are the respective on- and off-rates and t is time. The concentration of bound ligands C is proportional to the measured MFI. Neglecting depletion due to binding, the free ligand concentration L is assumed to be the same as that added to the reaction mixture. RT is the concentration of total receptors. The proportionality constant η accounts for the difference between the equilibrium MFI from the association assay and the initial MFI from the dissociation assay. The standard free energy of binding, ΔG° (kcal mol–1), was calculated from the Kd measured at various temperatures, ΔG° = RTln(Kd), where R is the universal gas constant (1.987 × 10–3 kcal mol–1 K–1), T is the absolute temperature, and Kd is expressed as mole liter–1. Affinity Measurement for Cell Surface CD16—The affinities of CLBFcgran-1 Fab for CHO cell CD16a™, CD16bNA1, and CD16bNA2 were determined by Scatchard analysis. The affinities of monomeric IgG to CD16 were measured by a competitive inhibition binding assay as previously described (6Chesla S.E. Li P. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10235-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells were grown in flasks until near confluence. Cells were rinsed once in PBS and then removed from the flask using PBS/EDTA. After washing, they were resuspended at 106 cells/ml in PBS/EDTA and added to V-bottom 96-well plates at 100 μl/well. The wells were precoated with 1% IgG-free BSA (Sigma) in PBS by incubating at room temperature for 2 h. They were rinsed with PBS/EDTA and kept on ice until the cells were added. After adding cells, the plates were spun at 2000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was removed and 50 μl of IgG in PBS/EDTA at the titrated concentrations were added to each well with mixing. Then, 50 μlof 125I-CLBFcgran-1 Fab in PBS/EDTA at a concentration of 0.25–0.50 μg/ml was added to each well, followed by a 45-min incubation on a shaker at 5 °C. After washing 3 times, the cell pellets were removed and counted in a γ counter. In the presence of increasing concentrations of the low affinity ligand (IgG, concentration cll), the binding of the high affinity ligand (125I-CLBFcgran-1 Fab, concentration chl) to the cell surface receptor (CD16) is gradually reduced, or displaced. The displaced fraction, defined as the bound fraction (f) of CLBF-cgran-1 normalized by the value when no IgG was present (f0), can be expressed by Equation 3. f/f0=[cr+crh+(cllKal+1)/Kal]/2cr−{[cr+clh+(cllKal+1)/Kal]2−4crclh}1/2/2cr (Eq. 3) Because the affinity to CD16 of 125I-CLBFcgran-1 Fab (Kah) and the receptor concentration (cr) were predetermined from a separate experiment by Scatchard analysis, the only unknown in Equation 3 is the affinity of IgG (Kal). Therefore, (Kal) can be calculated from a single measurement of F without the experimental displacement curve to include data at the IC50 point. To increase the accuracy of the (Kal) value, however, the predicted displaced fraction (Equation 3) was nonlinearly fit to the entire f/f0 versus cll data set. Demonstration of Binding Specificity—As shown in Fig. 1, monomeric hIgG did not bind to a CM5 chip surface only coated with rabbit anti-mouse Fc antibody and mAb 214.1. However, after further functionalization with sCD16a, a similar injection of monomeric hIgG resulted in a time-dependent binding of 370 resonance units in 150 s. Switching the perfusate from hIgG solution to plain buffer resulted in dissociation of the bound hIgG. The chip was regenerated by washing off the 214.1-sCD16a-HIgG complex with three injections of 1 m formic acid at 2 min each, and then re-capturing mAb 214.1 and sCD16a. Binding resulted when the saturating concentration of CLBFcgran-1 Fab (anti-CD16 blocking mAb) was injected; however, subsequent injection of monomeric hIgG did not yield further binding (not shown), indicating nearly complete blockade of the sCD16a sites for hIgG binding. These results indicate that the binding of hIgG to the surface coated with sCD16a was mediated by the specific hIgG-sCD16a interaction. Separation of Monomeric and Multimeric IgG—The presence of multimers in commercial IgG even after high speed centrifugation was revealed by size exclusion chromatography as exemplified in Fig. 2A for RbIgG. Results for hIgG, hIgG1, and hIgG3 were similar (data not shown). The first peak, which appeared at fraction 28, was eluted at nearly the same time as the peak fraction of blue dextran (indicated by arrow). Blue dextran has a molecular mass (2,000 kDa) much higher than that of monomeric IgG (∼150 kDa) and was excluded by Sephadex G-200. This suggests that the first peak represents multimeric RbIgG. A second peak of RbIgG, which appeared at fraction 40, was eluted before BSA (peaked at fraction 51). The relative elution volumes (Ve/Vo) of cytochrome c, BSA, and IgG (2nd peak, assumed to be monomeric) are plotted against their molecular weights in Fig. 2B and compared with published results (21Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). Good agreement is seen between our data and those of Andrews (21Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar), indicating that the second IgG peak in Fig. 2A indeed represents monomers. The small difference in the relative volume of cytochrome c between the results of Andrews (21Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar) and ours may be attributed to the difference in how long the column had been used, which was noted to influence the relative position of low molecular weight protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, the multimeric RbIgG comprised a significant fraction of RbIgG from the commercial source, which would have adversely affected the SPR measurement if not removed. To determine whether the chromatographed IgG would form aggregates in experiments where reconcentrated IgG was used, the monomeric RbIgG fractions were pooled, reconcentrated to 5 mg/ml, and passed through the column again in the time scale of SPR experiments. It is evident from Fig. 2A that only a single, symmetric peak of monomeric IgG was seen, apparently free of any detectable multimers. This suggests that re-aggregation of IgG is a relatively slow process and did not occur under our experimental conditions, which is consistent with a previous report (12Vance B.A. Huizinga T.W. Wardwell K. Guyre P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6429-6439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetics of Monomeric IgG-sCD16a Interactions—Monomeric IgG solutions of increasing concentrations were perfused over the sCD16a-derivitized sensor chip and the interaction time courses were measured, as exemplified in Fig. 3. It can be seen that both the association and dissociation were relatively slow, requiring a few minutes to achieve equilibrium or reach half-dissociation. It is also apparent that RbIgG bound to and dissociated from sCD16a faster than human IgGs. sCD16a was immobilized to the sensor chip via a nonblocking anti-CD16 mAb 214.1, which in turn was captured by a rabbit anti-mouse Fc antibody. Although at rates much slower than those of IgG ligands dissociating from sCD16a, sCD6a and 214.1 also dissociated from their respective capturing antibodies over time, manifested as a negatively drifting baseline. To correct for this effect, the curve resulting from an injection of plain buffer alone, in which the slow dissociation of 214.1 and sCD16a was monitored, was subtracted from all the measured binding curves. The refraction index difference between protein samples and the running buffer, manifested as an instantaneous resonance unit change, was also determined in a control experiment (on the same rabbit anti-mouse Fc antibody-coated chip but without sCD16a immobilization) and subtracted from raw data in all sensorgrams presented here. A Langmuir (1:1) model was fit simultaneously to the entire family of data curves in both association and dissociation phases. Such a global fitting procedure accentuates deviation at any one concentration but ensures more robust kinetic constants overall (22Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 268-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The kinetic rates so evaluated are summarized in Table 1; and the model predictions based on these parameters are exemplified in Fig. 4 along with the data. It can be seen that the model fits both the association and dissociation data of the hIgG-sCD16a interaction reasonably well. Similarly good fits were obtained for the hIgG1- and RbIgG-sCD16a interactions (data not shown). By comparison, the fit for the hIgG3-sCD16a interaction is not as good (data not shown). Despite its low concentration in serum (23Allansmith M. McClellan B.H. Butterworth M. Maloney J.R. J. Pediatr. 1968; 72: 276-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), hIgG3 is known to comprise at least 12 allotypes (24Propert D. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1995; 12: 198-205PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, no attempt was made to further separate the various hIgG3 allotypes from the purchased heterogeneous mixture, which, we believe, is the reason why the homogeneous Langmuir model does not fit the hIgG3-sCD16a interaction data well.TABLE 1Kinetic rates and equilibrium dissociation constants of sCD16a for IgG measured by SPRLigandkonkoffKd103 m-1 s-110-3 s-1μmMonomerichIgG (n = 6)6.51 ± 0.264.71 ± 0.240.72 ± 0.02hIgG1 (n = 4)8.18 ± 0.285.74 ± 0.360.71 ± 0.04hIgG3 (n = 4)10.64 ± 1.345.89 ± 0.330.56 ± 0.09RbIgG (n = 5)17.62 ± 3.7518.6 ± 2.521.07 ± 0.16MultimerichIgG (n = 3)12.67 ± 0.931.98 ± 0.140.16 ± 0.02hIgG1 (n = 3)15.59 ± 1.131.19 ± 0.020.077 ± 0.006hIgG3 (n = 3)13.19 ± 0.240.67 ± 0.020.051 ± 0.001RbIgG (n = 3)9.27 ± 0.151.03 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab Kinetics of Multimeric IgG-sCD16a Interactions—Compared with monomers, multimeric IgG dissociated from sCD16a much more slowly and required much lower concentrations to achieve the same level of binding, indicating a much higher avidity (Fig. 5). For the purpose of comparing our results with data in the literature, the same Langmuir model was used to fit the association and dissociation curves of IgG multimers. The kinetic mechanism for binding of multimeric ligands must not be 1:1; as such, a more involved model is needed to extract the intrinsic kinetic constants. Fitting the simple Langmuir model to the multimeric ligand binding data returns the apparent rates of a surrogate monomeric ligand whose kinetics would generate approximately the same time courses as the multimeric ligand. The apparent on- and off-rates so obtained nevertheless reveal the much higher binding capacities of the IgG multimers than those of the IgG monomers. The apparent rates obtained from the multimeric ligand experiments are listed in Table 1. Affinity of mAb CLBFcgran-1 Fab-sCD16a Interactions—It should be instructive to compare receptor-ligand and antibody-antigen interactions. CLBFcgran-1 Fab solutions at various concentrations were perfused over a sCD16a-derivitized surface. It is evident from Fig. 6A that CLBFcgran-1 Fab bound sCD16a with a much higher affinity and a much slower off-rate than any of the sCD16a ligands tested. Antibody typically binds to antigen with a rather high onrate. In such a case mass transfer may be the limiting step (4van der Merwe P.A. Bodian D.L. Daenke S. Linsley P. Davis S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar); fitting a transient model to the association and dissociation time courses would likely yield erroneous results. To circumvent this problem, Scatchard analysis (Fig. 6B) was used to derive the binding affinity of CLBFcgran-1 Fab for sCD16a. The estimated equilibrium dissociation constant is in the order of nanomolar (Table 2). In comparison, the Kd values for IgG-sCD16a interactions are in the order of micromolar.TABLE 2Equilibrium dissociation constants of monomeric IgG ligands and mAb to sCD16a measured by SPR as well as to CHO cell CD16 isoforms measured by Scatchard plot and competitive inhibitionsCD16aCD16atmCD16bna1CD16bna2RIgG (μm)1.07 ± 0.16 (n = 5)1.86 ± 0.19 (n = 3)29.9 ± 3.2 (n = 3)36.4 ± 12.4 (n = 3)hIgG (μm)0.72 ± 0.02 (n = 6)1.37 ± 0.30 (n = 3)31.1 ± 9.5 (n = 3)53.0 ± 11.0 (n = 3)CLBFcgran-1 Fab (nm)2.37 ± 0.07 (n = 2)4.59 ± 0.09 (n = 2)6.46 ± 0.76 (n = 2)12.1 ± 4.9 (n = 2) Open table in a new tab The sCD16a-IgG Binding Kinetics Were Not Affected by the Injection Time—The presence of a significant amount of multimers in the chromatographed IgG could give rise to a multiexponential appearance in both association and dissociation sensorgrams. Such a diagnostic feature was not observed (e.g. Fig. 3). However, this effect could be amplified by the long injection time because multimeric ligands would continue to bind the receptors after the binding of monomeric ligands had achieved equilibrium (25van der Merwe P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2019282328,"CXCL8 (interleukin-8) interacts with two receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, to activate leukocytes. Upon activation, CXCR2 internalizes very rapidly relative to CXCR1 (∼90% versus ∼10% after 5 min). The C termini of the receptors have been shown to be necessary for internalization but are not sufficient to explain the distinct kinetics of down-regulation. To determine the structural determinant(s) that modulate receptor internalization, various chimeric and point mutant receptors were generated by progressively exchanging specific domains or amino acids between CXCR1 and CXCR2. The receptors were stably expressed in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells and characterized for receptor binding, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, phosphorylation, internalization, and MAPK activation. The data herein indicate that the second extracellular loop (2ECL) of the receptors is critical for the distinct rate of internalization. Replacing the 2ECL of CXCR2 with that of CXCR1 (B2ECLA) or Asp199 with its CXCR1 valine counterpart (BD199VA) delayed CXCR2 internalization similarly to CXCR1. Replacing Asp199 with Asn (BD199N) restored CXCR2 rapid internalization. Structure modeling of the 2ECL of the receptors also suggested that Asp199 plays a critical role in stabilizing and modulating CXCR2 rapid internalization relative to CXCR1. BD199N internalized rapidly but migrated as a single phosphorylated form like CXCR1 (∼75 kDa), whereas B2ECLA and BD199VA showed slow and fast migrating forms like CXCR2 (∼45 and ∼65 kDa, respectively) but internalized like CXCR1. These data further undermine the role of receptor oligomerization in CXCL8 receptor internalization. Like CXCR1, BD199VA also induced sustained ERK activation and cross-desensitized Ca2+ mobilization to CCR5 relative to BD199N and CXCR2. Altogether, the data suggest that the 2ECL of the CXCL8 receptors is important in modulating their distinct rate of down-regulation and thereby signal length and post-internalization activities.

Chemokines are a family of structurally related peptides that regulate inflammation through cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors on leukocytes. These peptides mediate diverse biological and biochemical activities, including endothelial adhesion, directed migration, and activation of cytotoxic activities such as the respiratory burst and exocytosis (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar, 2Locati M. Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Chemokines have been classified into four families (C, CC, CXC, and CX3C) based on the number and positions of the N-terminally conserved cysteine residues. Most chemokines activate more than one chemokine receptor, and many chemokine receptors are activated by multiple chemokines (3Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar). CXCL8 activates two receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. CXCR1 is specific for CXCL8, whereas CXCR2 also interacts with CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, and CXCL7 (4Baggiolini M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Upon activation, both receptors couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein to mediate phosphoinositide (PI) 2The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphoinositide; TMD, transmembrane domain; ECL, extracellular loop; WT, wild-type; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. hydrolysis, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, chemotaxis, and exocytosis. CXCR1 (but not CXCR2) activates phospholipase D and mediates respiratory burst, suggesting that the two receptors may play different physiological roles (5L'Heureux G.P. Bourgoin S. Jean N.

A. 1996; 93: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Like many G protein-coupled receptors, both receptors become phosphorylated, desensitized, and internalized upon exposure to CXCL8. Over 95% of CXCR2 internalizes in the first 2-5 min of activation compared with ∼10% of CXCR1 (7Barlic J. Khandaker M.H. Mahon E. Andrews J. DeVries M.E. Mitchell G.B. Rahimpour R. Tan C.M.

This difference in receptor trafficking appears to be an important factor in the distinct ability of CXCR1 and CXCR2 to mediate leukocyte activation and regulation in response to CXCL8 (9Richardson R.M.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 2904-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To date, the molecular basis for the differential regulation of the CXCL8 receptors remains unclear. CXCR1 and CXCR2 are highly homologous (77%) (15Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 16Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The most divergent regions are the N terminus, the fourth transmembrane domain (TMD), the second extracellular loop (ECL), and the C terminus (15Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I.

Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although both receptors internalize via a phosphorylation/arrestin/dynamin-dependent mechanism, CXCR2 has been also shown to internalize via a phosphorylation-independent mechanism (19Fan G.H. Yang W. Sai J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16960-16968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This partial internalization of the receptors requires the interaction of the C-terminal dileucine motif LLKIL with scaffold proteins such as AP-2 (adaptor protein-2) (20Fan G.H. Yang W. Wang X.J. Qian Q. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A previous study using phosphorylation-deficient and C-terminal deletion mutants of CXCR1 and CXCR2 indicates that the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors are necessary for receptor phosphorylation and subsequent arrestin binding but are not sufficient to account for the differences in receptor internalization and recycling (10Richardson R.M. Marjoram R.J. Barak L.S. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2904-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recent studies in our laboratory (10Richardson R.M. Marjoram R.J. Barak L.S.

This suggests that domains other than the C termini modulate the rates of CXCR1 and CXCR2 trafficking in response to CXCL8. In this work, we sought to determine the structural determinants of CXCR2 involved in rapid receptor internalization relative to CXCR1. To this end, chimeric and point mutant receptors with different regions or specific amino acids of CXCR2 replaced with their CXCR1 counterparts were generated and expressed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) 2H3 cells. The receptors were characterized for their pharmacological and physiological properties as well as their ability to undergo receptor internalization, phosphorylation, and desensitization in response to CXCL8 occupancy. The data herein indicate that the 2ECL of CXCR2 is critical for its rapid internalization relative to CXCR1. Point mutants and computational modeling studies further identified Asp199 of the 2ECL as a key modulator of CXCR2 rapid internalization. Materials—[32P]Orthophosphate (8500-9120 Ci/mmol), myo[2-3H]inositol (24.4 Ci/mmol), and 125I-labeled CXCL8 were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. CXCL8/interleukin-8 was prepared as described previously (23Rajagopalan L. Rajarathnam K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30000-30008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Growth-regulated oncogene-α (CXCL1) was purchased from Pepro-Tech. Geneticin (G418) and all tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibody 12CA5, protein G-agarose, and protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Anti-human interleukin-8 receptor A (CXCR1) and interleukin-8 receptor B (CXCR2) antibodies were purchased from PharMigen. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents are from commercial sources. cDNAs encoding the chimeric mutants AB1, BA1, ABA, and BAB were generous gifts from Dr. Philip M. Murphy (National Institutes of Health). “A” refers to CXCR1, and “B” refers CXCR2. To facilitate the interpretation of the data, A and B were also employed throughout this work to designate the chimeric and point mutant receptors. The chimeras were excised from pCEP4 using NotI and XhoI and subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3. Construction of Chimeric and Point Mutants of CXCR1 and CXCR2—The CXCR1 and CXCR2 cDNAs possess a unique conserved BamHI restriction site located at the junction of the second ECL (2ECL) and 5TMD. This site is also conserved in chimeric mutants ABA and BAB and was used to generate the chimeric receptors (17Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A4TMDB and B4TMDA were generated by PCR using ABA and BAB as templates, T7 pcDNA3 as the forward primer, and two reverse primers corresponding to the 2ECL of CXCR1 (A2ECL;5′-GGGCAGGATCCGTAACACCATCCGCCATTTTGCTGTGTCGTTGCCCAGGACCTCATAGCAAACTGGGCTGGAATTGTTTGGATGGACGGTCCTTCG-3′) and that of CXCR2 (B2ECL;5′-AGGCAGGATCCGCAACAGCATCCGCCAGTTTGCTGTATTATTTCCCATGTCCTCATAGCAGGCTGGACTAACATTGGATGAGTAGTAAGCCTGGCG-3′). The BamHI site is underlined. For the generation of A2ECLB and B2ECLA, the same reverse primers were employed using CXCR1 (B2ECL) and CXCR2 (A2ECL) as templates, respectively. The resulting PCR products were digested with NotI and BamHI and ligated into pcDNA3-CXCR1 (A4TMDB and A2ECLB) or pcDNA3-CXCR2 (B4TMDA and B2ECLA) digested with the same restriction enzymes. Point mutations were introduced into pcDNA3-CXCR1 or pcDNA3-CXCR2 constructs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forward and reverse primers were designed with single base changes to incorporate amino acid point mutations. The identity of all chimeric and point mutant constructs and the fidelity of all PCR-based coding sequences were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (24Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells (1 × 107) were transfected by electroporation with 20 μg of pcDNA3 containing the receptor cDNAs, and Geneticin-resistant cells were cloned into single cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. The levels of protein expression were monitored by FACS analysis. FACS Analysis—For flow cytometric analysis, RBL cells were detached by EDTA treatment, washed with HEPES-buffered Hanks’ balanced salt solution, and resuspended in the same medium. Cells (1-5 × 106) were incubated with anti-CXCR1 or anti-CXCR2 antibody (1 μg/ml) in a total volume of 400 μl of HEPES-buffered Hanks’ balanced salt solution for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed again and analyzed for cell-surface expression of the receptor on a BD Biosciences FACScan cytometer (10Richardson R.M. Marjoram R.J. Barak L.S. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2904-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Radioligand Binding Assays and Receptor Internalization—Radioligand binding assays were carried out as described previously (10Richardson R.M. Marjoram R.J. Barak L.S. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2904-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured overnight in 24-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) in growth medium. Cells were then rinsed with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated on ice for 2-4 h in the same medium (250 μl) containing 125I-labeled CXCL8 (0.1-1 nm). Reactions were stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and washed three times with the same buffer. The cells were then solubilized with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (200 μl) and dried under vacuum, and bound radioactivity was counted (25Richardson R.M. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9201-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Bound nonspecific radioactivity was determined in the presence of 500 nm unlabeled CXCL8. Kd and Bmax values were determined by GraphPad radioligand binding data analysis. For receptor internalization, cells were incubated with ligand for 0-60 min at 37 °C and washed with ice-cold PBS, and 125I-labeled CXCL8 (0.1-1 nm) binding was carried out as described above. PI Hydrolysis and Calcium Measurement—RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured overnight in 96-well culture plates (50,000 cells/well) in inositol-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. Cells were then washed with HEPES-buffered saline supplemented with 100 mm LiCl2 in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin and preincubated with 50 μl of the same buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm CXCL8 or CXCL1. Reactions were terminated 10 min later by addition of 200 μl of chloroform, methanol, and 4 n HCl (100:200:2); 75 μl of 0.1 n HCl; and 75 μl of chloroform. Total [3H]inositol phosphates in the aqueous phase were separated on columns of Dowex formate (24Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

For calcium mobilization, cells (5 × 106) were washed with HEPES-buffered saline and loaded with 1 μm indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester in the presence of 1 μm pluronic acid for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with HEPES and resuspended in 1.5 ml of Siraganian buffer. Intracellular calcium increase in the presence or absence of ligands was measured as described previously (27Nasser M.W. Marjoram R.J. Brown S.L. Richardson R.M. J.

The labeled cells were then stimulated with the indicated ligands for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against the N terminus of either CXCR1 or CXCR2, analyzed by SDS electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. ERK Activity—For ERK activity, RBL-2H3 cells (5 × 106) expressing the receptors were washed three times with PBS and then resuspended in PBS containing CXCL8 (100 nm) for different periods of time at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped with ice-cold PBS; cells were collected by centrifugation; and membranes were prepared and assayed for protein concentration as described previously (28Brown S.L. Jala V.R. Raghuwanshi S.K. Nasser M.W. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3242-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (∼50 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibody against either ERK1/2 or phospho-ERK1/2 (28Brown S.L. Jala V.R. Raghuwanshi S.K. Nasser M.W. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3242-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Detection was carried out with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody and by ECL. Homology Modeling of Human CXCR2—Multiple sequence alignment of rhodopsin and human CXCR2 along with human CXCR1 was performed using ClustalW (align.genome.jp) using the BLO-SUM matrix. To prohibit any gap within the TMD core, a gap open penalty of 15.0 and a gap extension penalty of 0.1 were used. The calculated sequence alignment was validated by examining the alignment of the highly conserved amino acid residues, including the NLAXXD motif in TMD2, the (D/E)RY motif in TMD3, the CWXP motif in TMD6, and the NPXXY motif in TMD7 of G protein-coupled receptors (29Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). To construct the seven transmembrane helices and the β3-β4 hairpin structure in the N-terminal region of the 2ECL of human CXCR2, the C-α coordinates of the recently published x-ray crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1U19) (30Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) were used as the template. The intracellular and extracellular loops (i.e. 2ECL, C-terminal region, third intracellular loop, and 3ECL) that are different in length from those of rhodopsin were constructed using the loop search tool implemented in the Insight II Homology module and the C-α distance matrix from a selected data set of the Protein Data Bank. The typical disulfide linkage between TMD3 and the 2ECL common to most G protein-coupled receptors was inserted between Cys119 and Cys196. After a short minimization, the resulting structure was subjected to a 500-ps molecular dynamics simulation at 300 K, during which the transmembrane backbone atoms and the H-bonds in the 2ECL β3-β4 hairpin structure were restrained. The receptor model was sampled by extracting a snapshot of the structure every 1 ps during the simulation. The averaged structure from the last 50 ps was energy-minimized with the restraints mentioned above first and then with the transmembrane backbone constraint only. Overall, three separate simulations were repeated for WT CXCR1 (Val190) and CXCR2 (Asp199) and the mutant forms (i.e. BD199VA, BD199N, and AV190DB). Energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Origin 350 work station using the consistent force field (31Maple J. Hwang M.J. Stockfisch T.P. Hagler A.T. Isr. J. Chem. 1994; 34: 195-231Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) implemented in Insight II (Version 2005, Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The cell multipole method (32Ding H.Q. Kawasawa N. Goddard III, W.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1992; 97: 4309-4315Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar) with a distance-dependent dielectric constant (ε = ε0r, with ε0 = 4.0) was used for summation of nonbonding interactions. Expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 Chimeric Mutants in RBL-2H3 Cells—To determine the structural determinants involved in the rapid internalization of CXCR2 relative to CXCR1, four chimeric receptors with the N terminus (AB1 and BA1) or the region comprising the 4TMD and 2ECL (ABA and BAB) of CXCR1 exchanged for those of CXCR2 and vice versa were stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Competition binding of 125I-labeled CXCL8 to the chimeric receptors in the presence of unlabeled CXCL8 and Scatchard analysis demonstrated that AB1 and ABA (but not BA1 and BAB) bound CXCL8 with similar affinities compared with CXCR1 and CXCR2, respectively (Fig. 1C and Table 1). However, all receptors stimulated a rapid and transient increase in free intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and PI hydrolysis in response to both CXCL8 and CXCL1 (Fig. 2, A-C). Except for CXCR2, CXCL1 induced significantly lower PI hydrolysis relative to CXCL8 (Fig. 2C). No significant difference was found in CXCL8-induced PI hydrolysis mediated by AB1, ABA, and BA1 relative to CXCR1 and CXCR2 (3.5-4-fold over the basal level) (Fig. 2C). BAB-mediated PI hydrolysis in response to CXCL8 was significantly lower (∼2.5-fold over the basal level) compared with WT receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis. Because BAB displayed no ligand binding properties (Table 1), it is difficult to determine whether this difference is due to a decreased affinity of the chimeric receptor for CXCL8 or an impaired ability to couple to Gi to activate phospholipase Cβ.TABLE 1Ligand binding affinity of WT and chimeric CXCR1 and CXCR2 expressed in RBL-2H3 cellsReceptorKdBmax (receptors/cell)nmCXCR14.70 ± 0.09513,564 ± 679AB14.09 ± 0.04917,682 ± 1820ABA1.95 ± 0.0114,974 ± 1109CXCR22.48 ± 0.1314,092 ± 527BA1NDNDBABNDNDA4TMD B2.3 ± 0.07413,608 ± 387A2ECL BNDNDB4TMD ANDNDB2ECL A5.0 ± 0.1028995 ± 461 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Functional characterization of the WT and chimeric receptors. For intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, RBL-2H3 cells (5 × 106) stably expressing CXCR1, AB1, or ABA (A) or CXCR2, BA1, or BAB (B) were loaded with indo-1, and Ca2+ mobilization mediated by CXCL8 and CXCL1 (100 nm) was measured. For the generation of [3H]inositol phosphates, RBL-2H3 cells (50,000/well) were cultured overnight in the presence of myo[2-3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) (C). Cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 mm LiCl in a total volume of 200 μl and stimulated with CXCL8 or CXCL1 (100 nm) for 10 min. The supernatant was used to determine the release of [3H]inositol phosphates. Data are represented as the -fold stimulation over the basal level. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. For CXCL8-mediated internalization, cells were treated with CXCL8 (100 nm) at different times, washed, and assayed for 125I-labeled CXCL8 (0.1 nm) binding (D). The values are presented as a percentage of the total, which is defined as the total amount of 125I-labeled CXCL8 bound to control (untreated) cells. The experiment was repeated five times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next measured the rate of internalization of the chimeric receptors upon CXCL8 (100 nm) pretreatment. CXCL8 induced time-dependent internalization of all four receptors (Fig. 2D). AB1 and ABA internalized as rapidly as CXCR2 (∼90% after 5-10 min), whereas BA1 and BAB (∼35% after 60 min) internalized far more slowly compared with CXCR1 (∼55% after 60 min). Role of the 4TMD and 2ECL of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in Receptor Internalization—To further delineate the region(s) of CXCR1 and CXCR2 involved in receptor internalization, four additional chimeras were constructed (Fig. 3A) by exchanging either the 4TMD (A4TMDB and B4TMDA) or the 2ECL (A2ECLB and B2ECLA). Except for B4TMDA, all chimeras were stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 3B) and characterized. A4TMDB and B2ECLA (but not A2ECLB) bound CXCL8 with similar affinities compared with the WT receptors (Fig. 3C and Table 1). A4TMDB and B2ECLA mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and PI hydrolysis in response to both CXCL8 and CXCL1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Like CXCR1, A4TMDB mediated greater responses to CXCL8, whereas like CXCR2, B2ECLA responded to both ligands with similar potency. Upon CXCL8 pretreatment, A4TMDB internalized as well as CXCR1 (∼55% after 60 min) (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, B2ECLA also showed a slower time course of internalization (∼50% after 60 min) (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4Functional characterization and internalization of A2ECLB, A4TMDB, and B2ECLA. C"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulation of the human heme oxygenase-1 gene in renal epithelial cells. DNase I hyper-sensitivity studies identified three distal sites (HS-2, -3, and -4) corresponding to approximately -4.0, -7.2, and -9.2 kb, respectively, of the heme oxygenase-1 promoter in addition to one proximal region, HS-1, which we have shown previously to be an E box. In vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting of the HS-2 region revealed six individual protected guanines.

Biliverdin is subsequently reduced to bilirubin via biliverdin reductase. Two isoforms of HO have been described as follows: a highly inducible form, HO-1, and a constitutive isoform, HO-2. HO-1 is induced by several stimuli such as heme, heavy metals, cytokines, growth factors, nitric oxide, oxidized lipids, hydrogen peroxide, shear stress, glucose deprivation, angiotensin II, statins, as well as others (3Sikorski E.M. Hock T. Hill-Kapturczak N. Agarwal A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F425-F441Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated the critical importance of HO-1 expression in mediating anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects in several disease states, including acute renal failure, organ transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and vascular restenosis (2Nath K.A. Kidney Int. 2006; 70: 432-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 4Deshane J. Wright M. Agarwal A. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2005; 52: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These have been confirmed both in vitro and in vivo using pharmacological as well as genetic approaches to modulate HO-1 expression in animal models. The importance of HO-1 has also been corroborated in Ho-1 knock-out mice and a patient with HO-1 deficiency, both exhibiting increased susceptibility to inflammatory injury (5Poss K.D. Tonegawa S.

Investig. 1999; 103: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying HO-1 induction by multiple inducers are regulated predominantly at the level of transcription. Previous studies pertaining to the regulation of the mouse Ho-1 gene have focused on the transcription factors, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Bach1 (7Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S.

Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Nrf2 has been associated with the induction of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes that include but are not limited to NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase, glutathione S-transferases, HO-1, aldo-keto reductases, ferritin, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (reviewed in Ref. 9Jeong W.S. Jun M. Kong A.N. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These genes contain an extended AP-1-like element in their promoters that has been referred to as a stress-response element (StRE) or an antioxidant-response element (ARE) (10Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Upon exposure to stress, Nrf2 is proposed to be released from Keap1, its cytosolic binding partner, which then translocates to the nucleus and binds to the promoters of genes resulting in transcriptional activation (12Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 13Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M.

Recent studies, however, have challenged this concept and have suggested that Nrf2 is mostly nuclear and is recruited to the DNA constitutively to activate gene expression (17Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J.

On the other hand, Bach1, a bZip transcription factor, has been identified as a negative regulator of mouse Ho-1 induction (18Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S.

Consensus sequences for DNA-binding proteins, such as nuclear factor-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), AP-2, Sp1, upstream stimulatory factor (USF), c-Myc/Max, and interleukin-6 response elements as well as other transcription factors, have been reported in the promoter region of the human HO-1 gene (20Deramaudt B.M.

In the work presented here, using in vivo footprinting and DNase I hypersensitivity analyses of the human HO-1 promoter, we show that three regions containing a cAMP-response/AP-1 element (CRE/AP-1), ARE, and E box, respectively, are cooperatively required for hemin and cadmium-mediated HO-1 promoter activation in human renal epithelial cells. We provide evidence that JunB and JunD associate with the HO-1 promoter in vivo and are capable of influencing HO-1 expression in an opposing manner.

All mutations were made using the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The JunB expression plasmid was constructed by amplifying the JunB cDNA from HK-2 cell-derived cDNA using the primers 5′-atgtgcactaaaatggaacagcccttc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gaaggcgtgtcccttgaccccaag-3′ (reverse), 5:1 units/unit mixture of Taq and Vent DNA polymerase, and subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His Topo vector (Invitrogen). The clone was sequence-verified. The JunD expression plasmid constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Jean-Michel Mesnard (47Thebault S. Basbous J. Hivin P. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The c-Jun expression plasmid was from Dr. Rik Derynck (University of California, San Francisco). HK-2 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a batch transfection protocol as described previously (46Hill-Kapturczak N. Sikorski E. Voakes C. Garcia J. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F515-F523Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, the indicated HO-1 promoter construct was transfected into HK-2 cells at ∼90% confluency in a 10-cm tissue culture dish. Twenty four hours post-transfection the cells were split into two or three 10-cm dishes (for hGH mRNA analyses) or into a 12-well tray (for luciferase assays), in order to ensure equal transfection efficiency between experimental treatments. After the cells were allowed to recover for 16 h, each dish was treated with the stimulus (hemin or cadmium) or vehicle (control) and assayed for hGH mRNA by Northern analysis. For luciferase assays, 6 of the 12 wells derived from transfection of the promoter construct in the 10-cm dish were treated with vehicle (control) or stimulus and assayed for luciferase activity. In control experiments, wherein pcDNA3.1/lacz was co-transfected using the batch transfection protocol, equal amounts of β-galactosidase expression were observed in each of the wells (46Hill-Kapturczak N. Sikorski E. Voakes C. Garcia J. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F515-F523Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For T47D transfections, cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and pHOGL3/4.5 or mutated constructs (150 ng/well), a JunB or JunD expression plasmid (150 ng/well), and pCMX-β-gal (50 ng/well). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with control media or media containing hemin (5 μm). After an additional 24 h, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity for each well. DNase I Hypersensitivity—DNase I hypersensitivity assays were performed as described previously (48Mellott J.K. Nick H.S. Waters M.F. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Chesrown S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L390-L399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HK-2 cells were treated with hemin (5 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 2 h. Cells were collected and nuclei isolated. The nuclei were exposed to increasing amounts of DNase I for 45 s at 37 °C. The nuclei were then lysed in a standard SDS/proteinase K buffer. DNA was purified using the salt out technique (adding ⅓ volume of saturated NaCl to precipitate the SDS) followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then digested with EcoRI or HindIII. 15 μg of digested DNA was electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized with a random prime (Invitrogen)-labeled 225-bp probe that abuts the EcoRI site at -1.4 kb and extends distally. In Vivo DMS Footprinting and LMPCR—HK-2 cells were grown to ∼80% confluency on 15-cm collagen-coated plates and treated with hemin (5 μm), cadmium (10 μm), or Me2SO for 2 h. Cells were washed once at room temperature with PBS followed by DMS (0.5% in PBS) treatment for 30 s with gentle agitation. In vivo footprinting and ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) were performed as described previously (21Hock T.D. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Biochem.

After DMS treatment and piperidine cleavage, the oligonucleotide 5′-GAGGAGAATATCCAGGCAAG-3′ was annealed and extended with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The linker was ligated to the DNA fragments and subsequently amplified for 25 cycles using the HO-1 nested primer 5′-GCTGCCCAAACCACTTCTGTTTCCTGA-3′ and the linker primer 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′ (Table 1). Amplicons were electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide, 7% urea sequencing gel, electroblotted, and hybridized at 45 °C with the same nested primer end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP.

HK-2 cells grown on 10-cm collagen-coated dishes were transfected with the indicated HO-1 reporter constructs (4 μg) and, where indicated, co-transfected with an equimolar ratio of c-Jun, JunB, or JunD. Each dish was then split into two or three 10-cm dishes. After a 16-h recovery, cells were induced with hemin (5 μm), cadmium chloride (10 μm), or vehicle (Me2SO) for 16 h. Total RNA was extracted, electrophoresed, blotted, and sequentially hybridized with hGH, HO-1, and GAPDH probes as described previously (21Hock T.D. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—HK-2 cells were grown in 15-cm collagen-coated dishes and treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or hemin (5 μm) for 2 h. Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and ChIP was performed as described (21Hock T.D. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Normal rabbit serum was used instead of the primary antibody (no antibody) as a negative control. The recovered DNA was amplified for 26 cycles at three different loci. PCR products were electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized with the corresponding nested oligonucleotides listed in Table 1. Autoradiographs from 3-5 independent assays were scanned using a ScanMaker 9800 XL with Transparency Media adapter (Microtek, Carson, CA) using Adobe Photoshop Elements version 2.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc. San Jose, CA), and densitometry was performed using NIH Image 1.63 software. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HK-2 cells stimulated with hemin (5 μm), cadmium (10 μm), or vehicle (Me2SO) as described previously (21Hock T.D. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were electrophoresed in a 0.5× TBE, 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, fixed, dried, and exposed to film. The G-5 wild-type probe consisted of the following oligonucleotides and its complement annealed, 5′-gctagattttgctgagtCaCcagtgcctcctcagc-3′. The G-5 and G-6 nucleotides are in uppercase left to right, respectively and were mutated to form AT base pairs. Supershifts were performed by adding 2 μg of the indicated antibody after addition of labeled probe and incubated at 22 °C for 15 min. HEK293 cells were grown in 10-cm collagen-coated dishes and transfected with 10 μg of Nrf2-GFP plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Tony Kong, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway) for 24 h. Gel shift assays were performed using whole cell extracts as described (50Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Ellerbe M. Figueroa Y.G. Blank V. Beckman B.S. Alam J. J. Biol.

Immunocytochemistry—HK-2 cells were plated on collagen-coated chambered slides and transfected with the indicated expression construct. After 16 h, the cells were stimulated with vehicle (Me2SO) or hemin (5 μm) for 7 h. Cells were fixed in cold methanol for 5 min and then washed with PBS twice. Cells were incubated in PBS containing 7% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were added (1:400 dilution) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After several PBS/Tween 20 washes, secondary antibodies were added in the presence of 10% normal goat serum for 2 h at 22 °C. A polyclonal anti-HO-1 antibody was used as primary and detected with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (green). JunB was detected with antiV5-mAb, and AlexaFluor 594 (red)-labeled secondary antibody. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue) was used as a nuclear stain. Image acquisition was performed using a Leica DM6000 epifluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) with a Hamamatsu ORCA ER cooled CCD camera and SimplePCI software. Images from 8 to 10 fields were captured using a ×20 objective, and total number of cells expressing JunB, JunD, and Ho-1 were counted from three independent experiments. Western Blot Analysis—For junB+/+ and junB-/- MEFs, nuclear extracts were harvested as described previously (21Hock T.D. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for the gel shift assays, and 75 μg of nuclear protein was electrophoresed on a 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For junD+/+ and junD-/- MEFs, whole cell protein was lysed in RIPA buffer and quantitated using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and 25 μg of total protein was electrophoresed on a 12% Trisglycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA), JunB and JunD were detected using 1:200 dilutions of rabbit anti-JunB (N-17, sc-46; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-JunD (sc-74; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Protein was visualized using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Real Time PCR—The junB+/+, junB-/-, junD+/+, and junD-/- MEFs were stimulated with vehicle (Me2SO) or hemin (5 μm), and RNA was collected at 2 and 5 h as described previously (21Hock T.D. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The RNA was then precipitated with 1.75 m lithium chloride on ice for 2h. An equal volume of 70% ethanol was added, and the RNA was collected by centrifugation. After drying, the RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and its integrity was verified by gel electrophoresis. 3 μg was used in 1st strand cDNA synthesis using a superscript kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then diluted to a total of 50 μl, and 1 μl of this was used in amplification. Quantitative real time PCR was performed with 2× SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and 900 nm primers for mouse Ho-1 and GAPDH. Cycling was performed on a Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT sequence detection system with the following cycling parameters: 50 °C for 2 min, Taq activation at 95 °C for 10 min. then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min.

In the preceding studies, we identified a set of metabolic genes of the l-arabinose pathway including the KGSADH gene (Watanabe, S., Kodaki, T., and Makino, K. (2006) J. Biol.

Here, we describe that A. brasilense possesses two different KGSADH isozymes from l-arabinose-related enzyme (KGSADH-I); that is, d-glucarate/d-galactarate-inducible KGSADH-II and hydroxy-l-proline-inducible KGSADH-III. They were purified homogeneously from A. brasilense cells grown on d-galactarate or hydroxy-l-proline, respectively. When compared with KGSADH-I, amino acid sequences of KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III were significantly similar but not totally identical. Physiological characterization using recombinant enzymes revealed that KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III showed similar high substrate specificity for αKGSA and different coenzyme specificity; that is, NAD+-dependent KGSADH-II and NADP+-dependent KGSADH-III. In the phylogenetic tree of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily, KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III were poorly related to the known ALDH subclasses including KGSADH-I. On the other hand, ALDH-like ycbD protein involved in d-glucarate/d-galactarate operon from Bacillus subtilis is closely related to the methylmalonyl semialdehyde dehydrogenase subclass but not A. brasilense KGSADH isozymes. To estimate the correct function, the corresponding gene was expressed, purified, and characterized. Kinetic analysis revealed the physiological role as NADP+-dependent KGSADH. We conclude that three different types of KGSADH appeared in the bacterial evolutional stage convergently. Furthermore, even the same pathway such as l-arabinose and d-glucarate/d-galactarate metabolism also evolved by the independent involvement of KGSADH.

To our knowledge there are four potential metabolic pathways, including KGSADH, in which the enzyme reaction is commonly located in the final step, and αKGSA is provided from each different precursor (Fig. 1A). In an alternative bacterial pathway of l-arabinose metabolism different from the general pathway including Escherichia coli (1Stryer L. Biochemistry.3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1988: 805-807Google Scholar), l-arabinose is converted to l-2-keto-3-deoxyarabonate (l-KDA) through l-arabino-γ-lactone and l-arabonate by the consecutive action of enzymes l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (AraA, EC 1.1.1.46), l-arabinolactonalase (AraB, EC 3.1.1.15) and l-arabonate dehydratase (AraC, EC 4.2.1.25) (2Welmberg R.

There are two metabolic fates of l-KDA depending on bacterial species. In the first alternative pathway l-KDA is dehydrated by l-KDA dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.43) to produce αKGSA, which is provided as a substrate for KGSADH (first pathway including KGSADH) (2Welmberg R. Doudoroff M. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 607-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Duncan M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 113: 177-179Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Novick N.J.

In another alternative pathway, aldol cleavage occurs in l-KDA by l-KDA aldolase (EC 4.1.2.18) to produce pyruvate and glycolaldehyde (3Dahms A.S. Anderson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 36: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Duncan M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 113: 177-179Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Duncan M.J. Fraenkel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 415-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are in the process of characterizing enzymatically and genetically the alternative l-arabinose pathway of Azospirillum brasilense, in which the first pathway is operative (7Novick N.J. Tyler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 364-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, the identification of AraA, AraB, AraC, and AraD genes revealed that they are clustered as a single transcriptional unit on the genome of A. brasilense (a novel l-arabinose operon; see supplemental Fig. S4), and the l-arabinose pathway is significantly related to other sugar metabolisms including the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway and non-phosphorylative ED pathway (9Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Watanabe S. Shimada N. Tajima K. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33521-33536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the gene encoding KGSADH (AraE) is located separately from the l-arabinose operon (11Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). l-Arabinose-related KGSADH (referred to as “KGSADH-I” in this study) is a novel member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily and is phylogenetically related to the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.24) subclass. To our knowledge this is the first genetic report of KGSADH. d-Galactarate (mucic acid) is a natural product that occurs in various fruits and, like d-glucarate (d-saccharic acid), serves as a growth substrate for many organisms. The d-galactarate/d-glucarate pathway of E. coli has been studied extendedly (12Hubbard B.K. Koch M. Palmer D.R. Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A.

In this pathway, d-galactarate and d-glucarate are dehydrated to a common intermediate, d-5-keto-4-deoxyglucarate (d-KDG) by d-galactarate dehydratase (GadD, EC 4.2.1.42), and d-glucarate dehydratase (GudD, EC 4.2.1.40), respectively. d-KDG is converted by d-KDG aldolase (GarL, EC 4.1.2.20) to pyruvate and tartronate semialdehyde, and tartronate semialdehyde is then reduced to d-glycerate by tartronate semialdehyde reductase (GarR, EC 1.1.1.60). Finally, d-glycerate is phosphorylated by glycerate kinase (GarK, EC 2.7.1.31) to yield 3-phosphoglycerate; therefore, pyruvate and 3-phosphoglycerate are the endproducts of this pathway. Two gene clusters are related to this pathway on the genome of E. coli, GudP-YgcY-GudD and GarP-GarL-GarR-GarK (YgcY, non-functional GudP; GudP, d-glucarate permease; GarP, d-galactarate permease (see supplemental Fig. S4)). On the other hand, it is believed that there is an alternative pathway for bacterial d-galactarate/d-glucarate metabolism (Fig. 1A) in which d-KDG is decarboxylating-dehydrated by d-KDG dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.41) to produce αKGSA as a substrate for KGSADH (second and third pathways including KGSADH). This hypothetical pathway has been tentatively proposed in Pseudomonas sp. (13Dagley S. Trudgill P.W. Biochem. J. 1965; 95: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Pseudomonas putida (14Adams E. Rosso G. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1802-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Koo P.H. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1704-1716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently identified in Bacillus subtilis (16Hosoya S. Yamane K. Takeuchi M. Sato T. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2002; 210: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar). Homologous genes for E. coli Gud and Gar genes in B. subtilis contain six genes that occur in the order of ycbC (d-KDG dehydratase), ycbD (ALDH?), ycbE (GarD), ycbF (GudD), ycbG (transcriptional regulator), ycbH (GarD) in a transcriptional unit (so-called ycbCDEFGH operon; see supplemental Fig. S4). Although Hosoya et al. (16Hosoya S. Yamane K. Takeuchi M. Sato T. FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2002; 210: 193-199PubMed Google Scholar) expected that ALDH-like ycbD protein may dehydrate d-glucuronolactone to d-glucarate, it is rather likely that the protein functions as KGSADH (11Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Brouns S.J. Walther J. Snijders A.P. van de Werken H.J. Willemen H.L.

Although hydroxy-l-proline (4-hydroxyproline) exists in collagen and the cell wall of plant and algae, the metabolism of the free compound has been mainly studied in mammals (for review, see Ref. 18Adams E. Frank L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 1005-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In this pathway hydroxy-l-proline is converted to pyruvate and glyoxylate through 1-pyrroline-3-hydroxy-5-carboxylate, l-erythro-4-hydroxyglutamate, and d-4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate. On the other hand, in the bacterial pathway outlined by several studies of P. putida (14Adams E. Rosso G. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1802-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Koo P.H. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1704-1716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Singh R.M.M. Adams E. Science. 1964; 144: 67-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), the first reaction step is catalyzed by hydroxyproline epimerase (EC 5.1.1.8) to produce allohydroxy-d-proline, which is then oxidized to 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate by d-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3). Finally, 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate is converted to αKGSA by 1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.22) (fourth pathway, including KGSADH). There is no genetic report of these hypothetical metabolic enzymes. A functional class of “isozymes” comprises those associated with a common enzymatic step by separate but converging metabolic pathways. In one such case, P. putida possesses four KGSADH isozymes, among which three enzymes are induced by hydroxy-l-proline, d-glucarate, and l-lysine, and the remainder is expressed constitutively, although there is no literature about the genetic characterization (14Adams E. Rosso G. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1802-1814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Koo P.H. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1704-1716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, our tentative analysis revealed that A. brasilense possess another d-glucarate/d-galactarate-inducible KGSADH isozyme in addition to l-arabinose-related KGSADH-I (11Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on this insight, we here describe the identification and characterization of d-glucarate/d-galactarate-inducible isozyme (referred to as KGSADH-II) and another hydroxy-l-proline-inducible isozyme (referred to as KGSADH-III). Interestingly, both isozymes were clearly distinguished to KGSADH-I not only enzymatically but also phylogenetically. Furthermore, the characterization of ycbD protein from B. subtilis revealed the correct physiological function as αKGSA and the unique phylogenetic relationship with KGSADH-I, KGSADH-II, and KGSADH-III. Convergent evolution within the ALDH superfamily and metabolic evolution of l-arabinose, d-glucarate, d-galactarate, and hydroxy-l-proline pathways will be discussed. Bacterial Strain, Culture Conditions, and Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—A. brasilenseATCC29145 was cultivated aerobically for 48 h at 30 °C as described previously (9Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As a carbon source, d-galactarate (mucic acid) or d-glucarate (d-sacchric acid) was adjusted to pH 6.8 with NaOH and added to synthetic medium at a concentration of 37 mm. Hydroxy-l-proline was sterilized separately by filtration and added to nutrient medium (final concentration of 37 mm). The grown cells were harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min, washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (referred to as buffer A), and stored at -35 °C until use. The washed cells were suspended in buffer A, disrupted by sonication for 20 min at appropriate intervals on ice using ASTRASON® Ultrasonic Liquid Processor XL2020 (Misonix Incorporated, NY), and then centrifuged at 108,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain cell-free extracts. PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Non-denaturing PAGE was performed by omitting SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol from the solution used in SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and destained with 7.5% (v/v) acetic acid in 25% methanol. Enzyme Activity Assay—KGSADH activity was assayed routinely in the direction of aldehyde oxidation by measuring the reduction of NAD(P)+ at 340 nm at 25 °C using a Jasco spectrophotometer model V-550 (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (11Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 1 mm αKGSA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoehtanol in 66.7 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 15 mm NAD(P)+ solution (100 μl) with a final reaction volume of 1 ml. In the case of water-insoluble aldehyde, 10 mm substrates in ethanol (0.1 volume) were added to the standard assay solution. Although slightly increasing absorbance was observed due to emulsion formation, reasonable agreement was obtained for αKGSA as a substrate in the presence or absence of ethanol (data not shown). αKGSA was synthesized from l-arabonate (K+ salt) by sequential reactions with l-arabonate dehydratase (AraC) and l-KDA dehydratase (AraD) of A. brasilense (10Watanabe S. Shimada N. Tajima K. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33521-33536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). l-Arabonate was prepared by the hypoiodite-in-methanol oxidization of l-a-rabinose (21Moore S. Link K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1940; 133: 293-311Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (10 ml) contained 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mml-arabonate in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.2. After the addition of each 50 mg of purified recombinant AraC and AraD proteins, the mixture was left for 1 h at room temperature. High performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed the complete conversion of l-arabonate to αKGSA via l-KDA (data not shown). To remove proteins, the solution was then applied to Centriplus YM-30 (Millipore) and centrifuged at 18,000 × g until the membrane was dry. The recovered sample was used as 10 mm αKGSA solution. The kinetic parameters, Km and kcat values, were calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plot. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Zymogram Staining Analysis—Cell-free extract or purified enzyme was separated on non-denaturing PAGE with 6% gel at 4 °C. The gels were then soaked in 10 ml of staining solution (23Gennady P.M. Handbook of Detection of Enzymes on Electrophoretic Gels.2nd Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2002: 27-33Google Scholar) consisting of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm αKGSA, 0.25 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.06 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 1.5 mm NAD(P)+ at room temperature for 15 min. Dehydrogenase activity appeared as a dark band. Functional Expression and Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—Purification of native KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III from A. brasilense cells and cloning of the corresponding genes were described in detail in supplemental “Methods.” To introduce the restriction site for BamHI and HindIII at 5′- and 3′-termini of KGSADH-II, KGSADH-III, and ycbD genes, PCR was carried out using pGEM-IID, pGEM-III, and pGEM-ycbD, respectively, as template DNA, and the appropriate primer set shown in supplemental Table S1. Each amplified DNA fragment was introduced into BamHI-HindIII sites in pQE-80L (Qiagen), a plasmid vector for conferring N-terminal His6 tag on expressed proteins, to obtain pHIS-II, pHIS-III, and pHIS-ycbD, respectively. E. coli DH5α harboring the expression plasmid for His6-tagged protein was grown at 37 °C to a turbidity of 0.6 at 600 nm in Super broth medium (pH 7.0, 12 g of Tryptone, 24 g of yeast extract, 5 ml of glycerol, 3.81 g of KH2PO4, and 12.5 g of K2HPO4 per liter) containing 50 mg/liter ampicillin. After the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the culture was further grown for 6 h to induce the expression of His6-tagged protein. Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer D (pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole). The cells were then disrupted by sonication, and the solution was centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed 3 times with buffer E (pH 8.0, buffer D containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 mm imidazole instead of 10 mm imidazole). The enzymes were then eluted with buffer F (pH 8.0, buffer E containing 250 mm imidazole instead of 50 mm imidazole). The elutant was dialyzed against buffer C and stored at -35 °C until use. Northern Blot Analysis—A. brasilense cells were cultured at 30 °C to the mid-log phase (A600 = 0.6∼0.8) in minimal medium containing d-glucarate or d-galactarate or nutrient medium supplemented with hydroxy-l-proline and harvested by centrifugation. Total RNA preparation and Northern hybridization were performed as described previously (11Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Amino Acid Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis—For phylogenetic analysis, 145 ALDH sequences were obtained from a website devoted to ALDHs (24Perozich J. Nicholas H. Wang B.C. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several ALDH sequences, which have been recently identified, were added (see legend of Fig. 5, B and C). The sequences were aligned using the program, ClustalW, distributed by DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan). The phylogenetic tree was produced using the TreeView 1.6.1. program. Identification of Two KGSADH Isozymes of A. brasilense—αKGSA is believed to be a potential intermediate in l-arabinose, d-glucarate, d-galactarate, and hydroxy-l-proline metabolisms (Fig. 1A). The common metabolic fate of αKGSA is to be converted to α-ketoglutarate by NAD(P)+-dependent KGSADH. In the preceding study (11Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) we identified NAD+-preferring KGSADH involved in an alternative l-arabinose pathway of A. brasilense (referred to as KGSADH-I in this study). The enzyme is a tetrameric form, and the active band in Zymogram staining appears in a relative upper range (see Fig. 3B). On the other hand, when compared with nutrient medium, 18- and 22-fold higher NAD+-preferring dehydrogenase activity for αKGSA was contained in cell-free extracts from A. brasilense cells grown on d-glucarate or d-galactarate as the sole carbon source, respectively (Fig. 2B). Zymogram staining revealed that the corresponding KGSADHs seem to derive from the same enzyme, which is different from KGSADH-I (Figs. 2A, and 3B); we referred to the d-glucarate/d-galactarate-inducible KGSADH isozyme as “KGSADH-II.” On the other hand, similar high NAD+-preferring KGSADH activity was also observed in cell-free extract prepared from A. brasilense cells grown in the presence of hydroxy-l-proline, although the inducibility (6.6-fold) was lower than those of d-glucarate and d-galactarate (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the major active band in zymogram staining was different from that of KGSADH-II (and also KGSADH-I) (Figs. 2, A and B), indicating that A. brasilense possesses another third hydroxy-l-proline-inducible KGSADH isozyme (referred to as “KGSADH-III”). It is reported that P. putida possesses l-lysine-inducible glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.20), which also reacts with αKGSA significantly (25Chang Y.F. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7979-7986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of A. brasilense, there was no induction of such as a dehydrogenase in the cell-free extract (data not shown).FIGURE 2Identification of two KGSADH isozymes of A. brasilense.

Fifty μg of the cell-free extract was applied in 6% (w/v) non-denaturing PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in staining solution in the presence of 1 mm αKGSA and 1.5 mm NAD(P)+. d-Glucarate/d-galactarate-inducible KGSADH and hydroxy-l-proline-inducible KGSADH were referred to as KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III, respectively (open triangles on the right-hand side).

Purified KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III showed similar NAD+-preferring specific activity: 19.8 and 14.4 units/mg of protein, respectively. In zymogram staining, active bands of purified KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III corresponded to a major dehydrogenase for αKGSA in cell-free extracts prepared from A. brasilense cells grown on d-galactarate or hydroxy-l-proline, respectively (see Fig. 3B). Both KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III (polypeptide II in sample I) consisted of only one subunit with an apparent Mr value of 57.0 and possessed similar N-terminal amino acid sequences to many (functional and/or putative) ALDHs (see supplemental Fig. S1). In particular, putative ALDHs from Burkholderia cepacia strain R18194 (BcKGSADH-II (NCBI accession numbers YP_371088) and BcKGSADH-III (YP_372655), respectively)) possessed almost identical N-terminal sequences to KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III: MQLTGEMLIGADAVAGSAGTLRAFD and MQLTGQLLIGQSAVAGPNGTLHAIA (underlined letters indicate the same amino acid residues as A. brasilense enzymes). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III were significantly similar compared with that of KGSADH-I but were not completely identical (see supplemental Fig. S2). In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the spot corresponding to KGSADH-III appeared in the basic range, compared with KGSADH-II (data not shown). Furthermore, MALDI-QIT-TOF mass spectrum profiles using tryptic peptides of KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III were significantly different (see supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). These results indicated that both isozymes are derived from different genes but not from posttranslational modification of a single enzyme such as phosphorylation and/or glycosylation. Cloning of the Genes Encoding KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III—It is noteworthy that A. brasilense possesses a very similar partial genome sequence to B. cepacia strain R18194 (9Watanabe S. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2612-2623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Watanabe S. Shimada N. Tajima K. Kodaki T. Makino K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28876-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In fact, B. cepacia strain R18194 possesses ALDHs (KGSADHs) with a similar N-terminal amino acid sequence to KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III from A. brasilense, as described above. Therefore, 5′- and 3′-terminal sequences and/or flanking regions of BcKGSADH-II and BcKGSADH-III genes were referred for A. brasilense genomic PCR (see supplemental “Methods”), and we succeeded in isolating the DNA fragments containing the full-length KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III genes (pGEM-IID and pGEM-III in supplemental Fig. S4, respectively). The nucleotide sequences of KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III genes were submitted to GenBank™ with accession numbers AB275768 and AB275769, respectively. Although both isolated KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III genes contained the same N-terminal amino acid sequences as those determined from the purified enzymes, there is a possibility of another candidate(s) encoding to KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III enzymes. Therefore, to estimate information about the internal peptide sequence, samples I and II were further purified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subjected to MALDI-QIT-TOF mass spectrometry (see supplemental “Methods”). The MS profile(s) contained many peaks corresponding to the theoretical internal peptides expected from KGSADH-II or KGSADH-III genes (40.4 and 38.7% of sequence coverage, respectively) (see supplemental Fig. S3, A and B, and Tables S3 and S4). Furthermore, MS/MS confirmed internal amino acid sequences of KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III (see supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). These results indicated that the isolated KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III genes surely encode to purified KGSADH-II and KGSADH-III enzyme"

Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses have indicated that the mesoglea is organized as two sub-epithelial thin layers of basal lamina sandwiching a central interstitial zone (11Sarras Jr., M.P.

Expression studies have revealed that the collagen genes (Hcol1 and Hcol4) appear to be expressed exclusively by ectoderm (7Fowler S.J. Jose S. Zhang X. Deutzmann R. Sarras Jr., M.P.

The regeneration involves cell migration to cover the wound and de novo ECM synthesis at the regenerating tip (12Shimizu H. Zhang X. Zhang J. Leontovich A. Fei K. Yan L. Sarras Jr., M.P. Development. 2002; 129: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ECM re-synthesis and assembly at the regenerating tip provides an attractive and simple multicellular model for studies of ECM structure and function in vivo in the laboratory setting.Here we report the characterization of a further three hydra fibrillar collagen genes (Hcol2, Hcol3, and Hcol5). In addition, we report the partial characterization of a novel hydra collagen gene (Hcol6) with a unique organization consisting of vWF A domains interspersed with interrupted triple-helical domains. We demonstrate by phylogenetic analyses that the hydra fibrillar collagen genes form a distinct clade that appears related to the protostome/deuterostome A clade of fibrillar collagens. We demonstrate by searching EST databases that most of these genes are highly conserved in the related Hydra magnipapillata and provide the first evidence for the existence of B-clade fibrillar collagens in diploblasts. Each collagen gene is expressed in highly specific developmentally regulated patterns solely within the ectoderm. These four novel Hydra vulgaris collagen genes provide new insights into the molecular evolution of collagens and the organization and structure of metazoan extracellular matrices.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Maintenance—H. vulgaris, L2 stain was used for in situ hybridization experiments. Animals were cultured in M solution (13Lenhoff H.M. Lenhoff H.M. Hydra: Research Methods. Plenum Press, New York1983: 29-34Google Scholar) and fed with freshly hatched Artemia nauplii three times a week. All experiments were carried out 24-48 h after feeding.cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—The isolation of the original cDNA clones for the different collagen genes by differential screening of regenerating hydra cDNA libraries and the subsequent cloning and sequencing of overlapping cDNAs for each gene were performed as described previously (7Fowler S.J.

Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4877-4882Google Scholar). Gap-containing sites were removed from each alignment, and a Neighbor Joining tree was inferred. The topology of this tree was tested using four independent methods. Neighbor Joining and Maximum Parsimony bootstrap replicates were obtained using PROTDIST, NEIGHBOR, and PROTPARS from the PHYLIP package (15Felsenstein J.P. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar). Maximum Likelihood trees were inferred using PROML from the PHYLIP package (15Felsenstein J.P.

The JTT model of amino acid substitutions was used with global rearrangements and correction for rate heterogeneity (α value was obtained from TREEPUZZLE (16Strimmer K. von Haesler A. Proc. Natl.

MrBayes: Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny. Department of Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY2000Google Scholar).Identification of vWF A Domains and WAP Domains—vWF A and WAP domains were originally identified using the rpsblast and cdart protocols (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Alignments were performed using Clustal programs as indicated in the legends to the appropriate figures. vWF A domain MIDAS motifs, α helices, and β strands were predicted based upon Jackson et al.

PCR primers were synthesized according to the sequences of hydra collagens. The primer sequences are: Hcol2, accacctggtgtcaaaaggag and aagccccaattcttccttgt; Hcol3, ttcctggtgagagaggtgct and taccttgagcgccttgttct; Hcol5, accacctggtgtcaaaaggag and aagccccaattcttccttgt; Hcol6, accacctggtgtcaaaaggag and aagccccaattcttccttgt. PCR fragments were cloned into pCR II vector (Invitrogen) and linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes. In vitro transcription was carried out using “Maxiscript” kit (Ambion) and Dig labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer protocols. Both wild type adult polyps and polyps that were decapitated and followed during head regeneration for different times were used for in situ. The whole-mount in situ hybridization reaction was carried out the same way as described previously (7Fowler S.J. Jose S. Zhang X. Deutzmann R. Sarras Jr., M.P. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Biol.

Samples were treated with ethanol and proteinase K, re-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and hybridized with probes in hybridization solution (50% form-amide, 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 1× Denhardt’s solution, 200 mg/ml tRNA, 100 mg/ml heparin, 0.1% Chaps, and 0.1% Tween 20). Hybridization was carried out for 65 h followed by washing steps using SSC. Anti-digoxigenin antibody (AP-conjugated, 1:2000 dilution, Roche Applied Science) was used to detect probe labeling, and BM Purple (Roche Applied Science) was used as an alkaline phosphatase substrate for color reaction. Some samples were embedded in JB4 after the color reaction and sectioned (20-μm thickness) with a glass knife for microscopic examination.RESULTSFour Novel Collagen Genes Identified in H. vulgaris—Differential screening of a cDNA library using a combination of nonstringent and stringent conditions resulted in the identification of four novel collagen genes in addition to the previously described fibrillar Hcol1 (8Deutzmann R.

Fibrillar collagen NC1 domains have 8 cysteine residues (19Lees J.F. Bullied N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24354-24360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 6 of these (numbers 1 and 4-8) are conserved in all of the hydra fibrillar collagens (Fig. 2). Cysteine 2 is present in Hcol2, and cysteine 3 is in Hcol1 (Fig. 2). All of the hydra fibrillar collagens have the short chain selectivity sequence (Fig. 2) exhibited by invertebrate fibrillar collagen chains (3Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S.

Open table in a new tab The major helical domains of Hcol2 and Hcol5 are 1020-1023 amino acid residues in length, which is very similar to most other fibrillar collagens, whereas the same domain in Hcol3 is significantly shorter (969 residues) (Table 1, Fig. 2). The three novel hydra fibrillar collagen genes contain uninterrupted N-terminal minor triple helical domains separated from their respective major collagenous domains by telopeptide-like sequences.By amino acid composition, all of the hydra fibrillar collagenous domains have ∼33% glycine content (Table 2). However, the hydra chains (which appear related to the A-clade; see below) contain lower levels of alanine and higher levels of lysine than most A clade fibrillar collagen domains (Table 2). Proline levels in the hydra chains are considerably lower than those in the classical vertebrate collagens (types I-III, V, and XI) but are typical for invertebrate fibrillar collagens (Table 2).TABLE 2Amino acid composition of the collagenous domains of specified α chains Open table in a new tab N-terminal Non-collagenous Domains of the Novel Fibrillar Collagens—The sequence for Hcol2 is full-length, and the N-terminal non-collagenous domain consists of a signal peptide followed by a whey acidic protein 4 disulfide core (WAP) domain (Fig. 3). The sequence of Hcol3 N-terminal to the minor collagenous domain consists of a tandem repeat of a vWF A and WAP domain (Fig. 1A, Table 1); this sequence is not full-length as we have yet to identify a start codon followed by a signal peptide. The Hcol2 and Hcol3_1 WAP domains have complete 8 cysteine complements with the position of cysteine 2 being least constrained as seen in other WAP domains (Fig. 3). The more C-terminal Hcol3_2 WAP domain is missing the cysteine at position 7 of the 8-cysteine motif (Fig. 3). The vWF A domains of Hcol3 are discussed in detail below. The N-terminal non-collagenous region of Hcol5 has yet to be cloned.FIGURE 3Alignment of hydra Hcol2 and Hcol3 WAP domains with human WAP domain-containing proteins.

A condensed version of this alignment containing hydra and representative human fibrillar collagen sequences is presented in Fig. 2. These alignments were then used for phylogenetic analyses to determine the evolutionary relationships of the hydra genes. The results indicate that the four hydra fibrillar collagen sequences cluster weakly with the A rather than B or C clade genes in all four of the different phylogenetic methods used in this analysis (Fig. 4). The clustering of the hydra genes in the deepest region of the A clade indicates that these genes have evolved within the hydra lineage and are not directly related to individual fibrillar collagen genes in the vertebrate lineage. The analyses provide very strong support for the contention that Hcol3 and -5 and Hcol1 and -2 are paralogous pairs that have evolved after the divergence of diploblasts such as hydra and triploblasts such as arthropods (apis), echinoderms (urchin), or chordates (ciona and vertebrates) (Fig. 4).TABLE 3Accession numbers for sequences used in phylogenetic analysesLineageSpeciesDatabaseAccession no.Gene IDChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_000079Col1a1ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_000080Col1a2ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_001835Col2a1ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_000081Col3a1ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_000084Col5a1ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_000384Col5a2ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_056534Col5a3ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_542196Col11a1ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_542411Col11a2ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_690850Col24a1ChordateHomo sapiensNCBINP_116277Col27a1UrochordateCiona intestinalisJGIci0100150759Ciona150759UrochordateCiona intestinalisJGIci0100154301Ciona154301UrochordateCiona intestinalisJGIci0100131606Ciona131606UrochordateCiona intestinalisJGIci0100144916Ciona144916EchinodermStrongylocentrotus purpuratusNCBIQ26634Urchin a1EchinodermStrongylocentrotus purpuratusNCBIQ26639Urchin a2EchinodermParacentrotus lividusNCBIAJ601384Urchin a5ArthropodApis melliferaNCBIXP_393523Apis a1ArthropodApis melliferaNCBIXP_391942Apis a2ArthropodAnopheles gambiaeNCBIENSANGP00000021001Anopheles a2CnidariaHomo vulgarisNCBIAAM77398Hcol1CnidariaHomo vulgarisNCBIDQ679807Hcol2CnidariaHomo vulgarisNCBIDQ679808Hcol3CnidariaHomo vulgarisNCBIDQ679809Hcol5CnideriaHomo vulgarisNCBIDQ679810Hcol6PoriferaEuchitonia. mulleriNCBIP18856Sponge Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Phylogenetic analysis of hydra fibrillar collagen genes with respective protostome and deuterostome orthologues.

The sequence alignment (Fig. 6) was produced using ClustalW with manual adjustment and is more reliable in the N-terminal portion of the domain because of the relative lack of sequence conservation toward the C terminus. The hydra sequences all show the characteristic pattern of alternating β strands and α helices predicted for vWF A domains (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W2027909218,"Parasporin-1 is a novel non-insecticidal inclusion protein from Bacillus thuringiensis that is cytotoxic to specific mammalian cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of parasporin-1 on toxin-sensitive cell lines to elucidate the cytotoxic mechanism of parasporin-1. Parasporin-1 is not a membrane pore-forming toxin as evidenced by measurements of lactate dehydrogenase release, propidium iodide penetration, and membrane potential in parasporin-1-treated cells. Parasporin-1 decreased the level of cellular protein and DNA synthesis in parasporin-1-sensitive HeLa cells. The earliest change observed in cells treated with this toxin was a rapid elevation of the intracellular free-Ca2+ concentration; increases in the intracellular Ca2+ levels were observed 1-3 min following parasporin-1 treatment. Using four different cell lines, we found that the degree of cellular sensitivity to parasporin-1 was positively correlated with the size of the increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The toxin-induced elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was markedly decreased in low-Ca2+ buffer and was not observed in Ca2+-free buffer. Accordingly, the cytotoxicity of parasporin-1 decreased in the low-Ca2+ buffer and was restored by the addition of Ca2+ to the extracellular medium. Suramin, which inhibits trimeric G-protein signaling, suppressed both the Ca2+ influx and the cytotoxicity of parasporin-1. In parasporin-1-treated HeLa cells, degradation of pro-caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was observed. Furthermore, synthetic caspase inhibitors blocked the cytotoxic activity of parasporin-1. These results indicate that parasporin-1 activates apoptotic signaling in these cells as a result of the increased Ca2+ level and that the Ca2+ influx is the first step in the pathway that underlies parasporin-1 toxicity.

Pathogenic bacteria produce a wide variety of protein toxins and toxin-like molecules. These toxins and toxin-like molecules have been studied extensively to understand the diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria and to find effective preventive treatments. It is known that bacterial toxins affect the enzymic or non-enzymic activities of specific host molecules, which are often critical for cell function, resulting in inhibition or excess activation of these targets. Although bacterial toxins differ in their modes of action, they often show strict target specificities when compared with chemically synthesized drugs. Thus, bacterial toxins can be used as powerful therapeutic agents or as tools in biological studies (1Sandvig K. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacillus thuringiensis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that produces parasporal inclusions during sporulation. The inclusions often contain one or more insecticidal proteins that are toxic to the larvae of certain insects and, in some cases, to nematodes, mites, and protozoa (2Schnepf E. Crickmore N. Van Rie J. Lereclus D. Baum J. Feitelson J. Zeigler D.R. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 775-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is a remarkable diversity of B. thuringiensis strains and inclusion proteins. Previous studies have identified a number of noninsecticidal B. thuringiensis strains in natural environments, even outnumbering the insecticidal strains (3Ohba M. Aizawa K. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1986; 47: 12-20Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 4Meadows M.P. Ellis D.J. Butt J. Jarrett P. Burges H.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 1344-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the non-insecticidal B. thuringiensis strains, we found strains that produced a novel class of inclusion proteins. These inclusion proteins were non-hemolytic and were cytotoxic to cultured mammalian cells, including human cancer cell lines (5Mizuki E. Ohba M. Akao T. Yamashita S. Saitoh H. Park Y.S. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 86: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The biochemical characteristics of the cytotoxic proteins, including their cell specificities and cytotoxic activities, were highly heterogeneous; some affected a wide range of human cells, whereas others killed only a few specific cell types (5Mizuki E. Ohba M. Akao T. Yamashita S. Saitoh H. Park Y.S. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 86: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6Ito A. Sasaguri M. Kitada S. Kusaka Y. Kuwano K. Masutomi K. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21282-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Lee D.W. Akao T. Yamashita S. Katayama H. Maeda M. Saitoh H.

Microbiol. 2000; 46: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These proteins do not belong to the same class as the Cyt proteins, which similarly exhibit cytotoxicity against mammalian cells but also have hemolytic and insecticidal activities. Based on these observations, we classified these proteins into a new “parasporin” protein family, members of which are preferentially cytotoxic to mammalian cells (9Mizuki E. Park Y.S. Saitoh H. Yamashita S. Akao T. Higuchi K. Ohba M. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2000; 7: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To date, four members of the parasporin family have been identified (10Katayama H. Yokota H. Akao T. Nakamura O. Ohba M. Mekada E. Mizuki E. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Parasporin-1 is produced as an 81-kDa parasporal inclusion protein (pro-parasporin-1) by the A1190 strain of B. thuringiensis, one of our isolates. The active form of parasporin-1 is a heterodimer composed of 15- and 56-kDa subunits that are created when pro-parasporin-1 is cleaved by trypsin at two sites (10Katayama H. Yokota H. Akao T. Nakamura O. Ohba M. Mekada E. Mizuki E. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Purified parasporin-1 is highly cytotoxic to certain cell lines, implying that the toxin-sensitive cell lines have a specific receptor for parasporin-1. Although the cytotoxic mechanism of parasporin-1 seems to differ from those of other known membrane pore-forming toxins such as the B. thuringiensis insecticidal Cry and Cyt toxins, the nature of the cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanism have not yet been clarified. In this study, we have investigated the cytotoxic action of parasporin-1. Among the various changes in cells treated with parasporin-1, the initial effect we observed was an unusually large influx of extracellular Ca2+. The cytotoxicity of parasporin-1 was attenuated by low extracellular concentrations of Ca2+, suggesting that parasporin-1 induces excess Ca2+ influx, resulting in the apoptotic death of the target cell.

Probenecid, valinomycin, nigericin, streptolysin O (SLO), and suramin were purchased from Sigma, and DiSC3(5) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fura-2 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester and Pluronic F-127 were obtained from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan). MTS assay kits (Cell Titer96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay) and Polybuffer 96 were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Prepared DMEM and Ca2+-free DMEM were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-PARP monoclonal antibodies, anti-caspase-3 monoclonal antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were purchased from MBL Corp. (Nagoya, Japan). HeLa, Caco-2, and Sawano cells were purchased from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Normal uterus smooth muscle cells (UtSMCs) and SmGM medium (specific medium for UtSMCs) were obtained from BioWhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Cell Culture—HeLa and Sawano cells were cultured in 2 mm glutamine-containing minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 and 15% FBS, respectively. Caco-2 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 2 mm glutamine. UtSMCs were incubated in SmGM medium. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. Parasporin-1 Purification—Pro-parasporin-1 was activated with trypsin, and parasporin-1 was purified as reported previously (10Katayama H. Yokota H. Akao T. Nakamura O. Ohba M. Mekada E. Mizuki E. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, samples were digested with trypsin without phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride treatment before being fractionated by affinity chromatography on a Hi-trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was eluted by washing with Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions were pooled and fractionated again on a Superdex 75 pg column (bed volume 1.6 × 65 cm). Fractions containing the cytotoxic activity of parasporin-1 were pooled and purified further by chromatofocusing on a Mono P HR 5/20 column (Amersham Biosciences). Parasporin-1 was eluted using a linear gradient from pH 8 to 7 by washing with 10% (v/v) polybuffer 96-HCl (pH 7.0). Finally, parasporin-1 was purified with a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and 150 mm NaCl). Purified parasporin-1 was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10-20% gradient gels (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar), and protein bands were detected with silver staining (12Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the electrophoresis results for the final fractions of purified parasporin-1, which contained 15- and 56-kDa proteins. The purified parasporin-1 samples were used throughout the experiments described in this article. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lactate Dehydrogenase Release Assay—The ability of purified parasporin-1 to cause lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was evaluated using HeLa cells. After the trypsinized HeLa cells were suspended in the culture medium at a density of 2.2 × 105 cell/ml, 90 μl of the suspension was dispensed into each well of a 96-well plate (2 × 104 cells/well). After 16 h, the HeLa cells were treated with parasporin-1 (10 μg/ml) or SLO (2 μg/ml). LDH activity was measured using a CytoTox 96 assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative value (%) of LDH release was obtained by comparing the activity measured in the samples to a maximal value, which was obtained after freeze-thaw lysing of HeLa cells. Propidium Iodide Influx Assay—HeLa cells were cultured for 16 h in a 96-well plate at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well. After cells were washed three times with Hanks‘-HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1.2 mm CaCl2, 136 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mm MgSO4, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, and 5.55 mm glucose), they were incubated for 10 min with Hanks‘-HEPES buffer containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI). After the addition of parasporin-1 or SLO, PI entry was monitored by measuring the increase in fluorescence intensity at 612 nm upon excitation at 485 nm, using a FLEX station (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescence intensity was measured every 30 s. The fluorescent signals were normalized to the maximal fluorescent signal obtained following the addition of 1% Triton X-100. Membrane Potential Measurements—HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well, black-wall microplates (Corning Inc.) at a density of 2.0 × 104 cells/well and cultured at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were washed three times with Hanks‘-HEPES buffer and were incubated with Hanks‘-HEPES buffer containing DiSC3(5) (200 nm) for 30 min in a CO2 incubator. Cells were excited at 625 nm, and the intensity of the light emitted at 670 nm was measured every 30 s. The base-line level of fluorescence was determined during the initial 3 min of the FLEX station read. Parasporin-1 or SLO was then added to each well and the subsequent changes in the fluorescence intensity of DiSC3(5) were monitored. Maximal depolarization was obtained at the end of each experiment by adding premixed valinomycin and nigericin to the final concentrations of 2 and 5 μm, respectively (13Krause K.H. Fivaz M. Monod A. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18122-18129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed at 37 °C. Cytotoxic Assay—HeLa cells were precultured under the same conditions used for the LDH release assay. After the preculture, the diluted sample of parasporin-1 (10 μl) was added to the culture medium. After a 20-h incubation, the cells were observed under a phase-contrast microscope to estimate the cytotoxicity and were subjected to an MTS assay to measure cell viability in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). For the calculation of cell viability, the absorbance (590 nm) of HeLa cells treated with 10 μg/ml parasporin-1 in the MTS assay was used as a background value. After subtraction of the background value from the value for each sample, cell viability was calculated as the absorbance value at 590 nm relative to the blank value (100%). The effect of extracellular Ca2+ on parasporin-1 toxicity was measured in low-Ca2+ and normal Ca2+ media (10% FBS, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and 2 mm glutamine in Ca2+-free DMEM or DMEM, respectively). The Ca2+ concentration of FBS was determined to be 3.4 mm using the laboratory test reagent Calcium E-test (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Therefore, the Ca2+ concentrations of normal and low-Ca2+ media were ∼2.1 and 0.3 mm, respectively. HeLa cells were precultured in normal or low-Ca2+ medium and then were treated with parasporin-1 (0-10 μg/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C. The viability of the HeLa cells was determined as described above. Protein and DNA Synthesis Measurements—To measure cellular protein synthesis, HeLa cells were seeded on 12-well tissue culture plates (7.3 × 104 cells/well) and cultured for 20 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After the cells were twice washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.75 ml of assay medium (Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml ampicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) was added. After incubation with parasporin-1 (2.5 μg/ml) for the indicated times, cells were incubated with 380 kBq/ml [3H]leucine for 10 min in assay medium. For blocking of [3H]leucine incorporation, 1.5 mg/ml leucine was added (final concentration 0.75 mg/ml). After the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, they were lysed with 0.2 n NaOH and treated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity incorporated into proteins was then determined. The rate of protein synthesis is expressed as a percentage of the value obtained from control cultures that did not receive parasporin-1. DNA synthesis was assessed by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. After incubation of HeLa cells with 2.5 μg/ml parasporin-1 for the indicated times, HeLa cells were incubated with 380 kBq/ml [3H]thymidine in assay medium for 10 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 20% trichloroacetic acid after lysis with 0.2 N NaOH. The amount of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity incorporated into DNA was determined. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentrations—HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well black-wall microplates at a density of 2.0 × 104 cells/well and cultured at 37 °C for 20 h. The cells were washed three times in wash buffer (Ca2+-free Hanks'-HEPES buffer containing 2.5 mm probenecid and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) and then were loaded with the intracellular Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator Fura-2/AM (4.5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in dye-loading buffer (Hanks'-HEPES buffer containing 2.5 mm probenecid, 1% (v/v) FBS, and 0.05% Pluronic F-127). After being washed three times with wash buffer, cells were incubated in assay buffer (Hanks'-HEPES buffer containing 2.5 mm probenecid and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for an additional 15 min at 37 °C in the measurement equipment to allow for hydrolysis of the acetoxymethyl ester. The fluorescence emitted at 510 nm after excitation with a wavelength that alternated between 340 and 380 nm was recorded every 30 s using a fluorometric plate reader (FLEX station, Molecular Devices). Base-line intracellular fluorescence was established during the initial 180 s of the FLEX station reading. Parasporin-1 was then added to each well, and subsequent changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration were monitored. These experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Calibration of the maximal fluorescence signals (Rmax) was determined by sequential addition of ionomycin (1 μm) and calcium (2 mm), and that of the minimal fluorescence signals (Rmin) was obtained by treating the cells with Triton X-100 (1%) followed by the addition of EGTA (25 mm). The intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) concentration was calculated according to Grynkiewicz et al. (14Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the equation [Ca2+]i concentration = Kd × [(R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R)] × (Sf2/Sb2), where Kd is the dissociation constant (224 nm for Fura-2) and Sf2/Sb2 is the ratio of the fluorescent intensity of the Ca2+-free indictor to the fluorescent intensity of the Ca2+-bound indictor measured with excitation at 380 nm. Western Blot Analysis—After treatment with parasporin-1, cells were washed with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 137 mm NaCl) and were fixed in TBS containing 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h at 4°C. For total protein extraction, fixed cells were suspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 2mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol). The protein concentrations in the resulting lysates were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Sigma). Lysates containing 5 μg of protein were resolved on a 12% acrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk and were then incubated with the different antibodies in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5% skim milk. Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for detection of the protein bands. Effects of Parasporin-1 on HeLa Cell Membrane Permeability—Some bacterial toxins, including B. thuringiensis Cry toxin, form pores in the plasma membranes of target cells, thereby increasing membrane permeability, K+ efflux, and membrane depolarization (13Krause K.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15736-15740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To test whether or not parasporin-1 affects membrane permeability, a LDH leakage assay and a PI influx assay were performed. Parasporin-1 did not induce the release of LDH from HeLa cells, whereas SLO, a membrane pore-forming toxin from Streptococcus pyogenes, induced LDH release within 30 min (Fig. 2A). PI influx assays also demonstrated that parasporin-1 does not affect membrane permeability; SLO, but not parasporin-1, induced PI influx (Fig. 2B). To examine whether parasporin-1 induces plasma membrane depolarization, we analyzed the effects of parasporin-1 on the membrane potential of treated cells using the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescence probe DiSC3(5), which has been widely used for this purpose (19Papini E. Sandona D. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3353-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When SLO was added to HeLa cell cultures, a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity was observed, indicating that membranes of the cells were depolarized (Fig. 2C, right panel). On the other hand, the fluorescence intensity barely increased after treatment with 10 μg/ml parasporin-1 (Fig. 2C, left panel). These results indicate that parasporin-1 does not form pores in the plasma membrane or induce membrane depolarization. Inhibition of Cellular Protein and DNA Syntheses by Parasporin-1—The effects of parasporin-1 on the synthesis of cellular proteins and DNA were examined. Although the level of protein synthesis in parasporin-1-treated HeLa cells was about 25% of that in control samples (Fig. 3A), the time course of parasporin-1 inhibition was quite different from those of other toxins that inhibit the protein synthesis machinery, such as diphtheria toxin and ricin toxin, which enter the cytoplasm after binding to the plasma membrane. Diphtheria toxin inhibits cellular protein synthesis after a 30-min lag period, which is the time it takes the toxic moiety to reach the cytosol (20Uchida T. Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Harper A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3845-3850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, parasporin-1 inhibited protein synthesis soon after its addition to the medium (Fig. 3A). Similarly, partial inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed immediately after the addition of parasporin-1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that parasporin-1 exerts its toxic effects quickly by a process that does not require the entry of parasporin-1 into the cellular cytoplasm. Parasporin-1 Induces Ca2+ Influx and a Sustained Elevation of Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration in Tox-in-sensitive Cells—The nature of parasporin-1 cytotoxicity, i.e. rapid action without a lag time and partial inhibition of DNA and protein synthesis, implied that parasporin-1 may affect the cells by enhancing or suppressing the levels of intracellular second messengers through the binding of this toxin to the cell surface. Because trimeric GTP-binding proteins are often targets of bacterial toxins, intracellular levels of cAMP and Ca2+ were measured in cells treated with parasporin-1. No alterations of the intracellular cAMP levels, which were quantified by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were observed after a 2-h treatment with parasporin-1 (5 μg/ml) (data not shown). In contrast, intracellular Ca2+ levels were markedly elevated when HeLa cells were treated with parasporin-1. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured using Fura-2, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. After loading HeLa cells with Fura-2/AM, the cells were treated with various concentrations of parasporin-1 (0-10 μg/ml) and the [Ca2+]i concentration was estimated from the fluorescence intensity. The [Ca2+]i concentration increased soon after the addition of parasporin-1 (within 3 min) in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4A). The elevation of [Ca2+]i levels can be achieved in two different ways: release from an intracellular storage site or influx from the extracellular environment (21Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 22Claphan D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism underlying the parasporin-1-induced elevation of the [Ca2+]i concentration, the parasporin-1-induced Ca2+ increase was measured in cells maintained in a Ca2+-free buffer. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, parasporin-1 increased [Ca2+]i levels, as shown in Fig. 4A. In Ca2+-free buffer, however, parasporin-1 did not induce an elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ level (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that parasporin-1 promotes Ca2+ influx from the extracellular buffer. In a previous study, we showed that parasporin-1 is a highly cell type-specific cytotoxin (10Katayama H. Yokota H. Akao T. Nakamura O. Ohba M. Mekada E. Mizuki E. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To examine whether the parasporin-1-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels correlated with the cytotoxicity of this protein, the effect of parasporin-1 on the elevation of the [Ca2+]i concentration was examined using four cell lines that have different sensitivities to parasporin-1 (Fig. 5A). HeLa cells, which had the highest sensitivity to parasporin-1 among these four cell lines, showed the largest toxin-induced elevation of the [Ca2+]i concentration (Fig. 4A). Caco-2 cells, the least parasporin-1-senstive cell line, did not show an increase in the [Ca2+]i concentration following parasporin-1 treatment (Fig. 5B). Sawano cells, which are less sensitive to parasporin-1 than HeLa cells, showed a moderate increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level (Fig. 5C). Finally, although the increase in the [Ca2+]i level in UtSMCs (which are less sensitive to parasporin-1 than Sawano cells) induced by 10 μg/ml parasporin-1 was comparable with that observed in Sawano cells, the increase induced by 1 μg/ml parasporin-1 was significantly smaller in UtSMCs than in Sawano cells (Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, A549 cells, which have a parasporin-1 sensitivity similar to that of UtSMCs, showed an increase in the [Ca2+]i concentration that was similar to that observed in UtSMCs (data not shown). Thus, the degree of the increase in the [Ca2+]i level induced by parasporin-1 was well correlated with the sensitivities of the cell lines to parasporin-1. Involvement of Extracellular Ca2+ in the Cytotoxicity of Parasporin-1—[Ca2+]i levels are tightly regulated by store-operated and capacitative calcium entry mechanisms (23Putney J Jr W.

Disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, which leads to a high concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+, induces cell injury and cell death (28Trump B.F. Berrezesky I.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). We speculated that the toxicity of parasporin-1 may be caused by the unusual increase in the [Ca2+]i concentration. To examine this possibility, cells were treated with parasporin-1 in Ca2+-depleted conditions, and cell viability and the [Ca2+]i concentration were measured. When HeLa cells were treated with parasporin-1 in low-Ca2+ medium (∼0.3 mm Ca2+), parasporin-1 was markedly less cytotoxic than when normal medium was used (∼2.1 mm Ca2+) (Fig. 6A). The rise in the [Ca2+]i concentration induced by parasporin-1 was smaller in assay buffer containing 0.3 mm CaCl2 than in assay buffer containing 2.1 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 6"
https://openalex.org/W2007626445,"Multifarious transcription of the adhesion protein ap65-1 gene in the human pathogen, Trichomonas vaginalis, is critically regulated by the coordination of two similar but opposite oriented DNA regulatory regions, MRE-1/MRE-2r and MRE-2f, both of which are binding sites for multiple Myb-like proteins. In the present study, MRE-1/MRE-2r was demonstrated to be composed of multiple overlapping promoter elements, among which the entire region is required for growth-related ap65-1 transcription, and the 5′-MRE-1 antagonizes the suppressive activity of the 3′-MRE-2r in iron-inducible transcription. The recombinant Myb2 protein derived from a previously identified myb2 gene was demonstrated to recognize distinct sequence contexts in MRE-2r and MRE-2f, whereas Myb2 in the nuclear lysate preferentially binds to MRE-2f to MRE-2r. Iron repletion resulted in persistent repression of the myb2 gene, and temporal activation/deactivation of Myb2 promoter entry, which was also activated by prolonged iron depletion. The hemagglutinintagged Myb2 when overexpressed during iron-depleted conditions facilitated basal and growth-related ap65-1 transcription to a level that was achieved in iron-replete cells, whereas ironinducible ap65-1 transcription was abolished with knockdown of Myb2. These findings demonstrated that Myb2 is involved in activation of growth-related and iron-inducible transcription of the ap65-1 gene, possibly through differential promoter selection in competition with other Myb proteins.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite that causes the most common sexually transmitted disease of nonviral origin in humans. The disease poses an imminent threat to public health as revealed by recent findings that transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus increases in patients with trichomoniasis (1Sorvillo F. Smith L. Kerndt P. Ash L. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2001; 7: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The parasite persistently inhabits the human urogenital tract without an alternating life stage outside of the host. Cytoadherence, which is crucial for T. vaginalis to establish an infection, has been shown to involve multiple surface adhesion proteins and lipophosphoglycans (2Alderete J.F. Milsap K.W. Lehker M.W.

The iron supply, which undergoes periodic fluctuations in the human vagina, is one of the principle determinants modulating cytoadherence of the parasite toward human vaginal epithelial cells (5Garcia A.F.

Iron has also been implicated in modulating phenotypic variation of the parasite as well as its resistance to complement lysis (11Alderete J.F. Provenzano D. Lehker H.W. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 19: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Alderete J.F. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4298-4302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations underscore the importance of iron in modulating expression of parasite virulence. Gene transcription in T. vaginalis is monocistronic with only a few intron-containing genes capable of undergoing RNA splicing (13Vanacova S. Yan W. Calton J.M. Johnson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4430-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II is thus a key step in controlling expression of the protein coding genes in the parasite. Using transcription of the ap65-1 gene as a model system, we have been studying transcription machinery that controls parasitic gene expression in coping with rapid changes in the growth environment (14Tsai C.D.

The ap65-1 promoter was demonstrated to comprise a simple core promoter that only contains a ubiquitous initiator element spanning the transcription initiation site (+1) (14Tsai C.D. Liu H.W.

Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter region contains eight closely spaced promoter elements (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), among which three Myb recognition elements (MRE), MRE-1/MRE-2r which overlap, and MRE-2f, are the binding sites for several Myb-like DNA binding transcription factors (14Tsai C.D. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol.

The promoter distal region, which is essential for optimal promoter activity, 3J. H. Tai, unpublished observations.3J. H. Tai, unpublished observations. also contains two additional clusters of MRE-1/MRE-2r- and MRE-2f-like DNA sequences (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The MRE-1/MRE-2r and MRE-2f regions share similar but opposite oriented DNA sequences, ATAACGATA and TATCGTC, respectively, each of which is also the binding site for multiple nuclear DNA-binding proteins (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Both DNA regions are required for optimal growth-related transcription, but MRE-1/MRE-2r counteracts MRE-2f positive action on iron-inducible transcription (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Southwestern screening of a T. vaginalis cDNA expression library revealed two MRE-2f-binding protein genes, myb1 and myb2, which encode 24-kDa and 21-kDa open reading frames, respectively (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Myb1 protein displays dual DNA binding specificity with higher affinity binding to MRE-1/MRE-2r than to MRE-2f. Myb1, when overexpressed in the transgenic parasite to a level similar to endogenous Myb1, can differentially select three defined sites, each of which contains a cluster of MRE-1/MRE-2r- and MRE-2f-like elements (see Fig. 7A), in the ap65-1 promoter in a growth-related manner, and repress basal or iron-inducible, but enhance growth-related, ap65-1 transcription (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the MRE-1/MRE-2r regulatory region is composed of multiple overlapping promoter elements, and that the entire region is required for growth-related activity, while 5′-MRE-1 antagonizes the suppressive activity of 3′-MRE-2r on iron-inducible activity of the ap65-1 promoter. The Myb2 protein encoded by the myb2 gene was found to interact with specific sequence contexts spanning MRE-2r and MRE-2f and which are distinct from those recognized by Myb1. Further biochemical and functional studies suggested that Myb2 is involved in activation of both iron-inducible and growth-related transcription of the ap65-1 gene. Information derived from the current study will be useful for further elucidating signaling pathways and regulatory circuits potentially leading to iron-inducible gene regulation in T. vaginalis. Cultures—T. vaginalis T1 cells were maintained as previously described (14Tsai C.D. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Iron repletion or depletion was achieved with the addition of 250 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate or 50 μm of an iron-chelator, 2, 2′-dipyridyl, respectively, in growth medium. A WT-13 cell line harboring a reporter plasmid, pAP65-1luc+/TUBneo, for the activity assay of the ap65-1 promoter was obtained from a previous study (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DNA Transfection and Selection for Stable Transfectants—Plasmid DNA was electroporated into T. vaginalis for paromomycin selection of stable transfectants as previously described (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Promoter Assay—Stable cell lines harboring the mutated reporter plasmid, pAPm(MRE-1) or pAPm(MRE-2r) (see below), are referred to as m(MRE-1) or m(MRE-2r), respectively. Luciferase activity in stable cells conferred by the expression of the luc+ reporter gene was measured as previously described (14Tsai C.D. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the promoter assay, relative amounts of respective plasmids in cells from individual cell lines were determined by dot hybridization as previously described (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and their promoter activities were normalized accordingly. Oligonucleotides—Sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the present study are either listed in Table 1 or were reported in a previous study (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H.

Open table in a new tab Cloning of the Genomic myb2 Gene—A T. vaginalis T1 genomic DNA library and a partial cDNA sequence of the myb2 gene were obtained from a previous study (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The sequence flanking 5′-end of the myb2 gene was amplified from the genomic DNA library by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primer pair, T3 and myb2-3′-2. The amplified DNA was then cloned into pGEM_Teasy for DNA sequencing as described by the supplier (Promega). Construction of Plasmids—The plasmid, pAP65-1luc+/TUBneo (Fig. 1A), was obtained from a previous study (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A 5′-PCR product was amplified from pAP65-1luc+/TUBneo using tub90f as the 5′-primer and a 3′-antisense primer, m(-95/-94)-3′ or m(-89/-88)-3′, at the target site to create mutations in MRE-1 or MRE-2r, respectively. A 3′-PCR product was amplified from pAP65-1luc+/TUBneo using a 5′-primer, m(-95/-94)-5′ or m(-89/-88)-5′, at the target site and luc344r as the 3′-primer. The 5′ and 3′ PCR products were purified and mixed as templates for second round of the PCR using the primer pair tub90f and luc344r. The mutated plasmid, pAPm(MRE-1) or pAPm(MRE-2r), was obtained by replacing the SacII/HindIII fragment in pAP65-1luc+/TUB-neo with the final PCR product predigested with SacII and HindIII. To construct a gene overexpression system, a DNA fragment spanning the coding region of the myb2 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primer pair ha-myb2-5′nde1 and myb2-3′bgl2, and was then cloned into pGEM_Teasy to generate pTA-ha-myb2. A DNA fragment spanning the 5′-untranslated region (-324/+22) of the ap65-2 gene (9Alderete J.F. O'Brien J.L. Arroyo R. Engbring J.A. Musatovova O. Lopez O. Lauriano C. Nguyen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was amplified using the primer pair, ap65-2.1-5′sac2 and ap65-2-3′nde1, and was then cloned into pGEM_Teasy to generate pTA-AP65-2.1. A DNA fragment spanning the 3′-untranslated region of the ap65-1 gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using the primer pair, ap65-1-3′utr-blg2 and ap65-1-3′utr-nsi1. The DNA fragment was cloned into pGEM_Teasy to generate pTA-AP65-1-3′utr. The SacII/NdeI fragment from pTA-AP65-2.1, the NdeI/BglII fragment from pTA-ha-myb2, and the BglII/NsiI fragment from pTA-AP65-1-3′utr were cloned into pAP65-1luc+/TUBneo predigested with SacII and NsiI to generate the HA-Myb2 expression plasmid, pAP65-2.1-ha-myb2/TUBneo (Fig. 5A). To construct an antisense gene knockdown system, a DNA fragment spanning the coding region of the myb2 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using a forward primer, αs-myb2-3′nde1 and a reverse primer, αs-myb2-5′bgl2, and was then cloned into pGEM_Teasy to generate pTAαs-myb2. The plasmid, pAP65-2.1-αs-myb2/TUBneo, was generated by replacing the NdeI/BglII fragment in pAP65-2.1-ha-myb2/TUBneo with the NdeI/BglII fragment from pTAαs-myb2 (Fig. 6A). To express recombinant protein, the coding region of the myb2 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primer pair lic-myb2-5′ and lic-myb2-3′. The plasmid, pET30/Myb2, was generated by ligation of the PCR product with pET30 using a pET30EK/LIC vector kit as suggested by the supplier (Novagen). Northern Hybridization—Cellular RNA was extracted from T. vaginalis using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and mRNA was purified using oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography. Probe labeling and Northern hybridization were performed as previously described (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The [α-32P]dCTP-labeled myb2 DNA probe was synthesized from a pTAha-myb2 template. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—A semiquantitative RT-PCR assay was performed to examine expression levels of ap65-1, β-tubulin, and myb2 transcripts in total RNA as previously described (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The myb2 cDNA was amplified using the primer pair myb2-173f and myb2-3′utr, and was annealed at 55 °C. Expression of the Recombinant Myb2 Protein (rMyb2)—The rMyb2 protein expression vector, pET30/Myb2, was transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21-Codon Plus DE3-RIL strain (Stratagene) for the production of rMyb2. E. coli transformed with pET30/Myb2 in shaking cultures was incubated at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6. The induction was performed with the addition of 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 2 h. Under these conditions, the majority of rMyb2 was determined to be in the inclusion bodies (see Fig. 4A). Soluble rMyb2 was purified using a His-bind nickel column as described by the supplier (Novagen). Antibody Production—Purified rMyb2 was used for rabbit immunization by a standard protocol (18Harlow E. Land D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 92-119Google Scholar), and antiserum was purified by protein A affinity chromatography as described by the supplier (Sigma). Western Blotting—Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of T. vaginalis total lysate were prepared for the Western blotting and DNA binding assay described below using a cellular fractionation kit, NE-PER™, as described by the supplier (Pierce). In some of the experiments, a semiquantitative Western blot assay using serially diluted protein samples from lysate equivalent to 105 ∼ 106 cells was performed as previously described (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ECL system was used for signal detection as instructed by the supplier (Pierce). Reaction conditions for antibodies from commercial sources, including the mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (5,000×) (DM1A, Sigma), rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (2,000×) (3F10, Roche Applied Science), and His6 monoclonal antibody (10,000×) (Clontech), were as described by the supplier. The Myb2 and AP65 proteins were detected using a rabbit anti-Myb2 antibody (2,000×) and mouse monoclonal anti-malic enzyme antibody 15D7 (19Brugerolle G. Bricheux G. Coffe G. Parasitol. Res. 2000; 86: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (10,000×), respectively. Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)—Subcellular localization of HA-Myb2 or the NEO selective marker was performed by IFA using a mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (200×) (HA-7, Sigma) or rabbit anti-NPT-II antibody (800×) (Upstate) as previously described (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Probe labeling and EMSA were performed as previously described (14Tsai C.D. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), except that in some of the binding reactions, the serially diluted anti-Myb2 antibody or normal rabbit serum was included. Signal intensity of the 32P isotope was measured using a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—A ChIP assay was performed as previously described (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In some of the reactions, an aliquot of supernatant recovered from the DNA shearing step was reacted with 20 μl of the anti-Myb2 antibody or normal rabbit serum followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-agarose (Sigma). The DNA fragment spanning region I, II, or III of the β-tubulin promoter was amplified by PCR using primer pairs tub-1f and tub-1r, tub-2f and tub2-r, or tub-3f and tub-3r, respectively. Overlapping DNA Elements in MRE-1/MRE-2r—The DNA sequence, ATAACGATA, spanning the MRE-1/MRE-2r overlap was found to be composed of three distinct nuclear protein-binding sites, ANAACGAT for Myb1 (16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and TAACGA (MRE-1) and CGATA (MRE-2r) for the reputed MRE-1-binding protein (MRE-1-BP) and MRE-2r-binding protein, respectively (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To study whether MRE-1/MRE-2r comprises multiple, functionally distinct promoter elements in vivo, site-directed mutagenesis of the ap65-1 promoter was conducted using a reporter plasmid, pAP65-1luc+/TUBneo, and two related mutant plasmids (Fig. 1). The mutation of MRE-1 that retains intact MRE-2r resulted in diminished growth-related ap65-1 promoter activity from the original 15-fold to 2-fold, but without an effect on basal activity. The iron-inducible activity was also diminished from the original 6-fold to 2-fold. By contrast, only ∼20% of the original basal as well as growth-related ap65-1 promoter activity was detected in the mutation of MRE-2r that retains intact MRE-1, and the iron-inducible activity was activated to 24-fold from the original 6-fold. Consistent with the nuclear protein binding specificities (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Ong S.J. Hsu H.M. Liu H.W. Chu C.H. Tai J.H. Eukaryot Cell. 2006; 5: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the MRE-1/MRE-2r region is composed of multiple overlapping promoter elements, which display intricate relationship in regulating multifarious ap65-1 transcription. Iron Repressive Expression of the myb2 Gene—The myb2 gene encodes an open reading frame of 176 amino acid residues, with a size estimated to be 21 kDa and a PI value of 8.01. Myb2 shares little homology with Myb1 in the protein sequence outside of the conserved R2R3 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 2A). Even in this conserved domain (∼60% similarity), only three out of eight base-contacting amino acid residues identified in the mammalian cMyb (21Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) were identical between the protein sequences of Myb1 and Myb2 (Fig. 2B). The myb2 gene was expressed as a 0.6-kb mRNA species in T. vaginalis as revealed by Northern hybridization (Fig. 3A). The expression level of myb2 mRNA under iron-replete conditions was 2-fold lower than that under iron-depleted conditions as examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). The expression level slightly varied in an 18-h period. The expression level of β-tubulin mRNA remained constant under all test conditions. A major 27-kDa band and several faster migrating minor bands with sizes between 21 and 25 kDa were detected in cell lysate from T. vaginalis by Western blotting using the anti-Myb2 antibody (Fig. 3, C and D). The 27-kDa band was distributed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions to similar extents, but those faster migrating ones were only detected in the cytoplasmic fractions even when samples were overloaded to increase detection sensitivity (Fig. 3C). The purity of these cellular fractions was examined using an antibody against a cytosolic malic enzyme (22Dolezal P. Vanacova S. Tachezy J. Hrdy I. Genes. 2004; 329: 81-92Google Scholar) or α-tubulin that detected a 50-kDa band only in the cytoplasmic fractions or a 55-kDa band only in the nuclear fractions, respectively. None of these protein bands was detected on a duplicate blot either using preimmune serum or the anti-Myb2 antibody that had been pre-adsorbed with purified rMyb2 (data not shown). The cellular distribution of Myb2 as examined by semiquantitative Western blotting only slightly varied under our test conditions (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the RNA analysis (Fig. 3B), the signal intensity of the 27-kDa protein in samples from iron-replete cells was also 2-fold lower than that in samples from iron-depleted cells. DNA Binding Specificity of Myb2—The rMyb2 protein was purified (Fig. 4A) for use in EMSA. rMyb2 at as little as 2.5 ng was sufficient to form a major complex with the MRE-1/MRE-2r-containing [32P]IR probe (Fig. 4B, left panel), and two discernible DNA-protein complexes with the MRE-2f-containing [32P]IR3′ probe (Fig. 4B, right panel), with similar activities. The DNA binding specificity of rMyb2 against [32P]IR was then tested in competition assays using a 250× molar excess of the cold IR or mutated sequences of the mIR series (Fig. 4C) as previously described (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complex was incompletely competed to various degrees with various mutant competitors. Similar results were observed in the reactions with [32P]IR3′ in the competition assays (Fig. 4D). The signal intensity of the DNA-protein complexes in individual reactions was measured, revealing that CGATA, which resembles the target site of the reputed MRE-2r-binding proteins (15Ong S.J. Huang S.C. Liu H.W. Tai J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and tAtCGTc spanning MRE-2f are the primary binding sites (upper and lowercase letters indicate strong or weak contact sites, respectively) of rMyb2. The DNA binding activity of Myb2 in the nuclear lysate was then examined. Two DNA-protein complexes (I and II) were detected in the binding reactions including 10 μg of nuclear proteins and either [32P]IR or [32P]IR3′ (Fig. 4, E and F, respectively). Co-incubation with the serially diluted anti-Myb2 antibody only resulted in disruption of complex I in each binding reaction to a level dependent on the serum concentration, indicating that Myb2 is only one of the nuclear proteins targeting MRE-1/MRE-2r or MRE-2f. This interference effect was not observed with co-incubation of serially diluted normal rabbit serum. The signal intensity of the Myb2-DNA complex in the binding reactions revealed that nuclear Myb2 bound 6-fold as much [32P]IR as [32P]IR3′ (Fig. 4G), suggesting that nuclear Myb2 preferentially binds MRE-2f over MRE-2r. HA-Myb2 Overexpression—The HA-Myb2 expression plasmid, pAP65-2.1ha-myb2/TUBneo (Fig. 5A), was used to overexpress a HA-tagged Myb2 protein in T. vaginalis. The HA signal was primarily detected in nuclei of more than 95% of transfected cells, but in none of the non-tra"
https://openalex.org/W2153767510,"Using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, we identified the tumor suppressor gene maspin as a transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) target gene in human mammary epithelial cells. TGFbeta up-regulatesMaspin expression both at the RNA and protein levels. This up-regulation required Smad2/3 function and intact p53-binding elements in the Maspin promoter. DNA affinity immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the presence of both Smads and p53 at the Maspin promoter in TGFbeta-treated cells, suggesting that both transcription factors cooperate to induce Maspin transcription. TGFbeta did not activate Maspin-luciferase reporter in p53-mutant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which exhibit methylation of the endogenous Maspin promoter. Expression of ectopic p53, however, restored ligand-induced association of Smad2/3 with a transfected Maspin promoter. Stable transfection of Maspin inhibited basal and TGFbeta-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cell motility. Finally, knockdown of endogenous Maspin in p53 wild-type MCF10A/HER2 cells enhanced basal and TGFbeta-stimulated motility. Taken together, these data support cooperation between the p53 and TGFbeta tumor suppressor pathways in the induction of Maspin expression, thus leading to inhibition of cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2022682859,"The recent finding of an interaction between calmodulin (CaM) and the tobacco mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (NtMKP1) establishes an important connection between Ca2+ signaling and the MAPK cascade, two of the most important signaling pathways in plant cells. Here we have used different biophysical techniques, including fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy as well as microcalorimetry, to characterize the binding of soybean CaM isoforms, SCaM-1 and -4, to synthetic peptides derived from the CaM binding domain of NtMKP1. We find that the actual CaM binding region is shorter than what had previously been suggested. Moreover, the peptide binds to the SCaM C-terminal domain even in the absence of free Ca2+ with the single Trp residue of the NtMKP1 peptides buried in a solvent-inaccessible hydrophobic region. In the presence of Ca2+, the peptides bind first to the C-terminal lobe of the SCaMs with a nanomolar affinity, and at higher peptide concentrations, a second peptide binds to the N-terminal domain with lower affinity. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the formation of the peptide-bound complex with the Ca2+-loaded SCaMs is driven by favorable binding enthalpy due to a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Experiments with CaM proteolytic fragments showed that the two domains bind the peptide in an independent manner. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing direct evidence for sequential binding of two identical peptides of a target protein to CaM.

To our knowledge, this is the first report providing direct evidence for sequential binding of two identical peptides of a target protein to CaM. Discussion of the potential biological role of this interaction motif is also provided. The calcium ion (Ca2+) is one of the most important signaling messengers in both animals (1Carafoli E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1073-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and plants (2Reddy V.S. Reddy A.S. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 1745-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). At the resting level, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in cells is ∼100 nm, whereas the level of Ca2+ in the intracellular stores and extracellular fluid is in the high micromolar to millimolar range. In response to a variety of stimuli, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration rapidly increases and then quickly returns to the basal level. During this spike, Ca2+ binds to a variety of Ca2+-binding proteins, some of which are simply involved in Ca2+ storage, whereas others regulate target enzymes. One of the most important regulatory Ca2+-binding proteins in the cytosol is CaM 4The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SCaM, soybean calmodulin; CaMBD, CaM binding domain; mCaM, mammalian calmodulin; mTR1C, proteolytic fragment 1–77 of mCaM; mTR2C, proteolytic fragment 78–148 of mCaM; S1N, proteolytic fragment 1–75 of SCaM-1; S1C, proteolytic fragments 76–148 and 78–148 of SCaM-1; S4C, proteolytic fragments 77–149 and 79–149 of SCaM-4; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence.4The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SCaM, soybean calmodulin; CaMBD, CaM binding domain; mCaM, mammalian calmodulin; mTR1C, proteolytic fragment 1–77 of mCaM; mTR2C, proteolytic fragment 78–148 of mCaM; S1N, proteolytic fragment 1–75 of SCaM-1; S1C, proteolytic fragments 76–148 and 78–148 of SCaM-1; S4C, proteolytic fragments 77–149 and 79–149 of SCaM-4; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence.

Plant Biol. 2005; 56: 435-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). CaM is a small (148 amino acids), α-helical protein containing four helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motifs commonly known as EF-hands, which are equally distributed between the two distinct N- and C-terminal globular domains. These two domains are connected by a linker that is flexible in solution, as revealed by NMR studies (5Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 6Ikura M. Spera S. Barbato G. Kay L.E. Krinks M. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9216-9228Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). At the resting Ca2+ level, CaM is in a Ca2+-free state (apo-CaM) with the hydrophobic region of both domains almost completely buried (this is usually referred as the “closed conformation”). Upon binding Ca2+, the α-helices within both domains change their relative orientation, exposing Met-rich hydrophobic patches (the “open conformation”), which CaM uses to bind to its target enzymes (7Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In the most common binding mode, both the N- and C-domains of CaM are involved, forming a collapsed complex by wrapping around the target peptide (8Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). However, several different binding modes have been recently reported, revealing that CaM can also bind to targets in unusual compact or extended conformations (9Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 10Vetter S.W. Leclerc E. Eur. J.

Lett. 2006; 13: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an increasing number of interactions between apo-CaM and target proteins and peptides have been reported (13Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 14Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).CaM binding domains (CaMBDs) are generally small, contiguous amino acid sequences of ∼25 amino acids in length, containing a large number of basic and hydrophobic residues and having the propensity to form an amphiphilic α-helix (12Ishida H. Vogel H.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An important feature is the presence of two hydrophobic “anchor” residues, such as Trp or Phe, or a bulky aliphatic residue, such as Leu, usually spaced either 9 or 13 residues apart (11Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. Mol. Biotechnol. 2004; 27: 33-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 16Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The two anchor residues “dock” the helical peptide in the hydrophobic clefts of the two globular domains determining their relative orientation and the extent of uncoiling of the central linker (17Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 18Yamauchi E. Nakatsu T. Matsubara M. Kato H. Taniguchi H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To simplify the study of the CaM interactions, chemically synthesized peptides comprising the CaMBD are normally used instead of the large intact enzymes (19Chin D. Sloan D.J. Quiocho F.A. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5510-5513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Gomes A.V. Barnes J.A. Vogel H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been shown that this system is an excellent mimetic for the interaction of CaM with the whole enzyme (21Kranz J.K. Lee E.K. Nairn A.C. Wand A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16351-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These CaM-binding peptides are typically 20–30 amino acids long, which makes them long enough to bind simultaneously to both domains (15Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Truncated peptides with partial CaM-binding domains and missing one of the two anchor residues can sometimes form 2:1 complexes with CaM, with one peptide bound to each of the two lobes of the protein (22Zhang M.J. Vogel H.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1997; 4: 291-297Google Scholar). It has also been shown that CaM can bind to different substrates even in the absence of Ca2+. In this case, the most common CaMBD is the IQ motif (IQXXXRGXXXR), although many exceptions have been found (13Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 14Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).Although mammalian CaM (mCaM) is highly conserved, plant cells contain multiple CaM isoforms with varying degrees of sequence homology to the single mCaM. Several studies have demonstrated that the different isoforms have dissimilar stimulatory effects on some mammalian target enzymes and different expression patterns in various plant tissue types, suggesting that they play unique roles in the many different Ca2+ signaling pathways of plants (23Cho M.J. Vaghy P.L. Kondo R. Lee S.H. Davis J.P. Rehl R. Heo W.D. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15593-15597Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21806-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Another important signal transduction pathway in animals, yeasts, and plants is the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (MAPK cascade). MAPKs are implicated in developmental, hormonal, biotic, and abiotic stress signaling (25Ligterink W. Hirt H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 201: 209-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The activity of MAPKs is strictly regulated via phosphorylation of the conserved TXY motif, which is accomplished by a corresponding MAPK kinase. After activation, the dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAPKs is performed by MAPK phosphatases. In recent work, Ohashi and co-workers (26Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 928-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) identified a putative MAPK phosphatase in Nicotiana tabacum (NtMKP1) as a novel plant-specific CaM-binding protein. This result provides the first direct evidence for a molecular interaction between Ca2+-CaM and a component of the MAPK signaling cascade in plants or any other species. The CaM-binding domain was identified as a 52-amino acid sequence between the conserved gelsolin and Serrich domain in the middle of the NtMKP1 protein (Fig. 1), and Trp440 and Leu443 were identified as residues that are indispensable for the interaction with CaM (26Yamakawa H. Katou S. Seo S. Mitsuhara I. Kamada H. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 928-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In the present work, we have studied the interactions of the most conserved and the most divergent CaM isoforms from soybean, SCaM-1 and SCaM-4, respectively, as well as mCaM, with peptides derived from the CaM-binding domain of NtMKP1. The peptides were chosen based on their propensity to form amphiphatic helices, as suggested by helical wheel prediction, and on the position of the important Trp440 and Leu443 residues. Interestingly, none of the peptide sequences correspond either to the typical Ca2+-CaMBD, where the hydrophobic anchors are separated by 9 or 13 residues (15Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 16Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), or to the apo-CaMBD IQ motif. Fig. 1 illustrates the five peptides that were tested, two long peptides (23 amino acids) with Trp440 close to the N and the C terminus, respectively (NtMKP1-A and NtMKP1-B), and three short peptides, one encompassing the overlapping sequence of the two longer peptides (NtMKP1-sD) and the other two corresponding to the unique sequences of the longer peptides (NtMKP1-sC and NtMKP1-sE). The information obtained by various biophysical studies suggests that the CaMBD is bound to the C-domain of CaM even in a Ca2+-free environment. However, when either SCaM is saturated with Ca2+, each lobe of the protein is able to bind a single peptide, leading to a 1:2 overall stoichiometry. Interestingly, we found that the N- and C-domains of CaM bind to the NtMKP1 peptides with very different affinity and in an independent manner. To our knowledge, this is the first reported evidence for sequential binding of two identical target peptides to CaM.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification and Peptide Synthesis—Mammalian CaM and unlabeled and [13Cε]Met-labeled SCaMs were expressed and purified as described previously (27Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7698-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Vogel H.J. Lindahl L. Thulin E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 241-246Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mCaM proteolytic fragments mTR1C (residues 1–77) and mTR2C (residues 78–148) were produced according to the procedure described previously by Itakura and Iio (29Itakura M. Iio T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The SCaM-1 proteolytic fragments S1N (residues 1–75) and S1C (residues 76–148 and 78–148) and the isolated C-domain of SCaM-4 (S4C; residues 77–149 and 79–149) were produced according to a procedure described by Murase et al. 5T. Murase, T. Iio, and H. J. Vogel, manuscript in preparation.Protein concentrations were determined by using the BioRad protein assay kit or by using the following molar extinction coefficient: ε276(SCaM-1) = 1450 cm–1·m–1, ε276(SCaM-4) = 2900 cm–1·m–1, ε276(mCaM) = 3006 cm–1·m–1, ε259(mTR1C) = 742 cm–1·m–1, ε276(mTR2C, S1C, S4C) = 3006 cm–1·m–1.The NtMKP1-A, NtMKP1-B, NtMKP1-sC, NtMKP1-sD, and NtMKP1-sE peptides, all acetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus, were synthesized commercially by Anaspec, Inc. (San Jose, CA). Peptide purity was confirmed to be more than 95% by high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The concentration of NtMKP1-A, -B, and -sD was determined using its predicted molar extinction coefficient ε280 = 5690 cm–1·m–1, whereas NtMKP1-sC and -sE had to be weighed and dissolved in an adequate amount of solvent.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra were acquired at room temperature on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter, using an excitation bandwidth of 5 nm and an emission bandwidth of 10 nm. The lone tryptophan residue of NtMKP1 peptides was excited at 295 nm, and the fluorescence emission was measured from 300 to 450 nm. In this way, the tryptophan could be selectively excited with minimal interference from the tyrosine residues of SCaM-1 and -4 (30Yuan T. Weljie A.M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). All samples were at pH 7.3 and contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. The concentration of the NtMKP1 peptides was 10 μm. For the quenching experiments with acrylamide, the apo-SCaMs concentration was 15 μm, and the Ca2+-SCaMs concentration was 6 μm to ensure the complete saturation of the peptide. Samples were titrated with 4 μl of a 4 m acrylamide stock solution up to a final concentration of 0.1 m acrylamide. The fluorescence intensity was monitored at 355 nm for free NtMKP1 peptides and at 325 nm for the complexes and was corrected for dilution effects. The Stern-Volmer constants (Ksv) were calculated according to the equation, l0/l=Ksv[C]+1(Eq. 1) where I0 represents the fluorescence intensity in the absence of acrylamide, I is the dilution-corrected intensity observed at each titration point, and [C] is the molar acrylamide concentration. The error has been estimated as the S.D. over three measurements for the NtMKP1-A·SCaM-1 complex and has been assumed to be the same for all of the Ksv values. Binding constants were determined in 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3. The peptide concentration was 0.7 μm in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and 4 μm in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, and SCaMs aliquots were added from concentrated stock solutions. Each titration point was obtained by averaging the intensity at the maximum wavelength (λmax) of each complex over 20 scans and fitting the binding curves with Caligator software (31Andre I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using the two-site model for Ca2+ titrations and one-site model for EDTA titrations. The resulting binding constants are the average of three independent measurements. Peptide concentration and association constant influences the accuracy of the measurements. The errors calculated as S.D. values over the three measurements are <0.8 logarithmic units for the first site of Ca2+-SCaMs, <1 logarithmic unit for the second site of Ca2+-SCaMs, and <0.1 logarithmic units for apo-SCaMs.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—All isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed on a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. The procedure was similar to that described previously by Yamniuk and Vogel (27Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7698-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, both samples were dissolved in a buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH ∼ 7.5) containing KCl ranging from 0 to 200 mm and 2 mm CaCl2 for the experiment in the presence of free Ca2+ or 5 mm EDTA for those without free Ca2+. The syringe was loaded with 400–600 μm NtMKP1 peptides, and for each titration point, 4–6 μl were injected into the cell containing ∼20 μm CaM solutions at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 °C. For the SCaMs, protein dimerization through disulfide bonding was prevented by incubating each protein for 24 h in the buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and then desalting into ITC buffer without dithiothreitol using an Econo-Pac 10DG column immediately prior to ITC analysis (27Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7698-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The heat of dilution/mixing was measured in separate control experiments and subtracted in each case, and all of the data were analyzed using Microcal Origin software. For each titration, the stoichiometry (N), association constant (Ka), and enthalpy change (ΔH) were obtained directly from the data, whereas the Gibbs free energy (ΔG), entropy (ΔS), and heat capacity (ΔCp) changes were calculated from Equations 2, 3, 4, respectively. ΔG=-RTlnKa(Eq. 2) ΔG=ΔH-TΔS(Eq. 3) ΔCp=δH/δT(Eq. 4) NMR—All NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance inverse Cryoprobe with a single axis z-gradient. Samples contained 400–500 μm [13Cε]Met-SCaM-1, [13Cε]Met-SCaM-4, or [13Cε]Met-mCaM alone or in the presence of increasing amounts of NtMKP1 peptides in 100 mm KCl, 99.9% D2O, pD = 7.3 ± 0.1 (not corrected for isotope effects), and 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. For the two-dimensional 1H13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra, quadrature detection in the F1 dimension was obtained by using echo/anti-echo time-proportional phase incrementation. The sweep width in the 1H and 13C dimensions was 6009.6 and 500 Hz, respectively, and the carrier frequencies were 500.13235 and 125.7596 MHz, respectively. The size of each spectrum was a 2048 × 64 real data matrix, with four scans for each experiment.RESULTSFluorescence Spectroscopy Reveals a Different Stoichiometry in the Presence and Absence of Free Ca2+—Because CaM does not have a tryptophan residue, the fluorescent properties of Trp440 from the NtMKP1 peptides can be utilized to directly follow the peptide binding to SCaM-1 or -4. It is well known that the Trp indole ring emission is very sensitive to the different characteristics of its surroundings. When the Trp side chain in the free target peptide is surrounded by water molecules, the fluorescence spectra are characterized by an emission centered near 355 nm. However, if the Trp residue becomes buried in a hydrophobic region when the peptide binds to CaM, the fluorescence emission undergoes a blue shift and typically an increase in the fluorescence intensity (32Burstein E.A.

These differences indicate that the Trp aromatic ring has a unique environment in the SCaM-1 or -4 binding pocket, as was observed in previous work with SCaMs and a peptide derived from another CaM-binding plant protein (27Yamniuk A.P. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7698-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The best fitting of the titration curves (insets in Fig. 2, A, C, and E) has been obtained with a two-site model, providing evidence that the binding is characterized by two different processes with distinct affinity, the first interaction having a very high association constant (Ka1 = 107–1010) and the second being significantly lower (Ka1 ∼ 105) (Table 1). Therefore, the stoichiometry for each interaction in the presence of free Ca2+ is 1 SCaM:2 peptides. Although for the second interaction, there were not significant differences in the affinity between SCaM-1 and -4, for the first interaction, SCaM-1 had higher affinity for all of the three peptides. Interestingly, like the longer peptides, NtMKP1-sD peptide (Fig. 1), which is shorter than the usual CaMBD (12Ishida H. Vogel H.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), bound to the SCaMs with nanomolar affinity. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that, for the first interaction, NtMKP1-B had an affinity to SCaMs higher than NtMKP1-A and -sD. This result implies that its extra residues (Gly450–Lys460) can establish additional interactions to SCaMs.FIGURE 2Steady-state Trp fluorescence emission spectra of SCaMs in presence of NtMKP1 peptides.

This result implies that the additional residues are important for the apo-SCaMs binding as they are in the presence of free Ca2+. Furthermore, the best fitting of the titration curve was obtained with a single binding model, indicating that without Ca2+, the stoichiometry for the complex is 1:1 (inset in Fig. 2D). The affinity of NtMKP1-B for both SCaM-1 and SCaM-4 is ∼105 m–1 (Table 1), whereas NtMKP1-A and -sD bind to SCaMs too weakly under these conditions to measure the Ka values.Fluorescence quenching experiments of the apo- and Ca2+-SCaM-peptide complexes clearly indicate that the Trp residue becomes shielded from the quencher when bound to SCaMs, as shown by the low Ksv values (Fig. 3). Furthermore, near-UV CD spectroscopy, which is very sensitive to the local environment of the aromatic side chains, shows that the Trp mobility is restricted when the peptide is bound to apo- and Ca2+-SCaMs (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the Ksv values of NtMKP1-B in complex with apo-SCaMs are significantly lower than the value of the peptide alone and similar to those of the Ca2+ complexes. This result suggests that the Trp residue is buried when bound to SCaMs even in the absence of free Ca2+.FIGURE 3Stern-Volmer quenching constants.

Fig. 4A shows that the binding curves of NtMKP1-B with the SCaMs are clearly characterized by a two-step process, and therefore a two-site binding model was used for fitting the data. The thermodynamics of NtMKP1-sD binding to the Ca2+-SCaMs are similar to those seen with the two longer peptides (Table 2), whereas the peptides NtMKP1-sC and -sE (Fig. 1) did not have a significant affinity for both SCaMs (data not shown). These results validate the hypothesis suggested by the fluorescence data that NtMKP1-sD is the primary CaM binding region of NtMKP1 protein. Also in agreement with the fluorescence results, the stoichiometry is consistent with the formation of a 1:2 complex, and the two binding processes have very distinct Ka values. Because Ka values larger than 108 are outside the sensitivity range of the ITC technique, it is impossible to quantitatively analyze the affinity (ΔG or TΔS) of the first binding process (34Perozzo R. Folkers G. Scapozza L. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 2004; 24: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, the ΔH of the high affinity interaction can be accurately determined (34Perozzo R. Folkers G. Scapozza L. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 2004; 24: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although the ΔH was highly dependent on the temperature, it was always negative, indicating that the binding of both peptides to SCaMs is an exothermic event in the temperature range tested. Interestingly, ΔH values for the first binding of SCaM-1 are generally more negative"
https://openalex.org/W2050354485,"Leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall is a critical early step in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and is mediated in part by the leukocyte integrin, VLA-4, which binds to endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) -1. Here, we investigate VLA-4's role in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). At various time points (6-48 h) after EIU induction, the severity of the inflammation was evaluated by quantifying cell and protein content in the aqueous fluid, firm leukocyte adhesion in the retinal vessels, and the number of extravasated leukocytes into the vitreous. Functional activation of VLA-4 in vivo was investigated in our previously introduced autoperfused micro flow chamber assay. Firm adhesion of EIU leukocytes to immobilized VCAM-1 under physiological blood flow conditions was significantly increased compared with normal controls (P<0.05), suggesting an important role for VLA-4 in EIU. VLA-4 blockade in vivo significantly suppressed all uveitis-related inflammatory parameters studied, decreasing the clinical score by 45% (P<0.01), protein content in the aqueous fluid by 21% (P<0.01), retinal leukostasis by 68% (P<0.01), and leukocyte accumulation in the vitreous by 75% (P<0.01). Our data provide novel evidence for functional up-regulation of VLA-4 during EIU and suggest VLA-4 blockade as a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of acute inflammatory eye diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2001044345,"We previously analyzed the role of pausing induced by hairpin structures within RNA templates in facilitating strand transfer by HIV-1 RT (reverse transcriptase). We proposed a multistep transfer mechanism in which pause-induced RNase H cuts within the initial RNA template (donor) expose regions of cDNA. A second homologous RNA template (acceptor) can interact with the cDNA at such sites, initiating transfer. The acceptor-cDNA hybrid is thought to then propagate by branch-migration, eventually catching up with the primer terminus and completing the transfer. The prominent pause site in the template system facilitated acceptor invasion; however, very few of the transfers terminated at this pause. To examine the effects of homology on pause-promoted transfer, we increased template homology before the pause site, from 19 nucleotides (nt) in the initial template system to 52 nt in the new system. Significantly, the increased homology enhanced transfers 3-fold, with 32% of the transfers now terminating at the pause site. Additionally, the acceptor cleavage profile indicated the creation of a new invasion site in the added region of homology. NC (nucleocapsid) increased the strand transfer throughout the whole template. However, the prominent hot spot for internal transfer remained, which was still at the pause site. We interpret the new results to mean that pause sites can also serve to stall DNA synthesis, allowing acceptor invasions initiated earlier in the template to catch up with the primer terminus.

A big challenge for HIV-1 treatment is drug resistance, which the virus develops quickly after antiviral drug treatment. HIV-1 is a highly mutagenic retrovirus because of the low fidelity of reverse transcriptase (RT), which lacks 3′-5′ proofreading ability (1Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J. Loeb L.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 2Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Recombination can disperse mutations to generate viruses that better evade the host immune system and are resistant to multiple antivirus drugs (3Gu Z. Gao Q. Faust E.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Gen.

Recombination can also restore defective viruses (5Wooley D.P. Smith R.A. Czajak S. Desrosiers R.C. J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 7368-7375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).HIV-1 packages two copies of RNA as its genome. Reverse transcription generates a linear DNA duplex from the viral RNA genome, which later integrates into the host genome. Strand transfers, in which an elongating primer switches from one template (donor) to another (acceptor), are part of the replication process (8Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). Two template switch events are required to complete reverse transcription. They are referred to as the minus strong stop DNA transfer and the plus strong stop DNA transfer. RT can also transfer within internal regions of the viral genome (9Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1556-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 10Goodrich D.W. Duesberg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetic recombination occurs when such template switching occurs between two heterozygous genomic RNAs copackaged within the virion. Heterozygous virions are produced by double infection, a process which has been shown to occur during HIV-1 infection (16Dang Q. Chen J. Unutmaz D. Coffin J.M. Pathak V.K. Powell D. KewalRamani V.N.

However, most primer terminus transfers occurred within the hairpin. This leads to the proposal of the “Dock and Lock” mechanism for transfer (28Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P.

RT pausing leads to clustering of RNase H cleavages exposing the nascent DNA, allowing the acceptor to invade at the hairpin base (Dock step). RT continues to synthesize the cDNA on the donor template. The acceptor-cDNA interaction propagates and transfer of the primer terminus (Lock step) occurs later in the stem and loop regions of the hairpin. Results suggest that invasion is most effective when the acceptor is weakly structured within the region of invasion, contributing to efficient transfer (28Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K.

We found that the extended homology significantly increased strand transfer while also promoting a peak of primer terminus transfer at the pause site at the hairpin base. Results showed that stalling of synthesis at a pause site allows acceptor invasions initiated earlier in the template to catch up with the primer terminus. The combined data suggest that while pause-promoted RNase H cuts facilitate acceptor invasion, stalling of synthesis at a pause site can also promote primer terminus transfer of invasions occurring earlier.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Expression plasmids (HXB2 strain) pKK-p66(His)6 and pKK-p51(His)6 (48Lee R.

DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA technologies (Coralville, IA). DH5α competent cells, NotI, HindIII, and Taq polymerase were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). BsrI was from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Templiphi Amplification kit was obtained from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). Poly oligo(dA) and oligo(dT) were purchased from the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (New Haven, CT). [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Escherichia coli RNase H (10 units/μl) and the T7 MEGA shortscript were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). All other reagents were obtained from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN).Generation of RNA Templates—The donor construct pEIAV-Donor and acceptor constructs pEIAV-A2 and pEIAV-A1 have been previously described (28Roda R.H.

Donor RNA DI, DN, and acceptor RNA A19 were generated by run-off transcription in vitro from pEIAV-Donor linearized with NotI, pEIAV-Donor linearized with BsrI and pEIAV-A2 linearized with HindIII, respectively, using T7 RNA polymerase as previously described (28Roda R.H.

The long homology acceptor RNA templates A52 and mA52 were generated by run-off transcription in vitro using the Ambion T7 MEGA shortscript kit, from PCR products derived from pEIAV-A2 and pEIAV-A1, respectively. The forward PCR primer (5′-CCTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGG) and reverse primer (5′-TTAGGTGACATTATAGAATATGTATCAC), with underscored nucleotides that vary by plasmid to determine transfer distribution, were used. All RNAs were purified by 8% denaturing PAGE. RNAs were quantitated using the Ribogreen assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and UV absorption measured on a GeneQuant II from Amersham Biosciences.Preparation of Substrates—To 5′ end-label RNA template, the purified RNA was first treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphate. Then RNA templates and DNA primers were 5′ end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Unincorporated ATP was removed using a Bio-Rad P-30 Micro BioSpin size exclusion column. Donor RNA templates and the DNA primers mixed in the appropriate ratios were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. DNA primers SP6 (5′-TACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG) and lg17 (5′-CAGTGCCAAGCTGAC) primed synthesis on donor DI and DN, respectively.Primer Extension and Strand Transfer Assay—Reactions were performed as previously described with slight modifications (28Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46900-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The donor template and radiolabeled DNA primer were annealed in a 1:2 ratio for primer extension experiments. For the strand transfer assay, the donor:acceptor:primer ratio was 1:2:2. RT was preincubated with the substrate mixture at room temperature for 5 min prior to initiation of reactions by addition of MgCl2 and dNTPs. The final reaction contained 4 nm primer, 2 nm donor, 4 nm acceptor, 35 nm RT, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 μm dNTPs, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. For reactions performed in the presence of NC, 200% NC, unless indicated otherwise, was added to the mixture prior to addition of RT and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and were terminated at appropriate time points by addition of 2× termination dye (20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 90% formamide, and 0.1% each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole). Reaction products were separated by 6% denaturing PAGE and visualized by Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and Image-Quant software v 1.2 (GE Healthcare).Analysis of Transfer Products—To determine the location of primer terminus transfer among the transfer products generated, transfer products from the short homology templates DI/A19 were isolated, amplified, cloned, and sequenced as previously described (28Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46900-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transfer products from the long homology templates DN/A52 and DN/mA52 were purified similarly and PCR-amplified using primers lg11 (5′-ACACCGTCAGCCACCAGAGCTCACTAGGGATAAATATAA) and lg12 (5′-ACTGGGATCCTGCAGTGCCAAGCTGAC). The amplified DNA products were double-digested by SacI and BamHI, and cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (51Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Individual colonies were picked, and the plasmid was amplified for DNA sequencing. Each clone represented an individual transfer product. To address the possibility of PCR recombination, primer extension products isolated from separate donor and acceptor extension reactions were mixed in equal amounts and PCR-amplified using primers lg22 (5′-ACCAGAGCTCACTAGGGTCTACTCAGTCCC) and lg23 (5′-ACTGGGATCCTGTTAGGTGACATTATAGAATATG). The amplified products were cloned and sequenced to determine the percentage of recombinants generated during PCR.RNase H Cleavage Assays—For donor cleavage assays, transfer reactions were performed as described above using 5′ end-labeled donor template and unlabeled primer. A 1:2 ratio of donor:acceptor was used. For acceptor cleavage assays, transfer reactions were set up as described above with 5′ end-labeled acceptor template. A 1:3 ratio of donor:acceptor was used. For experiments using E. coli RNase H to detect acceptor:cDNA hybrids, transfer reactions were terminated with a final concentration of 1 nm poly oligo (dA):oligo (dT) and 50 μm ddNTPs at appropriate time points. The terminated reaction mixture was then incubated with 7 units of E. coli RNase H at 37 °C for 3 min, followed by addition of 2× termination dye, as described above, to terminate the reactions. Reaction products were separated by 10% denaturing PAGE.RESULTSIn this study we designed substrates to examine how template homology before a pause site influences strand transfer.Templates with Increased Homology before the Pause Site—Our previous work describing the pause-promoted two-step transfer mechanism was performed using stable hairpin structure containing donor DI and acceptor A19 RNA templates. The templates shared a homology of 97 nt, comprised of a 78-nt hairpin and a 19-nt region before the hairpin (Fig. 1A). The prominent pause site at the hairpin base in the template system facilitated acceptor invasion; however, very few of the transfers terminated at this pause site. To examine the effects of homology on pause-promoted transfer, the homology before the hairpin was increased from 19 to 52 nt, increasing the total homology to 130 nt (Fig. 1A). The last nucleotide at the 5′-end of the homology between the donor and acceptor RNA templates is different. This difference is designed to inhibit end transfer, the transfer after completion of synthesis to the end of donor. MFold (52Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar, 53Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10081) Google Scholar) structure prediction analysis of the acceptor template suggested that the original hairpin structure was undisturbed, and no additional stable structures were formed within the extended homology (Fig. 1B).Increased Homology before the Pause Site Increased Transfer—Primer extension was performed by HIV-1 RT using a 5′ end-labeled DNA primer annealed to the donor template. Donor extension product (DE) was formed when the DNA primer synthesized to the 5′-end of the donor. Because the 3′-end of the donor extension product can form a hairpin, it can use itself as a template to continue synthesis, producing a longer DNA fold-back product (FB) (Fig. 2A). For the short homology substrates (Fig. 2B), DE was 136-nt long and FB was 194-nt long. RT paused early in the reaction at the hairpin base +58, and that pause product was observed throughout the reaction, although decreasing in intensity. At 1 min, 41% of extended products in the donor extension system were paused at +58, while 5% were full-length products (DE and FB). At 30 min, 22% of the extended products remained at pause site +58 while 31% were full-length products. Other pausing was also observed at +80, +93, +120, and numerous minor sites. With the long homology substrate (Fig. 2C), a 164-nt DE and a 250-nt FB were formed. The extended homology did not significantly disturb the stable hairpin structure as indicated by little effect on RT pausing at the hairpin base +86. RT pausing at +86 was prominent until 5 min, but then efficiently chased away with time. At 1 min, 21% of extended products on the donor were paused at +86 while 5% were full-length products (DE and FB). At 30 min, 7% extended products remained at pause site +86, while 20% were full-length products. The other pause products at +108, +121, and +148 were equivalent to those at +80, +93, and +120 in the short homology substrates. Within the extended homology region in DN, a new pause site at position +42 was seen early in the reaction, but efficiently chased away.FIGURE 2HIV-1 RT catalyzed donor extension and transfer reactions.

For the short and long homology substrates, TP lengths were 149-nt long (Fig. 2B) and 177-nt long (Fig. 2C) respectively. In both systems, pausing at the hairpin base decreased more quickly in the transfer reaction than in donor extension reactions. Especially for the long homology substrate, the prominent pause site almost disappeared with the accumulation of TP.Transfer efficiency is indicative of how frequently the primer terminus switches from donor template to acceptor template and was calculated as TE = TP/(TP + DE + FB) × 100%. The TE showed that the extended homology played an important role in strand transfer. Compared with the short homology system DI/A19, the transfer efficiency of the long homology system, DN/A52, was greater, increasing from 6 to 20% at 30 min (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Transfer efficiency and transfer reactions in the presence of NC.

https://openalex.org/W2015002033,"Transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) is a homolog of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), the receptor responsible for the uptake of iron-loaded transferrin (holo-Tf) into cells. Unlike the ubiquitous TfR1, TfR2 is predominantly expressed in the liver. Mutations in TfR2 gene cause a rare autosomal recessive form of the iron overload disease, hereditary hemochromatosis. Previous studies demonstrated that holo-Tf increases TfR2 levels by stabilizing TfR2 at the protein level. In this study we constructed two chimeras, one of which had the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 and the remaining portion of TfR1 and the other with the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain of TfR1 joined to the ectodomain of TfR2. Similar to TfR2, the levels of the chimera containing only the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner after the addition of holo-Tf to the medium. The half-life of the chimera increased 2.7-fold in cells exposed to holo-Tf like the endogenous TfR2 in HepG2 cells. Like TfR2 and unlike TfR1, the levels of the chimera did not respond to intracellular iron content. These results suggest that although holo-Tf binding to the ectodomain is necessary, the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 is largely responsible for its stabilization by holo-Tf."

Interestingly, the gene encoding the enzyme is adjacent to that encoding hemolytic phospholipase C (plcH) in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a well known pathogen for opportunistic infections. We report here that simultaneous production of PlcH and ceramidase was induced by several lipids and PlcH-induced hemolysis was significantly enhanced by the action of the ceramidase. When the strain was cultured with sphingomyelin or phosphatidylcholine, production of both enzymes drastically increased, causing the increase of hemolytic activity in the cell-free culture supernatant. Ceramide and sphingosine were also effective in promoting the production of ceramidase but not that of PlcH. Furthermore, we found that the hemolytic activity of a Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase was significantly enhanced by addition of a recombinant Pseudomonas ceramidase. TLC analysis of the erythrocytes showed that ceramide produced from sphingomyelin by the sphingomyelinase was partly converted to sphingosine by the ceramidase. A ceramidase-null mutant strain caused much less hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes than did the wild-type strain. Sphingosine was detected in the erythrocytes co-cultured with the wild-type strain but not the mutant strain. Finally, we found that the enhancement of PlcH-induced hemolysis by the ceramidase occurred in not only sheep but also human erythrocytes. These results may indicate that the ceramidase enhances the PlcH-induced cytotoxicity and provide new insights into the role of sphingolipid-degrading enzymes in the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa.

Because Sph is produced not through de novo synthesis but from Cer by the action of CDase (2Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

Based on optimal pH and primary structure, CDases are classified into three groups: acid, neutral, and alkaline enzymes (3Ito M. Okino N. Tani M. Mitsutake S. Kita K. Futerman A.H.

The functions of neutral CDases have been investigated not only at the cellular level but also at the individual level. Recently, Acharya et al. (14Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Acharya U. Mowen B.M. Nagashima K. Acharya J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We also reported that neutral CDase is essential for the metabolism of Cer in zebrafish embryogenesis (8Yoshimura Y. Tani M. Okino N. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44012-44022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the physiological functions of bacterial CDases are still unknown. P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative pathogen capable of causing great morbidity and mortality in burn victims, those with cystic fibrosis, and immunocompromised patients (16Bodey G.P. Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 279-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The bacteria have been also found in dermatitic lesions of sheep suffering from fleece rot, which is characterized by superficial inflammation of the skin. Like many other pathogens, P. aeruginosa secretes a number of extracellular virulence factors including exotoxins, proteases, hemolysins, and phospholipases (17Vasil M.L. J. Pediatr. 1986; 108: 800-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Two hemolysins produced by the pathogen are a heat-stable glycolipid (18Fujita K. Akino T. Yoshioka H. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1385-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a heat-labile phospholipase C (PLC) known as the hemolytic PLC (PlcH) (19Vasil M.L. Berka R.M. Gray G.L. Nakai H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, P. aeruginosa elaborates two homologous extracellular PLCs, a PlcH and a non-hemolytic PLC (PlcN) (20Ostroff R.M. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although PlcH and PlcN show ∼40% identity at the amino acid level, substrate specificity of these two PLCs are quite different, PlcH hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC), lyso-PC, and sphingomyelin (SM), whereas PlcN hydrolyzes PC and phosphatidylserine but not lyso-PC or SM (20Ostroff R.M. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Stonehouse M.J. Cota-Gomez A. Parker S.K. Martin W.E. Hankin J.A. Murphy R.C. Chen W. Lim K.B. Hackett M. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 661-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Very recently, a novel extracellular PLC (PlcB) was cloned using a bioinformatics approach (22Barker A.P. Vasil A.I. Filloux A. Ball G. Wilderman P.J. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Disruption of the plcB gene revealed that PlcB is essential for directed twitching motility up a phospholipid gradient of certain species of either phosphatidylethanolamine or PC (22Barker A.P.

In this paper, we report the role of a bacterial CDase in P. aeruginosa for the first time. Our study clearly indicates that the CDase enhances PlcH-induced hemolysis of sheep as well as human erythrocytes. This observation would explain, in part, how PlcH of P. aeruginosa is toxic to host cells. Materials—N-Palmitoylsphingosine, SM, d-erythro-Sph, sodium taurodeoxycholate, C6-NBD-SM, fatty acid-free albumin from human serum (HSA), and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma.

Yasuda, National Institute of Genetics, Japan. CDase and PlcH from P. aeruginosa were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a polyhistidine-tagged protein at the C terminus. The expressed proteins were purified by Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Bacterial Strains and Media—A type strain of P. aeruginosa IFO12689 was obtained from the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka (IFO), Japan. P. aeruginosa strains were cultivated in PY-medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.1% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.2) at 30 °C. E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. The media were supplemented with antibiotics such as ampicillin (100 μg/ml for E. coli), carbenicillin (100 μg/ml for E. coli), kanamycin (50 μg/ml for E. coli), and tetracycline (15 μg/ml for E. coli and 200 μg/ml for P. aeruginosa) when necessary. Preparation of the Culture Supernatant—Inocula from an agar plate of P. aeruginosa strain AN17 were introduced into a 14-ml test tube containing 2 ml of sterilized PY-medium, and incubated at 30 °C for 1 day with vigorous shaking. Cells of the AN17 strain were harvested by centrifugation (11,000 × g for 1 min), washed once with 1 ml of saline, and resuspended in saline (A600 nm = 2.0). A 10-μl aliquot of the cell suspension was inoculated into 2 ml of PY-medium containing 0.05% sodium taurodeoxycholate and 100 μm of each lipid, and shaken at 30 °C for 24 h. The culture fluid was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant obtained was used for the enzyme assay. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein transfer onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane was performed using TransBlot SD (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After treatment with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) for 1 h, the membrane was incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-Pseudomonas CDase antibody. After a wash with T-TBS, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h. After another wash with T-TBS, the ECL reaction was performed for 10 min as recommended by the manufacturer, and chemiluminescence was detected with an ECL Mini-camera (Amersham Biosciences). Assay of CDase—The activity of CDase was measured using C12-NBD-Cer as a substrate as described below. The reaction mixture contained 1 nmol of C12-NBD-Cer and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Following incubation at 37 °C for an appropriate time, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), mixed, and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min. Five microliters of lower phase was applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia (14/6/1, v/v) as a developing solvent. The C12-NBD-fatty acid released by the action of the enzyme and the remaining C12-NBD-Cer were then analyzed and quantified with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) (excitation, 475 nm; emission, 525 nm). One enzyme unit of CDase was defined as the amount capable of catalyzing the release of 1 μmol of C12-NBD-fatty acid/min from the C12-NBD-Cer under the conditions described above. A value of 10–3 unit enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit in this study. Assay of SMase—The activity of SMase was measured using C6-NBD-SM as a substrate as described below. The reaction mixture contained 1 nmol of C6-NBD-SM and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Assays were generally carried out at 37 °C for an appropriate time. The reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and the reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min. The C6-NBD-Cer released by the action of the enzyme and the remaining C6-NBD-SM were analyzed and quantified as described above. One enzyme unit of SMase was defined as the amount capable of catalyzing the release of 1 μmol of C6-NBD-Cer/min from the C6-NBD-SM under the conditions described above. A value of 10–3 units of enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit in this study. Assay of Hemolysis—The hemolytic activity was examined by adding the sample to a 10% sheep erythrocyte suspension in TBS, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. After the reaction, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was then diluted with distilled water (3 volumes) and the release of hemoglobin was measured using a spectrophotometer at 490 nm. Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—For RT-PCR experiments, cells were grown in PY-medium as described above for 9 h (late exponential phase). Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cells using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.), treated with an RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen), and re-purified using the same kit. DNase-treated RNA was used as a template for RT-PCR with the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Primers used for the cdase were GGCTGGAGGAAGGCAACAATC (sense) and GCGTAGCCATTGAAGACCACA (antisense); and for the plcH, TCTACCGGCCCAGTCCCAAAT (sense) and GGTCCGGCCCAGTTCCTCTCC (antisense). A 10-μl volume of each reaction mixture was analyzed by agarose (2% w/v) gel electrophoresis to detect the RT-PCR products (for cdase, 298 bp; for plcH, 299 bp). For quantification of the signals, agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed with a CS Analyzer (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Lipid Extraction and TLC Analysis—For extraction of lipids, the harvested erythrocytes were suspended in 1-propanol/hexane/water (55:35:10, v/v), subjected to sonication for 5 min, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants obtained were dried by SpeedVac concentrator, dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and then applied to TLC plates, which were developed with chloroform, methanol, 0.02% CaCl2 (5:4:1, v/v) for SM, chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v) for Sph, and chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia (90:10:1, v/v) for Cer. TLC plates were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for SM and Cer, and ninhydrin reagent for Sph. Measurement of SM Content—The amount of SM was measured according to the method of He et al. (27He X. Chen F. McGovern M.M. Schuchman E.H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 306: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, erythrocytes were mixed with a 20-fold volume of 0.2% Triton X-100, lysed by vortexing and sonication, and centrifuged briefly in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant obtained was used for the determination of SM content. Five microliters of sample was added to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate that contained an enzyme mixture consisting of 12.5 milliunits of B. cereus SMase, 400 milliunits of alkaline phosphatase, 120 milliunits of choline oxidase, 200 milliunits of horseradish peroxidase, and 20 nmol of Amplex Red reagent (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). For each test sample, a negative control well contained 5 μl of the sample and the same reaction mixture, excluding SMase. After 20 min at 37 °C, the microtiter plate was read using an ARVO fluorescence microplate reader (PerkinElmer). The excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 544 and 590 nm, respectively. Amounts of SM were calculated using C18-SM as the standard. Measurement of Sph Content—The amount of Sph was measured with HPLC essentially as described in Merrill et al. (28Merrill A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, erythrocytes were mixed with a 20-fold volume of 0.2% Triton X-100, lysed by vortexing and sonication, and centrifuged briefly in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant obtained was used for the determination of Sph content. An aliquot of 20 μl of sample was mixed with 20 pmol of C17-Sph (internal standard) and 0.2 ml of 0.1 m KOH in chloroform/methanol (1:4, v/v), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Sph was extracted by adding 0.4 ml each of chloroform and water, and the chloroform phase was washed with water and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. The extract was dissolved in 120 μl of ethanol and incubated at 67 °C for 25 min, and mixed with 15 μl of o-phthalaldehyde reaction buffer (9.9 ml of 3% boric acid, pH 10.5, mixed with 0.1 ml of ethanol containing 10 mg of o-phthalaldehyde and 20 μl of β-mercaptoethanol). After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, the sample was then applied to an Inertosil ODS-3 column (4.6 × 100 mm; GL Science Inc.), which was equilibrated with methanol and 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, (9/1, v/v). Sph bases were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min using a HITACHI L-7110 HPLC system and detected with a HITACHI L-1050 fluorescence detector (excitation at 340 nm and emission at 455 nm). Construction of CDase-null Mutant—A CDase-deficient strain was constructed by insertion of the tetracycline resistance (Tcr) cassette into the cdase gene via homologous recombination (25Schäfer A. Tauch A. Jäger W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Pühler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). Because the cdase gene has a unique SacII site at its center, the Tcr cassette of pBR322 was amplified by PCR using a sense primer with a SacII restriction site (5′-CTTCCGCGGTTCTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCAT-3′) and antisense primer with a SacII restriction site (5′-GCCCCGCGGTTCCATTCAGGTCGAGGTGG-3′). The resulting 1.2-kb PCR product was digested with SacII and cloned into the SacII site of the full-length cdase gene containing vector pTCDS7, generating pTCDS7T. The cdase::Tcr construct in pTCDS7T was amplified by PCR using a sense primer with an EcoRI restriction site (5′-GGAATTCATGTCACGTTCCGCATTCACC-3′) and antisense primer with an EcoRI restriction site (5′-AGAATTCCTAGGGAGTGGTGCCGAGCAC-3′). The resulting 3.2-kb PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into pK19mobsacB cut with the same enzyme, generating pk19CDT. The plasmid, which contained a mutant cdase disrupted with the Tcr gene, was transferred from the broad host-range mobilizing strain E. coli S17-1 (29Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar) to P. aeruginosa by biparental filter matings. Tcr plasmid integrants were selected on NAC medium containing Tc. Tcr colonies were then plated on LB agar containing 5% sucrose to identify strains that had lost the vector-associated sacB gene (resistant to sucrose). Gene replacement was ascertained by PCR of the cdase gene. Induction of CDase, SMase, and Hemolytic Activities by Lipids—Analysis of the genomic sequence of P. aeruginosa PA01 (30Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S. Hufnagle W.O. Kowalik D.J. Lagrou M. Garber R.L. Goltry L. Tolentino E. Westbrock-Wadman S. Yuan Y. Brody L.L. Coulter S.N. Folger K.R. Kas A. Larbig K. Lim R. Smith K. Spencer D. Wong G.K. Wu Z. Paulsen I.T. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Hancock R.E. Lory S. Olson M.V. Nature. 2000; 406: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar) has revealed that the cdase gene (mapped as PA0845) and the hemolytic PLC (plcH) gene (mapped as PA0844) neighbor each other (Fig. 1). To understand how these genes are regulated, we first examined the effect of SM on the growth of strain AN17 and the induction of CDase and PlcH activities. During the exponential phase, SM had no effect on the growth of the strain, however, it significantly enhanced cell growth from the late exponential phase to stationary phase (Fig. 2A). We next analyzed the CDase and PlcH activities in the growth phase. We used C6-NBD-SM for measuring PlcH activity because PlcH hydrolyzes PC as well as SM. Both CDase and PlcH activities were significantly induced in the presence of SM (Fig. 2, B and C). The metabolism of the SM added was also analyzed by TLC. As shown in Fig. 2D, in the culture medium, we first detected only SM, which was degraded to Cer and then Sph in a time-dependent manner. After 24 h, no lipids were detected in the culture medium suggesting that these substrates were completely metabolized. Next, the induction of these two enzymes was analyzed at the mRNA level by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the cells at a late exponential phase of cell growth (9 h) and RT-PCR was performed using specific oligonucleotide primers to determine the mRNA levels of cdase and plcH. Interestingly, gene expression of cdase was significantly induced by SM, however, that of plcH was not under the conditions used in this study (Fig. 2, E and F). Next, we examined the effect of sphingolipids and their metabolites, and other phospholipids on the production of these two enzymes. When the strain was cultured in the PY-medium containing SM, production of CDase increased significantly (∼50-fold) (Fig. 3A). Cer, C2-Cer, Sph, and PC also promoted production of the enzyme (10–20-fold activation), but not as effectively as SM, whereas palmitic acid, phosphatidic acid, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine were ineffective. We next analyzed PlcH activity in the culture medium. When the strain was cultured in the PY-medium containing SM or PC, the secretion of PlcH into the medium increased significantly (∼2-fold) (Fig. 3B). However, Cer, C2-Cer, Sph, palmitic acid, and diacylglycerol had almost no effect on the enzymatic activity. Even in the PY-medium without lipids, the strain produced a certain amount of PlcH. This observation is well consistent with the report that PlcH activity was produced under low-phosphate conditions without inducers (31Pritchard A.E. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 291-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine inhibited the production of the enzyme, although these lipids did not inhibit the growth of the strain. PlcH has been shown to be a major hemolytic factor of P. aeruginosa (19Vasil M.L. Berka R.M. Gray G.L. Nakai H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 431-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus we examined the hemolytic activity of the culture supernatant using sheep erythrocytes. As shown in Fig. 3C, the hemolytic activity of this strain is well consistent with the PlcH activity when measured with C6-NBD-SM. Interestingly, hemolytic activity seems to be enhanced in proportion to the production of CDase by this strain, suggesting that CDase contributes to the PlcH-induced hemolysis.FIGURE 2Expression of CDase and SMase (PlcH) throughout the growth phase.

KatG mutants W107F, Y229F, and the double mutant W107F/Y229F showed alteration in type and yield of radical species. Results are consistent with formation of a tyrosyl radical reasonably assigned to residue Tyr229 within the first few milliseconds of turnover. This is followed by a mixture of tyrosyl and tryptophanyl radical species and finally to only a tyrosyl radical on residue Tyr353, which lies more distant from the heme.

KatG has been classified as a Class I peroxidase, but exhibits high catalase activity. Understanding the correspondence between specific structural features and catalytic function in KatG enzymes is in its early stages. In the course of work on KatG in this laboratory and others, it has become clear that amino acid-based radicals, formed during turnover of the enzyme with peroxide, must be accounted for in order to understand mechanistic issues that distinguish the catalase-peroxidases from the corresponding monofunctional enzymes. Furthermore, a specific requirement for a radical in the catalase reaction path of KatG has been proposed and incorporated into a novel mechanism that diverges from the two-electron reactions defined for classical catalases (4Jakopitsch C.

Jakopitsch C. Droghetti E. Obinger C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 568-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Additionally, a post-translational modification of amino acid side chains in the distal pocket of KatG enzymes is thought to result from radical formation catalyzed by the heme (6Jakopitsch C. Kolarich D. Petutschnig G. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Ghiladi R.A. Knudsen G.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22651-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A mechanistic role for KatG radicals may also be relevant to mammalian catalases in which a protein-based radical is considered protective of dead-end catalytic paths such as compound II formation (8Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Ghiladi R.A. Medzihradszky K.F. Rusnak F.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 13428-13442Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We suggested in a previous report that radicals could have a catalytic function, because they were quenched in reactions with INH (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To continue making progress toward understanding these issues, a survey of radical formation in Mtb KatG continues to be a worthwhile goal. Recent reports have addressed the identification and characterization of radicals appearing within milliseconds and through 10 s of turnover of resting M. tuberculosis KatG with alkyl peroxides (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Zhao X. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7606-7612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and within 5–10 s of reaction for the homologous enzyme from Synechocystis sp. (12Ivancich A. Dorlet P. Goodin D.B. Un S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5050-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Ivancich A. Jakopitsch C.M.A. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Critical questions then arise: are any of these radicals important for enzyme function in all KatG enzymes, and which amino acids are involved? One approach to the analysis of radical production in peroxidases has historically involved examination of mutants, which may or may not yield confirmation of the location of radicals in the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Trapping and other techniques have also been applied to gain insights into radical formation and identity in a collection of metalloenzymes. Both these approaches have allowed identification of tyrosyl and tryptophanyl radicals in KatG enzymes and some assignment of the residues on which they reside (12Ivancich A. Dorlet P. Goodin D.B. Un S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5050-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 13Ivancich A. Jakopitsch C.M.A. Un S. Obinger C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14093-14102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A combined approach, in which more than a single experimental method is applied, is expected to provide a more accurate picture of radical formation. Evidence now points to a unique catalytic requirement in catalase-peroxidases of three amino acids on the distal side of the heme, which appear in a covalent adduct connecting the side chains of Trp107, Tyr229, and Met255 in all KatG crystal structures (Fig. 1) (6Jakopitsch C.

Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The detailed reasons for this are in some cases related to a change in the stability of intermediates in either mechanism in mutants; for example, in Mtb KatG[Y229F], a very rapid conversion of compound I, the classical oxoferryl heme π -cation radical species, to a stable compound II occurs, allowing peroxidase activity but eliminating catalase activity (8Yu S. Girotto S. Zhao X. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44121-44127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); and in Mtb KatG[W107F], facile conversion to and stable formation of compound III also interferes with catalase activity. 4S. Yu and R. Magliozzo, unpublished data.4S. Yu and R. Magliozzo, unpublished data. Amino acid-based radicals play roles in those mechanistic changes. The formation of the covalent bonds within the distal side adduct is also proposed to involve Tyr and Trp radicals (14Ghiladi R.A. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15093-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). No direct insights into the post-translational modification reactions have emerged to date. Interestingly, a related Tyr52-Trp51 modification is found in the structure of the H52Y mutant of CCP. (Trp51, conserved in all Class I peroxidases, is conserved at position 107 in Mtb KatG.) The reaction leading to that modification has also been shown to require turnover of the enzyme and presumably, radical recombination at these sites (17Bhaskar B. Immoos C.E. Shimizu H. Sulc F. Farmer P.J. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In earlier reports (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), tyrosyl radical(s) formation in Mtb KatG was probed using RFQ-EPR spectroscopy. Here, evidence is provided for at least two different residues stabilizing tyrosyl radicals in this enzyme, presenting the challenge of identifying and confirming both sites. HF EPR spectroscopy identified a tryptophanyl radical and confirmed tyrosyl radical as the majority species both at early time points and after several seconds of reaction with peroxide. Examination of new mutant enzymes KatG[W107F], KatG[W91F], and KatG[Y229F/W107F] using X-band RFQ-EPR spectroscopy also assisted in assignments. The effect of INH, in a new approach, demonstrated changes at the earliest time points during initial turnover of resting WT KatG with peroxide. Analysis using a theoretical approach to redox coupling (18Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1992; 258: 1740-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 19Heller C.

The results overall are consistent with radicals formed initially on residues Tyr229 and Trp107 closest to the heme, followed by the appearance of additional radical(s) at more distant sites. Chemicals and Reagents—All standard chemicals and reagents were purchased either from Fisher Scientific or from Sigma-Aldrich. PAA (32%) was diluted to 10 mm in potassium phosphate buffer and was incubated with 780 units/ml bovine liver catalase for 4 h at 37 °C to remove hydrogen peroxide, followed by removal of the enzyme by ultrafiltration. Construction, Expression, and Purification of the W107F, W91F, and [W107F][Y229F] mutants of KatG—The plasmid pKAT II was used as an overexpression vector for KatG (21Johnsson K. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2834-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and for mutagenesis. Escherichia coli strain UM262 (recA katG::Tn10 pro leu rpsL hsdM hsdR endl lacY) (22Loewen P.C. Stauffer G.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used for overexpression of both wild-type and mutated KatG proteins. UM262 and pKAT II were both gifts from Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (synthesized and purified by Qiagene) were designed to introduce the required mutation. The oligonucleotide pairs (mutated codons are in bold) were: W107F, 303GTTTATCCGGATGGCGTTCCACGCTGCCGGCACC336-3′ and 5′-336GGTGCCGGCAGCGTGGAACGCCATCCGGATAAAC303-3′; W91F, 256CCTCGCAGCCGTGGTTTCCCGCCGACTACG286-3′ and 5′-286CGTAGTCGGCGGGAAACCACGGCTGCGAGG256-3′; Y229F, 672GATGGGGCTGATCTTCGTGAACCCGGAGG700-3′ and 5′-700CCTCCGGGTTCACGAAGATCAGCCCCATC672-3′. Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the reaction products were transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain. Sequencing (Gene Wiz, Inc.) of the mutated katG gene confirmed that only the desired nucleotide substitutions occurred, and the mutated plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain UM262 for protein overexpression. Recombinant WT KatG and mutated enzymes were purified as previously described (23Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The pure enzymes had optical purity ratios (A407/A280) greater than or equal to 0.5. RFQ-EPR Sample Preparation—The RFQ-EPR samples were prepared using an Update Instrument, Inc. Model 1000 chemical-freeze-quench apparatus as described previously (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Solutions of enzyme (typically 100 μm heme) and peroxyacetic acid (300 μm) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and the mixture was incubated for the indicated time periods followed by freeze-quenching in isopentane at –130 °C. PAA solutions were freshly prepared before each experiment from stock solution (H2O2-free) stored at –80 °C. For RFQ-EPR experiments in the presence of INH, KatG (100 μm) was reacted with a mixture of peroxyacetic acid (300 μm), and isoniazid (10 mm) was introduced from the second syringe in a typical RFQ-EPR protocol. This concentration of INH was appropriate to ensure rapid reaction with enzyme-based radicals forming and decaying on the millisecond timescale (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The frozen samples were then examined by EPR spectroscopy. An RFQ-EPR experiment was performed using KatG pretreated with 10-fold excess PAA for 1 h at 4 °C. The enzyme was then exchanged into pure phosphate buffer and was re-reacted with PAA in a typical RFQ-EPR protocol. Frozen sample powders collected from the rapid freeze-quench apparatus were packed into precision-bore quartz EPR tubes immersed in the isopentane bath, and after removal of excess isopentane were transferred to liquid nitrogen and finally examined using a Bruker E500 EPR spectrometer operating at X-band. A finger Dewar inserted into the EPR cavity was used for recording spectra at liquid nitrogen (77 K) temperature. The other experimental conditions were: modulation amplitude, 4 G; microwave power, 1 milliwatt; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave frequency, 9.491 GHz. EPR data acquisition and manipulation were performed using XeprView software (Bruker). CuSO4 in 50% ethylene glycol was used as a standard for spin quantification by double integration of EPR signal intensities. The signal-to-noise ratio in EPR spectra was improved by signal averaging when necessary. The estimation of spin concentration in freeze-quenched samples included application of a packing factor of 0.5 to account for sample dilution by isopentane. The 130-GHz EPR experiments were performed on a spectrometer assembled at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which uses a bridge designed and built at the Donetsk Physico-Technical Institute of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences. The magnetic field is generated usinga7T Magnex superconducting magnet equipped with a 0.5 T sweep/active shielding coil. Field swept spectra were obtained in the two pulse echo-detected mode with the following parameters: temperature, 7 K; repetition rate, 30 Hz; 400 averages per point; 90 degree pulse, 40 ns; time τ between pulses, 170 ns. The magnetic field was calibrated to an accuracy of ∼3 G using a sample of manganese doped into MgO (24Burghaus O. Rohrer M. Plato M. Mobius K. Meas. Sci. Tech. 1992; 3: 765-774Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The temperature of the sample was maintained to an accuracy of approximately ± 0.3 K using an Oxford Spectrostat continuous flow cryostat and ITC503 temperature controller. The spectra presented in Fig. 4 are derivatives of the echo-detected spectra. The RFQ sample (∼800 ms) used to obtain the D-band spectrum was prepared as follows. The 0.55-mm OD quartz capillary tube was fitted inside the end of the 700-ms reactor tube of the RFQ instrument. The capillary was immersed in liquid nitrogen, and the reaction mixture was then injected into the immersed tube. Calculations estimate the freeze time of the solution once it enters the tube to be under 100 ms. With the delay time set at 700 ms by choice of the aging loop, the total incubation time for this sample is estimated close to 800 ms. Simulation of EPR data used Simfonia software (Bruker). Determination of the ring rotation angles, θ, in tyrosyl and tryptophanyl radicals was found from the dihedral angle formed between the phenoxyl (indolyl) ring plane and the R-Cβ-C1 plane by examination of the three-dimensional structure of Mtb KatG (PDB code 2CCA). Software and algorithms by Svistunenko were used for calculation of hyperfine coupling values based on the structure of particular residues (25Svistunenko D.A. Cooper C.E. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 582-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Zhao X. Yu H. Yu S. Wang F. Sacchettini J.C. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Electron transfer couplings were calculated used PATHWAYs analysis in HARLEM programs (as applied in Refs. 18Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Science. 1992; 258: 1740-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar and 20Liang Z.X. Kurnikov I.V. Nocek J.M. Mauk A.G. Beratan D.N. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2785-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and were based on the WT KatG crystal structure. RFQ-EPR Spectroscopy of Ferric KatG Plus Peroxide and INH— The RFQ-EPR approach used here has been described previously; briefly, resting (ferric) enzyme is mixed with a 3-fold molar excess of alkyl peroxide (hydrogen peroxide-free), and sample mixtures are frozen in liquid isopentane at –130 °C in precision bore EPR tubes. This small excess of peroxide is sufficient to generate Cmpd I in the enzyme and maximize the yield of radicals (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Spectra are then recorded at 77 K. The time regime available here ranges from 6.4 ms to any longer period of incubation after rapid mixing. Previously reported RFQ-EPR results of experiments in which INH was added to preformed radical species in WT KatG (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated quenching of EPR signals. Here, reaction of the resting enzyme with peroxyacetic acid in the presence of INH elicited a new EPR signal (Fig. 2) different from that found previously. A doublet was detected (∼17 G linewidth) at the earliest time points (for example, 6.4 ms) and after a 50-ms reaction time was only barely detectable. Without INH, a broad doublet (∼29 G) was consistently observed (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The new narrow doublet (ND) signal is reasonably assigned to a radical on the same residue as that giving the broad doublet in WT KatG that has undergone a structural rearrangement because of the binding of INH. (See description below of how these signals depend on the orientation of the phenoxyl ring plane in tyrosyl radicals.) It is important to note that the narrow doublet signal is not from a hydrazyl or other radicals derived from INH (27Sipe Jr., H.J. Jaszewski A.R. Mason R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which is a peroxidase substrate of KatG (28Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) known to react with compound I and with protein-based radicals (10Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A hydrazyl radical would exhibit a more complicated spectrum analogous to that of amine radical powder pattern spectra at low temperature, because of the nitrogen and hydrogen nuclear hyperfine couplings (29Janovsky I. Knolle W. Naumov S. Williams F. Chem. Eur. J. 2004; 10: 5524-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); other radicals missing the hydrazyl group formed upon breakdown of an INH-hydrazyl radical (27Sipe Jr., H.J. Jaszewski A.R. Mason R.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) would also exhibit more complex spectra because of hyperfine couplings to the ring hydrogens as well as the pyridine nitrogen nucleus. A peroxyl radical also identified during the breakdown of INH radicals may also be ruled out because they exhibit axial g-tensors with EPR features around g = 2.035 and 2.006. Simulation of the new ND signal was performed, according to the parameters for a tyrosyl radical given in Table 1. A satisfactory simulation was obtained with Aβ1iso~9G and Aβ2iso~2G (Fig. 2, inset). No satisfactory simulation was produced assuming the ND signal is due to a neutral tryptophanyl radical using reasonable values for Aβ1,2iso, A5′,7′, and A14N (30Lendzian F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1707: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 5The principal hyperfine coupling in tyrosyl and tryptophanyl radicals arises from the interaction of unpaired electron spin in the π – orbital system of the phenoxyl (indolyl) ring with the methylene hydrogens, Hβ1 and Hβ2 of Cβ. This leads to essentially isotropic hyperfine couplings for the β-methylene hydrogens. The magnitude of the coupling constants is related to the spin density at C1 (or C3 for Trp radicals) and to the angle between the π – orbital axis of the ring and the methylene hydrogens according to the McConnell equation (19Heller C. McConnell H.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1960; 32: 1535-1539Crossref Scopus (638) Google Scholar): Aisoβ = ρCn(B′+ B″cos2θ), where Aisoβ is the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant, ρCn is the spin density on C1 or C3, B′, and B″ are constants equal to 0 and 58 G (or 0 and 50 G), respectively, for tyrosyl and tryptophanyl radicals (30Lendzian F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1707: 67-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 50Fessenden R.W. Schuler R.H. J. Chem.

The hyperfine splittings in EPR spectra of tyrosyl (and tryptophanyl) radicals are determined by the known dependence of β-methylene hyperfine couplings on the phenoxyl ring plane orientation, and on the relatively constant hyperfine coupling interactions for the ring protons and has been extensively described elsewhere (25Svistunenko D.A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The orientation dependence allows prediction of the angle formed between the ring plane and the Cβ-Hβ1 and Hβ2 hydrogens; alternatively, when the structure of a particular tyrosine residue is known, prediction of the hyperfine coupling constants can be made. Svistunenko and Cooper (25Svistunenko D.A. Cooper C.E. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 582-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Svistunenko D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have presented a user friendly approach relied upon here for the analysis of EPR spectra. For the wide doublet (WD) signal (Fig. 2, inset), the hyperfine coupling values are consistent with an angle, θ, close to 30 degrees. For the ND signal found in the presence of INH, the reduced splitting indicates an angle around 52 degrees. The most interesting aspect of the effect of INH is that its binding, reported to be within the heme pocket, provides clues for the identity of the residue forming the initial tyrosyl radical doublets (35Bertrand T.

https://openalex.org/W2056924054,"Recent progress has been made on the role of oncoproteins c-Ski and related SnoN in the control of cellular transformation. c-Ski/SnoN potently repress transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) antiproliferative signaling through physical interaction with signal transducers called Smads. Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown. During our investigation on the role of sumoylation in TGF-β signaling, we inadvertently found that SnoN is modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1). Here, we biochemically characterize SnoN sumoylation in detail and report the physiological function of the modification. Sumoylation occurs primarily at lysine 50 (Lys-50). PIAS1 and PIASx proteins physically interact with SnoN to stimulate its sumoylation, thus serving as SUMO-protein isopeptide ligases (E3) for SnoN sumoylation. SnoN sumoylation does not alter its metabolic stability or its ability to repress TGF-β signaling. Notably, loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation. Our study suggests a novel role for SUMO modification in the regulation of myogenic differentiation.

Ski and SnoN are structurally and functionally related nuclear proto-oncoproteins implicated in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Ski/SnoN also initiate terminal skeletal muscle differentiation in quail embryo cells (2Colmenares C. Stavnezer E.

The paradoxical property of Ski/SnoN on transformation and differentiation is not understood, although Ski family proteins may regulate the choice between proliferation and terminal differentiation. In humans and mice, loss of Ski leads to reduced skeletal muscle mass (4Berk M. Desai S.Y. Heyman H.C. Colmenares C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Colmenares C. Heilstedt H.A. Shaffer L.G. Schwartz S. Berk M. Murray J.C. Stavnezer E. Nat.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1462-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ski transactivates expression of muscle-specific genes (7Engert J.C. Servaes S. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Rosenthal N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2988-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modification is a common mechanism for regulating protein function. For example, Ski/SnoN are targets of ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (8Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wan Y. Liu X.

Ubiquitin-like molecules such as SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier) can also modify eukaryotic proteins and alter protein function via changes in protein stability, transcriptional activity, or subcellular localization (reviewed in Ref. 11Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Covalent attachment of SUMO to substrates requires Aos1/Uba2 (E1 enzyme) and Ubc9 (E2 enzyme). In addition, three types of SUMO E3 ligase, namely PIAS proteins, RanBP2, and Pc2, are likely to contribute to substrate specificity and efficiency (11Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that SnoN is SUMO-1 modified, define the sumoylation sites, and identify the E3 ligases required for SnoN sumoylation. We show that sumoylation does not regulate the ability of SnoN to repress TGF-β signaling and that mutation of the major sumoylation site of SnoN enhances its ability to promote myogenesis. Plasmids—cDNAs for SnoN, SnoN(K1–5R), SnoN(K6–8R), and SnoNΔ89–92 (9Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K.

Point mutants and SnoNΔ50 (deletion of the first 50 amino acids) were obtained by PCR. SnoN from pXF2RH was subcloned into pXF2F or pXF3H to generate FLAG and HA-tagged SnoNs, respectively.

Recombinant SnoNs were generated by purification of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins and cleaved from GST by Pre-Scission protease (Amersham Biosciences). SUMO conjugates were analyzed by anti-SnoN or anti-SUMO Western blotting. GST Binding Assay—35S-labeled PIAS, Smad3, and GFP proteins were generated using the TnT® kit (Promega). Translation products were precleared by GST on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-SnoN. After washing, GST-SnoN binding products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Transcription Reporter Assays—Plasmid SBE-luc (containing the luciferase gene under the control of Smad-binding elements (SBEs)), p21-luc, and cyclin A-luc were used to assay TGF-β-induced transcription in HaCaT cells. Transfections, TGF-β treatment, and reporter assays were carried out as described (12Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Plasmid 4R-TK-luc, containing 4xE-boxes activated by myogenic transcription factors, was used to assay the myogenic potential of SnoN in C2C12 cells. C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with 4R-TK-luc, SnoN, and/or MyoD using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and after 24 h, shifted to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/2% horse serum (differentiation medium) for 48 h. Assays were performed in triplicate, and values were normalized against β-galactosidase activity. SnoN Stability Assays—F-SnoN-transfected HEK293T cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 400 μCi ml-1 [35S]methionine/cysteine and then chased in regular medium for the indicated periods of time (see Fig. 5C). Cells were harvested, and SnoN was purified by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Bands were quantified using NIH image (version 1.62), and values were graphed using Microsoft Excel. In an additional SnoN stability test, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-SnoN or FLAG-SnoN(K50R) and FLAG-SUMO-1 and co-transfected with HA-Smad3 where indicated. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 20 μm MG132 for 4 h where appropriate. Cell lysates were analyzed for FLAG-SnoN and HA-Smad3 levels by anti-FLAG and anti-HA Western blotting respectively. C2C12 Cell Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence—C2C12 cells were transfected with vector or FLAG-SnoN (∼60% transfection efficiency). After 24 h, cells at 100% confluency were shifted to differentiation medium and cultured for up to 5 days. Myogenic marker levels were assessed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-myogenin F5D (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-myosin heavy chain (anti-MHC) MF20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and anti-actin (Sigma). NIH Image (version 1.62) was used for quantification. For MHC immunofluorescence, C2C12 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on day 5 of differentiation and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. MHC was detected using anti-MHC followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) and Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscopy. Myotubes were counted in 20 random vision fields, and the mean number of myotubes was calculated. Multinucleated myotubes were counted in 20 random vision fields, and the mean was calculated. Results represent the mean of three independent experiments. SnoN Is Sumoylated at Lys-50 and Lys-383 in HEK293T Cells—To determine whether SnoN is SUMO-1 modified, HEK293T cells were transfected with His-SnoN and FLAG-SUMO-1. His-SnoN proteins were precipitated with Ni-NTA-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting. Co-transfection of SnoN and SUMO-1 resulted in the detection of two protein bands of ∼100 and ∼120 kDa using anti-SUMO antibody (Fig. 1A, lower panel) and two protein species in addition to free SnoN using anti-SnoN antibody (Fig. 1A, upper panel). As SUMO-1 often migrates at 20 kDa, the 100–120-kDa bands likely represent conjugation of one or two SUMO-1 molecules to SnoN. About 30% of SnoN was sumoylated under these conditions, and the smaller SnoN-SUMO product appears to be the predominant species. In addition, His-SnoN transfected in the absence of SUMO-1 appears to be modified by endogenous SUMO, as judged by two protein species in addition to free SnoN (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lane 1). These proteins are marginally smaller than corresponding modified SnoN in lane 3 due to the higher molecular weight of exogenous FLAG-tagged-SUMO-1. The additional species in lane 1 are not detected by αSUMO blotting, likely as this antibody is less sensitive than αSnoN. The sequence around SnoN Lys-50 and Lys-383 matches the sumoylation consensus motif ΨKXE(Ψ = a hydrophobic amino acid; X = any amino acid). Thus, we created SnoN mutants where these lysines, individually or together, were mutated to similarly charged arginine. Mutation of Lys-50 (SnoN(K50R)) abolished the smaller SnoN-SUMO conjugate (Fig. 1B, lane 4), whereas mutation of Lys-383 (SnoN(K383R)) abolished the larger SnoN-SUMO conjugate (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Simultaneous mutation at both sites (SnoN(K50R/K383R)) completely abolished SnoN sumoylation (Fig. 1B, lane 6). These data suggest that SnoN is SUMO-modified predominantly at Lys-50, and to a lesser extent, at Lys-383. We also tested two other SnoN mutants that had three or five lysine residues mutated. SnoN(K1–5R) contains lysines 383, 407, 423, 427, and 432 mutated to arginine (9Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and not surprisingly, resulted in loss of the SnoN-SUMO species corresponding to Lys-383 but not Lys-50 (Fig. 1B, lane 7). SnoN(K6–8R) carries mutation at lysines 440, 446, and 449, which represent the acceptor lysines for ubiquitin (9Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations did not disrupt SnoN sumoylation, suggesting that SUMO and ubiquitin are accepted by different lysine residues in SnoN. Endogenous SnoN Is Sumoylated— We next examined the SUMO conjugation of endogenous SnoN. Endogenous SnoN was enriched by anti-SnoN immunoprecipitation from 293T cells followed by anti-SnoN and anti-SUMO Western blot analysis. SnoN sumoylation was detectable in the anti-SnoN immunoprecipitates but not in the immunoprecipitates using control IgG (Fig. 1C). By carrying out a reverse experiment, we found that immunoprecipitation using anti-SUMO antibodies could also bring down the SnoN-SUMO conjugate that forms on Lys-50 (Fig. 1D). Taken together, our data suggest that endogenous SnoN is SUMO-modified and that SUMO-1 is predominantly conjugated to SnoN at lysine 50. PIAS1, xα, and xβ Promote SnoN Sumoylation—We next analyzed SnoN SUMO modification in an in vitro sumoylation assay using recombinant SnoN, SUMO-1, E1, E2, and ATP. No SnoN sumoylation was observed in the absence of E3 ligase (Fig. 2A, lane 3). We then tested two types of SUMO E3 ligase, including all five PIAS family members (1, 3, xα, xβ, and y) and RanBP2, in SnoN sumoylation. Anti-SnoN Western blotting detected free SnoN and ∼100-kDa SUMO-conjugated SnoN in the presence of PIAS1, xα, and xβ (Fig. 2A, lanes 4, 6, and 7). We also analyzed the SnoN sumoylation sites in vitro. The presence of PIASxβ (Fig. 2B)-, PIASxα-, or PIAS1 (data not shown)-induced sumoylation of wild-type SnoN and SnoN(K383R) but not SnoN(K50R) or SnoN(K50R/K383R). These data suggest that SnoN is modified at Lys-50 in the presence of PIAS1, xα, and xβ. Sumoylation at Lys-383 was undetectable in vitro, suggesting that an additional cellular factor is critical for SnoN sumoylation at Lys-383 and that Lys-50 is the major SnoN sumoylation site. To confirm the importance of PIAS E3 ligases in SnoN sumoylation, we tested the effect of PIAS1, xα, and xβ on SnoN sumoylation in vivo. PIASxβ enhanced Lys-50 sumoylation (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 8), and PIAS1 and PIASxα, but not PIAS3, similarly influenced SnoN sumoylation (data not shown). Our data suggest that PIAS1, xα, and xβ function as SnoN-SUMO E3 ligases (Fig. 2; data not shown). This is similar to our findings that these PIASs are E3 ligases for Smad4 (13Liang M. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22857-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and CtBP1 (14Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). SnoN Interacts with PIAS Proteins—As SUMO E3 ligases bind to their substrates to promote sumoylation, we determined whether SnoN and PIAS proteins physically interact. Immunoprecipitation revealed that SnoN physically interacts with PIAS1 and PIAS3 (Fig. 3A) as well as PIASxα, PIASxβ, and PIASy (Fig. 3B). A GST-SnoN fusion protein was able to bind all five PIAS proteins and the positive control Smad3 (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–6) but not GFP (Fig. 3C, lane 7, indicated by an arrow). Thus, SnoN and all PIAS proteins specifically interact, although only PIAS1, xα, and xβ exhibited SnoN SUMO E3 ligase activity (Fig. 2A). The SnoN interaction with PIAS3 and PIASy may have an alternative function to sumoylation, such as altering the ability of SnoN to repress TGF-β-mediated transcription, given that PIASs are also transcriptional regulators independently of sumoylation (11Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Sumoylation Does Not Alter SnoN-mediated Repression of TGF-β Signaling or SnoN Stability—SnoN is a critical repressor of TGF-β signaling. As sumoylation often alters the transcriptional properties of target proteins, we were interested in determining whether SUMO modification of SnoN affected its ability to repress TGF-β signaling. We first used SBE-luc, a TGF-β-responsive synthetic reporter gene dependent on Smad activation, to compare the effects of wild-type SnoN and SnoN(K50R) as Lys-50 appears to be the major SnoN sumoylation site (Fig. 1A). TGF-β induced ∼9-fold increase in SBE-luc activity in HaCaT cells, and SUMO-1 further increased TGF-β-induced activity (Fig. 4A) as reported previously (12Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SnoN and SnoN(K50R) repressed TGF-β-induced SBE-luc activity to a similar extent in the presence or absence of SUMO-1 (Fig. 4A). We next compared the effects of SnoN and SnoN(K50R/K383R) on the activity of natural TGF-β-responsive p21 and cyclin A promoters. TGF-β induced ∼2-fold increase in p21-luc activity, and SnoN and SnoN(K50R/K383R) were able to repress this to a similar extent (Fig. 4B). They were also able to block TGF-β-induced repression of cyclin A-luc equally (Fig. 4C). In addition, we found that Smad3 interacts with both SnoN and SnoN(K50R) in vivo (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, Smad3 retains its ability to bind to SnoN-SUMO conjugate in addition to free SnoN (Fig. 4E). As SnoN binds directly to Smads to inhibit their activity (1Luo K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the data in Fig. 4 suggest that sumoylation of SnoN is unlikely to alter its ability to repress TGF-β signaling. We next examined the effect of Smad3 on the stability of SnoN and SnoN(K50R). Previous studies showed that Smad2/3 accelerate SnoN degradation through recruitment of the E3 ligase Smurf2 or the anaphase-promoting complex (8Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 9Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wan Y. Liu X. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1027-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We transfected HEK293T cells with HA-SnoN or HA-SnoN(K50R) in the presence of FLAG-SUMO-1 (to ensure a high level of sumoylation on wild-type SnoN) and compared wild type and SnoN(K50R) in the presence or absence of Smad3. Co-transfection with Smad3 promoted degradation of SnoN as expected (Fig. 5A, compare lane 3 with lane 1) and also degradation of SnoN(K50R) (Fig. 5A, compare lane 7 with lane 5). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocks protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; thus, an increase or restoration of protein levels in its presence provides proof that the protein undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The Smad3-induced decrease in both SnoN and SnoN(K50R) was partially restored by the addition of the proteasome-inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 8). Most significantly, under the above conditions, a similar trend was observed for the SnoN-SUMO(K50) conjugate (wild-type SnoN-transfected cells only) and the SnoN-SUMO(K383) conjugate (SnoN- and SnoN(K50R)-transfected cells). Taken together, these data suggest that wild-type SnoN, SnoN(K50R), and the SnoN-SUMO conjugates (at both Lys-50 and Lys-383) are all equally turned over in the cell by the proteasome degradation pathway in the presence of Smad3. SUMO modification often alters protein stability as ubiquitin and SUMO-1 may compete for the same lysine residue (11Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Although the major sumoylation site (Lys-50) and ubiquitination sites (Lys-440, Lys-446, and Lys-449) of SnoN do not overlap, sumoylation could cause a SnoN conformational change to alter its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To exclude this, we examined SnoN and SnoN(K50R) ubiquitination. SnoN and SnoN(K50R) were ubiquitinated to a similar extent (Fig. 5B), indicating that sumoylation does not alter the ubiquitination potential of SnoN. We then examined SnoN and SnoN(K50R) turnover using a pulse-chase assay. HEK293T cells were transfected with wild-type FLAG-SnoN or FLAG-SnoN(K50R) and pulsed with [35S]methionine. FLAG-SnoN was then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 5C, 35S-labeled SnoN (upper panel, left) and SnoN(K50R) (lower panel, left) levels decrease similarly over time. Quantification shows that both SnoN and SnoN(K50R) have a half-life of around 5 h (Fig. 5C, right), as has been previously reported for wild-type SnoN (9Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, SnoN sumoylation neither regulates its stability nor impacts TGF-β signaling. Loss of SnoN Lys-50 Sumoylation Enhances Its Myogenic Potential—Overexpression of Ski/SnoN in muscle precursor cells induces myogenic marker gene expression and formation of multinucleated myotubes typical of differentiation (2Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Cell. 1989; 59: 293-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3Boyer P.L. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Hughes S.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether SnoN sumoylation may regulate its role in myogenesis. As TGF-β inhibits myogenesis (15Massague J. Cheifetz S. Endo T. Nadal-Ginard B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8206-8210Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 16Liu D. Black B.L. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we confirmed that sumoylation did not alter SnoN-mediated repression of TGF-β signaling in C2C12 cells using the SBE-luc reporter (supplemental Fig. S2). To investigate the role of SnoN sumoylation in muscle differentiation, we expressed SnoN or SnoN(K50R) cDNA in C2C12 myoblasts and compared their effects in myogenic differentiation. In myogenic reporter assays, which can monitor the activation of myogenic transcription factors such as MyoD, SnoN(K50R) induced a significantly higher 4xRTK-luc activity than SnoN and SnoN(K383R) (Fig. 6A). The K50R mutant is also more potent in its synergistic effect with MyoD than SnoN (presumably a mix of free and SUMO-modified forms) in inducing 4xRTK-luc reporter expression. In addition, SnoN(K50R) mutated at residues 89–92 (SnoN(K50R/Δ89–92)), the SnoN amino acids required for SnoN-Smad3 interactions, enhances 4xRTK-luc activity more than wild-type SnoN and similarly to SnoN(K50R) (supplemental Fig. S2). These data suggest that SnoN is more myogenic when it cannot be sumoylated at Lys-50 and that the increased myogenic potential of SnoN(K50R) does not depend on SnoN-Smad3 binding and thus may be independent of TGF-β signaling. C2C12 cells differentiate into multinucleated myotubes when cultured in differentiation medium for several days. After 5 days in differentiation medium, cells were fixed and stained for MHC, a late marker of differentiation predominantly expressed in myotubes. SnoN induced a higher degree of MHC staining and myotube formation than vector, consistent with reports that SnoN promotes myogenesis (3Boyer P.L. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Hughes S.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of SnoN(K50R) resulted in twice as many MHC-stained myotubes and twice as many multinucleated myotubes than for SnoN-expressing cells (Fig. 6, B–D). These morphological data further suggest that loss of sumoylation enhances the myogenic potential of SnoN. We next determined whether endogenous MHC and myogenin (muscle-specific proteins) levels were affected by SnoN(K50R) during C2C12 differentiation. MHC was expressed at day 2 of differentiation and increased at days 3 and 4 (Fig. 6E). Expression of SnoN or SnoN(K383R) resulted in higher expression of MHC than vector alone, and cells expressing SnoN(K50R) expressed ∼1.9 times more MHC at days 3 and 4 of differentiation than those expressing SnoN or SnoN(K383R) (Fig. 6E). This agrees with the higher level of MHC myotube staining in cells expressing SnoN(K50R) than SnoN (Fig. 6B). The trend for MHC protein levels was apparent for myogenin, although myogenin was not initially observed until day 3 (Fig. 6E, top panel). If Lys-50 sumoylation negatively impacts myogenesis, deletion of the first 50 amino acids of SnoN (SnoNΔ50) might also promote myogenesis similar to SnoN(K50R). Cells expressing SnoNΔ50 showed a level of MHC and myogenin similar to cells expressing SnoN(K50R), ruling out that the increased myogenic potential of SnoN(K50R) is simply due to the presence of an arginine at amino acid position 50 (Fig. 6E). Thus, although SnoN enhances myogenesis, SnoN(K50R) and SnoNΔ50 further stimulate myogenic marker expression at days 3 and 4 of differentiation. Finally, to confirm that a function for SnoN sumoylation in myoblasts is physiologically relevant, we sought to determine whether SnoN was sumoylated in C2C12 cells. C2C12 cells were co-transfected with His-SnoN and FLAG-SUMO-1. His-SnoN proteins were precipitated with Ni-NTA-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting. As for HEK293T cells in Fig. 1, co-transfection of SnoN and SUMO-1 in C2C12 cells resulted in detection of a protein of ∼100 kDa using anti-SUMO antibody (Fig. 7A, lower panel) and of a protein species in addition to free SnoN using anti-SnoN antibody (Fig. 7A, upper panel). Mutation of Lys-50 (SnoN(K50R); SnoN(K50R/K383R)) completely abolished the SnoN-SUMO conjugate (Fig. 7A, lanes 4 and 6). The SnoN sumoylation at Lys-383 we detected in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1) was barely detectable in C2C12 cells, suggesting that SnoN is SUMO-modified predominantly at Lys-50 in C2C12 cells. To further demonstrate the physiological relevance of SnoN sumoylation in C2C12 cells, we immunoprecipitated endogenous SnoN from C2C12 cell lysates using an anti-SnoN antibody. Western blot analysis of products using anti-SUMO antibody revealed that SnoN is SUMO-modified at the endogenous level (Fig. 7B). No band was detected in the IgG lane. Conversely, we immunoprecipitated endogenous free SUMO and SUMO-conjugated proteins from C2C12 cell lysates using anti-SUMO antibody. Western blot analysis of products using anti-SnoN antibody reveals that SnoN is a SUMO-conjugated protein in C2C12 cells (Fig. 7C). No band was detected in the IgG control lane. The data in Fig. 6 strikingly suggest that ablation of the SnoN Lys-50 sumoylation site enhances its ability to promote C2C12 cell differentiation. A proportion of SnoN proteins exist as SnoN-SUMO conjugates in C2C12 cells (Fig. 7B) and may need to be desumoylated at Lys-50, by unknown SUMO proteases, to have full myogenic potential. To address whether SnoN sumoylation fluctuates during skeletal muscle differentiation, C2C12 cells were transfected with His-SnoN and FLAG-SUMO. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection or differentiation for 1 or 2 days. His-tagged proteins were precipitated with Ni-NTA agarose, and SnoN sumoylation was determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 7D, SnoN sumoylation slightly decreases during differentiation, consistent with the finding that SnoN(K50R) has greater myogenic potential than wild-type SnoN. The significance of the decrease in SnoN-SUMO at day 2 of differentiation is partially masked by the fact that there is a greater level of total SnoN in this lane due to sample overloading. Taken together, the data in Fig. 7 suggest that SnoN is sumoylated at Lys-50 in C2C12 cells and that our data showing a negative role for SnoN sumoylation in C2C12 cell myogenesis are physiologically relevant. This notion is consistent with Ski being more myogenic than SnoN (3Boyer P.L. Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Hughes S.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar) as the Lys-50 sumoylation site is located in the N-terminal 69-amino-acid-long extension of SnoN, which is absent in c-Ski (17Nomura N. Sasamoto S. Ishii S. Date T. Matsui M. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5489-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As sumoylation is inhibitory, SnoN(K50R) and SnoNΔ50 may promote myogenesis similarly to Ski. Our current study describes the SUMO modification on oncoprotein SnoN and provides the underlying mechanism of how SUMO modification selectively regulates cell differentiation but not the transforming activity (the ability to inhibit TGF-β/Smad signaling) of SnoN. Our finding that SnoN is SUMO-modified is one example of how SnoN activity, as opposed to stability, is posttranslationally regulated. We ruled out the possibility that SnoN(Lys-50) promotes myogenesis through altered acetylation or increased SnoN stability. Under the conditions suitable for p53 acetylation, SnoN is apparently not acetylated (supplemental Fig. S1). With regard to ubiquitination, the major site of SnoN sumoylation (Lys-50) and the ubiquitin acceptor sites are independent, and Lys-50 sumoylation does not indirectly regulate SnoN stability as wild-type SnoN, SnoN(K50R), and SnoN-SUMO conjugates are similarly degraded by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway (Fig. 5). Although the Lys-50 sumoylation site is close to the Smad3-interacting region (amino acids 89–92) of SnoN (9Stroschein S.L. Bonni S. Wrana J.L. Luo K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2822-2836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TGF-β inhibits muscle differentiation via Smad3, which interacts with and inhibits myogenic MyoD (16Liu D. Black B.L. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), SnoN sumoylation had no effect on its ability to interact with Smad3 or repress TGF-β signaling (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, SnoN sumoylation must influence myogenesis by a TGF-β-independent mechanism. Further analysis revealed that sumoylation appears not to regulate the subcellular localization of SnoN (supplemental Fig. S3) or its interaction with MyoD (supplemental Fig. S4). Whether SnoN sumoylation indirectly influences assembly of the MyoD-containing transcription activator complex on chromatin awaits further investigation. Addendum—While this manuscript was in preparation, a similar study reported that SnoN sumoylation negatively regulates myogenin transcription in differentiating muscle cells (18Hsu Y.H. Sarker K.P. Pot I. Chan A. Netherton S.J. Bonni S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33008-33018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which agrees with our conclusion.

https://openalex.org/W1967446777,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a noninhibitory serpin found in plasma and in the extracellular space. The protein is involved in different biological processes including cell differentiation and survival. In addition, it is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. The function is likely associated with binding to cell surface receptors in a heparin-dependent way (Alberdi, E. M., Weldon, J. E., and Becerra, S. P. (2003) BMC Biochem. 4, 1). We have investigated the structural basis for this observation and show that heparin induces a conformational change in the vicinity of Lys178. This structural change was evident both when binding to intact heparin and specific heparin-derived oligosaccharides at physiological conditions or simply when exposing PEDF to low ionic strength. Binding to other glycosaminoglycans, heparin-derived oligosaccharides smaller than hexadecasaccharides (dp16), or type I collagen did not affect the structure of PEDF. The conformational change is likely to expose the epitope involved in binding to the receptor and thus regulates the interactions with cell surface receptors. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a noninhibitory serpin found in plasma and in the extracellular space. The protein is involved in different biological processes including cell differentiation and survival. In addition, it is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25992-25999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The protein was initially identified as a factor produced by retinal pigmented epithelial cells that promotes neuronal differentiation of retinoblastoma cells (4Tombran-Tink J. Johnson L.V. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 1700-1707PubMed Google Scholar). PEDF is present in several ocular compartments including the retinal and ciliary epithelia, the cornea, and the vitreous fluid (5Barnstable C.J. Tombran-Tink J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2004; 23: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition, PEDF is found in a range of other tissues including the central nervous system, skeletal muscle, liver, heart, placenta, and blood (6Tombran-Tink J. Barnstable C.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 7Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The physiological functions of PEDF can be divided into neurotrophic/neuroprotective and antiangiogenic activities. These activities are exemplified by neurotropic activity at concentrations as low as 1 nm (4Tombran-Tink J. Johnson L.V. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 1700-1707PubMed Google Scholar) and by an in vitro antiangiogenic activity that supersedes angiostatin, thrombospondin-1, and endostatin (8Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Because PEDF is found in plasma at levels significantly above the physiological relevant concentrations (∼100 nm), the activity is likely to be tightly regulated (7Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of PEDF revealed two features that may be involved in the expression and regulation of PEDF activity: (i) the reactive center loop and (ii) an asymmetrical distribution of charged amino acid residues, producing basic and acidic regions at opposite poles of the protein (2Simonovic M. Gettins P.G. Volz K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11131-11135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This is unusual in a serpin structure and suggests functional importance. Indeed, it has been reported that PEDF binds to type I collagen (7Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Kozaki K.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of PEDF to an unidentified receptor on Y-79 retinoblastoma cells is mediated by heparin (14Alberdi E.M. Weldon J.E. Becerra S.P. BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that heparin functions as a co-factor or induces a conformational change exposing regions involved in the receptor binding. Heparin binding is known to induce a conformational change in antithrombin III of the coagulation cascade, where binding regulates the proteinase inhibitory activity of this serpin (15Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar).Here we have analyzed the heparin-induced structural change of PEDF using biochemical and biophysical methods. Collectively, the data suggest that the heparin interaction causes a localized conformational change in the vicinity of Lys178, which likely facilitates the interaction with cell surface receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Heparin, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, heparinase, ovalbumin, porcine trypsin, heparin-BSA, and o-phenylenediamine dichloride were from Sigma. PEDF and type I collagen were purified as described previously (7Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Petersen S.V.

(Alameda, CA), and hexadecasaccharide, (dp16) was from Dextra Laboratories Ltd. (Reading, UK).SDS-PAGE—Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in 5-15% gradient gels using the glycine/2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol-HCl buffer system (17Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar).N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—PEDF fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) (18Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and analyzed by automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems model 477A/120A protein sequencing system.Analysis of Conformational Changes by Limited Proteolysis—Increasing amounts of heparin, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, or collagen were added to PEDF (2 μg), and the samples were equilibrated for 1 h at 37 °C in 25 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl. Trypsin was added (enzyme:substrate 1:10 w/w), and the digestion was continued for 15 min at 37 °C. Prior to trypsin digestion, heparinase was added (0.5 unit) to some reactions. The trypsin digestions were stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2.5 mm final concentration).To analyze the effect of ionic strength, PEDF (2 μg) was digested with trypsin at a ratio of 1:40 (w/w) in 25 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing increasing amounts of NaCl (0-100 mm). The incubation was carried out for 15 min at 23 °C. The influence of heparin in these experiments was analyzed by preincubating PEDF (2 μg) with heparin (0.2 μg) for 30 min at 23 °C. The samples were then digested with trypsin in a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) in the presence of increasing amounts of NaCl (100-250 mm), in 20 μl for 15 min at 23 °C before the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2.5 mm final concentration). The reaction products from the proteolytic digests described above were analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE and in some cases by automated Edman degradation.The effects of specific heparin size variants were analyzed by preincubating PEDF (2 μg) and tetrasaccharides (dp4), octasaccharides (dp8), or hexadecasaccharides (dp16) at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl. After 1 h the samples were digested with trypsin (enzyme:substrate ratio 1:1, w/w) for 15 min in 20 μl at 23 °C.Fluorescence Equilibrium Denaturation Measurements and CD Spectroscopy—The data were collected in a LS55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a 310-400 nm range with excitation at 290 nm and 10 nm excitation and emission slits. All measurements were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaCl, or 100 mm NaCl and 2 mg/ml heparin and recorded as the average of three scans at 23 °C. PEDF (2 μg) in 120 μl(∼0.4 μm) was incubated in the presence of urea concentrations ranging from 0to6 m at 25 °C for 1 h before measurement was performed. The data were analyzed using the following equation for urea denaturation curves (19Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1970; 24: 1-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 20Mogensen J.E. Ipsen H.

Based on these data, the stability in the absence of urea ΔGwaterD-N can be calculated as follows. ΔGD−Nwater=1.36×(mD−N)×[urea50%] (Eq. 2) Nonlinear least-squares regression analysis of the data were carried out in Kaleidagraph, version 3.5 (Synergy Software).Far-UV CD spectra were recorded in a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Spectroscopic Co. Ltd.) from 200 to 250 nm using a 20 nm/min scanning speed and a resolution of 0.1 nm. The bandwidth was 1.0 nm and response time 2.0 s. Cuvettes of 1 mm path length were used. Four accumulations were averaged to yield the final spectra. All measurements were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaCl, or 100 mm NaCl and 2 mg/ml heparin. Buffer and heparin contributions were subtracted.Heparin Binding Assays—The interaction between PEDF and heparin or specific heparin-derived oligosaccharides were investigated by ELISA. Microtiter wells (Maxisorb, Nunc, Denmark) were coated with 0.1 μg/100 μl heparin-BSA conjugate in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, overnight at 23 °C. The wells were blocked using 200 μl of BSA (1%) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.6 (TBS), for 1 h at 23 °C and washed extensively (TBS containing 0.1% Tween). Serial dilutions of PEDF were added (100 μl/well) and left incubating for 1 h at 23°C. The wells were washed as described above, and bound PEDF was detected using a standard ELISA protocol, including PEDF antiserum (generated toward plasma purified PEDF), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and o-phenylenediamine dichloride as the substrate. Each data point was collected in duplicates at 450 nm using a plate reader (THERMOmax, Molecular Devices) operated in end point mode. The relative binding capacity of PEDF was estimated in the linear range of the binding curve.The interaction between PEDF and the heparin-derived oligosaccharides was examined using competition assays based on PEDF binding to heparin-BSA-coated microtiter wells. A fixed amount of PEDF (1 μg) was preincubated with increasing amounts of intact heparin or heparin-derived oligosaccharides, including tetrasaccharides (dp4), octasaccharides (dp8), and hexadecasaccharides (dp16) in 100 μl of TBS for 1 h before the addition to the wells. Wells were developed as described above and all data points were collected in duplicates.RESULTSThe Susceptibility of PEDF to Limited Trypsin Proteolysis Was Increased by Heparin—To investigate putative structural changes induced by ligand binding, PEDF was titrated with heparin, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, or collagen and studied by means of limited proteolysis. In the presence of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, and collagen, PEDF remained resistant to proteolysis (data not shown). However, heparin significantly modified the proteolytic susceptibility, and PEDF was readily cleaved into smaller fragments (Fig. 1). One fragment of 29 kDa migrated as a fuzzy band, and two smaller fragments of ∼23 kDa migrated as a closely spaced doublet. At increasing amounts of heparin, the rate of proteolysis was accelerated, as observed by a decrease in staining intensity of the band representing intact PEDF. The specificity of the interaction was verified by including heparinase in the reaction mixture prior to trypsin digestion, which reversed the effect of heparin (Fig. 1). Collectively, these data are consistent with a change in the PEDF structure following binding of heparin.Identification of the Initial Trypsin Cleavage Site—The PEDF fragments produced by limited digestion with trypsin were characterized by automated Edman degradation. The 29-kDa fragment produced the sequence Glu-Ile-Pro-Asp-Glu, suggesting that this band represents the C-terminal part of PEDF spanning Glu179-Pro399 (theoretical molecular mass 25 kDa) (Figs. 1 and 2). The fragment includes the N-linked glycan at Asn266 (7Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the fuzzy appearance in SDS-PAGE is likely caused by heterogeneity of the attached glycan (∼2 kDa) and/or C-terminal truncation at Arg380, Lys391,orArg397. The lower 23-kDa closely spaced doublet did not sequence during Edman degradation, suggesting that these fragments represents the pGlu-blocked N terminus of PEDF (7Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The theoretical molecular mass of the pGlu1-Lys178 fragment (20 kDa) corresponds well with the observed mass of 23 kDa (Fig. 1). The appearance of a doublet is most likely caused by C-terminal truncation. Taken together these data suggest that the initial trypsin cleavage occurs at Lys178-Glu179 (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Structural representation of PEDF. Schematic representation of PEDF (not to scale) depicts the location of the initial trypsin cleavage (Lys178-Glu179), as confirmed by Edman degradation. The residues involved in heparin binding (Lys127, Lys128, and Arg130) are indicated, as well as the three tryptophan residues present in the protein, including the surface-exposed Trp164.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Proteolytic Susceptibility of PEDF Is Affected by Ionic Strength—Because the interaction between PEDF and heparin is likely to be electrostatic in nature (12Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we tested whether the proteolytic susceptibility of PEDF was affected by the ionic strength of the buffer. In the presence of 100 mm NaCl the protein was resistant to cleavage by trypsin. However, in the absence of NaCl, PEDF was completely digested (Fig. 3). The digestion of PEDF at low ionic strength generated fragments similar to those observed during the digestion at physiological conditions in the presence of heparin (Fig. 1). The increase in proteolytic susceptibility at low ionic strength could be reversed by the addition of NaCl (data not shown). These findings show that the structure of PEDF in the vicinity of Lys178 is altered by low ionic strength and that the structural change is reversible.FIGURE 3Proteolytic fragmentation of PEDF is dependent on ionic strength. PEDF (2 μg) was subjected to proteolysis by trypsin (1:40 w/w ratio) in the presence of increasing NaCl (mm) concentrations as indicated. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The position of intact PEDF is shown by an arrow on the left. A reduction in ionic strength causes PEDF to become susceptible to proteolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Increase in Ionic Strength Can Reverse Heparin-induced Conformational Change in PEDF—As described above, the presence of heparin or low ionic strength induces a conformational change, rendering PEDF receptive to limited proteolysis. To investigate whether the two circumstances generated similar structural alterations, PEDF was titrated with NaCl in the presence of heparin and analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE following tryptic digestion (Fig. 4). It was apparent that an increase in the ionic strength reversed the effect of heparin and caused PEDF to become resistant to proteolysis at higher NaCl concentrations. Because the structural change induced by heparin is reverted by an increase in the salt concentration, it is likely that the structural change induced by heparin and low ionic strength is similar in nature. This is further supported by the fact that appearance of identical reaction products are obtained following limited proteolysis of PEDF at low ionic strength and in the presence of heparin (Figs. 1, 2, 3).FIGURE 4An increase of ionic strength reverts the heparin-induced conformational change of PEDF. PEDF (2 μg) was incubated with trypsin (2 μg) and heparin (0.2 μg) in the presence of increasing concentration of NaCl (mm) as indicated. Trypsin (2 μg) and PEDF (2 μg) are included as controls. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The result suggests that the addition of salt disrupts heparin binding and renders PEDF less prone to proteolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structural Analysis of PEDF Using Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence and CD Spectroscopy—To investigate the influence of heparin and ionic strength on the tertiary structure, we subjected PEDF to urea denaturation and monitored the structural impact by Trp fluorescence spectroscopy. The degree of unfolding was evaluated by the ratio of fluorescence at 335 nm (hydrophobic environment) and 355 nm (hydrophilic environment), determined to be the wavelengths of maximum intensity for native and fully unfolded PEDF, respectively (Fig. 5A). The fluorescence spectra of PEDF in the presence of (i) 100 mm NaCl, (ii) heparin and 100 mm NaCl, and (iii) 0 mm NaCl in the absence of denaturant were similar (data not shown). This observation shows that the overall structure of PEDF is maintained under all conditions. In the presence of 100 mm NaCl the [urea]50% value is 3.30 ± 0.02 m and the mD-N value is 2.11 ± 0.14 m-1, corresponding to a calculated stability (ΔGD-N) of 6.97 ± 0.63 kcal/mol (Fig. 5B). This value is within the range of typical globular proteins (5-15 kcal/mol) (21Pace C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). When heparin was included in the analysis, the [urea]50% value was slightly reduced to 3.03 ± 0.04 m with an mD-N value of 1.97 ± 0.21 m-1, corresponding to a stability of 5.97 ± 0.64 kcal/mol (Fig. 5B). In the absence of NaCl, the [urea]50% value was further reduced to 2.47 ± 0.03 m (mD-N value of 2.00 ± 0.17 m-1), corresponding to 4.94 ± 0.42 kcal/mol (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that the increase in proteolytic susceptibility observed at low ionic strength or in the presence of heparin at physiological conditions is the result of a localized structural change and not a global unfolding of the PEDF structure. This conclusion was further supported by CD spectroscopy, which revealed no significant change in the secondary structure of PEDF in the absence of NaCl or presence of heparin (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5Biophysical analysis of PEDF stability. A, fluorescence spectra of PEDF in the native state (0 m urea) and in the denatured state (6 m urea) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The spectra obtained for PEDF at 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl ± heparin were similar (not shown). Arrows indicate the peak position of the native state (335 nm) and denatured state (355 nm). B, titration of PEDF in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, by urea in the presence of 0 mm NaCl (○), 100 mm NaCl (□), or 100 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml heparin (▴). The level of denaturation is depicted as the ratio of the fluorescence signal obtained for native (335 nm) and fully unfolded (355 nm) PEDF. These data show that PEDF is destabilized by heparin and low ionic strength. C, far-UV CD spectra of PEDF (4 μm) in the presence and absence of NaCl (100 mm) and heparin (2 mg/ml) as indicated. Data represent the average of three spectra (0.2 nm steps). The spectra were corrected for the appropriate background contributions. No significant change in the secondary structure of PEDF is observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Heparin-derived Oligosaccharides Smaller than 8 Disaccharide Units (dp16) Do Not Bind to PEDF nor Induce a Conformational Change—The ability to induce a conformational change is likely to depend on the size of the heparin. To investigate this, PEDF was subjected to limited proteolysis in the presence of intact heparin or heparin-derived oligosaccharides, including tetrasaccharides (dp4), octasaccharides (dp8), and hexadecasaccharides (dp16). Only intact heparin and the hexadecasaccharides (dp16) accelerated proteolysis, consistent with a conformational change (Fig. 6). The tetrasaccharides (dp4) and octasaccharides (dp8) were apparently unable to coordinate the intramolecular interactions required for the conformational change to occur.FIGURE 6Effect of heparin-derived oligosaccharides on the proteolytic susceptibility of PEDF. PEDF (2 μg) was incubated with trypsin 1:1 (w/w) in the presence of 2 μg of intact heparin or heparin-derived oligosaccharides (tetrasaccharides (dp4), octasaccharides (dp8), hexadecasaccharides (dp16)) at physiological conditions. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Controls representing PEDF (2 μg) and trypsin (2 μg) in the presence and absence of heparin were included as indicated. Only intact heparin and hexadecasaccharides (dp16) render PEDF more susceptible to proteolysis by trypsin. Note that intact heparin interferes with the staining and prevents the detection of low molecular weight bands of trypsin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate whether the tetra- and octasaccharides were able to bind PEDF without inducing a conformational change as observed for intact heparin and the hexadecasaccharides, we used a heparin-based ELISA. As expected, PEDF bound intact heparin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). The binding of the oligosaccharides was evaluated in a competition format. Thus, the binding capacity of PEDF was reduced in the presence of intact heparin or hexadecasaccharides (dp16) (Fig. 7B). Conversely, the tetrasaccharides (dp4) and octasaccharides (dp8) did not prevent the binding of the PEDF to the heparin-coated microtiter wells (Fig. 7B). Collectively, these data suggest that only intact heparin and the hexadecasaccharide (dp16) were able to bind to PEDF and induce a conformational change.FIGURE 7Heparin binding assays. A, PEDF (▴) was added in increasing amounts to heparin-coated microtiter wells, and the binding was determined using a standard ELISA protocol. Each point represents the mean of duplicates. Conclusively, PEDF binds to immobilized heparin in a dose-dependent manner. B, before its addition to heparin-coated microtiter wells, PEDF (1 μg) was preincubated with increasing amounts of heparin (□) or heparin-derived oligosaccharides (tetrasaccharides (dp4) (•), octasaccharides (dp8) (○), and hexadecasaccharides (dp16) (▪)). Intact heparin and hexadecasaccharide (dp16) inhibit the binding of PEDF to the heparincoated surface. The smaller heparin derivatives, tetrasaccharide (dp4) and octasaccharide (dp8), fail to bind to PEDF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe binding of PEDF to a receptor on the cell surface of retinoblasoma Y-79 cells is significantly improved by the presence of heparin (14Alberdi E.M. Weldon J.E. Becerra S.P. BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the mechanism of enhanced receptor binding involves a structural change of PEDF (14Alberdi E.M. Weldon J.E. Becerra S.P. BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we have employed biochemical and biophysical methods to investigate this hypothesis. Limited proteolysis has previously been used as a tool to investigate the inhibitory capacity of bovine PEDF (3Becerra S.P. Sagasti A. Spinella P. Notario V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25992-25999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Wu Y.Q. Becerra S.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1984-1993PubMed Google Scholar). These studies concluded that bovine PEDF was resistant to proteolysis and only a single cleavage of Arg360-Leu361 within the reactive center loop was detected when the protein was treated with trypsin in the presence of 150 mm NaCl (3Becerra S.P. Sagasti A. Spinella P. Notario V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25992-25999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). 4Numbering of bovine PEDF is done by homology to the mature N terminus of the human protein: Gln1-Asn-Ala-...... -Gly-Thr397. As shown in this study, human PEDF is not cleaved, using similar conditions, most likely because the homologous peptide bond, His362-Leu363, is not a substrate for trypsin. However, we observed that PEDF became a substrate for trypsin in the presence of heparin, suggesting that the protein undergoes a conformational change. The addition of heparinase reversed this effect, supporting the fact that the altered proteolytic susceptibility was caused by the heparin-PEDF interaction. Interestingly, the interaction between PEDF and other identified binding partners, including type I collagen (7Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1992003026,"We recently described the identification of a novel isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, IDI2 in humans and mice. Our current data indicate that, in humans, IDI2 is expressed only in skeletal muscle. Expression constructs of human IDI2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can complement isomerase function in an idi1-deficient yeast strain. Furthermore, IDI2 has the ability to catalyze the isomerization of [14C]IPP to [14C]DMAPP. Enzyme kinetic analysis of partially purified IDI2 demonstrate the novel isozyme has a maximal relative specific activity of 1.2 × 10-1 ± 0.3 μmol min-1 mg-1 at pH 8.0 with a KIPPm value of 22.8 μm IPP. Both isozymes, IDI1 and IDI2 are localized to the peroxisome by a PTS1-dependent pathway. Finally, our data suggest that IDI2 is regulated independently from IDI1, by a mechanism that may involve PPARα.

Isoprenoids and isoprenoid-derived compounds play an essential role in all living systems. They provide a necessary function in the organization of many biological systems including membrane structure, signal transduction, and redox chemistry. Several of the important end products of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway include: prenylated proteins, dolichols, vitamins A, D, E, and K, steroid hormones, carotenoids, bile acids, and cholesterol (1Spurgin S.L. Porter J.W. Porter J.W. Spurgin S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. vol. 1. Wiley and Sons, Inc, New York1981: 2-46Google Scholar). In addition, this complex pathway also produces farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) 2The abbreviations used are: FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; IDI, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; QRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; RT, reverse transcriptase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and geranyl-geranyl diphosphate (GGPP), compounds required for the isoprenylation of various G proteins (2Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar). All isoprenoids are derived from the 5-carbon isoprene defined by isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its highly electrophilic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). The enzyme isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI1; EC 5.3.3.2) transforms unreactive IPP into its reactive isomer DMAPP by the concerted addition and abstraction of protons at C-4. These two isomers are the building blocks for the successive head-to-tail condensation reactions that result in the synthesis of geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C10) FPP (C15) and ultimately, non-sterol products and cholesterol (3Popjak G. Goodwin T.W. Natural Substances Formed Biologically from Mevalonic Acid. Academic Press, New York1970: 17-33Google Scholar). IDI1 first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Lynen F. Argranoff B.W. Eggerer H. Henning U. Moslein F.M. Angew. Chem. 1959; 71: 657-661Crossref Google Scholar) has since been characterized in numerous organisms including humans. Most recently, IDI1 has been identified in hamster and rat where it was shown to localize to the peroxisome by a Pex-5p-dependent PTS1 mechanism (5Paton V. Shackelford J.E. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18945-18950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Analysis of IDI1 in S. cerevisiae revealed two catalytically active amino acids, Cys139 and Glu207. Mutagenesis analysis in the yeast enzyme demonstrated that a C139S mutation resulted in a significant reduction in isomerase activity whereas a Cys to Val or Ala change at this site abolished activity completely (6Street I.P. Coffman H. Baker J.A. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4212-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several examples of multiple IDI isozymes have been reported in plants and algae. In Nicotiana tobacum, the two IDI isozymes are regulated at the transcriptional level under a variety of environmental conditions (7Nakamura A. Shimada H. Masuda T. Ohta H. Takamy K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar duplications exist in Cinchona robusta and the green alga Hematococcus pluvialis. Additionally, multiple isozymes of IDI have been identified in higher eukaryotes Sus domesticus and Gallus gallus. In all cases the isozymes maintain specialized functions by different expression patterns, subcellular localization, and susceptibility to inhibitors (8Bruenger E. Chayet L. Rilling H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Sagami H. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We previously reported a detailed phylogenetic and structural analysis of IDI2 (10Breitling R. Laubner D. Clizbe D. Adamski J. Krisans S.K. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling suggested that IDI2 is likely to perform functionally as an isomerase despite a Ser to Cys change within the putative active site. In the current study we present the biochemical and functional characterization of IDI2 in mammals. Our data illustrate that IDI2 has a distinct tissue expression pattern, has functional isomerase activity in vivo, a unique kinetic profile, and is targeted to the peroxisome by a PTS1-dependent pathway. Moreover, our results suggest that IDI2 in mice is regulated in an independent manner from its isozyme IDI1 and may play a significant role in isoprenoid metabolism in skeletal muscle. Northern Blot Analysis—Human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from Clontech. Each blot contained ∼2 μg of poly(A)+RNA. Hybridizations were performed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes. The [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes consisted of the 687-bp IDI1 and 684-bp IDI2 open reading frames. Standard procedures were followed for hybridization and washing. Membranes were exposed to a Phosphorimager screen (Molecular Dynamics). Dr. D. Shoemaker, Merck Pharmaceuticals, provided the real-time PCR data of human tissues. RNA Isolation—Cells for RNA isolation were harvested by trypsinization and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA isolation from murine muscle was performed on flash-frozen tissue with RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA Synthesis—cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen), Oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen), and total RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The transcription step was performed at 50 °C for 60 min. Yeast Expression Vectors—Human IDI1 and IDI2 cDNAs were amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Amplification products were cloned into pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO contains the URA3 gene for selection in yeast and 2-μ origin for high copy maintenance. TOPO cloning reaction was prepared according to the manufacturer’s recommendation using 1 μl each of the amplification products. 3 μl of each ligation reaction was used to transform One Shot Top 10 F′ (Invitrogen)-competent Escherichia coli. Colonies were selected on LB kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and recombinant plasmids isolated using Qiagen Miniprep Plasmid Isolation kit. Recombinant plasmids were screened by PCR with forward primers to the Gal1 region of pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO (5′-AATSTSCCTCTATACTTTAACGTC-3′) and reverse primers to the 3′-end of either IDI1 or IDI2, 5′-CATTTACCTCGAGATTCACATTCTG-3′ or 5′-CTCGAGGGCCTCTCACACTCTG-3′. Positive recombinants were verified by DNA sequencing in triplicate (Micro-CoreFacility, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA). Plasmid Shuffle—pYESIDI1 and pYESIDI2 were shuffled into haploid S. cerevisiae IDI1 deletion strain FH2-5b (generous gift of Dr. C. Dale Poulter, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT) by methods described previously (11Hahn F.M. Xuan J.W. Chambers A.F. Poulter C.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with few modifications. pYESIDI1 and pYESIDI2 were transformed into competent FH2-5b by the LiAc/TE/PEG method (Invitrogen). No pYESIDI1 double transformants were recovered. Following incubation at 30 °C for 3 days on solid SG-ura-leu-lys media, pYES IDI2 double transformants were washed from plates in SG (20% galactose) -ura-leu-lys media containing α-AA (3 mg/ml) transferred to α-AA-20% galactose (3 mg/ml) solid media plates and incubated at 30 °C for 72 h. Surviving colonies were then replica-plated on the same medium or solid α-AA medium containing glucose as the sole carbon source. This method selects for those colonies able to survive when the shuffled gene is actively transcribed but perishes when transcription is repressed by glucose. This method allowed the identification of true IDI2-positive shuffle transformants. Yeast Colony PCR—Colonies shown to survive on α-AA medium including galactose but not on α-AA medium including glucose were resuspended in 20 μl of dH20. 1 μl of a 1:10 dilution of these resuspensions were used in a 50-μl PCR reaction using pYes 2.1Gal1 forward primer 5′-AATATACCTCTATACTTTAACGTC-3′ and IDI2 reverse primer 5′-CACTCTGTGTATTTTGTGAAG-3′ (pYes 2.1IDI2) or pRS317IDI1 forward 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′ and pRS317IDI1 reverse 5′-CCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAG-3′. PCR conditions were 95° 5 min (1 cycle), 94° 30 s, 55° 45 s, 72° 1 min (35 cycles) 72° 5 min. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. hIDI2 Partial Purification—IDI2-expressing yeast cultures were centrifuged at 5000 rpm to pellet. Pellets were washed 2× in5mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0, and processed immediately or frozen at -70 °C. The remaining procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Frozen pellets were thawed, rinsed with 5 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol including protease inhibitors (Roche Protease Complete mini tablet). Acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were pre-rinsed with 5 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol plus protease inhibitors. Yeast pellet suspension was added and homogenized by repeated cycles of vortexing and chilling in an ice water bath (30 s each, 5 cycles). The homogenate was centrifuged (Bio-Rad, microcentrifuge) 3 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant collected. The homogenization procedure was repeated for a total of three times. Supernatants were brought to 55% by addition of solid ultra-pure ammonium sulfate (ICN) Precipitating proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was brought to 75% ammonium sulfate. Precipitating proteins were collected, resuspended in buffer plus 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm Pefabloc, 100 μm leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.28 μg/ml aprotinin, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C. Samples were collected and diluted with 10% glycerol and applied to a DEAE cellulose column equilibrated in buffer only. The binding proteins were eluted with a 0-0.5 m KPO4 gradient in buffer without protease inhibitors. Fractions containing IDI activity were pooled, diluted with water, and reapplied to a new DEAE column, and eluted with 0.5 m KPO4 to concentrate. The concentrated fractions were applied to a Sephacryl S-200 (Sigma) column in 5 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and fractions containing IDI activity located by enzymatic assay. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Analysis—SDS-PAGE was carried out on NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris 1.0 mm gel in MES SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions, then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) in NuPAGE transfer buffer using a XCell II Blot module(Invitrogen). Bound antibody was revealed by the addition of Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent PLUS (PerkinElmer) substrate. Isomerase Activity Assay—Isomerase activity was determined by a modified version of the assay as described by Satterwhite (12Satterwhite D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 92-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding enzyme to a prewarmed assay mixture followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.4 ml of 25% concentrated HCl in MeOH. 0.05 ml of [3H]FPP in 70% EtOH, 25 mm NH4HCO3 was added as a standard, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Each sample was extracted twice with 2.0-ml aliquots of petroleum ether. Measurements of isomerase activity were performed in triplicate and determined to be linear for all protein concentrations and time of incubation. EGFP Fusion Constructs—Full-length coding regions for human IDI1and IDI2 were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers that introduced unique 5′ BglII and 3′ KpnI restriction sites, IDI1 forward 5′-CCCATAGATCTGATCAGACATTTTGTAATGATG-3′, IDI2 forward 5′-AGGTCGGGTCAGATCTAGCAGCTAT-3′, IDI1 Reverse 5′-GTAATCAGGTACCTACATATTCAC-3′ IDI2 Reverse 5′-CATTACACATGGCTGACTGGTACCTCCCTGGCCTCTCA-3′. PTS1 deletion constructs were created by amplifying full-coding region template with reverse primers that added a unique KpnI restriction site and a TGA stop codon upstream of the final 3 amino acids IDI1ΔPTS1rev 5′-GTAATCAGGTACCTACATATTCACATTCTTCATATTTTCTC-3′ and IDI2 ΔPTS1rev-5′-TGGCTGACTGGTACCTCCCTGGCCTCTCACACTCTTCATAT-3′.The amplification products were subcloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen). The fragments were excised by restriction digest with BglII and KpnI. The excised fragments were cloned into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). The recombinant pEGFP constructs were then determined to be in-frame with the N-terminal EGFP, and the PTS1 deletions were confirmed in triplicate by DNA sequencing. Fluorescence Microscopy—Transfected cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips. 24 h post-transfection cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) with 0.5% n-propylgallate as anti-fade agent. Fluorescence was visualized using confocal micoscope (Leica). Quantitative Colocalization Analysis—Confocal images were transferred to a Macintosh PowerPC G4 (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) for analysis. Colocalization of fluorescent signal was evaluated quantitatively for Pearson’s correlation coefficient (Rr), Manders overlap coefficient using CoLocalizer Express (CoLocalizer Express Software, Boise, ID). At least three samples from each experiment were analyzed. Data were prepared as Excel and Image files. Microsoft Excel software was used to analyze Excel files. Animals—Mice, for each treatment group, were agematched male Black Swiss (Taconic), a cross between C57/BL6 and Swiss Webster (n = 5, for each treatment). Mice were sacrificed at ∼100 days of age, following the completion of experimental protocols. Tissues were immediately harvested, flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Mice Diets—All diets were administered for 30 days, ad libitum. HFD was Harlan Teklad’s special 1.25% cholesterol diet (TD96335). The statin diet was prepared with 0.1% simvastatin (Sigma-Aldrich). The fibrate diet was prepared with 0.2% gemfibrozil (Sigma-Aldrich). Quantitative Real-Time PCR—The mRNA levels were quantitated using a Bio-Rad iCyler. iQ SYBR Green supermix (BioRad) was used for all experiments. Experiments were done on 96-well plates (Axygen, Union City, CA). Each sample was run in triplicate and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The following primers were used: Mouse IDI1 Forward: 5′-GGTTCAGCTTCTAGCGGAGA-3′ and Reverse: 5′-TCGCCTGGGTTACTTAATGG-3′; Mouse IDI2 Forward: 5′-GATTGGCTACCTTCTGTTG-3′ and Reverse: 5′-CTGAACCAAGGGGTGATC-3′; Mouse HMGCR Forward: 5′-CTTGTGGAATGCCTTGTGATTG-3′ and Reverse: 5′-AGCCGAAGCAGCACATGAT-3′; Mouse GAPDH Forward: 5′-GTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3′ and Reverse: 5′-CAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3′. Mammalian Expression Vectors—Murine IDI1 and IDI2 cDNA was obtained using SuperScript, oligo(dT) primer, and total RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol. IDI2 was amplified from mouse neonate skeletal muscle cDNA with the following primers: 5′-CGGCGCTAGCACCATGGGATTTCCAGGCAAGCAAAACTCACCTT and 3′-CGGTCAAGATCACAGTCCATATATCTTGTCAGGCTCCAC. Cell Culture and Transfection Conditions—HeLa cells were maintained in Eagles Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) at 37° under 5% CO2. The mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 (American Tissue Culture Collection) was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum (SigmaAldrich), and fungizone and streptomycin. Cells were transected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Overexpression of IDI2 in C2C12 cells was verified by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Cholesterol Synthesis Assay—Cholesterol, fatty acid, and dolichol phosphate rate of synthesis was determined using the method previously described (13Aboushadi N. Krisans S.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1781-1791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 100-mm cell culture plates were seeded with 2 × 105 C2C12-transfected cells with either vector-only or pcDNA3.1IDI2 vector. After 24 h, plates were rinsed 3× in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated in LPDS medium for 24 h. Cellular Cholesterol Determination—Total cholesterol levels were determined by Michael J. Richards and Dr. Steven Fliesler (St. Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after saponification and petroleum ether extraction, as described previously (14Fliesler S.J. Richards M.J. Miller C. Peachey N.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1792-1801PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fliesler S.J. Richards M.J. Miller C.Y. Cenedella R. J. Lipids. 2000; 35: 289-296Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HMGCR Assay—HMGCR activity in C2C12 cells was determined as previously described (16Engfelt W.H. Shackelford J.E. Aboushadi N. Jessani N. Masuda K. Paton V.G. Keller G.A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24579-24587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: activity in the cellular extract was determined using 100 μg of protein, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Tissue Distribution of IDI2—To determine the expression pattern of IDI2 in human tissues, a commercially prepared multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was probed against both IDI1 and IDI2 32P-labeled cDNA (Fig. 1A). IDI1 expression is shown as a 2.4-kb transcript detectable in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver (Fig. 1A, panel a). In contrast, IDI2 is expressed as a 1.9-kb transcript that is detectable exclusively in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A, panel b). Simultaneous probing indicates that IDI2 is expressed at a notably higher level than IDI1 in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A, panel c). These data were confirmed in a variety of human tissues using quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) (Fig. 1B). In agreement with Northern data, the QRT-PCR data illustrate that IDI2 is present only in skeletal muscle and expressed at higher levels than IDI1. hIDI2 Functional Complementation of IDI1 in S. cerevisiae—The significant sequence similarity of the two isozymes, at both the amino acid and nucleotide level, led us to predict that IDI2 may retain functional isomerase activity despite a C86S change within the putative active site (10Breitling R. Laubner D. Clizbe D. Adamski J. Krisans S.K. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As described earlier, a C139S mutation in yeast, corresponding to the C86S in humans resulted in an inefficient yet still active enzyme. To investigate the in vivo isomerase activity of IDI2 we tested the ability of hIDI2 to functionally rescue a non-functional IDI1 by the plasmid shuffle technique (18Hahn F.M. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11298-11303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). IDI1 is an essential single copy gene in yeast, therefore the loss of episomal pRS317:IDI1 in the yeast strain FH25b is lethal unless functionally complemented by hIDI2. We were able to obtain transformants for IDI2 but were unsuccessful in recovering transformants for human IDI1. We confirmed the presence or absence of pRS317:IDI1 or pYES IDI2 in the positive shuffle transformants by PCR (Fig. 2A). Yeast colony PCR analysis shows the presence of IDI1 (lanes 2 and 3) and absence of IDI2 (lanes 4 and 5) in FH25b haploid yeast. In contrast, IDI2 is present (lanes 7 and 8), and IDI1 is absent in FH25bIDI2 (lanes 9 and 10). Western analysis of the soluble protein extracts demonstrates that a 31-kDa His-tagged IDI2 is expressed at high levels in FH25bIDI2 but not in FH25b (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that human IDI2 is functionally homologous to yeast IDI1. Kinetic Analysis of Recombinant Full-length Human IDI2 in FH25b—To determine the kinetic parameters of IDI2, we utilized the recombinant yeast strain FH25bIDI2 generated by plasmid shuffle, which is devoid of endogenous yeast IDI1. Partially purified IDI2 extracts were assayed in vitro for isomerase activity. Kinetic analysis indicates hIDI2 has maximal activity at pH 8.0 (Fig. 3A). Thus, all subsequent assays were carried out at pH 8.0. Our data show the optimal substrate concentration for IDI2 is 75 μm [14C]IPP (Fig. 3, panel B). Thus, the maximal relative specific activity for hIDI2 is 1.2 × 10-1 ± 0.3 μmol min-1 mg-1 at pH 8.0 with a KIPPm value of 22.8 μm IPP. Previous characterization of IDI1 in yeast showed that for maximum biological activity the enzyme requires a divalent metal as a cofactor (18Hahn F.M. Poulter C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11298-11303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, recently it has been shown that IDI1 isolated from E. coli has two metal binding sites; one site binds Mg2+ while the other is hypothesized to bind a Zn2+ atom (19Carrigan C.N. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9008-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine the requirement for metal cofactors for hIDI2 we measured the in vitro activity of hIDI2 in the presence of several divalent metals (Fig. 3, C-F). Our data indicate that highest maximal activity for IDI2 is seen at concentrations of 0.01 mm Mn2+. These results suggest Mn2+ may be the physiologically important cation for IDI2 (Fig. 3C). Subcellular Localization of hIDI2—IDI1 cloned from rat and hamster is localized to the peroxisome by a PTS1-dependent pathway (5Paton V. Shackelford J.E. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18945-18950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Human IDI1 has a putative C-terminal PTS1 (-YRM) which conforms to the “two out of three” rule for the adherence to the canonical consensus sequence for peroxisomal targeting (20Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W.T. van der Sluijs P. Diste B. Tabak H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26357-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, the sequence of human IDI2 contains a less stringent C-terminal PTS1 (-HRV). Previously, it has been shown that many non-canonical tripeptide combinations were able to target the enzyme malate dehydrogenase in S. cerevisiae to the peroxisome (20Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W.T. van der Sluijs P. Diste B. Tabak H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26357-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine the requirement for peroxisomal localization of the putative PTS1 at the C terminus of human IDI1 and IDI2, we generated EGFP fusion proteins of human IDI1 and IDI2, both as full-length and C-terminal tripeptide PTS1 deletion constructs. HeLa cells were co-transfected with the fusion constructs as well as the vector DsRed2peroxi. This vector contains the coding sequence of the red fluorescent protein DsRed1 from Discosomas p followed by a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence, SKL. Transient transfection of full-length IDI1-EGFP and IDI2-EGFP fusion constructs into HeLa cells resulted in a punctate expression pattern that was superimposable with the punctate pattern generated by pDsRed2peroxi in the same cell (Fig. 4, panels a-c, panels g-i). Moreover, correlation values (Pearson, Rr and Manders, R) indicate a significant degree of colocalization for both EGFPIDI1/DsRed2peroxi (Rr = 0.9098, r = 0.9099) and EGFPIDI2/DsRed2peroxi (Rr = 0.9454, r = 0.9454). Scatter plots (embedded in lower right of Fig. 4, panels c and i) estimate the amount of detected fluorescence based on localization of DsRedperoxi (red, y-axis) and EGFP (green, x-axis). Colocalized pixels (yellow) are located along the diagonal of the scatter gram. The scatter plots for full-length EGFP-IDI1 and EGFP-IDI2 indicate a yellow monopartite diagonal scatter pattern, which verifies the colocalization of both IDI1 and IDI2 with targeted DS2peroxi to peroxisomes. In contrast, transient transfections of the EGFP-PTS1 deletion constructs in HeLa cells resulted in a diffuse fluorescent pattern, which was cytosolic in distribution (Fig. 4, panels d and j), while the fluorescent pattern for DsRed2peroxi remained punctate (Fig. 4, panels e and k). Furthermore, superimposed images indicate that PTS1 deletions in IDI1 and IDI2 obviate co-localization with DsRed2peroxi (Fig. 4, panels f and l). Colocalization correlation values for both EGFPIDI1ΔPTS1/DsRed2peroxi and EGFPIDI2ΔPTS1/DsRed2peroxi co-transfected cells were greatly reduced compared with values for full-length constructs (Rr = 0.3099. r = 0.3098; Rr = 0.2671, r = 0.2670). Scatter plots for ΔPTS1-expressing cells (panels f and l, embedded lower right) show a bipartite distribution along the x (green, EGFP) and y (red, DsRed2peroxi) axes, indicating extremely low levels of colocalization. Taken together, these data demonstrate the localization of full-length human IDI1 and IDI2 to peroxisomes and show that this targeting is mediated by C-terminal PTS1 sequence. Regulation of IDI2 in Mice—The muscle-specific expression of IDI2 in combination with demonstrable isomerase activity led us to hypothesize that IDI2 may play a unique role in the isoprenoid pathway in muscle. Our previous work suggested that IDI2 may be a factor in muscle-specific pathologies, such as rhabdomyolysis stemming from treatment with statins (simvastatin), a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that act specifically as HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors (10Breitling R. Laubner D. Clizbe D. Adamski J. Krisans S.K. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To address the effect on IDI2 transcription in skeletal muscle in the presence of statins, we measured mRNA levels of IDI1, IDI2, and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) by quantitative real time PCR (QRT-PCR) in murine muscle tissue (hind limb). mRNA levels were measured following treatment with statins as well as fibrates, another class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that has been shown to cause rhabdomyolysis in some patients (21Brunmair B.

Additionally we measured the effect on IDI1, IDI2, and HMGCR mRNA levels following high fat (HFD) and fasted diets. Modified dietary regimes, including high fat and fasted diets, have been shown to modulate transcription of genes involved in isoprenoid and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle (22Hildebrandt A.L. Neufer P.D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol Metab. 2000; 278: E1078-E1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cameron-Smith D. Burke L.M. Angus D.J. Tunstall R.J. Cox G.R. Bonen A. Hawley J.A. Hargreaves M.A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2003; 77: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that IDI2 mRNA levels were significantly reduced under statin (51% p < 0.05) and fibrate (51% p < 0.05) treatments (Fig. 5A). In contrast, mRNA levels of IDI1 and HMGCR were unchanged under either treatment (Fig. 5A). In addition, IDI2 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle following HFD were also significantly reduced (65%, p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, IDI1 transcription following HFD was significantly increased (209%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). Measurements of mRNA transcription following a fasted regime demonstrate a significant down-regulation of IDI1 (65%, p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 5A). IDI2 and HMGCR transcription levels showed no significant change with this treatment. Taken together, these data suggest a regulatory difference for the three genes in skeletal muscle. mIDI2 Overexpression in C2C12 Cells—To further explore the function of IDI2, and address the effect of IDI2 overexpression on sterol and non-sterol products downstream of the isoprenoid pathway, mammalian expression constructs were designed to constitutively express murine IDI2. These constructs were stably transfected into mouse myoblast C2C12 cells. The rate of sterol (cholesterol) and non-sterol (dolichols, fatty acids) biosynthesis was determined.

Previously, we suggested that this membrane is unusual in that it lacks several typical BM components, e.g. collagen IV, laminin B, perlecan, and fibronectin (Hummel, S., Osanger, A., Bajari, T. M., Balasubramani, M., Halfter, W., Nimpf, J., and Schneider, W. J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 23486–23494). We have now identified a novel chondroitin sulfate-modified collagen, tentatively termed ggBM1 (Gallus gallus basement membrane protein1) as a major component of the border between the vascularized theca and the epitheloid granulosa cells. In biosynthetic experiments using [3H]proline and [35S]sulfate, ggBM1 was shown to be synthesized by and secreted from the granulosa cells that support the developing oocyte. The acidic heterogeneous 135-kDa proteoglycan was converted to a protein with an apparent Mr of 95,000 by treatment with chondroitinase ABC and was completely degraded by collagenase. Sequencing of tryptic fragments revealed peptides typical of collagens. The follicular BM accumulated apolipoprotein B and apo-VLDLII, the major resident proteins of the yolk precursor very low density lipoprotein. Interestingly, and likely indicating an analogous situation to the follicle, ggBM1 is also a component of Bruch’s membrane of the eye, which separates the vascularized choroid from retinal pigmented epithelial cells. Based on our data we propose that in addition to thecal perlecan, ggBM1 is involved in the transfer of yolk precursors from the thecal capillary bed to oocyte surface lipoprotein receptors mediating their uptake into oocytes.

During the development of ovarian follicles in oviparous species, the formation and maintenance of extracellular matrices and laminar structures for mechanical support are important processes. The coordinated regulation of the synthesis of their components and assembly is one of the prerequisites for the normal growth of the follicles' central giant germ cell, the oocyte. In the final 7-day period of rapid growth of the chicken oocyte, it is surrounded by a concentric arrangement, from the periphery inwards, of (i) vascularized connective tissue representing an extension of the follicle stalk, (ii) the theca proper, which consists of the theca externa, a broad layer of stratified cells with embedded capillaries, and the narrower theca interna, (iii) an acellular layer commonly designated as basal lamina (1Asem E.K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 39: 257-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), poses the question as to how these large complex molecules gain access to the oocytic plasma membrane in the core of the follicle. Detailed ultrastructural studies in the late 1970s (16Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. Evans A.J. J. Anat. 1978; 125: 481-497PubMed Google Scholar) established that the endothelium of capillaries within the theca layer shows extensive fenestrae with widths of up to 50 nm, many of which appear to provide direct access from the lumen to the pericapillary space. Thus, when macromolecules are released from the capillaries, they first encounter extracellular matrices, from where they diffuse across the basement membrane, through gaps between granulosa cells and past the zona pellucida, to home in on the above described high affinity endocytic receptors in the oocyte plasma membrane. The membranous structure separating granulosa cells from theca interna has been shown to be permeable to serum-derived VLDL particles (2Evans A.J. Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 573: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Shen X. Steyrer E. Retzek H. Sanders E.J. Schneider W.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These and other studies suggested that the high concentration of the particles residing within the membrane, which we term “basement membrane” (BM) in this report, is related to its capacity to become saturated with VLDL, thus facilitating penetration of the particles in the fluid phase to the oocyte surface (4Shen X. Steyrer E. Retzek H. Sanders E.J. Schneider W.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).While it is widely assumed that the BM is composed of the typical BM components, our factual knowledge about the composition of this membrane is very limited (2Evans A.J. Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 573: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Perry M.M. Gilbert A.B. J.

The above considerations raise the possibility that negatively charged macromolecular structures (e.g. acidic proteoglycans) interact with the positively charged apolipoprotein B-100, the major protein component of VLDL. Thus, based on the generally accepted fact that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan, is an important functional component of typical basement membranes, we have recently molecularly characterized chicken perlecan (18Hummel S.

One of the domains of chicken perlecan, which contains a cluster of four lipoprotein binding repeats typical of the LR gene family, indeed interacts with serum VLDL (18Hummel S. Osanger A.

Surprisingly, while perlecan has been well conserved in a wide range of species, and is synthesized by theca cells, it clearly is absent from the follicular BM (18Hummel S. Osanger A. Bajari T.M. Balasubramani M. Halfter W. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23486-23494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Agrin, laminin B, fibronectin, and syndecan-1/syndecan-3 are also not found in this membrane. Perlecan likely constitutes a transient storage site for VLDL in the thecal matrix, where its multistep pathway for ultimate uptake into the oocytic yolk compartment is initiated (18Hummel S. Osanger A. Bajari T.M. Balasubramani M. Halfter W. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23486-23494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Thus, studies to date have not led to the unambiguous identification of any of the molecules constituting the follicular BM. In the current study, we have isolated this unique matrix and addressed its biochemical characterization. We show that the main component is a chondroitin sulfate-modified collagen, possibly related to type IX collagen, which is synthesized by and secreted from granulosa cells. The origin and properties of this molecule provide an explanation for the mechanical strength and plasticity of the BM during oocyte growth as well as for its ability to interact with VLDL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Animals and Antibody Preparation—Mature Derco-brown laying hens (Heindl Co., Vienna, Austria) and quail hens (Coturnix coturnix) were maintained on layer’s mash with free access to feed and water under a daily light period of 16 h. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Antibodies were produced in adult female New Zealand White rabbits (18Hummel S. Osanger A. Bajari T.M. Balasubramani M. Halfter W. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J.

All procedures were performed according to the protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Medical University of Vienna.

Follicles were punctured with sterile forceps, yolk was squeezed out, and the GC sheets were extruded. The sheets were washed several times in 10 ml of PBS (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm NaHPO4, 100 mm NaCl) until the residual yolk was removed and subsequently incubated in buffer containing 0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, and 5 mm ETDA for 30 min at room temperature. The BM and the zona pellucida (ZP) were separated mechanically under a light-microscope using sharp forceps. The ZP was sedimented by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The two membranes were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and were stored at –20 °C. The residual follicular thecal portion was washed in PBS, transferred to 5 ml of 8 m urea, and homogenized for 1 min using an Ultra Turrax T25 homogenizer. The homogenate was incubated at room temperature overnight and was then centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min) to remove debris and non-dissolved material.Enzymatic Treatment of ggBM1 Protein—The isolated BM or ZP (as indicated) were incubated with heparinase I (from Flavobacterium heparinum; Sigma catalog number H2519), heparinase III (from F. heparinum; Sigma catalog number H8891), chondroitinase ABC (from Proteus vulgaris, Sigma catalog number C2905), hyaluronidase (from bovine testes or from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus; Calbiochem catalog numbers 385931 and 389561), collagenase IV (from Clostridium histolyticum; Sigma catalog number C5138) or in buffer alone according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Following incubations, the samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE.Metabolic Labeling of GC Sheets with Na235SO4 or with l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Proline and Immunoprecipitation—For metabolic labeling, freshly isolated GC sheets were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 120 μCi/ml Na235SO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 250 μCi/ml l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline (Amersham Biosciences) for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The BM was separated from the ZP as described above. For immunoprecipitation, 750 μl of medium were incubated with 10 μl anti-ggBM1 antiserum or preimmuneserum for 4 h at 4 °C. 25 μl of a 50% (w/v) suspension of protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS were added, and incubation was continued overnight. The beads were washed four times with 500 μl of PBS + 1% Triton X-100, resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for electrophoresis.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Molecular weights were estimated by use of a molecular weight marker (SDS molecular weight markers Broad Range or Precision Plus Protein Standards, Bio-Rad). The gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue (Gelcode-blue; Pierce) or with Alcian blue (21Bjornsson S. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 2000; 233: 27-35PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences) by semidry blotting. After incubation with 5% nonfat milk powder in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking solution), membranes were incubated with primary antisera against ggBM1 (1:500), perlecan 2–4 (1:500), or apolipoprotein B-100 (1:500) in blocking solution. Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma), and signals detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Immunohistochemistry—For cryosections, small yellow follicles and eyes were embedded in freezing reagent (Microm Austria) and immediately frozen. Cryostat sections of 20 μm were prepared and fixed on SuperFrostR Plus slides (Menzel-Glaöser, Braunschweig, Germany) with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 10 min. For paraffin sections, tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 8 μm were prepared and deparaffinized in XEM-200 (Vogel Co.) by gentle shaking for 20 min. The sections were rehydrated using increasing dilutions of ethanol. In both cases, the slides were blocked with 1% goat serum, 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and were then incubated with antisera against ggBM1 (1:250), ZP1 (1:5.000), perlecan 2–4 (1:250), apolipoprotein B-100 (1:250), apo-yB5 (1:250), or apoVLDLII (1:250) as indicated, for 1 h or overnight in a humid chamber. For immunofluorescence microscopy, sections were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with fluorescence-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor-488 at 1:500 dilution, Molecular Probes) for 2 h. Counterstaining of cell nuclei was performed with DAPI. Specimens were mounted in fluorescent mounting media (DAKO) and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss, LSM 510Meta).Determination of Partial Protein Sequence of ggBM1—For protein sequencing, chondroitinase ABC-digested BM (100 μg of protein) was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To obtain specific peptide fragments of ggBM1, the protein was visualized with Coomassie Blue, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), and digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) directly on the membrane according to (22Fernandez J. Andrews L. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The peptides obtained were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Hypersil C18 BDS 3-m LC-Packings column (150 × 1.0 mm) and a 130 A HPLC separation system (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) with mobile phases consisting of solvent A (water, 0.1% trifluoric acid) and solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.085% trifluoric acid). HPLC-separated fragments were sequenced on polybrene-treated filters with a Procise 494 A protein sequencer from Applied Biosystems.RESULTSAnalysis of the Extracellular Membranes of the Chicken Ovarian Follicle—Both the ZP and the BM were obtained from fragments of sheets of GC isolated from follicles in the size range of 1 to 2.5 cm diameter (the F5, F4, F3, and F2 follicles) according to Ref. 23Gilbert A.B. Evans A.J. Perry M.M. Davidson M.H. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1977; 50: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar. Following incubation in 5 mm EDTA for 30 min at 23 °C, the translucent basement membrane was retrieved with sharp forceps, and the zona pellucida together with GC debris were sedimented by centrifugation. The protein contents of the two membranes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Staining with Coomassie Blue (lanes 1 and 2) revealed that there were very few, if any, comigrating bands in the two preparations, indicating their complete separation. The ZP (lane 1) showed the typical protein components characterized previously (24Waclawek M. Foisner R. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the BM (lane 2), a diffuse band at 135 kDa was the predominant component. Bands in the range of 200 and 165 kDa, and of approximately 68 and 84 kDa, respectively, which are further described below, varied in intensity in different BM preparations. Staining of the gel with Alcian blue (lanes 3 and 4), which binds to highly negatively charged macromolecules (21Bjornsson S. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 2000; 233: 27-35PubMed Google Scholar), revealed that the only visualized component in the BM (lane 4) was the component of approximately 135 kDa, designated ggBM1 (Gallus gallus BM protein 1). In the ZP preparation, a diffuse band of ∼210 kDa, not seen with Coomassie Blue, was stained. The diffuse migration and binding of Alcian Blue of these components indicated that they were negatively charged proteoglycans. Indeed, the 210-kDa protein in the ZP preparation has been identified as an ovomucin (25Watanabe K. Shimoyamada M. Onizuka T. Akiyama H. Niwa M. Ido T. Tsuge Y. DNA Seq. 2004; 15: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 4A. Ducret, R. Aebersold, D. L. Barber, and W. J. Schneider, unpublished data. To test for the presence of covalently attached carbohydrates in the 135-kDa ggBM1, we treated aliquots of isolated BM with a set of glycosidases specific for polyanionic polysaccharides. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris, which liberates side chains from chondroitin sulfates A and C, and digests hyaluronan side chains, led to disappearance of the diffuse 135-kDa band, and generated a narrow band with an apparent size of approximately 95 kDa (compare lanes 3 and 4). The same result was obtained by treatment with hyaluronidase from bovine testis, which cleaves β-N-acetylhexosaminine glycosidic bonds in hyaluronic acid, chondroitin, and chondroitin sulfates (lane 5). Heparinase I (lane 1) and III (lane 2) had no discernible effect on ggBM1. Thus, ggBM could carry either chondroitin sulfate or hyaluronic acid. To distinguish between these possibilities, BM was treated with hyaluronidase from S. hyalurolyticus, which recognizes and degrades only hyaluronic acids (lane 6). As this enzyme had no effect on ggBM1, at least under our conditions, the data strongly suggest that ggBM1 is a chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycan. The proteins at 200, 165, 84 (prominent in the samples in lanes 3–6), and 68 kDa (cf. Fig. 1) remained unaffected by the various enzyme treatments. Due to the close relationship between quail (C. coturnix) and chicken, both species are members of the phasianidae family, we were interested in a comparison of their BM components. Fig. 2B shows the similarity between the major ZP protein ZP1 (Ref. 19Bausek N. Waclawek M. Schneider W.J. Wohlrab F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28866-28872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar; lanes 1 and 2) and the BM proteins (lanes 3 and 4) from the two avian species. Despite considerable technical difficulty in isolating the BM from the smaller quail follicles, it can be seen that the diffuse band is only slightly larger than ggBM1, and the abovementioned bands at 200 and 165 kDa (lane 3) are present. Western blotting of BMs from chicken and quail follicles with anti-ggBM1 antibody revealed crossreactivity with the quail protein (Fig. 2C). Thus, the composition of the follicular BM of the quail, and particularly the component corresponding to ggBM1, is likely equivalent to that of the chicken.FIGURE 2Enzymatic treatment of the follicular basement membrane and comparison of follicular membranes of chicken and quail. A, follicular BM was isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Aliquots were treated with heparinase I (lane 1), heparinase III (lane 2), chondroitinase ABC (lane 4), hyaluronidase from bovine testis (lane 5), and hyaluronidase from S. hyalurolyticus (lane 6); lane 3 contained untreated extract. The samples (10 μg/lane) were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Molecular weight markers are indicated. B, ZP (lanes 1 and 2) and BM (lanes 3 and 4) of chicken (lanes 1 and 3) and quail (lanes 2 and 4) follicles were isolated and dissolved as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots (10 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Molecular weight markers are indicated. C, aliquots (10 μg of protein/lane) of BM from chicken (lane 1) and quail (lane 2) follicles were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and Western blotting with anti-ggBM1 antiserum as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Molecular weight markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of ggBM1—Next, to investigate the molecular nature of ggBM1, we obtained protein sequence data. To this end, we digested BM with chondroitinase ABC and analyzed the 95-kDa ggBM1 protein after transfer to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Since the amino terminus was blocked, tryptic fragments were subjected to conventional sequencing, resulting in four clearly collagen-derived peptides containing the characteristic Gly-Pro-Pro (GPP) repeats, K/RGPPhG/APPhGPPhGPPhG, K/RGPPhGPPhGPPhGPPhGEE, K/RGPPhGIPhGHPhGPPhGAPhGLL, and K/RGPPhGIPhGAPhGPPhGAPhGLL, where K/R are the hypothetical aminoterminal residues, and Ph denotes chemically identified hydroxyproline residues. We did not find non-collagenous sequences, even using digestions of ggBM1 with different proteases. Thus, based on the enormous number of highly homologous sequences in the large population of collagen genes, the design of specific oligonucleotides toward molecular characterization of the cDNA specifying ggBM1 was judged impossible. We also were unsuccessful to obtain clearly identifiable clones by screening a follicle expression library with affinity-purified anti-ggBM1 IgG. However, extensive multispecies BLAST searches as well as analysis of the chicken genome data base (version 38.1n) indicated that the ggBM1 band contains polypeptide(s) similar or identical to chicken type IX (preferentially its α2 chain) and/or type II collagens.To gain further insight into the nature and localization of ggBM1, we raised a rabbit antiserum against untreated ggBM1 as antigen. Fig. 3 shows that anti-ggBM1 indeed recognizes ggBM1 in BM extracts with high specificity, but not in ZP (A, lanes 1 and 2), and also reacts with ggBM1 following enzymatic removal of the chondroitin sulfate chains (lanes 3 and 4 and cf. Fig. 2). In the enzyme-treated samples, not only the 95-kDa band, but also bands at approximately 84 (lanes 3 and 4) and 68 kDa (lane 4) showed immunoreactivity. Previously, purified [14C]glycine-labeled type IX collagen from chicken embryo sternal cartilage has been reported to show a diffuse chondroitinase ABC-sensitive larger band, as well as 84 and 68 kDa apparently non-glycated polypeptides under reducing conditions (26Bruckner P. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B demonstrates that ggBM1 is completely degraded by incubation of BM extracts with collagenase, which also obliterates the 200- and 165-kDa bands, strongly supporting the notion of ggBM1 being a chondroitin-sulfated collagen.FIGURE 3Analysis of enzymatic treatment of follicular membranes. A, ZP (lane 1) and BM (lanes 2–4) were isolated, and aliquots of BM were digested with chondroitinase ABC (lane 3), hyaluronidase from bovine testis (lane 4), or incubated in buffer alone (lane 2) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples (10 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and subsequent Western blot analysis using anti-ggBM1 antiserum (1:500 dilution). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used at 1:50,000 dilution. Molecular weight markers are indicated. B, aliquots of the BM were incubated in buffer alone (lane 1) or in buffer containing collagenase IV (lane 2). Samples (10 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Molecular weight markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
