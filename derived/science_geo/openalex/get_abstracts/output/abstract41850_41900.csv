https://openalex.org/W1970516412,"The presence of macrophages is required for the regeneration of many cell types during wound healing. Macrophages have been reported to express a wide range of mitogenic factors and cytokines, but none of these factors has been shown in vivo to sustain all the wound-healing processes. It has been suggested that transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) may mediate angiogenesis, epidermal regrowth, and formation of granulation tissue in vivo. Macrophages isolated from a wound site, and not exposed to cell culture conditions, expressed messenger RNA transcripts for TGF-alpha, TGF-beta, platelet-derived growth factor A-chain, and insulin-like growth factor-1. The expression of these transcripts was determined by a novel method for RNA analysis in which low numbers of mouse macrophages were isolated from wound cylinders, their RNA was purified and reverse-transcribed, and the complementary DNA was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction primed with growth factor sequence-specific primers. This single-cell RNA phenotyping procedure is rapid and has the potential for quantification, and mRNA transcripts from a single cell or a few cells can be unambiguously demonstrated, with the simultaneous analysis of several mRNA species. Macrophages from wounds expressed TGF-alpha antigen, and wound fluids contained TGF-alpha. Elicited macrophages in culture also expressed TGF-alpha transcripts and polypeptide in a time-dependent manner after stimulation with modified low-density lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, which are characteristic of the activators found in injured tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2018972324,"Macrophage activation--enhanced capacity to kill, in a cell that otherwise mostly scavenges--is essential for host survival from infection and contributes to containment of tumours. Both microbes and tumour cells, therefore, may be under pressure to inhibit or reverse the activation of macrophages. This reasoning led to the demonstration of macrophage deactivating factors from both microbes and tumour cells. In some circumstances the host itself probably requires the ability to deactivate macrophages. Macrophages are essential to the healing of wounds and repair of tissues damaged by inflammation. Yet the cytotoxic products of the activated macrophages can damage endothelium, fibroblasts, smooth muscle and parenchymal cells (reviewed in ref. 6). Thus, after an inflammatory site has been sterilized, the impact of macrophage activation on the host might shift from benefit to detriment. These concepts led us to search for macrophage deactivating effects among polypeptide growth factors that regulate angiogenesis, fibrogenesis and other aspects of tissue repair. Among 11 such factors, two proteins that are 71% similar proved to be potent macrophage deactivators: these are transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and TGF-beta 2."

We used polyclonal antibodies against dystrophin to immunohistochemically localize the protein in human muscle. In normal individuals and in patients with myopathies other than DMD, dystrophin was localized to the sarcolemma of the fibers. The protein was absent or markedly deficient in DMD. The sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin is consistent with other evidence that there are structural and functional abnormalities of muscle surface membranes in DMD."
https://openalex.org/W1967776309,"The time of replication of centromeres and telomeres of the yeast S. cerevisiae was determined by performing Meselson-Stahl experiments with synchronized cells. The nine centromeres examined become hybrid in density early in S phase, eliminating the possibility that a delay in the replication of centromeres until mitosis is responsible for sister chromatid adherence and proper chromosome segregation at anaphase. The conserved sequence element Y', present at most telomeres, replicates late in S phase, as do the unique sequences adjacent to five specific telomeres. The early and late replication times of these structural elements may be either essential for their proper function or a consequence of some architectural feature of the chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1562645464,"We have used cDNA probes for two small vitamin K-dependent bone matrix proteins, bone Gla protein (BGP) and matrix Gla protein (MGP), to evaluate the possibility that either of these proteins might be synthesized by the various soft tissues previously shown to have gamma-carboxylase activity. BGP mRNA was found in bone but not in any of the soft tissues tested, a result which reinforces the view that plasma BGP is a specific marker for bone metabolism. In contrast, MGP mRNA was found in all rat tissues examined. Lung and heart have 10-fold higher levels of MGP mRNA than bone, and kidney has a 5-fold higher level. Despite the high levels of MGP mRNA in heart and kidney, these tissues contain 40-500-fold lower concentrations of MGP protein than bone. Immunofluorescence was used to identify cells that contain MGP in kidney, lung, heart, and spleen. In each tissue, MGP was found in discrete tissue-specific cell types. In most of the soft tissues tested, MGP is the first well characterized substrate for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase found to be synthesized. The exceptionally broad tissue distribution for MGP synthesis demonstrates that the function of MGP is not specific to connective tissues, and the low levels of MGP antigen in soft tissues with high MGP mRNA levels indicate that MGP is unlikely to act solely by virtue of its accumulation in an extracellular matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1536335250,"Kinetic studies performed on p21H guanine nucleotide complexes with and without Mg2+ show that point mutations at positions 12, 59, and 61 each have a different effect on the rate of nucleotide dissociation. Double mutants with a combination of these amino acid substitutions reveal that the effects of each mutation on these kinetics are interactive (nonadditive) for positions 12 and 59 and approximately additive for the positions 12 and 61. The magnitude and direction of the effects seen are dependent on the nature of the nucleotide and whether or not the complexes contain Mg2+. All the mutants have reduced GTPase activity. It is also shown that the autophosphorylation reaction velocity is of first order with respect to the protein concentration and that this reaction is an intramolecular one, which takes place as a side reaction of the GTPase reaction. The autophosphorylation is not reversible under the experimental conditions. The covalently bound phosphate does not decrease the nucleotide-binding ability of the protein nor does it change the relative affinity of the protein for GTP versus GDP. The results are discussed in terms of the structural model and function of p21H."
https://openalex.org/W1582613670,"The enzymatic activity of the protease subtilisin in anhydrous organic solvents can be dramatically increased by pretreating the before it is placed in the nonaqueous medium. For instance, lyophilization of subtilisin from aqueous solution containing competitive inhibitors (followed by their removal) created an which was up to 100 times more active than the lyophilized in the absence of such ligands. This phenomenon of ligand-induced enzyme memory also extends to the stability, affinity, and substrate specificity of subtilisin in organic solvents."

https://openalex.org/W126794640,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae with mutations at the sec7 locus are pleiotropically deficient in protein transport within the Golgi apparatus and proliferate a large array of Golgi cisternae at a restrictive growth temperature (37 degrees C). The SEC7 gene and its product (Sec7p) have been evaluated by molecular cloning and sequence analysis. Two genes that allow sec7 mutant cells to grow at 37 degrees C are represented in wild-type yeast DNA libraries. A single copy of the authentic SEC7 gene permits growth of mutant cells, whereas the other gene suppresses growth deficiency only when expressed from a multicopy plasmid. The SEC7 gene is contained on a 8.4-kilobase pair SphI restriction fragment, portions of which hybridize to a single 6-kilobase pair mRNA. The gene is essential for yeast vegetative growth. DNA sequence analysis of this region detects a single open reading frame with the potential to encode a 2008-amino acid-long hydrophilic protein of 230 kDa. Putative Sec7p contains an unusual, highly charged acidic domain of 125 amino acids with 29% glutamate, 18% aspartate, and 21% serine. Within this region, stretches of 14 consecutive glutamate residues and 13 consecutive glutamates/aspartates are predicted. This domain in Sec7p may serve a structural role to interact with lipids or proteins on the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1583351416,"In a preceding paper (Briza, P., Winkler, G., Kalchhauser, H., and Breitenbach, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4288-4294), we reported the presence of dityrosine in the outer layers of yeast ascospore walls. Both outer layers seen in electron micrographs of yeast ascospore walls are sporulation-specific. Here we show that the second of these two outer layers consists of chitosan. In intact spores, it is shielded from staining with primulin by the outermost layer. However, in purified spore walls, the second layer is brightly stained by primulin, and hydrolysates of such preparations contain about 10% glucosamine relative to spore wall dry weight. The spore wall material staining with primulin is resistant to chitinase, but readily degraded by treatment with HNO2. Acetylation prior to HNO2 treatment completely prevents its degradation. A partial acid hydrolysate of spore walls contains predominantly soluble poly-beta-(1,4)-glucosamine as determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy. By these criteria, the glucosamine polymer of yeast ascospore walls is chitosan. As spore walls treated with alkali lack the inner layers but contain chitosan and as chitosan is not exposed at the surface of the spore, we conclude that it is localized in the second outer layer of the spore wall."
https://openalex.org/W1588542502,"Mutations affecting the secB gene of Escherichia coli cause a defect in protein export. This report presents the demonstration that the secB mutations caused a defect in co-translational processing of maltose binding protein (MBP). A significant amount of post-translational processing of pre-MBP occurred within 1 min after termination of pulse labeling; at later time points only a small amount of additional processing occurred. The conformation of the intracellular precursor form of MBP was examined in a secB::Tn5 mutant, using protease sensitivity (Randall, L. L., and Hardy, S. J. S. (1986) Cell 46, 921-928) as the assay. In contrast to the isogenic wild type strain, a population of pre-MBP that had folded into a protease resistant conformation was detected in the secB mutant. In addition, sublethal doses of chloramphenicol did not significantly affect protein export in the secB::Tn5 mutant and the secB::Tn5 mutation did not lead to defects in membrane energization."

https://openalex.org/W1598208909,"Phagocytic cells can be primed for enhanced stimulated release of superoxide anion (O2-) by exposure to a variety of biologic agents, including gamma-interferon and lipopolysaccharide. We examined the role of calcium ion in this priming, using the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Preincubation with ionomycin, 1 to 10 nM, primed human neutrophils to release up to 7-fold more O2- during stimulation with 1 microM formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (f-Met-Leu-Phe). With 160 nM phorbol myristate acetate as stimulus, ionomycin caused a doubling of O2- production in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Incubation of phagocytes with ionomycin at priming concentrations did not directly stimulate O2- release. Priming of neutrophils occurred in 1-2 min and was associated with a marked reduction in the lag time for O2- release after f-Met-Leu-Phe stimulation and with an increase in the rate of O2- production. Kinetic analysis of NADPH-dependent O2(-)-producing activity in sonicates of resting human neutrophils incubated with sodium dodecyl sulfate suggested that modification of the enzyme responsible for the respiratory burst was not responsible for priming. Priming of neutrophils with ionomycin had no apparent effect on either the activity or subcellular distribution of protein kinase C. The effect of ionomycin on the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c) was assessed in neutrophils using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2. Ionomycin at priming concentrations caused an approximate doubling of the base-line [Ca2+]c. When neutrophils were exposed to various concentrations of ionomycin, a parallel rise in [Ca2+]c and priming was observed. A rise in [Ca2+]c of approximately 0.8 microM caused half-maximal priming. These results suggest that an increase in [Ca2+]c is not sufficient to initiate release of O2-, but they support the concept that Ca2+ can serve as a second messenger in this event."
https://openalex.org/W1991806242,"A new pathway of vesicle traffic between organelles has been identified. The vacuoles (lysosomes) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae zygotes rapidly exchange their contents at a specific point in the cell cycle. With the use of fluorescence microscopy, ""tracks"" were observed that connect the original parental vacuoles to the newly forming bud vacuoles. These observations suggest that vacuole-derived vesicles rapidly move along the tracks in both directions, equilibrating vacuole contents. This rapid vesicle movement may be responsible for vacuole formation in newly developing cells."

The deduced translation product codes for a polypeptide of 1178 amino acids, having a calculated molecular weight of 130,100. The protein shows strong sequence homology to specific regions of other biotin carboxylases, lipoamide transferases, and carbamyl phosphate synthetases. The homologous regions suggest the presence of three subsites in the enzyme: a biotin attachment site, a keto acid-binding site, and an ATP-binding site. Partial proteolysis with a variety of proteases under nondenaturing conditions indicates the presence of structural domains corresponding to these subsites."
https://openalex.org/W1481171708,"Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase of Escherichia coli is one of a small group of pyruvoyl-dependent enzymes (Satre, M., and Kennedy, E.P. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 479-483). The DNA sequence of the structural gene (psd) and partial protein sequence studies demonstrate that the enzyme contains two nonidentical subunits, alpha (Mr = 7,332) and beta (Mr = 28,579), which are derived from a single proenzyme. These two subunits are blocked at their respective amino termini. Reduction of the enzyme with NaCNBH3 in the presence of radiolabeled phosphatidylserine resulted in association of the label with the alpha subunit. Similar reduction in the presence of ammonium ions exposed a new amino terminus for the alpha subunit beginning with alanine. Therefore, the pyruvate prosthetic group is in amide linkage to the amino terminus of the alpha subunit. The amino terminus of the beta subunit was determined to be formylmethionine. The carboxyl terminus of the beta subunit was determined to be glycine as predicted by the DNA sequence. Comparison of the DNA sequence and protein sequence information revealed that the decarboxylase is made as a proenzyme (Mr = 35,893), and the predicted amino acid at the position of the pyruvate within the open reading frame of the proenzyme is serine. Therefore, as with other pyruvoyl-dependent decarboxylases, the prosthetic group is derived from serine through a post-translational cleavage of a proenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1482091961,"Ferrochelatase was purified to homogeneity from yeast mitochondrial membranes and found to be a 40-kDa polypeptide with a pI at 6.3. Fatty acids were absolutely necessary to measure the activity in vitro. The Michaelis constants for protoporphyrin IX (9 x 10(-8) M), ferrous iron (1.6 x 10(-7) M), and zinc (9 x 10(-6) M) were determined on purified enzyme preparations in the presence of dithiothreitol. However, the Km for zinc was lower when measured in the absence of dithiothreitol (K-m(Zn2+) = 2.5 x 10(-7) M, Km(protoporphyrin) unchanged). The maximum velocities of the enzyme were 35,000 nmol of heme/h/mg of protein and 27,000 nmol of zinc-protoporphyrin/h/mg of protein. Antibodies against yeast ferrochelatase were raised in rabbits and used in studies on the biogenesis of the enzyme. Ferrochelatase is synthesized as a higher molecular weight precursor (Mr = 44,000) that is very rapidly matured in vivo to the Mr = 40,000 membrane-bound form. This precursor form of ferrochelatase was immunoprecipitated from in vitro translation (in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system) of total yeast RNAs. The antibodies were used to characterize two yeast mutant strains deficient in ferrochelatase activity as being devoid of immunodetectable protein in vivo and ferrochelatase mRNA in vitro translation product. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein has been established and was found to be frayed."
https://openalex.org/W1527097784,"Infective- and vertebrate-stage trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi resist serum killing by the alternative complement pathway, whereas noninfective vector-stage epimastigotes, from which trypomastigotes derive, are serum-sensitive. This form of developmental preadaption is commonly observed in protozoan parasites, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. We have demonstrated previously that trypomastigotes spontaneously shed molecules which interfere with formation and accelerate the intrinsic decay of complement C3 convertases, a finding which may explain the evasion of complement lysis by trypomastigotes. We now describe the partial purification and characterization of the T. cruzi C3 convertase inhibitor from the supernatant of culture metacyclic and tissue culture trypomastigotes. Decay-accelerating activity for both classical and alternative pathway C3 convertases copurifies on anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography and chromatofocusing with 35S-labeled molecules of 87-93 kDa, pI 5.6-5.8. The labeled components are destroyed by papain and retained on concanavalin A-Sepharose, procedures which remove functional decay-accelerating activity from the supernatant. The 87-93-kDa components are immunoprecipitated by sera from patients chronically infected with T. cruzi, but not by antisera to any known regulatory proteins of the human complement cascade. Lytic activity for tissue culture trypomastigotes in chagasic sera is associated with antibody reactivity against the 87-93-kDa 35S-labeled components and with inhibition of decay-accelerating activity. The T. cruzi factor is the first developmentally regulated microbial complement inhibitor to be biochemically characterized."

We previously developed an electrophoresis assay that allows detection of terminus activity on any DNA fragment cloned in the pUC vector. For precise identification of terR, we tested Alu216, its subfragments, and synthetic oligonucleotides by this assay. We found terR to be composed of a pair of separable sites, terR1 and terR2, each of which can block the DNA replication fork traveling in a specific but not the opposite direction. Both terR sites were composed of 22 nucleotides containing the repeated 20 bp sequence 5'-TAGTTACAACAC(A or T) CAA(G or T) AGA-3', located 73 bp apart in the inverted position of Alu216. A DNA homology search suggested that the R6K plasmid and the E. coli chromosome share a common termination system."
https://openalex.org/W1582518444,"We have determined that 3 mol of ATP or other adenine nucleotide can bind to Escherichia coli transcription termination protein rho, in the presence or absence of the RNA cofactor that is required for activation of rho's ATPase activity. Isotope trap experiments show that the three molecules of ATP bound/rho hexamer in the absence of RNA are hydrolyzed upon addition of RNA and are therefore correctly and productively bound at active sites. These results imply that rho acts as a trimer of dimers and that either the ATPase active sites are at the interface between head-to-head protein monomers, or that ATP binding induces asymmetry among rho subunits and results in the formation of functional dimers within the hexamer. We show that ATP is efficiently hydrolyzed by rho only upon RNA binding. We have measured KD values for ATP, ADP, and Pi binding to rho and have constructed a minimal kinetic mechanism for ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1548164869,"Platelet function is inhibited by prostaglandin E1, prostaglandin I2, or forskolin, agents that increase the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP. The inhibition appears to result from cyclic AMP-stimulated phosphorylation of specific intracellular proteins. One of the major increases in phosphorylation occurs in a polypeptide of Mr = 24,000 (P24). In this study, an effort was made to identify P24. Platelets prelabeled with [32P]phosphate were incubated with prostaglandin E1, prostaglandin I2, or forskolin. Proteins that became phosphorylated were detected by autoradiography of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Several lines of evidence indicated that P24 was the beta-subunit of the plasma membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib, a glycoprotein that is essential for the adhesion of platelets to damaged subendothelium, for the rapid response of platelets to thrombin, and for the attachment of the membrane skeleton to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. P24 co-migrated with GP Ib beta on reduced gels (Mr = 24,000) and also on nonreduced gels (when GP Ib beta is disulfide-linked to GP Ib alpha and migrates with Mr = 170,000). Like GP Ib beta, P24 was associated with actin filaments in Triton X-100 lysates. Like GP Ib beta, it was selectively associated with filaments of the membrane skeleton and was released from filaments when the Ca2+-dependent protease was active. Antibodies against GP Ib immunoprecipitated P24 from platelet lysates. Finally, exposure of Bernard-Soulier platelets (which lack GP Ib) to prostaglandin E1 resulted in phosphorylation of other polypeptides, but not of P24. These studies show that P24, one of the major polypeptides phosphorylated when platelets are exposed to agents that inhibit platelet function by increasing the concentration of cyclic AMP, is the beta-subunit of GP Ib."

Incorporation of sialic acid into the oligosaccharide chains of G protein was used to monitor transport into the trans Golgi compartment. Transport-coupled sialylation required cytosol, ATP, an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor extractable from Golgi membranes, and long chain acyl coenzyme A. The G protein receiving sialic acid in the cell-free system begins its in vitro transport bearing galactose residues acquired in vivo. Earlier reports (Balch, W. E., Dunphy, W. G., Braell, W. A., and Rothman, J. E. (1984a) Cell 39, 405-416) documented that transport of G protein into the medial (GlcNAc Transferase-containing) compartment is reconstituted under the same conditions. On the basis of the results reported here, it now appears that a more complete set of transport operations of the Golgi stack may be simultaneously reconstituted."
https://openalex.org/W1606158156,"The inactivation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) by diphtheria toxin requires the presence of a post-translationally modified histidine residue in EF-2. This residue, diphthamide, has the structure 2-[3-carboxyamido-3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]histidine. The present work was undertaken to study the pathway of diphthamide biosynthesis using diphtheria toxin-resistant yeast mutants (Chen. J.-Y., Bodley, J. W., and Livingston, D. M. (1985) Mol. Cell. Biol. 5, 3357-3360) which are defective in diphthamide formation. We demonstrate here that one of these mutants (dph5) contains a toxin-resistant form of EF-2 which can be converted in vitro to a toxin-sensitive form through the action of an enzyme present in other yeast strains. Both this toxin-resistant EF-2 and its modifying enzyme have been partially purified and evidence is presented that the modifying enzyme is a specific S-adenosylmethionine:EF-2 methyltransferase. In vitro complementation to diphtheria toxin sensitivity required S-adenosylmethionine, and when partially purified components were incubated with [methyl-3H]S-adenosylmethionine, label was incorporated specifically into EF-2. Hydrolysis of labeled EF-2 yielded diphthine (the unamidated form of diphthamide) and a single chromatographically separable labeling intermediate. We conclude that the S-adenosylmethionine:EF-2 methyltransferase adds at least the last two of the three methyl groups present in diphthine and that this modification is sufficient to create diphtheria toxin sensitivity. Evidence is also presented for the existence of an ATP-dependent amidating enzyme which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of diphthamide in EF-2."
https://openalex.org/W129435480,"Ketopantoic acid reductase (EC 1.1.1.169), an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of D-(-)-pantoic acid from ketopantoic acid, was purified 6,000-fold to apparent homogeneity with a 35% overall recovery from Pseudomonas maltophilia 845 and then crystallized. The relative molecular mass of the native enzyme, as estimated by the sedimentation equilibrium method, is 87,000 +/- 5,000, and the subunit molecular mass is 30,500. The enzyme shows high specificity for ketopantoic acid as a substrate (Km = 400 microM, Vm = 1,310 units/mg of protein) and NADPH as a coenzyme (Km = 31.8 microM). Only 2-keto-3-hydroxyisovalerate (Km = 8.55 mM, Vm = 35.8 units/mg) was reduced among a variety of other carbonyl compounds tested. The reaction is reversible (Km for D-(-)-pantoic acid = 52.1 mM), although the reaction equilibrium greatly favors the direction of D-(-)-pantoic acid formation. That the enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of D-(-)-pantoic acid necessary for the biosynthesis of pantothenic acid in P. maltophilia 845 is indicated by the observations that only this enzyme is missing in D-(-)-pantoate (or pantothenate)-requiring mutants derived from P. maltophilia 845 among several enzymes (i.e. ketopantoyl lactone reductase (EC 1.1.1.168) and acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (EC 1.1.1.86], which may be concerned in the formation of D-(-)-pantoic acid, assayed, whereas it is present in substantial amounts in the parent strain and in spontaneous revertants of the mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1507514673,"Oxymyoglobin (MbO2) is oxidized easily to metmyoglobin (metMb) with generation of the superoxide anion, which can be converted by the spontaneous dismutation into H2O2, this being also a potent oxidant of MbO2. In the presence of sodium azide in stoichiometric amounts, however, the rate of autoxidation of MbO2 increased rapidly with increasing concentration of the anion, but soon reached a saturating level, the extent of which was about twice that of the normal autoxidation in buffer alone. Quantitative analysis has revealed that this enhancement is not due to the nucleophilic displacement of O2- from MbO2 by the anion (Satoh, Y., and Shikama, K. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10272-10275), but is due to the additional oxidation of MbO2 by H2O2 freed from the metMb being occupied by the anion at the sixth coordination position. Based on these novel results and stoichiometric considerations, it is possible to propose a new view that H2O2 produced from O2- can be eliminated or decomposed mostly, if not completely, by the metMb resulting from the normal autoxidation reaction of MbO2, presumably via the formation of the ferryl species."
https://openalex.org/W1526200915,"DNA encoding an antigen of 101,000 apparent molecular weight from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum was cloned and sequenced. Genomic DNA from the Camp strain covering the complete coding region along with cDNA from the FCR3 strain covering 81% of the coding region were obtained. The cloned DNA specified a full-length protein of 743 amino acids which included two tandemly repeated regions, one near the amino terminus containing eight hexapeptide repeats of sequence TVNDEDED, and the second near the carboxyl terminus containing primarily KE and KEE repeats. The latter repeated region is encoded by a 174-base stretch of mRNA containing only a single pyrimidine. Except for a putative leader sequence located at the amino terminus of the protein, the protein is hydrophilic and highly charged with a calculated isoelectric point of 5.6. Sequences from the Camp and FCR3 strains are very close and are also nearly identical to the partial cDNA sequence of the acidic basic repeated antigen (ABRA) protein from the FC27 strain (Stahl, H.D., Bianco, A.E., Crewther, R.F., Anders, R.F., Kyne, A.P., Coppel, R. L., Mitchell, G.F., Kemp, D.J., and Brown, G.V. (1986) Mol. Biol. Med. 3, 351-368). ABRA was previously shown to be located at the merozoite surface and in the parasitophorous vacuole. Because of its location and because it becomes complexed to merozoites when schizonts rupture in the presence of immune serum, ABRA is a candidate component of a malaria vaccine."

The enzyme hydrolyzed, with decreasing rates, phenylazobenzyloxy-carbonyl-L-Pro-L-Leu Gly-L-Pro-D-Arg (PZ-PLGPA), furylacrylolyl-L-Leu-Gly-L-Pro-L-Ala, and furylacryloyl-L-Phe-Gly-Gly, while furylacryloyl-Gly-L-Leu-NH2 was not hydrolyzed. The enzyme degraded soluble and insoluble collagens, Azocoll and gelatin. Bradykinin was hydrolyzed at a high rate at the Phe-Ser bond. The enzyme was sensitive to pyrophosphate, L-cysteine, and L-histidine and could be totally inactivated in the presence of metal chelators. The enzyme contains 1 mol of Zn/mol and the hydrolysis of PZ-PLGPA is slightly increased by Ca2+. The enzyme is readily inhibited by heavy metal cations, but Cu2+ and Ni2+ affected the catalysis in opposite ways: increasing levels of Cu2+ decreased the affinity of the enzyme for PZ-PLGPA, whereas Ni2+ had no effect. The effect of Cu2+ also depended on the pH and type of buffer used. Detailed chemical modification experiments suggested that the active site of the enzyme contains at least 1 tyrosyl and 1 lysyl residue, and 1 carboxyl group. The enzyme was not sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents and thiols did not activate the enzyme. The modification studies were unable to reveal active histidyl residues. The ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze PZ-PLGPA, furylacryloyl-L-Leu-Gly-L-Pro-L-Ala, furylacryloyl-L-Phe-Gly-Gly, and various collagenous materials, its inactivity toward furylacryloyl-Gly-L-Leu-NH2, and the results from the chemical modification studies suggest that the B. cereus (Soc 67) collagenolytic enzyme can be regarded as a true collagenase which resembles the Clostridium histolyticum collagenase(s)."

N-Hydroxy DAP 4, N-amino DAP 5, and 4-methylene DAP 6 are substrates of the dehydrogenase with relative rates exceeding those of the meso isomers of the thia analogs 1ab, 2ab, and 3ab. DAP epimerase was assayed by coupling the epimerization of LL-DAP to DL-DAP (Km = 0.26 mM) with the dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation of DL-DAP by NADP. Lanthionine isomers 1ab and 1c were stronger inhibitors of the epimerase (Ki = 0.18 mM, Ki' = 0.67 mM, and Ki = 0.42 mM, respectively) than the corresponding meso-sulfoxide 2ab or the meso-sulfone 3ab. Other isomers of 2 and 3, as well as compounds 7 and 8, showed no epimerase inhibition. N-Hydroxy DAP 4 was the most potent competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.0056 mM) of the epimerase, whereas N-amino DAP 5 is weaker (Ki = 2.9 mM) and 4-methylene DAP 6 is a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki' = 0.95 mM). Although none of the analogs tested showed time-dependent inactivation of either enzyme, compounds 4, 5, 6, and 7 display substantial antibacterial activities. Possible mechanisms of epimerase inhibition and significance of the DAP pathway as a target for antibiotics are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1596856326,"Abstract We have previously shown that cultured human proximal tubular cells (PT) incubated with gentamicin contain numerous myeloid bodies. This morphological change was accompanied by the storage of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. In order to delineate the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells incubated with gentamicin, we pursued detailed studies on the activity of sphingomyelinase. Characterization studies on sphingomyelinase revealed that this enzyme has a bimodal pH optima in PT cells. Optimum activity was observed at pH 5.6 (designated as acid sphingomyelinase, A-SMase) and at pH 7.4 (designated as neutral sphingomyelinase, N-SMase). The activity of both the enzymes increased proportionately in control cells as a function of days of incubation. The activity of A-SMase was 16% lower in cells incubated with gentamicin as compared to control. The most striking observation was a gradual decline in the activity of N-SMase in cells incubated with gentamicin. Thus, following 21 days of incubation of cells with 0.3 mM gentamicin, the N-SMase was 2.7-fold lower than control cells. Mg2+ stimulated and Triton X-100 inhibited the activity of N-SMase. Whereas Mg2+ had no effects, Triton X-100 stimulated the activity of the A-SMase in PT cells. Moreover, A-SMase was relatively more heat-resistant than the N-SMase. The Km values for sphingomyelin using A-SMase in control cells and cells incubated with gentamicin were 0.07 X and 0.016 X 10(-7) M, respectively, whereas the Km values for sphingomyelin using N-SMase in control cells and cells incubated with gentamicin were 1.8 X and 1.5 X 10(-7) M, respectively. These findings suggest that gentamicin exerts a competitive inhibition of the A-SMase in PT cells. In contrast, gentamicin exerts a noncompetitive inhibition of the N-SMase in PT cells. Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that A-SMase was exclusively localized in the lysosome-rich fraction, whereas most, if not all, the N-SMase was localized in the microsomal fraction and plasma-membrane-rich fraction in cultured PT cells. Cells incubated with gentamicin for 21 days contained 25% lower activity of A-SMase associated with the lysosomal fraction as compared to control. In contrast, N-SMase activity in the microsomal and plasma membrane fraction was one-half as compared to control. We conclude that gentamicin-mediated decrease in sphingomyelinase activity may be responsible for the storage of sphingomyelin in cultured human PT cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2066462368,"Homologous recombination usually involves the production of heteroduplex DNA, DNA containing strands contributed from two different duplexes. RecA protein of E. coli can promote the formation of heteroduplex DNA in vitro by the exchange of DNA strands between two helical structures, duplex DNA and a helical recA nucleoprotein filament containing a single strand of DNA. Complete unwinding of the parental duplex and the rewinding of one strand with a new complement requires rotation of the helical structures about one another, or about their respective longitudinal axes. The observations described here demonstrate an association of torsional stress with strand exchange, and suggest that exchange is accomplished principally by concomitant rotation of duplex DNA and the recA nucleoprotein filament, each about its longitudinal axis."

Cloning and sequencing of the ASP3 gene, and partial amino acid sequencing as asparaginase II, imply that both bands are encoded by ASP3 but have different N termini. Northern blot analysis using the cloned ASP3 gene as a probe indicates that nitrogen catabolite repression of asparaginase II is achieved by alteration in mRNA levels. Deletion of sequences greater than 600 base pairs upstream from the initiation AUG codon results in an altered response to certain nitrogen sources in strains containing the truncated gene."
https://openalex.org/W1568501481,"The mitochondrial matrix enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is synthesized on cytoplasmic polysomes as a larger precursor (pMDH) with an NH2-terminal leader peptide of 24 amino acids. Import of in vitro synthesized MDH into mitochondria results in formation of the mature-sized subunit. We report here that the conversion of pMDH to mMDH occurs via two distinct cleavage events within the leader peptide. First, pMDH is cleaved to an intermediate form (iMDH) of MDH. Conversion of the precursor to the intermediate form is catalyzed by a protease localized to the mitochondrial matrix. The cleavage of pMDH to iMDH involves the removal of 15 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of the pMDH leader peptide. The iMDH is subsequently cleaved, also by a matrix protease, to mature MDH in a reaction which is O-phenanthroline-sensitive. Cleavage to iMDH and to mature MDH occurs prior to completion of translocation of the MDH polypeptide chain into the mitochondrial matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1608693183,"Abstract The active site(s) of the bifunctional regulatory protein of pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase catalyze(s) the Pi-dependent activation (dephosphorylation) and ADP-dependent inactivation (phosphorylation) of maize leaf dikinase. The chemical modification studies of the regulatory protein active sites presented in this paper are interpreted as showing the two sites to be physically distinct. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoate (NTCB) selectively inhibit the dikinase activating site, which is protected by the nonprotein substrate, Pi. Phenylglyoxal blocks both the activation and inactivation sites; the former is protected selectively by Pi and the latter by both the nonprotein substrate, ADP, and Pi. The Pi that protects the inactivation site is distinct from the activation substrate. Inhibition studies show Pi to be a parabolic competitive inhibitor of the ADP-dependent inactivation of dikinase, implying that besides substrate Pi, a second phosphate also binds to the regulatory protein. The above chemical modifications are not mutually exclusive; neither NTCB, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), nor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate blocks subsequent modification of the activation site by phenylglyoxal. Similarly, prior modification with NTCB does not affect modification by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1523825839,"Abstract We have established two murine hybridoma cell lines that secrete monoclonal antibodies directed against the tau subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of Escherichia coli. Both antibodies have been purified and identified to be of the IgG1 class. Competition assays indicate that they bind to two distinct portions of the tau subunit. These antibodies have been used to demonstrate that tau is an integral part of all DNA polymerase III holoenzyme assemblies and that tau is the product of the dnaZX gene. Both of the antibodies react only with tau, not with gamma, the other protein product of the dnaZX gene. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that tau is contained within the same enzyme assemblies as gamma (dnaZ protein). This observation is discussed in the light of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme functioning as an asymmetric dimer, capable of coordinating leading with lagging strand replication."
https://openalex.org/W267262921,"Escherichia coli B glutathione synthetase is composed of four identical subunits; each subunit contains 4 cysteine residues (Cys-122, -195, -222, and -289). We constructed seven different mutant enzymes containing 3, 2, or no cysteine residues/subunit by replacement of cysteine codons with those of alanine in the gsh II gene using site-directed mutagenesis. Three mutant enzymes, Ala289, Ala222/289, Cys-free (Ala122/195/222/289), in which cysteine at residue 289 was replaced with alanine, were not inactivated by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB), while the other four mutants retaining Cys-289 were inactivated at the wild-type rate. From these selective inactivations of mutant enzymes by DTNB, the sulfhydryl group modified by DTNB was unambiguously identified as Cys-289. In this way, Cys-289 was found to be also a target of modification with 2-nitrothiocyanobenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide, while Cys-195 was of p-chloromercuribenzoate. These results suggest that both Cys-195 and Cys-289 were not essential for the activity of the glutathione synthetase, but chemical modification of either one of the two sulfhydryl groups resulted in complete loss of the activity. Replacement of Cys-122 to Ala-122 enhanced the reactivity of Cys-289 with sulfhydryl reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1594347825,"Incubation of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells infected with influenza virus in medium of pH 5.8-6.0 blocks transport of newly synthesized hemagglutinin and processing of the hemagglutinin oligosaccharides to a form resistant to endo H digestion. Upon restoration of the culture medium to pH 7.4, arrested hemagglutinin is processed and then appears on the cell surface, indicating that exclusively transport and not oligosaccharide processing is inhibited. Based upon kinetic data and localization of blocked hemagglutinin by immunofluorescence, the point of inhibition appears to be a discrete step in transport located in a pre-Golgi compartment. This conclusion is supported by the observation that trimerization of hemagglutinin, which is believed to occur in the endoplasmic reticulum, is also inhibited by acidic medium."
https://openalex.org/W1549477029,"The RecA protein of Escherichia coli will promote the plectonemic joining of a linear single-stranded DNA molecule with a homologous supertwisted double-stranded (ds) DNA molecule. As shown by others, this reaction is characterized by a single cycle of joint formation and dissociation, termed the D-loop cycle. The released DNA products appear by electron microscopy to be topologically identical to the reactant DNAs, yet a second cycle of joining is not observed. This implies that either the RecA protein-single-stranded DNA filament or the dsDNA must be altered during the pairing reaction such that further joint formation is inhibited. Shibata et al. (Shibata, T., DasGupta, C., Cunningham, R. P., Williams, J. K. G., Osber, L., and Radding, C. M. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7565-7572) proposed that the dsDNA was inactivated due to the binding of RecA protein following the D-loop cycle, but were unable to describe the structure of the putative RecA-protein-dsDNA complex. Here we have extended those studies to show that if fresh dsDNA is added to a reaction mixture following completion of the D-loop cycle, joint formation is stimulated, but only with the freshly added dsDNA. Following completion of the D-loop cycle, a labile RecA protein-dsDNA complex, in which the dsDNA is partially unwound can be preserved by glutaraldehyde fixation and visualized by electron microscopy. This result provides direct evidence that the block to a second cycle of joining is due to the presence of RecA protein remaining bound to the released dsDNA."

This paper reports evidence that lumichrome (7,8-dimethylalloxazine) may be present in the binding site of the receptor and mediate the binding of storage protein and receptor. A stoichiometric amount of lumichrome was shown to bind to the storage protein under conditions in which the latter bound to its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1521897022,"Synthesis of ergosterol is demonstrated in the GL7 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This sterol auxotroph has been thought to lack the ability to synthesize sterols due both to the absence of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase and to a heme deficiency eliminating cytochrome P-450 which is required in demethylation at C-14. However, when the medium sterol was 5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol, 5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol, or 24 beta-methyl-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol, sterol synthesis was found to proceed yielding 1-3 fg/cell of ergosterol (24 beta-methylcholesta-5,7,22E-trien-3 beta-ol). Ergosterol was identified by mass spectroscopy, gas and high performance liquid chromatography, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and radioactive labeling from [3H]acetate. Except for some cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol (cholesterol) which was derived from the 5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta-ol, the stanol and the two 8(14)-stenols were not significantly metabolized confirming the absence of an isomerase for migration of the double bond from C-8(14) to C-7. Drastic reduction of ergosterol synthesis to not more than 0.06 fg/cell was observed when the medium sterol either had a double bond at C-5, as in the case of cholesterol, or could be metabolized to a sterol with such a bond. Thus, both 5 alpha-cholest-8(9)-en-3 beta-ol and 5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol (lathosterol) were converted to cholesta-5,7-dien-3 beta-ol (7-dehydrocholesterol), and the presence of the latter dienol depressed the level of ergosterol. The most attractive of the possible explanations for our observations is the assumption of two genetic compartments for synthesis of sterols, one of which has and one of which has not been affected by the two mutations. The ability, despite the mutations, to synthesize small amounts of ergosterol which could act to regulate the cell cycle may also explain why this mutant can grow aerobically with cholesterol (acting in the bulk membrane role) as the sole exogenous sterol."
https://openalex.org/W234056325,"A single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) affinity column was prepared by optimizing the coupling of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein to Affi-Gel 10. The bound SSB retained its ability to specifically bind single-stranded DNA. When nuclease-treated cell extracts were incubated with the SSB beads overnight at 4 degrees C, a major protein of Mr = 25,000 was bound. At shorter incubation times, two additional proteins of Mr = 32,000 and 36,000 were also detected. In the absence of nuclease treatment, eight additional proteins ranging from Mr = 14,000 to 160,000 also bound to the affinity column. The major Mr = 25,000 protein has been shown to be a folded chromosome-associated protein. Its binding to SSB is strongly enhanced by the addition of DNA polymerase III or DNA polymerase III holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1630632172,"Abstract Insulin binding to isolated rat white adipocytes at 15 degrees C, a temperature at which cellular degradation of insulin is negligible, has been found to be described by the Two-step Binding Model: R + I in equilibrium RI in equilibrium R'I (Lipkin, E. W., Teller, D. C., and de Haen, C. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1702-1711). RI is the initially formed complex between the receptor, R, and insulin, I, and R'I is the complex in an altered state or cellular location. Here the possibility was examined that R'I results from disulfide exchange between the receptor and insulin, an exchange proposed by Clark and Harrison (Clarke, S., and Harrison, L. C. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12239-12244) to occur at 37 degrees C. A number of sulfhydryl reagents representing various chemical reactivities did not affect insulin binding. The exception was 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which enhanced the number of insulin-binding sites up to 2-fold with no effect on the equilibrium constant. The data suggested that this enhancement was due to activation of cryptic binding sites pre-existing on the cell surface, possibly by increasing the valency of the receptor from 1 to 2. Insulin binding was also enhanced by structural congeners of DTNB devoid of sulfhydryl reactivity, the simplest one being benzoic acid. It was concluded that the effects were not related to modification of sulfhydryl groups, that modification of sulfhydryl groups on the receptor either did not take place or was without effect on binding, and finally, that disulfide exchange between insulin and the receptor was an unlikely explanation for the formation of R'I. Also, since it is possible to show insulin action at 15 degrees C, contrary to the proposal by Clark and Harrison (Clark, S., and Harrison, L. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11434-11437), disulfide exchange does not appear to be necessary for signal transmission by the occupied receptor."
