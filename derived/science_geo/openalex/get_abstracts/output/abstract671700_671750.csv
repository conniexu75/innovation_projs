https://openalex.org/W3070461787,"We compute the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization (LO-HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g_\mu-2)$, using lattice QCD. Calculations are performed with four flavors of 4-stout-improved staggered quarks, at physical quark masses and at six values of the lattice spacing down to 0.064~fm. All strong isospin breaking and electromagnetic effects are accounted for to leading order. The infinite-volume limit is taken thanks to simulations performed in volumes of sizes up to 11~fm. Our result for the LO-HVP contribution to $(g_\mu-2)$ has a total uncertainty of 0.8\%. Compared to the result of the dispersive approach for this contribution, ours significantly reduces the tension between the standard model prediction for $(g_\mu-2)$ and its measurement."
https://openalex.org/W3146001933,"Cancer cells characteristically consume glucose through Warburg metabolism1, a process that forms the basis of tumour imaging by positron emission tomography (PET). Tumour-infiltrating immune cells also rely on glucose, and impaired immune cell metabolism in the tumour microenvironment (TME) contributes to immune evasion by tumour cells2-4. However, whether the metabolism of immune cells is dysregulated in the TME by cell-intrinsic programs or by competition with cancer cells for limited nutrients remains unclear. Here we used PET tracers to measure the access to and uptake of glucose and glutamine by specific cell subsets in the TME. Notably, myeloid cells had the greatest capacity to take up intratumoral glucose, followed by T cells and cancer cells, across a range of cancer models. By contrast, cancer cells showed the highest uptake of glutamine. This distinct nutrient partitioning was programmed in a cell-intrinsic manner through mTORC1 signalling and the expression of genes related to the metabolism of glucose and glutamine. Inhibiting glutamine uptake enhanced glucose uptake across tumour-resident cell types, showing that glutamine metabolism suppresses glucose uptake without glucose being a limiting factor in the TME. Thus, cell-intrinsic programs drive the preferential acquisition of glucose and glutamine by immune and cancer cells, respectively. Cell-selective partitioning of these nutrients could be exploited to develop therapies and imaging strategies to enhance or monitor the metabolic programs and activities of specific cell populations in the TME."
https://openalex.org/W3145824801,"Objective To study the U.S. public’s health behaviors, attitudes, and policy opinions about COVID-19 in the earliest weeks of the national health crisis (March 20–23, 2020). Method We designed and fielded an original representative survey of 3,000 American adults between March 20–23, 2020 to collect data on a battery of 38 health-related behaviors, government policy preferences on COVID-19 response and worries about the pandemic. We test for partisan differences COVID-19 related policy attitudes and behaviors, measured in three different ways: party affiliation, intended 2020 Presidential vote, and self-placed ideological positioning. Our multivariate approach adjusts for a wide range of individual demographic and geographic characteristics that might confound the relationship between partisanship and health behaviors, attitudes, and preferences. Results We find that partisanship—measured as party identification, support for President Trump, or left-right ideological positioning—explains differences in Americans across a wide range of health behaviors and policy preferences. We find no consistent evidence that controlling for individual news consumption, the local policy environment, and local pandemic-related deaths erases the observed partisan differences in health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes. In further analyses, we use a LASSO regression approach to select predictors, and find that a partisanship indicator is the most commonly selected predictor across the 38 dependent variables that we study. Conclusion Our analysis of individual self-reported behavior, attitudes, and policy preferences in response to COVID-19 reveals that partisanship played a central role in shaping individual responses in the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results indicate that partisan differences in responding to a national public health emergency were entrenched from the earliest days of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3151678771,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of noncoding loci that are associated with human diseases and complex traits, each of which could reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease1. Many of the underlying causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer-gene maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W3152312420,"COVID-19 is a disease with unique characteristics that include lung thrombosis1, frequent diarrhoea2, abnormal activation of the inflammatory response3 and rapid deterioration of lung function consistent with alveolar oedema4. The pathological substrate for these findings remains unknown. Here we show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. The generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. On the basis of these observations, we performed two high-content microscopy-based screenings with more than 3,000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focused our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated cytopathicity. One of the most effective molecules was the antihelminthic drug niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductance in spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F (also known as anoctamin 6), a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase that is responsible for exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and support the repurposing of niclosamide for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3178653085,"The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) proposal1,2 lays out a blueprint for a universal quantum computer that uses mobile ions as qubits. Analogous to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which stores and processes imaging information as movable electrical charges in coupled pixels, a QCCD computer stores quantum information in the internal state of electrically charged ions that are transported between different processing zones using dynamic electric fields. The promise of the QCCD architecture is to maintain the low error rates demonstrated in small trapped-ion experiments3-5 by limiting the quantum interactions to multiple small ion crystals, then physically splitting and rearranging the constituent ions of these crystals into new crystals, where further interactions occur. This approach leverages transport timescales that are fast relative to the coherence times of the qubits, the insensitivity of the qubit states of the ion to the electric fields used for transport, and the low crosstalk afforded by spatially separated crystals. However, engineering a machine capable of executing these operations across multiple interaction zones with low error introduces many difficulties, which have slowed progress in scaling this architecture to larger qubit numbers. Here we use a cryogenic surface trap to integrate all necessary elements of the QCCD architecture-a scalable trap design, parallel interaction zones and fast ion transport-into a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer that has a system performance consistent with the low error rates achieved in the individual ion crystals. We apply this approach to realize a teleported CNOT gate using mid-circuit measurement6, negligible crosstalk error and a quantum volume7 of 26 = 64. These results demonstrate that the QCCD architecture provides a viable path towards high-performance quantum computers."
https://openalex.org/W3148425969,"The complete assembly of each human chromosome is essential for understanding human biology and evolution1,2. Here we use complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb centromeric α-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the β-defensin gene cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric α-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order α-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order α-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric α-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold compared to the unique portions of the genome, and this acceleration extends into the flanking sequence."
https://openalex.org/W3081810229,"In the 1950s, Pomeranchuk1 predicted that, counterintuitively, liquid 3He may solidify on heating. This effect arises owing to high excess nuclear spin entropy in the solid phase, where the atoms are spatially localized. Here we find that an analogous effect occurs in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene2-6. Using both local and global electronic entropy measurements, we show that near a filling of one electron per moiré unit cell, there is a marked increase in the electronic entropy to about 1kB per unit cell (kB is the Boltzmann constant). This large excess entropy is quenched by an in-plane magnetic field, pointing to its magnetic origin. A sharp drop in the compressibility as a function of the electron density, associated with a reset of the Fermi level back to the vicinity of the Dirac point, marks a clear boundary between two phases. We map this jump as a function of electron density, temperature and magnetic field. This reveals a phase diagram that is consistent with a Pomeranchuk-like temperature- and field-driven transition from a low-entropy electronic liquid to a high-entropy correlated state with nearly free magnetic moments. The correlated state features an unusual combination of seemingly contradictory properties, some associated with itinerant electrons-such as the absence of a thermodynamic gap, metallicity and a Dirac-like compressibility-and others associated with localized moments, such as a large entropy and its disappearance under a magnetic field. Moreover, the energy scales characterizing these two sets of properties are very different: whereas the compressibility jump has an onset at a temperature of about 30 kelvin, the bandwidth of magnetic excitations is about 3 kelvin or smaller. The hybrid nature of the present correlated state and the large separation of energy scales have implications for the thermodynamic and transport properties of the correlated states in twisted bilayer graphene."
https://openalex.org/W3140760072,"There is a growing focus on making clinical trials more inclusive but the design of trial eligibility criteria remains challenging1–3. Here we systematically evaluate the effect of different eligibility criteria on cancer trial populations and outcomes with real-world data using the computational framework of Trial Pathfinder. We apply Trial Pathfinder to emulate completed trials of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer using data from a nationwide database of electronic health records comprising 61,094 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Our analyses reveal that many common criteria, including exclusions based on several laboratory values, had a minimal effect on the trial hazard ratios. When we used a data-driven approach to broaden restrictive criteria, the pool of eligible patients more than doubled on average and the hazard ratio of the overall survival decreased by an average of 0.05. This suggests that many patients who were not eligible under the original trial criteria could potentially benefit from the treatments. We further support our findings through analyses of other types of cancer and patient-safety data from diverse clinical trials. Our data-driven methodology for evaluating eligibility criteria can facilitate the design of more-inclusive trials while maintaining safeguards for patient safety. Trial Pathfinder uses data from electronic health records of patients with cancer to evaluate eligibility criteria and broaden restrictive criteria, which facilitates the design of more-inclusive trials while maintaining safeguards for patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W3151782171,"One of the most important regulatory small molecules in plants is indole-3-acetic acid, also known as auxin. Its dynamic redistribution has an essential role in almost every aspect of plant life, ranging from cell shape and division to organogenesis and responses to light and gravity1,2. So far, it has not been possible to directly determine the spatial and temporal distribution of auxin at a cellular resolution. Instead it is inferred from the visualization of irreversible processes that involve the endogenous auxin-response machinery3-7; however, such a system cannot detect transient changes. Here we report a genetically encoded biosensor for the quantitative in vivo visualization of auxin distribution. The sensor is based on the Escherichia coli tryptophan repressor8, the binding pocket of which is engineered to be specific to auxin. Coupling of the auxin-binding moiety with selected fluorescent proteins enables the use of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal as a readout. Unlike previous systems, this sensor enables direct monitoring of the rapid uptake and clearance of auxin by individual cells and within cell compartments in planta. By responding to the graded spatial distribution along the root axis and its perturbation by transport inhibitors-as well as the rapid and reversible redistribution of endogenous auxin in response to changes in gravity vectors-our sensor enables real-time monitoring of auxin concentrations at a (sub)cellular resolution and their spatial and temporal changes during the lifespan of a plant."

The aims of the current study were to (1) document the breadth of COVID-19 experiences and their impacts on college students of a minority-serving academic institution in NYC; (2) explore associations between patterns of COVID-19 experiences and psychosocial functioning during the prolonged lockdown, and (3) explore sex and racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19-related experiences and mental health correlates. A total of 909 ethnically and racially diverse students completed an online survey in May 2020. Findings highlight significant impediments to multiple areas of students’ daily life during this period (i.e., home life, work life, social environment, and emotional and physical health) and a vast majority reported heightened symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. These life disruptions were significantly related to poorer mental health. Moreover, those who reported the loss of a close friend or loved one from COVID-19 (17%) experienced significantly more psychological distress than counterparts with other types of infection-related histories. Nonetheless, the majority (96%) reported at least one positive experience since the pandemic began. Our findings add to a growing understanding of COVID-19 impacts on psychological health and contribute the important perspective of the North American epicenter of the pandemic during the time frame of this investigation. We discuss how the results may inform best practices to support students’ well-being and serve as a benchmark for future studies of US student populations facing COVID-19 and its aftermath."
https://openalex.org/W3142261482,"Critical periods-brief intervals during which neural circuits can be modified by activity-are necessary for proper neural circuit assembly. Extended critical periods are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders; however, the mechanisms that ensure timely critical period closure remain poorly understood1,2. Here we define a critical period in a developing Drosophila motor circuit and identify astrocytes as essential for proper critical period termination. During the critical period, changes in activity regulate dendrite length, complexity and connectivity of motor neurons. Astrocytes invaded the neuropil just before critical period closure3, and astrocyte ablation prolonged the critical period. Finally, we used a genetic screen to identify astrocyte-motor neuron signalling pathways that close the critical period, including Neuroligin-Neurexin signalling. Reduced signalling destabilized dendritic microtubules, increased dendrite dynamicity and impaired locomotor behaviour, underscoring the importance of critical period closure. Previous work defined astroglia as regulators of plasticity at individual synapses4; we show here that astrocytes also regulate motor circuit critical period closure to ensure proper locomotor behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3144084593,"Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has been shown to play a key role in mediating inflammation and tissue damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In patients with IBD, the intestinal tight junction (TJ) barrier is compromised as characterized by an increase in intestinal permeability. MMP-9 is elevated in intestinal tissue, serum and stool of patients with IBD. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that MMP-9 causes an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability and that the MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal permeability is an important pathogenic factor contributing to the development of intestinal inflammation in IBD. However, the intracellular mechanisms that mediate the MMP-9 modulation of intestinal barrier function remain unclear.The main aim of this study was to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability using Caco-2 monolayers as an in-vitro model system.MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability was associated with activation and cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Knocking-down NF-κB p65 by siRNA transfection prevented the MMP-9 induced expression of the NF-κB target gene IL-8, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) protein expression, and subsequently prevented the increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. In addition, the effect of MMP-9 on Caco-2 intestinal epithelial TJ barrier function was not mediated by apoptosis or necrosis.Our data show that the MMP-9 induced disruption of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial TJ barrier function is regulated by NF-κB pathway activation of MLCK."
https://openalex.org/W3140162710,"Bile acids are lipid-emulsifying metabolites synthesized in hepatocytes and maintained in vivo through enterohepatic circulation between the liver and small intestine1. As detergents, bile acids can cause toxicity and inflammation in enterohepatic tissues2. Nuclear receptors maintain bile acid homeostasis in hepatocytes and enterocytes3, but it is unclear how mucosal immune cells tolerate high concentrations of bile acids in the small intestine lamina propria (siLP). CD4+ T effector (Teff) cells upregulate expression of the xenobiotic transporter MDR1 (encoded by Abcb1a) in the siLP to prevent bile acid toxicity and suppress Crohn's disease-like small bowel inflammation4. Here we identify the nuclear xenobiotic receptor CAR (encoded by Nr1i3) as a regulator of MDR1 expression in T cells that can safeguard against bile acid toxicity and inflammation in the mouse small intestine. Activation of CAR induced large-scale transcriptional reprogramming in Teff cells that infiltrated the siLP, but not the colon. CAR induced the expression of not only detoxifying enzymes and transporters in siLP Teff cells, as in hepatocytes, but also the key anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Accordingly, CAR deficiency in T cells exacerbated bile acid-driven ileitis in T cell-reconstituted Rag1-/- or Rag2-/- mice, whereas pharmacological activation of CAR suppressed it. These data suggest that CAR acts locally in T cells that infiltrate the small intestine to detoxify bile acids and resolve inflammation. Activation of this program offers an unexpected strategy to treat small bowel Crohn's disease and defines lymphocyte sub-specialization in the small intestine."
https://openalex.org/W3142284439,"Horizontal gene transfer and mutation are the two major drivers of microbial evolution that enable bacteria to adapt to fluctuating environmental stressors1. Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems use RNA-guided nucleases to direct sequence-specific destruction of the genomes of mobile genetic elements that mediate horizontal gene transfer, such as conjugative plasmids2 and bacteriophages3, thus limiting the extent to which bacteria can evolve by this mechanism. A subset of CRISPR systems also exhibit non-specific degradation of DNA4,5; however, whether and how this feature affects the host has not yet been examined. Here we show that the non-specific DNase activity of the staphylococcal type III-A CRISPR–Cas system increases mutations in the host and accelerates the generation of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These mutations require the induction of the SOS response to DNA damage and display a distinct pattern. Our results demonstrate that by differentially affecting both mechanisms that generate genetic diversity, type III-A CRISPR systems can modulate the evolution of the bacterial host. In Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, non-specific DNase activity of the type III-A CRISPR–Cas system increases the rate of mutations in the host and accelerates the evolution of resistance to antibiotics and to phage."
https://openalex.org/W3152471655,"Background Globally, studies have shown conflicting results regarding the association of blood groups with SARS CoV-2 infection. Objective To observe the association between ABO blood groups and the presentation and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Design, setting, and participants This was a prospective cohort study of patients with mild-to-moderately severe COVID-19 infections who presented in the COVID-19 unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital and were enrolled between 01 June and 25 August, 2020. Patients were followed up for at least 30 days after disease onset. We grouped participants with A-positive and A-negative blood groups into group I and participants with other blood groups into group II. Results The cohort included 438 patients; 52 patients were lost to follow-up, five died, and 381 completed the study. The prevalence of blood group A [144 (32.9%)] was significantly higher among COVID-19 patients than in the general population (p &lt; 0.001). The presenting age [mean (SD)] of group I [42.1 (14.5)] was higher than that of group II [38.8 (12.4), p = 0.014]. Sex (p = 0.23) and co-morbidity (hypertension, p = 0.34; diabetes, p = 0.13) did not differ between the patients in groups I and II. No differences were observed regarding important presenting symptoms, including fever (p = 0.72), cough (p = 0.69), and respiratory distress (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference in the median duration of symptoms in the two group (12 days), and conversion to the next level of severity was observed in 26 (20.6%) and 36 patients (13.8%) in group I and II, respectively. However, persistent positivity of RT-PCR at 14 days of initial positivity was more frequent among the patients in group I [24 (19%)] than among those in group II [29 (11.1%)]. Conclusions The prevalence of blood group A was higher among COVID-19 patients. Although ABO blood groups were not associated with the presentation or recovery period of COVID-19, patients with blood group A had delayed seroconversion."
https://openalex.org/W3143172349,"Background and aims We investigated the usefulness of combining two-dimensional shear wave elastography and the ultrasound-guided attenuation parameter for assessing the risk of progressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, defined as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score of ≥4 and a fibrosis stage of ≥2. Methods This prospective study included 202 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease who underwent two-dimensional shear wave elastography, ultrasound-guided attenuation parameter, vibration-controlled transient elastography, the controlled attenuation parameter, and liver biopsy on the same day. Patients were grouped according to liver stiffness measurement using two-dimensional shear wave elastography and the attenuation coefficient, assessed using the ultrasound-guided attenuation parameter: A, low liver stiffness measurement/low attenuation coefficient; B, low liver stiffness measurement/high attenuation coefficient; C, high liver stiffness measurement/low attenuation coefficient; and D, high liver stiffness measurement/high attenuation coefficient. Results Two-dimensional shear wave elastography and vibration-controlled transient elastography had equivalent diagnostic performance for fibrosis. The areas under the curve of the ultrasound-guided attenuation parameter for identifying steatosis grades ≥S1, ≥S2, and S3 were 0.89, 0.91, and 0.92, respectively, which were significantly better than those of the controlled attenuation parameter (P&lt;0.05). The percentages of progressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in Groups A, B, C, and D were 0.0%, 7.7%, 35.7%, and 50.0%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). The prediction model was established as logit (p) = 0.5414 × liver stiffness measurement (kPa) + 7.791 × attenuation coefficient (dB/cm/MHz)—8.401, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity values of 0.832, 80.9%, and 74.6%, respectively; there was no significant difference from the FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase score. Conclusion Combined assessment by two-dimensional shear wave elastography and the ultrasound-guided attenuation parameter is useful for risk stratification of progressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and may be convenient for evaluating the necessity of specialist referral and liver biopsy."
https://openalex.org/W3146010077,"Background and aim of the study Patients with asymptomatic, severe aortic stenosis are presumed to have a benign prognosis. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined the natural history of contemporary patients advised against aortic valve replacement due to a perceived lack of symptoms. Materials and methods We reviewed the medical records of every patient given the ICD-10-code for aortic stenosis (I35.0) at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, between Dec 1 st , 2002 and Dec 31 st , 2016. Patients who were evaluated by the heart team due to severe aortic stenosis were categorized by treatment strategy. We recorded baseline data, adverse events and survival for the patients characterized as asymptomatic and for 100 age and gender matched patients scheduled for aortic valve replacement. Results Of 2341 patients who were evaluated for aortic valve replacement due to severe aortic stenosis, 114 patients received conservative treatment due to a lack of symptoms. Asymptomatic patients had higher mortality than patients who had aortic valve replacement, log-rank p&lt;0.001 (mean follow-up time: 4.0 (SD: 2.5) years). Survival at 1, 2 and 3 years for the asymptomatic patients was 88%, 75% and 63%, compared with 92%, 83% and 78% in the matched patients scheduled for aortic valve replacement. 28 (25%) of the asymptomatic patients had aortic valve replacement during follow-up. Age, previous history of coronary artery disease and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were predictors of mortality and coronary artery disease and NT-proBNP were predictors of 3-year morbidity in asymptomatic patients. Conclusions In this retrospective study, asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who were advised against surgery had significantly higher mortality than patients who had aortic valve replacement."

https://openalex.org/W3143604394,"Metformin is the primary drug for type 2 diabetes treatment and a promising candidate for other disease treatment. It has significant deviations between individuals in therapy efficiency and pharmacokinetics, leading to the administration of an unnecessary overdose or an insufficient dose. There is a lack of data regarding the concentration-time profiles in various human tissues that limits the understanding of pharmacokinetics and hinders the development of precision therapies for individual patients. The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model developed in this study is based on humans’ known physiological parameters (blood flow, tissue volume, and others). The missing tissue-specific pharmacokinetics parameters are estimated by developing a PBPK model of metformin in mice where the concentration time series in various tissues have been measured. Some parameters are adapted from human intestine cell culture experiments. The resulting PBPK model for metformin in humans includes 21 tissues and body fluids compartments and can simulate metformin concentration in the stomach, small intestine, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle adipose, and brain depending on the body weight, dose, and administration regimen. Simulations for humans with a bodyweight of 70kg have been analyzed for doses in the range of 500-1500mg. Most tissues have a half-life (T 1/2 ) similar to plasma (3.7h) except for the liver and intestine with shorter T 1/2 and muscle, kidney, and red blood cells that have longer T 1/2 . The highest maximal concentrations (C max ) turned out to be in the intestine (absorption process) and kidney (excretion process), followed by the liver. The developed metformin PBPK model for mice does not have a compartment for red blood cells and consists of 20 compartments. The developed human model can be personalized by adapting measurable values (tissue volumes, blood flow) and measuring metformin concentration time-course in blood and urine after a single dose of metformin. The personalized model can be used as a decision support tool for precision therapy development for individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3145417772,"During episodes of acute inflammation, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are actively recruited to sites of inflammation or injury where they provide anti-microbial and wound-healing functions. One enzyme crucial for fulfilling these functions is myeloperoxidase (MPO), which generates hypochlorous acid from Cl− and hydrogen peroxide. The potential exists, however, that uncontrolled the extracellular generation of hypochlorous acid by MPO can cause bystander tissue damage and inhibit the healing response. Previous work suggests that the microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites 1H-indole and related molecules (“indoles”) are protective during intestinal inflammation, although their precise mechanism of action is unclear. In the present work, we serendipitously discovered that indoles are potent and selective inhibitors of MPO. Using both primary human PMNs and recombinant human MPO in a cell-free system, we revealed that indoles inhibit MPO at physiologic concentrations. Particularly, indoles block the chlorinating activity of MPO, a reliable marker for MPO-associated tissue damage, as measured by coulometric-coupled HPLC. Further, we observed direct interaction between indoles and MPO using the established biochemical techniques microscale thermophoresis and STD-NMR. Utilizing a murine colitis model, we demonstrate that indoles inhibit bystander tissue damage, reflected in decreased colon 3-chlorotyrosine and pro-inflammatory chemokine expression in vivo. Taken together, these results identify microbiota-derived indoles that acts as endogenous immunomodulatory compounds through their actions on MPO, suggesting a symbiotic association between the gut microbiota and host innate immune system. Such findings offer exciting new targets for future pharmacological intervention."

A significant factor associated with CVD is metabolic syndrome (MetS), and MetS prevalence differs by race/ethnicity. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence and predictors of ORCs by race/ethnicity among adults (&gt;18) with MetS. Methods This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from the 1999–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A chi-square test was performed to determine differences in ORC prevalence between non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB), and Hispanic participants with MetS. A multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors (race, sex, income, insurance, education, marital status, and smoking status) of ORC among adults with MetS. Results Of the 1,554 adults, the prevalence of ORC was 30.6% among NHWs, 51.3% in NHBs, and 54.1% in Hispanics ( p = &lt;0.001). Females were 6.27 times more likely to have an ORC compared to males (95% CI = 4.95–14.11). Compared to NHWs, NHBs were 2.1 times more likely to have an ORC (95% CI = 1.40–3.38); and Hispanics were 2.5 times more likely (95% CI = 1.39–4.77). For every 1-year unit increase in age, the odds of ORC increased by 3% (95% CI = 1.00–1.05). Conclusions Among NHANES participants with MetS, the prevalence of ORCs was significantly higher in NHBs and Hispanics, females, and older adults with MetS. Future studies, by race/ethnicity, are warranted on mortality risk of persons with MetS and ORC."
https://openalex.org/W3140138161,"There is a lack of data on factors that contribute to the implementation of hygiene measures during nosocomial outbreaks (NO) caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Therefore, we first conducted a systematic literature analysis to identify MRSA outbreak reports. The expenditure for infection control in each outbreak was then evaluated by a weighted cumulative hygiene score (WCHS). Effects of factors on this score were determined by multivariable linear regression analysis. 104 NO got included, mostly from neonatology (n = 32), surgery (n = 27), internal medicine and burn units (n = 10 each), including 4,361 patients (thereof 657 infections and 73 deaths) and 279 employees. The outbreak sources remained unknown in 10 NO and were not reported from further 61 NO. The national MRSA prevalence did not correlate with the WCHS (p = .714). There were significant WCHS differences for internal medicine (p = 0.014), burn units (p&lt;0.01), for Japanese NO (p&lt;0.01), and NO with an unknown source (p&lt;0.01). In sum, management of a NO due to MRSA does not depend on the local MRSA burden. However, differences of MRSA management among medical departments do exist. Strict adherence to the Outbreak Reports and Intervention Studies Of Nosocomial infection (ORION) statement is highly recommended for. The WCHS may also serve as a useful tool to quantify infection control effort and could therefore be used for further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3148303478,"Background The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between chronic endometritis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the endometrium of infertile patients in the implantation phase. Methods Endometrial biopsy specimens from 66 infertility patients were analyzed. The presence of chronic endometritis was investigated by immunostaining for CD138. Immunohistochemical staining for E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Slug, and Snail was performed, and the expression profiles were statistically analyzed according to the presence of chronic endometritis. When the loss of E-cadherin expression and/or the positive expression of N-cadherin was detected, the specimen was considered epithelial-mesenchymal transition-positive. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition-positive cases were also statistically analyzed according to the presence of chronic endometritis. The characteristics of the patients in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-positive and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-negative groups were compared. The association between variables, including age, body mass index, gravidity, parity, and each causative factor of infertility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition positivity was analyzed. Results The rates of the loss of E-cadherin expression, the gain of N-cadherin and epithelial-mesenchymal transition positivity were significantly higher in chronic endometritis patients. The expression of Slug, cytoplasmic Snail, and nuclear Snail was also detected at significantly higher rates in chronic endometritis patients. Chronic endometritis were related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Conclusion The epithelial-mesenchymal transition was frequently detected in the endometrium in infertile patients with chronic endometritis. Since the epithelial-mesenchymal transition is associated with chronic endometritis, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition appears to be involved in the alteration of mechanisms of implantation."
https://openalex.org/W3141965379,"Background Epidemiological studies demonstrate associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cancer incidence and mortality. The aim of this study was to measure OSA in women with breast (BC) or endometrial cancer (EC) and associations with clinico-pathological tumor variables. Methods and findings In a cross sectional study, women with BC (12 months) or EC (3 months) post-diagnosis were recruited from cancer clinics. We collected demographic, anthropometric data, cancer stage, grade, histopathology and history of cancer treatment and all subjects had in-laboratory polysomnography. Sleepiness was assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). We compared anthropometric and polysomnographic data between cancer groups (unpaired t-tests), and assessed relationships between cancer characteristics and OSA variables (Fishers exact test). There were no significant differences between average age (BC:59.6±8.7 years(n = 50); EC:60.3±7.7 years(n = 37)), or ESS score (BC:6.4±4.4; EC 6.8±4.7; mean±SD; all p&gt;0.2), however, BMI was higher in EC (BC: 29.7±7.9kgm - 2; EC: 34.2±8.0 kgm - 2; p&lt;0.05). BC had longer sleep latency (BC:31.8±32minutes; EC:19.3±17.9 minutes), less Stage 3 sleep (BC:20.0±5.2%; EC:23.6±8.2%) and more REM sleep (BC:21.1±6.9%; EC: 16.6±5.7%), all p&lt;0.05. EC had lower average awake and asleep oxygen saturation levels (BC: 95.6±1.3%; EC: 94.6±1.9% [awake]: BC: 94.8±2.1%; EC: 93.3±2.4% [asleep]; both p&lt;0.05). Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) (BC: 21.2(7.3–36.9) events/hr; EC: 15.7 (10–33.5) events/hour (median (interquartile range)) was not different p = 0.7), however, 58% and 57% of women with BC and EC respectively, had an AHI&gt;15 events/hour. In this small sample size group, no significant associations (all p&gt;0.1) were detected between OSA metrics and clinico-pathological tumor variables. Conclusion In postmenopausal women with breast or endometrial cancer there is high prevalence of OSA, with no association with specific tumor characteristics detected. Recognition of the high prevalence of OSA in women with cancer is important to recognise as it may impact on surgical risk and quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W3139736091,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) diagnosis using conventional gastrointestinal endoscopy is difficult because such malignancies cannot be distinguished from other types of submucosal tumors. Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) is based on the preferential uptake of photosensitizers by tumor tissues and its detection by fluorescence emission upon laser excitation. In this study, we investigated whether PDD using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a standard photosensitizer used worldwide, could be used for GIST diagnosis. 5-ALA is metabolized to endogenous fluorescent protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). We examined the accumulation of PpIX in GIST-T1 cells using flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining. Furthermore, we established GIST-T1 xenograft mouse models and examined PpIX accumulation in the resultant tumors. PpIX accumulated in GIST-T1 cells and was localized mainly to lysosomes. PpIX accumulation was also observed in murine xenograft tumors. Moreover, tumor and normal tissues could be distinctly identified by relative PpIX fluorescence. Thus, our results demonstrated that PDD with 5-ALA has substantial clinical potential for GIST diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3139840204,"Pelagia noctiluca is the most common jellyfish in the Western Mediterranean Sea, living in oceanic waters with a holoplanktonic lifecycle. Frequent outbreaks have been well documented in coastal areas, yet little is known about their offshore distribution. In this study we address the relationship between oceanographic structures and the distribution of P . noctiluca ephyrae along the central continental slope of the Western Mediterranean, covering a wide latitudinal gradient, during July-August 2016. The region is characterized by a rich and complex mesoscale surface circulation driven by the inflow of Atlantic Water into the Western Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar. The results revealed a high variability in the ephyrae spatial paterns related with different water masses and the resulting mesoscale hydrographic features. Their horizontal distribution showed a clear latitudinal gradient with high abundances in the south, associated with recent Atlantic Water, and low abundances or absence in the north, in coincidence with the old Atlantic Water transported by the Northern Current. Ephyrae showed diel vertical migrations of short-extent in the first 50 m, with a wide distribution above the thermocline and the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum during daytime, being more concentrated towards the surface at night. The results suggest the population connectivity of P . noctiluca between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. In that case, the abundance variability of the species in the Mediterranean could be modulated by its entrance associated with the inflow of Atlantic Water through the Strait of Gibraltar."
https://openalex.org/W3143069184,"During the first wave of the global COVID-19 pandemic the clinical utility and indications for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing were not clearly defined. The urgency to deploy serological assays required rapid evaluation of their performance characteristics. We undertook an internal validation of a CE marked lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) using serum from SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals and pre-pandemic samples. This was followed by the delivery of a same-day named patient SARS-CoV-2 serology service using LFIA on vetted referrals at central London teaching hospital with clinical interpretation of result provided to the direct care team. Assay performance, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly benefit in clinical decision-making, were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of LFIA were 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. 113 tests were performed on 108 participants during three-week pilot. 44% participants (n = 48) had detectable antibodies. Three main indications were identified for serological testing; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 e.g. pulmonary embolism (n = 5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent COVID-19 compatible illness (n = 40), and making infection control or immunosuppression management decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n = 6). We demonstrate acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of using a LFIA that detects anti-spike antibodies to deliver SARS-CoV-2 serology service in adults and children. Greatest benefit was seen where there is reasonable pre-test probability and results can be linked with clinical advice or intervention. Experience from this pilot can help inform practicalities and benefits of rapidly implementing new tests such as LFIAs into clinical service as the pandemic evolves."
https://openalex.org/W3143328229,"Commonly called the Mexican prickly poppy, Argemone mexicana is a stress-resistant member of the Papaveraceae family of plants that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries by indigenous communities in Mexico and Western parts of the United States. This plant has been exploited to treat a wide variety of ailments, with reported antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, as well as cytotoxic effects against some human cancer cell lines. Due to its various therapeutic uses and its abundance of secondary metabolites, A. mexicana has great potential as a drug discovery candidate. Herein, the germination conditions of A. mexicana are described and the cytotoxic activities of different parts (seeds, leaves, inner vs. outer roots) of the plant from methanol or hexane extracts are preliminarily characterized against cells of seven unique organisms. When comparing 1 mg of each sample normalized to background solvent alone, A. mexicana methanol outer root and leaf extracts possessed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with greatest effects against the Gram-positive bacteria tested, and less activity against the Gram-negative bacteria and fungi tested. Additionally, using the MTT colorimetric assay, the outer root methanol and seed hexane extracts displayed pronounced inhibitory effects against human colon cancer cells. Quantification of c-MYC (oncogene) and APC (tumor suppressor) mRNA levels help elucidate how the A. mexicana root methanol extract may be affecting colon cancer cells. After ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and subsequent nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the root and leaf methanol fractions, two main antibacterial compounds, chelerythrine and berberine, have been identified. The roots were found to possess both phytocompounds, while the leaf lacked chelerythrine. These data highlight the importance of plants as an invaluable pharmaceutical resource at a time when antimicrobial and anticancer drug discovery has plateaued."
https://openalex.org/W3149036111,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), an amphiphilic lipoglycan of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall, is a diagnostic target for tuberculosis. Previous work from our laboratory and others suggests that LAM is associated with host serum lipoproteins, which may in turn have implications for diagnostic assays. Our team has developed two serum assays for amphiphile detection: lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion. The lipoprotein capture assay relies on capture of the host lipoproteins, exploiting the biological association of host lipoprotein with microbial amphiphilic biomarkers to “concentrate” LAM. In contrast, the membrane insertion assay is independent of the association between pathogen amphiphiles and host lipoprotein association, and directly captures LAM based on its thermodynamic propensity for association with a supported lipid membrane, which forms the functional surface of an optical biosensor. In this manuscript, we explored the use of these assays for the detection of LAM in sera from adults whose tuberculosis status had been well-characterized using conventional microbiological tests, and endemic controls. Using the lipoprotein capture assay, LAM signal/noise ratios were &gt;1.0 in 29/35 (83%) individuals with culture-confirmed active tuberculosis, 8/13 (62%) individuals with tuberculosis symptoms, but no positive culture for M . tuberculosis , and 0/6 (0%) symptom-free endemic controls. To evaluate serum LAM levels without bias associated with potential differences in circulating host lipoprotein concentrations between individuals, we subsequently processed available samples to liberate LAM from associated host lipoprotein assemblies followed by direct detection of the pathogen biomarker using the membrane insertion approach. Using the membrane insertion assay, signal/noise for detection of serum LAM was greater than that observed using the lipoprotein capture method for culture-confirmed TB patients (6/6), yet remained negative for controls (2/2). Taken together, these results suggest that detection of serum LAM is a promising TB diagnostic approach, but that further work is required to optimize assay performance and to decipher the implications of LAM/host lipoprotein associations for diagnostic assay performance and TB pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3150888930,"The increasing demand for water, food and energy poses challenges for the world´s sustainability. Tropical palm oil is currently the major source of vegetable oil worldwide with a production that exceeds 55 million tons per year, while generating over 200 million tons of palm oil mill effluent (POME). It could potentially be used as a substrate for production of microalgal biomass though. In this study, the microalgal strain Chlamydomonas biconvexa Embrapa|LBA40, originally isolated from a sugarcane vinasse stabilization pond, was selected among 17 strains tested for growth in POME retrieved from anaerobic ponds of a palm oil industrial plant located within the Amazon rainforest region. During cultivation in POME, C . biconvexa Embrapa|LBA40 biomass productivity reached 190.60 mgDW • L -1 • d -1 using 15L airlift flat plate photobioreactors. Carbohydrates comprised the major fraction of algal biomass (31.96%), while the lipidic fraction reached up to 11.3% of dry mass. Reductions of 99% in ammonium and nitrite, as well as 98% reduction in phosphate present in POME were detected after 5 days of algal cultivation. This suggests that the aerobic pond stage, usually used in palm oil industrial plants to reduce POME inorganic load, could be substituted by high rate photobioreactors, significantly reducing the time and area requirements for wastewater treatment. In addition, the complete mitochondrial genome of C . biconvexa Embrapa|LBA40 strain was sequenced, revealing a compact mitogenome, with 15.98 kb in size, a total of 14 genes, of which 9 are protein coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the strain taxonomic status within the Chlamydomonas genus, opening up opportunities for future genetic modification and molecular breeding programs in these species."

These data suggest that spatial summation over an active haptic array generates representations of an object’s orientation, which may facilitate encoding of complex three-dimensional objects during active exploration. To judge the shape, size, and location of objects, cortical circuits must integrate information arriving from different parts of the sensor array, whether this be from different parts of the retina, the body surface, or the cochlea. Many animals, including humans, move their sensors to optimize information gathering, a process called “active sensation” (Gibson, 1962Gibson J.J. Observations on active touch.Psychol. Rev. 1962; 69: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Humans use active sensation to investigate and manipulate objects by executing various stereotyped hand motions (Lederman and Klatzky, 1987Lederman S.J. Klatzky R.L. Hand movements: a window into haptic object recognition.Cognit. Psychol. 1987; 19: 342-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Tactile input from adjacent fingers conveys multi-dimensional information about the orientation and structural relationship of the object’s surfaces to give rise to a coherent object percept. In the primate somatosensory cortex, individual neurons can encode the orientation and curvature of a stimulus (Hsiao et al., 2002Hsiao S.S. Lane J. Fitzgerald P. Representation of orientation in the somatosensory system.Behav. Brain Res. 2002; 135: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; DiCarlo and Johnson, 2000DiCarlo J.J. Johnson K.O. Spatial and temporal structure of receptive fields in primate somatosensory area 3b: effects of stimulus scanning direction and orientation.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 495-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sensing the shape of an object, however, depends on dynamic integration of tactile input (i.e., skin indentation) with proprioceptive information about hand and joint position (Hsiao, 2008Hsiao S. Central mechanisms of tactile shape perception.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). How cortical circuits extract shape information during active sensation is poorly understood. The rodent vibrissal system is a powerful model for active sensation and tactile perception, and the mouse offers genetic tools that make dissecting the cellular and circuit basis of tactile perception possible (Petersen, 2019Petersen C.C.H. Sensorimotor processing in the rodent barrel cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2019; 20: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rodents sweep their whiskers across objects to localize and identify them (Ahissar and Knutsen, 2008Ahissar E. Knutsen P.M. Object localization with whiskers.Biol.

Merzenich M.M. Functional architecture of the mystacial vibrissae.Behav. Brain Res. 1997; 84: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Judging object location and shape uses sensory circuits to integrate ex-afferent signals because of whisker contact and re-afferent signals because of self-generated whisker motion, conceptually analogous to proprioceptive input from the hand (Kleinfeld and Deschênes, 2011Kleinfeld D. Deschênes M. Neuronal basis for object location in the vibrissa scanning sensorimotor system.Neuron. 2011; 72: 455-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9117-9125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite this work, the neural basis for orientation perception during active sensation, which may contribute to shape identification, is not understood. To investigate the neural circuit basis of object orientation, we developed an active whisker-dependent orientation discrimination task for head-fixed mice, explored the behavioral and sensory basis of task performance, and measured neural activity in the barrel cortex as the mice solved the task. Object orientation discrimination required integration over vertically stacked whiskers, mice discriminated the object orientation per se, and calcium imaging revealed that neurons in the barrel cortex encoded all presented orientations of the stimulus, which required summation across whiskers. Optogenetically inactivating the barrel cortex strongly impaired performance, and even more selective optogenetic inactivation of layer 4 (L4) excitatory neurons reduced task performance. These data help define the circuits and computations that are required for discrimination of object orientation during active sensation. To probe the neural circuit basis of orientation perception, we developed a whisker-dependent task that required mice to discriminate the orientation of tactile stimuli (Figures 1A and 1B ). A stimulus bar was presented unilaterally to the mouse’s right intact whisker field in one of eight possible orientations. Mice were trained to discriminate positive orientations (GO) and negative orientations (NOGO), licking for rewarded GO stimuli but withholding licking to unrewarded NOGO stimuli (Figures 1C and S1). Mice routinely reached high levels of performance (discriminability index [d’], 2.3 ± 1.2 standard deviation [std]; Figures 1E–1H), performed a high number of trials (301 ± 89 std), and reached the performance criterion (d’ > 1.5) after roughly 1–2 weeks of training (8.3 ± 2.2 std days; Figure 1I). Mice readily discriminated orientations as small as 7° (Figures 1E–1G), although further training may reveal even finer acuity. Even well-trained mice exhibited some licking for unrewarded NOGO trials. To test whether this is an intrinsic perceptual bias toward such orientations or simply a bias toward licking, we trained a separate cohort of mice on the reverse orientation contingency. In these mice, we also observed licking for NOGO orientations, strongly implying that the bias was a product of the operant training and not an asymmetry in perception (Figure S1F). We developed a photo-interrupt touch detector to estimate the timing and number of whisker contacts made with the stimulus bar before its decision (Figures 1C, 1D, and S2). The mean latency from first touch to lick was around 400 ms (full pad, 0.44 ± 0.08 s; 2 whiskers, 0.48 ± 0.15 s; std; Figures 1D and S2I). Mice made ∼8 whisker contacts with the stimulus bar prior to licking (full pad, 8.5 ± 1.4; 2 whiskers, 7.1 ± 1.9; std; Figures S2J and S2K). We observed tight coordination between whisking, running, and licking behavior in trained mice during success trials; upon presentation of the stimulus, all trained mice decelerated (most strongly to GO stimuli), caudally adjusted their whisker set point, and reduced their whisking amplitude in a stimulus-dependent manner (Figures S3D and S3E). Naive mice showed modest, largely stimulus-independent changes in running and whisking and no licking behavior (Figures S3B and S3C). These data indicate that multiple motor systems (running, whisking, and licking) are highly coordinated as a consequence of learning and successful performance in the task, implying a closed-loop process (Ahissar and Assa, 2016Ahissar E. Assa E. Perception as a closed-loop convergence process.eLife. 2016; 5: e12830Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Saig et al., 2012Saig A. Gordon G. Assa E. Arieli A. Ahissar E. Motor-sensory confluence in tactile perception.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 14022-14032Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To probe how mice discriminate the orientation of the stimulus, we first confirmed the role of whiskers in task performance. When mice had reached the threshold and stable performance on the task, all whiskers were trimmed (∼2 mm length), preventing any contact with the stimulus bar. Trimming whiskers significantly reduced performance to chance levels (Figures 2A and 2B; p < 0.001), confirming that mice solved the task through whisker touch and not through other sensory cues, such as motor sounds. We hypothesized that orientation perception may depend on integration over the whisker pad. Therefore, we wanted to find out whether contacts from multiple whiskers were required to solve the task. To address this directly, we measured performance as we acutely trimmed the whisker array to different combinations of whiskers (Figure 2A). We hypothesized that mice would require at least two whiskers, presumably in different rows (i.e., along an arc), to obtain relevant information about object orientation. Whiskers in different rows could discriminate positive from negative orientations by computing the relative horizontal position of object contact; in contrast, whiskers in the same row would only access the object at nearly the same elevation and, therefore, have less information on object orientation. Trimming the whiskers to a row of four or fewer significantly impaired task performance, with discriminability dropping to chance levels (Figures 2C, 2E, and 2F; p < 0.01). In contrast, trimming to an arc of whiskers did not affect performance (Figures 2D–2F; p = 0.74). In fact, even just two whiskers in an arc were sufficient to perform the task (Figures 2D–2F). Importantly, however, trimming to one whisker abolished performance (Figures 2D–2F). These results demonstrate that mice solved the orientation discrimination task specifically by integrating multiple whiskers in an arc; contact information from a single whisker was insufficient. A similar study showed that mice with only one whisker can discriminate object orientation (Kim et al., 2020Kim J. Erskine A. Cheung J.A. Hires S.A. Behavioral and Neural Bases of Tactile Shape Discrimination Learning in Head-Fixed Mice.Neuron. 2020; 108: 953-967.e8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), perhaps by adopting alternative whisking strategies or relying on the differing deflections of the remaining whisker. However, our data indicate that, when trained with multiple whiskers in this task, the default strategy the mice use is to summate sensory information over at least two whiskers along an arc. Orientation perception should be invariant to the vantage point or absolute location of the object. Therefore, we next wanted to find out whether trained mice use the orientation of the stimulus bar per se to solve the task rather than a more specific code that relies on contacting the stimulus bar with a specific set of whiskers in a specific location. Using high-speed whisker tracking data, we found that mice with intact whiskers primarily contacted the stimulus bar with their frontmost whisker arcs and rarely made contact with the middle or back arcs prior to making their decision (Figure 3A). When their whiskers were acutely trimmed to a single middle arc (arc 2), they showed no significant drop in performance even though they had not previously employed this arc to solve the task (Figure 3A). Thus, mice could immediately use these alternate whiskers to solve the task, indicating that they were employing a more general orientation perception-based strategy. Next we designed an experiment in a new group of mice that would not require whisker trimming. We hypothesized that, if mice were using an orientation-based rather than a specific whisker/location-based strategy to solve the task, then behavioral performance should be unaffected by acutely presenting the oriented stimulus bar in random horizontal locations in the whisking field. Thus, mice should discriminate the bar’s orientation with different sets of whiskers in different trials. Therefore, we jittered the absolute horizontal location of the oriented bar, trial by trial, and monitored the effect on each mouse’s performance. For these experiments, the stimulus bar was moved in from the side (lateral presentation) rather than from the front to prevent the mice from solving the task while the stimulus bar was still moving toward its final position (Figure 3B). Although these mice were initially trained with the stimulus moving in from the front (rostral presentation), all mice quickly acclimatized to lateral presentation (1–3 days). When they regained their original performance level, we began presenting the stimulus to one of three positions, each engaging different sets of whiskers. All three positions were interleaved randomly in the test session. Three of five test mice maintained high levels of performance (d’ > 1.5) across all of the positions, strongly suggesting that these mice solved the task by sensing the stimulus orientation per se (Figures 3C and 3D). The other two mice showed a drop in performance only for the more distant position (position 2 [pos2]), which returned to baseline proficiency in 1–4 days. The transient drop in performance for these two mice might be due to the difficulty in acclimatizing to altered task conditions (multiple final locations of the stimulus) or to the need to re-learn new spatial rules for the two additional stimulus positions. The latter explanation would require them to solve the task by remembering three unique spatial coding rules as opposed to a single orientation-based rule. These data show that mice can solve the task with multiple strategies but that the majority of tested mice learn a more generalizable orientation-based rule. To control for a strategy where mice adaptively adjust their whisking to different stimulus positions and, thus, are still able to solve the task with a spatial rule (in coordinates invariant to the whisking field), we tracked the motion of the whiskers with high-speed imaging. Whisker tracking showed that whisking properties were largely invariant across the different jitter positions (Figure 3E). Furthermore, high-speed video analysis showed that different whiskers primarily contacted the stimulus bar at each of the different jitter positions (Figure 3F). These results suggest that mice that showed no acute drop in performance when the stimulus bar was presented to different horizontal locations use different sets of whiskers to determine the orientation of the stimulus bar and solve the task. Next we sought to address the neural basis for object orientation discrimination. Because we showed that mice integrate over multiple whiskers to solve the task, we began by recording neural activity in the barrel cortex, whose neurons integrate over the whisker array (Brumberg et al., 1996Brumberg J.C.

We trained transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s in excitatory neurons of the cortex on the task with a full whisker pad (camk2-tTa; tetO-GCaMP6s mice; Wekselblatt et al., 2016Wekselblatt J.B.

Following training, we imaged activity in the barrel cortex with volumetric calcium imaging, collecting neural data from approximately 1,000 neurons per recording in 3 planes of an ∼800 × 800 μm field of view (Figures S4A and S4B), encompassing several columns of the barrel cortex. We relied on Suite2P for source extraction and neuropil subtraction (STAR Methods; Figures S4C–S4H; Pachitariu et al., 2016Pachitariu M. Stringer C. Schröder S. Dipoppa M. Rossi L.F. Carandini M. Harris K.D. Suite2p: beyond 10,000 neurons with standard two-photon microscopy.bioRxiv. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1101/061507Crossref Google Scholar). To explore stimulus-evoked activity, we analyzed calcium activity (both fluorescence: ΔF/F and deconvolved calcium activity; STAR Methods), beginning at the estimated time of first whisker contact and extending to the end of the behavioral response window, 0.5 s prior to reward delivery (Figure 4A; see STAR Methods and Figure S5, where expanded and restricted time windows are considered). Across the imaged population of neurons, about 45% of identified neurons showed significant responses during presentation of the stimulus bar (see classification in STAR Methods), and about one third showed significant tuning across the stimuli (Video S1; Figures 4B–4D). Importantly, we identified neurons in each mouse that responded best to each of the eight presented stimuli (Figures 4D and S6). This distribution of neuronal tuning across the discriminated orientations was robust because it was observable after cross-validation (Figures 4D and S7A) and visible across a wide range of analysis conditions (Figures S5A, S5B, and S7B–S7D). We validated that the imaging resolution of our optical system was sufficient to resolve individual cells without cross-contamination (Figures S4C–S4J; STAR Methods). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/6fbef7cf-3fda-4df8-abea-774c719d3f58/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Somatosensory neurons respond to an oriented stimulus, related to Figure 4Motion-corrected and trial-averaged pixel-wise ΔF/F evoked by oriented stimulus across all three planes from a single recording. Depth below the dura for each imaging plane is listed above each panel. Magenta square indicates the time that the stimulus is present, with the corresponding stimulus orientation listed above. Imaged at 6Hz, playback speed is 2× real time. To quantify the selectivity of neural responses, we computed a selectivity index (STAR Methods). Across all cells, the selectivity index was much higher than shuffled controls or randomly generated data (Figure S7E; p < 1e−99, rank sum test). Across the population of imaged neurons, we observed a bias toward neurons encoding NOGO orientations, which may be due to earlier contact times with NOGO stimuli (Figures S2E, S2F, and S2H), more contacts on NOGO trials (Figure S2G), different whisker kinematics following contact with the angled bar, other asymmetries in the stimulation or recording setup (Figure S3), or a physiological bias toward representing these orientations (Vilarchao et al., 2018Vilarchao M.E.

Supra-barrel Distribution of Directional Tuning for Global Motion in the Mouse Somatosensory Cortex.Cell Rep. 2018; 22: 3534-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This overrepresentation was not dependent on task training because we also observed it in naive, untrained mice (Figure S5D). Despite this overrepresentation of cells selective for NOGO orientations, dimensionality reduction (STAR Methods) revealed that the population of imaged neurons smoothly represented and could discriminate all stimulus orientations (Figure 4E). In each recording, the population responses for each stimulus orientation diverged shortly after the estimated first whisker contact, indicating a high level of discriminability within the earliest touches (Figure S7F). Although the barrel cortex exhibits topographic maps of whisker input (Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970Woolsey T.A. Van der Loos H. The structural organization of layer IV in the somatosensory region (S I) of mouse cerebral cortex.Brain Res. 1970; 17: 205-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar) and spatial input in the whisking field (Pluta et al., 2017Pluta S.R. Lyall E.H. Telian G.I. Ryapolova-Webb E. Adesnik H. Surround Integration Organizes a Spatial Map during Active Sensation.Neuron. 2017; 94: 1220-1233.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we did not observe any obvious organization of orientation selectivity, although we cannot rule out finer structure; further investigation is required. In all recorded mice, neurons with distinct tuning preferences appeared to be intermingled (Figures 4F and S6); this observation was robust to the analysis window (Figure S5C). We next asked how the animal’s behavior and trial type modulated neural activity in the barrel cortex. Although the stimulus bar’s orientation was the strongest predictor of most neurons’ responses in the task, trial type (GO versus NOGO) as well as motor decision (lick versus no lick) also modulated the activity of many neurons, consistent with prior results (Yang et al., 2016Yang H.

Previously, we showed that there is elevated Notch signaling compared to normal renal epithelial cells and that Notch signaling contributes to the proliferation of cystic cells. Quinomycin A, a bis-intercalator peptide, has previously been shown to target the Notch signaling pathway and inhibit tumor growth in cancer. Here, we show that Quinomycin A decreased cell proliferation and cyst growth of human ADPKD cyst epithelial cells cultured within a 3D collagen gel. Treatment with Quinomycin A reduced kidney weight to body weight ratio and decreased renal cystic area and fibrosis in Pkd1RC/RC; Pkd2+/− mice, an orthologous PKD mouse model. This was accompanied by reduced expression of Notch pathway proteins, RBPjk and HeyL and cell proliferation in kidneys of PKD mice. Quinomycin A treatments also normalized cilia length of cyst epithelial cells derived from the collecting ducts. This is the first study to demonstrate that Quinomycin A effectively inhibits PKD progression and suggests that Quinomycin A has potential therapeutic value for PKD patients."

We sought to investigate the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Uganda cancer patients, their pre-chemotherapy left ventricular strain echocardiographic pattern and its associations with the CVD risk factors. Methods and results Baseline pre-chemotherapy data of patients who were enrolled in the SATRACD study (a cancer cohort, who were planned for anthracycline therapy), were analyzed. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and baseline strain echocardiographic images were assessed. Among the 355 patients who were recruited over a period of 15 months, 283 (79.7%) were female, with a mean age of 43 years. The types of cancer of the study patients included breast cancer (70.6%), lymphomas, sarcomas, leukemias and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (27.0%). The prevalence of obesity was 12.1% and that of HIV was 18.3%. All patients had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The mean global longitudinal strain (GLS) was -20.92 ±2.43%, with females having a significantly higher GLS than males (-21.09±2.42 vs -20.25±2.39, p = 0.008). Fifty-three patients (14.9%) had suboptimal GLS (absolute GLS≤18.00%), which was associated with obesity (POR = 3.07; 95% CI, 1.31–6.98; p = 0.003), alcohol use (POR = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.01–3.74; p = 0.044), long QTc interval in electrocardiogram (POR = 2.54; 95% CI, 1.06–5.74; p = 0.015,) and impaired left ventricular relaxation (POR = 2.24; 95% CI, 1.17–4.25; p = 0.007). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, obesity (POR = 2.95; 95% CI, 1.24–7.03; p = 0.014) was the only independent factor associated with suboptimal GLS. Conclusion There is high prevalence and a unique pattern of cardiovascular risk factors in Uganda cancer patients. In cancer patients with cardiovascular risk conditions, there is reduction in GLS despite preserved LVEF. Longitudinal research is needed to study the predictive value of cardiovascular risk factors and baseline GLS for post chemotherapy cardiac dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W3149897898,"Staphylopine (StP) and other nicotianamine-like metallophores are crucial for many pathogens to acquire the transition metals from hosts during invasion. CntL from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCntL) catalyzes the condensation of the 2-aminobutyrate (Ab) moiety of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) with D-histidine in the biosynthesis of StP. Here, we report the crystal structures of SaCntL in complex with either SAM or two products. The structure of SaCntL consists of an N-terminal four-helix bundle (holding catalytic residue E84) and a C-terminal Rossmann fold (binding the substrates). The sequence connecting the N- and C-terminal domains (N-C linker) in SaCntL was found to undergo conformational alternation between open and closed states. Our structural and biochemical analyses suggested that this intrinsically dynamic interdomain linker forms an additional structural module that plays essential roles in ligand diffusion, recognition, and catalysis. We confirmed that SaCntL stereoselectively carries out the catalysis of D-His but not its enantiomer, L-His, and we found that the N-C linker and active site of SaCntL could accommodate both enantiomers. SaCntL is likely able to bind L-His without catalysis, and as a result, L-His could show inhibitory effects toward SaCntL. These findings provide critical structural and mechanistic insights into CntL, which facilitates a better understanding of the biosynthesis of nicotianamine-like metallophores and the discovery of inhibitors of this process."

Additionally, two random forest regression models were presented for estimating the turnaround time and the elapsed time of flight agents in the agent-based delay prediction model. The parameter models were trained and fitted using the flight data for 2017 in the United States. The performance of the delay prediction model was tested for thirty days with three types of delay levels (low, medium, and high), which were randomly selected from 2018. The experimental results showed that the average absolute error in the test days was 6.8 min, and the classification accuracy with a 15 min threshold for a two-hour forecast horizon was 89.5%.

Paracrine fibroblast growth factor 8b (FGF8b) strongly induces Ucp1 transcription in white adipocytes independent of adipogenesis. Here, we report that FGF8b and other paracrine FGFs act on brown and white preadipocytes to upregulate Ucp1 expression via a FGFR1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 axis, independent of adipogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an upregulation of prostaglandin biosynthesis and glycolysis upon Fgf8b treatment of preadipocytes. Oxylipin measurement by LC-MS/MS in FGF8b conditioned media identified prostaglandin E2 as a putative mediator of FGF8b induced Ucp1 transcription. RNA interference and pharmacological inhibition of the prostaglandin E2 biosynthetic pathway confirmed that PGE2 is causally involved in the control over Ucp1 transcription. Importantly, impairment of or failure to induce glycolytic flux blunted the induction of Ucp1, even in the presence of PGE2. Lastly, a screening of transcription factors identified Nrf1 and Hes1 as required regulators of FGF8b induced Ucp1 expression. Thus, we conclude that paracrine FGFs co-regulate prostaglandin and glucose metabolism to induce Ucp1 expression in a Nrf1/Hes1-dependent manner in preadipocytes, revealing a novel regulatory network in control of Ucp1 expression in a formerly unrecognized cell type."

However, such studies are rare though they are critically important to develop vigorous strategies to improve PNC service utilization. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the magnitude and factors associated with returning to health facilities for PNC among mothers who delivered in Ethiopian health facilities after they were discharged. Methods This cross-sectional study used 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data. A total of 2405mothers who gave birth in a health facility were included in this study. Multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model was fitted to estimate both independent (fixed) effects of the explanatory variables and community-level (random) effects on return for PNC utilization. Variable with p-value of ≤ 0.25 from unadjusted multilevel logistic regression were selected to develop three models and p-value of ≤0.05 was used to declare significance of the explanatory variables on the outcome variable in the final (adjusted) model. Analysis was done using IBM SPSS statistics version 21. Result In this analysis, from the total 2405 participants, 14.3% ((95%CI: 12.1–16.8), (n = 344)) of them returned to health facilities for PNC use after they gave birth at a health facility. From the multilevel logistic regression analysis, being employed (AOR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.04–2.19), receiving eight and above antenatal care visits (AOR = 2.90, 95%CI: 1.05–8.00), caesarean section delivery (AOR = 2.53, 95%CI: 1.40–4.58) and rural residence (AOR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.36–0.88) were found significantly associated with return to health facilities for PNC use among women who gave birth at health facility. Conclusion Facility-based PNC utilization among mothers who delivered at health facilities is low in Ethiopia. Both individual and community level variables were determined women to return to health facilities for PNC use. Thus, adopting context-specific strategies/policies could improve PNC utilization and should be paid a due focus."
https://openalex.org/W3151082914,"Differences in fundamental frequency (F0) or pitch between competing voices facilitate our ability to segregate a target voice from interferers, thereby enhancing speech intelligibility. Although lower-numbered harmonics elicit a stronger and more accurate pitch sensation than higher-numbered harmonics, it is unclear whether the stronger pitch leads to an increased benefit of pitch differences when segregating competing talkers. To answer this question, sentence recognition was tested in young normal-hearing listeners in the presence of a single competing talker. The stimuli were presented in a broadband condition or were highpass or lowpass filtered to manipulate the pitch accuracy of the voicing, while maintaining roughly equal speech intelligibility in the highpass and lowpass regions. Performance was measured with average F0 differences (ΔF0) between the target and single-talker masker of 0, 2, and 4 semitones. Pitch discrimination abilities were also measured to confirm that the lowpass-filtered stimuli elicited greater pitch accuracy than the highpass-filtered stimuli. No interaction was found between filter type and ΔF0 in the sentence recognition task, suggesting little or no effect of harmonic rank or pitch accuracy on the ability to use F0 to segregate natural voices, even when the average ΔF0 is relatively small. The results suggest that listeners are able to obtain some benefit of pitch differences between competing voices, even when pitch salience and accuracy is low."
https://openalex.org/W3143810827,"When a stimulus is associated with an external reward, its chance of being consolidated into long-term memory is boosted via dopaminergic facilitation of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Given that higher temporal distance (TD) has been found to discount the subjective value of a reward, we hypothesized that memory performance associated with a more immediate reward will result in better memory performance. We tested this hypothesis by measuring both behavioral memory performance and brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during memory encoding and retrieval tasks. Contrary to our hypothesis, both behavioral and fMRI results suggest that the TD of rewards might enhance the chance of the associated stimulus being remembered. The fMRI data demonstrate that the lateral prefrontal cortex, which shows encoding-related activation proportional to the TD, is reactivated when searching for regions that show activation proportional to the TD during retrieval. This is not surprising given that this region is not only activated to discriminate between future vs. immediate rewards, it is also a part of the retrieval-success network. These results provide support for the conclusion that the encoding-retrieval overlap provoked as the rewards are more delayed may lead to better memory performance of the items associated with the rewards."

Linear mixed-effects models assessed differences in PlayerLoad™ per minute and metreage per minute between activity types (Specialist, Skill Drills, Set-piece, Match Scenarios, Practice Match-play, and Competition Match-play) for positional groupings (Defenders, Midcourters, and Goalers). Competition Match-play resulted in higher (p &lt; 0.05) PlayerLoad™ than all training activity types, with the largest magnitudes of difference between Specialist–Competition ( d = 0.44–0.59; small to medium) and Skill Drills–Competition ( d = 0.35–0.63; small to medium) for all positional groups. The smallest difference was found between Match Scenarios–Competition ( d = 0.12–0.20; trivial to small) and Practice Match-play–Competition ( d = 0.12–0.14; trivial). Competition Match-play also resulted in higher (p &lt; 0.05) metreage per minute than Specialist ( d = 0.23–0.53; small to medium), Skill Drills ( d = 0.19–0.61; trivial to medium) and Set-piece ( d = 0.05–0.31; trivial to small). Training activity demands in order of least to most similar to competition were specialist, skill drills, set-piece, match scenarios, and practice match-play. We provide data that enables coaches and physical preparation staff to incorporate progressions into their training session designs that can replicate the movement intensity demands of competition in training."
https://openalex.org/W3149989891,"The purpose is to experimentally examine the effect of disclosing the risk probability of each unit in a production system on human behavior and the resulting system reliability. We used an economic experiment based on the theoretical model of Hausken (2002) to evaluate the effect of disclosing the relation between effort and unit reliability. We conducted first the non-disclosed-risk experiment and then the disclosed-risk experiment within subjects in both series and parallel systems. Our experimental results show that disclosing the relation between effort and unit reliability has two positive effects. First, subjects succeeded in improving the system reliability while cutting back on efforts to reduce the risk of their units when the risk probability was disclosed. In each system, the disclosed-risk condition achieves significantly higher system reliability on average than does the non-disclosed-risk condition, although the average level of effort is significantly lower under the disclosed-risk condition than under the non-disclosed-risk condition. Second, disclosing the risk probability simplified the subjects’ decision-making process and reduced its cost because subjects made their decisions on the amount of effort to exert based only on the risk probability information without considering other factors, such as the number of accidents."
