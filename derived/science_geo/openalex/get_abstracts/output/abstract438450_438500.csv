https://openalex.org/W2088027515,"Poor individuals often engage in behaviors, such as excessive borrowing, that reinforce the conditions of poverty. Some explanations for these behaviors focus on personality traits of the poor. Others emphasize environmental factors such as housing or financial access. We instead consider how certain behaviors stem simply from having less. We suggest that scarcity changes how people allocate attention: It leads them to engage more deeply in some problems while neglecting others. Across several experiments, we show that scarcity leads to attentional shifts that can help to explain behaviors such as overborrowing. We discuss how this mechanism might also explain other puzzles of poverty."

Previous results indicate that chondrules formed 1 to 2 million years after the inclusions—an age difference that has been used in constructing models of chondrule formation. Based on uranium- and lead-isotope measurements of a collection of these primitive materials, Connelly et al. (p. 651 ) show that chondrules in fact started to form at the same time as the inclusions, 4.567 billion years ago, and that their formation took about 3 million years."

Copper-mediated coupling of aryl halides with amines was reported by Ullman more than a century ago and remains in use today for the synthesis of certain organic compounds. However, the reaction generally requires high temperature to proceed efficiently. Creutz et al. (p. 647 ) have developed a photochemical variant that uses copper and reacts at room temperature or below, apparently by a radical mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2127053176,"CD44 is a major cell surface receptor for the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). Native high molecular weight hyaluronan (nHA) and oligosaccharides of hyaluronan (oHA) provoke distinct biological effects upon binding to CD44. Despite the importance of such interactions, however, the feature of binding with CD44 at the cell surface and the molecular basis for functional distinction between different sizes of HA is still unclear. In this study we investigated the effects of high and low molecular weight hyaluronan on CD44 clustering. For the first time, we provided direct evidence for a strong relationship between HA size and CD44 clustering in vivo. In CD44-transfected COS-7 cells, we showed that exogenous nHA stimulated CD44 clustering, which was disrupted by oHA. Moreover, naturally expressed CD44 was distributed into clusters due to abundantly expressed nHA in HK-2 cells (human renal proximal tubule cells) and BT549 cells (human breast cancer cell line) without exogenous stimulation. Our results suggest that native HA binding to CD44 selectively induces CD44 clustering, which could be inhibited by oHA. Finally, we demonstrated that HA regulates cell adhesion in a manner specifically dependent on its size. oHA promoted cell adhesion while nHA showed no effects. Our results might elucidate a molecular- and/or cellular-based mechanism for the diverse biological activities of nHA and oHA.

The most widely distributed form of HA in normal tissues is native high molecular weight HA (called HMW-HA or nHA) with a high molecular weight (∼107 Da). The lower molecular weight forms of HA, also called hyaluronan oligosaccharides (oHA), are synthesized de novo or generated by either hyaluronidase-mediated degradation or oxidative hydrolysis of native HA under pathological conditions (1.Jiang D.

CD44 is a major cell surface receptor for HA, which has an N-terminal link module homology domain that is responsible for binding to HA.

For example, the differences in HA chain length can influence both HA binding features and its functional consequences. High and low molecular weight forms of HA provoke distinct pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects upon binding to CD44 and can deliver either proliferative or anti-proliferative signals in appropriate cell types (15.Noble P.W.

Many studies showed that nHA exhibited anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects in several in vivo assays, inhibiting cell migration, proliferation, and sprout formation. In contrast, oHA stimulated cell proliferation and motility, exhibiting pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic effects in a variety of experimental systems (19.Gao F. Yang C.X. Mo W. Liu Y.W. He Y.Q.

We previously reported that nHA and oHA regulated cell cycle progression through G1 phase in distinct manner in vascular endothelial cells (19.Gao F. Yang C.X. Mo W. Liu Y.W. He Y.Q. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides are potential stimulators to angiogenesis via RHAMM mediated signal pathway in wound healing.Clin. Invest. Med. 2008; 31: E106-E116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these reports demonstrate that the interaction of CD44 with oHA and nHA exerts distinct effects on cell biological behavior, the precise feature of the CD44 binding in response to different molecular weight HA remains obscure. In living cells the extracellular matrix including hyaluronan plays important role in the maintenance of appropriate cell-cell communication (22.Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. Hyaluronan and CD44 antagonize mitogen-dependent cyclin D1 expression in mesenchymal cells.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Once the balance is disrupted, such as in tumor invasion, inflammation, or tissue remodeling, native high molecular weight HA is digested into small fragments (oHA). The loss of nHA and the appearance of its lower molecular weight forms could contribute to the changes of cell behavior and cell signaling. The most significant feature of HA is its highly repetitive nature. Therefore, the highly multivalent repeating disaccharide chains of HA interact with multiple, closely arrayed CD44 receptor molecules (23.Wolny P.M. Banerji S. Gounou C. Brisson A.R. Day A.J. Jackson D.G. Richter R.P. Analysis of CD44-hyaluronan interactions in an artificial membrane system. Insights into the distinct binding properties of high and low molecular weight hyaluronan.J. Biol.

However, the affinity of a single CD44-HA binding domain for HA is likely to be very low (10.Bollyky P.L. Falk B.A. Wu R.P. Buckner J.H. Wight T.N. Nepom G.T.

Up to now, the molecular basis for functional distinction between the binding of CD44 with different sizes of HA is largely unclear. Clustering of CD44 is a typical character that affects cell response after stimulated by highly produced HA (26.Sleeman J. Rudy W. Hofmann M. Moll J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Regulated clustering of variant CD44 proteins increases their hyaluronate binding capacity.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this study we utilized a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique to investigate the effects of oHA and nHA on CD44 clustering in COS-7 cells transfected with CD44 expression vectors. Furthermore, we chose HK-2 cells (human renal proximal tubule cells) and BT-549 cells (human breast cancer cell line) to evaluate the binding of oHA or endogenous nHA to CD44 because HK-2 and BT-549 cells naturally express abundantly CD44 and HA in naive status. We demonstrated that nHA induced CD44 clustering, which could be disrupted by oHA. These results provide direct evidence that high and low molecular weight forms of HA have distinct effects on CD44 clustering. CD44 mAb (clone IM7, catalog no. 12-0441-81) for flow cytometry analysis was purchased from eBioscience. Biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein was from Merck.

All other chemicals were of reagent grade or higher. The cDNA encoding the hematopoietic form of CD44 (CD44-H) was obtained by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using total RNA isolated from human peripheral blood lymphocytes and subcloned into the mammalian expression vectors pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The isoform CD44-H was used to denote a 80–90-kDa product (29.Jiang H. Peterson R.S Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W.

A plasmid encoding a positive control for the FRET experiment, PMT-CFP-YFP, was kindly provided by Dr. Thorsten Wohland (Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, Singapore) (30.Liu P.

In the positive control plasmid the plasma membrane target (PMT) sequence was fused to CFP at the N terminus, and the YFP gene was amplified and fused to CFP at the C terminus. Mammalian cells COS-7 (simian virus 40-transformed African Green monkey kidney cell line), HK-2 cells (human renal proximal tubule cell line), and human breast cancer cells BT549 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. COS-7 cells were grown to 85% confluency and transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, COS-7 cells were incubated with 40 μg/ml fl-HA (Merck) for 1 h at 4 °C as described previously (29.Jiang H. Peterson R.S Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10531-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), then the cells were treated by EDTA and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde and nuclear counterstaining by propidium iodide, plasma membrane-bound fl-HA was observed under a confocal microscope (Nikon A1, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA). Cultured cells were harvested and washed with washing buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). A single cell suspension (106/ml) was incubated with specific antibodies or isotope control antibodies on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed 3 times with washing buffer, and 1 μl of the specific antibody was added for 1 h on ice. Cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). At least 6000 cells were analyzed per sample in all experiments. All experiments were performed at least twice. FRET spectroscopy was performed essentially as described previously (31.Felber L.M. Cloutier S.M. Kündig C. Kishi T. Brossard V. Jichlinski P. Leisinger H.J. Deperthes D. Evaluation of the CFP-substrate-YFP system for protease studies. Advantages and limitations.Biotechniques. 2004; 36: 878-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were plated into 96-well black plates for 24 h then transfected with plasmids encoding CD44-YFP and CD44-CFP, PMT-CFP-YFP, or co-transfected with CD44-YFP and CD44-CFP. For FRET measurements, fluorescence intensities of CFP, YFP, and PMT-CFP-YFP were measured using a microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). After an excitation narrowed at 440 nm, the special excitation channel of CFP, emission fluorescence was obtained at 485 ± 10 nm (CFP emission peak) and 528 ± 10 nm (YFP emission peak). If FRET occurs, the fluorescence at 528 nm will be enhanced for efficient energy transfer between donor and acceptor. A modified method for FRET evaluation was applied according to a previous report (31.Felber L.M. Cloutier S.M. Kündig C. Kishi T. Brossard V. Jichlinski P. Leisinger H.J. Deperthes D. Evaluation of the CFP-substrate-YFP system for protease studies. Advantages and limitations.Biotechniques. 2004; 36: 878-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calculation of the ratio between emission at 528 and 485 nm was used as an indicator of FRET efficiency. Higher values of 528/485-nm ratio indicated higher efficiency of FRET values. Fluorescence from non-transfected cells and background scattering light brought by the equipment was subtracted from each sample to obtain the specific fluorescence. A primary dose-response experiment with varying concentrations of oHA was performed using a microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Cells co-transfected with CD44-YFP and CD44-CFP were pretreated with nHA, then incubated with different doses of oHA (0, 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 μg/ml). The fluorescence was recorded in monochromatic mode with excitation at 440 nm and emission at 485 and 528 nm. The FRET efficiency, the ratio between emission at 528 and 485 nm, was used as an indicator of the dose-dependent changes in HA treatments. FRET imaging was performed basically as described before (32.Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Gotoh Y. Matsuda M.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7317-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) on a confocal laser scanning microscopy (Nikon A1, Tokyo, Japan). For sensitized fluorescence emission measurements, images were acquired sequentially through YFP, CFP, and FRET channels. The microscopy sets used were YFP (excitation, 500/25 nm; emission, 526–568 nm), CFP (excitation, 458 nm; emission, 461–504 nm), and FRET (excitation, 458 nm; emission, 526–568 nm). FRET efficiency was determined using NIS-Elements AR3.1 Imaging software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence through the FRET channel consisted of a FRET component (“corrected” FRET, FRET) and non-FRET components, including spectral bleed through and cross-excited fluorescence. The non-FRET components were subtracted as described previously (34.Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Interaction of EGF receptor and grb2 in living cells visualized by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). FRETC was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire ”region of interest” image, where FRET, CFP, and YFP were presented as background-subtracted fluorescence intensities acquired through the FRET, CFP, and YFP channels, respectively. In our experimental conditions we used the following equation: FRETC = FRET − 0.55 × CFP − 0.11 × YFP. The 0.55 and 0.11 were the fractions of bleed-through of CFP and YFP fluorescence to the FRET channel, respectively. The fractions were calculated by measuring fluorescence intensities of cells individually expressing CD44-CFP or CD44-YFP through the CFP, YFP, and FRET channels. All the experiments were performed at room temperature. Confocalmicroscopy imaging and photobleaching experiments were performed at room temperature using an Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscopy system. If any interactions leading to energy transfer were present in the cells, photobleaching of the acceptor would lead to an increase in donor fluorescence because it would no longer be quenched by the acceptor. In the photobleaching experiments, a 60-s pulse of high intensity laser at 514 nm (100% exposure at 514 nm beam) was applied to locally bleach the YFP signal acceptor in a whole cell. Data acquisition was performed in the sequential line mode for the best spatiotemporal reliability. The sample area was scanned at the resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. The CFP and YFP were excited at 458 and 514 nm, respectively. Two frames of pre-bleaching and post-bleaching CFP (donor) fluorescence intensities were recorded. The FRET efficiency (E) was calculated by E = 1 − (Fpre/Fpost)·Fpre, where Fpre and Fpost indicate the fluorescence intensity of the donor before and after acceptor photobleaching, respectively. The clustering of CD44 was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. HK-2 and BT-549 cells were cultured on glass coverslips, then incubated with DMEM (control), oHA, hyaluronidase, and 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU). After incubation, cells were washed briefly with PBS, fixated in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, then permeabilized using Triton X-100 (0.1% v/v in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with anti-CD44 antibody (156–3C11) overnight at 4 °C, then stained with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated chicken anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The coverslips were then placed onto slides using glycerol as a mountant and visualized under confocal microscopy (Nikon A1, Tokyo, Japan). To understand the effect of oHA on endogenous hyaluronan generation, the amount of liberated and cell-associated hyaluronan was determined as described previously (35.Udabage L. Brownlee G.R. Nilsson S.K. Brown T.J. The over-expression of HAS2, Hyal-2 and CD44 is implicated in the invasiveness of breast cancer.Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 310: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Triplicate cultures of cells were seeded in a 6-well culture plate and grown for 24 h to 85% confluence. Cells were treated with different doses of oHA (0, 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 μg/ml) for 2 h then harvested by trypsinization and counted using a Coulter counter. Media were used for quantitation of the liberated HA. Cell-associated extracellular HA was obtained by centrifugation of the cell/trypsin fraction at 2000 rpm in a Beckman TJ-6 centrifuge where the supernatant was quantitated for HA. The extracellular liberated and cell-associated fractions were pooled and characterized for HA concentration with the 125I-labeled HA radioimmunoassay, the detection limits of which is >5.5 ng/ml. Cells were treated with DMEM, oHA, testicular hyaluronidase or 4-MU, then the cells were washed 5 times with ice-cold PBS (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0). CD44 cross-linking was performed by incubation with 2 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C and quenched by incubation with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer. Cells were harvested and homogenized in ice-cold sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) lysis buffer. Total cell lysates were collected, and equal quantities of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% skimmed milk powder for 1 h, washed for 1 h in TBS, and incubated with CD44 (156–3C11, Cell Signal) or phospho-ERK1/2 mAb (Cell Signal) at 4 °C for 3 h. Then the membranes were washed with 1× Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS/T) buffer for three times (5 min each time) and incubated with HRP-conjugated polyclonal secondary antibody for 1 h. The membranes were developed with the enhanced plus chemiluminescence assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The adhesion of cells was examined as previously described (36.Spessotto P. Rossi F.M. Degan M. Di Francia R. Perris R. Colombatti A. Gattei V.

After being pretreated with control (DMEM), oHA, and nHA for 2 h, cells were detached with 5 mm PBS/EDTA. Cells (5 × 103) in spreading medium (DMEM with 0.1% heat-inactivated FBS) were seeded onto a 96-well plate. After 30 min at 37 °C, unbound cells were removed, and the remaining cells were counted. Treatment with ERK inhibitor (U0126; 5 μm, 24 h) was performed to detect the effect of inhibition of ERK on cell adhesive ability. Three independent experiments were performed. The data were presented as the mean ± S.D. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS11.0. The unpaired Student's t test was used for the comparisons between two different groups. p less than 0.05 was considered significant. COS-7 cells were chosen to characterize CD44-CFP and CD44-YFP constructs due to the absence of endogenous expression of CD44 and hyaluronan in these cells (Fig. 1A, first lane, and supplemental Figs. S1). Western blot analysis revealed a band at ∼85 kDa in pCD44H-transfected COS-7 cells, corresponding to the molecular weight of the standard form of human CD44 (Fig. 1A, second and third lanes). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that CD44 was successfully translocated onto the cell surface (Fig. 1B). As the negative control, no CD44 expression was detected in COS-7 cells transfected with mock vector (Fig. 1B). After transfection, captured fl-HA (green fluorescence) was visualized at the surface of CD44-transfected COS-7 cells by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis (Fig. 1, C and D). As negative control, untransfected cells showed no capacity to bind fl-HA (Fig. 1D). To evaluate the effects of nHA and oHA on CD44 clustering, we performed FRET. As shown in Fig. 2A. CD44-CFP emitted mainly at 485 nm and with lower intensity at 528 nm, although CD44-YFP showed emission mainly at 528 nm. Co-transfection of CD44-CFP and CD44-YFP initiated two separate emission intensities.

Understanding this duality lies at the heart of quantum mechanics. In two reports, Peruzzo et al. (p. 634 ) and Kaiser et al. (p. 637 ; see the Perspective on both papers by Lloyd ) perform an entangled version of John Wheeler's delayed-choice gedanken experiment, in which the choice of detection can be changed after a photon passes through a double-slit to avoid the measurement process affecting the state of the photon. The original proposal allowed the wave and particle nature of light to be interchanged after the light had entered the interferometer. By contrast in this study, entanglement allowed the wave and particle nature to be interchanged after the light was detected and revealed the quantum nature of the photon, for example, it displays wave- and particle-like behavior simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1975246615,"Ocean Monarchs It is hard to grasp that the unseen microorganisms of the oceans are the most productive on the planet, at orders of magnitude greater than sharks and whales or even terrestrial forests. The plankton is thus a major contributor to the geochemical cycles that are currently under pressure from climate change. Stocker (p. 628 ) reviews the state of knowledge of the web of myriad ephemeral microenvironments within the ocean's bulk and how microorganisms respond to the ever-shifting chemical spectrum. To this end, Taylor and Stocker (p. 675 ) report experiments on the effects of turbulence on nutrient uptake by chemotactic marine bacteria. They propose that turbulence favors motile bacteria that adopt an optimal foraging strategy, which trades off the relative high cost of motility to gain the benefits of plumes of nutrients by zipping between them at optimized speeds. Scaled up, such apparently “micro” behavior will influence the rate of remineralization of dissolved organic matter and in turn will feed into global patterns of geochemical cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2017282795,"Complementarity, that is the ability of a quantum object to behave either as a particle or as a wave, is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. An exemplary Gedanken experiment, emphasizing such a measurement-dependent nature, was suggested by Wheeler using single photons. The subtleness of the idea lies in the fact that the output beam-splitter of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is put in or removed after a photon has already entered the interferometer, thus performing a delayed test of the wave-particle complementary behavior. Recently, it was proposed that using a quantum analogue of the output beam-splitter would permit carrying out this type of test after the detection of the photon and observing wave-particle superposition. In this paper we describe an experimental demonstration of these predictions using another extraordinary property of quantum systems, entanglement. We use a pair of polarization entangled photons composed of one photon whose nature (wave or particle) is tested, and of a corroborative photon that allows determining which one, or both, of these two aspects is being tested. This corroborative photon infers the presence or absence of the beam-splitter and until it is measured, the beam-splitter is in a superposition of these two states, making it a quantum beam-splitter. When the quantum beam-splitter is in the state present or absent, the interferometer reveals the wave or particle nature of the test photon, respectively. Furthermore, by manipulating the corroborative photon, we can continuously morph, via entanglement, the test photon from wave to particle behavior even after it was detected. This result underlines the fact that a simple vision of light as a classical wave or a particle is inadequate."

Knowing that many types of stem cells undergo asymmetric cell divisions, Tran et al. (p. 679 ) probed the asymmetric division of Drosophila male germline stem cells and found that preexisting histones were selectively segregated to the stem cell, whereas new histones were enriched in the daughter cell that underwent differentiation. By contrast, asymmetric histone distribution was not seen in progenitor cells. This study suggests that stem cells retain preexisting canonical histones during asymmetric cell divisions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2018369483,"Aggressive epithelial cancer cells frequently adopt mesenchymal characteristics and exhibit aberrant interactions with their surroundings, including the vasculature. Whether the release/uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs) plays a role during these processes has not been studied. EVs are heterogeneous membrane structures that originate either at the surface (microparticles), or within (exosomes) activated or transformed cells, and are involved in intercellular trafficking of bioactive molecules. Here, we show that epithelial cancer cells (A431, DLD-1) adopt mesenchymal features (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like state) upon activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) coupled with blockade of E-cadherin. This treatment leads to a coordinated loss of EGFR and tissue factor (TF) from the plasma membrane and coincides with a surge in emission of small, exosome-like EVs containing both receptors. TF (but not EGFR) is selectively up-regulated in EVs produced by mesenchymal-like cancer cells and can be transferred to cultured endothelial cells rendering them highly procoagulant. We postulate that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like changes may alter cancer cell interactions with the vascular systems through altered vesiculation and TF shedding."
https://openalex.org/W2116379215,"Endothelial proliferation, which is an important process in vascular homeostasis, can be regulated by the extracellular microenvironment. In this study we demonstrated that proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs) was enhanced on hydrogels with high stiffness (HSG, 21.5 kPa) in comparison to those with low stiffness (LSG, 1.72 kPa). ECs on HSG showed markedly prominent stress fibers and a higher RhoA activity than ECs on LSG. Blockade of RhoA attenuated stress fiber formation and proliferation of ECs on HSG, but had little effect on ECs on LSG; enhancement of RhoA had opposite effects. The phosphorylations of Src and Vav2, which are positive RhoA upstream effectors, were higher in ECs on HSG. The inhibition of Src/Vav2 attenuated the HSG-mediated RhoA activation and EC proliferation but exhibited nominal effects on ECs on LSG. Septin 9 (SEPT9), the negative upstream effector for RhoA, was significantly higher in ECs on LSG. The inhibition of SEPT9 increased RhoA activation, Src/Vav2 phosphorylations, and EC proliferation on LSG, but showed minor effects on ECs on HSG. We further demonstrated that the inactivation of integrin α(v)β(3) caused an increase of SEPT9 expression in ECs on HSG to attenuate Src/Vav2 phosphorylations and inhibit RhoA-dependent EC proliferation. These results demonstrate that the SEPT9/Src/Vav2/RhoA pathway constitutes an important molecular mechanism for the mechanical regulation of EC proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2151359426,"We have recently shown that a molecular biomarker signature comprised of inflammatory, hormonal and growth factors occurs in the blood serum from first onset schizophrenia patients. Here, we use the same platform to investigate post mortem brain tissue (Brodmann area 10) from schizophrenia patients who were mainly chronically ill and drug treated. Twenty-one analytes are differentially expressed in post-mortem brain tissue. Comparison with our previous mRNA profiling studies of the same patient samples in another frontal cortical area showed that 9 of these molecules were also altered at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, 9 of the molecules were also altered in serum from living first onset schizophrenia patients compared to controls. We propose a model in which the brain and periphery are coordinated through hormones and other regulatory molecules released into the blood via the diffuse neuroendocrine system. These findings provide further evidence for the systemic nature of schizophrenia and give added validity to the concept that schizophrenia can be investigated through studies of blood-based biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2134864922,"Global change is predicted to promote plant invasions world-wide, reducing biodiversity and ecosystem function. Phenotypic plasticity may influence the ability of introduced plant species to invade and dominate extant communities. However, interpreting differences in plasticity can be confounded by phylogenetic differences in morphology and physiology. Here we present a novel case investigating the role of fitness trait values and phenotypic plasticity to global change factors between conspecific lineages of Phragmites australis. We hypothesized that due to observed differences in the competitive success of North American-native and Eurasian-introduced P. australis genotypes, Eurasian-introduced P. australis would exhibit greater fitness in response to global change factors. Plasticity and plant performance to ambient and predicted levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen pollution were investigated to understand how invasion pressure may change in North America under a realistic global change scenario. We found that the introduced Eurasian genotype expressed greater mean trait values in nearly every ecophysiological trait measured – aboveground and belowground – to elevated CO2 and nitrogen, outperforming the native North American conspecific by a factor of two to three under every global change scenario. This response is consistent with “jack and master” phenotypic plasticity. We suggest that differences in plant nitrogen productivity, specific leaf area, belowground biomass allocation, and inherently higher relative growth rate are the plant traits that may enhance invasion of Eurasian Phragmites in North America. Given the high degree of genotypic variability within this species, and our limited number of genotypes, our results must be interpreted cautiously. Our study is the first to demonstrate the potential importance of jack-and-master phenotypic plasticity in plant invasions when facing imminent global change conditions. We suggest that jack-and-master invasive genotypes and/or species similar to introduced P. australis will have an increased ecological fitness, facilitating their invasion in both stressful and resource rich environments."
https://openalex.org/W1992122074,"Background Docosahexaenoic acid, a major omega-3 essential fatty acid family member, improves behavioral deficit and reduces infarct volume and edema after experimental focal cerebral ischemia. We hypothesize that DHA elicits neuroprotection by inducing AKT/p70S6K phosphorylation, which in turn leads to cell survival and protects against ischemic stroke in young and aged rats. Methods and Results Rats underwent 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). DHA, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) or vehicle (saline) was administered 3 h after onset of stroke. Neurological function was evaluated on days 1, 2, 3, and 7. DHA treatment improved functional recovery and reduced cortical, subcortical and total infarct volumes 7 days after stroke. DHA also reduced microglia infiltration and increased the number of astrocytes and neurons when compared to vehicle on days 1 and 7. Increases in p473 AKT and p308 AKT phosphorylation/activation were observed in animals treated with DHA 4 h after MCAo. Activation of other members of the AKT signaling pathway were also observed in DHA treated animals including increases in pS6 at 4 h and pGSK at 24 h. DHA or NPD1 remarkably reduced total and cortical infarct in aged rats. Moreover, we show that in young and aged rats DHA treatment after MCAo potentiates NPD1 biosynthesis. The phosphorylation of p308 AKT or pGSK was not different between groups in aged rats. However, pS6 expression was increased with DHA or NPD1 treatment when compared to vehicle. Conclusions We suggest that DHA induces cell survival, modulates the neuroinflammatory response and triggers long term restoration of synaptic circuits. Both DHA and NPD1 elicited remarkable protection in aged animals. Accordingly, activation of DHA signaling might provide benefits in the management of ischemic stroke both acutely as well as long term to limit ensuing disabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2144228064,"Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer and a major reservoir of fixed carbon on earth. Comprehension of the elusive mechanism of its enzymatic degradation represents a fundamental problem at the interface of biology, biotechnology, and materials science. The interdependence of cellulose disintegration and hydrolysis and the synergistic interplay among cellulases is yet poorly understood. Here we report evidence from in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) that delineates degradation of a polymorphic cellulose substrate as a dynamic cycle of alternating exposure and removal of crystalline fibers. Direct observation shows that chain-end-cleaving cellobiohydrolases (CBH I, CBH II) and an internally chain-cleaving endoglucanase (EG), the major components of cellulase systems, take on distinct roles: EG and CBH II make the cellulose surface accessible for CBH I by removing amorphous-unordered substrate areas, thus exposing otherwise embedded crystalline-ordered nanofibrils of the cellulose. Subsequently, these fibrils are degraded efficiently by CBH I, thereby uncovering new amorphous areas. Without prior action of EG and CBH II, CBH I was poorly active on the cellulosic substrate. This leads to the conclusion that synergism among cellulases is morphology-dependent and governed by the cooperativity between enzymes degrading amorphous regions and those targeting primarily crystalline regions. The surface-disrupting activity of cellulases therefore strongly depends on mesoscopic structural features of the substrate: size and packing of crystalline fibers are key determinants of the overall efficiency of cellulose degradation."

In this study, we examined the role of endogenous TSG-6 in the pathophysiological responses associated with acute allergic pulmonary inflammation. Compared with wild-type littermate controls, TSG-6−/− mice exhibited attenuated inflammation marked by a significant decrease in pulmonary HA concentrations measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue.

Most importantly, contrary to their counterpart wild-type littermates, TSG-6−/− mice were resistant to the induction of airway hyperresponsiveness and manifested improved lung mechanics in response to methacholine challenge. Our study demonstrates that endogenous TSG-6 is dispensable for the induction of Th2 immunity but is essential for the robust increase in pulmonary HA deposition, propagation of acute eosinophilic pulmonary inflammation, and development of airway hyperresponsiveness.

https://openalex.org/W1968629035,"Modulation of integrin activation is important in many cellular functions including adhesion, migration, and assembly of the extracellular matrix. RSK2 functions downstream of Ras/Raf and promotes tumor cell motility and metastasis. We therefore investigated whether RSK2 affects integrin function. We report that RSK2 mediates Ras/Raf inactivation of integrins. As a result, we find that RSK2 impairs cell adhesion and integrin-mediated matrix assembly and promotes cell motility. Active RSK2 appears to affect integrins by reducing actin stress fibers and disrupting focal adhesions. Moreover, RSK2 co-localizes with the integrin activator talin and is present at integrin cytoplasmic tails. It is thereby in a position to modulate integrin activation and integrin-mediated migration. Activation of RSK2 promotes filamin phosphorylation and binding to integrins. We also find that RSK2 is activated in response to integrin ligation to fibronectin. Thus, RSK2 could participate in a feedback loop controlling integrin function. These results reveal RSK2 as a key regulator of integrin activity and provide a novel mechanism by which it may promote cell migration and cancer metastasis."

To this end, Hhs are released from local sources and act at a distance on target cells that express the Hh receptor Patched. However, morphogen secretion and spreading are not passive processes because all Hhs are synthesized as dually (N- and C-terminal) lipidated proteins that firmly tether to the surface of producing cells. On the cell surface, Hhs associate with each other and with heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. This raises the question of how Hh solubilization and spreading is achieved. We recently discovered that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is solubilized by proteolytic processing (shedding) of lipidated peptide termini in vitro. Because unprocessed N termini block Patched receptor binding sites in the cluster, we further suggested that their proteolytic removal is required for simultaneous Shh activation. In this work we confirm inactivity of unprocessed protein clusters and demonstrate restored biological Shh function upon distortion or removal of N-terminal amino acids and peptides. We further show that N-terminal Shh processing targets and inactivates the HS binding Cardin-Weintraub (CW) motif, resulting in soluble Shh clusters with their HS binding capacities strongly reduced.

The two-electron oxidation of dihydrosanguinarine catalyzed by dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase (DBOX) is the final step in sanguinarine biosynthesis. The formation of the fully conjugated ring system in sanguinarine is similar to the four-electron oxidations of (S)-canadine to berberine and (S)-tetrahydropapaverine to papaverine. We report the isolation and functional characterization of an opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) cDNA encoding DBOX, a flavoprotein oxidase with homology to (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase and the berberine bridge enzyme. A query of translated opium poppy stem transcriptome databases using berberine bridge enzyme yielded several candidate genes, including an (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase-like sequence selected for heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant enzyme preferentially catalyzed the oxidation of dihydrosanguinarine to sanguinarine but also converted (RS)-tetrahydropapaverine to papaverine and several protoberberine alkaloids to oxidized forms, including (RS)-canadine to berberine. The K(m) values of 201 and 146 μm for dihydrosanguinarine and the protoberberine alkaloid (S)-scoulerine, respectively, suggested high concentrations of these substrates in the plant.

Because galactose-binding lectins (galectins) have been implicated in these phenomena, we investigated whether galectins are involved in the β1-induced phenotype. We examined 9 galectins and, intriguingly, found that the expression of galectin-3 (Gal-3) is specifically induced by β1 but not by β3. Using β1-β3 chimeric integrins, we show that the induction of Gal-3 expression requires the hypervariable region in the extracellular domain of β1, but not its cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, Gal-3 expression does not depend on RhoA signaling, serum factors, or any of the major signal transduction pathways involving protein kinase C (PKC), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/-2 (ERK-1/2), phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3-K), or Src kinases. Instead, Gal-3 expression is controlled in an epigenetic manner. Whereas DNA methylation of the Lgals3 promoter maintains Gal-3 silencing in GE11 cells, expression of β1 causes its demethylation, leading to transcriptional activation of the Lgals3 gene. In turn, Gal-3 expression enhances β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN), as well as cell migration. Gal-3 also promotes β1-mediated cell adhesion to LN and Collagen-1 (Col)-1 in cells that endogenously express Gal-3 and β1 integrins.

https://openalex.org/W2074668610,"Background Biotic stress induced by various herbivores and pathogens invokes plant responses involving different defense mechanisms. However, we do not know whether different biotic stresses share a common response or which signaling pathways are involved in responses to different biotic stresses. We investigated the common and specific responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to three biotic stress agents: Spodoptera littoralis, Myzus persicae, and the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Methodology/Principal Findings We used electrophysiology to determine the plasma membrane potential (Vm) and we performed a gene microarray transcriptome analysis on Arabidopsis upon either herbivory or bacterial infection. Vm depolarization was induced by insect attack; however, the response was much more rapid to S. littoralis (30 min −2 h) than to M. persicae (4–6 h). M. persicae differentially regulated almost 10-fold more genes than by S. littoralis with an opposite regulation. M. persicae modulated genes involved in flavonoid, fatty acid, hormone, drug transport and chitin metabolism. S. littoralis regulated responses to heat, transcription and ion transport. The latest Vm depolarization (16 h) was found for P. syringae. The pathogen regulated responses to salicylate, jasmonate and to microorganisms. Despite this late response, the number of genes differentially regulated by P. syringae was closer to those regulated by S. littoralis than by M. persicae. Conclusions/Significance Arabidopsis plasma membranes respond with a Vm depolarization at times depending on the nature of biotic attack which allow setting a time point for comparative genome-wide analysis. A clear relationship between Vm depolarization and gene expression was found. At Vm depolarization timing, M. persicae regulates a wider array of Arabidopsis genes with a clear and distinct regulation than S. littoralis. An almost completely opposite regulation was observed between the aphid and the pathogen, with the former suppressing and the latter activating Arabidopsis defense responses."
https://openalex.org/W2027573843,"Hybrids often display increased size and growth, and thus are widely cultivated in agriculture and horticulture. Recent discoveries demonstrating the important regulatory roles of small RNAs have greatly improved our understanding of many basic biological questions, and could illuminate the molecular basis for the enhanced growth and size of hybrid plants. We profiled small RNAs by deep sequencing to characterize the inheritance patterns of small RNA levels in reciprocal hybrids of two Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, Columbia and Landsberg erecta. We find 24-nt siRNAs predominate among those small RNAs that are differentially expressed between the parents. Following hybridization, the transposable element (TE)-derived siRNAs are often inherited in an additive manner, whereas siRNAs associated with protein-coding genes are often down-regulated in hybrids to the levels observed for the parent with lower relative siRNA levels. Among the protein-coding genes that exhibit this pattern, genes that function in pathogen defense, abiotic stress tolerance, and secondary metabolism are significantly enriched. Small RNA clusters from protein-coding genes where a TE is present within one kilobase show a different predominant inheritance pattern (additive) from those that do not (low-parent dominance). Thus, down-regulation in the form of low-parent dominance is likely the default pattern of inheritance for genic siRNA, and a different inheritance mechanism for TE siRNA is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1992092413,"The plasma lipoprotein-associated apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and apoE have well described anti-inflammatory actions in the cardiovascular system, and mimetic peptides that retain these properties have been designed as therapeutics. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of apolipoprotein mimetics, however, are incompletely defined. Whether circulating apolipoproteins and their mimetics regulate innate immune responses at mucosal surfaces, sites where transvascular emigration of leukocytes is required during inflammation, remains unclear. Herein, we report that Apoai−/− and Apoe−/− mice display enhanced recruitment of neutrophils to the airspace in response to both inhaled lipopolysaccharide and direct airway inoculation with CXCL1. Conversely, treatment with apoA-I (L-4F) or apoE (COG1410) mimetic peptides reduces airway neutrophilia. We identify suppression of CXCR2-directed chemotaxis as a mechanism underlying the apolipoprotein effect. Pursuing the possibility that L-4F might suppress chemotaxis through heterologous desensitization, we confirmed that L-4F itself induces chemotaxis of human PMNs and monocytes. L-4F, however, fails to induce a calcium flux. Further exploring structure-function relationships, we studied the alternate apoA-I mimetic L-37pA, a bihelical analog of L-4F with two Leu-Phe substitutions. We find that L-37pA induces calcium and chemotaxis through formyl peptide receptor (FPR)2/ALX, whereas its D-stereoisomer (i.e. D-37pA) blocks L-37pA signaling and induces chemotaxis but not calcium flux through an unidentified receptor. Taken together, apolipoprotein mimetic peptides are novel chemotactic agents that possess complex structure-activity relationships to multiple receptors, displaying anti-inflammatory efficacy against innate immune responses in the airway.

In recent years, it has been increasingly recognized that high density lipoprotein (HDL), a multimolecular particle composed of apolipoproteins (e.g. apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apoE), lipids, and other cargo, has potent and wide ranging anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its well known function as a vehicle for cholesterol transport in the serum. HDL down-regulates adhesion molecules on endothelium and leukocytes, sequesters and reduces oxidized lipids, suppresses myeloid cell production in the bone marrow, and attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling by Toll-like receptors (1.Murphy A.J.

Many of these anti-inflammatory effects of HDL have been attributed to apoA-I, and in particular, to the 10 tandem amphipathic α-helices of apoA-I, a lipid-binding motif it shares with apoE and other apolipoproteins. Exploiting this discovery, several anti-inflammatory α-helical apoA-I mimetic peptides (e.g. the 18-amino acid peptide L-4F (3.Navab M. Shechter I. Anantharamaiah G.M. Reddy S.T. Van Lenten B.J.

Amphipathic α-helical apoE mimetic peptides (e.g. the 12-amino acid peptide COG1410 (6.Laskowitz D.T. Fillit H. Yeung N. Toku K. Vitek M.P. Apolipoprotein E-derived peptides reduce CNS inflammation. Implications for therapy of neurological disease.Acta Neurol. Scand Suppl. 2006; 185: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) have similarly been developed that display anti-inflammatory activity not only in the cardiovascular system, but also in the brain and other organs (6.Laskowitz D.T.

ApoA-I and apoE are expressed in the lung by structural (i.e. alveolar epithelial) and hematopoietic (e.g. alveolar macrophages) cells, and they and their mimetic peptides have recently been shown to regulate physiology and adaptive immunity of the airway. Thus, Apoai−/− mice have increased lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, whereas treatment with two apoA-I mimetics (L-4F or 5A) reduces inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in mouse models of asthma (7.Yao X.

Apoe−/− mice similarly develop exaggerated airway disease in an asthma model, and an apoE mimetic peptide rescues this response (9.Yao X. Fredriksson K. Yu Z.X. Xu X. Raghavachari N. Keeran K.J.

Studies on lung and other disease models have generally defined the anti-inflammatory effects of apolipoproteins on tissue-resident cells in various organs, as well as on effector functions of leukocytes. Whether apolipoproteins and their mimetics attenuate end-organ inflammation through the unifying mechanism of modulating leukocyte migration to tissues has not been defined. Herein, we report that Apoai−/− and Apoe−/− mice have enhanced recruitment of neutrophils (PMNs) 3The abbreviations used are: PMNneutrophilapoapolipoproteinfMLFformyl-Met-Leu-PheFPRformyl peptide receptorGPCRG protein-coupled receptorHDLhigh density lipoproteinAibamino isobutyric acidMIP-2macrophage inflammatory protein-2. and monocytes to the airspace in response to inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as enhanced airway neutrophilia in response to direct airway inoculation with CXCL1. Conversely, treatment with apoA-I (L-4F) and apoE (COG1410) mimetics reduces PMN/monocyte recruitment to the airway under these conditions. We identify suppression of chemokine-directed chemotaxis as a mechanism underlying the apolipoprotein effect. ApoA-I protein and L-4F suppress chemotaxis of murine PMNs to CXCL2; this is associated with reduced PMN surface display of CXCR2 in the case of L-4F. Pursuing the possibility that L-4F might suppress chemotaxis through heterologous desensitization (i.e. through itself acting as a chemoattractant), we confirmed that L-4F indeed induces chemotaxis of human PMNs and monocytes. L-4F, however, neither induces a calcium flux in PMNs or monocytes, nor induces chemotaxis through CXCR2, CCR2, formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 1, or FPR2/ALX in transfected HEK293 cells, making the identity of its receptor uncertain. Further exploring structure-function relationships, we studied an alternate apoA-I mimetic peptide, L-37pA, a bihelical version of L-4F with two Leu-Phe substitutions (10.Bocharov A.V. Baranova I.N.

Female mice (8–12 weeks old, weighing 15–22 g) were used in all experiments. Apoai−/− (B6.129P2-Apoa1tm1Unc/J), Apoe−/− (B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J) (both backcrossed 10 generations onto C57BL/6), and wild type C57BL/6 mice were all from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals after review by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NIEHS, National Institutes of Health. Mice were injected intravenously (150 μl in saline) with 20 mg/kg of L-4F or sc-4F peptide (control for L-4F), or with 1.2 mg/kg of COG1410 or 264 peptide (control for COG1410) 2 h prior to pulmonary exposures, similar to past reports (4.Dai L.

LPS exposure was by aerosol (300 μg/ml, 20 min) and KC exposure by intratracheal delivery (0.25 or 0.5 μg/60 μl by oropharyngeal aspiration), both as previously described (15.Smoak K. Madenspacher J.

Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from buffy coats (NIH Clinical Center, Transfusion Medicine Department, Bethesda, MD) enriched for mononuclear cells by using an iso-osmotic Percoll gradient, and neutrophils by dextran sedimentation of the buffy coat, both as previously described (16.Deng X.

The purity of the cell preparations was confirmed by morphology to be >90% for monocytes and >98% for neutrophils. Parental HEK293 cells were stably transfected with FPR1, FPR2/ALX, CCR2, or CXCR2 as previously described (16.Deng X. Ueda H. Su S.B. Gong W. Dunlop N.M. Gao J.L. Murphy P.M. Wang J.M.

All cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), and 800 μg/ml of geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). Bone marrow-isolated murine PMNs (1 × 106, 0.1 ml of RPMI, 1% FBS) were seeded into the upper chamber of a 96-well transwell system (polycarbonate membrane, 3.0 μm pore) (Corning, Corning, NY) after pretreatment (apoA-I, peptide (L-4F or sc-4F), or buffer control for 30 min), staining (2 μm calcein-AM, 30 min), and then washing in 1× in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Media (0.1 ml) with or without MIP-2 (50 ng/ml) was added to the lower chamber. Fluorescence was monitored in the lower chamber every 2 min in triplicate over a time course (34 min, 37 °C), using Gen5 software on a Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT), as previously described (15.Smoak K.

Immunol. 2008; 180: 3305-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Directional migration (i.e. chemotaxis) was derived at each time point by subtracting the fluorescence signal of nondirectionally migrating cells in control wells with no chemoattractant, and then normalizing this as a % of total cellular fluorescence by indexing it to labeled cells plated directly into the lower chamber (15.Smoak K.

Chemotaxis of human neutrophils, human monocytes, and transfected HEK293 cells in response to peptides, IL-8, and/or fMLF was measured using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber technique (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) system with 5-μm pore-sized polycarbonate membranes for the former two cell types, and 10-μm pore-sized membranes for receptor-transfected HEK293 cells, as previously described (17.Su S.B.

Med. 1999; 189: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). A 25-μl aliquot of chemoattractant diluted in chemotaxis medium (RPMI 1640, 1% BSA, 25 mm HEPES) was placed in the lower compartment, and 50 μl of cell suspension (106 cells/ml in chemotaxis medium) was placed in the upper compartment. The chamber was incubated (37 °C, humidified air with 5% CO2; 90 min for monocytes, 60 min for neutrophils, 240 min for HEK293 cells), after which the filter was removed, fixed, and stained with Diff-Quik (Harlew, Gibbstown, NJ). The number of migrated cells in three high-powered fields (×400) was counted by light microscopy after coding the samples. Results are obtained from triplicate samples and are representative of at least 5 experiments. Results are expressed as the chemotaxis index (mean ± S.D.), which represents the fold-increase in the number of migrated cells in response to chemoattractants over spontaneous cell migration (to control medium). Calcium mobilization of monocytes, neutrophils, and HEK293 cells was assayed by measuring fluorescence (LS-50B spectrometer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) of Fura-2-loaded cells, and calculating the ratio of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm (FL WinLab, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as previously reported (17.Su S.B.

Murine blood samples were analyzed using the HEMAVET 1700 hematology analyzer (Drew Scientific, Inc.). Manual WBC differential counts were reported and smear estimates were used to confirm values. Anti-CXCR2 (PerCP/Cy5.5), -Gr-1 (FITC), and isotype control antibodies were from Biolegend (San Diego, CA). Cells (peripheral blood or isolated bone marrow neutrophils) were stained and flow cytometry was performed using an LSR II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR) and FCS Express (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA) software. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism statistical software (San Diego, CA). Data are represented as mean ± S.E. Two-tailed Student's t test was applied for comparisons of two groups, and analysis of variance for analyses of three or more groups. For all tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant. ApoE and ApoA-I, major protein components of circulating HDL particles, have anti-inflammatory effects on several cell types in the cardiovascular system. Moreover, by binding LPS in the bloodstream and dampening systemic inflammation, intravenous apoA-I supplementation attenuates secondary injury in the lung and other peripheral organs during endotoxemia (4.Dai L.

However, the role of apolipoproteins in innate immunity of the airway and other mucosal surfaces, sites at which inflammatory responses to environmental stimuli require both local cellular responses and trans-tissue migration of circulating leukocytes, remains undefined. In an effort to define possible regulatory roles for apoA-I and apoE in the pulmonary innate immune response, we exposed Apoai−/− and Apoe−/− mice (and wild type controls) to inhaled LPS and then quantified PMN influx into the airspace, a well established, disease-relevant summary measure of the response to LPS in the lung (15.Smoak K.

As shown in panels A, C, and E of Figs. 1 and 2, both apolipoprotein-deficient strains recruited higher numbers of leukocytes to the airspace than WT controls. In addition to an increase in recruited PMNs, increased macrophage numbers were also observed in the airway 24 h post-LPS, consistent with increased recruitment of macrophage precursors (i.e. monocytes) to the alveolus.FIGURE 2.ApoA-I deficiency and supplementation with peptide have reciprocal effects on leukocyte trafficking to inflamed lung.

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs895819 is located at the terminal loop of pre-miR-27a. Here, we aimed to investigate whether SNP rs895819 was associated with the development of renal cell cancer (RCC) in a Chinese population.In this case-control study, we recruited 594 RCC patients and 600 cancer-free controls with frequency matched by age and sex. We genotyped this polymorphism using the TaqMan assay and assessed the effect of this polymorphism on RCC survival. Logistic regression model was used to assess the genetic effects on the development of RCC and interactions between rs895819 polymorphism and risk factors.Compared with AA homozygote, individuals carrying AG/GG genotypes had a statistically significant reduced susceptibility to RCC (adjusted OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.56-0.90). Furthermore, AG/GG genotypes were associated with reduced RCC susceptibility in localized clinical stage (adjusted OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.55-0.91), and similar effects were observed in well differentiated and poorly differentiated RCC (adjusted OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.55-0.93 for well differentiated, adjusted OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.28-0.93 for poorly differentiated). We also observed that rs895819 had multiplicative interactions with age and hypertension. However, the polymorphism did not influence the survival of RCC.Our results suggest that the pre-miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism can predict RCC risk in a Chinese population. Larger population-based prospective studies should be used to validate our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2119234483,"Mucoviscosity-associated gene A (magA) of Klebsiella pneumoniae contributes to K1 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis. Based on sequence homology and gene alignment, the magA gene has been predicted to encode a Wzy-type CPS polymerase. Sequence alignment with the Wzy_C and RfaL protein families (which catalyze CPS or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis) and topological analysis has suggested that eight highly conserved residues, including G308, G310, G334, G337, R290, P305, H323, and N324, were located in a hypothetical loop region. Therefore, we used site-directed mutagenesis to study the role of these residues in CPS production, and to observe the consequent phenotypes such as mucoviscosity, serum and phagocytosis resistance, and virulence (as assessed in mice) in pyogenic liver abscess strain NTUH-K2044. Alanine substitutions at R290 or H323 abolished all of these properties. The G308A mutant was severely impaired for these functions. The G334A mutant remained mucoid with decreased CPS production, but its virulence was significantly reduced in vivo. No phenotypic change was observed for strains harboring magA G310A, G337A, P305A, or N324A mutations. Therefore, R290, G308, H323, and G334 are functionally important residues of the MagA (Wzy) protein of K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044, capsular type K1. These amino acids are also likely to be important for the function of Wzy in other capsular types in K. pneumoniae and other species bearing Wzy_C family proteins."

However, most approaches utilized to generate bispecific antibodies yield antibody-like structures that diverge significantly from the structure of archetype human IgG, and those that do approach structural similarity to native antibodies are often challenging to engineer and manufacture. Here, we present a novel platform for the mammalian cell production of bispecific antibodies that differ from their parental mAbs by only a single point mutation per heavy chain. Central to this platform is the addition of a leucine zipper to the C terminus of the C(H)3 domain of the antibody that is sufficient to drive the heterodimeric assembly of antibody heavy chains and can be readily removed post-purification. Using this approach, we developed various antibody constructs including one-armed Abs, bispecific antibodies that utilize a common light chain, and bispecific antibodies that pair light chains to their cognate heavy chains via peptide tethers. We have applied this technology to various antibody pairings and will demonstrate the engineering, purification, and biological activity of these antibodies herein."
https://openalex.org/W1994909010,"Rhynchocephalians, the sister group of squamates (lizards and snakes), are only represented by the single genus Sphenodon today. This taxon is often considered to represent a very conservative lineage. However, rhynchocephalians were common during the late Triassic to latest Jurassic periods, but rapidly declined afterwards, which is generally attributed to their supposedly adaptive inferiority to squamates and/or Mesozoic mammals, which radiated at that time. New finds of Mesozoic rhynchocephalians can thus provide important new information on the evolutionary history of the group.A new fossil relative of Sphenodon from the latest Jurassic of southern Germany, Oenosaurus muehlheimensis gen. et sp. nov., presents a dentition that is unique amongst tetrapods. The dentition of this taxon consists of massive, continuously growing tooth plates, probably indicating a crushing dentition, thus representing a previously unknown trophic adaptation in rhynchocephalians.The evolution of the extraordinary dentition of Oenosaurus from the already highly specialized Zahnanlage generally present in derived rhynchocephalians demonstrates an unexpected evolutionary plasticity of these animals. Together with other lines of evidence, this seriously casts doubts on the assumption that rhynchocephalians are a conservative and adaptively inferior lineage. Furthermore, the new taxon underlines the high morphological and ecological diversity of rhynchocephalians in the latest Jurassic of Europe, just before the decline of this lineage on this continent. Thus, selection pressure by radiating squamates or Mesozoic mammals alone might not be sufficient to explain the demise of the clade in the Late Mesozoic, and climate change in the course of the fragmentation of the supercontinent of Pangaea might have played a major role."

Integration of cellulosomal components occurs through the binding of type I cohesin modules located in a non-catalytic molecular scaffold to type I dockerin modules located at the C terminus of cellulosomal enzymes. The majority of type I dockerins display internal symmetry reflected by the presence of two essentially identical cohesin-binding surfaces. Here we report the crystal structures of two novel Clostridium thermocellum type I cohesin-dockerin complexes (CohOlpC-Doc124A and CohOlpA-Doc918). The data revealed that the two dockerins, Doc918 and Doc124A, are unusual because they lack the structural symmetry required to support a dual binding mode. Thus, in both cases, cohesin recognition is dominated by residues located at positions 11, 12, and 19 of one of the dockerin binding surfaces. The alternative binding mode is not possible (Doc918) or highly limited (Doc124A) because residues that assume the critical interacting positions, when dockerins are reoriented by 180°, make steric clashes with the cohesin. In common with a third dockerin (Doc258) that also presents a single binding mode, Doc124A directs the appended cellulase, Cel124A, to the surface of C. thermocellum and not to cellulosomes because it binds preferentially to type I cohesins located at the cell envelope.

Here we derive high-resolution structural models of the mechanical intermediate states of stretched GFP using steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. These structures were used to produce mutants of EGFP and EYFP that mimic GFP's different mechanical intermediates. A spectroscopic analysis revealed that a population of EGFP molecules with a missing N-terminal α-helix was significantly dimmed, while the fluorescence lifetime characteristic of the anionic chromophore state remained unaffected. This suggests a mechanism how N-terminal deletions can switch the protonation state of the chromophore, and how the fluorescence of GFP molecules in response to mechanical disturbance might be turned off."
https://openalex.org/W2028085394,"The brain is one of the major targets of chronic alcohol abuse. Yet the fundamental mechanisms underlying alcohol-mediated brain damage remain unclear. The products of alcohol metabolism cause DNA damage, which in conditions of DNA repair dysfunction leads to genomic instability and neural death. We propose that one-carbon metabolism (OCM) impairment associated with long term chronic ethanol intake is a key factor in ethanol-induced neurotoxicity, because OCM provides cells with DNA precursors for DNA repair and methyl groups for DNA methylation, both critical for genomic stability. Using histological (immunohistochemistry and stereological counting) and biochemical assays, we show that 3-week chronic exposure of adult mice to 5% ethanol (Lieber-Decarli diet) results in increased DNA damage, reduced DNA repair, and neuronal death in the brain. These were concomitant with compromised OCM, as evidenced by elevated homocysteine, a marker of OCM dysfunction. We conclude that OCM dysfunction plays a causal role in alcohol-induced genomic instability in the brain because OCM status determines the alcohol effect on DNA damage/repair and genomic stability. Short ethanol exposure, which did not disturb OCM, also did not affect the response to DNA damage, whereas additional OCM disturbance induced by deficiency in a key OCM enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) in Mthfr+/− mice, exaggerated the ethanol effect on DNA repair. Thus, the impact of long term ethanol exposure on DNA repair and genomic stability in the brain results from OCM dysfunction, and MTHFR mutations such as Mthfr 677C→T, common in human population, may exaggerate the adverse effects of ethanol on the brain.

Nearly 100 million people worldwide have alcohol use disorders. Brain damage is a common and potentially severe consequence of alcohol abuse (1.Harper C. The neuropathology of alcohol-related brain damage.Alcohol Alcohol. 2009; 44: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is estimated that 50–75% of long term alcoholics exhibit cognitive impairment and structural damage to the brain. It is also known that chronic alcohol abuse is associated with cerebral cortical atrophy (1.Harper C. The neuropathology of alcohol-related brain damage.Alcohol Alcohol. 2009; 44: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Neuropathological analyses have provided evidence for loss of neurons in certain brain regions such as frontal lobes, which are highly affected in the alcoholic brain (1.Harper C.

This region is essential for executive functions, whose loss may lead to a progressive loss of these functions, as seen in people addicted to alcohol as well as in individuals with frontal cortical damage (2.Crews F.T.

According to the generally accepted mechanism, endogenous DNA damage is constantly being produced in normal conditions but is also repaired, resulting in a low steady-state level of damage compatible with normal cellular function. However, under conditions of DNA repair deficiency, endogenous damage is not repaired and therefore accumulates over time causing unscheduled alterations within the genome or genomic instability, which can involve simple DNA base changes that occur due to defects in the DNA repair (10.Martin S.A. Hewish M. Lord C.J. Ashworth A. Genomic instability and the selection of treatments for cancer.J. Pathol. 2010; 220: 281-289PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Jeppesen D.K. Bohr V.A. Stevnsner T.

Genomic instability-an evolving hallmark of cancer.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). The latter is the major form of genomic instability in cancers and is predominantly accepted as one of the most important factors of carcinogenesis (10.Martin S.A. Hewish M. Lord C.J. Ashworth A.

Genomic instability-an evolving hallmark of cancer.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Another major clinical feature of DNA repair deficiency is neurological disease, and accordingly, DNA repair deficiencies are implicated in various diseases that feature progressive neurodegeneration, such as Werner syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, and ataxia-oculomotor apraxia-1 (11.Jeppesen D.K. Bohr V.A. Stevnsner T. DNA repair deficiency in neurodegeneration.Prog. Neurobiol. 2011; 94: 166-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). An emerging mechanism for how aberrant DNA repair and persistent DNA damage may affect cell viability of postmitotic neurons is via impairment in transcription (14.Brooks P.J. Cheng T.F. Cooper L. Do all of the neurologic diseases in patients with DNA repair gene mutations result from the accumulation of DNA damage?.DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 834-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, ethanol-induced DNA damage, if not repaired, may also lead to genomic instability and its consequences, carcinogenesis and neurodegeneration. Indeed, chronic alcoholism is associated with both carcinogenesis and brain damage (1.Harper C. The neuropathology of alcohol-related brain damage.Alcohol Alcohol. 2009; 44: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 6.Seitz H.K. Stickel F. Molecular mechanisms of alcohol-mediated carcinogenesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). What can compromise DNA repair in conditions of chronic long term ethanol exposure? The impairment of OCM can play such a role. It is known that long term alcohol exposure is associated with OCM dysfunction and the suppression of OCM reactions. Elevated Hcy, an indication of OCM dysfunction (15.Stover P.J. One-carbon metabolism-genome interactions in folate-associated pathologies.J. Nutr. 2009; 139: 2402-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16.Fenech M. Folate, DNA damage, and the aging brain.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2010; 131: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), is often observed in patients with chronic alcoholism (6.Seitz H.K. Stickel F.

New perspectives on folate transport in relation to alcoholism-induced folate malabsorption-association with epigenome stability and cancer development.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2175-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). OCM is critical for maintaining genomic stability (16.Fenech M. Folate, DNA damage, and the aging brain.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2010; 131: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), because OCM reactions are involved in the biosynthesis of DNA nucleotides (dNTPs), precursors for DNA repair, and producing S-adenosylmethionine involved in DNA methylation (15.Stover P.J. One-carbon metabolism-genome interactions in folate-associated pathologies.J. Nutr. 2009; 139: 2402-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16.Fenech M. Folate, DNA damage, and the aging brain.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2010; 131: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Chronic alcohol consumption has long been associated with an increased risk of a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (18.McKillop I.H. Schrum L.W. Role of alcohol in liver carcinogenesis.Semin. Liver Dis. 2009; 29: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19.Benassi-Evans B. Fenech M. Chronic alcohol exposure induces genome damage measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay and aneuploidy in human B lymphoblastoid cell lines.Mutagenesis. 2011; 26: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrates that alcohol cancer initiation is caused by genomic instability (19.Benassi-Evans B. Fenech M. Chronic alcohol exposure induces genome damage measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay and aneuploidy in human B lymphoblastoid cell lines.Mutagenesis. 2011; 26: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which may be a result of OCM impairment (16.Fenech M.

However, it is not known whether these factors play a role in alcohol-induced neurodegeneration. Here, we report that long term ethanol intake increased DNA damage, compromised DNA repair, and induced neuron death in the cerebral cortex of adult mice. These were concomitant with compromised OCM, as evidenced by elevated Hcy and global DNA hypomethylation. We show a causal role of OCM impairment in long term ethanol-induced DNA repair dysfunction and ensuing genomic instability by demonstrating how modulation of OCM status affects DNA repair in the neurons of cerebral cortex in alcohol-exposed mice. A short ethanol exposure, which did not disturb OCM, also induced a normal reaction to DNA damage and activation of DNA damage repair. These mice were characterized by lower levels of DNA damage and neuronal death in the brain, compared with those after long term ethanol exposure. In contrast, additional OCM impairment caused by deficiency in essential the OCM enzyme, MTHFR in Mthfr+/− mice, exaggerated the effect of long term ethanol exposure on DNA repair. Our findings are the first demonstration of alcohol-induced genomic instability mediated by OCM impairment in the brain. All experiments were approved by the IACUC at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. 10–12-Week-old C57BL/6 male mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were fed ad libitum a nutritionally adequate Lieber-Decarli liquid diet containing 5% (v/v) ethanol or a control diet in which ethanol was substituted isocalorically with dextrin maltose (BioServ).

Chem. 2003; 75: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). [2H4]Hcy stock solution was prepared as described (21.Nelson B.C. Pfeiffer C.M. Sniegoski L.T. Satterfield M.B. Development and evaluation of an isotope dilution LC/MS method for the determination of total homocysteine in human plasma.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and serial dilutions of the solution were used to prepare the samples for the calibration curves. The quantification of Hcy was accomplished using area ratios calculated using [2H4]Hcy as the internal standard, where the concentration of the internal standard was set at 2000 ng/ml. For the plasma samples, 5 μl of 20 μg/ml of [2H4]Hcy and 15 μl of water was added to 30 μl of plasma samples, and Hcy was separated using an Eclipse XDB-C18 guard column (4.6 × 12.5 mm) and an analytical column (150 × 4.6 mm inner diameter, 5 μm, Zorbax C18 Agilent). The mobile phase consisted of water with 0.5% formic acid (A) and methanol (B). An isocratic gradient was run at 60% B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (10 min/sample). Mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay was performed using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API 4000 system) equipped with Turbo Ion Spray® (Applied Biosystems). The data were acquired and analyzed using Analyst Version 1.4.2 (Applied Biosystems). Positive electrospray ionization data were acquired using multiple reactions monitoring. The Turbo Ion Spray® instrumental source settings for temperature (curtain gas, ion source gas 1, ion source gas 2, and ion spray voltage) were 200 °C, 10, 60, and 60 p.s.i., and 5500 V. The Turbo Ion Spray® compound parameter settings for declustering potential, entrance potential, and collision cell exit potential were 30, 10, and 12 V, respectively. The collision energy setting was 20 V. Hcy and [2H4]Hcy were characterized using the multiple reactions monitoring ion transitions 136.1–90 and 140.0–94, respectively. Hcy was extracted as follows: 1 ml of solid phase extraction cartridges (Oasis MCX, Waters Corp.) were preconditioned with 1 ml of methanol, followed by 1 ml of water. The plasma samples were added and washed with 1 ml of 1% formic acid and 1 ml of methanol, and the compounds were eluted with 1 ml of 5% ammonium hydroxide. The eluate was stream-dried under nitrogen at 60 °C, reconstituted in 100 μl of methanol, and then transferred to the autosampler vial for analysis. DNA hydrolysis, sample enrichment, and purification were carried out as reported (22.Balbo S. Hashibe M. Gundy S. Brennan P. Canova C. Simonato L. Merletti F. Richiardi L. Agudo A. Castellsagué X. Znaor A. Talamini R. Bencko V. Holcátová I. Wang M. Hecht S.S. Boffetta P. N-2-Ethyldeoxyguanosine as a potential biomarker for assessing effects of alcohol consumption on DNA.Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2008; 17: 3026-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA was dissolved in 400 μl of 10 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2 buffer containing N2-[15N5]ethyl-dG (50 fmol) and NaBH3CN (30 mg) to convert N2-ethylidene-dG to N2-ethyl-dG (7.Wang M. Yu N. Chen L. Villalta P.W. Hochalter J.B. Hecht S.S. Identification of an acetaldehyde adduct in human liver DNA and quantitation as N2-ethyldeoxyguanosine.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The DNA was digested overnight at room temperature with 1300 units of DNase I, and then 1300 additional units of DNase I, 0.07 units of phosphodiesterase I (type II, from Crotalus adamanteus venom), and 750 units of alkaline phosphatase were added to the resulting mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 70 min and then overnight at room temperature. Enzymes were removed by using an MPS device (30 kDa, Amicon). After removal of an aliquot for dG analysis, the hydrolysate was desalted and purified using a solid-phase extraction (Strata-X 33 μm; 30 mg/1 ml, Phenomenex). The 70% CH3OH fraction was collected, evaporated, dissolved in 300 μl of H2O, and purified by anion exchange reversed phase extraction (Oasis MAX, 30 mg/cartridge, Waters). Adducts were eluted with 500 μl/ml of 70% CH3OH. After evaporation, the sample was dissolved in 20 μl of H2O, and aliquots were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Samples from each dose were processed together as a set (three sets/subject). Buffer blanks containing internal standard were analyzed for MS instrument base line and contamination. Calf thymus DNA (0.1 mg) with internal standard was used as a positive control. dG was quantified with an Agilent 1100 capillary flow HPLC with a diode array UV detector (Agilent Technologies, 254 nm). A 4.6-mm × 25-cm Luna 5-μm C18 column (Phenomenex) was used with a gradient from 5 to 40% CH3OH in H2O (35 min, 10 μl/min). LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 1100 capillary flow HPLC (Agilent Technologies) with a 250-mm × 0.5-mm 5-μm particle size Polar RP column (Phenomenex) and a Vantage (ThermoElectron) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The solvent elution program was a 10 μl/min gradient from 5 to 40% CH3OH in 35 min at 30 °C. The ESI source was set in the positive ion mode as follows: voltage, 3.7 kV; current, 3 μA; and heated ion transfer tube, 275 °C. The collision energy was 12 eV, and the argon collision gas pressure was 1.0 millitorr. Adducts were quantified by MS/MS with selected reaction monitoring at m/z 296 → m/z 180 ([M + H]+→[BH]+) for N2-ethyl-dG and at the corresponding transition m/z 301→m/z 185 for N2-[15N5]ethyl-dG. A calibration curve was used for each analysis (standard solution: a mixture 0.1, 0.5, 4, 10, or 100 fmol of N2-ethyl-dG and 5 fmol of [15N5]N2-ethyl-dG). Brains were collected, fixed in Bouin's fixative, embedded in gelatin blocks, and serially sectioned in coronal planes at 25 μm by Neuroscience Associates, Inc. Before incubation with primary antibody, sections were subjected to antigen retrieval (ProHisto, 15 min) Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in 100% methanol. The sections were then incubated with the primary antibody (overnight at 4 °C). Antibodies used were as follows: AIF (1:500; Abcam ab32516); active caspase 3 (1:500; R&D Systems AF835); oxo8dG (1:100; Abcam; ab64548), PAR (1:100; Enzo Life Sciences; BML-SA216), and MAP-2 (1:500; Millipore; AB5622). Then sections were incubated with ImmPRESSTM reagent (Vector Laboratories; rabbit MP7401 and mouse MP7402) for 30 min, incubated with DAB ImmPACTTM (Vector Laboratories; SK4105) in combination with 1.5% NiCl (10 min), and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Electron Microscopy Services). For stereological assay, one set of slides was incubated with oxo8dG (1:100; Abcam; ab64548) overnight at 4 °C. Then sections were incubated with ImmPRESSTM mouse reagent (Vector Laboratories; MP7402, 30 min) and developed as above. A second set was stained for TUNEL using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science; 11 684 795 910). The sections were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. A positive control was performed by incubating with DNase I (Invitrogen; 18047-019) prior to labeling; a negative control was performed by incubating the slides with the TUNEL label in the absence of the enzyme. Labeling was performed by incubating sections with a 1:10 ratio of enzyme to label solution (1 h, 37 °C). The signal was converted to a peroxidase using a POD kit (Roche Applied Science; 11426346910, 30 min, 37 °C), and then sections were developed as described above. Both sets of slides were blocked again with 10% horse serum (20 min), and MAP2 (1:500; Millipore; AB5622) was applied either for 2 h (oxo8dG subset) or overnight at 4 °C (TUNEL subset). Sections were then developed (see above) and counterstained with Methyl Green (Vector Laboratories; H3402) for oxo8dG subset or Mayer's hematoxylin (Electron Microscopy Services, 26043) for TUNEL subset. Stereological counting was performed using the CAST-GRID software (Olympus DK). An Olympus BX51 microscope with a motorized stage (x, y), attached microcator (z axis, Heidenhain), and color camera (Hitachi HV-C20) was used. Both the optical dissector and fractionator methods were employed to compare the two estimates of total cell number and relative efficiency. Cavalieri's principle was used to determine cerebral cortex volume (Vref, 23.Gundersen H.J. Bendtsen T.F. Korbo L. Marcussen N. Møller A. Nielsen K. Nyengaard J.R. Pakkenberg B. Sørensen F.B. Vesterby A. Some new, simple, and efficient stereological methods and their use in pathological research and diagnosis.APMIS. 1988; 96: 379-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (2676) Google Scholar). The density (Nv) of total labeled neurons, positive for oxo8dG or TUNEL, was established using the optical dissector method: Nv = ΣQ−/Vdis·ΣPi, whereby ΣQ− is the total number of cells counted; Vdis is the counting frame area multiplied by the height of the optical dissector, and ΣPi is the total number of stops within the reference volume counted. For each cortex, a random systematic sampling of every 12th section was analyzed (20 and 22 sections/animal). All counting was done with an oil immersion ×60 objective. For confocal microscopy analysis, brains were collected, rapidly fresh frozen, and serially cryosectioned in the coronal plane at 10 μm. Sections from prefrontal cerebral cortex were analyzed in fluorescence experiments. Before incubation with primary antibody, sections were briefly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then subjected to antigen retrieval (ProHisto, 15 min). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in 100% methanol. The sections were then incubated with the primary antibody (overnight, 4 °C). Antibodies used were as follows: AIF (1:500; Abcam ab32516); active caspase 3 (1:500; R&D Systems AF835); and PAR (1:100; Enzo Life Sciences; BML-SA216).

A positive control was performed by incubating with DNase I (Invitrogen; 18047-019) prior to labeling; a negative control was performed by incubating the slides with the TUNEL label in the absence of the enzyme. Labeling was performed by incubating sections with a 1:10 ratio of enzyme to label solution (1 h, 37 °C). Primary antibody was then labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 1:2000 for 1 h (mouse A21238 or rabbit A21245, Invitrogen). Sections were incubated with NeuN conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (1:100; Millipore MAB377A5). Hoechst was applied to visualize cell nuclei, and sections were coverslipped using Prolong Gold antifade (Invitrogen P36930). Confocal imaging was performed using a Nikon T1-E microscope with A1 confocal and equipped with a high temporal and spatial resolution EMCCD camera. All imaging settings were kept consistent across controls and ethanol-exposed groups. DNA repair activity was analyzed using real time qPCR, as described previously (24.Zhang H. Zang Y. Sun Y. Jin R. Wu H. Wang M. Li N. Chen D. A new approach utilizing real-time qPCR to detect in vitro base excision repair.DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were isolated from brain tissue using the kit from Active Motif, and total protein content was quantified by the Bradford assay. Samples containing 24 μg of total protein were incubated for 30 min at 32 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 2 pmol of DNA template A containing single nucleotide deletion, 2 pmol of endogenous control DNA template B (Table 1), 45 mm HEPES-KOH, 70 mm KCl, 7.4 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm DTT, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 20 μl each of dATP, dTTP, cCTP, and dGTP, 40 mm phosphocreatine, 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 20 μg/ml BSA, 3.4% glycerol, 2 mm NAD+, and 4 μg of poly(dI/dC). The reaction was terminated by heating (72 °C, 10 min). The probes and primers were designed as described (24.Zhang H. Zang Y. Sun Y. Jin R. Wu H. Wang M. Li N. Chen D. A new approach utilizing real-time qPCR to detect in vitro base excision repair.DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and synthesized by Gene Link. Two μl of a ×10,000 dilution of the reaction mixture was used as the template for qPCR with final concentrations of 200 nm forward and 200 nm reverse primers and 300 nm of either probes 1 or 2 followed by qPCR monoplex reactions with annealing temperature of 60 °C for 40 cycles. The quantity of repaired templates was calculated by comparing the ΔCt values (Ct is the number of cycles required for the fluorescent 5 signal to cross the threshold) of the repaired and control templates.TABLE 1Templates for qPCR-based BER activity assay Global methylation of DNA isolated from brain tissue (DNA isolation kit, Qiagen) was determined by the methylation quantification assay based on measuring levels of 5-methylcytosine by ELISA (Epigenetek). Statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel, and p values were obtained using analysis of variance and Fisher's post hoc test. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. We first set out to identify whether a 3-week exposure to the Lieber-Decarli liquid diet containing 5% ethanol causes neuron death in the brains of the C57BL/6 mice.

https://openalex.org/W2124233787,"Background Baboons receiving xenogeneic livers from wild type and transgenic pigs survive less than 10 days. One of the major issues is the early development of profound thrombocytopenia that results in fatal hemorrhage. Histological examination of xenotransplanted livers has shown baboon platelet activation, phagocytosis and sequestration within the sinusoids. In order to study the mechanisms of platelet consumption in liver xenotransplantation, we have developed an in vitro system to examine the interaction between pig endothelial cells with baboon platelets and to thereby identify molecular mechanisms and therapies. Methods Fresh pig hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal and aortic endothelial cells were isolated by collagenase digestion of livers and processing of aortae from GTKO and Gal+ MGH-miniature swine. These primary cell cultures were then tested for the differential ability to induce baboon or pig platelet aggregation. Phagocytosis was evaluated by direct observation of CFSE labeled-platelets, which are incubated with endothelial cells under confocal light microscopy. Aurintricarboxylic acid (GpIb antagonist blocking interactions with von Willebrand factor/vWF), eptifibatide (Gp IIb/IIIa antagonist), and anti-Mac-1 Ab (anti-αMβ2 integrin Ab) were tested for the ability to inhibit phagocytosis. Results None of the pig cells induced aggregation or phagocytosis of porcine platelets. However, pig hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal and aortic endothelial cells (GTKO and Gal+) all induced moderate aggregation of baboon platelets. Importantly, pig liver sinusoidal endothelial cells efficiently phagocytosed baboon platelets, while pig aortic endothelial cells and hepatocytes had minimal effects on platelet numbers. Anti-MAC-1 Ab, aurintricarboxylic acid or eptifibatide, significantly decreased baboon platelet phagocytosis by pig liver endothelial cells (P<0.01). Conclusions Although pig hepatocytes and aortic endothelial cells directly caused aggregation of baboon platelets, only pig liver endothelial cells efficiently phagocytosed baboon platelets. Blocking vWF and integrin adhesion pathways prevented both aggregation and phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1969282725,"Gene expression data is often assumed to be normally-distributed, but this assumption has not been tested rigorously. We investigate the distribution of expression data in human cancer genomes and study the implications of deviations from the normal distribution for translational molecular oncology research.We conducted a central moments analysis of five cancer genomes and performed empiric distribution fitting to examine the true distribution of expression data both on the complete-experiment and on the individual-gene levels. We used a variety of parametric and nonparametric methods to test the effects of deviations from normality on gene calling, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification using a sixth cancer genome.Central moments analyses reveal statistically-significant deviations from normality in all of the analyzed cancer genomes. We observe as much as 37% variability in gene calling, 39% variability in functional annotation, and 30% variability in prospective, molecular tumor subclassification associated with this effect.Cancer gene expression profiles are not normally-distributed, either on the complete-experiment or on the individual-gene level. Instead, they exhibit complex, heavy-tailed distributions characterized by statistically-significant skewness and kurtosis. The non-Gaussian distribution of this data affects identification of differentially-expressed genes, functional annotation, and prospective molecular classification. These effects may be reduced in some circumstances, although not completely eliminated, by using nonparametric analytics. This analysis highlights two unreliable assumptions of translational cancer gene expression analysis: that ""small"" departures from normality in the expression data distributions are analytically-insignificant and that ""robust"" gene-calling algorithms can fully compensate for these effects."

It is unclear how these activities are coordinated, and the impact of AIF upon human disease, in particular cancer, is not well documented. In this study we have explored the contribution of AIF to the progression of prostate cancer. Analysis of archival gene expression data demonstrated that AIF transcript levels are elevated in human prostate cancer, and we found that AIF protein is increased in prostate tumors. Suppression of AIF expression in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 demonstrated that AIF does not contribute to cell toxicity via a variety of chemical death triggers, and growth under nutrient-rich conditions is largely unaffected by AIF ablation. However, under growth stress conditions, AIF depletion from DU145 and PC3 cell lines led to significant reductions in cell survival and growth that were not observed in LNCaP cells. Moreover AIF-deficient PC3 cells exhibited substantial reduction of tumorigenic growth in vivo. This reduced survival correlated with decreased expression of mitochondrial complex I protein subunits and concomitant changes in glucose metabolism. Finally, restoration of AIF-deficient PC3 cells with AIF variants demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of AIF is required for aggressive growth. Overall these studies show that AIF is an important factor for advanced prostate cancer cells and that through control of energy metabolism and redox balance, the enzymatic activity of AIF is critical for this support.

https://openalex.org/W2013855391,"To determine the cytokine production profile of cultured salivary gland epithelial (SGE) cells obtained from patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS).SGE cells obtained from 9 SS patients and 6 normal controls were cultured in the presence of exogenous IFNγ. Cell proliferation and apoptosis in response to IFNγ were determined by WST1 assay and by FACS analysis. The concentrations of IL-6 and TGFβ secreted into culture supernatants were analyzed by ELISA.IFNγ did not significantly affect the proliferation or apoptosis of SGE cells. However, IL-6 concentrations were higher, and TGFβ concentrations were lower, in culture supernatants of SGE cells from SS patients than from normal controls.Cytokine production by SGE cells from SS patients showed a skewed balance compared with normal controls, with increased IL-6 and decreased TGFβ secretion. This imbalance may be critical in the regulation of Treg/Th17 cells and may foster a pathogenic milieu that may be causative and predictive in SS."
https://openalex.org/W2015601389,"In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of human-initiated cascading failures in three critical inter-dependent societal infrastructures due to behavioral adaptations in response to a crisis. We focus on three closely coupled socio-technical networks here: (i) cellular and mesh networks, (ii) transportation networks and (iii) mobile call networks. In crises, changes in individual behaviors lead to altered travel, activity and calling patterns, which influence the transport network and the loads on wireless networks. The interaction between these systems and their co-evolution poses significant technical challenges for representing and reasoning about these systems. In contrast to system dynamics models for studying these interacting infrastructures, we develop interaction-based models in which individuals and infrastructure elements are represented in detail and are placed in a common geographic coordinate system. Using the detailed representation, we study the impact of a chemical plume that has been released in a densely populated urban region. Authorities order evacuation of the affected area, and this leads to individual behavioral adaptation wherein individuals drop their scheduled activities and drive to home or pre-specified evacuation shelters as appropriate. They also revise their calling behavior to communicate and coordinate among family members. These two behavioral adaptations cause flash-congestion in the urban transport network and the wireless network. The problem is exacerbated with a few, already occurring, road closures. We analyze how extended periods of unanticipated road congestion can result in failure of infrastructures, starting with the servicing base stations in the congested area. A sensitivity analysis on the compliance rate of evacuees shows non-intuitive effect on the spatial distribution of people and on the loading of the base stations. For example, an evacuation compliance rate of 70% results in higher number of overloaded base stations than the evacuation compliance rate of 90%."
https://openalex.org/W2073009931,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are heterogeneous populations of cells that participate in vasculogenesis and promote tissue regeneration. However the different roles of EPC populations in vasculogenesis and tissue regeneration, as well as their regulation and mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, we cultured bone marrow (BM)-derived early EPCs (EEPCs) and endothelial outgrowth cells (EOCs), and investigated their roles in liver regeneration and their regulation by the Notch signaling pathway. We found that Notch signaling exhibited different effects on the proliferation and migration of EEPCs and EOCs. Our results also showed that while EEPCs failed to form vessel-like structures in a three dimensional sprouting model in vitro, EOCs could sprout and form endothelial cords, and this was regulated by the Notch signaling. We further showed that, by using a conditional knockout model of RBP-J (the critical transcription factor mediating Notch signaling), Notch signaling differentially regulates EEPCs and EOCs. In a partial hepatectomy (PHx) model, EEPCs Notch-dependently benefitted liver regeneration with respect to liver function and hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. In contrast, EOCs appeared not directly involved in the recovery of liver function and the increase of hepatocytes. These data suggested that the RBP-J-mediated Notch signaling differentially regulated the two types of EPCs, which showed different roles in liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2079160540,"It becomes increasingly evident that nuclesomes are far from being identical to each other. This nucleosome diversity is due partially to the existence of histone variants encoded by separate genes. Among the known histone variants the less characterized are H2A.Bbd and different forms of macroH2A. This is especially true in the case of H2A.Bbd as there are still no commercially available antibodies specific to H2A.Bbd that can be used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).We have generated HeLa S3 cell lines stably expressing epitope-tagged versions of macroH2A1.1, H2A.Bbd or canonical H2A and analyzed genomic distribution of the tagged histones using ChIP-on-chip technique.The presence of histone H2A variants macroH2A1.1 and H2A.Bbd has been analyzed in the chromatin of several segments of human chromosomes 11, 16 and X that have been chosen for their different gene densities and chromatin status. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by hybridization with custom NimbleGene genomic microarrays demonstrated that in open chromatin domains containing tissue-specific along with housekeeping genes, the H2A.Bbd variant was preferentially associated with the body of a subset of transcribed genes. The macroH2A1.1 variant was virtually absent from some genes and underrepresented in others. In contrast, in closed chromatin domains which contain only tissue-specific genes inactive in HeLa S3 cells, both macroH2A1.1 and H2A.Bbd histone variants were present and often colocalized.Genomic distribution of macro H2A and H2A.Bbd does not follow any simple rule and is drastically different in open and closed genomic domains."
https://openalex.org/W2024696540,"Objective There is a need to improve treatment for individuals with bulimic disorders. It was hypothesised that a focus in treatment on broader emotional and social/interpersonal issues underlying eating disorders would increase treatment efficacy. This study tested a novel treatment based on the above hypothesis, an Emotional and Social Mind Training Group (ESM), against a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Group (CBT) treatment. Method 74 participants were randomised to either ESM or CBT Group treatment programmes. All participants were offered 13 group and 4 individual sessions. The primary outcome measure was the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) Global score. Assessments were carried out at baseline, end of treatment (four months) and follow-up (six months). Results There were no differences in outcome between the two treatments. No moderators of treatment outcome were identified. Adherence rates were higher for participants in the ESM group. Discussion This suggests that ESM may be a viable alternative to CBT for some individuals. Further research will be required to identify and preferentially allocate suitable individuals accordingly.

https://openalex.org/W2060586170,"The discrimination and taxonomic identification of marine species continues to pose a challenge despite the growing number of diagnostic metrics and approaches. This study examined the genetic relationship between two sibling species of the genus Calanus (Crustacea; Copepoda; Calanidae), C. agulhensis and C. sinicus, using a multi-gene analysis. DNA sequences were determined for portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (mtCOI); nuclear citrate synthase (CS), and large subunit (28S) rRNA genes for specimens collected from the Sea of Japan and North East (NE) Pacific Ocean for C. sinicus and from the Benguela Current and Agulhas Bank, off South Africa, for C. agulhensis. For mtCOI, C. sinicus and C. agulhensis showed similar levels of haplotype diversity (H(d) = 0.695 and 0.660, respectively) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively). Pairwise F(ST) distances for mtCOI were significant only between C. agulhensis collected from the Agulhas and two C. sinicus populations: the Sea of Japan (F(ST) = 0.152, p<0.01) and NE Pacific (F(ST) = 0.228, p<0.005). Between the species, F(ST) distances were low for both mtCOI (F(ST) = 0.083, p = 0.003) and CS (F(ST) = 0.050, p = 0.021). Large subunit (28S) rRNA showed no variation between the species. Our results provide evidence of the lack of genetic distinction of C. sinicus and C. agulhensis, raise questions of whether C. agulhensis warrants status as a distinct species, and indicate the clear need for more intensive and extensive ecological and genetic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2064127641,"Transposable elements, as major components of most eukaryotic organisms' genomes, define their structural organization and plasticity. They supply host genomes with functional elements, for example, binding sites of the pleiotropic master transcription factor p53 were identified in LINE1, Alu and LTR repeats in the human genome. Similarly, in this report we reveal the role of zebrafish (Danio rerio) EnSpmN6_DR non-autonomous DNA transposon in shaping the repertoire of the p53 target genes. The multiple copies of EnSpmN6_DR and their embedded p53 responsive elements drive in several instances p53-dependent transcriptional modulation of the adjacent gene, whose human orthologs were frequently previously annotated as p53 targets. These transposons define predominantly a set of target genes whose human orthologs contribute to neuronal morphogenesis, axonogenesis, synaptic transmission and the regulation of programmed cell death. Consistent with these biological functions the orthologs of the EnSpmN6_DR-colonized loci are enriched for genes expressed in the amygdala, the hippocampus and the brain cortex. Our data pinpoint a remarkable example of convergent evolution: the exaptation of lineage-specific transposons to shape p53-regulated neuronal morphogenesis-related pathways in both a hominid and a teleost fish."

Design Eighteen patients with mRCC and twelve volunteers (controls) were available for analysis. TREG phenotype was examined using flow cytometry (FCM). TREG were also quantified by analyzing the epigenetic status of the FOXP3 locus using methylation specific PCR. As a third approach, RNA of the PBL was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays and the gene signatures were explored using pathway analysis. Results We observed higher numbers of TREG in pre-treatment PBL of mRCC patients compared to controls. A significant increase in TREG was detected in all mRCC patients after the two cycles of immunotherapy. The expansion of TREG was significantly higher in non-responders than in responding patients. Methylation specific PCR confirmed the FCM data and circumvented the variability and subjectivity of the FCM method. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the microarray data showed significant enrichment of FOXP3 target genes, CTLA-4 and TGF-ß associated pathways in the patient cohort. Conclusion Immune monitoring of the peripheral blood and tumor tissue is important for a wide range of diseases and treatment strategies. Adoption of methodology for quantifying TREG with the least variability and subjectivity will enhance the ability to compare and interpret findings across studies."

To better resolve the spatial organization of the DHPR subunits (α1s or CaV1.1, α2, β1a, δ1, and γ), we created transgenic mice expressing a recombinant β1a subunit with YFP and a biotin acceptor domain attached to its N- and C- termini, respectively. DHPR complexes were purified from skeletal muscle, negatively stained, imaged by electron microscopy, and subjected to single-particle image analysis. The resulting 19.1-Å resolution, three-dimensional reconstruction shows a main body of 17 × 11 × 8 nm with five corners along its perimeter. Two protrusions emerge from either face of the main body: the larger one attributed to the α2-δ1 subunit that forms a flexible hook-shaped feature and a smaller protrusion on the opposite side that corresponds to the II-III loop of CaV1.1 as revealed by antibody labeling. Novel features discernible in the electron density accommodate the atomic coordinates of a voltage-gated sodium channel and of the β subunit in a single docking possibility that defines the α1-β interaction. The β subunit appears more closely associated to the membrane than expected, which may better account for both its role in localizing the α1s subunit to the membrane and its suggested role in excitation-contraction coupling.

Voltage-gated calcium channels.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a003947Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR)) is a heteropentameric membrane protein complex formed by a Ca2+ channel pore-forming subunit (CaV1.1) and four auxiliary subunits (α2-δ1,β1a, γ). The DHPR senses depolarization in the sarcolemma and induces RyR1 to open and release Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm for muscle contraction (2.Tanabe T. Beam K.G.

Because in skeletal muscle the activation of RyR1 by the L-type Ca2+ channel is independent of extracellular Ca2+ entry, it is widely held that signaling between these two channels involves “conformational coupling” (reviewed in Ref. 4.Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Ryanodine receptors of striated muscles. A complex channel capable of multiple interactions.Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This conformational EC coupling is mediated by a highly organized macromolecular complex whereby the large cytoplasmic domain of RyR1 acts as a hub for the assembly of up to four DHPR units (5.Paolini C.

The α1S subunit of DHPR, or CaV1.1, is the largest subunit (176 kDa), mainly composed of a transmembrane domain that constitutes both the Ca2+ channel pore and the voltage sensor. It belongs to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily, consisting of four repeats with six transmembrane helices each (S1-S6) (6.Yu F.H. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Gutman G.A. Catterall W.A.

Further discernment of subunits has been difficult because of inherent flexibility of the macromolecule, potential loss of subunits during the purification procedure, relatively small size for TEM, and the presence of detergent surrounding the membrane-embedded region. In addition, isolation of a sufficient amount of material for single-particle image processing of this channel complex has been challenging. Here we devised a comprehensive approach to simplify the purification of an intact macromolecular complex by creating a transgenic mouse that was used to express a functional recombinant DHPR complex with YFP and biotin bound to its β1a subunit (34.Lorenzon N.M. Haarmann C.S. Norris E.E. Papadopoulos S. Beam K.G. Metabolic biotinylation as a probe of supramolecular structure of the triad junction in skeletal muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44057-44064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using a negative stain, TEM, and single-particle analysis methodology, we obtained a 19.1-Å 3D reconstruction of the recombinant DHPR complex. The 3D structure consists of a flat irregular main body with five pronounced corners, a flexible extension emerging from one of the faces, and a smaller protuberance extending from the opposite face, and its high definition enabled simultaneous docking of the atomic coordinates of a voltage-gated cation channel, a β subunit, and YFP. Decoration of the DHPR with an anti- II-III loop antibody allowed the mapping of this functional domain within the 3D structure. Our results significantly refine the structure of the DHPR complex and demonstrate the advantage of the use of animal transgenesis for the production and isolation of native heteromeric transmembrane protein complexes for structural analysis. The YFP-β1a-BAD cDNA construct was made as reported previously (34.Lorenzon N.M. Haarmann C.S. Norris E.E. Papadopoulos S. Beam K.G. Metabolic biotinylation as a probe of supramolecular structure of the triad junction in skeletal muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44057-44064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Targeted expression to skeletal muscle was achieved by cloning YFP-β1a-BAD cDNA under control of the human skeletal actin (HSA) promoter (35.Muscat G.E. Kedes L. Multiple 5′-flanking regions of the human α-skeletal actin gene synergistically modulate muscle-specific expression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4089-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For this, a 2882-bp fragment from the pHSAvpA vector (a gift from Dr. J. Chamberlain) containing 2409 bp of the HSA promoter, 293 bp of the 5′ end of HSA intron 1, and 473 bp of the splice acceptor sequence from SV40 (VP1 intron) was cloned upstream of the YFP-β1a-BAD coding sequence. The complete 5648-bp YFP-β1a-BAD expression construct, including a skeletal actin promoter and a SV40 poly(A) region, was excised and microinjected into fertilized mouse eggs (FVB/N) by the Massachusetts General Hospital transgenic facility, Charlestown, MA, with approval of the Harvard University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Genotyping of transgenic mice was performed by PCR analysis of genomic tail DNA using the forward primer 5′-GAAGGGTTGCAAATATCATTTGGGC-3′, corresponding to bp 2624–2648 of the HSA promoter sequence and the reverse primer 5′-GTCGTGCTGCTTCATGTGGTCGGGG-3′, corresponding to bp 224–249 of the YFP cDNA sequence. Transgenic mice expressing HSA-YFP-β1a-BAD were then crossbred with heterozygous β1-null mice (F1) and subsequently backcrossed (F2) to select for homozygous β1-null animals expressing only the transgenic YFP-β1a-BAD subunit. Flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibers were isolated and bathed in an “internal solution” of 140 mm Cs-Aspartate, 10 mm Cs2EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) with CsOH. The cells were permeabilized by exposure for 30 s to saponin (Sigma, 12 mg/ml in internal solution). Following a wash in internal solution, the cells were incubated in Alexa Fluor 594-nanogold streptavidin (Invitrogen, 1:500 in internal solution) for 30 min, washed for 30 min with internal solution, and then viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. YFP was visualized with 488-nm excitation and 505–530-nm band-pass emission. Alexa Fluor 594 was visualized with 543-nm excitation and 560-nm long-pass emission. Images were acquired as the average of four to eight line scans per pixel and digitized at 8 bits. DHPR was purified from the skeletal muscle of mice expressing DHPR containing β1a subunit with YFP and a BAD domain attached to its N- and C- termini, respectively. Purification was performed under the presence of protease inhibitors at 4 °C. Skeletal muscle was excised from the animal and homogenized, and whole membrane vesicles were isolated by differential centrifugation. The vesicle fraction (16–75 mg of total protein) was solubilized with 1% (w/v) digitonin (Sigma) in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm iodoacetamide) and a protein/detergent (w/w) ratio of 5–7 for 40 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 70 min (31.Wolf M.

Peak fractions were pooled and loaded onto a HiTrap streptavidin column (GE). Binding occurred by the affinity between the streptavidin resin and the metabolically biotinylated BAD domain of the β1a subunit (34.Lorenzon N.M. Haarmann C.S. Norris E.E. Papadopoulos S. Beam K.G.

Bound proteins were eluted with 5 mm D-desthiobiotin, and peak fractions were concentrated ∼10-fold with a centrifugal filter (MWCO, 100 kDa).

The grid was washed twice with Milli Q water and then negatively stained with 0.75% uranyl formate as described previously (39.Ohi M. Li Y. Cheng Y. Walz T.

Images were collected on a FEI Tecnai T12 TEM operated at 120 kV and a magnification of ×67,000 at 0°, 45°, or 60° tilt angles under low-dose conditions (< 20 e−/Å2). Images were recorded on image plates.

Images were binned down to a final pixel size 4.48 Å, and particles were windowed with final window sizes of 1302 pixels for the DHPR complex and 1252 pixels for the DHPR-antibody dataset.

Particles with low cross-correlation were discarded, with 2,693 particles in the final 3D reconstruction. Resolution was calculated according to the Fourier shell correlation curve between two half datasets, providing a value of 19.1 Å at the 0.5 cutoff criterion. The 3D reconstruction was filtered to 19.1 Å using a Gaussian low-pass filter. Image rendering was performed with Chimera (43.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M.

We constructed a transgenic mouse expressing a recombinant β1a subunit under control of the HSA promoter for specific expression in skeletal muscle (44.Brennan K.J. Hardeman E.C. Quantitative analysis of the human α-skeletal actin gene in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant β1a subunit was engineered as a fusion protein (YFP-β-BAD), with YFP fused to the N terminus and a BAD fused to the C terminus. Transgenic mice overexpressing the recombinant β1a subunit were crossed with heterozygous β1a-null mice and bred to homozygosity for both the transgene and the β1a-null allele. Although homozygous β1a null mice have a birth-lethal phenotype (22.Gregg R.G. Messing A. Strube C. Beurg M. Moss R. Behan M. Sukhareva M. Haynes S. Powell J.A. Coronado R. Powers P.A. Absence of the β subunit (cchb1) of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor alters expression of the α 1 subunit and eliminates excitation-contraction coupling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13961-13966Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the mice homozygous both for the β1a-null allele and for the YFP-β-BAD transgene were viable and appeared healthy, indicating that DHPR complexes containing the recombinant β1a subunit were functional for EC coupling. Fig. 1 illustrates the subcellular distribution of the YFP-β-BAD transgene in a flexor digitorum brevis fiber that had been permeabilized with saponin and then exposed to 1 nm fluoro-nanogold streptavidin. The yellow fluorescence arising from the YFP tag was arrayed in double rows having a center-to-center spacing of ∼2 μm, consistent with a T-tubular localization. Furthermore, the red fluorescence arising from the bound fluoro-gold streptavidin colocalized with the yellow fluorescence, indicating that there is effective biotinylation of the BAD attached to the β1a C terminus and that its disposition in triad junctions makes it accessible to a moderately sized (1 nm) probe, consistent with previous work on myotubes (34.Lorenzon N.M. Haarmann C.S. Norris E.E. Papadopoulos S. Beam K.G. Metabolic biotinylation as a probe of supramolecular structure of the triad junction in skeletal muscle.J. Biol.

This previous work also showed that EC coupling was not impaired when streptavidin bound to YFP-β-BAD in myotubes (45.Lorenzon N.M. Beam K.G.

As expected for a muscle-specific promoter, the YFP-β-BAD construct was expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, although a modest expression was also observed in liver and heart (Fig. 2A). The DHPR was purified from skeletal muscle, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Silver staining of SDS gels indicated the purity of the preparation, and the presen"

As a key contribution, we extend this framework to multiple classes, providing a new joint Scatter SVM algorithm, at the level of its binary counterpart in the number of optimization variables. This enables us to implement computationally efficient solvers based on sequential minimal and chunking optimization. As a further contribution, the primal problem formulation is developed in terms of regularized risk minimization and the hinge loss, revealing the score function to be used in the actual classification of test patterns. We investigate Scatter SVM properties related to generalization ability, computational efficiency, sparsity and sensitivity maps, and report promising results."
https://openalex.org/W2049824648,"Background The cephalopod mollusk Sepia officinalis can be considered as a relevant model for studying reproduction strategies associated to seasonal migrations. Using transcriptomic and peptidomic approaches, we aim to identify peptide sex pheromones that are thought to induce the aggregation of mature cuttlefish in their egg-laying areas. Results To facilitate the identification of sex pheromones, 576 5′-expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced from a single cDNA library generated from accessory sex glands of female cuttlefish. Our analysis yielded 223 unique sequences composed of 186 singletons and 37 contigs. Three major redundant ESTs called SPα, SPα′ and SPβ were identified as good candidates for putative sex pheromone transcripts and are part of the 87 unique sequences classified as unknown. The alignment of translated SPα and SPα′ revealed a high level of conservation, with 98.4% identity. Translation led to a 248-amino acid precursor containing six peptides with multiple putative disulfide bonds. The alignment of SPα-α′ with SPβ revealed a partial structural conservation, with 37.3% identity. Translation of SPβ led to a 252-amino acid precursor containing five peptides. The occurrence of a signal peptide on SPα, SPα′ and SPβ showed that the peptides were secreted. RT-PCR and mass spectrometry analyses revealed a co-localization of transcripts and expression products in the oviduct gland. Preliminary in vitro experiments performed on gills and penises revealed target organs involved in mating and ventilation. Conclusions The analysis of the accessory sex gland transcriptome of Sepia officinalis led to the identification of peptidic sex pheromones. Although preliminary functional tests suggested the involvement of the α3 and β2 peptides in ventilation and mating stimulation, further functional investigations will make it possible to identify the complete set of biological activities expected from waterborne pheromones."
https://openalex.org/W1975263530,"Objectives To determine the predictive value and sensitivity of demographic features and injuries (indicators) for maltreatment-related codes in hospital discharge records of children admitted with a head or neck injury or fracture. Methods Study design: Population-based, cross sectional study. Setting: NHS hospitals in England. Subjects: Children under five years old admitted acutely to hospital with head or neck injury or fracture. Data source: Hospital Episodes Statistics, 1997 to 2009. Main outcome measure: Maltreatment-related injury admissions, defined by ICD10 codes, were used to calculate for each indicator (demographic feature and/or type of injury): i) the predictive value (proportion of injury admissions that were maltreatment-related); ii) sensitivity (proportion of all maltreatment-related injury admissions with the indicator). Results Of 260,294 childhood admissions for fracture or head or neck injury, 3.2% (8,337) were maltreatment-related. With increasing age of the child, the predictive value for maltreatment-related injury declined but sensitivity increased. Half of the maltreatment-related admissions occurred in children older than one year, and 63% occurred in children with head injuries without fractures or intracranial injury. Conclusions Highly predictive injuries accounted for very few maltreatment-related admissions. Protocols that focus on high-risk injuries may miss the majority of maltreated children."
https://openalex.org/W1978900565,"In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that countries use artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to treat malaria patients ( 1 ), as continued use of artemisinin monotherapies and substandard drugs had the potential to lead to widespread resistance to artemisinin, the most effective drug for malaria. But ACTs were unaffordable for most people in malaria-endemic countries, particularly in the private for-profit sector where most people seek treatment. Artemisinin monotherapies and the threat of resistance remain a problem. Resistance has now emerged in Cambodia and is spreading to Myanmar and Vietnam ( 2 ). Despite WHO's efforts, monotherapies are produced by 37 pharmaceutical companies and marketed in 29 countries ( 3 ). Although resistance to artemisinin had not been detected at the time of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report in 2004 ( 4 ), an IOM committee proposed a global subsidy high in the distribution chain, both to make ACTs inexpensive and to displace artemisinin monotherapy and other ineffective drugs."
